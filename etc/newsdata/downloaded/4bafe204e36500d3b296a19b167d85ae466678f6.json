This marks the second time Vale has been arrested for contempt after continuing his Apricots From God enterprise despite warnings to shut it down; he was convicted in 2003 and sentenced to five years in prison for the crime. Jason and his 77-year-old mother, Barbara Vale, are also charged with introducing items into commerce by making false statements.\n\nAD\n\nOn Wednesday, officials from the New York City Department of Environmental Protection also found drums of hazardous liquid in the home\u2019s garage, although it\u2019s unclear what the substance was, WABC reported.\n\nAccording to the federal complaint, Vale and his mother have raked in $850,000 since 2013 selling apricot seeds and related products containing amygdalin or laetrile. The FDA does not support these products for treating or curing cancer, making their sale for medicinal purposes illegal. In fact, the National Cancer Institute has found that the cyanide contained in apricot seeds or laetrile can cause poisoning, which can be deadly. Vale\u2019s website does not appear to contain any such warning.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe Answer to Cancer is known!\u201d Vale writes on the website. \u201cJust a few seeds per day\u201d \u2014 although Vale prefers to eat up to 30 per day, he says.\n\nAD\n\nBarbara Vale was released on a $100,000 bond later Wednesday, while her son was taken to the hospital after his arrest for an undisclosed medical issue, NBC 4 reported. Attorneys for both Jason and Barbara Vale declined to comment.\n\nJason Vale\u2019s story began when he survived cancer at 18 after a \u201cgrapefruit size tumor\u201d was removed from his torso, and again at 19, when the tumors returned, his lawyer told a judge in 2000. He endured chemotherapy, but when the cancer came back again several years later, Vale didn\u2019t want to go through the brutal treatment again.\n\nAD\n\nSo he turned to apricot seeds \u2014 and claimed they worked.\n\nThe arm wrestler would go on to win two national titles and the 1997-1998 world super heavyweight arm-wrestling championship in Petaluma, Calif., reportedly the lightest arm wrestler to ever win the title. His basement turned into a makeshift wrestling ring, except the mat was on a small table, where some of the best arm wrestlers from around the country sat across from one another. All the while, according to reports in the Village Voice and Queens Chronicle at the time, he used his rising platform in the arm-wrestling world to share his story, to thank God \u2014 and to credit the apricot seeds.\n\nAD\n\nHe started selling them on the Internet in the mid-1990s, a legally murky time for the nascent World Wide Web. According to a 2004 Queens Chronicle report, Vale\u2019s business, named Christian Brothers, obtained mailing lists of AOL members and sent out more than 20 million spam emails touting the power of apricot seeds and laetrile to treat cancer.\n\nAD\n\nBy 1997, he was on the FDA\u2019s radar.\n\n\u201cI used it, shouted about it and then got thrown in prison for the sale of the legal food, apricot seeds,\u201d Vale wrote on his website, \u201cdespite not one personal complaint and hundreds of individuals claiming victory over their illness.\u201d\n\nThe agency sued him in 1999 to compel him to stop the online sale of the seeds and related products. Pressed on his beliefs during a deposition in 2000, Vale said he believed apricot seeds \u201ccan help a person in a lot of different areas in their health.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBut ... I personally don\u2019t think it\u2019s a cure,\u201d he concluded. \u201cI believe there is no cure.\u201d\n\nHe said he would have a hard time quitting the sale of the seeds if a judge ordered him to stop, but said he would ultimately agree to comply.\n\nAD\n\nHe didn\u2019t. He emerged from prison in 2008 still preaching the powers of the seeds, both for arm wrestling and cancer.\n\n\u201cI want to be No. 1 again, not for myself, but as part of my mission to show the world the power of apricot seeds,\u201d he told the New York Times in 2008, adding: \u201cThe same way that arm-wrestling gave me an edge against cancer, as a competitor, the apricot seeds are also an edge. They are the answer to cancer.\u201d\n\nThe National Cancer Institute says otherwise. In a 1982 government-sponsored study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the institute found that laetrile produced \u201cno therapeutic benefit\u201d against cancer, and that in fact, 90 percent of patients\u2019 cancer worsened within three months after beginning the treatment.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nVale and his mother, by contrast, have claimed that out of the thousands of customers who have ordered products from Apricots From God, they have received no complaints. Vale has urged cancer survivors to \u201cplease remember to continue your entire life on the seeds,\u201d or else risk the return of cancer.\n\nIn fact, on his website, Vale specifically claims: \u201cNo matter how many people we CURED with apricot seeds, the vitamin B-17 that is found in them and some other aids, it does not matter. As a matter of fact, we have had over a 90 percent success rate with the apricot seeds and other aids, but our records do not matter.\u201d\n\nThe FDA challenged their supposed lack of complaints by including an email addressed to Barbara Vale from a customer, who had purchased products from the website, including B-17 powder.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe day after eating a \u201cscoop\u201d of the product, he was suffering \u201csevere poisoning,\u201d experiencing vertigo and vomiting, he said. His mother and a friend had eaten the apricot kernels and \u201cfelt their thinking went blurred,\u201d he wrote. He said he had read the articles saying that \u201camygdalin as a cancer cure\u201d was a bunch of quackery, but \u201cI\u2019m a bit concerned now.\"\n\nBarbara forwarded the email to Jason, and did not respond.\n\nAD", "description": "The FDA told Jason Vale, a pro arm wrestler, to stop peddling apricot seeds as a cure for cancer 20 years ago, but he's allegedly still at it.", "authors": ["Meagan Flynn", "Morning Mix Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/f6vwIQ_iGRikJjFzCe3pJ71VamI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XZRN4DYOM5BOLML4ATMRY3ZZXQ.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
