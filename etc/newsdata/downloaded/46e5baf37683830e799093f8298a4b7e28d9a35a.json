Oxycodone manufacturing, for example, grew by 400% from 2002 to 2013.\n\nBut the Obama years saw the epidemic explode, with tens of thousands of deaths a year, yet the DEA in 2013 cut back on its most powerful weapon, \u201cimmediate suspension orders,\u201d which allow it to ban pharmacies from distributing drugs.\n\nThe DEA issued 45 suspension orders in 2012, but over the next five years, issued just 43 in total, the Justice Department inspector general said.\n\n\u201cWe found that DEA was slow to respond to this growing public health crisis,\u201d said Michael E. Horowitz, the inspector general.\n\nHe said the DEA has improved since then, building its capacity to enforce the law and law and fostering better cooperation with state and local authorities who are on the front lines.\n\nStill, he said, the agency needs to update its regulations and find better ways to track emerging drug epidemics so it can get a handle on things faster.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
