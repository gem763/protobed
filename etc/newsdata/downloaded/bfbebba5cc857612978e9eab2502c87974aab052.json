We hope that when he next visits he will be able to see the importance of whisky industry to the economy in Scotland\u2026and perhaps he might think again.\"\n\nThe tariff is on single malt whisky made by smaller producers rather than blended malts made by the likes of Diageo. But, she said, that there was a logic to the decision as it responds to an EU tariff that was put in place in retaliation for the dispute over steel tariffs.\n\n\u201cIt's a blow to the industry and disappointing that the Scottish whisky is bearing more than half the burden of the UK's tariff liability. Because they have targeted the tariffs against single malts, there is going to be a disproportionate impact on small businesses.\"\n\n\"Many of our small producer only produce single malts and they all export to the US so all their imports are going to be hit,\" she said.\n\nThe changes also come at a time when the industry is facing a no-deal Brexit and the run-up to Christmas.", "description": "All the day's business news and views from the UK and beyond, as it happens.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://m.files.bbci.co.uk/modules/bbc-morph-news-waf-page-meta/4.0.0/bbc_news_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
