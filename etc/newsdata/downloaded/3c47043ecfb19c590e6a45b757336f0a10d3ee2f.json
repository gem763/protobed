Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), an ally of Trump\u2019s, a day before Mulvaney\u2019s press conference. \u201cI do know there's a lot of things that get said that aren't backed up with facts. I'm waiting for the facts to come out before I jump to any conclusions.\u201d\n\nBut others are not so kind when assessing the role Mulvaney is now playing, arguing that he finds himself in over his head as he tries to guide the White House through turbulent political waters.\n\n\u201cHe is a smart guy, a very smart guy, but he\u2019s only about 70 percent as smart as he thinks he is,\u201d said Republican strategist Terry Sullivan, who has known Mulvaney since the acting chief of staff\u2019s days in the South Carolina State Senate. \u201cThere\u2019s only one person in that entire White House that has a bigger ego than he does, but it\u2019s not by much.\u201d\n\nThe trickiness of Mulvaney\u2019s task\u2014and the difficulty he is having handling it\u2014was on full display Thursday. It was about 20 minutes into the briefing when he was asked whether he was directly involved in withholding funds from Ukraine. After riffing about the president\u2019s dislike of foreign aid, belief the U.S. shoulders too much of it in proportion to others and that the country is corrupt anyway, Mulvaney touched on the 2016 race.\n\n\u201cDid he also mention to me in the past that the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely,\u201d he said. \u201cNo question about that. But that\u2019s it. That\u2019s why we held up the money.\u201d\n\nAfter pillioring former State Department adviser Michael McKinley who reportedly testified he left the administration because \u201cdisturbed by the implication that foreign governments were being approached to procure negative information on political opponents,\u201d Mulvaney went in for the kill.\n\n\u201cI have news for everybody. Get over it,\u201d he advised. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be political influence in foreign policy...Elections have consequences and foreign policy is going to change from the Obama administration to the Trump administration.\u201d\n\nAs wild\u2014damning, even\u2014as the admissions may have seemed, Mulvaney actually had the intention of bringing the temperature down, with hopes of clearing the air after his name had cropped up in press reports implicating him in the Ukraine-related scandal. He wanted to \u201ctake allegations head on, and show he wasn\u2019t going into hiding,\u201d one White House official said.\n\n\u201cMight as well own it,\u201d the official added.\n\nAnd own it he did\u2014but only for part of the day.\n\nHours after the briefing, Mulvaney tried to backtrack, saying in a statement released by the White House press office: \u201cLet me be clear: there was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election.\u201d He also claimed that \u201conce again, the media has decided to misconstrue my comments to advance a biased and political witch hunt against President Trump.\u201d\n\nBy that point, however, real damage had been done. Mulvaney\u2019s earlier round of comments had left some close White House allies utterly perplexed and questioning his fitness for the role.\n\n\u201cWhat is Mulvaney even talking about?\u201d Sean Hannity, a Fox News host and prominent outside adviser to Trump, said on his radio show on Thursday. \u201cI just think he's dumb, I really do. I don't even think he knows what he's talking about. That's my take on it.\u201d", "description": "Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily BeastOver the course of about 40 minutes on Thursday, President Donald Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, made two startling admissions: that U.S. military aid to Ukrainian had been contingent on an investigation into a debunked 2016 election-interference", "authors": ["Jackie Kucinich", "Asawin Suebsaeng", "Sam Brodey"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/pGXsc3vS4efET17EObl0DA--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/c77d7a26dd0d412fc10f98eb2aee7f41", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
