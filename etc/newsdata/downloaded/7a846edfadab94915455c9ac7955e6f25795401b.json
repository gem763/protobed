The chasm is most prevalent in wealthy coastal states and areas with \"widespread poverty,\" she wrote.\n\nWhile the median household income in the US also reached an all-time high \u2014 just over $63,000 \u2014 it's about the same as it was two decades ago when adjusted for inflation, according to Telford.\n\nThis stagnant growth underscores a 2018 report by the Pew Research Center, which found that America's middle class is shrinking \u2014 while it's stable in size, it's financial gains were \"modest\" compared to higher income households.\n\nAn Insider and Morning Consult survey from earlier this year also found that middle-class America isn't faring that well.

It examined the growing concentration of wealth in the US by looking at 15 dynastically wealthy families from the Forbes 400 list and data from the Federal Reserve Survey of Consumer Finance.\n\nSince 1982, the combined wealth of the top three families \u2014 the Waltons, the Kochs, and the Marses \u2014 increased by 5,868%, totaling $348.7 billion, the report found.\n\nBut some billionaires are thinking twice about how they're tackling generational wealth. Bill Gates and Warren Buffett plan to give most of their money away through the Giving Pledge, instead of keeping it in the family.\n\nBuffett has been vocal about his efforts to reduce the vast wealth sitting in the hands of a few influential people. \"Dynastic wealth, the enemy of a meritocracy, is on the rise,\" Buffett said during a Senate Finance Committee hearing about the federal estate tax 2007. \"Equality of opportunity has been on the decline.\"", "description": "Income inequality is the highest it's ever been \u2014 and the median household income has barely grown in 20 years when adjusted for inflation.", "authors": ["Hillary Hoffower"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8e17532e22af175d406385?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
