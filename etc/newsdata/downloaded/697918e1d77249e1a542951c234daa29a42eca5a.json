The company behind the marketing campaign offers a range of crypto financial services including custody, trading, and lending.\n\nSuch large scale public marketing efforts have been conducted previously by companies. Although paid promotion by the companies behind them, the proliferation of these types of campaigns will likely do a lot towards normalising BTC in popular culture, eventually.\n\nBitcoin Tram Pushes Crypto in the Streets\n\nBitcoin has hit the streets of Zurich, Switzerland today in impressive fashion. As seen in the video below, at least one of the city\u2019s trams have become a billboard for one of the many cryptocurrency startups of the nation. The massive Bitcoin Suisse motif spreads across all five carriages of the inner city transport option.\n\nBitcoin Suisse, the company behind the marketing campaign, is a nationally regulated financial intermediary and crypto services provider. It is based in Zug, Switzerland, an area that has attracted many Bitcoin startups thanks to its favourable regulations.\n\nAlthough clearly a marketing effort to attract new users to the crypto services platform (a Reddit post with the video says that the tram was spotted in the financial district of Zurich), thrusting Bitcoin into the public\u2019s face in such a way is definitely a positive for the industry on the whole. After all, many people still think of BTC as a tool for money laundering or drug dealing thanks to early negative coverage.\n\nGranted, spotting a prominent crypto company\u2019s branding on a tram isn\u2019t going to make someone immediately forget their ill-conceived judgements about the digital asset space but repeated exposure in a myriad of ways will eventually normalise the still-difficult-to-accept digital asset. Mentions of Bitcoin in popular culture, seeing \u201cBitcoin accepted here\u201d at retailers (both online and in the real world), and even street art inspired by the cryptocurrency will all help erode the misconceptions people have about the breakthrough technology.\n\nPreviously, NewsBTC has reported on this slow road to the normalisation of the number one crypto by market capitalisation in reference to many topics. Examples include the Bitcoin monument in erected in Slovenia and the Grayscale \u201cDrop Gold\u201d campaign.\n\nThere is even something to be said for controversial Bitcoin payment processors in this regard. Although household names like AT&T aren\u2019t ready to accept Bitcoin properly, customers can still pay for products using crypto via a payment processor. This is powerful in terms of BTC normalisation since users, whether interested in crypto or not, will still see the Bitcoin logo when they arrive at the checkout for whatever it might be that they\u2019re purchasing.\n\nRelated Reading: Hong Kong Free Press Fires BitPay Over Bitcoin Payment Delays\n\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock.", "description": "Footage posted by a Swiss crypto startup earlier today shows a tram emblazoned with the word \"Bitcoin\" and the firm's branding travelling through the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_1432877117-1200x780.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
