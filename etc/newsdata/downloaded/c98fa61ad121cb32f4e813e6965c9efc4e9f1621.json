The framework is for referees, not the players, and used to decide whether there are red or yellow cards in a game. In my view, the officials in this tournament are using that framework very well.\n\n\n\n\u201cSecond, our players are coached to tackle around the middle where they can dislodge the ball. We do not need the framework to tell them how to tackle. I am not sure where that is coming from and I do not know why it was put in the judgement.\n\n\n\n\u201cI do not know why they did it. I do not particularly want to talk about this today because there is a part of it which is us versus everyone else. We know that and we are not going to let it derail us. We will suck it up and get focused on what is important \u2013 the match on Sunday. We are not going to let them get to us. We will concentrate on our footy and do our best for Australia.\u201d", "description": "Follow the latest updates live from the Rugby World Cup as heavyweights Australia\u00a0and Wales\u00a0meet in what promises to be a thrilling Pool D\u00a0encounter.
