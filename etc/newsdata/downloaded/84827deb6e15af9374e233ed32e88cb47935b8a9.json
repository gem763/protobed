He was slated to pitch for the Chicago White Sox on Tuesday at Minnesota, but the team announced the injury after its 5-3 loss to the Twins in the series opener.\n\n\u201cIf we were in the playoff hunt at this point, I\u2019d be arguing as much as I could to go out there and pitch and compete,\u201d Giolito said Monday. \u201cI feel like with how I felt yesterday, I probably would have been able to get through it, but just understanding the situation it\u2019s probably for the best to shut it down.\u201d\n\nThe 25-year-old Giolito went 14-9 with a 3.41 ERA in 29 starts this year. He also had the first three complete games of his career.\n\nEven with Giolito\u2019s performance, the White Sox are a distant third in the AL Central with a 65-85 record.\n\n\u201cCertainly an incredible season for Lucas, even though it\u2019s a couple starts short of a full season,\u201d White Sox general manager Rick Hahn said. \u201cStill one that, in my opinion, certainly merits Cy Young consideration and I suspect he\u2019ll receive some votes here once the votes are ultimately tabulated and something that he can obviously go into the offseason feeling proud about.\u201d\n\nHahn said Giolito felt something Sunday when he went to throw a side session. An MRI on Monday revealed the lat strain, which Hahn said would typically require several weeks of recovery.\n\nRoss Detwiler will start Tuesday in Giolito\u2019s place.\n\nGiolito was acquired in the December 2016 trade that sent Adam Eaton to Washington. He was selected by the Nationals in the first round of the 2012 draft.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s doing ace-type stuff, and we\u2019ll let time tell us as we continue to throw him out there and compete, what you guys will ultimately want to label him,\u201d manager Rick Renteria said. \u201cI see him as an ace-type guy.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Lucas Giolito's breakout season is over.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tyler Mason"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/12/royals_white_sox_baseball_99287_c0-183-4370-2730_s1770x1032.jpg?c16f098211e553c88be2b91a5943eec67e8aab82", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
