She pushed him away, she told The New Yorker last year, causing her to touch his penis.\n\nRamirez came forward with her allegation after Christine Blasey Ford publicly accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault when they were teenagers. Ford testified at his Supreme Court nomination hearing.\n\nThe authors of the new Kavanaugh book note tonight that they didn\u2019t interview Kavanaugh because his condition was that they state they hadn\u2019t. That is, he would only speak to them if they agreed to write in their book, dishonestly, that he hadn\u2019t. pic.twitter.com/VYzZdd4zDT \u2014 Alexandra (@AlexandraWrage) September 18, 2019\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nNYT Reporters Say They Uncovered New Sexual Misconduct Claim Against Kavanaugh\n\n2020 Candidates Call For Kavanaugh Impeachment After New Misconduct Accusation\n\nLindsey Graham 'Promises' Kavanaugh Won't Be Impeached After New Misconduct Allegation\n\nLove HuffPost?
