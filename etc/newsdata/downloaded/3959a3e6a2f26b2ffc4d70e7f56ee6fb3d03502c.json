It\u2019s a lifestyle! No, its just a real estate company.", "language": "en", "text": "The rise, fall and further fall of the massively popular purveyor of shared office space is already being spun into narratives about Silicon Valley speculation, or venture capital, more generally. Companies achieve dizzying valuations while they\u2019re private, and then an unenthusiastic stock market knocks them over.\n\nBut WeWork might be less a harbinger of a collapse to come than it is a warning about a company that trapped itself between our brave new world and the old one we haven\u2019t quite left behind.\n\nWeWork worked because it injected the digital ethos into what was essentially an analog experience. It offered office space but sexier \u2014 if sexy looks like coffee and kombucha and beer all on tap, all (at least at first) unlimited. The company\u2019s very name radiates everything the Internet era has to give; not the \u201ci\u201d that Apple sticks in front of everything to make it sound sleek and shiny, but a \u201cwe\u201d instead, because this is supposedly the age of connection.\n\nThe product was useful. Businesses need somewhere to base themselves, and smaller businesses need smaller spaces. But it was also compelling. \u201cDigital juggernaut revolutionizing our 9 to 5s\u201d sounds a hell of a lot better than \u201coffice subleasing company.\u201d\n\nThe problem is, WeWork took it too far.\n\nThe tech ethos, to Neumann, couldn\u2019t only be an ethos. WeWork had to dramatically alter people\u2019s lives, much like the rest of Silicon Valley was altering lives \u2014 and the lives of its employees, and especially its leader, had to match the high-rolling habits of the Bay Area\u2019s best.\n\nSo WeWork bought a marketing platform, and a meetups platform, and a coding academy, and an app for construction worker communications, and \u2014 a hefty chunk of a manufacturer of wave pools? Revenue was doubling annually, but expenses were doing one better, which meant one worse. WeWork seemed to light every incoming dollar on fire.\n\nVanity Fair reported that Neumann claimed he had cajoled Rahm Emanuel into running for president on \u201cthe WeWork agenda,\u201d whatever that is. He claimed he was partnering with Mohammad bin Salman to save Saudi Arabian women by teaching them to code; he claimed Jamie Dimon might leave JPMorgan Chase to run Neumann\u2019s family investment fund. The Wall Street Journal reported that he wanted to be a trillionaire! He wanted to run the world, literally! He wanted to live, baby \u2014 forever!\n\nWhen you\u2019re a tech company, you can sometimes get away with all this. Network effects can eventually win you back the money you spent to build your network in the first place. Growth costs are low. Oh, and haven\u2019t you heard data is the new oil? All these new truths at least present the possibility of sustainability for tech titans-to-be. But for a real estate business dealing almost exclusively in physical space, they\u2019re not really part of the equation.\n\nWhen you\u2019re a tech company, you can sometimes get away with an erratic chief executive, too, because in Silicon Valley, erratic equals eccentric, and eccentric often equals genius. Neumann reportedly joked recently that dealing with the Securities and Exchange Commission had made him sympathize with Elon Musk \u2014 as if he weren\u2019t flying at Muskian altitudes already, gliding on a Gulfstream G650 above the Atlantic Ocean and smoking marijuana contra transnational rules. But Elon Musk makes electric cars.\n\nAnd when you\u2019re a tech company, you can almost always get away with carrying off a jaw-dropping initial public offering. WeWork hooked nearly 11 billion of SoftBank\u2019s dollars by selling fund manager Masayoshi Son on its far-reaching vision, but the Silicon Valley venture-capital market was reluctant to bite. Investors weren\u2019t convinced WeWork was a tech company. And here\u2019s the rub: The tried-and-true property industry wasn\u2019t interested either, because WeWork had so thoroughly convinced enough people that it was a tech company that its price-tag had spiked too high.\n\nAdam Neumann wanted to \u201celevate the world\u2019s consciousness.\u201d Now, if a friend of mine spending his days in one of its spaces is to be believed, his landlord has been reducing the amount of fruit in the complimentary fruit water. WeWork\u2019s quest to be something more ended up making it a whole lot less.\n\nRead more:\n\nMolly Roberts: What to do when everything you buy is a little bit evil\n\nMegan McArdle: What\u2019s making tech unicorns lose their magic?\n\nMegan McArdle: Treating Uber and Lyft drivers in California as company employees is not going to work\n\nAlex Karp: I\u2019m a tech CEO, and I don\u2019t think tech CEOs should be making policy\n\nKatherine Boyle: Goodbye, trolley problem.
