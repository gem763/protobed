Friedman said Monday that he expects his own extension to be finalized in the next few days.\n\nRoberts led the team to its seventh straight NL West title and a franchise-record 106 wins - second-most in the majors - but he\u2019s been criticized for his pitching decisions in losing Game 5 of the NL Division Series to Washington.\n\nFriedman defended Roberts\u2019 performance in his four years with the team, including NL pennants in 2017 and \u201818.\n\nFriedman also said 65-year-old pitching coach Rick Honeycutt would transition to a special assistant role next season, which would be his 15th with the Dodgers.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts and president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman will be back next season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Beth Harris"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/14/dodgers_offseason_baseball_45817_c0-236-3000-1986_s1200x700.jpg?436d2cc9ae69f2cdc72ca598674edb7dd83b49ce", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
