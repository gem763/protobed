But is he telling the truth?", "language": "en", "text": "The two cold cases Miami-Dade authorities pulled from a dusty warehouse made an uncanny fit with Little\u2019s recollections, from the cement arch he said he drove under before choking Miriam Chapman to the way he buried Mary Brosley with her leg sticking out because the dirt was so hard.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe knew what the deal was because he had given these details without even talking to us,\u201d Denmark told The Washington Post.\n\nIt\u2019s those kinds of details that have convinced authorities to declare Little the most prolific serial killer in U.S. history, a title that takes more than confessions to earn. Little\u2019s late-in-life disclosures to a Texas investigator were just the start of law enforcement\u2019s efforts to confirm a record 50 killings by the same man \u2014 while avoiding the pitfalls that humiliated officials in the same state in the 1980s when another convict recanted hundreds of murder confessions.\n\nThat debacle, and a long history of police eager to close closes, has taught experts to approach confessions with great skepticism. Some met Little\u2019s macabre milestone this week with questions: What had Little been told? Could he be spinning stories based on cues from his interrogators?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut investigators say their methods are very different from those of the authorities who once let a suspected serial killer see unsolved case files. They\u2019re still working to corroborate dozens of Little\u2019s 93 murder claims.\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s kind of skeptical because unless you\u2019re working with him \u2026 it\u2019s hard to convey to somebody just how precise he is,\u201d said Angela Williamson, a liaison between the Justice Department and the FBI who\u2019s listened to many of Little\u2019s interviews.\n\n\u201cA lot of prolific killers have notes or trophies or things like that,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd for Little, it's all in his head.\u201d\n\nTroubling history\n\nFalse confessions are widely documented. One database that aims to compile every U.S. criminal exoneration since 1989 found they were given by 27 percent of people convicted and then cleared of homicide.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut few false confessions have imploded as dramatically as Henry Lee Lucas\u2019s.\n\nLucas shot to fame in 1983 after stunning a Texas courtroom \u2014 where he was on trial for an elderly woman\u2019s murder \u2014 with the declaration that he had \u201c100 more out there somewhere.\u201d The Texas Rangers, a renowned group of state investigators, got to work extracting the dark history of a man convicted of killing his mother.\n\nLucas would confess to some 600 murders as law enforcement from around the country queued up to grill him on thousands of their unsolved cases. Newspapers and TV stations described a one-eyed \u201cdrifter\u201d and fifth grade dropout who recounted his crimes with little visible emotion \u2014 like a man \u201creciting his grocery list,\u201d as reporters for The Washington Post put it.\n\nAD\n\nMore than 200 cases were cleared in Lucas\u2019s name as law enforcement touted corroborating facts and telling details.\n\nAD\n\nThen, a reporter started digging.\n\nHugh Aynesworth met Lucas in his Texas jail cell in the fall of 1983. Lucas had admitted to killing more than 150 women at that point, Aynesworth recounted, but he told the veteran journalist he\u2019d really murdered just three.\n\n\u201cThey're goin' wild every time I tell 'em about some more,\u201d Aynesworth said Lucas confided. \u201cI'm gonna show 'em. They think I'm stupid, but before all this is over, everyone will know who's really stupid. And we'll see who the real criminals are.\"\n\nTracing Lucas\u2019s travels over the years through food stamp applications, paychecks and other records, Aynesworth realized the timeline of his purported crimes didn\u2019t add up. He and another journalist concluded in a front-page article for the Dallas Times-Herald that Lucas\u2019s confessions amounted to \u201cthe largest hoax in law enforcement annals.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe revelations shocked just like Lucas\u2019s courtroom declaration less than two years earlier. They also pained the people who had gotten closure for loved ones\u2019 deaths.\n\n\u2033They don\u2019t know what this is dragging us through,\u2033 one man told the Associated Press amid new doubt about his wife\u2019s murder. \u2033It\u2019s like it just happened yesterday.\u2033\n\nThe Rangers defended their work, but Texas\u2019s Attorney General weighed in after a year-long investigation to say police ignored red flags in their eagerness to clear their books. Absent any physical evidence linking Lucas to his alleged crimes, the attorney general said, law enforcement fed the convict the case details that he wove into elaborate stories \u2014 encouraged by milkshakes, steaks, TV privileges and promises of no death penalty, according to various newspaper accounts. A Texas Monthly article notes one memo from the Rangers describing how Lucas got pictures and victim information to \u201crefresh\u201d his memory.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLaw enforcement\u2019s practices have improved since the Lucas case, said Richard Leo, an expert on police interrogation and false confessions. The University of San Francisco professor of law and psychology told The Post a nationwide shift toward recording police interviews has provided new accountability for actions that could \u201ccontaminate\u201d a confession.\n\nBut case after case of police work gone wrong has made him distrustful, and he still hears of officers who taint confessions by trying to confront suspects with bits of a case. He\u2019s seen DNA evidence exonerate people whose confessions were proclaimed too detailed to be made-up \u2014 and wished for interview recordings that could clear up where the convict got their facts.\n\n\u201cInterrogators feed details to people they interrogate without realizing it,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAlan Hirsch, who also studies false confessions, holds similar doubts. The chair of the Justice and Law Studies Program at Williams College says members of law enforcement are still too quick to believe confessions and prosecutors too willing to \u201ccherry-pick\u201d from them while discounting errors.\n\nHe and Leo also worry about the incentives for tall tales that authorities gave Henry Lee Lucas. Promises that suspects won\u2019t get the death penalty if they talk risk drawing out a false story, they said, and can get a confession suppressed in court.\n\nThe small perks can matter, too. Hirsch says he\u2019s currently consulting for the defense in a case where an alleged serial killer facing capital punishment gave more than a dozen false, \u201cever-changing\u201d confessions. The suspect\u2019s apparent motive, Hirsch said, was straightforward: He asked for coffee and cigarettes whenever he visited the interviewing room.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLittle, like Lucas, was assured he would not face the death penalty if he spilled what he knew, his lead interviewer \u2014 a Texas Ranger \u2014 has said. As with Lucas, Little\u2019s stories were coaxed out over food and milkshakes, along with friendly chit-chat and ego-stroking to build up the rapport that cracked the killer\u2019s long silence.\n\nThe Texas Rangers did not respond to inquiries, but Mary Kay Tylee, a public defender who represented Little as he pleaded guilty to murder in Ohio this summer, confirmed that her client only talks to local law enforcement after getting a letter promising no capital punishment.\n\nFrom everything Tylee\u2019s seen of the taped questionings, Little has led the conversation, the defense attorney said. She says Little is \u201cmaking the amends he can\u201d with his confessions, though she could not say whether he feels any remorse.\n\n\u201cThe stuff was really coming from him,\u201d she said.\n\nDevastating details\n\nLittle didn\u2019t talk at first.\n\nArrested in 2012 for a drug offense, he pleaded his innocence after investigators matched him to DNA found on three women strangled in Los Angeles in the 1980s. \u201cI didn\u2019t do it!\u201d he screamed out in front of the victims\u2019 family members before being sentenced, according to the Los Angeles Times. He received three lifetimes in prison without the chance of parole.\n\nChristie Palazzolo, an analyst at the FBI\u2019s Violent Criminal Apprehension Program (ViCAP), was searching a national crime database for other potential Little murders, comparing the killer\u2019s whereabouts over the years with unsolved cases. She struck on a 1994 strangling in Odessa, Tex. that \u201cjust felt like him,\u201d as she would later tell a reporter. But the pieces didn\u2019t come together until last year, when Palazzolo joined forces with Williamson from the Justice Department and Texas Ranger James Holland, who\u2019s made a specialty of extracting confessions. The three traveled to California that May to see what Little would tell them.\n\nLittle had been unwavering in his innocence, Palazzolo said. But then, after some banter, Holland asked if he had ever been to Odessa, and a torrent of details poured out: the victim\u2019s looks, the time he spent with her boyfriend, the place he left the body. Almost everything fit the case file.\n\nThen came the new stories \u2014 cases the team had never heard of but would confirm on nuances they found equally convincing, Palazzolo and Williamson recounted. Once, Little detailed a victim\u2019s last meal, they said. His account matched the contents of the woman\u2019s stomach noted down from an autopsy.\n\nLittle had a good recall for place, Palazzolo says, and with each new story, they contacted local agencies to see what they had on record. But the confessed killer was far shakier on dates \u2014 his memory of the Odessa killing was off by a decade \u2014 which typically meant combing through 20 years of files. And Little\u2019s penchant for strangling rather than shooting or stabbing meant that many of the deaths he confessed to were harder to detect as homicides. Some were recorded as drug overdoses.\n\nSometimes, local officers would probe Little about other cases they\u2019d unearthed that seemed to fit his path and methods \u2014 a practice that, when done clumsily, can raise experts\u2019s concerns about false confessions.\n\nBut unlike Henry Lee Lucas, investigators said, Little would just say, \u201cI didn\u2019t do it.\u201d That frankness helped convince Darrell Prewitt, a sheriff\u2019s lieutenant from Arkansas, who had flagged several cases but closed just the one that he says Little rattled off unprompted.\n\nThe victim in that now-solved case, pulled badly decomposed from a river, has yet to be identified. Little\u2019s startling recall could help with that, too, Prewitt said. The convict drew a picture.\n\nInvestigators started asking Little for victim portraits after discovering that his prison cell walls were covered in drawings of celebrities, Palazzolo and Williamson said. They learned he once painted a mural. Now, his portraits are posted online in the hopes they might jog new leads.\n\nFor Miami-Dade Detective Denmark, Little\u2019s artistry also offered one last tiny, damning detail rooted in meticulous police work from 1976. A nightclub owner interviewed at the time recalled seeing Miriam Chapman in the company of a man who said he\u2019d like to paint a mural on the establishment\u2019s wall.", "description": "Late-in-life disclosures were just the start of law enforcement\u2019s efforts to confirm a record 50 victims of the same man.", "authors": ["Hannah Knowles", "General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/V1Q6WCFMBIXrAV4jCOD7qUDyYfg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EL7DQVY5SFG5XHW3MSL5ME7H7U.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
