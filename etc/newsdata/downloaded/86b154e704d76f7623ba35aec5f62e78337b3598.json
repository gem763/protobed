We created a lot of chances from long passes today.\u201d\n\nBarca were without influential defender Gerard Pique due to suspension but France defender Samuel Umtiti gave a towering performance in his first start of the season after a series of knee problems.\n\nThere was one sour note for Ernesto Valverde\u2019s side, however, as right back Sergi Roberto had to be taken off at the start of the second half with a suspected knee injury.", "description": "Barcelona's attacking trident of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Antoine Griezmann all got on the scoresheet for the first time together in a 3-0 win away to Eibar which took the La Liga champions top of the table on Saturday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442678314&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I0C4", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
