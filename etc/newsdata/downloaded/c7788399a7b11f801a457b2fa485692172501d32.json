It is said to be home to the graves of several people who first brought Islam to the Malay archipelago in the 14th century.\n\nOther tourist draws include a mystical cave where warriors were said to once practise traditional martial arts, a mythical well, and a large boulder believed to grant wishes.\n\nLast year the state government pledged to rebrand the island as a tourist resort and free trade zone in an effort to eliminate \u201csuperstitious and sacred activities\u201d and promote local products, such as cocoa.", "description": "Fishermen report seeing \u2018snouts in the dark\u2019 on Malacca Strait, one of the world\u2019s busiest shipping lanes", "authors": ["Kate Lamb"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/367263e8d70001dedb40f7186489818300bd7429/1013_773_3272_1963/master/3272.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=da6975061f9b7ca873d6ab2c7b0f57ca", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
