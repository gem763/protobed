REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo\n\n\u201cThe \u2018stay put\u2019 concept had become an article of faith within the LFB (London Fire Brigade) so powerful that to depart from it was to all intents and purposes unthinkable,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn theory, high-rise buildings are designed to ensure that fire cannot spread from one unit to another. That means it is usually safer for residents to stay in their homes while firefighters tackle a fire, as opposed to running out into dangerous fumes and getting in the way.\n\nBut at Grenfell Tower the fire spread so rapidly that firefighters were never able to bring it under control. It raged through the night until the building was a charred ruin and everyone inside was dead.\n\nMoore-Bick said evidence given to the inquiry by the head of the fire brigade, Dany Cotton, was \u201cremarkably insensitive\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe commissioner\u2019s evidence that she would not change anything about the response of the LFB on the night, even with the benefit of hindsight, only serves to demonstrate that the LFB is an institution at risk of not learning the lessons of the Grenfell Tower fire,\u201d he wrote.\n\nCotton, who has previously announced plans to retire, made no public comment.\n\nA spokeswoman for the London Fire Brigade said it would be inappropriate to comment on the phase one report before its official publication on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cSCAPEGOAT\u201d\n\nMatt Wrack, head of the Fire Brigades Union which represents rank-and-file firefighters, said Cotton should not be made a scapegoat when the Grenfell fire was a result of multiple long-term failings by successive governments.\n\n\u201cMy frustration with this is that individual firefighters including senior officers like Dany Cotton are being subject to a degree of scrutiny which government ministers are avoiding,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4.\n\nWrack said the public inquiry was \u201cback to front\u201d and should have first looked into the deeper causes of the tragedy. He said the building itself had \u201ccompletely failed\u201d and the fire service\u2019s actions should be judged within that context.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Firefighters spray water onto the Grenfell Tower block which was destroyed in a disastrous fire, in north Kensington, West London, Britain June 16, 2017.
