But I do think that, for those weapons of war \u2014 AR-15s, AK-47s \u2014 these were designed and sold to the militaries of the world to kill people on a battlefield and there are more than 16 million of them in America. And we\u2019ve seen the devastating effect that they can have in Dayton, Ohio, or El Paso, Texas, or Odessa, not too far from where I live. Those must be bought back or else each of them are an instrument potentially of terror in this country.\n\nBut Politfact then noted O\u2019Rourke was asked about AR-15s and AK-47s during the September 12, 2019, Democrat debate. His response was clear, \u201cHell, yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.\u201d\n\nMoreover, during a September 18, 2019, appearance on CNN, O\u2019Rourke appeared to his support for confiscation once more.\n\nCNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo asked, \u201cAll right, so let\u2019s state the proposition. Are you, in fact, in favor of gun confiscation?\n\nO\u2019Rourke: \u201cYes, when it comes to AR-15s and AK-47s, weapons designed for use on a military battlefield. \u2026So, when it comes to those weapons, Chris, the answer is yes.\u201d\n\nPolitifact went on to report O\u2019Rourke\u2019s pledge to send law enforcement to visit the non-complaint and \u201crecover\u201d their rifles so the government could buy them. And they spoke to University of Wyoming law expert George Mocsary, who said, \u201cIt is unreasonable to call what Mr. O\u2019Rourke is proposing anything other than confiscation.\u201d\n\nPolitifact reported, \u201cWe rate O\u2019Rourke\u2019s claim that he is \u2018not talking about confiscating anybody\u2019s guns\u2019 as False.\u201d\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.
