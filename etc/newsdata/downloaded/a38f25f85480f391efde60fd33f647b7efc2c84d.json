Stock selling initially accelerated, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average down more than 200 points, after the Fed's policy statement showed officials weren't in agreement about the prospect of further rate cuts in 2019. That may have come as a disappointment to investors who had been widely expecting another interest-rate cut by the end of the year.\n\nBut stocks gradually chipped away at their losses as Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in his postmeeting conference that he felt the U.S. economic outlook remained bright. Bank stocks led the market higher, helping stock indexes end the day well off session lows.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 36.28 points, or 0.1%, to 27147.08. The S&P 500 added 1.03 point, or less than 0.1%, to 3006.73 and the Nasdaq Composite edged down 8.62 points, or 0.1%, to 8177.39.\n\n\"I'm surprised at the extent to which the Fed is divided,\" said David Norris, head of U.S. credit at TwentyFour Asset Management. \"It tells me they're paying attention to the domestic data, but maybe a little bit uncertain about where it's going.\"\n\nRisks like slowing global growth and the prolonged U.S.-China trade fight have taken a toll on many investors' confidence this year. Still, U.S. stocks have held on to double-digit percentage gains, buoyed by a more upbeat view on the domestic economy.\n\nThe KBW Nasdaq Bank Index added 0.6% Wednesday. Shares of lenders tend to pick up when bond yields rise and investors feel more optimistic about the economic outlook.\n\nThose gains helped offset losses among other sectors.\n\nFedEx slid $22.39, or 13%, to $150.91 after cutting its profit forecast for the year late Tuesday and citing a worsening economic backdrop. Shares of competitor United Parcel Service also lost ground, down $1.35, or 1.1%, to $121.04.\n\nTech shares were under pressure most of the day, with Roku diving $20.64, or 14%, to $129.88 after Comcast said it would offer a free streaming device to internet-only customers.\n\nEnergy shares were under pressure as oil prices extended a recent streak of volatility. ConocoPhillips fell $1.21, or 2%, to $60.01.\n\nU.S. crude for October delivery fell 2.1%, to $58.11 a barrel, logging its sixth decline in seven sessions.\n\nThe tick downward came after Saudi Arabia's energy ministry said the kingdom would return to normal oil production levels by the end of the month -- faster than analysts had anticipated.\n\nElsewhere, the Stoxx Europe 600 edged up less than 0.1% after a mixed session in Asia. The Shanghai Composite rose 0.3% and Japan's Nikkei Stock Average slipped 0.2%.\n\nJapan's exports dropped 8.2% on year last month, a more rapid fall than expected, adding to speculation that the central bank may seek to cut interest rates deeper into negative territory.\n\nWrite to Akane Otani at akane.otani@wsj.com and Anna Isaac at anna.isaac@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 18, 2019 16:32 ET (20:32 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
