Kepler watched over 530,000 stars for tiny dips in brightness that could be caused by a planet passing in front of the star \u2014 transits, in other words. Since then, astronomers have discovered over 4,000 exoplanets, and another 4,000-plus candidates are waiting to be confirmed with further observation.\n\nThis data has taught us that Earth-like worlds may not be so rare. In fact, planets between the sizes of Earth and Neptune seem to be the most common type in the galaxy.\n\nOne recent analysis of Kepler data estimated that 20% to 50% of stars have small, possibly rocky planets orbiting in their habitable zones \u2014 the range of distances from a star in which a planet's surface temperature could allow for liquid water. That means there could be up to 10 billion Earth-like planets in our galaxy.\n\nKepler retired last year after the telescope ran out of fuel, but it has passed the planet-hunting torch to the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS).\n\nHere are 16 of the exoplanets we know about so far that have the greatest potential for alien life.", "description": "NASA telescopes have found thousands of exoplanets, some of which could host life.
