James O'Keefe and the folks over at Project Veritas have begun releasing their #ExposeCNN video tapes. Cary Poarch had been working as a contractor for CNN since 2017, but he was disgusted after what he thought was going to be his dream job of helping the media report accurate and unbiased news quickly turned into a \"nightmare.\" He told Sean Hannity on Monday night that he would lose sleep over the stuff he saw occur, particularly on the 9:00 am phone call with CNN president Jeffrey Zucker. Here's a brief re-cap of the first Project Veritas video, but you really should watch it in its entirety:\n\n\"Most of the top hosts hate Trump. CNN president Jeffrey Zucker hates him as well. So, it\u2019s not shocking that the animus leeches into the programming. Zucker is heard on calls, giving marching orders to focus on impeachment and ignore other stories. He rips Fox News for peddling conspiracy theories and pretty much being fake news, which is just rich coming from this network that\u2019s perpetually in third place. Fox is king. They will never beat them. So, chalk up the trash talk as one coming from an executive that will never reach an audience like that at Fox News. Other tidbits come from CNN\u2019s floor manager, who described the aura of death that was in the air when Trump won the 2016 election while admitting that the network is partially to blame for Hillary\u2019s loss with the non-stop coverage. Trump got around $2 billion in free media during the 2016 cycle. Floor Director Hiram Gonzalez is caught telling PV\u2019s insider, \u201cBetween you and I, we created this monster and now we\u2019re eating him full plate every single day. Media created the Trump monster.\u201d Meanwhile, CNN\u2019s media coordinator admits that top hosts at the network, Jake Tapper, Anderson Cooper, Don Lemon, and Chris Cuomo, either hate or strongly dislike the president. Again, no shocker there.\"\n\nHere's the full video:\n\n\n\n\n\nBut, for months now Poarch has been secretly recording every conversation he had within the walls of the network and then some. And if we know anything about Project Veritas, it is that they never reveal their full hand in the first video that they release in their media rollout. They let leftists trip over themselves as they condemn Project Veritas. Then, they release another video showing said leftists to be morons and so on and so forth.\n\nHowever, Poarch is now out of a job. Because of this, O'Keefe and his team have set up a GoFundMe for the whistleblower. What he did was actual investigative journalism. It should be praised. Just as Upton Sinclair exposed how the sausage was made, Veritas and Poarch are exposing how the fake news is made.\n\nAs seen in this video below, Poarch felt compelled to expose CNN. He says he really is not trying to take the network down, he just wants to expose the biases. But, he needs help since he'll likely have a huge target in is back. If you want to help contribute to Poarch, his GoFundMe can be found here.\n\n\"I came there thinking this was my dream job and it very quickly descended into a nightmare that gave me trouble sleeping every night,\" Cary Poarch, the CNN whistleblower said.\n\n\n\n\"It contradicted what I originally thought news should be.\" pic.twitter.com/D7EPuyykfu \u2014 Washington Examiner (@dcexaminer) October 15, 2019\n\nEditor's Note: In the interest of transparency, the author of this piece has a relative who works for Project Veritas.", "description": ".10/15/2019 0:24:05AM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/288/05bf1b23-d897-43d1-95ea-4bb01a93f648.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
