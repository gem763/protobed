In fact, government data cited by Sam Dogen of the Financial Samurai blog shows that some 95% of U.S. households don\u2019t pull in that much. The median household income in the U.S. is $57,782, with places like San Francisco and New York City showing medians income for a family at $96,265 and $79,781, respectively, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nThe thing is, that kind of income, while relatively huge, is barely enough, according to Dogen, for a family to lead a comfortable life in coastal counties \u2014 where almost half of the nation\u2019s population calls home.\n\n\u201cYou can certainly live a middle-class lifestyle earning less, but it won\u2019t be easy if your goal is to raise a family, save for your children\u2019s education, save for your own home and save for retirement (so you can actually retire by a reasonable age),\u201d he wrote in a post published on CNBC on Wednesday.\n\nDogen uses this budget to illustrate his view:\n\nHe said that the numbers have been vetted by thousands of Financial Samurai readers who face raising their families in expensive cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Boston and Washington, D.C.\n\nAs you can see, the annual cash flow ends up being only $1,456, which doesn\u2019t go very far should unexpected expenses pop up. As they do. Along with making for stressful bill paying, this doesn\u2019t bode well for an early exit from the proverbial rat race.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, despite making $350,000 a year, this couple will be unable to retire before 60 because they aren\u2019t building an after-tax investment portfolio to generate passive income,\u201d Dogen wrote. \u201cIn order for this couple to achieve financial independence, they need to accumulate a net worth equal to at least 25 times their annual expenses \u2014 or 20 times their annual gross income.\u201d\n\nDogen says that means the couple has to build up between $5.5 million and $7 million in net worth if their income and expenses remain unchanged.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s tough to do with so little in savings per year,\u201d he said.\n\nDogen says if the goal is to amass wealth and hit the FIRE goal (financial independence, retire early), the couple needs to consider moving to a more affordable area, go to public school, limit vacations, eat at home more often and track it all so they get to understand their situation and their goals.\n\n\u201cWe all deserve to live a middle-class lifestyle,\u201d he wrote on CNBC. \u201cUnfortunately, we\u2019ve first got to sacrifice more than ever to get there today.\u201d", "description": "Most Americans would probably have a hard time wrapping their heads around a $350,000 salary.
