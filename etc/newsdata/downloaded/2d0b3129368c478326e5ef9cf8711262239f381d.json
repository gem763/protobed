In fact, I was the first journalist to break the taboo against using the word menopause, and to explain how it could be a passage of liberation in women\u2019s lives.\n\nThe book exploded the myth that women\u2019s lives are over because they can no longer bear children. It celebrated the fact that 50-plus women have a whole Second Adulthood to start over and draw on their experience, find their passion, and put it to new purpose. I didn\u2019t cry about it and I am unhappy at being depicted as a feminist who did\u2014along with others you named.\n\nThe good news is that today, Millennial women, the oldest of whom are now almost 38, have knowledge of perimenopause\u2014the most symptomatic stage\u2014which I highlighted in The Silent Passage. If they have an understanding of menopause and its effects, and when or whether a brief period of hormone-replacement therapy could be helpful in dealing with the most troubling symptoms, they may make that passage with a more enlightened attitude.", "description": "Gail Sheehy and Liza Mundy discuss the end of fertility\u2014and the diversity of women\u2019s experiences.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/GettyImages_166258811/facebook.jpg?1572033816", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
