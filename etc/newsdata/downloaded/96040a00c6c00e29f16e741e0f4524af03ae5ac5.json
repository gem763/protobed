I can still arrive naked.\u201d\n\nIt may not have been though, as Arnie revealed that he was close to death during his sixth heart operation.\n\nWhile having a 'routine procedure' on the operating table, the situation took a turn for the worse as surgeons looked to tackle a faulty pulmonary valve in his heart.\n\n(Image: WireImage)\n\n(Image: Kerry Brown)\n\nDespite being close to meeting his maker, Arnie was more concerned that he would meet the schedule set down for the filming of the latest instalment in the Terminator franchise - Dark Fate.\n\nIn the movie, Arnie reunites with Linda Hamilton for the first time since they were onscreen together in 1991's Terminator 2: Judgement Day.\n\nWith the latest in the series about to hit the cinemas, Arnie revealed that he was back in the gym just a week after returning home from hospital.\n\n(Image: Startraks Photo/REX)\n\nHe told The Sun: \"It\u2019s no problem. It gets a little bit harder the older you get. The body is not as forgiving as it used to be.\n\n\u201cBut you just have to train more, you have to do more reps. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\u201d\n\nSpeaking about the op in March 2018, which almost proved fatal, Arnie was very relaxed about what could have been.\n\n(Image: WireImage)\n\nHe continued: \"It was kind of a surprise. I never get scared about these things.\n\n\"For a minute I was worried it was too close to doing Terminator 6 but I realised right away the movie is a good means to get back into shape again.\n\n\u201cI was home in no time and was back to the gym in no time. Most people baby themselves too much after surgery.\u201d\n\nWhen he went back into the gym, Arnie had to be careful and had to forgo bench presses.\n\nThis was due to his rib cage being held together by wire but within months, he was back on set filming Dark Fate.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
