Penned in the center of the rally arena behind metal barriers, he assigns us a character as the crowd boos: \u201cFake News,\u201d the heel, or sometimes \u201cThe Enemy of the People!\u201d\n\nHis extravagant blond bouffant, tanned skin and uniform of suit and overlong tie can be fully appreciated in this context.\n\nIt is simultaneously alarming and amusing that the Leader of the Free World is performing like a fictional bad guy, but it needs to be understood, because much of what he says and tweets is only half-serious.\n\nThat\u2019s not because he\u2019s channeling \u201cHitler, Stalin and Mao,\u201d as a CNN guest claimed on Sunday, but because this is how he communicates the great drama of his presidency \u2014 in wrestling allegory, as a spectacle of excess.\n\nLast week was a case in point, when Trump called himself \u201cthe Chosen One\u201d in a sardonic aside during one of the comic \u201cChopper Talk\u201d press conferences on the South Lawn of the White House.\n\nThe \u201cFake News Media\u201d played its role to perfection, ginning up stories about the president\u2019s \u201cMessiah complex,\u201d which allowed him to extend the storyline with weekend tweets from the G-7.\n\n\u201cWhen I looked up to the sky and jokingly said, \u2018I am the chosen one,\u2019 at a press conference two days ago, referring to taking on Trade with China, little did I realize that the media would claim that I had a \u2018Messiah complex,\u2019\u201d he tweeted.\n\nBy yesterday, this most villainous of heels had become \u201cthe Fake and Disgusting News\u201d in Trump\u2019s daily banter blasted out on the @realDonaldTrump Twitter handle.\n\nHis Twitter feed, with its outlandish, self-aggrandizing dramas, is an extension of the WWE theme.\n\nHis tweet about buying Greenland extended into a mock feud with the Danish prime minister.\n\nThe storyline served to distract attention from a plunging Dow, as did Trump\u2019s tweet casting Fed Chairman Jerome Powell as a heel.\n\nFrom a political point of view, Trump\u2019s WWE appropriation makes perfect sense, since the wrestling audience is huge \u2014 800 million households worldwide every week, says WWE \u2014 and its demographic aligns with those of his voters: 60 percent are male, 60 percent are white, and more than 60 percent are not college graduates.\n\nEven his feud with The Mooch, former communications director Anthony Scaramucci, is a WWE storyline. The Mooch is a babyface-turned-heel who appears at Joe Biden events. Trump tweets that he is a \u201chighly unstable nut job.\u201d\n\nIs Trump a good guy or a bad guy?\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a heel to some. He\u2019s a babyface to others,\u201d says \u201cStone Cold\u201d Steve Austin, once the greatest wrestler in WWE history, who now hosts a podcast drawing 2 million downloads and a USA show, \u201cStraight Up Steve Austin.\u201d\n\nTrump seems to have modeled himself on Austin, who was an anti-authoritarian, blue-collar, cussing heel who didn\u2019t care how he was perceived and was so admired by audiences that he \u201cturned face.\u201d\n\nLike Austin, Trump\u2019s persona is champion of the underdog, \u201cthe People\u2019s Billionaire,\u201d the \u201cheel\u201d who picks fights and always prevails.\n\n\u201cThe crowd know it\u2019s fake but they believe, just like if you went to a movie.\u201d\n\nThis is why Trump\u2019s fans let him get away with extravagant untruths that drive his media critics mad.\n\nIt was audiences in Trump\u2019s hometown who turned WWE villains into good guys, says Austin, at Madison Square Garden and the Nassau Coliseum.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a great crowd but they\u2019re tough, especially on babyfaces. Sometimes heels get more cheers,\u201d Austin goes on.\n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s age, people tend to be more entertained by the trash-talking of the heels rather than the good-guy characteristics of the wholesome babyface [who] always plays by the rules.\u201d\n\nThis is where Trump learned his crowd skills, from decades sitting in the front row of Wrestlemania, studying the form of stars like Austin and a wrestler-turned-politician, Jesse \u201cThe Body\u201d Ventura, who became governor of Minnesota.\n\nA friend of WWE owner Vince McMahon, Trump staged two of the first Wrestlemanias in Atlantic City in the late 1980s, was incorporated into storylines and inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame.\n\nAs if to underscore the debt his performance art owes to his old friend, Trump on Sunday tweeted, \u201cHappy Birthday, Vince.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s original catchphrase was \u201cYou\u2019re fired.\u201d Today it\u2019s \u201cMake America great again,\u201d which audiences at his rallies chant along with him.\n\nHis ability to excite the crowd is, in the tweet of \u201cThe Greatest Mayor,\u201d babyface Rudy Giuliani, \u201ca unique and potent political weapon.\u201d\n\nLike the audience, the \u201cFake News Media,\u201d especially the \u201cFailing New York Times,\u201d suspends disbelief and plays the role Trump assigns it because, in the end, it\u2019s good for business.\n\nTrump\u2019s WWE presidency is both a pantomime about justice and a morality play, as Roland Barthes wrote of wrestling in his 1957 essay.\n\nEven Trump\u2019s name is a wrestling trope, since the dictionary definition is to defeat someone publicly.\n\nBut whether his is a \u201ctrumped up\u201d presidency or the real deal, only the voters will decide.\n\nOne dope ruins bus ride for all\n\nThe normalization of marijuana is causing trouble for bus passengers who don\u2019t want to get sick \u2014 or high \u2014 on their way home, according to reader Jim.\n\nHe was on an express bus going over the 59th Street Bridge one recent afternoon when \u201cthe bus started filling up with marijuana smoke.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe female driver pulled the bus over on Northern Boulevard, called dispatch and explained the situation. She then got off the bus along with a few elderly women so as not to inhale the smoke.\u201d\n\nJim and another passenger then asked the pot smoker \u201cto please stop,\u201d but the response was cursing.\n\nAfter more than half an hour of waiting around, the driver took the passengers to another location where they could change buses.\n\nIt took Jim an extra hour to get home.\n\nThis is what comes from pandering to potheads.\n\nBeware of \u2018softer\u2019 CEOs\n\nWhen America\u2019s richest capitalists go woke, beware.\n\nJP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon, best known for helping spark a financial crisis and then profiting from it, has joined with almost 200 CEOs of big American companies to issue a letter promising a new, softer capitalism with an emphasis on social responsibility.\n\n\u201cWhile each of our individual companies serves its own corporate purpose, we share a fundamental commitment to all of our stakeholders \u2026 We commit to deliver value to all of them, for the future success of our companies, our communities and our country.\u201d\n\nReally, they should stick to making money. Social engineering attempts by unelected, unaccountable elites always end badly, not least by making their companies go broke.", "description": "When you attend one of his rallies, as I did last week in New Hampshire, it is obvious that Donald Trump has modeled his presidential persona on WWE pro-wrestling.", "authors": ["Miranda Devine", "August"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/donald-trump-13.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200"}
