But if you plan to travel internationally, you should look past the rewards and make sure you\u2019re getting an increasingly common card benefit: zero foreign transaction fees.\n\nWhen you use your debit or credit card in another country, your bank must convert that charge to AU dollars so it can withdraw the money from your account. Fees for this can range between one and three per cent.\n\nThat may not seem like a lot, but there\u2019s an added benefit of using a card that doesn\u2019t charge this small fee: You can also avoid the latest traveller scam.\n\nVindu Goel tells his story in the New York Times: While eating at a popular tourist attraction in India, the server added 5% to the bill, then presented the receipt in dollars instead of Indian rupees. The server didn\u2019t ask for his permission to do so, which Goel points out is required by Visa and Mastercard. The move is called dynamic currency conversion. \u201cForeign merchants add a stiff markup to your bill, convert it to your home currency, then claim it benefits you,\u201d Goel explained.\n\nIt\u2019s not just tourist attractions who pull this manoeuvre. Goel, who travels internationally frequently, said he\u2019s seen it everywhere from neighbourhood drugstores to big hotel chains. Sometimes you\u2019ll be given choice on the card machine to pay in the local currency or your home one.\n\nHere\u2019s where the zero-transaction fee card comes in handy. If you have one, you can always choose \u2014 or demand, if need be \u2014 that the purchase be rung in local currency. If you have an American Express card, you don\u2019t have to worry about this as it doesn\u2019t allow dynamic currency conversion.\n\nThen, Goel says, you should double-check your receipt to make sure the business didn\u2019t switch the currency without your consent. \u201cThe giveaway that you\u2019ve been hit is when the charge slip lists an amount in your home currency with microscopic print that claims you gave consent,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIf you discover this and the merchant won\u2019t void the purchase and re-ring it, Goel says to dispute the charge.\n\nHere are some Australian options that come with zero foreign transaction fees.
