There won\u2019t, and cannot be, a government that relies on anti-Zionist Arab parties that deny the very existence of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state,\u201d the prime minister said pulling out his one final card: fear of the left.\n\nBut it fell flat against the echoing walls and platters of uneaten sandwiches: the wizard of diplomacy and elections had finally run out of spells.\n\nDahlia Scheindlin, a prominent pollster who has worked on seven elections campaign, said that while the final results were still unknown, the \u201cone thing that is certain: it is not a win for Netanyahu\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn his speech he doesn\u2019t seem to realise the campaign over,\u201d she continued.\u201d He doesn\u2019t seem to realise people voted already. He is not going to improve his bargaining position.\u201d\n\nMr Netanyahu had sought a clear victory with his right-wing partners to secure immunity from three expected corruption trials.\n\nThe only way for him to form that right-wing immunity government would be to try to tempt Mr Lieberman, whose party Yisrael Beiteinu secured nine seats, to rejoin the fold.\n\nBut Scheindlin pointed out that would mean offering mind-boggling concessions given Mr Lieberman has already announced he would only back a unity government with Blue and White.\n\nOtherwise, Mr Netanyahu would have to consent to an alliance with Blue and White who have said they would join forces with Likud but not if Netanyahu is in power.\n\nThe options for staying in power remain extremely limited.\n\nAnd so Anshel Pfeffer, an expert on the prime minister, who wrote biography The Turbulent Life and Times of Benjamin Netanyahu, said that for first time in a decade it appeared that there might be a new era post Netanyahu. If so it would spark a paradigm shift in Israeli politics.\n\nNetanyahu is the longest-serving premier in Israel\u2019s history, having been in office since 2009, surpassing in July even the country\u2019s founding father Ben Gurion.\n\n\u201cThe feeling that he can do whatever he wants, that he is a magician and all-powerful disappeared last night,\u201d Pfeffer told The Independent.\n\n\u201cIsraeli politics have been built around Netanyahu. The Likud will no longer be the same party. The whole Right will have to reinvent itself,\u201d he said.\n\nEven the centre and left would have to find a new identity after sculpting their position as one entirely determined by their opposition to Netanyahu, he continued.\n\n\u201cIsraeli politics has been defined not by ideology but by how much parties love or hate Netanyahu.\u201d\n\nSo what next if he is pushed from power?\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
