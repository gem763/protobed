I honestly didn't think it could get any worse. I. Was. Wrong.\u201d\n\nNot only did it take the poor first-time mum four days to give birth \u2013 but her mother-in-law made her an even more torturous time.\n\n\u201cWhen we got to the hospital I was already 8cm and was rushed in and rushed to get hooked to the medical devices, my MIL came in two hours later,\u201d she explained.\n\n\u201cEverything seemed fine and calm until MIL wanted a cigarette and started to demand I start to push, then she tried to threaten that if I didn't start pushing, she will have to push down on my stomach to force my daughter out.\u201d\n\nWant to join the family?

So she left for 40 minutes.\n\nHowever, getting some fresh air didn\u2019t knock any sense into the shameless woman.\n\n\u201cI went into labour and I was in the middle of pushing when she ran in, this being my first child and being in labour for so long with no pain meds or rest or food/water I was drained. Pushing was hard as hell and I just wanted to sleep!\u201d she vividly remembers.\n\nBut her MIL put a stop to any form of relaxation.\n\n\u201cWell the moment my daughter was born was the moment I noticed that the entire labour MIL had her phone out and was recording my ENTIRE birth! From my pushing too the stitching process (I tore 100 per cent),\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI asked my MIL to delete the video, and she promised she did.\u201d\n\nA week later, visiting the MIL revealed all...\n\nIt seems her MIL has no problems with not only breaking her promises but also lying to her daughter-in-law\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cIt wasn't until a week later when we went to visit her (she had an \u2018emergency\u2019) that I found she was showing random strangers this video and many of these strangers were men that she barely knew.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, it wasn\u2019t just a case of Beth insisting (once again) that her MIL delete the private footage.\n\nInstead, it turned into a dirty legal battle.\n\n\u201cIt took going to court to get the video deleted and after that she wasn't allowed near me nor my daughter.\u201d\n\nAnd shockingly, there is a sequel to the MIL birth drama on the way\u2026\n\n\u201cThis isn't the only thing she's done. There's a whole other labour story of when I had my son and how bad she messed up.\u201d\n\n*Name changed", "description": "\u201cI asked her to delete the video - and she promised she had.\u201d", "authors": ["Leesa Smith"], "top_image": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/9ad47be35c68a90d0e679c538e620b2a", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
