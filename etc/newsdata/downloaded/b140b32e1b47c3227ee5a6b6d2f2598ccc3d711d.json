He made some very big mistakes,\u201d Trump said, repeatedly referencing Bolton\u2019s invocation of a \u201cLibya model\u201d for North Korean denuclearization in April 2018.\n\n\u201cIt set us back, and frankly, he wanted to do things not necessarily tougher than me,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou know, John\u2019s known as a tough guy. He's so tough, he got us into Iraq. That\u2019s tough.\u201d\n\nTrump again claimed later in his remarks that it was he, not Bolton, who at times advocated for a more muscular foreign policy approach, despite Bolton\u2019s perceived proclivity for military intervention and championing of the 2003 invasion of Iraq from within former President George W. Bush's administration.\n\n\u201cYou know, John wasn't in line with what we were doing, and actually, in some cases, he thought it was too tough what we were doing,\u201d Trump said. \u201c\u2018Mr. Tough Guy.\u2019 You know, \u2018You have to go into Iraq.\u2019 Going into Iraq was something that he felt very strongly about.\u201d\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/3857/1155968404_6085050604001_6085042811001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nTrump caught much of Washington and seemingly some senior members of his administration off guard on Tuesday when he tweeted the news of Bolton\u2019s exit.\n\n\u201cI informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House,\u201d the president wrote online. \u201cI disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration, and therefore \u2026 I asked John for his resignation, which was given to me this morning.\u201d\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham on Tuesday backed up the her boss' story, saying that Bolton and Trump met in the Oval Office on Monday night before the president left for a rally in North Carolina. It was then that Trump asked for Bolton's resignation, she said.\n\nBut Bolton offered a different account in his own tweet posted shortly after Trump\u2019s messages on Tuesday: \u201cI offered to resign last night and President Trump said, \u2018Let's talk about it tomorrow.\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump stuck to his version of events on Wednesday, recounting that \u201cJohn came to see me the night before\u201d his ouster and pointing to the chair in the Oval Office where Bolton allegedly sat.\n\n\u201cI told him, \u2018John, you have too many people \u2014 you\u2019re not getting along with people, and a lot of us, including me, disagree with some of your tactics and some of your ideas. And I wish you well, but I\u2019d like you to submit your resignation,\u2019\u201d Trump said.\n\nBolton\u2019s departure followed reports that he had been largely sidelined from White House deliberations aimed at ending the war in Afghanistan, and had objected to a planned round of peace talks at Camp David with leaders of the Afghan Taliban.\n\nTrump announced on Twitter over the weekend that he had canceled those secret negotiations following an attack by the Islamist militia in Kabul that killed an American soldier.\n\n\u201cThat was my decision, and what we\u2019re doing now is my decision. So we have a lot of great people who want that position,\u201d Trump said Wednesday in reference to Bolton\u2019s role, which \u2014 like the positions of Homeland Security secretary, national intelligence director and White House chief of staff \u2014 will be filled by an acting official.\n\n\u201cI have five people that want it very much. I mean, a lot more than that would like to have it,\u201d Trump said of the candidates to become his administration\u2019s fourth national security adviser. \u201cBut there are five people that I consider very highly qualified, good people I've gotten to know over the last three years, and we\u2019ll be announcing somebody next week.\u201d", "description": "The president alternated between vicious criticism of his former aide and an insistence that they had maintained a warm working relationship.", "authors": ["Quint Forgey"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/37/8c/6670cd244bd28166e13a86fe0812/20190911-donald-trump-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
