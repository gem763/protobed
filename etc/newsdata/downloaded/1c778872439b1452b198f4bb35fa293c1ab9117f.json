But, in the process, they\u2019re overestimating voters\u2019 support \u2013 and underestimating the two million lives saved by the Hyde Amendment.\n\nSeptember 30 marked the 42nd anniversary of the Hyde Amendment. The legislative provision, which is approved annually by Congress, bars federal dollars from directly funding abortion. There are a few exceptions: cases of rape, incest, and saving the life of the mother. But that wasn\u2019t enough for the Democratic presidential candidates who took to Twitter to condemn the provision.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts tweeted that it was \u201ctime for Hyde to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cI've lived in an America where abortions were illegal,\u201d she warned. \u201cWomen still got abortions\u2014but they were dangerous and too often deadly.\u201d\n\nThe provision was first passed in 1976, three years after the Supreme Court\u2019s Roe v. Wade decision legalized abortion nationwide.\n\nWarren worried that the provision \u201charms the most vulnerable women by limiting their ability to safely access abortion.\u201d\n\nFor her part, Senator Kamala Harris of California remembered \u201cthe anniversary of a dark day in our nation\u2019s history.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccess to reproductive health care should not be based on how much money people have,\u201d she typed. \u201cWe must repeal the Hyde Amendment.\u201d\n\nLike Harris, many of the other candidates accused the Hyde Amendment of targeting Americans with lower incomes. To them, the provision wasn\u2019t about protecting Americans\u2019 consciences.\n\nOn social media, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont shared a NARAL Pro-Choice America tweet calling for the repeal of the Hyde Amendment.\n\n\u201cIf we believe in the constitutional right to abortion, we must ensure all women have that right regardless of income,\u201d Sanders argued. \u201cMedicare for All will cover all reproductive health services, including abortion, and eliminate the Hyde Amendment.\u201d\n\nFrom New Jersey, Senator Cory Booker tweeted a video of himself attacking the provision at an event.\n\n\u201c43 years ago, the House passed the Hyde Amendment for the first time, denying federal Medicaid coverage of abortion to millions\u2014many of them low-income and people of color,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs president, I will fight to end the assault on reproductive health.\u201d\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro also chimed in with a personal note.\n\n\u201cThe first woman to die because of the Hyde Amendment was named Rosie, just like my mom,\u201d he wrote of a woman who died after obtaining an unsafe illegal abortion. \u201cThe Hyde Amendment has hurt too many.\u201d\n\nCongressman Tim Ryan of Ohio also recognized the anniversary, declaring, \u201cit\u2019s time to be BOLD and lift abortion coverage bans once and for all.\u201d\n\nBut Democrats may be miscalculating how many Americans support funding abortion \u2013 or forcing others to fund it. In June, Slate published a piece with the headline \u201cAbortion Funding Isn\u2019t As Popular As Democrats Think.\u201d\n\n\u201c[I]t\u2019s not true that opposition to the Hyde Amendment has become broadly popular or a consensus position among Democrats,\u201d staff writer William Saletan wrote, before citing polls from Politico/Morning Consult, PRRI, Marist, Politico/Harvard, and YouGov.\n\n\u201cIn every poll, a plurality of Americans opposes public funding of abortions,\u201d he stressed, and \u201cIn every poll but one, that plurality is a majority.\u201d\n\nVoicing the pro-life movement on Twitter, Lila Rose, the president and founder of Live Action, applauded the Hyde Amendment on its anniversary. She also pointed out that the provision is \u201csupported by the majority of Americans.\u201d\n\nBesides preventing tax dollars from directly funding abortions, the Hyde Amendment, which was originally bipartisan, has been passed annually for 43 years, she wrote. But the provision\u2019s most important contribution is the number of human persons alive today because of its existence. According to Rose, the Hyde Amendment \u201cSaves 60,000 children yearly\u201d and \u201cHas saved 2 million children\u201d total.\n\nThe Charlotte Lozier Institute, the research arm of the Susan B. Anthony List, confirms those numbers. According to associate scholar Michael New, \u201cThe Hyde Amendment routinely saves more than 60,000 lives in the United States every year.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince 1976, the best research indicates that the Hyde Amendment has saved over 2 million unborn children,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAbortion supporters know the Hyde Amendment makes a difference. But the pro-life movement counts two million of them.", "description": "Several 2020 Democrats are renewing their calls for taxpayer-funded abortion. .10/01/2019 11:22:24AM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Yoder", "Cortney O'Brien", "Leah Barkoukis", "Timothy Meads", "Julio Rosas"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/212/69b8b4c5-96e8-4c78-bf49-0d60c9eedf42.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
