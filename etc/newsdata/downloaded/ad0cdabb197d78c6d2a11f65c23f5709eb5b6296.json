The agency will not release companies' data, butsays it will share the data publicly, a move first reported by Bloomberg\n\nThe decision comes as workers in many industries have gotten louder in their calls for increased equity and transparency around the gaps in pay between men, women and people of various racial and ethnic backgrounds. The issue is especially pertinent in the technology industry, which has long been dominated and led by white men.\n\n\"To see real change across the industry we need to start somewhere,\" the company said in a statement. \"With the requirement to report pay data, the EEOC is emphasizing the need for change in the industry, and that is [a] great first step in the right direction.\"\n\nThe new EEOC rule requires companies to provide federal regulators with the pay and hours worked for the median employee \u2014 both full- and part-time \u2014 in a variety of positions, disaggregated by gender, race and ethnicity.
