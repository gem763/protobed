She brushed aside European concerns that her requests amounted to \"cherry picking,\" listing off unique details from some of the the EU's other trade agreements, like with South Korea and Ukraine:\n\n\"The fact is that every free trade agreement has varying market access depending on the respective interests of the countries involved. If this is cherry picking, then every trade arrangement is cherry picking.\"\n\nOne big concession: May acknowledged that the U.K. might attempt to negotiate associate membership with some key EU regulators \u2014 like in the medicine and aviation industries \u2014 so that there would be only one approval process for important goods across Europe. She also floated that this plan would allow U.K.-based experts to provide key technical expertise to the EU.\n\nThe problem: EU representatives still assert that May is indeed \"cherry picking\" which parts of EU membership she does and doesn't want for the U.K., which might signal trouble in the trade negotiations to come, per The Guardian:\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk: \u201cFrom the very start it has been a set principle of the EU27 that there cannot be any cherrypicking of single market \u00e0 la carte. This will continue to be a key principle, I have no doubt.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom the very start it has been a set principle of the EU27 that there cannot be any cherrypicking of single market \u00e0 la carte. This will continue to be a key principle, I have no doubt.\u201d Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: \u201cIt is not possible for the U.K. to be aligned to the EU when it suits and not when it doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not possible for the U.K. to be aligned to the EU when it suits and not when it doesn\u2019t.\u201d Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte: \"For example, membership of the internal market, that means certain obligations. Membership of the customs union, that means certain obligations.\"\n\nMay's five foundations for any trade deal with the EU:\n\nReciprocal binding commitments An independent arbitration mechanism Open, ongoing dialogue with the EU and the ability to consult on regulatory issues Strong arrangements for data protection The maintenance of links between people in the U.K. and the EU\n\nA hot tweet among British political journalists:", "description": "Her Brexit message to the EU: \"Let's get on with it\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/ixsUulzpWAaswwz8G8i7xBT1XxA=/0x135:3402x2049/1920x1080/2018/03/02/1520003930521.jpg", "published_at": "2018-03-02"}
