What I have a problem with is when they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about and they end up defending tyrants.\u201d\n\nWatch:\n\nAs TMZ Sports reports:\n\n\u2018I would encourage LeBron to learn a little bit about the people of Tibet, learn a little bit about Falun Gong the religious persecution and the torture and the horrific human rights abuses that occur in China.\n\n\u2018Now, that doesn\u2019t mean we should never do business with China,\u2019 Cruz says \u2026 \u2018but we don\u2019t need to adopt their values. We don\u2019t need to embrace censorship and propaganda, and sadly that\u2019s what the Chinese government wants the NBA to do.\u2019 When asked if he had advice for LeBron, Cruz said he\u2019d tell LeBron what he\u2019d tell any U.S. citizen.\n\n\u2018If you want to engage on an issue, actually engage on the substance and know what you\u2019re talking about and defend basic principles \u2014 freedom is good, democracy is good, human rights are good. And, those principles are eternal and you shouldn\u2019t be willing to sell out freedom because you want to make a few bucks on sneaker sales.\u2019\n\nJames continues to deal with the fallout from his comments on Monday. On Tuesday, the Lakers forward said he\u2019s \u201cnot a politician,\u201d and will not be discussing the NBA-China rift again.\n\nFollow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn", "description": "U.S. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) accused LeBron James of \"kissing up to tyrants and murderers,\" after the NBA star cited the \"negative\"", "authors": ["Dylan Gwinn"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Ted-Cruz-2-640x480-r-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
