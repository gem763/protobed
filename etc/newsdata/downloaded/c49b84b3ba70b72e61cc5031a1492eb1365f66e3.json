[Photo/IC]\n\nAs one of the few truly mobile-first economies, China is getting more mature in mobile development by creating huge business value for companies both at home and abroad, according to an industry insider.\n\n\"The level of maturity of the country's mobile market has been improved greatly. Though benefits brought by the population are now gone, individual economic value has continued to go up,\" said Paul Muller, chief technology officer of Adjust, a leading mobile measurement and fraud prevention company.\n\nBefore, almost everyone in China had a mobile device. Now, they are willing to pay for goods and services through that device, which opens up huge economic opportunities, Muller noted.\n\nThe number of China's mobile internet users reached 820 million in 2018, up 9 percent year-on-year, the annual report of Mary Meeker, a partner at venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins, said.\n\nThe data flow of China's mobile internet surged 189 percent last year compared with the same period in the previous year, with the growth rate accelerating year after year, the report said.\n\n\"China has the next step ahead of it, which is to create much higher value per individual user. And the number of more affluent users is becoming bigger,\" Muller added.\n\nWhen it comes to innovation in the mobile market, Muller said that China is also a driving force, with the biggest mobile user base across the world, larger than that of North America and Europe combined.\n\nSuch progress has prompted a group of foreign companies like Adjust to beef up their presence in the market for new engines of growth.\n\n\"China opens tremendous opportunities for us. It has become one of our fastest growing markets globally,\" Muller said.\n\n\"The upcoming Singles Day shopping gala, for instance, is an example. Years before, foreign companies didn't realize the purchasing power of such a festival, which outruns even that of Black Friday in Western economies,\" he said.\n\nThe latest data showed that this year's shopping gala, spearheaded by Alibaba Group, is expected to draw 100 million new shoppers to splurge via their mobile devices.\n\nTo tap into the demand, Adjust has been preparing in advance to help its clients get ready to handle the enormous traffic.\n\nAdjust was founded in 2012. It offers mobile app marketers analytics, measurement and fraud prevention solutions. Its partnerships include major online platforms such as Facebook, Google, Twitter and WeChat.\n\nThe Berlin, Germany-based company has grown its team in China to meet increasing demand here and plans to double it again in the next couple of months.", "description": "As one of the few truly mobile-first economies, China is getting more mature in mobile development by creating huge business value for companies both at home and abroad, according to an industry insider.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/25/5db26668a310cf3e97a2efd1.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
