McCollum, Bradley Beal, and more.\n\nRead more: The NBA's best players are dropping out of the first Olympics qualifying event at an alarming rate\n\nAn already-thin roster relying on veterans and young players was stretched further with injuries to Jayson Tatum and Kyle Kuzma, two of the more promising young players on the team.\n\nTo counter France's size, first-time USA head coach Gregg Popovich went small. He used reigning Defensive Player of the Year Gobert in the middle and played lineups featuring players like the 6-foot-7 Jaylen Brown and 6-foot-8 Harrison Barnes at center to spread the floor. The U.S. often struggled on the boards and had no rim protection as a result. When they were beaten on the perimeter \u2014 which didn't often happen, thanks to quick, lengthy lineups \u2014 the U.S. was often toast.\n\nGregg Popovich lost early in first tournament as coach of USA Basketball. Ng Han Guan/AP On the other end, France's perimeter players and Gobert stifled the U.S. offense down the stretch. Mitchell, strangely, was less involved in the final quarter, while Kemba Walker, perhaps the face of the team, struggled with an off-shooting night. Walker had a chance to cut France's lead to three with 42 seconds remaining, but missed two of three free throws, essentially ending the U.S. bid.\n\nNow, however, Team USA doesn't simply get to go home. They are now entered into the third-place bracket, set to face Serbia, a team who many thought could beat the U.S. before they lost a stunning upset to Argentina. The U.S. not only gets a tough Serbia team, with no chance at winning gold, but they must also compete in the \"losers'\" bracket. If they fall to Serbia, they'll play for 7th place.\n\nPerhaps one silver lining of the loss is it could rejuvenate top stars to take place in international competition, particularly in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.", "description": "USA Basketball saw a 58-game international winning streak with NBA players come to a close with a shocking loss to France in the 2019 FIBA World Cup.", "authors": ["Scott Davis"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d78f4af2e22af2713282528-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
