However, it seems likely that Russia will broker a broader agreement to avoid a clash between Turkey and the Assad regime.\n\nIt is not clear if Turkish forces and their Syrian rebel allies will continue advancing into Syria now that Assad's soldiers have entered the area.\n\nThe Pentagon said on Sunday that it was withdrawing all 1,000 American forces from northern Syria. But US media reported the Trump administration was preparing to pull its troops out of the country entirely, with the exception of small garrison in the southern town of al-Tanf to deter Iran.", "description": "Bashar al-Assad\u2019s forces began entering northeast Syria in large numbers for the first time in years on Monday after the West\u2019s Kurdish allies agreed to a Russian-brokered deal to try to hold off a Turkish onslaught.", "authors": ["Raf Sanchez"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ItCuh8XPg3BxdhLv4IfZ8A--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/a1b7ef37fd3397ff8492847a414450ff", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
