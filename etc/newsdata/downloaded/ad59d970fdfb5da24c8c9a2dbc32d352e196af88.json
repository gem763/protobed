House Democrats subpoenaed Sondland last week after the State Department blocked him from appearing before a trio of congressional committees to answer questions about his role in pushing Ukraine's president to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. President Donald Trump defended the decision to prevent Sondland's testimony, saying the Democrats' inquiry is illegitimate. Rep. Adam Schiff, who leads the House Intelligence Committee, said the administration's move to block Sondland's testimony, as well as withhold relevant documents, is \"strong evidence of obstruction\" of justice.\n\nA diagram of events in the impeachment inquiry of President Trump\n\nCLOSE Trump and impeachment: Can President Trump block witnesses and subpoenas, and what can Congress do about it?

But a growing number of cities, states and universities this year are replacing Columbus Day, which is widely controversial because of Columbus' treatment of indigenous people. At least eight states, 10 universities and more than 130 cities across 34 states now observe Indigenous Peoples Day as an alternative to the federally recognized holiday. Yet not everyone's on board. In May, a northern New Jersey town shut down a proposal to change the name. Many Italian-American heritage groups opposed the change, saying it was motivated by \"propaganda.\"\n\nColumbus Day and Indigenous Peoples Day: What's open and closed?\n\nNational League Championship Series goes to Washington\n\nThe National League Championship Series is headed to our nation's capital for the first time in Major League Baseball history on Monday.
