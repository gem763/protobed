Green will remain sidelined for this week's game while continuing to recover from ankle surgery, head coach Zac Taylor said Monday.\n\nTaylor told reporters Green will not practice leading up to Sunday, when the Bengals (0-5) visit the Baltimore Ravens (3-2).\n\nGreen, in his ninth season, has been out since injuring ligaments in his right ankle during the first practice of the preseason.\n\nWhile saying Green will not take snaps against the defense this week, Taylor added he hoped the receiver will begin going through individual drills as he prepares to return.\n\n\"You don't just go into practice full-blown on your first day after being off for two months,\" Taylor said. \"There will come a time where we start working him into individual work and then ease him into practice.\"\n\nGreen was ineligible to be placed on the team's physically unable to perform (PUP) list because he participated in drills before sustaining the injury. The PUP would have allowed Cincinnati to keep a spot for him on the 53-man roster while the player missed a minimum of six weeks.\n\nThe Bengals chose not to place Green on injured reserve before the season. Taylor said the team expected Green to return within the season's first eight weeks, the minimum absence for an IR stint.\n\nGreen, in the final year of his contract, has missed 18 games over the past four seasons with various injuries. He worked with the team's training staff last week while continuing the rehab process.\n\n\"I watch him every day on the rehab field so I see him doing some good things,\" said Taylor, who added Green had not suffered a setback.\n\nThe earliest Green will return is against Jacksonville on Oct. 20. After that, Cincinnati will play the Los Angeles Rams in London before a bye in Week 9.\n\nThe 31-year-old Green has collected 602 receptions for 8,907 yards and 63 touchdowns in 111 games since the Bengals selected him fourth overall in the 2011 NFL Draft.\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver A.J.
