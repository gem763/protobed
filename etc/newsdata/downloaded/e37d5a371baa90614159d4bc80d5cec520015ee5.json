(Ramon Espinosa/AP)\n\nJuliette Kayyem is a former assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security and faculty chair of the homeland security program at Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School of Government.\n\nAmong the relief workers who cycle in and out of the Bahamas in the aftermath of Hurricane Dorian, an unofficial refrain sums up the situation: You can smell more bodies than you can find.\n\nThe government death toll remains, officially, at 58 , but nobody here in Nassau believes it. The conventional wisdom among locals holds that hundreds of the 1,300 still reported missing were swept out to sea, but as the massive debris removal gets underway, the smell implies a different story. On the devastated islands of Abaco and Grand Bahama, souls are being found: There are still \u201cquite a bit of bodies,\u201d said Abaco\u2019s Marsh Harbour coroner, Anon McIntosh.\n\nFor nearly 24 hours, Dorian\u2019s 200 mph winds sat on top of Abaco and its 17,000 residents, ripping everything apart and drowning whole areas before moving slowly on to Grand Bahama. More than 10,000 evacuees from Abaco alone are thought to be in Nassau. They talk of bodies they saw, families entirely lost.\n\nBut it isn\u2019t only the uncounted dead that the Bahamian government is worried about, as criticism of its slow response to the Sept. 1-2 disaster begins to pivot to frustration. For the richest country in the Caribbean to remain so, it must present a different vision of recovery, one that tells the outside world that it is open for business. \u201c14 islands of the Bahamas are ready and waiting to receive you,\u201d a tourist office tweets, ignoring the other devastated two. Massive cruise ships are again lined up in Nassau\u2019s untouched harbor, monstrosities of grandeur looming over the overcrowded evacuation shelters in their shadow.\n\nThere is no shame in these opposing narratives; both are true. For any recovery to begin, the dead must be accounted for and treated with respect. But recovery for the Bahamas is dependent on a steady stream of visitors; after all, 60 percent of its economy is related to tourism.\n\nAt the same time, Dorian has made this Caribbean nation the newest evidence of our changing climate and sea-level rise: Disasters are changing, and how we deal with them must change as well.\n\nFor much of the 20th century, emergency response was based on the notion that natural disasters were random and rare. Yes, bad things happened, but with a surge of resources and commitment, a damaged community could quickly get back to where it was.\n\nBut storms like Dorian are no longer random and rare \u2014 and they are stronger and more violent. \u201cIt is a template hurricane,\u201d Bahamian meteorologist Wayne Neely said. \u201cIt\u2019s the new normal.\u201d Which raises this question: Why invest in recovery that builds communities back when the next storm is always coming, maybe harsher than the last? The simple question in Abaco is whether to rebuild at all.\n\nThe government here has not decided how to answer. It has placed a moratorium on some rebuilding on Abaco so that recovery efforts can be fully planned before everyone just starts doing the same thing again. Meanwhile, people from Abaco don\u2019t know whether they are temporary storm evacuees or permanent climate-change refugees.\n\nAt the Kendal Isaacs Gymnasium in Nassau, 700 of these evacuees are on a single floor, with crammed mattresses and babies crying, mothers trying to look respectable for Sunday services, men playing cards. The government does not allow cameras inside, saying that it is for the evacuees\u2019 privacy. The evacuees, almost all of them of Haitian descent, whisper from their beds that it is because officials don\u2019t want the images coming out. \u201cHome is home,\u201d said Shella Monestime, whose baby was born a day before Dorian hit and who expects to return to Abaco, although her physical home is gone. \u201cThis,\u201d she noted, pointing to the shelter, \u201cis no place for anyone.\u201d\n\nStorms impact communities as they find them. Hurricane Katrina did not create corruption in New Orleans city management. Hurricane Maria did not create a crumbling infrastructure in Puerto Rico. And Hurricane Dorian did not create an ethnic divide between Bahamians and Haitians, who came to Abaco for jobs and remain stigmatized in a country that barely affords them citizenship, let alone political participation. They have no say in the future of their island.\n\nThe scene on Grand Bahama is not as grim. That island also took a direct hit from Dorian, but people are returning to rebuild. The government has asked various relief services to remain for now, said Scott Lillibridge, who runs the medical disaster units for the International Medical Corps. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how long we will be here, but we aren\u2019t leaving soon,\u201d he said.\n\nOne major storm, neither random nor rare, has left many missions in its wake: the cleanup; whether, and how, to build again; the future of Haitian immigrants, who fear the government will simply send them back to Haiti; and luring vacationers to keep the desperately needed money flowing.\n\nBut first the bodies must be found and identified, so their families can pay respects. Maybe they\u2019ve been swept away to the ocean.
