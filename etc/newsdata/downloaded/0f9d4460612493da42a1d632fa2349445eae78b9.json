The service was a roaring success because it avoided many of the frustrations of conventional taxis, but the taxi lobby fought back viciously and got the government on side.\n\nTaxi drivers in Seoul filed a complaint against TADA in February of this year. Everything now depends on how a judge chooses to interpret exceptions in the relevant law, which has not caught up with changing business models and makes it illegal for individuals without taxi licenses to transport passengers for money.\n\nAn exception allows vans with 11 to 15 seats to be rented for chauffeured services, and this is what TADA took advantage of.\n\nBut the conventional taxi industry claims that TADA is exploiting a loophole and is no different to illegal chauffeur services using private passenger cars, and prosecutors share that view.", "description": "TADA Bosses Indicted for Illegal Cab Services", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/29/2019102901147_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
