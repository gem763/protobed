The driver who submitted this video is one of those people,' one person said.\n\nMotorists claimed the man behind the wheel of the red car was actually in the wrong and blamed him for causing the collision, which saw the Mitsubishi's tire fly off\n\n'You're at fault mate, the driver of the blue Mitsubishi is not being aggressive either. You f**ked up.'\n\n'Dashcam driver completely failed to give way, failed to merge safely according to NSW road rules, then proceeded to ram the driver, then uploads the video and tries to lie about it, what an absolute unit,' said another.\n\n'Sorry bud, you need to wait like everyone else. Just because you had your indicator on doesn't entitle you to a lane someone else is occupying.'\n\nAnother motorist pointed out that the driver of the Mitsubishi wasn't required to give way as the right-hand lane wasn't coming to an end.\n\n'Ahaha good luck trying to win that case with your insurance company. She did not have to stop for you as you were changing lanes not merging,' the comment read.", "description": "A driver posted a video of an 'aggressive' woman not letting him cut into a lane, only to be slammed by other road users who say he was actually in the wrong.", "authors": ["Alana Mazzoni For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/02/20264396-0-image-a-17_1572230003482.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
