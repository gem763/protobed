It\u2019s horrible for us and terribly addictive.\n\nAccording to Dr. Josh Axe, a certified doctor of natural medicine and a clinical nutritionist, adults in America consume about 22 teaspoons of added sugar daily. That\u2019s more than double the recommended amount for men and triple the recommended amount for women. Eating a diet high in added sugars can lead to health issues, including decreased cognitive function, increased risk of heart diseases, leaky gut, fatty liver disease, metabolic diseases and even an increased risk of early death.\n\nIf you\u2019ve got a sweet tooth, this might sound scary. But don\u2019t fret. You can eliminate unhealthy sugars from your daily diet without giving up sweetness altogether. There are plenty of natural ways to sweeten your food without the use of refined and processed sugars.\n\nHere are our three favorite options.\n\nMore: How to make coffee even better for your brain & body\n\nHONEY\n\nRaw honey is a wonderful alternative to sugar. Not only is it naturally sweet and delicious, it also boasts antimicrobial, antifungal and antibacterial properties. It\u2019s lovely drizzled onto a morning cup of oatmeal or yogurt, or spooned into tea. If you\u2019re baking with honey and looking to substitute it for the typical refined sugars you\u2019re used to baking with, it may take some finagling. Do your research on conversions or find a recipe that uses honey.\n\nMAPLE SYRUP\n\nThis naturally sweet topping isn\u2019t just for pancakes! And we\u2019re talking about all-natural maple syrup, not the processed fake kinds. Unlike refined sugars, pure maple syrup contains an array of minerals and polyphenols that are good for your body. Like honey, though, if you\u2019re baking with maple syrup, it isn\u2019t a one-to-one swap. Use about three-quarters of a cup of maple syrup for every cup of sugar, and reduce the liquids in the recipe by three tablespoons.\n\nMore: Our healthier, low-carb Twinkie recipe is a dessert lovers dream\n\nSTEVIA\n\nStevia is a sugar substitute derived from the leaves of the stevia plant. It\u2019s free of calories and won\u2019t spike your blood sugar. It tastes super sweet, though, so you can use a lot less stevia to sweeten your food or coffee than you would traditional sugar. You\u2019ll want to be sure to read the labels of any stevia products before purchasing, as many conventional brands contain additives. It\u2019s best to select a brand that is entirely made up of stevia or stevia and water. Each brand has its own recommended ratio when swapping stevia for sugar, so pay attention to that as well.\n\nWant to learn how to decorate that healthier cake?
