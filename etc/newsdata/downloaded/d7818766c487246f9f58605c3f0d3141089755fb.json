Monetary conditions are now highly favourable. He now knows he can systematically peel back the tariffs over the next 12 months with a series of small, sequential deals,\" Mr Macken said.\n\nWhile Friday's agreement failed to convince anyone of an ideological common ground between the two trading partners, it is a means to spring-load the economy and sharemarket that aligns with the US president's interests.\n\nChina will also buy up to $US50 billion of US agricultural products, and a tariff hike to 30 per cent from 25 per cent scheduled for Tuesday will no longer go ahead, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said.\n\nThe ASX 200 snapped a two-week losing streak on Friday as trade optimism mounted heading into the start of the US session. But investors were reluctant to celebrate in light of the 15-month trade war's frequent lapses in progress. In August, the tariff war initiated a currency war when China allowed the yuan to devalue past the 7-to-the-US dollar level for the first time in a decade.\n\n\"The fundamental issues that still need resolving are intellectual property and market access, and this deal does nothing to address that,\" said Lachlan Hughes from Swell Asset Management. \"They're a long way apart in terms of resolving those issues.\"\n\nThe US earnings season begins this week and manufacturing sector earnings could offer evidence of the trade war's harm. However, the American consumer is still in \"reasonably good shape\" experiencing reasonable wage improvements.\n\nMr Hughes said the market would want to see more before it concluded a proper resolution is afoot.\n\n\"You can feel the political heat rising in Washington. The farm purchases are a good concession from the Chinese, and the farmers have been hurt,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs it stands, further tariff hikes will still take effect in December.\n\nThird quarter Chinese growth is due on Friday, with the market looking for a 6.1 per cent year-on-year expansion, slowing from 6.2 per cent.\n\nAlso on Friday, China decided to open up its financial services market to unrestricted foreign ownership by December 2020. The China Securities Regulatory Commission will scrap foreign ownership limits in futures businesses on January 1, 2020, mutual fund companies on April 1, 2020, and securities firms on December 1, 2020.\n\nSeparately, a strike on an Iranian tanker late on Friday sent the crude oil price rallying. WTI futures rose 0.4 per cent to $US54.91 in New York.\n\nUK banks Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland soared 12 per cent and 11 per cent respectively on Brexit optimism.
