Some, though, predicted an election could yet throw him a lifeline.\n\nLe Monde said the prime minister had now \u201clost control of his Brexit strategy, the calendar and even of his own camp, which is deep in internal crisis\u201d. The prime minister had warned in August the road would be bumpy, the French paper said, \u201cbut did he really expect to be buffeted to this extent, and so soon\u201d?\n\nThe first of Wednesday night\u2019s parliamentary votes \u201cas good as finished off Johnson\u2019s long-promised \u2018do-or-die\u2019 Halloween Brexit,\u201d Le Monde said. His second defeat of the evening, in which MPs refused the prime minister an early election before a no-deal Brexit was no longer possible, was \u201ceven more bitter\u201d.\n\nAdd to that the mounting fury in the Conservative party over his purge of Tory rebels, and Downing St \u201cmust surely be having doubts\u201d, the paper concluded. Johnson may still have some options \u2013 including calling a vote of no confidence in himself \u2013 \u201cbut who outside the Westminster bubble still understands the Battle of Brexit?\u201d\n\nFrance\u2019s Lib\u00e9ration said one of the many problems Johnson faces is \u201cthe mistrust he inspires \u2013 in the opposition parties, which is not unusual, but also in his own MPs. If he were to win a 15 October election, all now fear he might repeal or otherwise get round the new law, and trigger a no-deal Brexit.\u201d\n\nAnother was the Conservatives\u2019 weakened position in parliament, the paper said: \u201cEven if he calls a vote of no confidence in his own government, he still needs a majority \u2013 which he no longer has. Ultimately, the only certainty at this hour is that snap elections will happen before the end of 2019.\u201d\n\nItaly\u2019s Corriere della Sera said Johnson now resembled \u201ca boxer in the corner \u2013 and he risks dragging all Britain to the mat\u201d. The prime minister\u2019s plan to keep no deal on the table to force Europe to accept his demands was \u201ca kamikaze strategy: Brussels will not give up, so Britain continues to run towards the cliff edge\u201d, the paper said.\n\nWith the no-deal option rejected, Johnson turned to new elections, \u201cbut Labour refused to fall for it \u2026 And so we are faced with an impasse. He could yet try another coup, a single-line bill calling for elections. But the impression remains that his own intransigence has forced him into a corner and he no longer has much to offer his country.\u201d\n\nIn Germany, the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung said Johnson\u2019s early strategy had plainly failed. \u201cHow he and his advisers will react, whether he still has an ace up his sleeve, what he will do in the coming days, whether he will try to unblock things with a motion of no confidence in himself \u2013 nothing is certain,\u201d the paper said. \u201cBut for the time being, it looks as if his power has been weakened and his freedom of action is limited.\u201d\n\nSome warned Johnson should not be written off quite yet. Die Welt argued that Johnson\u2019s opponents may not benefit from his current \u201c100% failure rate\u201d. Labour\u2019s calculation \u201cwill be that Johnson\u2019s broken promise \u2013 \u2018We leave on 31 October, do or die\u2019 \u2013 will be punished by voters,\u201d the paper predicted.\n\nBut, it said, Johnson\u2019s opponents \u201ccannot rely on that. His election platform will be a brutal anti-EU campaign with a clear no-deal promise. And faced with a devoted rightwing media, growing voter frustration and an opposition that still does not know which Brexit it wants, his prospects for success are very good.\u201d\n\nDe Volkskrant said Johnson had become \u201ca zombie prime minister\u201d, blocked by the Commons both from maintaining a no-deal Brexit as an option and from holding elections on 15 October, and facing an increasingly rebellious party.\n\n\u201cWith no deal off the table for the time being but no elections yet, Johnson is stuck, just like Theresa May before him,\u201d the Dutch paper said. \u201cThe Kinnock amendment, which could bring May\u2019s agreement back for a fourth vote, may be small lifebuoy. But it was adopted automatically after the government neglected to provide tellers \u2013 an incident that summed up British politics in 2019.\u201d\n\nBelgium\u2019s Le Soir said Britain was \u201cin uncharted waters\u201d. Johnson had been \u201ccheckmated by parliament and is without a majority\u201d, the paper said. \u201cNow he has been refused the early elections that he demanded. The future of Brexit \u2013 and of the country \u2013 has never been more uncertain.\u201d\n\nThe Irish Times took a look at the state of the Conservative party, which it said \u201ccan no longer lay claim to its \u2018strong and stable\u2019 mantra \u2026 It is some feat to make Corbyn look like a statesman, but the man who imagines himself after the great leaders of the ages past has managed just that.\u201d\n\nThe Tory rebels \u201chave emerged as the real champions of conservatism\u201d, the paper argued. \u201cCameron\u2019s referendum has finally united the Tories. But it managed to unite the wrong ones behind the wrong position. Johnson might believe he\u2019s won a battle \u2013 but parliament and the Tory rebels will certainly win the war.\u201d", "description": "Papers damn his \u2018kamikaze strategy\u2019, although some warn he should not be written off yet", "authors": ["Jon Henley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90a1c8d03ef2b8e26751439b5f2ce42bdc78954d/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f45b70e4276dcc715bf930e66b097ee9", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
