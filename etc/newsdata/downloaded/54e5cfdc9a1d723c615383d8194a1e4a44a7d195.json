Rotations are unusual, starters rarely play much, and few if any teams are putting a premium on winning games.\n\nAs such, it's tough to glean much from exhibition stats.\n\nBut what the Boston Celtics and New Orleans rookie Zion Williamson - the No. 1 pick in this year's draft - have been doing so far in the preseason certainly stands out.\n\nThe Celtics are 3-0 after beating Cleveland on Sunday - and have put together a huge run in all three of those games. The latest was a 50-17 spurt against the Cavaliers, a game that was close for most of the first quarter before Boston built what eventually became a 54-point lead.\n\nBoston's other big runs of note in this preseason were a 41-17 stretch last Sunday against Charlotte, and opening the game with a 29-4 burst at Orlando on Friday. On top of the 50-17 run against the Cavs, they added a 26-8 run in the fourth quarter as well.\n\nNo matter who the Celtics have on the court, defense has been the constant. Boston is holding opponents to 36.5% shooting through the first three exhibitions, 25.7% from 3-point range.\n\nBoston Celtics' Kemba Walker, left, shoots against Cleveland Cavaliers' Jarell Martin (24) during the first half of an NBA preseason basketball game in Boston, Sunday, Oct. 13, 2019.

He's shot 29 for 36 from the floor in his last three games, and is averaging 23.3 points and 6.5 rebounds on 71% shooting - all in about 27 minutes per game.\n\nCELTICS 118, CAVALIERS 72\n\nMax Strus scored 14 points and Boston finished with six players in double figures.\n\nKemba Walker returned from a one-game absence with knee soreness and scored 12 points in 15 1/2 minutes, going 3 for 3 from 3-point range. The Celtics held the Cavaliers to 33% shooting, 18% on 3-point tries, and forced 29 turnovers.\n\nSindarius Thornwell scored 12 for Cleveland, which played without Kevin Love (rest) and Tristan Thompson (right groin soreness). Cavs starters Collin Sexton, Matthew Dellavedova and Cedi Osman combined to shoot 3 for 24 and score eight points in 67 minutes.\n\nPELICANS 123, SPURS 114\n\nWilliamson's 22 points led seven New Orleans players in double figures on the way to beating San Antonio.\n\nJrue Holiday scored 16 for the Pelicans, who overcame a 17-point deficit.\n\nBryn Forbes scored 18 and DeMar DeRozan added 16 for the Spurs, who held out LaMarcus Aldridge and Rudy Gay. The Pelicans gave J.J. Redick the day off for rest.\n\nCLIPPERS 118, MELBOURNE UNITED 100\n\nKawhi Leonard and Rodney McGruder sat out for the Los Angeles Clippers, who got 22 points from Montrezl Harrell and 16 points from Lou Williams.\n\nThe Clippers trailed by as many as 11 in the early going and were down to the Australian club 51-47 at the half, then won the third quarter 43-20 - shooting 16 for 20 in the period - to take control.\n\nMelo Trimble led Melbourne United with 22 points.\n\n____\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans' Zion Williamson (1) dunks as he is defended by San Antonio Spurs' Chimezie Metu (7) and DeMarre Carroll during the first half of an NBA preseason basketball game, Sunday, Oct. 13, 2019, in San Antonio.
