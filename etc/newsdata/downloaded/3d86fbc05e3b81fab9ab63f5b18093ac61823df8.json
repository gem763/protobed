We're not spending time on Snapchat and TikTok berating another generation. We're still working for change,' a retired female Twitter user said.\n\n'#okboomer is a lame response to #GenZ's problems. Instead of blaming boomers, maybe they need to figure stuff out like working hard or paying bills instead of mooching of their parents and complaining,' said another.\n\nAs people began to predict the 'end of friendly generational relations' between young and old, millennial and Gen Z-aged social media users joked that baby boomers shouldn't have spent years 'slandering' them.\n\nA tweet read: 'Older people have spent years and years and years slandering millennials mercilessly, but when some young people talk back, that's \"the end of friendly generational relations.\"'\n\nOne user on the platform called the saying 'offensive', 'disrespectful' and a 'new form of hate'.\n\nBut some youths who use the term online have rejected the notion that the phrase is either a response to being labeled snowflake or confined to those over 55.\n\n'Bullying': Twitter users dismissed baby boomers stating that the term was unfair after calling millennials 'snowflakes' for years\n\n'Boomer can be applied more to personality than really what date you were born,' Nick Carver, 17, told NBC.\n\n'I don't think \"OK Boomer\" is a retort on the \"snowflake\" name-calling,' Hannah Hill, 20, also told the outlet.\n\n'It isn't intended in the malicious way that \"snowflake\" is aimed at younger generations. It's a funny way the younger people can laugh off the entitlement of some baby boomers.\n\n'It is a humorous way to say \"OK, whatever' and move on with our lives.\"\n\n'A boomer is really more of a type of personality, someone who is intolerant to new ideas and who is ignorant to new ideas,' Luca Brennan, 17 agreed. 'Stuff like that.'\n\nOn the subject, one person on Twitter added: 'I got called a boomer and I'm 19. I feel like this is just gonna join the other phrases that get overused until they have no meaning anymore.'\n\nMainstream: After the term was picked up by the New York Times and NBC, TikTok users joked that now even their parents were asking about it\n\nIt's over: Many social media users felt that now the term had been explained and entered the mainstream lexicon, it was already becoming trite and overused\n\nAnd many more agreed that now that the phrase had wound its way into the mainstream media, it was officially overused, worn out and hackneyed.\n\n'Oh great the blue check marks are starting to figure out what memes are,' one user said, referring to the journalists reporting on the term.\n\nStill, that likely won't stop people flocking to buy the tongue-in-cheek 'merch'.\n\nShannon O'Connor, 19, told the New York Times that she had received more than $10,000 in orders after sharing her custom-created 'OK Boomer, have a terrible day' hoodie and T-shirt.\n\n'The older generations grew up with a certain mind-set, and we have a different perspective,' she told the outlet.\n\n'A lot of them don't believe in climate change or don't believe people can get jobs with dyed hair, and a lot of them are stubborn in that view. Teenagers just respond, 'Ok, boomer.' It's like, we'll prove you wrong, we're still going to be successful because the world is changing.'", "description": "A new phrase directed at baby boomers has gone viral.
