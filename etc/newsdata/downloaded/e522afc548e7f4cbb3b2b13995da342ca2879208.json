Liverpool led inside five minutes, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain fastening onto 18-year-old Welsh full-back Neco Williams and whipping in a cross which Shkodran Mustafi conspired to turn into the net off his left knee.\n\nBut Arsenal displayed the intensity and Ozil the architecture in a compelling, five-goal first half which provided a harsh lesson, at times, for Liverpool\u2019s young defence.\n\nThere was more than a hint of doubt about the first of the goals that the German carved out. Lucas Torreira was fractionally offside when Bukayo Saka, collecting Ozil\u2019s smart lay-back, struck a shot which goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher could only tip out in front of him to the Uruguayan.\n\nBut frankly, Liverpool defended with a diffidence and timidity which tells Klopp that no member of this back line can be first choice any time soon.\n\nJames Milner covered for the young centre-half Sepp van der Berg, who had allowed one cross from Ainsley Maitand-Niles under his boot and into danger when more indecision allowed Arsenal to go ahead. There was a limit to the patching up he could sustain, though, with such flimsiness all around.\n\nThe visitors\u2019 second came quickly, when Maitland-Miles cross was navigated forward into the six-yard box by Ozil, where the lurking Gabriel Martinelli tapped in.\n\nBut the third was the worst from a Liverpool perspective. Williams played a ball out of defence which placed Harvey Elliott under pressure and saw Ozil pounce on the 16-year-old\u2019s hurried attempt to shift it on and play in Bukayo Saka, who crossed for Martinelli to score.\n\nThe youngster curled a venomous strike from outside the box to send the away fans into delirium and it seemed they'd win\n\nRhian Brewster jumped in the air to celebrate after Arsenal defender Shkodran Mustafi turned one past his own goalkeeper\n\nThe Gunners responded quickly and Lucas Torreira equalised at Anfield, although replays showed he was offside\n\nThe diminutive Uruguayan midfielder has now scored twice this season at Anfield and had a simple finish\n\nGabriel Martinelli then put the visitors 2-1 up after a well worked team move but the Liverpool defence was poor\n\nLiverpool struck back. The absence of VAR was a problem on a night when captain Hector Bellerin escaped a very strong handball appeal when blocking a Naby Keita shot.\n\nKlopp\u2019s players were compensated within two minutes when Martinelli was adjudged to have made a connection with Elliott as he took a ball into the area.\n\nMilner converted the penalty and by half time Liverpool were ruing a missed chance of an equaliser when Divock Origi headed over an elementary chance from Elliott\u2019s well-weighted cross.\n\nEven Milner seemed afflicted by the troubles all around him. A back-pass of horrific proportions from him just after the interval was seized on by Maitland-Niles \u2013 imaginative, full of energy and the pick of Unai Emery\u2019s young players.\n\nArsenal's players came together to celebrate extending their advantage in the first half of action on Wednesday night\n\nMartinelli tucked home his second of the night past Caoimhin Kelleher after being picked out by Bukayo Saka\n\nMartinelli showed his killer instinct to ram home a first time finish after Liverpool had given away possession sloppily\n\nJames Milner converted a penalty just before the break to make the score 3-2 after Harvey Elliot was fouled\n\nMilner's mistake enabled Ainsley Maitland-Niles to tap home after Mesut Ozil pulled the ball back to him\n\nAlex Oxlade-Chamberlain hammered home a powerful finish against his old club and refused to celebrate\n\nHe knocked the ball wide but Ozil materialised again to rescue it and return with a backheel into the path of his teammate who buried it.\n\nThere was not an average in the cup tie. Oxlade-Chamberlain, at fault for Arsenal\u2019s first, hit a bouncing ball into the roof of the net from 20 yards to bring his side back near parity.\n\nThe Origi stepped up, spinning on the edge of the box to unravelling an imperious goal of his own.\n\nIt was hard to see Arsenal recovering from the desperate setback to win the shoot-out. Liverpool were unflinching, before and after Ceballos\u2019 right-footed penalty was saved by Caoimhin Kelleher in the bottom corner.\n\nAdam Lallana jumped on his team-mate's back after the brilliant goal that pulled the Reds back in touching distance\n\nA neat turn allowed Divock Origi to manufacture some space and the Belgian's shot was too powerful for the keeper", "description": "IAN HERBERT AT ANFIELD: In the week when their club captain had dished out abuse at his own fans and could not even find it in himself to apologise, a night beyond belief for Arsenal.", "authors": ["Ian Herbert For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/22/20399874-0-image-a-9_1572474540663.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
