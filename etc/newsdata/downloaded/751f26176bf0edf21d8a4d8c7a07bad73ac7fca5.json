That's when the quarterly expiration of futures and options on indexes and stocks occurs on the same day, sometimes spurring volatility.\n\nWhat's driving the market?\n\nA report on the U.S. housing market and manufacturing data in the Philadelphia area helped to hearten investors about the state of the U.S. economy on Thursday, following the Fed's decision.\n\nExisting-home sales rose (link) 1.3% in August from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.49 million, the National Association of Realtors said, marking the strongest pace of sales since March of last year.\n\nAnd the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's manufacturing index (link) fell to 12.0 in September after registering a reading of 16.8 in August, but was above forecasts for a reading of 10 by economists polled by MarketWatch. Any reading above zero indicates improving conditions.\n\n\"The majority of market participants are still digesting the Fed, and we saw a quick shift of the focus back to the trade war,\" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA. \"Markets thought this was supposed to be an easy week for trade,\" Moya told MarketWatch, but instead, the South China Morning Post reported (link) that a senior White House official said tariffs on Chinese goods could go as high as 50 or even 100%.\n\nRandy Frederick, vice president for trading and derivatives at Schwab, also noted that markets are testing all-time highs. \"There's probably a little bit of technical resistance,\" he said. \"I didn't quite think we'd get here, short of some very positive developments in the trade discussions,\" Frederick added.\n\nThe Fed cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point to a range of 1.75% to 2% Wednesday afternoon (link), as expected. However, three of the 10 members of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee dissented, marking the highest number of dissenters since 2016, and raising doubts that the FOMC would deliver further hoped-for cuts to benchmark rates this year or kick off a new round of bond buying.\n\nInvestors had been anticipating that the Fed would follow the European Central Bank's lead by communicating an appetite for more accommodative monetary policy amid the U.S.-China trade dispute and slowing international economy. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has emphasized that the U.S. economy is slowing but healthy.\n\n\"Bad news used to be good news,\" because it meant the Fed would cut rates, but that's shifted, Schwab's Frederick told MarketWatch. \"I don't think people want rate cuts that much right now if they could have more trade certainty or better economic data.\"\n\nThe Fed's move came before the Paris-based OECD in a Thursday report underscored (link) that intensifying tariff disputes have stalled economic growth world-wide. \"Escalating trade conflicts are taking an increasing toll on confidence and investment, adding to policy uncertainty, aggravating risks in financial markets and endangering already weak growth prospects worldwide,\" the OECD forecasts said.\n\nMeanwhile, the New York Federal Reserve held its third repurchase auction in as many days on Thursday, injecting a further $75 billion into the financial markets by buying securities from Wall Street dealers, an attempt to keep short-term rates from soaring due to a lack of liquidity\n\nOn Wednesday, at the post-decision news conference, Powell said \"it is certainly possible that we'll need to resume the organic growth of the balance sheet sooner than we thought,\" in response to the liquidity shortage.\n\nOn the international trade front, Chinese and U.S. delegates are meeting Thursday and Friday (link) ahead of higher-level meetings expected early October to resolve the yearlong trade dispute.\n\nElsewhere in economic reports, U.S. initial jobless claims rose 2,000 to 208,000 in the seven days ended Sept. 14, the government said Thursday. Claims fell a revised 13,000 to 206,000, a nearly five-month low, in the prior week.\n\nWhich stocks are in focus?\n\nMicrosoft Corp. shares (MSFT)climbed 1.9% on Thursday (link)after the technology giant announced that its board approved a $40 billion share buyback and increased its dividend by 11%.\n\nShares of Datadog Inc. made its public on Thursday and was surging nearly 40%. The cloud-monitoring company made received a buyout bid from Cisco Systems Inc. ahead of its initial public offering (link), according to reports.\n\nAT&T's stock (T) was in focus after the Wall Street Journal reported (link) that it was exploring a sale of part of its DirecTV satellite service. Shares of the telecom company were up 1.`%.\n\nShares of McDermott International Inc.(MDR)slid 24% amid heavy trading (link), amid fears that the provider of engineering and construction services to the energy industry may be considering a bankruptcy after reports that it hired a turnaround consultant. The company denied that rumor.\n\nHow did other markets trade?\n\nRead: Saudi oil attack shows bond traders are worrying more about growth than inflation (link)\n\nIn commodities, West Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery the U.S. benchmark contract, rose 54 cents, or 0.%, to $58.65 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, on concerns that Saudi production will be slow to return after last Saturday's attacks (link). On Monday, it posted the largest daily gain for the most-active contract since Sept. 22, 2008 and finished at its highest level since May, according to Dow Jones Market Data.\n\nGold prices fell $9.80, or 0.7%, at $1,506.00 an ounce, while the U.S. dollar, as measured by the ICE U.S. Dollar Index , a gauge of the buck against a basket of leading rivals, receded by 0.2%.\n\nBond yields were little changed on Thursday afternoon. Both the 10-year U.S. note and the 2-year note were unchanged, at 1.78 and 1.74.\n\nIn Asia overnight, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 1.1%. China's CSI 300 Index gained 0.4%, and Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.4%.\n\nIn Europe, the Stoxx Europe 600 closed 0.6% higher.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 19, 2019 15:01 ET (19:01 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
