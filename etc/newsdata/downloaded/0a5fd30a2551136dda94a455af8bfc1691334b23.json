The Honda Accord, last redesigned for 2018, has been our favorite of the bunch seemingly since dinosaurs walked the Earth. The Honda's latest challenger, the sixth-generation Subaru Legacy, however, has a lot to offer, not the least of which are standard all-wheel drive and a new turbocharged engine option. But does the Legacy bring a strong enough combination of style, space, driving enjoyment, and value to actually challenge the Accord as the king of the heap?\n\nThe Matchup\n\nBuilt in Indiana, the new-for-2020 Legacy makes the switch to Subaru\u2019s Global Platform that underpins its smaller Impreza and Crosstrek models. It\u2019s about two inches longer than before, but its wheelbase remains the same at 108.3 inches. The 2020 Accord is assembled in Ohio and carries over largely unchanged from our 2019 test vehicle. It\u2019s also significantly larger than its new rival. At 192.2 inches, it\u2019s roughly two inches longer than the Subaru, and its 111.4-inch wheelbase stretches longer than any in the class. As a result, the Honda offers significantly more rear-seat legroom than the still-spacious Legacy, not to mention the largest trunk in the segment at 17 cubic feet.\n\nPhoto credit: Michael Simari - Car and Driver More\n\nFor this test we gathered the top trim levels of each, the Legacy Touring XT and the Accord Touring. Both are powered by turbocharged four-cylinders and cost about the same, with as-tested prices around $37,000. The Legacy Touring XT\u2019s 260-hp 2.4-liter flat-four is backed by a continuously variable automatic transmission, or CVT. Although we still prefer a conventional automatic with a torque converter, Subaru\u2019s CVT is one of the industry's best, featuring eight virtual gear steps, paddle shifters on the steering wheel, and relatively lively responses. Honda also employs a CVT in Accords fitted with the standard 192-hp turbo 1.5-liter inline-four. But higher trims with the optional 252-hp turbo 2.0-liter for, like our 2018-model-year test car, get a conventional and tightly geared 10-speed automatic that\u2019s always quick to downshift for bursts of power. What's more, you also can get an Accord Sport model with either engine mated to a six-speed manual, which is unique in this class.", "description": "The redesigned Legacy, now with an optional turbocharged engine, confronts our longtime favorite mid-size sedan.", "authors": ["Scott Oldham"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3t07Ui7lC3dB9DhBAhKmtg--~B/aD03MTc7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/car_and_driver_581/0121a34b86d63ffd1aaea7578fa0dc60", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
