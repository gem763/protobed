Consider the debacle in Syria.\n\nFor a year, Trump said he wanted to withdraw American personnel, but failed to act under pressure from his own aides, who convinced the Syrian Kurds to trust Washington to stay. The Kurds\u2019 discussions on reuniting with the Damascus government\u2014which could have taken control of the border, keeping Turkish forces at bay\u2014lapsed. Then the president abruptly announced America\u2019s departure, triggering an almost immediate Turkish invasion. U.S. forces made a rushed exit and the Kurds desperately invited in the Syrian military.\n\nNext the president denounced Ankara for doing what it had long planned to do, threatening to \u201ctotally destroy and obliterate the economy of Turkey.\u201d Vice President Mike Pence insisted, \u201cThe United States of America simply is not going to tolerate Turkey\u2019s invasion in Syria any further.\u201d The administration announced a mix of economic and personal sanctions, while U.S. legislators proposed additional, harsher measures. Defense Secretary Mark Esper urged NATO members to take \u201cdiplomatic and economic measures\u201d against Turkey.\n\nThen came another policy pirouette, with the administration abandoning its hardline position and negotiating a ceasefire that gave Erdogan most everything he desired. European governments squabbled with NATO\u2019s secretary-general over how to treat fellow member Ankara, which was undermining their objectives in Syria. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo upped the ante, seeming to suggest that Washington might attack Turkey in response to the latter\u2019s conquest. Although the administration prefers peace, Pompeo said, \u201cin the event that kinetic action or military action is needed, you should know that President Trump is fully prepared to undertake that action.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNevertheless, Erdogan dismissed Washington\u2019s demands. His response to U.S. and allied threats: \u201cWe are determined to take our operations to the end. We will finish what we started.\u201d\n\nCould President Trump\u2019s policy be any more incoherent, bizarre, inconsistent, and dangerous?\n\nDespite the almost universal sympathy for the Kurds, their statelet of Rojava is not an American ally. No president has negotiated a treaty with it. No Senate has ratified a treaty with it. No Pentagon official can explain the extent or length of America\u2019s commitment to it.\n\nIn contrast, Turkey has been a member of NATO for more than 67 years. The U.S. has stationed personnel in and cooperated with Ankara for nearly seven decades. Turkish troops fought alongside Americans in the Korean War. Throughout the Cold War, Ankara was seen as a key barrier to Soviet expansion into the Middle East.\n\nSo long as Turkey remains a treaty ally, the United States has an obligation to give its concerns precedence over those of more recent and less formal partners. Frenzied claims that no one on earth will ever trust America again if Washington does not defend the Kurds defy history. The U.S. and most other great\u2014and even middling\u2014powers routinely abandon allies when their interests require doing so.\n\nWashington previously \u201cbetrayed\u201d the Kurds in the 1970s when Iran shifted from confrontation to accommodation with Iraq. It did so equally ostentatiously two years ago when Iraq\u2019s autonomous Kurdish territory held an independence referendum; Washington stood by as the Baghdad government launched a military assault. American officials have abandoned many other allies too: South Vietnam and the Republic of China (Taiwan), for instance. Afghanistan almost certainly will follow soon.\n\nMoreover, Washington\u2019s fidelity to a long-time, official treaty ally matters far more than the ephemeral ties created by a largely American air operation backing one of numerous warring parties within another state. To dismiss Ankara\u2019s long- and oft-expressed concerns would be far more unsettling to serious American friends. If Washington won\u2019t keep faith with its most important partners, then we should really ask: who can count on America\u2019s support?\n\nOf course, Turkey has been anything but a good ally of late. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has moved in a decidedly authoritarian and Islamist direction. His government continues to occupy much of Cyprus and challenge borders with Greece. Worse, Ankara prioritizes fighting the Kurds over battling the Islamic State. Indeed, early in the Syrian conflict, Turkey aided ISIS, and Erdogan\u2019s son may have profited off the group\u2019s illicit oil trade. Perhaps worst of all, at least from NATO\u2019s standpoint, the Turkish and Russian presidents have been playing international footsie.\n\nThe risks of continuing to treat Turkey as a normal NATO member could be great. Ankara gains intelligence, influences policy, and affects operations. Moreover, the U.S. is believed to store some 50 nuclear bombs at Incirlik Airbase. Any attempt to wreck the Turkish economy, or worse, retaliate militarily for Turkish activity in Syria, would force Erdogan to respond\u2014if only to preserve his nationalist credentials. His government could attempt to seize these weapons, which would also advance his ambitions to make Ankara a nuclear power.\n\nInstead of denouncing and punishing Ankara, the Americans and Europeans should address the more fundamental problem of Turkey\u2019s NATO membership. When the alliance was being negotiated, Canadian and American officials supported creating a process to address precisely this problem: a member whose government shifts away from democratic values. But, as reports historian Tim Sayle, the British and French opposed the idea, and so it was dropped. When asked about the possibility, Senator Arthur Vandenberg observed: \u201cUnder such circumstances the pact simply ceases to be operative in respect to them.\u201d\n\nHowever, that isn\u2019t working with Turkey. Washington is imposing economic sanctions on and threatening war with a fellow member, while a half dozen European nations have suspended arms sales. This dissension undermines the alliance\u2019s battle-worthiness. Now is the time to revive the expulsion proposal.\n\nOf course, the Turkey made in Mustafa Kemal Ataturk\u2019s image never was a liberal beacon. But there was an argument for cutting corners during the Cold War, when the Soviet Union loomed large as a threat. It reflected Jeanne Kirkpatrick\u2019s famous distinction between authoritarian and totalitarian regimes: accepting a bit of the former might help prevent the latter.\n\nWhether that analysis was true has been the subject of much controversy. Nevertheless, even theoretically, no such necessity exists today. An alliance supposedly committed to liberal, democratic values should not blithely accept Ankara\u2019s move in a decidedly hostile direction. Expulsion or suspension would be an appropriate response. NATO could at least create a form of associate membership, eliminating any leadership role and automatic security guarantee.\n\nAnkara likely would reject any attempt to downgrade its NATO standing, which would conveniently resolve the current controversy. However, Turkey is not the only potentially troublesome member. One can easily imagine a turn towards authoritarianism among many Central and Eastern European and Balkan members. Claims that Hungary is already there are overstated, but in several countries, the reform process is incomplete at best.\n\nMoreover, in the main, as one moves east, countries become less important to American security and generate greater possible complications involving Russia. To limit future problems, the U.S. should stop reflexively adding as allies most any nation or group that asks. Bringing in Montenegro was a bit like adding the Duchy of Grand Fenwick featured in the novel The Mouse that Roared. Inducting North Macedonia makes little more sense.\n\nAdding Georgia and/or Ukraine would be inviting war with Moscow, presumably the opposite objective of the alliance. Elevating informal relationships to ally-like status would be even more problematic. For instance, the Syrian Kurds have ensnared the United States in a volatile region amid multiple potential combatants while providing few security benefits.\n\nTrimming alliance membership would be better policy. (There is, in fact, reason to reconsider America\u2019s role in NATO, but that argument can be left for another article.) Today American policymakers collect allies like most people accumulate Facebook friends. But more is not better. In the case of the Middle East, especially, the U.S. would do far better with less, starting with Turkey.\n\nDoug Bandow is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute and former special assistant to President Ronald Reagan.
