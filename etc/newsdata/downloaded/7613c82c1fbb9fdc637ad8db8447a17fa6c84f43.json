Two companies on the list include video surveillance companies Hikvision and Dahua Technology. The American chipmakers took a big hit on the announcement with shares of Ambarella (AMBA) tanking more than 10% Monday morning. Ambarella makes processors for cameras and surveillance equipment and conducts business with Hikvision. It is not clear how much of Ambarella\u2019s revenue comes from business with Hikvision, but management previously warned that intensifying trade tensions is creating an uncertain business environment, and thus, would likely have a negative impact on business.\n\nChina has indicated that it intends to hit back. When asked whether or not China intends to retaliate against the U.S. blacklist, Geng Shuang, China\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman, told reporters to \u201cstay tuned.\u201d Shuang also denied any human rights abuses in Xinjiang. He also said that the U.S. should immediately correct its mistake and stop interfering with China\u2019s internal affairs.\n\nThe growing tensions come as high-level trade negotiators from the U.S. and China are scheduled to meet in Washington at the end of this week. As of now, the trade negotiations are still expected to take place as scheduled.\n\nMeanwhile, Federal Reserve Chairman is scheduled to speak in Denver, Colorado at the The 61st National Association for Business Economics (NABE) Annual Meeting. He will be discussing \u201cData Dependence in an Evolving Economy.\u201d\n\nTraders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York.

In a joint statement, the companies said that the strategic partnership will allow them to \u201cwork together to broaden commercial space access and transform global travel technologies.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoeing's strategic investment facilitates our effort to drive the commercialization of space and broaden consumer access to safe, efficient, and environmentally responsible new forms of transportation,\u201d Brian Schettler, senior managing director of Boeing HorizonX Ventures, said in a statement. \u201cOur work with Virgin Galactic, and others, will help unlock the future of space travel and high-speed mobility.\u201d\n\nThis investment comes as Boeing deals with continued fallout from its 737 MAX jets. Most recently, disagreements between U.S. and European regulators threatened to further delay the return of the 737 MAX, and a union representing Southwest Airlines (LUV) pilots sued Boeing. The pilots argue that Boeing rushed out the 737 MAX jet and neglected to share key information about a feature that contributed to the deadly accidents.\n\nDomino\u2019s Pizza (DPZ) shares tanked more than 5% Tuesday after the pizza chain reported a miss on the top and bottom lines and weaker-than-expected same-store sales growth both in the U.S. and internationally.\n\nThe pizza giant missed U.S. same-store sales growth expectations for the fourth consecutive quarter, as competition in the fast-food space continues to heat up. Domino\u2019s also updated its long-term guidance and now expects U.S. same-stores sales growth between 7% to 10% over the next two to three years. It previously anticipated same-store sales growth between 8% and 12% over a three to five year period.", "description": "U.S. stock futures indicted a lower open across all of the major indices Tuesday, as investors continued to monitor the escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China.", "authors": ["Heidi Chung"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/EmF2uKO64uzgpDjSYWiPRQ--~B/aD0zNzY3O3c9NTY1MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/14593260-e11a-11e9-af8d-5ed31a9c0587", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
