REUTERS/Toby Melville\n\nIn a lengthy, emotional statement, Prince Harry said on Tuesday that the couple had taken legal action in response to what he called \u201cbullying\u201d by some sections of the British press.\n\n\u201cThough this action may not be the safe one, it is the right one,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMy deepest fear is history repeating itself. I\u2019ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditized to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person. I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.\u201d\n\nHis mother, Princess Diana, became one of the most photographed women on the planet after she married into the British royal family.\n\nShe died in a car crash in Paris in 1997 after being followed through the streets by photographers. Her funeral was watched by hundreds of millions of people around the world.\n\nSchillings, the law firm representing Markle, described the publication of her letter as part of a \u201ccampaign by this media group to publish false and deliberately derogatory stories about her, as well as her husband.\n\n\u201c...We have issued proceedings to redress this breach of privacy, infringement of copyright and the aforementioned media agenda.\u201d It did not give details about the letter in question or publication date.\n\nIn his statement, Prince Harry said the newspaper had \u201cpurposely misled (readers) by strategically omitting select paragraphs, specific sentences, and even singular words.\u201d\n\nThe Mail on Sunday denied the account.\n\n\u201cThe Mail on Sunday stands by the story it published and will be defending this case vigorously,\u201d said a spokesman. \u201cSpecifically, we categorically deny that the Duchess\u2019s letter was edited in any way that changed its meaning.\u201d\n\nSchillings said the case was being paid for privately by Prince Harry and Markle, who are also known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.\n\nThe royal couple have been touring southern Africa together with their baby son, Archie. The prince visited the same landmine clearance project in Angola that Diana had been to see just a few months before her death.\n\nThe 35-year-old prince, who is Queen Elizabeth\u2019s grandson and sixth in line to the throne, said the legal action had been \u201cmany months in the making\u201d.\n\nHe referred to the \u201cdouble standards\u201d of some elements of the tabloid press, which have written critical articles about the couple in recent months but provided largely positive coverage of their ongoing tour.\n\n\u201cI have been a silent witness to her private suffering for too long. To stand back and do nothing would be contrary to everything we believe in,\u201d he added.", "description": "Meghan Markle, the wife of Britain's Prince Harry, has started legal proceedings against the Mail on Sunday newspaper over the publication of a private letter that her lawyers said was \"unlawful\".", "authors": ["Costas Pitas", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1436005260&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF903EM", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
