This month the principal chief of the Cherokee nation, Chuck Hoskin, appointed Kimberly Teehee as delegate to Congress \u2013 taking the federal government up on its nearly 200-year-old offer.\n\n\u201cI feel we are in an environment now where Congress is more educated about Native American issues,\u201d Teehee said.\n\n\u201cWe have four members of Congress, people who are citizens of federally recognised tribes, who take on our issues and champion our issues. There is a bipartisan Congressional Native American caucus, whose job is to educate, on a bipartisan basis, members of Congress about Native American issues.\u201d\n\nThe Cherokee Nation has never sent a delegate to Congress before. While they are hopeful the House will honor the terms of the New Echota treaty, there will be a wait before \u2013 hopefully \u2013 Teehee can take up her post.\n\nIf she does, she will be able to advocate for the nearly 380,000 citizens of the Cherokee Nation, which spans almost 7,000 square miles in Oklahoma. The nation has its own elected government, but is reliant on the federal government financially. In 2019, Hoskin said, the Cherokee nation is thriving compared with previous decades. That influenced the decision to push for further representation.\n\n\u201cThe Cherokee Nation is in a position of relative strength, both political strength and economic strength, with the wellbeing of our citizens on the rise,\u201d Hoskin said.\n\n\u201cI think now is the time to assert this treaty provision, so that we can do more than what we\u2019ve done in recent decades. We\u2019re sort of standing outside of the Congress and advocating for our needs and for the government of the United States to live up to its obligations. [Now we could be] be inside Congress, and do what our ancestors contemplated when they negotiated those terms.\u201d\n\nWhile the Cherokee Nation is self-governing, running and managing its own schools, hospitals and infrastructure programs, it relies on grants from the government. That funding comes from the \u201cdiscretionary funding\u201d portion of the budget. But the amount of discretionary funding can wax and wane depending on negotiations between Congress and the president, or the state of the economy.\n\n\u201cSo, depending on the political dynamics, you know, there may be a contraction in any given year of the discretionary spending in this country,\u201d Hoskin said.\n\nChanging that will be one of the key aims for the Nation, and Teehee. Currently a main path to introducing legislation is through approaching sympathetic members of Congress. With a delegate, the Cherokee Nation would be able to bring in their own bills, which could potentially lead to a vote in Congress.\n\nProfessor Lindsay Robertson, Chickasaw Nation endowed chair in Native American law at the University of Oklahoma, said the impact of having a delegate in the House should not be underestimated.\n\n\u201cIt could be enormously beneficial,\u201d Robertson said.\n\n\u201c[The delegate] would be entitled to membership in committees. They could vote in committees, they could introduce legislation and they could speak on the floor of the House of Representatives.\n\n\u201cOn top of that, there\u2019s the benefit that comes from simply being in the room. The Cherokees having a delegate \u2013 who could well opt to serve as a representative for Indian country, for Native rights in general \u2013 in the halls of Congress all the time could be enormously beneficial to all tribes, not just the Cherokees.\u201d\n\nHoskin said that \u201ceven though the Cherokee Nation congressional delegate is first and foremost and advocate for the Cherokee Nation\u201d, he expects that being afforded a delegate to Congress is something that can help Native Americans across the US. He says his efforts have been applauded by other tribes.\n\n\u201cIn 2019, I think tribal leaders recognize the benefit of solidarity: that we get more done together than we do separately,\u201d Hoskin said.\n\n\u201cAnd so I have been very careful to tell tribal leaders and to express in interviews that my expectation is that Kim Teehee will be somebody with an open door to leaders across Indian country.\n\n\u201cAnd no doubt some of the issues that she\u2019ll work on will be issues that are of concern not just to the Cherokee Nation but across tribal governments in this country.\u201d\n\nThe question now is whether politicians in Washington decide to let Teehee take up her post. The House could decide on its own that it is able to appoint a Cherokee delegate, but members could also deem that the Senate, and perhaps even the president also need to agree.\n\nTeehee is optimistic she will be appointed, but knows that process will take time. In the meantime, she said she will push Congress to grant the Cherokee Nation the right that was promised in 1835.\n\n\u201cI want to take one step at a time, I don\u2019t want to get ahead of ourselves. But I also want the discussion and the analysis and the process to keep moving. I hope that there\u2019s no stall and that we\u2019re all continuing to be motivated about this,\u201d Teehee said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve nearly 200 years, and we can wait a little longer. But I do want it done.\u201d", "description": "Kimberly Teehee could become the Cherokee Nation\u2019s first delegate to Congress \u2013 if Washington lets her", "authors": ["Adam Gabbatt"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a32341df283f3b956d3b786d0febd130dae3adce/0_123_3350_2010/master/3350.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=17a4f54e00cef16e3971ad1b0a6f17f1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
