The defense argues she may be to blame.", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cHe came in with his mad face and Ace was crying on the bunk,\u201d she said.\n\nThen, using the Scooby-Doo doll, she showed the jury how her mother\u2019s boyfriend slammed her brother down on a bed and then punched him.\n\n\u201cI saw him roll off the bed,\u201d the girl said of the toddler. \u201cHe just kept crying.\u201d\n\nTo prosecutors, the girl is the sole eyewitness in their case against the mother\u2019s live-in boyfriend, James Embre, 26, who is on trial on a murder charge. They say Embre, angry about having to walk the child home from day care on April 17, 2018, was later smoking marijuana and playing video games with the children\u2019s mother when he went to another room and beat the boy.\n\nBut Embre\u2019s attorney, Jonathan Zucker, put forward a shocking defense. He told jurors that his client did not hit Ace and argued that the boy was killed by someone else in the apartment in Southeast Washington \u2014 either his sister or his mother.\n\n\u201cThis is a very disturbed child who had a habit of hurting Ace,\u201d Zucker said of the 7-year-old girl. Her accusations, which he called \u201cfantasy and fabrication,\u201d are the only evidence against his client, he added.\n\nIt is rare for a child so young to be a witness in a murder trial, but with her account critical to both sides, the second-grader has been subject to intense questioning. Already on the stand for two days, she is set to return Monday.\n\nBoth Zucker and Cynthia Wright, an assistant U.S. attorney who specializes in cases involving the deaths of infants and young children, have had a hard time helping the girl focus during hours of testimony. At one point, Judge Juliet McKenna encouraged the girl to take a break and run around the courthouse halls with Wright.\n\nWhat quickly became apparent was that the girl\u2019s testimony was often contradictory. At one point, she said Embre never hit her or her brother. Then she said Embre hit her brother on his back. Then she said Embre hit her brother on his stomach. Then she repeated that Embre never hit them.\n\nZucker played videos in which the girl was recorded saying that Embre struck her and her brother. But on the stand, depending on how Zucker or Wright asked questions, she either elaborated on her assertions or contradicted them, saying at points that she did not know why she made her earlier statements or that she was being \u201cdramatic.\u201d\n\nThe girl often shrugged her shoulders, prompting McKenna to remind her to \u201cuse your words.\u201d\n\nBefore the trial started, Zucker objected to Wright calling the 7-year-old as a witness because of the girl\u2019s age. Wright argued that Zucker should not be allowed to name Ace\u2019s sister or the children\u2019s mother as alternate suspects, saying there was no reliable evidence against them. McKenna overruled them both.\n\nWright told jurors in her opening statement that Embre first became angry that he had to walk Ace about 40 minutes from his day care that April evening to their apartment in the 3400 block of A Street in Southeast Washington.\n\nLater that night, the prosecutor said, Embre and the children\u2019s mother, Ziykillya Thurman-Ahmad, were in her bedroom smoking and drinking. Embre repeatedly went into the bedroom where Ace and his sister were, Wright said, and beat the boy.\n\nAt one point, Wright said, Embre rushed back and said Ace was not breathing and had vomited.\n\nWright told the jury that Ace had fractures to his ribs and that there was evidence of prior bruising. She said he bled internally from a lacerated liver and an artery that supplies blood to the heart.\n\n\u201cIn less than two hours, this beautiful, healthy child was dead,\u201d Wright said, showing two poster-size photos. One showed Ace smiling; the other showed him in the morgue.\n\nPolice say 2-year-old who died was severely beaten and suffered internal bleeding\n\nZucker told jurors that Embre had no history of abusing the boy.\n\nThe attorney turned his focus to the others who had been in the apartment. The boy\u2019s sister had been disciplined in school for getting into fights when she was younger, Zucker said. He said her mother told authorities that the girl once gave her brother a black eye.\n\nAfter Ace died, Zucker said, the girl was temporarily placed in a foster home as the case was investigated. He said the foster mother had the girl removed because she was hitting other children.\n\nZucker also told the jury that the children\u2019s mother should be considered a possible suspect. Thurman-Ahmad has a history of mental illness, illegal drug use and was a battered child herself, Zucker said. He said she had told authorities that to discipline the children, she had previously struck Ace with her hand and her daughter with an electric cord.\n\nAuthorities were alerted to Ace\u2019s injuries when Thurman-Ahmad, who also is expected to testify, called 911 and then ran outside and flagged down a police officer.\n\nAs dramatic body-camera video was shown to the jury, D.C. police officer Jeffrey Buchanan described how he and his colleagues tried to revive the child in the back of a squad car.\n\n\u201cCome on, big guy. Come on,\u201d one of the officers in the video implores. Ace, wearing a yellow T-shirt and training shorts, appeared lifeless as one of the officers stuck two fingers down his throat to see whether anything was blocking the toddler\u2019s airway. Then the officer started CPR, rhythmically pushing on the boy\u2019s chest, turning him over and then pushing on his back.\n\nThe officer who performed the CPR, is \u201cpretty banged up. Real emotional,\u201d Buchanan testified, his voice cracking.\n\nSeconds later on the video, sirens from the ambulance are heard in the background. Ace, accompanied by Embre, was taken to a hospital.\n\nThurman-Ahmad and her daughter followed in another police car.\n\nJurors, who were played the body-camera video from the driver of that car, heard Thurman-Ahmad yelling and questioning her daughter.\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Thurman-Ahmad asks.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d the girl responds.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t know? You were in there with Ace,\u201d Thurman-Ahmad says. \u201cDid James do something? What did he do? Did he whup Ace? Tell me. What did he do?\u201d\n\nHer daughter responds, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nThurman-Ahmad yells back, \u201cYou can\u2019t say you don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nHer daughter then says Embre had his \u201cmad face\u201d on when he came into the room and that he \u201cpunched Ace.\u201d The girl said Embre punched her in her leg and told her not to say anything to her mother.\n\nEarlier, while still in the apartment, the girl told a police officer and her mother that Ace twice fell out of the lower bunk bed onto the floor.\n\nEmbre\u2019s lawyer insists a single punch would not have resulted in multiple injuries to the boy. Zucker argued that the evidence shows that Ace was beaten numerous times previously, as well as on the night he died.\n\nIn court, Zucker tried to get the girl to admit to harming her brother, either on purpose or by accident.\n\n\u201cI never hurted Ace,\u201d she said with a raised voice.\n\n\u201cDid you ever jump or stand on Ace?\u201d Zucker asked.\n\n\u201cHow do I jump on a 2-year-old?\u201d the girl asked. \u201cI never standed on him either.\u201d\n\nWhen the girl finished testifying late Thursday, she walked to Zucker, hugged him and gave him a picture she had colored while she was testifying. Then she hugged Wright.\n\nWith a letter of support from Kim Kardashian-West.
