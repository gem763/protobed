They said they were readying a subpoena demanding documents related to the president\u2019s dealings with Ukraine.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Trump may not \u201crecognize how dangerous his statements are\u201d against a whistleblower who exposed a July phone call that Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. On the call, Trump pressed for an investigation of Democratic political rival Joe Biden and his family.\n\nHouse intelligence committee Chairman Adam Schiff, accusing Trump of inviting violence against the whistleblower, said any effort to interfere with the Democrats\u2019 investigations would be considered evidence of obstruction and could be included in articles of impeachment.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not fooling around here,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

House Oversight and Reform Chairman Elijah Cummings wrote in a memo to committee members Wednesday that the action is necessary because the White House has ignored multiple requests.\n\nGiven the \u201cstark and urgent warnings\u201d the inspector general for the intelligence community has delivered to Congress, Cummings said, the panel has \u201cno choice but to issue this subpoena.\u201d\n\nThe subpoena will be directed toward acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and request 13 separate batches of documents related to the July call and other related matters. The call unfolded against the backdrop of a $250 million foreign aid package for Ukraine that was being readied by Congress but stalled by Trump.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said the subpoena is \u201cnothing but more document requests, wasted time and taxpayer dollars that will ultimately show the president did nothing wrong.\u201d\n\nThe subpoena announcement came as House and Senate staff prepared to meet with the State Department\u2019s inspector general Wednesday afternoon. A State Department invitation, reviewed by The Associated Press, requested an \u201curgent\u201d meeting with staff from eight House and Senate panels.\n\nThe invitation said the inspector general, Steve Linick, \u201cwould like to discuss and provide staff with copies of documents related to the State Department and Ukraine.\u201d The documents were obtained from the State Department\u2019s acting legal adviser, according to the email.\n\nMeanwhile, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo acknowledged Wednesday he was on the phone call between Trump and Zelensky that is at the center of the impeachment inquiry. He also continued to push back against what he said was Democrats\u2019 \u201cbullying and intimidation.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have scheduled closed-door depositions Thursday with former special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker and next week with ousted U.S. Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch and three other State Department officials. Pompeo told the committees on Tuesday that the dates they had set were \u201cnot feasible,\u201d but at least some of the officials are still coming.\n\nThe Democrats said that Pompeo\u2019s resistance amounted to his own intimidation.\n\n\u201cAny effort to intimidate witnesses or prevent them from talking with Congress \u2014 including State Department employees \u2014 is illegal and will constitute evidence of obstruction of the impeachment inquiry,\u201d said Schiff, Cummings and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel in a Tuesday notice to Pompeo.\n\nThey said that if he was on Trump\u2019s call, \u201cSecretary Pompeo is now a fact witness in the House impeachment inquiry.\u201d And they warned, \u201cHe should immediately cease intimidating department witnesses in order to protect himself and the president.\u201d\n\nDemocrats often note that obstruction was one of the impeachment articles against Richard Nixon, who resigned the presidency in 1974 in the face of almost certain impeachment.\n\nThe committees are seeking voluntary testimony from the current and former officials as the House digs into State Department actions and Trump\u2019s other calls with foreign leaders that have been shielded from scrutiny. They have also subpoenaed Pompeo for documents.\n\nVolker played a direct role in trying to arrange meetings between Rudy Giuliani, who is Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, and Zelensky, the chairmen said. The State Department said that Volker has confirmed that he put a Zelensky adviser in contact with Giuliani, at the Ukraine adviser\u2019s request.\n\nThe former envoy, who has since resigned his position and so is not necessarily bound by Pompeo\u2019s directions, is eager to appear as scheduled on Thursday, said one person familiar with the situation, but unauthorized to discuss it and granted anonymity. The career professional believes he acted appropriately and wants to tell his side of the situation, the person said.\n\nYovanovitch, the career diplomat whose abrupt recall from Ukraine earlier this year raised questions, is set to appear next week. The Democrats also want to hear from T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, a counselor at the State Department, who also listened in on the Trump-Zelensky call, they said.\n\nA whistleblower alleged in an August letter to the inspector general for the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, that the White House tried to \u201clock down\u201d Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with the new Ukrainian president because it was worried about the contents being leaked to the public. The complaint was eventually made public after acting Director of Intelligence Joseph Maguire withheld it from Congress for several weeks.\n\nIn recent days, it has been disclosed that the administration similarly tried to restrict information about Trump\u2019s calls with other foreign leaders, including Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin and Saudi Arabia\u2019s Mohammed bin Salman, by moving memos onto a highly classified computer system.\n\nUkraine\u2019s president told reporters Tuesday he has never met or spoken with Giuliani. Zelensky insisted that \u201cit is impossible to put pressure on me.\u201d He said he stressed the importance of the military aid repeatedly in discussions with Trump, but \u201cit wasn\u2019t explained to me\u201d why the money didn\u2019t come through until September.\n\nIn Russia, Putin said scrutiny over the phone call showed that Trump\u2019s adversaries are using \u201cevery excuse\u201d to attack him.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "House democrats said they were readying a subpoena demanding documents related to the president\u2019s dealings with Ukraine Wednesday.", "authors": ["Lisa Mascaro", "Mary Clare Jalonick", "Matthew Lee", "Jonathan Lemire"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/nancy-pelosi.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}
