But Hestrin said French had attacked Sanchez from behind while the off-duty officer \u2015 a seven-year veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department \u2015 was holding his 1\u00bd-year-old son in a food-tasting line, AP reported.\n\nThe officer, Hestrin said, believed that he\u2019d been shot in the head and that an active shooter was on the loose. Sanchez fired 10 rounds of his handgun, fatally striking French and critically wounding French\u2019s parents, Russell and Paola French. Neither French nor his parents were armed.\n\n\u201cIt was out of the blue and the officer wasn\u2019t expecting it,\u201d Hestrin said of French\u2019s attack of Sanchez, according to CBS News. \u201cHe\u2019s hit in the back of his head while he\u2019s holding his child in his hands ... I can only imagine those facts played into the jury\u2019s decision here.\u201d\n\nDA Mike Hestrin announces grand jury finding in Corona Costco shooting case.\n\n\n\nClick link to see news release: https://t.co/U8OV2thy4d\n\n\n\nPress conference can be seen on Facebook: https://t.co/2DmEkHtMEF pic.twitter.com/h8MM4SMbdM \u2014 Riverside County DA's Office (@RivCoDA) September 25, 2019\n\nDuring the news conference, Hestrin played a grainy surveillance video that investigators had relied on during their probe of the incident. As the Los Angeles Times noted, however, the footage is of such low quality that it\u2019s difficult to decipher what exactly is happening in the clip.\n\nThe video appears to show French, wearing a striped shirt, being pulled across the store by a male family member before the pair fall one at the time to the ground. \u201cSanchez is barely visible in the far-left frame,\u201d the LA Times said.\n\nProsecutors said the incident happened very quickly, with Sanchez firing his weapon less than four seconds after he was hit.\n\nThe officer, who remains on paid administrative leave as the LAPD conducts an administrative inquiry into whether he followed department policies, reportedly suffered minor injuries in the incident. His child was not hurt.\n\nThe off-duty @LAPDHQ officer who fatally shot #KennethFrench, a schizophrenic man, will not face criminal charges. I spoke to the French Family's attorney who reacted to @RivCoDA's press conference.

French had been off his medications due to other health complications, the lawyer said, which may have affected his behavior that day.\n\nStill, Galipo said the shooting had not been a justified response to French\u2019s actions.\n\nThe attorney said French\u2019s father had stepped between his son and Sanchez immediately after the attack, and that both French\u2019s dad and mom had tried to explain to the officer that their son had a mental disability, CBS News reported.\n\n\u201cI told Officer Sanchez not to shoot, twice, I even said \u2018please,\u2019 I was pleading for our son and our lives,\u201d Paola French said at an August news conference.\n\nThe family is planning to file a federal lawsuit over the shooting within the next month, AP reported.\n\nIra Salzman, Sanchez\u2019s attorney, said Wednesday that the officer was \u201cgratified\u201d by the grand jury\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cSal believed he was shot,\u201d Salzman said. \u201cThe case was a terrible tragedy.\u201d", "description": "Officer Salvador Sanchez fatally shot Kenneth French, a 32-year-old nonverbal man with schizophrenia, and critically wounded the man's parents.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8c7b99220000310051fc29.png?cache=wgthjqi3r1&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
