Six are sold, and 16 are for sale. (Benjamin C Tankersley/For The Washington Post)\n\nMelissa and Justen Knight were ensconced in their Mount Vernon Square rental apartment one late August evening imagining life in their recently acquired new home.\n\nThat would be a townhouse in Portrait Square on Seventh Street in Brookland, a quiet, modest residential neighborhood in Northeast Washington of small single-family houses, three-story apartment buildings and new multiunit construction.\n\nActually the structure still has to be built, but the layout and features are chosen and the couple are excited about moving into their first home.\n\n\u201cWe were only casually shopping because we didn\u2019t want to move till the spring, but when we stumbled on the model for Portrait Square we took a look,\u201d Justen Knight said.\n\nPortrait Square will comprise 22 four-story townhouses in four groupings on a lot next to Holy Redeemer College at 3112 Seventh St. NE. Madison Homes, the builder, bought the lot from the Redemptorists.\n\n\u201cThe college building goes back to the 1920s. It was used largely as a home for students studying for the priesthood,\u201d said Russ Rosenberger, president and founder of Madison Homes.\n\n\u201cWe wanted the facade and architecture of our townhouses to complement the college so we were conscious of our brick and siding selection,\u201d he said. The townhouse exterior fronts are a mix of reddish, tan and rust-colored bricks and they visually match the college.\n\n[Blackburn Townhomes has several units for sale, with more on the way]\n\n1 of 15 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Buying New | Portrait Square in Northeast Washington View Photos There will be 22 four-level townhouses priced from $839,900 to $929,900.

One block or grouping of five townhouses \u2014 those facing Seventh Street \u2014 are complete, and foundations for three other blocks of townhouses are laid. There will be a landscaped courtyard between the middle two groupings.\n\nThe Knights\u2019 home, which they hope to move into next spring, will be in one of the groupings off Seventh Street.\n\n\u201cWe love things that are clean-lined. Portrait Square is super sleek and modern,\u201d Melissa Knight said.\n\nTwo models are offered \u2014 Halsman with 16-feet-wide interior units and Newton with 18-feet-wide end units.\n\nHalsman model Unit 3056 opens from a front stoop into a small room designed to be an office but that can be configured for any purpose.\n\n[They love the kitchen and the neighborhood cohesion of this new development in Odenton, Md.]\n\nUp one flight is the open-plan living area. The kitchen is on one end of the floor with glass doors leading to an optional deck, a center island with sink and dishwasher and the stove and refrigerator against the wall. A dining table is in the room center. Three vertical windows frame the living room on the opposite end. \u201cWe liked that the home was customizable,\u201d Melissa Knight said. \u201cWe chose to install a fireplace in the living room.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe kitchen is outfitted with quartz counters, soft-close cabinet doors and drawers, Whirlpool stainless-steel refrigerator, Kitchen Aid five-burner gas stove and convection oven, Delta faucet and stainless steel single-bowl sink. (Benjamin C Tankersley/For The Washington Post)\n\nThe third floor is bookended by two bedrooms. One bathroom opens from the hallway. The owner\u2019s bathroom opens from their bedroom.\n\nThe fourth level offers a loft lounge that opens to a roof terrace plus a third bedroom and bathroom. \u201cWe\u2019ll put in a wet bar up there so we don\u2019t have to keep going downstairs to get the important things,\u201d she said.\n\nPre-wires for laundry appliances are in a closet opposite the bathroom. A tankless water heater means you can have the dishwasher and a lot of showers going at the same time, Rosenberger said.\n\nNearby: The Arts Walk at Monroe Street Market showcases more than two dozen art studios and invites people to look around or buy artwork.\n\nThe Brookland Monroe Street farmers market takes place every Saturday from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. until early winter along the Arts Walk.\n\nBusboys and Poets is a cafe, restaurant, bookstore and place to hang out.\n\nThe colorful Dance Place building offers children\u2019s and adult classes in every dance form you can think of.\n\nSchools: Noyes Elementary, Brookland Middle, Dunbar High.\n\nTransit: Brookland-CUA on the Red Line is in walking and biking distance. There are 10 bike racks and 16 lockers. The Maryland-District border is several blocks to the east. Monroe Street, a wide residential thoroughfare crosses through Brookland east and west. Michigan Avenue runs along the northern boundary of Brookland; Rhode Island Avenue runs along the southern boundary; South Dakota Avenue is on the east; and Michigan Avenue is to the west.\n\n\n\nAll townhouses are designed with a fourth-level roof terrace.
