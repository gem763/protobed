The notice went viral and thousands showed up to pay their respects.\n\nNot among the scores of mourners? The man's two \u2013 living \u2013 sons, who say their dad walked out on them as teenagers.\n\nNow there are questions surrounding Legacy Options Funeral and Cremation Services in Naples, and whether that business misled the thousands who turned up for Pearson's service or, as the funeral home contends, it was informed of the familial connection too late to notify the public.\n\nPearson, who served in the Army from 1962 to 1964 and was discharged honorably, died at age 80 in Naples, Fla., in late August. Seemingly alone at the time of his death, Legacy Options penned his obituary, including the line that Pearson had \u201cno immediate family\u201d and the invitation to the public to attend his burial service, which was being held with military honors at Sarasota National Cemetery.\n\nSeveral thousand people, most of whom were total strangers to Pearson, ended up attending his funeral from areas throughout the state after the death announcement post went viral.\n\n'IT WAS REALLY OVERWHELMING': THOUSANDS ATTEND FUNERAL OF VETERAN WHO HAD NO FAMILY\n\n\"With social media, it went right from there,\" funeral director Michael Hoyt told \"Fox & Friends\" last Wednesday after the ceremony. \"It was very humbling seeing all of the veterans and community members come out to pay tribute to Mr. Pearson. It was for him ... but seeing all of the veterans there, knowing the love and appreciation and honor that they were all being shown yesterday was really overwhelming.\"\n\nHoyt said the small, family-run business has always offered free funeral services to any homeless or indigent veteran, telling host Ainsley Earhardt he learned about Pearson from a Naples social worker.\n\nBut the day before the ceremony \u2013 after the invitation had gone viral \u2013 the funeral home received a call from one of Pearson's two sons, according to the Sarasota Herald-Tribune. Edward Pearson Jr. told the newspaper his father walked out on him and his younger brother, James, when the boys were teens. At some point after Pearson left, the brothers were told he had died. Then they saw the funeral announcement.\n\n\u201cI was kind of surprised he was still alive all this time and I never knew about it,\u201d Pearson Jr. told the Herald-Tribune. \u201cI\u2019m hurt because all these years I could have talked to him and found out why he did what he did to us and why we were lied to.\u201d\n\nThe family said they did not know of Pearson's passing or the service until reading about it on social media. They then contacted the funeral home in Naples to inform them they were related.\n\nFLORIDA VETERAN WHO DIED WITHOUT KIN IS HONORED BY HUNDREDS OF STRANGERS AT FUNERAL\n\nHoyt, who told the newspaper he did not speak directly to the family himself, said Pearson's kin did not want it made public they existed but approved of the service.\n\n\u201cMr. Pearson died alone. Nobody was able to locate any family members and nobody came forward,\" he told the Sarasota Herald-Tribune in a statement. \"We were contacted late Monday by a family member and they approved the interment at the cemetery and we were informed by the family that no one was going to be attending the service. We wanted to be respectful of the family\u2019s estrangement and we wanted to be respectful to them.\u201d\n\nHoyt told Fox News in an email the funeral home \"made every due diligence effort\" to locate family members, but no one had come forward. Hoyt added that when the story went viral, the funeral home was contacted by one of his sons 12 hours before the scheduled service.\n\n\"He wanted us to know that there was family; and that they would not be in attendance, but we had their blessing to proceed,\" he told Fox News. \"It would have been careless and insensitive for us to announce publicly; at the service, that Mr. Pearson\u2019s two sons had come forward and would not be in attendance.\"\n\nHoyt added that intentions were to \"show respect\" to Pearson and the veteran community.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nLiz Pearson, Edward Pearson Jr.'s wife, said the family found out too late to make arrangements to travel to Sarasota. She told the paper they would have attended if they had known about it sooner.\n\n\"He was deserving of a veteran\u2019s memorial and I don\u2019t want to discount that. But this was also an individual, who, for whatever reason, convinced people he had no one,\" she told the Herald-Tribune. \u201dAt the same time, it is heartwarming to see people honor a veteran they thought had no one. The world needs more of this.\"\n\nFox News' Vandana Rambaran, David Montanaro and Bradford Betz contributed to this report.", "description": "Now\u00a0there are questions surrounding Legacy Options Funeral and Cremation Services\u00a0and whether it misled the thousands who turned up for Pearson's service or, as the funeral home contends, it was informed of the familial connection too late to notify the public.", "authors": ["Travis Fedschun", "Travis Fedschun Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com.
