But thousands of students plan to prove them wrong by boycotting class.\n\nAs the city enters its fourth month of an uprising that has been stunning in both scale and ferocity, students this week are taking center stage. They say if the city\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, doesn\u2019t respond to their demands, they will escalate their actions on Sept. 13.\n\nWhile the summer of dissent has been powered by a vast cross-section of society, it is students and other young people who have been key drivers of near-daily actions across the city.\n\nThe boycott\u2014which is planned at high schools and universities\u2014could galvanize even more students to join the opposition.\n\n\u201cTheir idea is to promote a wider understanding among all students: of the reasons why Hong Kongers are protesting,\u201d said Suzanne Pepper, who studies democracy in the city at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. \u201cStudents are saying there is more to education than just book-learning and formal classroom lectures, so they plan to hold all kinds of activities to explain all that\u2019s going on so people will understand.\u201d\n\nThe Platform of Class Boycotts in Secondary School\u2014an alliance of student and youth activist groups\u2014last month said that in a survey of 19,473 high-school students, a majority of whom were in 10th grade or above, nearly 90% support boycotting classes \u201cto express their concerns on the social injustice and show their determination for democracy in Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nWhat Hong Kong Protesters Want What started off as a demonstration against a controversial extradition bill has become a series of massive protests with broad political demands. Here is why so many Hong Kongers keep taking to the streets in a leaderless movement and whether their goals can be achieved.

They sought to emphasize that they were boycotting classes but not education. A general strike from a cross-section of industries has also been called for Monday and Tuesday.\n\nCurrent and former students stand outside a secondary school in Hong Kong on Monday.

Street occupations ran for 79 days beginning in late September. The first major rally this year\u2014which drew an estimated one million people on June 9\u2014was preceded by a citywide signature-gathering campaign conducted by high school alumni associations.\n\nOver the weekend, the city saw some of its fiercest clashes between protesters and police\u2014a large fire raged near the city\u2019s police headquarters, police shot volleys of tear gas to disperse crowds on Saturday and access to the airport was effectively shut down for several hours on Sunday. Initially ignited by a proposed extradition bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be sent to China for trial\u2014and as the government has made few concessions\u2014it has since become a broader movement. Protesters now want all five of their demands to be met before they step back from the front lines.\n\nIn the last school year, 325,498 students were enrolled at 506 high schools in Hong Kong, according to the city\u2019s education bureau. There were 98,034 students at the city\u2019s eight publicly funded universities, according to the bureau\u2019s data. Hong Kong has a population of about 7.4 million.\n\nSome people are worried that the radical mood on the streets will spill onto campuses.\n\nA lecturer at the Chinese University of Hong Kong said she was concerned about what could happen on campus if boycotters clash with students who don\u2019t support the pro-democracy movement. She says she won\u2019t talk about the movement during class to prevent tensions from rising.\n\n\u201cThe professors and lecturers here, especially the ones from overseas, are also nervous about being in this politically charged environment,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re all very worried. My family back at home is worried about my safety.\u201d\n\nShe expects students to use chairs and desks to block classroom entrances on Monday. Flyers taped to telephone poles around campus remind students of the boycotts. \u201cFive Demands. Not One Less,\u201d it read.\n\nIn a notice seen by The Wall Street Journal that was sent to all academic staff last Monday, the university said classes should run smoothly as scheduled, but it also gave teachers the discretion to cancel or discontinue classes \u201cif under any circumstances the teachers are of the view that classes cannot be conducted/continued in a normal manner.\u201d\n\n\u2014Frances Yoon contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Natasha Khan at natasha.khan@wsj.com", "description": "Officials in Hong Kong had hoped that antigovernment demonstrations would recede after youthful protesters returned to school.
