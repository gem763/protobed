(George Georgiou)\n\nPhoto editor\n\nDiane Arbus, Walker Evans, Stephen Shore, William Eggleston, Robert Adams, Robert Frank. Ever since British photographer George Georgiou began studying the craft when he was 18, he\u2019s been fascinated by the work of legendary photographers who have offered their own takes on America. \u201cThe U.S. is a such a well-documented country,\u201d he told In Sight. \u201cI was particularly taken by the sadly now-late Robert Frank\u2019s \u2018The Americans\u2019 and how he traveled across the states documenting a fractured society in a personal, poetic and, what felt to me, a raw and real way.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s with such inspiration that Georgiou embarked on his own attempt to document the sprawling United States. His images show Americans as they stand on the side of roads across the country, waiting for and watching street parades \u2014 from Independence Day parades to Mardi Gras or Thanksgiving processions.\n\nThe photos will be the subject of an upcoming book, for which Georgiou is raising funds on Kickstarter.\n\n\u201cI have always been interested in looking at the politics of the street and how we use and interact in public,\u201d said Georgiou, whose previous work explored the ever-evolving topography of London\u2019s streets. \u201cThe difficulty in the U.S. is that, in so many towns and cities, the streets have so few people on them, the country is really designed around the car. I would only know a place through its reputation and the state of its architecture; the community was invisible.\u201d\n\nBut when parades take to the streets, that\u2019s when communities come together. \u201cIt becomes visible, and many of the preconceived ideas that you may have of that community disappear,\u201d he added.\n\nGeorgiou was deliberate in his approach, always keeping a certain distance from the crowds while encompassing the environment in his frame to give each image the same weight, he said. \u201cThis was crucial, as I knew there was going to be a lot of people and movement in the image,\u201d he said. That allows for viewers to focus on people\u2019s expressions, how they interact with and behave around each other.\n\nThe result is a series of tableaux, as Georgiou calls them, that tell the stories of these environments and communities, highlighting the economic and racial contexts of each parade as well as modern-day codes of behavior in these groups. \u201cI think that the strength of the work is that we could be looking at ourselves,\u201d he told In Sight. \u201cWe could be in the photos. The anonymity and sheer volume of the different faces blur into a kind of abstract familiarity; in each picture, we find ourselves searching, inadvertently, for somebody we know.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Georgiou\u2019s goal is either noble or naive, depending on the degree of cynicism among his readers. \u201cI want people to be able to look at and recognize each other without fear and prejudice,\u201d he said, admitting that whether he\u2019s successful is something he cannot control. But that\u2019s something many of Georgiou\u2019s renowned peers have had to face, too \u2014 and they\u2019ve proved, like Georgiou\u2019s upcoming book surely will, that there\u2019s still much that can be said about America and its people.\n\n\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. Day parade in Los Angeles on Jan. 18, 2016.
