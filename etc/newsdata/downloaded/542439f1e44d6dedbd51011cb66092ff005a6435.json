Years after her parole, she was jailed for the unpaid court fees.", "language": "en", "text": "Sitting in her jail cell this week, Patricia Spottedcrow couldn\u2019t imagine where she was going to get the money she needed for her release.\n\nIn 2010, the young Oklahoma mother, who had been caught selling $31 worth of marijuana to a police informant after financial troubles caused her to lose her home, was sentenced to 12 years in prison. It was her first-ever offense, and the lengthy sentence drew national attention, sparking a movement that led to her early release.\n\nBut once she was home free, Spottedcrow still owed thousands in court fees that she struggled to pay, since her felony conviction made it difficult to find a job. Notices about overdue payments piled up, with late fees accumulating on top of the original fines. On Monday, the 34-year-old was arrested on a bench warrant that required her to stay in jail until she could come up with $1,139.90 in overdue fees, which she didn\u2019t have. Nearly a decade after her initial arrest, she was still ensnarled in the criminal justice system, and had no idea when she would see her kids again.\n\n\u201cI had no idea how I was going to pay this off,\u201d Spottedcrow told KFOR on Wednesday, after strangers raised the money for her release. \u201cI knew I was going to be sitting here for a while.\u201d\n\nBack in 2011, Spottedcrow became an unwitting poster child for criminal justice reform when the Tulsa World featured her in a series about women incarcerated in Oklahoma. Then 25, she had just entered prison for the first time, and didn\u2019t expect to be reunited with her young children until they were teenagers.\n\nAt the time of her arrest, Spottedcrow was unemployed and without a permanent home, the paper reported. She was staying at her mother\u2019s house in the small town of Kingfisher, O.K. when a police informant showed up and bought an $11 bag of marijuana. Two weeks later, he returned to buy another $20 worth of the drug from Spottedcrow. Both mother and daughter were charged with distribution of a controlled substance, and, because Spottedcrow\u2019s children were at home when the transaction took place, possession of a dangerous substance in the presence of a minor.\n\n\u201cI was home on vacation and it was just there, and I thought we could get some extra money,\u201d Spottedcrow told the paper. \u201cI\u2019ve lost everything because of it.\u201d\n\nThe two women both were offered plea deals that would have netted them only two years in prison, the World reported, but Spottedcrow didn\u2019t want her 50-year-old mother, who has health issues, incarcerated. Since neither had a prior criminal record and they had only sold a small amount of pot, they took their chances and pleaded guilty without negotiating a sentencing agreement, assuming they would be granted probation.\n\nInstead, the judge sentenced Spottedcrow to 10 years in prison for the distribution charge, plus another two years for possession. Her mother received a 30-year suspended sentence so that she could take care of the children. Kingfisher County Associate District Judge Susie Pritchett, who retired not long afterward, told the World she thought the sentence was lenient. The mother-daughter pair had been behind \u201can extensive operation,\u201d she claimed, adding, \u201cIt was a way of life for them.\u201d\n\nSpottedcrow said that wasn\u2019t true. \u201cI\u2019ve never been in trouble, and this is a real eye-opener,\u201d she told the paper at the start of her prison stint. \u201cMy lifestyle is not like this. I\u2019m not coming back. I\u2019m going to get out of here, be with my kids and live my life.\u201d\n\nAfter the World\u2019s story published in 2011, supporters rallied around Spottedcrow\u2019s cause, urging officials to reconsider her punishment. At the time, Oklahoma had the highest per capita rate of female incarceration in the country, a title which it continues to hold today. Advocates contended that lengthy sentences like hers were part of the problem, and questioned whether racial bias could have played a role \u2014 Spottedcrow is part Native American and part African American.\n\nThat same year, a different judge reviewed Spottedcrow\u2019s sentence and agreed to shave off four years. Then, in 2012, then-Gov. Mary Fallin (R) approved her parole. Spottedcrow got home in time to surprise her kids when they stepped off the school bus. The American Civil Liberties Union described her release as a \u201cbittersweet victory,\u201d noting that serving only two years of a 12-year sentence was highly unusual, but the penalty that she received for a first-time, nonviolent drug offense wasn\u2019t out of the ordinary for Oklahoma.\n\nIt also wasn\u2019t the end of her troubles. In 2017, five years after Spottedcrow was released from prison, Ginnie Graham, a columnist for the World, checked into see how she was doing. The picture that she painted was dispiriting: Spottedcrow\u2019s growing family was living in a motel off the interstate because having a felony drug conviction on her record made it virtually impossible for her to find housing, and she hadn\u2019t been able to find work, either.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had Section 8 or HUD, but I need it now,\u201d she said. \u201cI even called my (Cheyenne and Arapahoe) tribe to help, and they didn\u2019t. I called the shelters, and they don\u2019t take large families.\u201d\n\nThat same year, at a forum on criminal justice reform, Spottedcrow explained that she couldn\u2019t go back to working in nursing homes like she had done before her arrest because of her felony conviction. And in a small town like Kingfisher, every other potential employer already knew about her legal woes.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t even go in and act like I feel like I feel good about getting this job, because they already know who I am,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it\u2019s been really hard.\u201d\n\nWhile Spottedcrow struggled to care for her six children, the Kingfisher County Court Clerk\u2019s Office mailed out more than a dozen notices saying she had fallen behind on her payments. Each letter meant that the court had tacked another $10 fine, and that another $80 would be added on top of that if the office didn\u2019t get the money within ten days. When Spottedcrow first reported to prison, she owed $2,740 in fines. After her release, she made payments at least every other month, according to the World. But it barely made impact on her ballooning debt: When she was arrested this week, she owed a total of $3,569.76.\n\n\u201cWe ask folks for years and years to continue to not have any interaction with law enforcement, to pay these fines and fees, and to pay for this supervision,\u201d Nicole Mcafee, the director of policy and advocacy for the ACLU of Oklahoma, told KFOR. \u201cIn a way, we just oftentimes set folks up for failure.\u201d\n\nSpottedcrow\u2019s new arrest on Monday brought renewed attention to her nearly decade-old court case. KFOR morning news anchor Ali Meyer, who detailed the saga in a widely-shared Twitter thread, noted that cannabis has been a booming industry in Oklahoma ever since the state legalized medical marijuana in 2018, and left it up to doctors to determine who qualified.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Meyer posted the number for the Kingfisher County Court Clerk\u2019s Office, which would allow anyone to make payments on Spottedcrow\u2019s behalf. By Wednesday, seven anonymous supporters had covered not just the $1,139.90 that she needed to get out of jail, but her entire $3,569.76 outstanding balance, the station reported.\n\nShe\u2019s out! Patricia Spottedcrow walked out of the Oklahoma Co. Jail today with no court fines hanging over her head. Guys, this is the face of a fresh start. To the generous, compassionate donors.. she says, \u201cThank you for everything!\u201d pic.twitter.com/qaqlMHRtA2 \u2014 Ali Meyer (@amanchor) September 11, 2019\n\nSmiling broadly as she left the Oklahoma City Jail, Spottedcrow thanked the strangers whose donations meant she was finally free.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt feels wonderful. I don\u2019t even know what to say. It just feels really good. I feel like I hit the lotto.\u201d", "description": "Nearly seven years after her parole, Patricia Spottedcrow has struggled to find work and stable housing with a criminal conviction on her record.
