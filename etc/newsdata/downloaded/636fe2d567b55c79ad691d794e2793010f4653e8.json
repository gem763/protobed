United but is nursing a hamstring injury. (Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)\n\nWith the regular season winding down and D.C. United emerging from a summer rut, Ben Olsen is largely done experimenting with players and formations.\n\nExcept in the case of injury or suspension, the lineup and the primary substitutes seem set.\n\nThere is, though, one position worthy of discussion: striker.\n\nOlsen prefers to start one, not two. He is, however, equipped with a pair of proven scorers, Wayne Rooney and Ola Kamara.\n\nSince the latter\u2019s arrival in mid-August, it hasn\u2019t been an issue. Rooney was saddled with injuries and a two-game suspension for a red card.\n\nWhen the Englishman returned for Sunday\u2019s 1-0 victory at Portland, he was supposed to come off the bench and Kamara was slated to start \u2014 a reward for scoring twice at Montreal the previous outing.\n\nOn the eve of the game, however, Kamara\u2019s tight hamstring rendered him unavailable.\n\nThat lingering ailment \u2014 Kamara did not practice in full Wednesday \u2014 will allow Olsen to maintain the status quo Sunday against the Seattle Sounders at Audi Field.\n\nWhen both are healthy, Olsen will have to decide.\n\n\u201cLooking to the future? I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could probably make a guess on what\u2019s next, but we haven\u2019t made any decisions and these are always long weeks.\u201d\n\nGiven the health of the players, it\u2019s Rooney\u2019s job to lose, even though he has gone two months and five matches without a goal.\n\nUnited (12-10-9, 45 points) has struggled in the attack as a whole: Its 40 goals are the fewest among teams currently in the 14 playoff spots and, entering Wednesday\u2019s action, tied for fourth fewest in the 24-team league. The victory at Portland was fueled by a first-half own goal.\n\nSince his fourth game last summer, Rooney has started all but one in which he was available. United signed Kamara before the transfer window closed last month to provide depth this year but mostly to help fill a large void next season: Rooney will cut short his MLS tenure this fall to become a player and assistant coach for Derby County in England\u2019s second flight.\n\nWhile Rooney has not been in top form this year, the blame for United\u2019s ills run deeper: The attack in general has sputtered and ineffective playmaker Luciano Acosta lost his starting job.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure Ben has got different ways to play, whether that is me or Ola up top,\u201d said Rooney, who leads the team in goals (11) and assists (seven). \u201cThat is Ben\u2019s decision. I have to keep trying to be ready to play and be there, whether that means playing [striker] or a deeper position.\u201d\n\nAlong those lines, one thought is to start both Rooney and Kamara, with Rooney as a withdrawn forward or attacking midfielder. But with the playoffs nearing, Olsen is comfortable with the one-forward formation and the accent on defense. (United is fourth in fewest goals conceded and Bill Hamid is second in shutouts with 11.)\n\nRooney and Kamara did start together on the front line Aug. 21 during a 2-1 defeat to the New York Red Bulls. Because of Rooney\u2019s absences, that experiment did not continue.\n\n\u201cWe made that decision a few weeks ago where we said, \u2018Okay, we have to drill down on who we are and who we are going to be,\u2019 \u201d Olsen said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to have a structure with the ball and without the ball that everyone is really well-rehearsed in at this point in the season.\u201d\n\nHe added, though, \u201cThat\u2019s not to say we\u2019re not going to adjust at times throughout the games and to the opponent.\u201d\n\nNotes: United thought it had scored a second goal in Portland, when a deflection appeared to cross the goal line for a two-goal lead. Video assistant referee Ricardo Salazar, however, did not recommend a full review to on-field ref Drew Fischer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not conclusive and it should be conclusive,\u201d Olsen said. \u201cWe have the ability, and the technology is out there to make it conclusive. \u2026 Just got done [watching] U.S. Open tennis; they seem to have it down pretty well.\u201d\n\nGoal differential is the second tiebreaker after total victories and could play a role in deciding home-field advantage in the first round of the playoffs. United entered Wednesday even with fourth-place Toronto on points and victories but behind by two in goal differential. \u2026\n\nForward Quincy Amarikwa missed training Wednesday for personal reasons.\n\nRead more:\n\nU.S. women\u2019s national team star Rose Lavelle cleared to resume full training with Spirit\n\nYamil Asad will rejoin United in January but won\u2019t play for Loudoun United in interim\n\n\u2018I am in your head.
