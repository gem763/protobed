REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nKIEV (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, asked whether U.S. President Donald Trump had put improper pressure on him during a July phone call, said nobody can put pressure on him except his six-year-old son.\n\nDemocrats in the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday launched a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump, accusing him of seeking Ukraine\u2019s help to smear Democratic rival Joe Biden ahead of next year\u2019s election. Trump has dismissed the inquiry as a witch hunt.\n\nThe allegations turn on a July 25 telephone call between Trump and Zelenskiy during which critics allege Trump improperly pressured his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Biden, the former U.S. vice president, and his son Hunter, who had worked for a company drilling for gas in Ukraine.\n\nTrump has said he did nothing wrong and that he\u2019ll release a transcript of the conversation later on Wednesday to prove it.\n\n\u201cNobody can put pressure on me because I am the president of an independent state,\u201d Zelenskiy told Russian reporters in New York where he is attending the United Nations General Assembly.\n\n\u201cThe only one person by the way who can put pressure on me ... is my son, who is six years old,\u201d said Zelenskiy whose comments were broadcast by the Rossiya 24 channel on Wednesday morning ahead of an planned meeting between Zelenskiy and Trump.\n\nAsked whether he would ask Trump for anything when they met, Zelenskiy said:\n\n\u201cAsking for something is not Ukraine\u2019s style. It\u2019s a new strong country and isn\u2019t asking anyone for anything. We can help others ourselves.\u201d\n\nSince the political scandal involving Trump and Ukraine erupted, a trip to the United States that began as a golden opportunity for Kiev to burnish relations with its most powerful international backer has turned into a diplomatic tightrope walk for Zelenskiy.", "description": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, asked whether U.S. President Donald Trump had put improper pressure on him during a July phone call, said nobody can put pressure on him except his six-year-old son.", "authors": ["Matthias Williams", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433722337&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O0JL", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
