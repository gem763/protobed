Mr. Boone had been CSX\u2019s interim CFO since May, stepping in for Frank Lonegro, who had held the role since 2015.\n\nCSX launched an external search for a potential successor to Mr. Lonegro in May, but kept Mr. Boone in the back pocket. Mr. Boone joined CSX as vice president of corporate affairs in 2017 and became vice president of marketing and strategy in March of this year. Before his time at CSX, Mr. Boone worked at Janus Capital Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch. \u201cKevin\u2019s strong and diverse finance background will be invaluable as we strive to operate efficiently and create shareholder value,\u201d Chief Executive Jim Foote said in a release on Wednesday. Alongside Mr. Boone\u2019s appointment, CSX hired Jamie Boychuk as executive vice president of operations. Ed Harris, who previously led operations, will continue as executive vice president, CSX said. Write to Nina Trentmann at Nina.Trentmann@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
