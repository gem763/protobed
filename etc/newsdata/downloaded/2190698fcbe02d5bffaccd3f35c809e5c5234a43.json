KUTV\n\nAuthorities believe the driver swerved on the way to the park on Friday morning. But when he yanked the steering wheel to put the bus back onto the road, the momentum sent the bus into a rollover crash, authorities said.\n\nThe driver, an American citizen, survived and was talking with investigators, Street said. He didn't appear to be intoxicated, but authorities were still investigating his condition as well as any possible mechanical problems, he said.\n\nThe company listed on the bus was America Shengjia Inc. Utah business records indicate it is based in Monterey Park, California. A woman answering the phone there did not have immediate comment.\n\nIntermountain Garfield Memorial Hospital said it received 17 patients, including three in critical condition and 11 in serious condition. Patients also were taken to Cedar City and St. George hospitals.\n\nMillions of people visit Utah's five national parks every year. Last year, about 87,000 people from China visited the state, making them the fastest-growing group of Utah tourists, according to state data.\n\nMore than half of visitors from China travel on tour buses, said Vicki Varela, managing director of Utah Office of Tourism.\n\nThe Chinese Embassy tweeted that it was saddened to hear about the crash and that it was sending staff to help the victims.\n\n\"You have a group from China who have worked hard to come to the states, got the visa and everything they needed, excited about it, and for a tragedy like this to happen it just makes it all the more tragic,\" Street said.", "description": "All 31 people on board were hurt, with 12 to 15 considered to be in critical condition shortly after the crash; several have since improved", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/22/708cac51-99b2-4b0d-a22d-acb86bf2ffd7/thumbnail/1200x630/fc485420d149991f12c9f300e0a41491/south-utah-bus-crash-2019-09-22-a.png", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
