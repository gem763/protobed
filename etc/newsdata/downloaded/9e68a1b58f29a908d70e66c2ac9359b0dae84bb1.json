And: Gary Younge on Donald Trump\u2019s mental health\n\nThe Guardian\u2019s global environment editor, Jonathan Watts, tells Anushka Asthana about the polluters series, which identified 20 fossil fuel companies whose relentless exploitation of the world\u2019s oil, gas and coal reserves can be directly linked to more than one-third of all greenhouse gas emissions in the modern era.\n\nThe project shows many of the worst offenders are investor-owned companies that are household names around the world and spend billions of pounds on lobbying governments and portraying themselves as environmentally responsible. They discuss the systemic changes that would need to take place to change the way the world produces and uses fossil fuels.\n\nAnd: Gary Younge on the mental health of US president Donald Trump", "description": "Global environment editor Jonathan Watts discusses the Guardian\u2019s investigation into the fossil fuel industry, and the structures that need to change to halt the climate emergency.
