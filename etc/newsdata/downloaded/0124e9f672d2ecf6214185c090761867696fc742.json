But West has always been making worship music, both in his literal embrace of religious themes and iconography, and also in his belief that songs should be a vehicle for moral tugs of war, philosophical reckoning and ecstatic praise. The only thing that has changed is the packaging.\n\n\u201cJesus Is King,\u201d his ninth album, released last week after a string of delays, is very much of the West oeuvre. A more engaged and vivid album than \u201cYe,\u201d from last year, though nowhere as robust as \u201cThe Life of Pablo\u201d from 2016, it is bare-bones and curiously effective, emotionally forceful and structurally scant. It has the scent of haste, and also of urgency \u2014 these songs work familiar West turf, but with almost no filigree beyond faith.\n\nSince 2008, when he deconstructed his bluster on \u201c808s & Heartbreak,\u201d but particularly since the tectonic, industrial shift of \u201cYeezus\u201d in 2013, West has made texture his palette far more than rhyme, subject matter or melody. His verses have gotten terser and snarlier (and he has spoken of not always writing them himself), and his best songs work primarily on visceral, nontextual levels.\n\nThe result is \u201cYeezus\u201d for Jesus, packed with hard sonic jolts. West understands the weapons-grade power of a gospel choir, and deploys it from the album\u2019s opener, \u201cEvery Hour\u201d \u2014 quite simply, a ringing alarm clock shaking off the fatigue of the last couple of years.", "description": "On \u201cJesus Is King,\u201d his ninth album, the rapper turns to gospel music, suggesting a shift in his public image that\u2019s actually not much of a change at all.", "authors": ["Jon Caramanica"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/27/arts/27kanye/27kanye-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
