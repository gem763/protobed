And after a five-month investigation, she has now caught the alleged culprit; an account belonging to her fellow footballer\u2019s wife Rebekah Vardy.\n\nShe announced the findings of her inquiry pn Wednesday morning, prompting a huge reaction. Netflix promised to make a documentary on the saga, while Conservative MPs praised her ability to flush out nuisance leakers.\n\nTonight international trade secretary Liz Truss waded into the debate.\n\nShe said: \"There has been a massive fallout between some very influential people figures in our country that has divided the nation.\n\n\"There has been finger-pointing, there has been blame-shifting and there has been denials.
