It happened to Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair\u2019s communications director, in the fall-out from the Iraq War.\n\nMany at Westminster think the same fate will befall Dominic Cummings, the man they regard as the \u201cevil genius\u201d behind Boris Johnson\u2019s divisive and intemperate language in the Commons this week, and Johnson\u2019s \u201cdo or die\u201d strategy to leave the EU on 31 October.\n\nBut so far, Cummings has defied the rule that advisers should be seen but not heard. When Labour MP Karl Turner confronted him about death threats he had received, Cummings told him: \u201cGet Brexit done.\u201d Speaking at a book launch, the former Vote Leave campaign director said it was \u201cnot surprising that some people are angry\u201d about the Brexit delay, and found it \u201codd\u201d that the MPs who caused the impasse were surprised by it. (No concession to MPs\u2019 right to exercise their judgement to prevent an act of economic self-harm).\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIn a typically aggressive, super-confident line, Cummings reassured Brexiteers: \u201cThe referendum was pressure, the referendum was difficult. This is a walk in the park compared to that. All the Vote Leave team, we are enjoying this, we are going to win, we are going to leave, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\n\nThis is what admirers call \u201cclassic Dom\u201d: he is very good at winding up his opponents, who often walk into his traps, like his referendum claim that Brexit would mean an extra \u00a3350m a week for the NHS. In attacking the false (gross) figure, the Remain camp magnified it. He is doing it again now by rebranding the Benn Act, which forces Boris Johnson to seek an extension of the UK\u2019s EU membership if there is no deal, as the Surrender Act. The new version of the 2016 \u201ctake back control\u201d slogan is \u201cget Brexit done\u201d \u2013 the theme of the upcoming Tory conference in Manchester.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

If that means stoking anti-politics and a battle with parliament or the Supreme Court, then the ends justify the means. There were calls for him to be fired after this week\u2019s devastating ruling that Johnson acted unlawfully by suspending parliament for five weeks.\n\nBut Cummings does not play by the rules: he makes them up as he goes along. He is clever at positioning Johnson into \u201cwin/win situations\u201d. So judges will be bracketed with MPs in a \u201cpeople versus establishment\u201d election. Another court battle looks inevitable when Johnson tries to wriggle out of the Benn Act\u2019s straitjacket.\n\nMacho politics can work for a while but sometimes enemies get their revenge. When Cummings worked as special adviser to former education secretary Michael Gove, they took on another establishment \u2013 the education world, dubbed \u201cthe blob\u201d. David Cameron liked their reforms but not Cummings\u2019 \u201cabrasive and aggressive edge\u201d. Gove so alienated teachers and parents that he was demoted to chief whip against his wishes. In his memoirs, Cameron describes Cummings and Nigel Farage as having \u201csomething of the night about them\u201d and being part of a \u201ccauldron of toxicity\u201d.\n\nWill macho politics get Brexit over the line or will the Cummings approach alienate so many people that it self-destructs? Johnson is convinced the \u201cSurrender Act\u201d rhetoric hurts Corbyn. But it raises a \u201cchicken and egg\u201d question: are Brexiteers fuelling the \u201canger\u201d in the country with such language or merely reflecting the anger that already exists? I suspect the former, though they will claim the latter.\n\nIt\u2019s a high-risk strategy. Johnson had the \u201cget it done\u201d and \u201cSurrender Act\u201d lines in his head when he faced MPs on Wednesday. But he overstepped the mark by saying the best way to honour the murdered Labour MP Jo Cox was to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. He was also wrong to dismiss as \u201chumbug\u201d the fears of woman MPs about threats of violence.\n\nI suspect this episode will enhance Johnson\u2019s problem with female voters. YouGov found that he has a worse \u201cfavourability rating\u201d among women (a net minus 25 points) than men (minus 17). Women are much less likely than men to support no deal.\n\nLike Donald Trump, Johnson is playing to his base. The calculation is probably that he can win a Commons majority with 35 per cent of the votes because the opposition parties are divided. This is one reason Johnson does not want a Final Say referendum requiring 51 per cent, despite Cummings\u2019 confidence about winning it with a \u201ctell them again\u201d message. The Liberal Democrats\u2019 revival helps the Tories if they take Remain votes away from Labour in Con-Lab marginals. However, if the Lib Dems achieved real lift off, they could scupper this strategy by winning more Tory seats.\n\nThe other danger in what Sir John Major called \u201cthe language of division and hate\u201d is that Johnson trashes his own brand as a One Nation, liberal Conservative. Brexiteers might not mind the Tories becoming the nasty party again, but it might just provoke Remainers into the anti-Tory tactical voting that could still wreck the Johnson-Cummings strategy. And then the beneficiary would be the last person Johnson wants to help\u2026 Corbyn.", "description": "Normally, when a backroom political adviser goes front of house and steals the show\u00a0it ends in tears.
