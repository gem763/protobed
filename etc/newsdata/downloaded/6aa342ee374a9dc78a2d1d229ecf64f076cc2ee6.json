Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court confirmation hearings last year, a Democratic senator wrote to the director of the F.B.I. saying he had \u201cinformation relevant\u201d to the inquiry, but the bureau apparently failed to follow up.\n\nThe letter, sent early last October by Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, to Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, has come to light after a book by two New York Times reporters surfaced a new allegation of sexual impropriety by Mr. Kavanaugh. The events have reopened the bitter partisan debate over the confirmation of Justice Kavanaugh, just as he is coming up on his first anniversary on the Supreme Court.\n\nIn the letter, Mr. Coons told Mr. Wray that several people had come to him with information about the future justice. In particular, he asked Mr. Wray for \u201cappropriate follow-up\u201d with a former Yale classmate of Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s, who had information that might have buttressed a claim by another classmate, Deborah Ramirez, that Mr. Kavanaugh exposed himself to her during a drunken dormitory party in 1983, their freshman year.", "description": "A Democratic senator expressed concern last year that the F.B.I. was not following up on allegations against the Supreme Court nominee.", "authors": ["Sheryl Gay Stolberg"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/16/us/politics/16dc-coons1-promo/16dc-coons1-promo-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
