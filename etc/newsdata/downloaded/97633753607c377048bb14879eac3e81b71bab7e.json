She has regularly ordered ice cream when eating there.\n\nShe said: \"I'm a nice person and I don't behave angrily in any way shape or form.\n\n(Image: Solent News & Photo Agency)\n\n\"I complained because for some unknown reason they were giving out short measures. Now I feel like I've been belittled and treated like I'm nothing.\n\n\"It has made me really shaky and upset, I've lost my confidence.\"\n\nMs Simms said she and friend Michael Duval, who visited the restaurant together regularly, were told they cannot return again until she apologises.\n\nBut Ms Simms has said she will not bow to pressure, instead vowing to take the complaint further.\n\n(Image: Portsmouth News/Solent News)\n\nShe said: \"I don't know what I'd be saying sorry for - I've done nothing wrong.\n\n\"They go on about having a duty of care for their staff, but what about their customers? If I went round smashing windows I could understand, but I'm an old lady.\"\n\nA Burger King spokeswoman said they would be happy to talk through the issue with Ms Simms.\n\nShe said: \"Providing a superior guest experience is a top priority at Burger King restaurants, however equally we expect our crew members to be treated with respect.\n\n\"On this occasion, our staff felt uncomfortable with Ms Simms behaviour.\n\n\"We'd be happy to discuss this further with Susan, as per our response to her complaint, so we can reach an agreement and welcome her back.\"", "description": "Susan Simms, 64, was told not to return after her complaint about the \u00a31.29 pot she was served", "authors": ["Paul Slack", "Image", "Portsmouth News Solent News", "Solent News", "Photo Agency"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20546979.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_sdsdsf.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
