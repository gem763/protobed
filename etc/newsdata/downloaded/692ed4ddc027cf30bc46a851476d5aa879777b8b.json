They got in touch, and Kelble says they agreed on a rate of $800.\n\nHayley and Nick got engaged at the Cincinnati Zoo with a viral photo featuring Fiona the Hippo. Courtesy of Hayley Kelble\n\n\"I had asked her about a contract, because everyone else I had contacted wanted to do a contract right away before anything was settled. She said 'No, we don't really need to do that.' That was kind of the first red flag,\" she said.\n\nThe day of the wedding, Kelble says the photographer didn't use her flash in the dim church setting or provide adequate direction for poses. She also says that the photographer left two and a half hours earlier than they had planned.\n\n\"We moved things around so that she could get pictures of us cutting the cake and stuff before she left,\" Hayley said. \"She stayed for like 20 minutes of the reception and left.\"\n\nAfter the wedding, Kelble says that the photographer then cashed the $800 check before sending her all of the pictures. The first few she'd sent looked nice, but Kelble was shocked when she saw the rest.\n\nThe photos appeared dark, blurry, and underexposed\n\nOne of the wedding photos they received.

Courtesy of Hayley Kelble\n\n\"The images were so underexposed that they were just grainy and blurry. I didn't know what to do. I was like, I don't want to pay for these.\"\n\nThe outdoor photos also came out dark and blurry.

Here's her advice:\n\nDo your research. It's okay to ask friends for their recommendations, but don't just take their word for it. \"Even if you trust who's referring, make sure you research reviews on websites like TheKnot.com, WeddingWire.com, and Yelp,\" Jacobs said.\n\nIt's okay to ask friends for their recommendations, but don't just take their word for it. \"Even if you trust who's referring, make sure you research reviews on websites like TheKnot.com, WeddingWire.com, and Yelp,\" Jacobs said. Set up in-person meetings. Skype or FaceTime calls can also be helpful in determining whether or not the photographer is a good fit. \"So much of the photography relationship is based on chemistry and personality,\" she said. \"Ask lots of questions to gauge if their style meets your wants.\"\n\nSkype or FaceTime calls can also be helpful in determining whether or not the photographer is a good fit. \"So much of the photography relationship is based on chemistry and personality,\" she said. \"Ask lots of questions to gauge if their style meets your wants.\" Get everything in writing. If a photographer says you don't need a contract, don't use them. \"Contracts are the only sure bet that your vendor can be held accountable for your agreement,\" she said. \"Make sure your expectations and package are clearly spelled out: number of hours, number of shooters, number of images and prints, albums, and what happens in the event there is a dispute.\"\n\nIf a photographer says you don't need a contract, don't use them. \"Contracts are the only sure bet that your vendor can be held accountable for your agreement,\" she said. \"Make sure your expectations and package are clearly spelled out: number of hours, number of shooters, number of images and prints, albums, and what happens in the event there is a dispute.\" Do an engagement shoot. \"An engagement shoot is fun! But it's also a great opportunity to test the waters with your photographer beforehand,\" Jacobs said.\n\nKelble is happy with the pictures she has now, but wants other couples to know that an experienced photographer is worth the steeper price.\n\nHayley and Nick. Phil Koehler Photography/Courtesy of Hayley Kelble\n\n\"Do your research and spend more than you think you should, because that's all you're going to have of memories of that day,\" she said. \"It doesn't matter how much you spent on the actual day, you're not going to have memories of it if you don't spend good money to hire someone to take those pictures.\"", "description": "A couple's wedding photos came out blurry, grainy, and underexposed.
