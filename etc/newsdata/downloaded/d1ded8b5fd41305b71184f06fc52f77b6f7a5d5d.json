REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\n\nThe two ride-hailing companies had been asked to appear as part of a House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee inquiry on safety and labor practices as lawmakers seek to prepare legislation that will impact the industry.\n\n\u201cTheir failure to appear at this hearing is a telling sign that they would rather suffer a public lashing than answer questions on the record about their operations,\u201d the head of the panel, U.S. Representative Peter DeFazio, a Democrat, said in his prepared remarks.\n\nDeFazio added that the hearing \u201cshould also serve also a wake-up call to the companies that have flooded our roadways with disruptive technologies and investor capital that their days of operating with little public policy and regulatory oversight in the transportation space are coming to an end.\u201d\n\nHe raised a number of issues, from safety to congestion to wages of drivers.\n\n\u201cPerhaps they don\u2019t want to talk about what their model is doing to drive down wages and turn our transportation workforce from a skilled, trained pool of workers earning living wages to another casualty of the gig economy,\u201d DeFazio said.\n\nEarlier this week, he urged the companies\u2019 chief executives in a letter to participate in the inquiry even as Uber and Lyft directed lawmakers to third-party industry associations.\n\nDeFazio added \u201cthe tenuous existence of Uber and Lyft is literally fueled by millions of independent contractors who see their take home pay reduced drastically \u2013 below minimum wage in some states - as they are made to pay fees collected by the company, self-employment taxes, and costs associated with operating and maintaining their vehicles.\u201d\n\nHe said the companies, which have reported substantial losses, \u201cdon\u2019t make information about their process for deactivating dangerous drivers public. They don\u2019t share data on the prevalence of assaults on their platforms. They don\u2019t reveal details on how drivers are paid. What we do know is that both these companies are struggling since going public... Clearly, this business model is not sustainable.\n\nUber on Monday confirmed it had received DeFazio\u2019s request.\n\nLyft said this week it would work with lawmakers and said the committee is reviewing \u201cimportant topics that we take very seriously. We look forward to future discussions.\u201d\n\nThe companies did not immediately comment Wednesday.", "description": "Uber Technologies Inc and Lyft Inc declined to appear on Wednesday at a U.S. House of Representatives hearing on issues relating to the ride-hailing industry, a congressional committee said.", "authors": ["David Shepardson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441458121&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F0YA", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
