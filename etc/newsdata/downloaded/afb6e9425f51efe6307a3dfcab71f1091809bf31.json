Square, run by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, will also let customers trade fractions of a stock so investors can buy a portion of more expensive names like Amazon. For example, Dorsey said on Twitter that users can buy $1 worth of a stock like Berkshire Hathaway class A shares, which were trading at more than $315,000 Thursday.\n\n\"Really proud of the team for making buying stocks and building wealth accessible to more people,\" Dorsey said on Twitter Thursday.\n\nThe new offer pegs Square against Robinhood, which has attracted a $7.6 billion valuation and more than 6 million users with a zero-fee stock trading model. Robinhood was followed by a wave of incumbents like Charles Schwab and Fidelity cutting fees to zero in October.", "description": "Square is launching stock trading on its Cash App.", "authors": ["Kate Rooney"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105817798-1553713493573gettyimages-1091906160.jpeg?v=1556025866", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
