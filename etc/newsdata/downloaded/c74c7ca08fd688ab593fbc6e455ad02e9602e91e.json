Obscure benefit revealed", "language": "en", "text": "A little-known rule means women who paid the 'married women's stamp' towards the state pension can still benefit from it now, says a former minister.\n\nWomen retiring from April 2016 onwards get state pension payments based on their own National Insurance record not their husband's.\n\nBut there is a special concession for those who paid the stamp for at least one year during the 35 years before they reached state pension age.\n\nYou can still claim \u00a377.45 a week if still married and \u00a3129.20 if you are widowed or divorced, according to Steve Webb, a former Pensions Minister who is now policy director at Royal London.\n\nMarried women's stamp: Until April 1977, married women could choose to pay a reduced rate of National Insurance in the expectation of claiming on their husband's record\n\nWomen who paid the stamp and are getting less than this in state pension should contact the Government's Pension Centre to see if they are entitled to a higher amount, he says.\n\nBut you will not qualify for any second state pension based on earnings on top of that, as this was not permitted under the old married women's stamp system, explains Webb.\n\nUntil April 1977, married women could choose to pay a reduced rate of National Insurance in the expectation of claiming on their husband's record in retirement, on the now outdated assumption a man would be the main earner in a couple.\n\nThe lower rate was 5.85 per cent of weekly earnings between \u00a3166.01 and \u00a3962, and women who opted in before it was abolished have been allowed to continue paying it for as long as they kept working, with gaps of no more than two years at a time.\n\nWebb has discovered via a Freedom of Information request that 200 women are still paying the stamp today, even though it started to be phased out decades ago.\n\nHowever, the number will dwindle to none by 2027 when all the women concerned have reached state pension age.\n\n'Although only a small number of married women are still paying the reduced rate, many millions of women have done so at some point in their working life,' he says.\n\n'Prior to 6 April 2016, women could claim a partial state pension based on the NI record of their husband. But the new state pension system is based on an individual\u2019s own record of NI contributions, not those of their spouse.\n\n'When the system changed, this could have disadvantaged women who were expecting to claim based on their husband\u2019s record but suddenly could not do so.\n\n'As a result, the Government introduced a little-noticed concession which allows any woman reaching state pension under the new rules and who paid the married woman\u2019s stamp at any point in the 35 years before reaching pension age to make a claim based on her husband\u2019s NI record.'\n\nAt its peak, 4.4million women were paying the married women's stamp.\n\nAlthough it might now help some women, Webb, who is This is Money's pensions agony uncle, has previously pointed out there were also downsides to paying the stamp, and many ended up with reduced state pension rights.\n\n'One of the controversies about the married woman\u2019s stamp is that whilst some women made a well informed choice \u2013 pay less NI contributions now but get less pension later \u2013 many women report that they don\u2019t even recall signing to pay the reduced rate and had a nasty shock when they got their pension,' he wrote in his column in reply to a reader.\n\n'If such an option were given today, there would be much tighter rules around information and guidance before making such a far-reaching decision, but back in the 1960s and 1970s it seems to have been almost automatic in some workplaces.'\n\n'Another consequence of paying the married woman\u2019s stamp is that the protection for years at home spent bringing up children was affected. The rules are complex, but essentially if you were paying the married woman\u2019s stamp, some of your time at home with children may not count towards your final pension.'\n\nThe Government has estimated that around 10,000 women could potentially benefit from the special concession described above, introduced in 2016 to make provision for them when the right to claim on their husband's record was abolished.\n\nWebb adds: 'It is amazing that in designing a state pension system in the 21st Century, the Government had to include special rules to protect women affected by a rule designed in the 1940s.\n\n'If any woman is getting a substantially reduced amount from the new state pension she should check if she paid the reduced stamp and contact the Pension Service if she is in any doubt.'", "description": "Women retiring from April 2016 onwards get payments based on their own NI record not their husband's - but there is a special concession for those who paid the stamp for at least one year.", "authors": ["Tanya Jefferies For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
