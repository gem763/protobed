Look, I wouldn\u2019t write off the Wallabies here. They\u2019ve exhibited flashes of genuine polish at this World Cup \u2026 but only flashes.\n\nThe Aussies were also responsible for that hugely eye-opening 47-26 Rugby Championship victory over the All Blacks in Perth this year, only to show their schizophrenic tendencies by crashing 0-36 a week later in the Bledisloe Cup \u201cextra\u201d game in Auckland.\n\nEngland have been less than an outright excitement machine at RWC so far, yet still maintained their patience and structure sufficiently to earn extremely comfortable, professional wins against all of Argentina, the USA and Tonga \u2013 often a sign of \u201cknockout pressure\u201d strength and fortitude.\n\nI believe they will muscle their way past this obstacle, bringing the bilateral win record in history exactly level at 25-25 and simply extending the record \u2013 to seven \u2013 for consecutive victories by either of these foes over the other. Aussie-born England mastermind Eddie Jones\u2019s charges have been on a six-wins streak against the Wallabies since June 2016, including easy triumphs in each of the last two encounters at Twickenham (30-6 in 2017, 37-18 in 2018).\n\nThat said, perhaps working slightly in Wallaby favour will be the cancellation of England\u2019s anticipated final pool match against the old enemy from the across the Channel, France, which would have primed them usefully for this clash.\n\nNew Zealand v Ireland, Saturday, 12:15 SA time\n\nMy gut feel: New Zealand. Expect the All Blacks to come out of this mouth-watering tussle substantially bruised \u2026 but yes, unbowed.\n\nIreland have enough blue-chip individual names in their ranks (very much including their SA-born loose forward dynamo CJ Stander) to be well capable of what would only go down as a relative upset.\n\nBut I also suspect that the Irish -- like their hallowed opponents are quite widely perceived to be -- are retreating from a recent peak of their own, and some of their heftier specimens haven\u2019t appeared to be enjoying the sticky, draining conditions in Japan (very different to the Emerald Isle in the heart of rugby season there).\n\nFor collective athleticism, something the defending champions usually have in bag-loads anyway, NZ should crucially rule the roost in this one, even if some of their more stalwart troops haven\u2019t had much of gallop so far at the event because of the typhoon-related call-off of the Italy match.\n\nThe All Blacks have an enormous historical supremacy (28-2, one draw) although a defiant Irish counter would be that those two triumphs (Chicago 2016, Dublin 2018) come amidst the last three encounters!\n\nWales v France, Sunday, 09:15 SA time\n\nMy gut feel: Wales. While France are traditionally one of those moody, \u201cyou just never know\u201d type of teams, the men in scarlet should prove too wily.\n\nLes Bleus \u2013 conveniently, you might argue \u2013 avoided tackling England in group play due to the lethal weather issues, ensuring an unbeaten RWC sequence of 3/3 heading into this date with the defending Six Nations title-holders.\n\nBut two of them were real skin-of-the-teeth conquests \u2013 23-21 against each of Argentina and Tonga \u2013 which seemed to suggest France aren\u2019t a resurgent force in global rugby yet.\n\nMeanwhile the Welsh have gone about their business just a bit beneath the radar, it has seemed, despite topping their pool with a 100 percent record, including that vital 29-25 edging out of Australia: are they being just a little under-estimated in Japan? If so, it may be suiting them just fine.\n\nWales have a 50-44 dominance bilaterally, including clinching seven of the last eight encounters (the last a 24-19 triumph in France\u2019s Parisian stronghold in the 2019 Six Nations).\n\nIn French favour, perhaps, is their 2-0 mastery of the neutral-ground duels: an incredible 51-0 result at London\u2019s Wembley Stadium in the 1998 then-Five Nations, plus 9-8 victory in the semi-final of RWC 2011 at Auckland.\n\nSouth Africa v Japan, Sunday, 12:15 SA time\n\nMy gut feel: South Africa. Most of the reasons for my confident suggestion that the Boks will finally leap out into a 2-1 lead in the modest history between these countries are documented in some detail right here:\n\n*Follow our chief writer on Twitter: @RobHouwing", "description": "<strong>Rob Houwing</strong> runs the rule, albeit minus the specific line-ups yet, over the RWC 2019 quarter-finals and how he expects them to turn out \u2026", "authors": ["Rob Houwing", "Chief Writer"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7832/10661bc4dcbc451e94026475bca92568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
