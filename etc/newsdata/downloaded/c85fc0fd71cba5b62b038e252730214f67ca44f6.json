Nicholas Heras, a fellow at the Centre for a New American Security think and former outside adviser to the US military, called the Turkish campaign a \u201cboon to Isis\u201d.\n\n\u201cIsis has been under intense pressure from the SDF, which focused on breaking up Isis sleeper cells. Counter-Isis operations require significant amounts of intelligence and focus, which Turkey\u2019s campaign is disrupting,\u201d he told The Independent.\n\nBut the threat of sleeper cells is less of a concern than the possibility of a mass breakout by Isis from the SDF\u2019s makeshift jails. Kurdish officials have repeatedly sounded the alarm about the danger of such an event, and did so again on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThis attack will definitely reduce and weaken the guarding system for those Daesh [Isis] militants in the prisons,\u201d said Badran Jia Kurd, an adviser to the SDF-affiliated civil authority in northeast Syria.\n\n\u201cThis could lead to their escape or to behaviours that may get out of the control of the security forces. The number of forces guarding the prisons is reduced the more the battles intensify. This poses a grave danger,\u201d he told Reuters.\n\nThe SDF is currently holding some 12,000 captured Isis fighters, of whom around 1,000 are from European countries. Most were captured in the dying days of the Isis caliphate, the last remnants of which were destroyed by the SDF with US backing.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

European countries do not want their citizens to return, fearing they would be difficult to convict and might later carry out attacks. The SDF lacks a functioning justice system to try the rest.\n\nEuropean inaction on the issue has angered Donald Trump. In announcing his tacit support for the Turkish offensive into Syria, the US president suggested that Turkey would take custody of the Isis prisoners. But in the chaos of a conflict between the two sides, it is unclear how the transfer of prisoners would work.\n\nTurkey has vowed to handle any Isis prisoners it inherits and battle any fighters it confronts. But analysts have suggested this is a cynical evasion. Turkey\u2019s main goal is to establish a buffer zone between itself and the Kurdish self-rule experiment and cut off the YPG from direct contact with its own Kurdish population.\n\nSelim Sazak, of Brown University, US, said Turkey likely hopes to avoid any contact with Isis.\n\n\u201cTurks are already spinning this,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re saying, \u2018We will be fully responsible for any Isis in the territories that come under control.\u2019 Of course, there are none. Maybe just that camp at Hasaka, but that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nThe threat of a mass prison break was heightened following the release of an audio message from Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi last month.\n\n\u201cAs for the worst and most important matter \u2014 the prisons, the prisons, oh soldiers of the caliphate,\u201d Baghdadi said. \u201cYour brothers and sisters, do your utmost to free them and tear down the walls restricting them.\n\nMr Heras said that a prolonged Turkish offensive risks leaving the prisons open to attack.\n\n\u201cIsis, in its previous life as al-Qaeda in Iraq, relied on prison breaks freeing its operatives to replenish its ranks. That would be the same playbook Isis would want to follow in Syria, and Turkey could help Isis a lot to enact its playbook,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked on Wednesday about the possibility of a breakout amid the fighting, Mr Trump appeared unconcerned.\n\n\u201cWell they\u2019re going to be escaping to Europe, that\u2019s where they want to go, they want to go back to their homes. But Europe didn\u2019t want them from us. We could have given it to them, they could have trials, they could have done whatever they wanted,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite the president\u2019s flippant remarks, the US appeared to be was concerned enough about security to take action. On Wednesday, US officials took dozens of high-value Isis detainees from SDF prisons into their custody at a more secure location. Among those moved were El Shafee Elsheikh and Alexanda Kotey, two British Isis members suspected of involvement in the executions of numerous hostages.\n\nThe transfer was taken as a sign that at least some within the Trump administration were concerned about the security of the installation.\n\n\u201cThe US decision to move some of the most hardened Isis prisoners out of Syria underscores just how volatile this situation has become,\u201d says Shiraz Maher, director of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King\u2019s College London.\n\n\u201cThe leader of Isis, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, recently called on his supporters to free these very prisoners. As the Kurds now relocate forces to counter a Turkish invasion in the north, these detention facilities will inevitably become even more vulnerable and exposed.\u201d\n\nBut it isn\u2019t just the prisons holding captured Isis fighters that have worried US and Kurdish forces. Even before the threat of a Turkish incursion was apparent, the SDF warned that it was struggling to maintain control over the al-Hol camp, a facility holding some 70,000 Isis family members \u2013 most of them women and children, and many of them still loyal to the group.\n\nThe camp residents have been increasingly volatile in recent weeks. Camp authorities have reported a number of attacks against guards, rioting and even the murder of a young man who reportedly fell foul of a group of hardcore Isis sympathisers.\n\nOn Thursday, the al-Hol military council \u2013 made up of fighters from the town where the camp is located, who would likely be called upon to defend it in the face of an attack \u2013 announced they would be deploying their forces to the border to repel the Turkish attack.\n\nThe SDF recently described the camp as a \u201cticking time bomb\u201d, adding that guns and other weapons had been smuggled inside the camp.\n\nThere are thought to be at least 19 British women currently at Hol, and camps Roj and Ain Issa, together with at least 30 of their children. Shamima Begum had previously stayed at the camp before being moved.\n\nAlthough al-Hol has been relatively calm in the past few days, camp officials are reportedly prepared for more trouble. The next time riots break out, however, they may have less hands to deal with it.", "description": "In the days and weeks leading up to Turkey\u2019s military offensive in Syria, the Kurdish militia set to be at the receiving end of the operation issued a stark warning to the international community: If we are attacked, Isis will return.", "authors": ["Richard Hall", "Borzou Daragahi"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/10/17/gettyimages-1126762808.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
