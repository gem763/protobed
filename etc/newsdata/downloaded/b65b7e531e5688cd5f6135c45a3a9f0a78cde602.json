U.S. stock futures gained 0.44%, paring most of Friday's 0.53% fall in the index.\n\nTrading in Chinese markets was quiet ahead of a long break. Chinese share markets will trade only on Monday this week ahead of the country's National Day holiday, which runs until Oct. 7.\n\nThere were mixed signals from China's manufacturing surveys on Monday, which showed sustained weakness in exports and surprising improvement in domestic consumption indicators, and a Chinese central bank statement briefly hinting at plans for more stimulative policies.\n\nChina's yuan was little moved at 7.1192 yuan per dollar, while the offshore yuan rallied a bit from Friday's three-week low of 7.1520.\n\nThe delisting of Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges was part of a broader effort to limit U.S. investment in Chinese companies, two sources briefed on the matter told Reuters.\n\nA U.S. Treasury official said the United States does not currently plan to stop Chinese companies from listing on U.S. exchanges, Bloomberg reported on Saturday.\n\n\"While China runs a current account surplus and is a net creditor nation, Chinese companies are net debtors and rely on foreign capital,\" Koji Fukaya, president of Office Fukaya Consulting.\n\n\"Washington seems to be trying to limit Chinese companies' activities by putting pressure on their funding,\" he said.\n\nStill, with trade talks between the United States and China expected to be held Oct. 10-11, many market players are hoping such drastic measures on capital markets will be avoided.\n\n\"At this point, markets will have to wait and see. Of course we need to be guarded against more crazy headlines, but this week could be a bit calmer given holidays in China. Economic data will likely be the main driver for markets,\" said Kyosuke Suzuki, director of forex at Societe Generale.\n\nU.S. data on Friday showed consumer spending barely rose in August and business investment remained weak, suggesting the American economy was losing momentum as the trade dispute drags on.\n\nIndustrial output in Japan and South Korea, released Monday morning, dropped more than expected, underscoring the headwinds from the trade war.\n\nInvestors are also keeping a wary eye on U.S. politics.\n\nU.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said public opinion is now on the side of an impeachment inquiry against Trump following the release of new information about his conversations with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nMajor currencies were little changed in early trade.\n\nThe yen traded flat at 107.94 yen.\n\nThe euro hovered around $1.0932, having sunk to a 28-month low of $1.0904 on Friday as concerns about tepid growth in Europe weighed on the common currency.\n\nSterling traded at $1.2285, not far from Friday's low of $1.2270, its lowest since Sept. 9.\n\nBoris Johnson said on Sunday he would not quit as Britain's prime minister even if he fails to secure a deal to leave the European Union, insisting only his Conservative government can deliver Brexit on Oct. 31.\n\nOil prices slightly rebounded after last week's slide.\n\nSaudi Arabia's crown prince warned in an interview with CBS program \"60 Minutes\" aired on Sunday that crude prices could spike to \"unimaginably high numbers\" if the world does not come together to deter Iran.\n\nBut Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said he would prefer a political solution to a military one, adding the Sept. 14 attacks on the kingdom's oil facilities were an act of war by Iran.\n\nBrent crude futures rose 0.05% to $6.94 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude gained 0.25% to $56.05 per barrel.
