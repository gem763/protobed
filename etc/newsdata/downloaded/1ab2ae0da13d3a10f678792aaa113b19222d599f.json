The landfall officially tied Dorian with the decades-old record held by the 1935 Labor Day hurricane for the strongest winds of any storm to hit land. The slowly encroaching Hurricane was moved to Category 5 on Sunday\u2014the highest category on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale, which classifies hurricanes based off of sustained wind speed.\n\nWith just 205 miles between Dorian and the Florida coastline, President Trump made the declaration on Twitter on Sunday that 2019\u2019s Labor Day storm \u201cis looking like one of the largest hurricanes ever.\u201d Later in the day, South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster (R) ordered a mandatory evacuation of the state\u2019s entire coastline in the possibility that Dorian sweeps northward on Wednesday.\n\nPhil Klotzbach, a research scientist at Colorado State University\u2019s Department of Atmospheric Science specializing in Atlantic basin seasonal hurricane forecasts, talked to The Daily Beast about the likelihood that Dorian\u2019s wrath could reach the United States, and the devastation it could cause.\n\nWhat are the chances that Dorian will hit the United States at the 185 mph speed it is sustaining right now?\n\nAs it approaches the United States, it should encounter some stronger vertical wind shear which should begin to weaken the storm somewhat. It\u2019s still forecast to turn north just before it gets to Florida. It\u2019s going to be extremely close, but at this point, an actual landfall seems relatively low.\n\nIf it tracks close enough to the coast though, there could still be very substantial impacts including high winds and some storm surge. There could still be a landfall further up the coast in either Georgia or the Carolinas.\n\nWhat does a Category 5 storm entail?\n\nThat generally means pretty much complete destruction for everything in its path.\n\nIf Dorian does make landfall on the U.S., what kind of impact could it have on affected states?\n\nIt all depends on how close the storm gets. It is going to be tracking perpendicular to the coastline when it approaches, so small angle of approach changes could make huge differences in impacts.\n\nThe Slower Hurricane Dorian Moves, the More Dangerous It Is\n\nWhat makes Dorian different from other recent storms?\n\nDorian is an extremely powerful hurricane. It has maximum sustained winds of 185 mph. In the Atlantic basin, there\u2019s only been one hurricane with stronger winds: Hurricane Allen in 1980.\n\nHow does climate change, the warming ocean, affect hurricanes or specifically this one?\n\nIn the area where Dorian underwent its strongest intensification, water temperatures were near average. It\u2019s just that waters near the Bahamas are super hot on average. Currently they\u2019re 85-88\u00b0F.\n\nHurricanes live off of warm ocean hot water, and those kinds of temperatures are like jet fuel for hurricanes. Sea level rise is likely to exacerbate storm surge, since the background sea level will be higher. A warmer atmosphere means more rainfall, since a warmer atmosphere can hold more water vapor. Hurricanes may get a bit stronger (e.g., higher winds) in the future too, although there is a lot of uncertainty there.\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet our top stories in your inbox every day.
