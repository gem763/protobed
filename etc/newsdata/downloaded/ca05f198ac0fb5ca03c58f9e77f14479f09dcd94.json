While the value of the investment has not been disclosed, the base is expected to inject AU$27 million to the Fijian economy.\n\n\u201cThis engagement here, particularly with Fiji, but also with so many nations around the Pacific, and particularly that security engagement that we\u2019re having here, is all about keeping the whole region safe and stable, and secure,\u201d Morrison said in televised remarks on Saturday.", "description": "Australia and Fiji will send a joint United Nations peacekeeping mission to a disputed region in the Middle East as soon as next week, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said over the weekend.", "authors": ["Lidia Kelly", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191012&t=2&i=1439933757&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9B05J", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
