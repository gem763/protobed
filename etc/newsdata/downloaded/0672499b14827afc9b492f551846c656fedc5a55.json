Elizabeth Warren has seen a steady surge in the polls for the 2020 Democratic primary, and market analysts analysts are looking into how a Warren administration would affect the economy.\n\nWarren is \"rightfully considered a front-runner\" and is \"within striking distance\" of winning the nomination and White House, Raymond James strategists Ed Mills and Chris Meekins wrote in a Monday note. President Trump is still likely to win reelection \"by a hair,\" they added, but \"investors are not appropriately weighting the likelihood of a Warren presidency.\"\n\nThey may want to start paying attention, because a Warren victory \u2014 and an overall Democratic takeover of the Senate and White House \u2014 could hit the financial, health care, and energy sectors as progressive regulation hits bottom lines, the strategists said.\n\nRaymond James puts forth the following developments, which they think could weigh on stocks in those sectors:\n\nA fracking ban boosting oil and natural gas pricing.\n\nA push for green energy driving renewables.\n\nA wealth tax propping up fiscal stimulus.\n\nFederal health insurance advancements knocking private providers.\n\nRead more: 'Collecting information is not the same as connecting information': A CIO who oversees $6 billion explains how she discovers hidden opportunities, and shares her 3 best trades for the future\n\nAnalysts from RBC Capital Markets echoed the projection, noting that communication services and large internet firms could face new volatility if the Massachusetts congresswoman wins. Warren has previously called to break up big tech companies. Market fears could send shares of such firms lower after a Warren victory, though it's unclear if such an antitrust endeavor would be feasible.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg vowed to overcome break-up actions when asked specifically about Warren in leaked audio obtained by The Verge. He said a confrontation with the federal government would \"suck,\" but that if Warren were elected, Facebook would \"have a legal challenge\" to any antitrust actions.\n\n\"What would really 'suck' is if we don't fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy,\" Warren fired back on Twitter Tuesday.\n\nWall Street might fear a Warren presidency and the regulation she's called for, but the concerns are \"getting overblown,\" CNBC's Jim Cramer said Tuesday. The candidate isn't \"nearly as anti-business\" as portrayed, he added.\n\n\"I want to stop the fear of Sen. Warren. I really think that's a mistake,\" Cramer said.\n\nThe CNBC contributor said in September that financial industry CEOs were telling him \"she's got to be stopped\" in reference to Warren.\n\nThe Raymond James strategists also tapered their concerns over Warren-fueled regulation. The lofty promises for greater scrutiny are likely to stagnate should she take office, as policy disagreements and compromise water down potential legislation, they said.\n\n\"One of our tried and true mantras about Washington policy risk is that policies out of DC are never as bad as you fear or as good as you hope,\" Mills and Meekins wrote. \"DC generally finds a way to compromise or market forces prevent policymakers from voting in favor of the worst case scenario.\"\n\nNow read more markets coverage from Markets Insider and Business Insider:\n\nBlockchain startup Block.one settles with the SEC for $24 million over unregistered crypto offerings\n\nAirbnb reportedly opts for direct listing over traditional IPO ahead of 2020 market debut\n\nA wave of private-equity cash has poured into doctors' practices.
