He then told me to stop looking at him.\n\n\u2018He told me to stop complaining, to have a sense of humour. I wanted to know where the sound came from and it came from him, which you\u2019re not allowed to do.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s against the rules, it\u2019s hindrance, you shouldn\u2019t do it. But he said I should have a sense of humour about that but in that moment neither of us were in a joking, laughing kind of mood.\n\n\u2018He [umpire Fergus Murphy] wasn\u2019t saying anything to him. I was obviously frustrated with that. He wanted to engage with me, I probably shouldn\u2019t have done but I\u2019m not having him talk to me like that on the court.\u2019\n\nMurray still looked annoyed about the incident at his post-match press conference (Getty)\n\nAsked if he took anything away from the match, Murray added: \u2018No. I\u2019m very disappointed. There are a lot of things I need to get better at.\n\n\u2018I will go away and work on those things and be in a better position when I next play against him. I served for the match twice and not won, I think that\u2019s the first time that\u2019s happened in my career.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement", "description": "Andy Murray has slammed Fabio Fognini after the pair had a heated on-court row at the Shanghai Masters on Tuesday though admits he shouldn\u2019t have risen to the Italian\u2019s bait....", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1179811281_1570568628.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
