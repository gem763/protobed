It's that kind of weather we're going to see for the rest of today and on into Saturday evening.\"\n\nWinnipeg and southwestern Manitoba could see anywhere from 20 to 55 millimetres of rain on Saturday on top of all of the rain a day earlier.

It could be a risk to you,\" he said.\n\nIn addition, visibility could be reduced because of the rain.\n\n\"If the rain is to the point where you lose visibility, pull over, stop, and wait in a safe location until your visibility increases,\" Shaw said.\n\nHe said homeowners should make sure their sump pumps are working and their downspout is turned down.", "description": "Environment Canada's special weather statement issued for southwestern Manitoba forecasts even more\u00a0heavy rain Saturday, in what has been an unusual month of precipitation in the province.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5292717.1569075688!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/flooded-streets-winnipeg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
