Airlines, school districts and colleges nationwide are also allowing alternative gender markers.\n\n\u201cLanguage responds to social change. Things that need to be expressed get expressed,\u201d said Dennis Baron, professor emeritus of English and linguistics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\n\nIn recent years, a number of journalism style guides have allowed the gender-neutral pronouns. The Associated Press in 2017 announced it would permit journalists to use the singular \u201cthey\" in limited cases, and The Washington Post has formally recognized the new pronouns since 2015.\n\nNon-binary, pregnant and taking on the most gendered role of all: Motherhood\n\nBut in a blog post written before Tuesday\u2019s announcement, Merriam-Webster noted that \u201cthey\u201d has been used as a singular pronoun since the late 1300s, \u201cand that regardless of what detractors say, nearly everyone uses the singular they in casual conversation and often in formal writing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere have always been people who didn\u2019t conform to an expected gender expression, or who seemed to be neither male nor female. But we\u2019ve struggled to find the right language to describe these people\u2014and in particular, the right pronouns,\u201d the blog post stated. The singular \u201cthey,\u201d it said, is \u201cnot quite as newfangled as it seems: we have evidence in our files of the nonbinary they dating back to 1950, and it\u2019s likely that there are earlier uses of the nonbinary pronoun they out there.\u201d\n\nMany English speakers consider dictionaries to be \u201cconstitutional,\" authorities, Baron said. \u201cThey want to have some kind of stability in language that they can point to and say 'here\u2019s the rules.\u201d\n\nIn reality, Baron said, dictionaries are not intended to set rules on how people should behave. \u201cThey\u2019re a general indication of how language is being used at a particular time,\u201d Baron said. But the inclusion in Merriam-Webster of a singular \u201cthey\u201d for non-binary individuals is a significant recognition that the new pronouns have reached the mainstream.\n\nBaron, who is publishing a book next year called \u201cWhat\u2019s Your Pronoun?: Beyond He and She,\u201d said he knew the singular \u201cthey\u201d was \u201chere to stay\u201d as soon as people started arguing about its correct grammatical usage. For example, should the reflexive form be \u201cthemself\u201d or \u201cthemselves?\" The question is still under debate.\n\n\u201cIf people are already worried about how you express singular \u2018they\u2019 correctly, then it is already established,\u201d Baron said.\n\nIn recent months, a number of celebrities have come out as non-binary. Last week, Sam Smith declared on Twitter that the singer has decided to go by the non-binary pronouns they/them, adding that \u201cafter a lifetime of being at war with my gender I\u2019ve decided to embrace myself for who I am, inside and out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand there will be many mistakes and mis gendering but all I ask is you please please try,\u201d Smith tweeted. \u201cI hope you can see me like I see myself now.\u201d\n\nThe new definition of \u201cthey\u201d was among 530 new words added to the dictionary, Merriam-Webster said Tuesday. Among the other new words were \u201cdeep state,\u201d \u201cdad joke\u201d and \u201cfree solo.\u201d", "description": "\"They\" now has a fourth definition in the dictionary \u2014 \"used to refer to a single person whose gender identity is nonbinary.\"", "authors": ["Samantha Schmidt", "Reporter Covering Gender", "Family Issues"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DH6V6JGW7UI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
