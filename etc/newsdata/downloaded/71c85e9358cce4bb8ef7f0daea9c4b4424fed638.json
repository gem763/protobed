Instead of having a keyboard on its lower half like the flashback flip phones, the entire front of the concept device is a touch screen.\n\nSamsung said in a tweet that it is a new \"form factor\" and the brand is exploring other categories of foldable devices.\n\nHalloween 2019: Why not rent a car to match your costume?\n\nNational Cat Day: How to build up your pet's followers on Instagram\n\nThe concept has punch-hole cameras like the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus. No name for the conceptualized smartphon was announced and it's unclear if it will ever hit the market.\n\nAttendees of #SDC19 got a sneak peek at a brand new form factor Samsung is exploring for the foldable category of devices. #SamsungEventpic.twitter.com/rGtpvNj0SJ \u2014 Samsung US Newsroom (@SamsungNewsUS) October 29, 2019\n\nStill, the announcement gives credence to a September report that the electronics company is building a premium smartphone that folds down into a square, shutting closed like a clamshell.\n\nClamshell smartphone: Samsung's next phones could collapse into a square\n\nScreenshot of Samsung's new concept phone.

The hybrid between a smartphone and a tablet has a $1,980 price tag and two internal batteries.\n\nAs interest and intrigue continue to grow over foldable phones, it's still unclear how successful the segment will be considering smartphone companies have had a hard time getting first attempts right.\n\nSamsung's Galaxy fold was riddled with problems like creasing screens, delaying its official launch.\n\nHuawei was supposed to unveil its Mate X foldable phone in September after an originally planned release date in June. And reviewers of the Royole FlexPai complained the world's first commercial foldable smartphone had design and software issues.\n\nMotorola has teased a Razr comeback in 2019. CNET reported in September that the company is still on track.\n\nFollow Dalvin Brown on Twitter: @Dalvin_Brown.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/10/30/samsung-shows-next-level-flip-phone-idea-shuts-like-clam-shell/4095134002/", "description": "Instead of having a keyboard on its lower half like the flashback flip phones, the entire front of Samsung's concept device is a touch screen.", "authors": ["Dalvin Brown", "Published A.M.
