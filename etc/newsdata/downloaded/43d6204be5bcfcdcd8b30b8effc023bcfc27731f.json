According to prosecutors, they had parked the car after sending a video claiming responsibility for the planned attack to Rachid Kassim, a French member of the Islamic State group.\n\nThe court on Monday gave a jail sentence of 30 years to Madani, who had posed as a male jihadi, and 25 years to Gilligmann, a married mother of three, Le Figaro reported. Two other women who acted in concert with Madani and Gilligmann were given 20 years in jail.\n\nKassim was sentenced in absentia to life in jail, according to Le Figaro. Lesser sentences were given to another three people for helping the plotters or failing to report a crime.\n\nParis has been rocked by Islamist violence in the past few years.", "description": "A French court on Monday handed down sentences of at least 25 years in jail for two women with ties to Islamist militants who made a failed attempt to set off a crude car bomb outside Paris's Notre-Dame cathedral three years ago, Le Figaro newspaper reported.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
