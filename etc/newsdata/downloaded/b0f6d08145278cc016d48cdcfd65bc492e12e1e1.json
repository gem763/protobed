So he got on his bike, raced down the streets, just like they do in the movies, and confessed the undying feelings he has for his ex-girlfriend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnly, he chose to do that all on her wedding day. To another man. As you do.\n\nThe Colombian biker, who is said to hail from the city of Medellin, was caught on camera bartering with his former partner.\n\nHe was seen pleading with the bride to leave her husband-to-be and run away with him instead.\n\nIn the gripping video, the couple can be seen arguing, then kissing for a few seconds before she inevitably pushes him away.\n\nTalk about wedding day drama.\n\nHe tried (Picture: CEN)\n\nFootage shows the biker, still wearing his helmet, open the doors of the antique car to chat to the bride, decked out in a white wedding gown.\n\nAt one point, the lothario can even be seen getting down on his knees to physically beg her to be with him.\n\nAnd, for a moment, it seems the pleading worked as the bride kisses the man back.\n\nBut the romantic gesture didn\u2019t last very long as she then pushes him away. They have one final confrontation (with some distance between them) where the bride looks somewhat bored by his pleas.\n\nDespite the build-up, unfortunately, we don\u2019t know whether she took him back or went on her merry way to marry her fiance.\n\nBut passersby had thoughts. Some onlookers chanted \u2018don\u2019t get married\u2019 while others said \u2018kiss, kiss\u2019.\n\nSocial media users were a bit less forgiving. One person wrote: \u2018Everybody is responsible for their choices in life, the woman decided to get married, and this guy is humiliating a woman who does not love him anymore.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother said: \u2018He lost his opportunity when he was with her, now let her marry in peace, sh*t.\u2019\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nMORE: Couple get married in a hospital room after the groom is rushed into brain surgery on their wedding day\n\nMORE: Groom\u2019s brother gets into a wedding dress to prank him during the first look photos\n\nMORE: Bride shames sister-in-law for wearing a white lace dress to her wedding\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "The Colombian biker, who is said to hail from the city of Medellin, in the north-west, was caught on camera begging his ex to take him back.", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_89104531_1570625673.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
