But reporters were removed from the event before the audience was allowed to ask questions. The GOP leader also skipped taking questions reporters this week when speaking at a Federalist Society meeting in Kentucky, as well as a separate event with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar touting a grant for the University of Kentucky. Asked about McConnell\u2019s thinking and why he\u2019s decided not to weigh in directly on Trump\u2019s calls for Ukraine and China to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a spokesman declined to comment beyond what McConnell has said on the record.\n\nIt was reportedly McConnell who urged the White House to release the transcripts of Donald Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. According to reports, McConnell said the release would \u201cbolster the claim that the conversation was not improper because the speculation about what happened was becoming politically untenable,\u201d the Washington Post reported.\n\nThe transcript of the call does not show any such \u201cpressure\u201d or quid pro quo, as Democrats suggest.\n\nThe president said McConnell described the conversation as \u201cthe most innocent phone call,\u201d and the lawmaker told Politico in September that it is \u201claughable to think this is anywhere close to an impeachable offense.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve read the summary of the call. If this is the \u2018launching point\u2019 for House Democrats\u2019 impeachment process, they\u2019ve already overplayed their hand,\u201d McConnell told the outlet. \u201cIt\u2019s clear there is no quid pro quo that the Democrats were desperately praying for.\u201d\n\nMcConnell released an ad this month, slamming Democrats for their impeachment efforts and vowing to stop it as majority leader.\n\n\u201cNancy Pelosi is in the clutches of a leftwing mob,\u201d McConnell said in the ad. \u201cThey finally convinced her to impeach the president.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of you know your Constitution,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe way that impeachment stops is with a Senate majority with me as majority leader.\u201d\n\nWhile it remains clear that McConnell disagrees with the impeachment inquiry, his refusal to elaborate on his position has piqued interest. However, GOP strategists do not view his silence as a reason for alarm.\n\n\u201cMitch McConnell has learned there is no point in weighing in on every story,\u201d GOP strategist Ford O\u2019Connell said, according to The Hill.\n\nAnother GOP strategist, Matt Mackowiak, told The Hill that McConnell does not want to add difficultly for GOP incumbents in at-risk districts.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t like to ever get ahead of the conference, and he always wants to be in a place that\u2019s helpful to both ends,\u201d Mackowiak said.\n\n\u201cAnd look he\u2019s obviously very much attuned to the risk that some of those incumbents face and he doesn\u2019t want to make their job harder,\u201d he continued. \u201cOn the other hand, he also knows the facts are developing.\u201d", "description": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has gone silent on the Democrat-led House impeachment inquiry in recent days.", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/wi/ap/07/6a6bd9_mass-shootings-congress-63330-mitch-mcconnell-in-23-2019-file-photo-senate-e1570895460161-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
