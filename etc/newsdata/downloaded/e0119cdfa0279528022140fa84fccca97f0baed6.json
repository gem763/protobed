General Assembly to \u201ccall out\u201d China over its treatment of ethnic Uighurs.\n\nU.N. experts and activists say at least 1 million Uighurs, and members of other largely Muslim minority groups, have been detained in camps in the remote Xinjiang region.\n\nBeijing denies any mistreatment at the camps it says provide vocational training to help stamp out religious extremism and teach new work skills.\n\nPompeo was not the first U.S. official to make irresponsible remarks about Xinjiang, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a news conference in Beijing.\n\n\u201cWe are strongly dissatisfied with and resolutely opposed to this U.S. officials\u2019 neglecting of the facts, making irresponsible comments about China\u2019s Xinjiang policy and seriously interfering in China\u2019s internal affairs,\u201d Hua said.\n\nShe added \u201cin essence there is no difference\u201d between what China is doing in Xinjiang and what many other countries have done in the name of fighting extremism and terrorism.\n\n\u201cThe lies of U.S. politicians can\u2019t deceive anyone,\u201d she said.\n\nAsked last week at Kansas State University how Washington had been promoting an end to the oppression of Uighurs, Pompeo said it was insufficient and the U.S. would take up their cause at the U.N. General Assembly this month.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll do a number of gatherings, where our efforts will be to get other countries to sign up to help us call out this activity,\u201d Pompeo said.\n\n\u201cWe want freedom for those folks. We have lots of challenges with China, but this is about their fundamental unalienable rights for those particular individuals,\u201d Pompeo said.\n\nThough the United States has ramped up criticism of China\u2019s measures in Xinjiang, it has not imposed sanctions while it engages in on-again-off-again talks to resolve a bitter and costly trade war with Beijing.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s administration has considered sanctions against Chinese officials, including Xinjiang\u2019s Communist Party chief Chen Quanguo, a member of the Chinese leadership\u2019s powerful Politburo, since last year, but has held off amid Beijing\u2019s threats of retaliation.\n\nSome members of the U.S. Congress and other critics have been dismayed by Trump\u2019s apparent tendency to place efforts to resolve the trade dispute above human rights concerns.", "description": "China said on Monday U.S. \"lies\" about the western region of Xinjiang will not deceive anyone, after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said his country would use the U.N.
