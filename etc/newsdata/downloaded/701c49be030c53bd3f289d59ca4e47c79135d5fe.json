The items subject to the Sept. 1 tariff are those that are less commonly imported from China.", "description": "Items subject to the earlier round of tariffs are those not as commonly imported from China.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/i3l0T8Udru0vcK8KpAdrvnuvZjs=/0x180:3950x2402/1920x1080/2019/08/13/1565730133309.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-13"}
