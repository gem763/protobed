Markets started the day near session lows following Wall Street\u2019s stumble after poor U.S. manufacturing data raised recession fears.\n\nThe private Caixin China services purchasing managers index rose to 52.1 in August from 51.6 in July, according to the Wall Street Journal. Data suggested that domestic demand was stronger than foreign demand and an employment measurement jumped.\n\nOn Tuesday, U.S. stocks slipped after a key gauge of the manufacturing sector signaled the first contraction of activity in three years.\n\nOn the trade-war front, tariff hikes by both the U.S. and China went into effect over the weekend, and President Donald Trump on Tuesday urged China to make a deal soon, since he said terms will be even tougher if he is reelected in 2020. CNBC reported Tuesday that Trump was so angered last month when he learned that China would raise tariffs on U.S. products in retaliation for fresh U.S. tariff hikes that he wanted to double tariffs on Chinese goods. He was reportedly talked out of it after top advisers warned of the effect that could have on the economy and the stock market.\n\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei NIK, +0.03% was last about flat, and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index HSI, +1.31% jumped 1.4%.

Australia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 XJO, -0.59% fell 0.5%.\n\nAmong individual stocks, Nissan 7201, -1.55% and Mitsubishi Motors 7211, -2.23% sank in Tokyo trading after industry data found auto sales in South Korea fell sharply amid a consumer boycott against Japanese goods.
