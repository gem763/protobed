We have no idea if there will be one. So we\u2019re not going to comment on something that doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nHook announced a ratcheting up of the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign against Iran, offering a $15m reward for anyone offering information that led to the disruption of oil smuggling the US says is being carried out by Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).\n\nThe state department also imposed sanctions on 16 entities and 10 individuals it accused of being part of an IRGC network smuggling oil to the Assad regime in Syria and Hezbullah in Lebanon, \u201cand other terrorist actors\u201d.\n\nAs he was making the announcement, the Financial Times reported that Hook had personally emailed the captain of a tanker carrying Iranian oil, and offered him millions of dollars if he would steer the ship, the Grace 1, to a country where it could be impounded.\n\nIran to free seven crew members of seized British-flagged tanker Read more\n\nAccording to the account, which was confirmed by the state department, the first email was sent 11 days after the ship (now renamed the Adrian Darya 1) was released by Gibraltar, where it was temporarily held on suspicion of shipping oil to Syria.\n\n\u201cWith this money you can have any life you wish and be well-off in old age,\u201d Hook, the head of the state department\u2019s Iran Action Group, emailed the ship\u2019s captain, . It warned him: \u201cIf you choose not to take this easy path, life will be much harder for you.\u201d\n\nAfter the captain did not respond, he was placed under US treasury sanctions. Hook emailed or texted \u201croughly a dozen\u201d captains in recent months to cajole or scare them out of helping Iran evade oil sanctions.\n\n\u201cWe have seen the Financial Times article and can confirm that the details are accurate,\u201d the state department said in a statement. \u201cWe have conducted extensive outreach to several ship captains as well as shipping companies warning them of the consequences of providing support to a foreign terrorist organization.\u201d\n\nThe story was retweeted by Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif.\n\n\u201cHaving failed at piracy, the US resorts to outright blackmail \u2013 deliver us Iran\u2019s oil and receive several million dollars or be sanctioned yourself,\u201d Zarif said. He had previously claimed he was threatened with sanctions if he did not go to the White House to meet Trump.\n\nJavad Zarif (@JZarif) Having failed at piracy, the US resorts to outright blackmail\u2014deliver us Iran\u2019s oil and receive several million dollars or be sanctioned yourself.\n\n\n\nSounds very similar to the Oval Office invitation I received a few weeks back.\n\n\n\nIt is becoming a pattern.#BTeamGangsters pic.twitter.com/B1oQTLghWZ\n\n\u201cSounds very similar to the Oval Office invitation I received a few weeks back. It is becoming a pattern,\u201d Zarif added.\n\nHook made clear that the US was focused on closing any remaining loopholes in the oil embargo on Iran, not opening new ones.\n\n\u201cThere will be more sanctions coming. We can\u2019t make it any more clear that we are committed to this campaign of maximum pressure and we are not looking to grant any exceptions or waivers,\u201d Hook said.\n\nLess than four hours after Hook\u2019s announcement, Rouhani confirmed that Iran would taking another step away from the 2015 deal, in which it had accepted strict curbs on its nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief. Trump took the US out of the deal in May 2018 and the US has stepped up sanctions in phases since then.\n\nIn response, Iran has stopped complying with different elements in the deal, in phases. It has increased its stockpile of low enriched uranium, and boosted the level at which it enriches uranium. On Wednesday, Rouhani announced a third phase, in which Iran would ignore restrictions on its research and development on new models of centrifuges used in the enrichment process.\n\n\u201cWe will take all necessary steps to protect the Iranian nation\u2019s rights and interests ... Our third step involves the development of centrifuges. We will take this step on Friday,\u201d Rouhani said in a televised speech.", "description": "Hassan Rouhani confirmed Iran would be taking step away from 2015 deal after US envoy questioned existence of French proposal", "authors": ["Julian Borger"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68b3d9a6aa363c7aca5b147cf0bf36bbe1ed50ee/0_0_5167_3100/master/5167.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=50464f67d045e285f06b1779575d1628"}
