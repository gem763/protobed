But the Manchester United star was cleared to continue after treatment.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nWales recovered to get a foothold in the game as Moore caused Croatia problems.\n\nHe won a free-kick which Bale failed to get over the wall.\n\nBut Bale did superbly to level in first half stoppage time with a fine left-foot finish across goal after a super first touch.\n\nWales' record scorer was played in by Spurs defender Ben Davies who did well to dispossess Mateo Kovacic.\n\nBut the visitors moaned Chelsea ace Kovacic was fouled in the process and the hobbling midfielder was subbed at the break.\n\nAfter the re-start Wales pushed for a winner as James tested Livakovic with a left-foot shot.\n\nWhile dangerman Bale beat three players, including Modric, on a thrilling run into the box.\n\nAllen was booked in the closing stages which rules him out of the trip to Baku next month.\n\nBut despite failing to find a winner, Wales know if they end the group level with Slovakia on 13 points, they will finish above them because of their superior head-to-head record.", "description": "WALES 1-1 CROATIA: Real Madrid superstar Bale struck to keep Wales in the fight for a spot at next summer's finals", "authors": ["James Nursey", "Image", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20573812.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Euro-2020-Qualifier-Group-E-Wales-v-Croatia.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
