The blamegame has truly begun.\n\nBoris's blueprint is radically different from anything Theresa May even considered, and arises from a combination of principle and political necessity.\n\nJohnson has long argued that Mrs May's deal would have made trade deals impossible. He wants us to be free to go our own way after Brexit.\n\nThe logical consequence of that position is there must be a customs border between Northern Ireland and the south.\n\nBut there will be no border checks \u2013 which would inflame nationalist sentiment.\n\nThe Prime Minister (pictured with Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid) was typically bullish about Brexit and rattled through plans that he promised would build a 'positive new partnership' with the EU\n\nFor example, an Australian tractor would face checks as it crossed from Liverpool to Belfast to make sure it met product standards.\n\nIf it was then moved across the border to Dublin, it would be tracked and would face customs checks where it left and where it arrived.\n\nBut what about regulatory checks, which Brussels insists are needed on goods entering the EU?\n\nOn this, Mr Johnson \u2013 and his allies in the DUP \u2013 have offered a significant compromise which would see Northern Ireland follow EU rules.\n\nHe has taken the two border challenges \u2013 customs and regulations \u2013 and split them between the two sides.\n\nCall it a fudge if you like, it is a workable attempt to solve an intractable problem.\n\nBoris's blueprint is radically different from anything Theresa May even considered, and arises from a combination of principle and political necessity (pictured with girlfriend Carrie Symonds)\n\nTo sweeten the bitter pill of having laws for Northern Ireland set by Brussels, the Northern Ireland Assembly and executive must sign off the plan now and every four years.\n\nWith some considerable force in his letter Mr Johnson said these votes were 'fundamental to democracy'.\n\nAs soon as the proposals were published, all eyes were on Arlene Foster of the DUP.\n\nWould her party declare 'no surrender' and kill it off? No. Standing shoulder to shoulder with Mr Johnson at a raucous Tory conference rally on Tuesday night, it was clear they were fully inside the tent.\n\nIn theory, these developments could unlock a narrow majority in Parliament.\n\nMany of the 21 Tory MPs who were stripped of the whip will still vote for a deal. With the DUP onside, that's ten more.\n\nAnd if the DUP don't object, most of the European Research Group will back the deal, as could more than a dozen Labour MPs.\n\nSo what is Brussels' next move?\n\nIf Brussels were to dismiss the deal or place impossible obstacles in its path it would be a sign they are listening to Remainers such as Tony Blair and Dominic Grieve, who say there should be a second referendum with an option to stay.\n\nFor some \u2013 though not all \u2013 EU leaders, this would be a preferred outcome.\n\nOn the other hand, perhaps Emmanuel Macron will seize a chance to kick Britain out as quickly as possible? Will Angela Merkel be as uncompromising as when she stifled David Cameron's renegotiation? Will Varadkar realise he is in a hole, facing a No Deal disaster?\n\nSurprisingly, it is Cognacswilling commission president Jean-Claude Juncker in whom senior ministers are investing hope. Shortly to retire, doing a Brexit deal would be a lasting legacy.\n\nTurning the deal down would surely be a tactical error.\n\nThere is a slim possibility of Remainer MPs getting their acts together enough to force a second referendum, and it would string things out for months if not years.\n\nMuch more likely is that the courts force the UK to follow the terms of the so-called 'Surrender Act' \u2013 which prevents a No Deal Brexit \u2013 and delay our leaving the EU, prompting a general election.\n\nIf the polls are right, Mr Johnson could triumph, and with a Commons majority he would be in a much stronger position.\n\nThe threat was clear in Mr Johnson's conference speech: 'Let us be in no doubt that the alternative is No Deal.'\n\nLast night, No 10 officials said that if the answer is a flat 'No', Mr Johnson won't even attend the summit in two weeks' time when the deal would be signed off. So EU leaders have a choice.\n\nThey can engage, be pragmatic and try to find a solution.\n\nOr they can turn over the negotiating table and walk away before Boris Johnson has even sat down.", "description": "JACK DOYLE: With his bombastic battle-cry of 'Get Brexit Done', Boris Johnson left the conference stage to ecstatic applause.
