It\u2019s the antithesis of courage in the pursuit of journalism. It undermines relationships we\u2019ve nurtured. It\u2019s an attack on our flexible workplace, where we have freely permitted the adjustment of employee schedules to meet their needs \u2013 for a child at school or a spouse who is home sick, a parent who requires help or a medical appointment.\n\nWe have been told that one union supporter threatened that things will get \u201ceven messier\u201d in the weeks to come. If organized surveillance and spying are already occurring in the face of a divisive unionization effort, I hope you carefully consider the consequences of bringing the Guild into our workplace.\n\nLet me tell you about surveillance at my home because I refused to kill a story about police shootings in California. A former detective who had shot two people \u2013 including an innocent bystander \u2013 got into my house, turned on a video camera and made a recording of my dining room, my front door, my living room and my son, then 17, who didn\u2019t know enough to turn him away.\n\nI reference this incident to underscore the fact that journalists are targets of political haymakers and troublemakers, of operatives and would-be intimidators, of crackpots and criminals. We are targets on social media. We are targets when we stand firm on a story that unmasks a murderer running for office, a teacher who molests children, an appointee who bulldozes indigenous artifacts or stockpiles weapons, a mobster who doesn\u2019t much like being called a scam artist or a dirty trickster intent on DOXing a critic.\n\nThese are the types who surveil journalists.\n\nJournalists don\u2019t surveil other journalists.\n\nColleagues who have produced award-winning work together as a team do not surveil one another.\n\nStanding together to fight on behalf of the public is a surmountable task for the very reason that our newsroom is a sanctified space. It\u2019s a place where we defend one another, where a supervisor can flex a reporter\u2019s schedule \u2013 because they know and trust each other.\n\nLet me make this clear: surveillance activities or any type of harassment or intimidation of employees in this newsroom will not be tolerated to any degree. Any such conduct will be addressed through disciplinary channels. I expect every employee to conduct herself or himself and treat co-workers and managers with respect and professionalism.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns or want to discuss this, please reach out to me and/or Amber Anderson in HR.\n\nGB\n\nGreg Burton\n\nExecutive Editor/West Regional Editor", "description": "Greg Burton accused union sympathizers of \"surveilling\" other journalists, saying that's something he'd expect of a murderer or child molester.", "authors": ["Labor Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6966972500003200751fe9.jpeg?ops=1778_1000"}
