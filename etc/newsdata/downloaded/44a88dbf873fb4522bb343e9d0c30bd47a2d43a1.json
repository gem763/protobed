I didn\u2019t really watch any movies this week, so I\u2019m going to use this time to talk about big-budget adaptations of books \u2014 specifically, books I like.\n\nIn the post-Harry Potter boom, it felt like every popular book series on the planet was being rushed to film. Some of these (Hunger Games, Twilight, The Da Vinci Code books) did well. Many (The Golden Compass, Ender\u2019s Game, Percy Jackson, The Dark Tower, The Giver, The Mortal Instruments, Eragon, The Spiderwick Chronicles, Legend of the Seeker, The Dark Is Rising, A Series of Unfortunate Events, etc.) did not.\n\nBut in a post-Game of Thrones world, we\u2019re seeing a new wave of studios looking to mine the annals of literature for the next big hit. Netflix announced the cast for Shadow and Bone, based on Leigh Bardugo\u2019s books, this week. Amazon\u2019s Wheel of Time show had its first table read. HBO\u2019s adaptation of His Dark Materials (the second attempt after the failed film) got a great new trailer. Maybe these will all crash and burn, too. But I\u2019m hopeful that these more thoughtful-looking approaches will succeed because I like all of these books.\n\nCheck out 12 trailers from this week below.\n\nBirds of Prey\n\nComing out of the awfulness that was 2016\u2019s Suicide Squad, Birds of Prey sees Margot Robbie\u2019s Harley Quinn declaring emancipation from her former paramour (Jared Leto\u2019s... unique take on the Joker) and teaming up with a crew of female antiheroes of her own. It\u2019ll come out on February 7th, 2020.\n\nThe King\u2019s Man\n\nThe first trailer for the Kingsman prequel left me a little unenthused for this, but the latest preview has me much more on board. It\u2019s got far more of the spy-genre whimsy that made the originals so much fun. It\u2019ll come out on February 14th, 2020.\n\n1917\n\nThis looks like Dunkirk by way of Sam Mendes (his first film since 2015\u2019s James Bond thriller Spectre). Honestly, I can probably work with it. If nothing else, the film certainly looks great. It\u2019ll be out on December 25th.\n\nThe Gentlemen\n\nAfter his last few films went into weird places, including King Arthur retellings and Disney remakes, Guy Ritchie returns to what he does best: gritty, extremely English crime.\n\nSwipe Night\n\nEveryone\u2019s making their own original shows now, and that includes... Tinder? Swipe Night is a weekly interactive show about the apocalypse that will premiere in Tinder\u2019s app. And somehow, it will also lead you to more dates? It\u2019ll start airing on October 6th.\n\nLupin the Third: The First\n\nI\u2019ll be honest, I don\u2019t know anything about this anime / manga series, which is apparently about a gentleman thief called Lupin. I do know that this trailer looks rad. It\u2019ll release on December 6th in Japan. No US release date has been announced yet.\n\nI Lost My Body\n\nThis animated film has a very weird premise: a severed hand travels Paris to reunite with its owner. It\u2019s apparently very good, though. It\u2019ll be in \u201cselect theaters\u201d on November 15th and on Netflix on November 29th.\n\n6 Underground\n\nRyan Reynolds leads a team of six vigilante billionaires who blow stuff up and fight crime in what looks like Michael Bay\u2019s impression of the Fast and the Furious franchise. It\u2019ll hit Netflix on December 13th.\n\nReprisal\n\nHulu calls this a \u201chyper-noir\u201d about a woman who seeks revenge against her brother and his gang after they try to kill her. The trailer has strong Kill Bill vibes, which seems promising. It\u2019ll be out on December 6th.\n\nRichard Jewell\n\nClint Eastwood directed this dramatic take on the story of Richard Jewell, a security guard who discovered a bomb during the 1996 Centennial Olympic Park bombing but was then accused as a suspect. It\u2019ll be out on December 13th.\n\nEli\n\nEli has an autoimmune disorder that requires him to live closed off from the world. His parents find a not-at-all creepy doctor in a not-at-all creepy hospital who claims to be able to help. (It\u2019s haunted. It\u2019s very haunted.) It\u2019ll hit Netflix on October 18th.\n\nHis Dark Materials\n\nHBO has been pumping out a ton of trailers for His Dark Materials (got to find something to replace Game of Thrones!), but this one might be the best yet. Look at that armored bear! Just look at him! It\u2019ll hit HBO on November 3rd.", "description": "Check out 12 new trailers from this week, including a first look at Birds of Prey, along with 1917, The King\u2019s Man, His Dark Materials, and more.", "authors": ["Chaim Gartenberg", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gRqBkqQ0CXqUbtaF0ixegOpTuU4=/0x25:1280x695/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19260040/maxresdefault.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
