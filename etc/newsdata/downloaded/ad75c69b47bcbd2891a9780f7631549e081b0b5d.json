That was the month business at his modular building company stopped dead. \u201cIt fell off the face of the earth overnight,\u201d said the co-founder and chief executive of Alta-Fab Structures Ltd. in Nisku, Alta., a hamlet south of Edmonton. \u201cWe had a full production lineup to Christmas and an 18-month backlog. Then it was literally nothing.\u201d\n\nBefore then, Alta-Fab was at the top of its game in supplying modular housing for oilpatch workers, with five plants throughout North America and 850 employees. After oil prices and the provincial economy collapsed, the company was down to 22 employees and one site.\n\nMany others in the same industrial park that were counting on the oil boom closed their doors, but Van Weelden was fortunate enough to have some reserves to start rebuilding.\n\nAlta-Fab began sourcing small projects and building up a rental fleet, hoping that side of its business would grow. Then a chance encounter at a bike race event with Ryan Pomeroy, who had just purchased Kananaskis Mountain Lodge, sparked some new ideas.\n\nPomeroy was intent on building a state-of-the-art Nordic spa in the Rockies just west of Calgary; Van Weelden was an avid spa enthusiast.\n\n\u201cI gave him some ideas, and he said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you do it and I will be your partner,\u2019\u201d Van Weelden recalled. \u201cI realized I had found a great opportunity to use the skill sets and facilities we had.\u201d\n\nSince then, Alta-Fab has explored other ways to apply its expertise, including additional spa projects and converting its units for use at special events, such as trailers at festivals.\n\nThe climate for small and mid-sized businesses in Alberta continues to be challenging, said Sandip Lalli, chief executive of the Calgary Chamber of Commerce.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been difficult raising capital and to scale companies, as well as meet new customers \u2014 all key touch points for small businesses especially,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Lalli said there are other success stories out there.\n\n\u201cWe forget that there are also good stories of businesses that have adjusted their business models,\u201d she said. \u201cMany have been looking at the full landscape and determining where they can add value rather than chasing a specific industry.\u201d\n\nOne of them is About Staffing in Calgary. Things had been going swimmingly for the recruiter Sharlene Massie founded in 1996. So much so, she added a light industrial division in 2012, just before the massive flooding that occurred in June 2013 and then the recession.\n\n\u201cAfter that, the problems were non-stop,\u201d she said. \u201cBusiness dropped by more than half almost overnight because 65 per cent of our business was oil and gas related.\u201d\n\nMassie had to cut the number of her employees to five from 25, but has since been able to increase it to 10.\n\n\u201cThank goodness we had started the light industrial group. It now accounts for one-third of our business and oil and gas is only about 10 per cent,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are fighting for every penny and every placement and watching every line item. We have had to roll back wages and benefits. But we still have some energy left. The fight isn\u2019t over yet.\u201d\n\nFor immigration lawyer Evelyn Ackah, founder and managing lawyer of Ackah Business Immigration Law, the reckoning started in 2016.\n\n\u201cWe went from our best year to our worst year in 2017,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were down almost 40 per cent.\u201d\n\nRebuilding her company meant working to increasing her presence beyond Calgary. Ackah started by setting up two virtual offices in Toronto and Vancouver, then investing in a marketing consultant to build her online presence.\n\n\u201cI knew I couldn\u2019t just rely on good work and referrals,\u201d she said. \u201cWe put a lot of focus on how to distinguish ourselves and building relationships we never had before.\u201d\n\nOne advantage was Ackah\u2019s expertise in U.S. immigration law, a skill that ultimately increased her business.\n\n\u201cA lot of engineers lost their jobs and found work in the U.S. There weren\u2019t many lawyers that did U.S. immigration so that really helped us,\u201d she said. \u201cIt looks like 2019 will be our best year ever.\u201d\n\nOne positive change that has come out of such entrepreneurial struggles has been a noticeable push toward collaboration, said Jeff Chase, the City of Edmonton\u2019s director of local and emerging economy.\n\n\u201cEveryone is doing a lot to support each other,\u201d he said.\n\nChase points to examples such as The Public, a new hub where small entrepreneurs in the food industry can rent commercial kitchen space.\n\nVan Weelden has also witnessed a shift in how small businesses are working together to navigate the downturn.\n\n\u201cOur competitors are now collective partners,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re happy to share leads.\u201d\n\nAs a veteran who has gone through multiple recessions, Van Weelden is happy to share his experience with others.\n\n\u201cWhile many newer companies may have folded, those of us who have been in business longer know you have to plan psychologically and financially and be open-minded,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really about looking at your core competency, breaking it down, and finding new applications for what you\u2019re good at.\u201d\n\nFinancial Post", "description": "The climate for small and mid-sized businesses in Alberta continues to be challenging, but there are success stories out there", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/van-weelden.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
