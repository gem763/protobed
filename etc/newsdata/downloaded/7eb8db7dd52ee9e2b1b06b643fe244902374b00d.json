We await further research into this potentially exciting development.\"\n\nFollow James on Twitter.", "description": "Researchers have been testing the technique in the lab and hope to move into human clinical trials.", "authors": ["James Gallagher", "Health", "Science Correspondent", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/FDF9/production/_108671056_20180214_jsa_liver_110.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
