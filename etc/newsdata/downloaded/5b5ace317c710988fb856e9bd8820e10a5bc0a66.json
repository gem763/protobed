For thousands of families in North Carolina, West Virginia, and Virginia who want their stolen livelihoods back the likely answer is that it\u2019s going to take an act of Congress.\n\nDue to an irrational and extremist campaign by radical environmentalists, construction of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline has been shut down for nearly a year. They may be proud of their tactical success, but that only demonstrates how disconnected they are from reality \u2013 their actions have cost 4,500 workers their jobs and the pipeline developers $1 billion.\n\nThe case is heading to the Supreme Court. The issue is whether a circuit court was correct in blocking the project based on the argument by environmentalists that the pipeline owner did not have the proper permits to pass under the Appalachian Trail. The circuit court put it to Congress to clarify which agency is proper permitting agency.\n\nNever mind that more than 50 Appalachian Trail crossings already exist or that the law cited to shut down the project was described by environmentalists themselves as \u201ca very discreet issue on a not commonly known law.\u201d\n\nAnd never mind that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has already taken three years to review and approve the project.\n\nThe shutdown is another example of the project-by-project \u2013 at times, foot-by-foot, stream-by-stream \u2013 guerilla warfare being waged against energy infrastructure by extreme elements of the environmental community. They have become adept at distorting the regulatory process and abusing the court system to act in their political interests at the expense of taxpayers, business, and most importantly our members\u2019 jobs.\n\nWe can\u2019t overstate the damage threatened by those waging this war. The 600-mile Atlantic Coast Pipeline will serve communities in need of good, middle-class careers. It will provide cleaner energy that can attract large employers in regions that desperately need economic development. And strengthening the region\u2019s natural gas energy infrastructure will do more to address climate change than all the petty lawsuits and attempts to gum up the regulatory process by environmentalists, who seem ignorant of the fact that an array of experts believe natural gas is the planet\u2019s best bridge between high-carbon energy sources and a no-carbon future.\n\nThose waging this anti-energy war arrogantly belittle the casualties, seeming to believe they are the only ones who can carry the mantle of concern for climate change. The men, women and families directly affected by the Atlantic Coast Pipeline care as much about clean water and air, safety, and climate change as do the activists. They live and raise families where they build projects. They, too, cherish the natural wonder of places such as the Appalachian Trail. As union construction laborers, they are the most skilled, highly-trained and conscientious builders of energy infrastructure in the world.\n\nThe Supreme Court may well rectify the situation, but that will mean continued delays until at least next spring. It will mean another jobless holiday season, lost opportunity throughout the region and more misplaced bravado and self-congratulation by extremists.\n\nIt must be understood that if Congress decides to act in providing this clarification, it will not approve nor streamline the pipeline. It will not override any federal laws, nor will it overturn the circuit court\u2019s previous decision. It simply provides clarity for an agency\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\nThis is a no-brainer for Congress. This encompasses the interests of both Republicans and Democrats. It clarifies regulatory jurisdiction and, if the project is approved, it will provide thousands of good union jobs. It shouldn\u2019t take an act of Congress to simply build a pipeline, but as long as it does, Congress must act.\n\nTerry O\u2019Sullivan is General President of the Laborers\u2019 International Union of North America, representing a half-million members who work predominantly in construction.", "description": "It shouldn\u2019t take an act of Congress to simply build a pipeline, but as long as it does, Congress must act.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/natualgaspipeline_052215getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
