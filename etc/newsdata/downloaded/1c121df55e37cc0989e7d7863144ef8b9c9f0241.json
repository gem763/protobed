He added that al-Baghdadi had \u201cdragged\u201d three young children with him as he reached the end of a tunnel in the compound he was in. They died, along with al-Baghdadi, when the terrorist leader detonated a suicide vest, Trump said. Two wives of al-Baghdadi also died, he noted. He said they were both wearing suicide vests that had not detonated.\n\nAl-Baghdadi\u2019s body was mutilated by the blast but an on-site DNA test confirmed his identity, Trump said.\n\nThe President said no American personnel were lost or injured in the operation with the exception of one dog. Eleven young children had been moved out of the compound and were uninjured.\n\nThe operation began two weeks ago and, once complete, the special forces landed safely in a \u201cfriendly port in a friendly country,\u201d Trump said, declining to provide more details.\n\nHe had tweeted Saturday night that \u201cSomething very big has just happened!\u201d and said during his announcement that he did so only after the military personnel were secure and had landed.\n\nSomething very big has just happened! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 27, 2019\n\nAl-Baghdadi has led ISIS for the last five years, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe President\u2019s announcement comes after many previous reports that al-Baghdadi had died.\n\nTrump said on Sunday that Al-Baghdadi spent \u201chis last moments in utter fear, in total panic and dread\u201d and \u201cterrified of the American forces bearing down on him.\u201d\n\nAs a result of the raid, Trump said, the special forces were also able to retrieve \u201chighly sensitive information\u201d about ISIS as it relates to their origins and future plans.\n\nTrump also referenced the murder of innocent Americans by ISIS, including journalists Steven Sotloff and James Foley.\n\nTrump also expressly thanked Russia, Turkey, Syria and Iraq for their cooperation and noted that the military had to fly low and crossed over territory with \u201ctremendous firepower.\u201d They flew over areas with Russian, Turkish and Syrian presence, he said. The U.S. had told Russia they were \u201ccoming in,\u201d Trump said, but did not reveal details about why \u2014 beyond indicating that \u201cit would be a mission they would like.\u201d\n\nTrump closed his official remarks by saying that al-Baghdadi \u201cwill never again harm another innocent man, woman or child.\u201d The President said: \u201cHe died like a dog. He died like a coward. The world is now a much safer place. God bless America.\u201d", "description": "No American personnel were lost or injured in the operation, Trump said", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/EW7X1DeIXb8NkrRVUplfcA--~B/aD02ODI7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/8cf67b287ab273b799e19f44cb82b140", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
