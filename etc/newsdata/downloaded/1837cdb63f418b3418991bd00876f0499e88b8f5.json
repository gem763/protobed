The cost to the airline was estimated to be about \u00a340m a day.\n\nPilots have demanded a profit-share scheme and rejected a three-year pay deal worth 11.9%, claiming they have been let down by the airline after supporting it through several lean years.\n\nThe travel plans of tens of thousands of passengers are likely to be affected, although the airline had warned customers of likely cancellations when the first wave of strike dates were announced on 23 August. It also removed flights from sale. BA would on a normal day carry an average of 145,000 passengers.\n\nIn a statement, British Airways said: \u201cIt is now a month since we shook hands on a pay deal. We urge [Balpa] to call off their strike and return to negotiations.\n\n\u201cTo give our customers as much certainty as possible, we are now contacting all those affected to offer them a full refund or a rebook on an alternative date, destination or airline. We are very sorry that Balpa\u2019s actions will affect thousands more travel plans.\u201d\n\nExtra staff have been drafted in to work on BA\u2019s phone lines after it drew criticism that it failed to respond to customer queries when the first cancellations were announced. The airline said its customer relations teams have now dealt with almost half a million telephone calls since the strike dates were set by Balpa.\n\nBalpa had said it would hold talks to avert further strikes but that it wanted \u201cmeaningful negotiations\u201d, adding that BA had to improve its offer.\n\nThe union accused the airline of being \u201cirresponsible and inconsiderate\u201d to customers by cancelling flights now rather than holding talks. BA would be liable for additional payouts to passengers, covering costs such as hotels, if it cancelled with less than 14 days\u2019 notice, under EU261 flight compensation rules.\n\nA Balpa spokeswoman said: \u201cBalpa set a gap between the first and second periods of strike action to give BA time to work with us to settle this dispute with their pilots. We had today been exchanging new ideas to do that via [the arbitration service] Acas and so it irresponsible and inconsiderate to its customers that BA has pulled out and decided to start cancelling flights now, just to save money on compensation. BA did not respond to our latest proposals before cancelling these flights.\n\n\u201cPassengers who will be affected by these cancellations should know that we have given BA multiple opportunities to work with us so we could call off this action.\u201d\n\nThe consumer group Which? said customers with bookings should beware of being \u201cfobbed off\u201d by British Airways. Adam French, a consumer rights expert at Which? said: \u201cBA must now proactively inform those affected by any fresh cancellations of their rights to be rerouted on the next available flight, even if this is with a rival airline.\n\n\u201cUnless a refund is vital to you, don\u2019t be fobbed off by this option. A refund means your travel plans would no longer be the responsibility of the airline and you would not be entitled to any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred because of the disruption.\u201d\n\nThe union has a mandate for further industrial action until January.", "description": "Thousands of passengers offered refunds or rebookings for trips around 27 September", "authors": ["Gwyn Topham"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b98924ba27da69734c7c91fcf6eda31571b9c84/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7349818d4848a5038c6ff47988c8d03b"}
