Hungary\u2019s Foreign Minister told RT that his country is very much for the bloc, but it should not turn into a Brussels-centered empire.\n\n\u201cWe represent a very strong anti-migration policy. We made it very clear that no illegal migrants will be allowed to enter the territory of Hungary,\u201d Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Peter Szijjarto said. On top of that, Hungary has repeatedly said that \"we don\u2019t take part in this [EU] quota system of redistribution and resettlement.\u201d\n\nThis position contradicts the policy of Brussels, he lamented,\"because Brussels would like the migrants to come to European Union.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com Breakup of EU \u2018can\u2019t be ruled out\u2019 if Brussels tries to enforce pro-immigration policies - Orban\n\nInstead of bringing refugees to Europe to supposedly \u201chelp\u201d them, Hungary has opted to help the people in need in their home countries. As the 2015 migrant crisis unfolded, Budapest launched a special program dubbed \u2018Hungary Helps\u2019 that focuses on providing relief to the Christians living in the Middle East. Budapest has already \u201cspent $40 million on helping 50 thousand Christians\u201d in the region, according to the minister.\n\nOur principal position is the following: we have to bring help where it is needed and should not bring problems where there are no problems.\n\nWhile such an approach is quite different to the pro-migration, globalist stance preached by Brussels, Budapest is not against the EU, but is actually all for it as the country \u201cis deeply integrated into the European economy,\u201d Szijjarto said. Hungary\u2019s view of the EU itself, however, differs from the mainstream \u2013 Budapest believes the Union should be based on the \u201cstrong member states,\u201d which embrace their \u201cChristian heritage.\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t want to see an empire being built in Brussels, we want to see a European Union based on strong member states, where national identity, national competence and national sovereignty are important.\n\nThe wave of migration has increased the terror threat in the Union, as well as created entire \u201cparallel societies\u201d within some of its western member states, Szijjarto said.\n\nOver the past few years, several terrorist attacks were committed throughout Europe by asylum seekers. Blaming the increased terrorist threat solely on migrants, however, would not be entirely correct, since domestic radicalization appears to be on the rise in the EU as well.\n\nAlso on rt.com At least 19 cars burned, barber shop rocked by EXPLOSION in Stockholm suburb\n\nThat said, Szijjarto bemoaned the emergence of the \u201cparallel societies,\u201d composed of a \u201cloud minority [that] puts daily pressure on the silent majority.\u201d\n\nCrime-infested \u201cno-go\u201d zones, where police and businesses are too afraid to venture, exist now in several European countries. Sweden appears to have had it the worst, as major cities in the country, including Stockholm, Malmo and Gothenburg, have such areas.\n\nto RT newsletter to get stories the mainstream media won\u2019t tell you.", "description": "Brussels and Budapest have been locked in a standoff about illegal migrants for a few years.
