An attack from one NATO member on another would therefore put the alliance in a paradoxical situation.\n\nNATO was originally founded at the start of the Cold War to counter the Soviet Union, and its purpose has evolved over time. But it continues to serve as a deterrent to Russian aggression in Europe, particularly after the annexation of Crimea in 2014. Hence, if NATO collapsed or if the alliance was put under major strains then it would be advantageous to the Kremlin and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nNATO did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Insider.\n\nFurther complicating any potential military action against Turkey by the US is the fact there are roughly 50 nuclear weapons \u2014 B61 gravity bombs \u2014 that are stored by the US at Incirlik Air Base in Turkey. In a break from protocol, Trump seemed to confirm the existence of these weapons last week.\n\nRead more: Trump's disastrous retreat from Syria raises new questions about his financial interests in Turkey\n\nThe White House abruptly announced the withdrawal of US forces from northeast Syria on October 6 after a phone call between Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nThe move prompted swift criticism in Washington, including rare backlash from congressional Republicans, given it effectively abandoned Kurdish forces who bore the brunt of the US-led campaign against ISIS to a Turkish military invasion. Trump was accused of betraying US allies over the move.\n\nThe Turkish military incursion has fostered a humanitarian crisis in Syria and there have been reports of war crimes committed against the Kurds. American forces in Syria also came under fire by Turkish artillery two days after the invasion, and some US officials believe this was deliberate.\n\nTurkey has also been accused of using chemical weapons in Syria against civilians. In response to a query on these allegations, a US official in the White House on Friday told Insider: \"We've seen these concerning reports and are seeking more information.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has sent a lot of conflicting messages on Syria\n\nVice President Mike Pence and Pompeo traveled to Turkey last week to broker a ceasefire agreement with Erdogan. The so-called ceasefire, a characterization Turkey promptly rejected, effectively involved the US negotiating the surrender of the Kurds.\n\nFollowing the announcement of the deal, which involved a cessation of hostilities for five days to allow the Kurds to withdraw from the area, there have been reports of ongoing violence in the region that suggest the ceasefire has not been upheld.", "description": "This comment came a little over two weeks after Trump's decision to withdraw US troops from northeast Syria, which paved the way for Turkey to invade.", "authors": ["John Haltiwanger"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/lhKjlNLfmk_tM5CDXG1kwg--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/e502c3cef0d50deed846e7d74a00c754", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
