I\u2019d like an easy recipe, because all the ones I\u2019ve tried are very complicated.\n\nPeter, Chippenham, Wiltshire\n\nAh, fish soup \u2026 along with onions on strings, La Marseillaise and gilets jaunes, there\u2019s little that\u2019s more evocative of la belle France. The thing is, though, many of those alluringly branded supermarch\u00e9 jars aren\u2019t true soupes de poissons at all, but mass-produced imposters. As Henry Harris, one of the UK\u2019s most respected purveyors of Gallic cuisine, explains: \u201cThe real deal should be a murky broth of immense flavour, not claggy and rusty-red.\u201d In other words, the dense texture of some jarred soups isn\u2019t a sign of superior contents; it\u2019s culinary subterfuge. \u201cThey\u2019re thickened with cornflour,\u201d Harris says, \u201cwhich makes a gloop you can stand a spoon up in.\u201d\n\nAs with all fish cookery, the principal raw ingredient is all-important. \u201cYou need spanking-fresh fish, or it\u2019s really not worth bothering with,\u201d argues Harris, who heads the kitchens of the Harcourt Inns group of restaurant-pubs in London, with French-leaning menus inspired by his 35-odd years at the stove.\n\nBut what fish exactly? Claude Bosi, chef/patron of two-Michelin-starred Bibendum in London, insists it has to be rockfish; being irreparably French, he adds that \u201cit must come from the Med\u201d. Sadly, we don\u2019t get much rascasse and sea perch on UK fish counters, so go for red gurnard and, if your pocket can stretch to it, red mullet, and bulk up the fishy quota with cheaper bream. Mind you, Harris says, gurnard alone works just fine: \u201cThe key is whole, cleaned fish, not fillets. The bones are what give the soup body and flavour.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not at all complicated to make, either, Bosi adds: \u201cYou don\u2019t need lots of ingredients, but it is time-consuming.\u201d His top tip? Don\u2019t cut corners or you won\u2019t get the depth you\u2019re after. Harris agrees: \u201cThe idea\u2019s the same as with stock \u2013 the aim is to extract as much flavour as possible.\u201d\n\nThe other ingredients are simply regular soup veg \u2013 for each 1kg fish, you need an onion, a carrot, two celery sticks, four garlic cloves, a fennel bulb for that trademark aniseedy back note, all chopped \u2013 plus thyme, bay, tomato puree and a nip of saffron. Fry the fish in olive oil, and I mean really fry it, because if you don\u2019t get some colour on it now, your soup will end up paler than Macauley Culkin after a two-day bender. Bosi takes it even further: \u201cFry it until it starts to break down.\u201d\n\nBosi now adds the raw soup veg, while Harris browns it separately first. Fry some more, then stir in tomato puree before adding any liquid. Bosi opts for a litre of fish stock, but Harris turns the dial right up by adding a third of a bottle of red wine and reducing by half, repeats that with a can of tomatoes, and only then adds stock, his preference being for chicken. Season generously \u2013 \u201cnow\u2019s not the time to be shy,\u201d Bosi orders \u2013 then cook gently for up to an hour and a half.\n\nBosi and Harris are adamant that the soup must now be passed first through a food mill, then through a sieve and, ideally, again through muslin \u2013 see what they mean by time-consuming? \u2013 and never, ever blend it, both chefs warn, because that blitzes the fish skeletons into tiny bone fragments, which give the soup \u201ca deeply unpleasant, gritty texture\u201d, Harris explains. \u201cIgnore anyone who tells you otherwise, professional or not. That includes John Wayne \u2013 yes, that John Wayne \u2013 who fancied himself so much in the kitchen that he wrote a couple of cookbooks.\u201d Where soupe de poissons is concerned, at least, blending is cowboy behaviour of the very worst kind.\n\n\u2022 Do you have a culinary dilemma?
