LOUIS (AP) - A Missouri appeals court has overturned a $110 million verdict in a case alleging that Johnson & Johnson products containing talcum powder caused a Virginia woman\u2019s ovarian cancer.\n\nThe appeals court ruling Tuesday reversed a 2017 judgment on behalf of Lois Slemp. She is among many women whose lawsuits have claimed that Johnson & Johnson\u2019s talcum powder contributed to their cancer.\n\nJohnson & Johnson says its Baby Powder is safe and does not cause cancer.\n\nThe appeals court ruling says that the St. Louis court where the case was heard lacked jurisdiction, noting that talc products used by Slemp were made in Georgia and purchased and used in Virginia.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear if an appeal is planned. Slemp\u2019s attorney didn\u2019t immediately return a phone message seeking comment.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A Missouri appeals court has overturned a $110 million verdict in a case alleging that Johnson & Johnson products containing talcum powder caused a Virginia woman's ovarian cancer.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
