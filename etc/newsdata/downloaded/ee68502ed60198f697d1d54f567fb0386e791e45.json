It also linked anti-Semitism to denunciations of Israel as well as the Palestinian-led Boycott Divestment Sanctions (BDS) movement, which calls for a boycott of all Israeli products.\n\nThe report stressed that the \"prevalence of anti-Semitic attitudes and the risk of violence against Jewish individuals and sites \" is significant.\n\nThe report, \u201cCombating Antisemitism to Eliminate Discrimination and Intolerance Based on Religion or Belief,\u201d was released on Monday by U.N. Human Rights Council's special rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, Ahmed Shaheed.\n\nThe special rapporteur recognized that the sources of anti-Semitism are varied and pointed out what he thinks are the three main strains:\n\nThey are: \"growing use of anti-Semitic tropes by white supremacists including neo-Nazis and members of radical Islamist groups\"; an increase in \"anti-Semitic narratives or tropes in the course of expressing anger at policies or practices of the government of Israel\"; and yhe objectives, activities and effects of the Boycott Divestment Sanctions (BDS) movement.\"\n\nThe report said that \u201canti-Semitic hate speech is particularly prevalent online.\u201d\n\nIt also made mention of several exceptionally violent incidents that \u201chave had an outsized impact on Jewish individuals\u2019 sense of security in recent years.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, the report mentioned the 2018 attack at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, where a gunman opened fire and killed 11 congregants \u201cin the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history.\u201d\n\nPITTSBURGH SYNAGOGUE SHOOTING LEAVES 11 DEAD AND 6 WOUNDED; SUSPECT HIT WITH MULTIPLE CHARGES\n\nThe report noted that the gunman\u2019s \u201ccomments during the attack and social media activity on the days preceding it revealed a belief in a host of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories rooted in a far-right, white supremacist ideology.\u201d\n\nIt pointed out that about six months later, \u201ca gunman similarly motivated by white supremacist ideology killed one congregant and wounded three others at a synagogue in the Poway California community.\u201d\n\nIn that case, police said the 19-year-old man armed with an assault-type rifle opened fire inside the Southern California synagogue in April as worshipers prepared to celebrate the last day of Passover.\n\nThe special rapporteur also said he \u201creceived numerous accounts concerning vandalism and desecration of Jewish synagogues and cemeteries, as well as other recognizably Jewish sites.\u201d\n\nThe report urged states to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) working definition of anti-Semitism as a global guide for identifying, monitoring, and responding to incidents.\n\nThe working definition was adopted by the alliance in 2016 and was developed as a tool \u201cto facilitate more accurate and uniform monitoring of anti-Semitism\u201d as well as to educate officials and the public about the different forms of anti-Semitism.\n\nThe report said, \u201cThe working definition defines anti-Semitism generally as: \u2018a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations ... are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe report said that in the U.S. in 2017, 58 percent of religiously-motivated bias \"were driven by anti-Ssemitic bias,\" The Permanent Mission of Israel to the U.N. noted, adding that it also said that governments enact laws and policies that restrict Jewish practice, including limiting kosher slaughter methods or preventing Jewish people from political participation in higher office.\n\nUN ANTI-RACISM PANEL CHALLENGES PALESTINIANS ON ALLEGED 'SCHOOLBOOK HATE'\n\nThe release of the report comes about one month after IMPACT-se, a research and policy institute that analyzes how textbooks measure up to (UNESCO) standards for acceptance, peace and tolerance, and other watchdog organizations, including Jerusalem-based research institute NGO Monitor, presented examples of anti-Israeli and anti-Jewish content in Palestinian textbooks at the 99th session of the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nAnne Herzberg, legal adviser and U.N. liaison at NGO Monitor, told Fox News: \u201cIt is interesting that this is the second time in such a short period that we see a shift away from the usual anti-Israel tone of U.N. institutions.\u201d\n\nShe said the release of Shaheed\u2019s report comes after NGO Monitor made a submission to the rapporteur and met with him in Geneva.\n\n\"This report marks one of the first times the U.N. has addressed the issue of anti-Semitism in any detail,\u201d Herzberg said.\n\n\u201cThe special rapporteur condemned the use of anti-Semitic tropes and denial of Israel's right to exist by BDS activists.\u201d\n\nSTATE DEPT.
