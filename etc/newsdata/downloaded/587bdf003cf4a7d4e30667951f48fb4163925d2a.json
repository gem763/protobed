He will target companies that can achieve profitability more quickly, said the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private.\n\nThe change is driven by the market's response to past Vision Fund investments. The failure of WeWork to go public, combined with the lackluster performances of other SoftBank investments, such as Uber and Slack, has put the Vision Fund under a microscope as it attempts to raise billions more for a second fund. SoftBank, in conjunction with the Vision Fund, has invested about $10.6 billion in WeWork.\n\nSon plans to take an even more active role with the selection of new investments as scrutiny on Vision Fund 2 intensifies, said the people. However, his shift in focus should be viewed as temporary and could shift if market conditions change, two of the people said.\n\nA SoftBank Vision Fund spokesman declined to comment.", "description": "SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son plans to target technology companies with clearer paths to profitability as it fundraises for Vision Fund 2, a reaction to the market's response to past investments Uber and WeWork, sources say.", "authors": ["Alex Sherman"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105113062-GettyImages-870900354.jpg?v=1532563659", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
