A Gypsy Summer, they call it in those parts. Which hints at a lot.\n\nThe Grand Hotel, the interior walls of which are festooned with testimonies from famous guests, is a brisk 15-minute stroll from the Vasil Levski Stadium.\n\nStraight down the main road, past Starbucks and a couple of checkpoints from the old Communist days, preserved for posterity.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nNot for the UEFA official. He is not just a VIP but a VVIP.\n\nThat mile is a long way wheeling your Louis Vuitton cabin baggage behind you.\n\nWhich is why he will be going to the ground behind the tinted windows of a stretch Mercedes.\n\nBut not before he has taken care of one important piece of housekeeping.\n\nA suitably subservient chap needs to take the UEFA bigwig\u2019s order before he lowers himself into the limo.\n\nHis order for dinner when he arrives at the venue in five minutes\u2019 time, that is.\n\nFillet steak. Rare. Rare. Make sure it is rare, he repeats a couple of times, just in case there are any doubts.\n\nAnd in he gets. On his way to eating the finest barely-cooked Bulgarian beef while football burns.\n\nAs starters are served, the black-shirted bigots congregate in the cheap seats.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nReplete with the nicest cuts of cattle, maybe even a button of his jacket raffishly undone, the UEFA official and his fellow diners watch and listen as England\u2019s black players are racially abused by the meat-heads.\n\nAnd. They. Do. Nothing.\n\nIt is left to Ivan Bebek, a fine referee with a lot more on his plate than a chunk of livestock a decent vet might save.\n\nIt is left to young men, who have come here just to play football, not to gorge on hospitality.\n\nIt is left to Gareth Southgate, a manager now not only concerned about formation but about the sensitivities of nations.\n\nShould the referee have taken the teams off? Should the players have walked off? Should Southgate have ordered his side off?\n\nThe arguments are irrelevant.\n\nEngland\u2019s players, admirably, said that if one player wanted to walk off, they would all walk off.\n\nBut like it or not, the players have vested interests. Would Tyrone Mings, despite the vile abuse, have wanted his debut to be a pockmark in football\u2019s record books?\n\n(Image: Eddie Keogh for The FA/REX)\n\nWould Ross Barkley have wanted his two goals to be scrubbed from national statistics?\n\nWould Harry Kane have wanted to look a goalscoring gift horse in its ugly mouth?\n\nThe players, the managers, the referee - these are people with an emotionally vested interest in the game.\n\nAs a white, middle-aged man, I\u2019m not going to tell young black men what they should and should not do when assaulted by abhorrent abuse.\n\nBut it should have been out of their hands on Monday.\n\nIt is all well and good UEFA charging and punishing national associations.\n\nIt is all well and good having protocols.\n\nBut the UEFA officials digesting dinner in the stands of a bleak arena heard every bit of abuse, saw every disgusting gesture.\n\n(Image: Sportimage)\n\nAnd the bottom line is they should not be just looking on and then filing a report after doing their expenses.\n\nMonday night in Sofia should be a watershed moment.\n\nFrom now on, never mind protocols.\n\nWhatever organisation has the game under its authority - UEFA, in this instance - should have the sole power to call it off when its representatives have heard the abuse.\n\nThe man in the Merc who ate well should have dragged the teams off on Monday. He heard it all, he saw it all. He had the best seat in the house.\n\nIt was just a shame he was probably looking at the dessert menu.", "description": "The organisation have received widespread criticism for not coming down strong enough on racist abuse at football", "authors": ["Andy Dunn", "Image", "Getty Images", "Pa", "Eddie Keogh For The Fa Rex", "Sportimage"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20637784.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_AGP_MDM_161019UEFA_006JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
