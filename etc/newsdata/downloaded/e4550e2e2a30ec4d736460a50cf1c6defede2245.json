You will be held accountable,\" she said, warning that \"continued efforts to hide the truth of the president's abuse of power from the American people will be regarded as further evidence of obstruction.\"\n\nPelosi formally launched the impeachment inquiry last month after revelations that Trump pressured Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July 25 phone call.\n\nThe stand-off risks a constitutional crisis, with the potential for a court showdown just as the US gears up for the 2020 election.\n\nThe House of Representatives launched an official impeachment investigation of President Donald Trump last month after he encouraged a foreign leader to conduct a probe that could damage a political rival. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said at the time that no one was above the law. [Kevin Lamarque/Reuters]\n\nObstruction\n\nThe White House letter followed Trump's move to bar a key witness, Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, from speaking to Congress -- calling it a \"totally compromised kangaroo court.\"\n\n\u201cIt is an obstruction of the clear constitutional right and responsibility of Congress to investigate the executive branch,\u201d Jeff Hauser, a lawyer and executive director of the Revolving Door Project at the Center for Economic and Policy Research. told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cCongress is the only organ of government that has the clear right to remove a high official including the president and if their ability to do that is being impeded by the president and if their ability to investigate misconduct by the president and his team is being impeded that is clearly, in and of itself, impeachable behaviour.\u201d\n\nIn response to Trump's move, Democrats issued Sondland, a Trump donor who only started in his job in the EU in July, with a subpoena that \"compels\" him to appear on October 16.\n\nThe investigators are interested in what the ambassador knew and what his role was in Trump's efforts to get Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, who is one of the leading potential challengers to the Republican president.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry is focused on a whistle-blower's allegation that Trump used nearly $400m in US military aid to secure a promise from Ukraine's president to investigate Biden, a leading candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, and his son.\n\nThere has been no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens. Trump has rejected the allegations.\n\nThe whistle-blower's legal team is in the final stages of talks for him to speak to Democratic and Republican-led congressional intelligence committees as early as this week, congressional officials said.\n\nAdam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee spearheading the impeachment inquiry, told reporters the move to block Sondland from testifying or turning over his text messages or emails was obstruction.\n\n\"We will consider this act today ... to be further acts of obstruction of a co-equal branch of government,\" Schiff told reporters.\n\nThe eight-page letter from White House counsel Pat Cipollone claimed the impeachment investigation was \"illegitimate\".

Yovanovitch was the US ambassador to Ukraine until Trump cut short her term and recalled her in May.\n\nFollowing the White House letter, members of the Trump administration would not be authorised to testify in Congress and would ignore subpoenas, a senior administration official told reporters.\n\nHe insisted that the White House was \"definitely avoiding saying there's no way we'd ever cooperate,\" but he declined to discuss \"hypothetical situations\" in which a change might take place.", "description": "White House attacks congressional panels leading probe in eight-page letter after barring EU ambassador from testifying.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/9/270b29e3ec774f398cb7747cfac55e91_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
