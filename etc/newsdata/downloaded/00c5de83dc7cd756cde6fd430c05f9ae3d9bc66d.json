Install load management devices for industrial geysers used in hotels and similar equipment.\n\nOne solution is to install load-management devices for industrial geysers, and other heavy equipment, used in hotels and guest houses. The technology to do so has been around for five years, but never implemented by Eskom, Blom says.\n\n\u201cIt could immediately put us out of Stage 2. This is new technology that can automatically monitor the system and switch off the heavy-usage equipment,\u201d says Blom.\n\nBy the time municipalities detect trouble on the grid \u2013 and send out \"off\" signals to ripple switches such as those found in some home geysers \u2013 it is too late, Blom says. But newer systems can detect strain on the power grid, immediately throttle back geysers, and then bring them slowly back online when things get better.\n\nThese should be mandatory around the country, Blom says.\n\n2. Cut 30,000 \"unnecessary\" jobs at Eskom.\n\nBlom maintains that Eskom is seriously overstaffed, and needs the money it pays those people for other purposes.\n\nEskom can start with managerial positions, he says, cutting back on those who are not hands-on in running power stations.\n\n3. Spend cash freed up \u2013 say from a salary bill \u2013 on parts and maintenance.\n\n\u201cProper servicing has not been done since 2010,\" says Blom.\n\n\"For four years hardly any servicing took place and for the balance of the years it\u2019s been patch jobs. Half the stations are offline because they haven\u2019t got parts.\u201d\n\nPutting money into maintenance will show immediate returns, he believes.\n\n4. Stop relying on backup diesel and short-term coal contracts.\n\nInstead of longer-term agreements on coal, Eskom tends to pay high rates for emergency coal supplies, Blom says. When that fails it turns to diesel to run open cycle gas turbines at Ankerlig and Gourikwa.\n\nBoth the short-term coal contracts and the huge diesel generators are supposed to be emergency measures, but are regularly used, Blom says.\n\nSorting out coal in the first place will save huge amounts of money, and reduce uncertainty.\n\nFor more, go to Business Insider South Africa.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "Energy expert Ted Blom says Eskom has four quick wins that can save South Africa from further load shedding.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9482/ef9b7f2f42b549309ad903f4630baec5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
