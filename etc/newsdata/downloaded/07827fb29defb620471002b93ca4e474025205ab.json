Bush was president, \u201cFriends\u201d was in its ninth season, and Pete Buttigieg was 20 years old, studying for his undergraduate degree at Harvard University.\n\nInterested in Democratic Party?

Add Interest\n\n\u201cI remember him outside of our dorm with sideburns and a guitar and a case with a lot of stickers on it,\u201d Steven Koh, Buttigieg\u2019s dormitory roommate, said. \u201cFive or six\u2026 of us all lived together all four years of college. Within that group, Peter was really the one who was the keeper of the traditions and the keeper of the flame.\u201d\n\nAs part of ABC News\u2019 new series, \u201cThe Contenders at 20,\u201d Buttigieg\u2019s classmates from Harvard fondly remember the unexpected talents he developed.\n\n\u201cAt some point, Peter acquired a didgeridoo, an Australian Aboriginal instrument,\u201d Koh said. \u201cNot only could he generate a tone with it, but he also taught himself circular breathing so that he could continuously breathe in and out while blowing on the didgeridoo, which meant that he could hold this note continuously forever, it seemed. It's classic Peter.\u201d\n\nABC\n\nMike Deogracias, who went to high school with Buttigieg, said he loved \u201cthe claw game -- the thing that comes down to pick up toys.\u201d\n\nWatch the full story on \"Nightline\" TONIGHT at 12:35 a.m. ET on ABC\n\n\u201cOftentimes, I'd go to Walmart and he would be there, playing the game \u2014 you know, winning something and giving it to a kid,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody can, like, really win the claw game, and he perfected it.\u201d\n\nABC\n\n\u201cI think his reputation when we were younger was \u2018the really smart neighbor boy next door that went to Harvard,\u2019\u201d Elise King, Buttigieg\u2019s childhood neighbor, said. \u201cHe's not someone that's gonna kind of be that bull in the china shop, just saying something to say something.\u201d\n\nButtigieg turned 20 years old just months after 9/11. Twelve years later, he served in Afghanistan as a naval intelligence officer.\n\n\u201cSeptember 11th happened during our sophomore year,\u201d Koh said. \u201cA bunch of us were sitting together in the dorm room watching the towers burn and then collapse. Peter and I were together with a few other roommates and that was obviously the formative political moment for all of us in college.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he always was interested in politics, always had that public service drive. But then September 11th added a level of gravity and probably a level of urgency to some of those interests,\u201d he added.\n\nButtigieg\u2019s classmate Andy Frank said that \u201cafter 9/11, there was a lot of hope that this could be a uniting thing for our country. When that didn\u2019t happen and the Iraq war became very politicized, that was disillusioning for many people at Harvard, including myself and including Pete.\u201d\n\nABC\n\nFrank said that Buttigieg, who studied history and literature at Harvard, \u201ccared about language being used in an honest way.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that what disturbed him the most was how language had been abused in that era,\u201d Frank said. \u201cThe real-life consequences of that abuse.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Buttigieg was involved with the Institute of Politics, which is part of Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government. Frank said it was a place where people on campus could go to \u201cgrill a world leader.\u201d\n\nAnd in 2003, Buttigieg did just that, questioning Senator Ted Kennedy.\n\n\u201cIt feels like a lot of your colleagues have adopted a posture of being for whatever the Republicans are for, only less. The tax cuts, just a smaller one, and the war \u2014 maybe not quite as quick as the Republican war. And there are voices like your own which are more forceful in opposition,\u201d Buttigieg said at the time. \u201cI wonder if you see this is as a split in the Democratic party and how you think, politically speaking, in the next few years your party's going to sort out what it thinks the meaning of \u2018opposition\u2019 is\u201d\n\nFrank called Buttigieg\u2019s questioning \u201cquintessential Pete,\u201d noting that he \u201ccut through a lot of the noise\u201d and \u201casked the real question of the day.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Frank recalled that at the time, the Democratic Party had a lukewarm approach to marriage equality.\n\n\u201cEven the Democratic Party was, well, \u2018We don\u2019t want to\u2026discriminate against the gays\u2026but\u2026we also aren\u2019t going to do gay marriage\u2026 Maybe something like a civil union,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cNobody thought it was realistic that a gay American could be elected to higher office. At the time, you know, you had George Bush and the Republicans basically running on antigay slogans.\u201d\n\nDeogracias, King, Koh and Frank each said they didn\u2019t know Buttigieg was gay at the time.\n\n\u201cI didn't know Peter was gay in college. I don't think any of us suspected either,\u201d Koh said. \u201cHe had a girlfriend freshman year. He had a girlfriend [in] senior year. At the time, Peter must have felt like he was really in a very difficult place. It wouldn't have made any difference to me or any of our friends. And it doesn't make any difference to us now.\u201d\n\nSame-sex marriage was still illegal in the United States in 2002. It wasn\u2019t until 2015 that the Supreme Court struck down all state bans on same-sex marriage. That was also the year that Buttigieg, at 33 years old, came out as gay. He married his husband Chasten in 2018.\n\n\u201cBeing gay is just another part of him, like having brown hair or being Maltese,\u201d Frank said.\n\n\u201cGrowing up in South Bend at that time, I do think it would've been pretty difficult to come out as gay,\u201d King said. \u201cI can't say that I had any friends growing up that came out in high school.\u201d\n\nABC\n\nKing also shared her memories of Buttigieg and his family.\n\nKing said that the community in South Bend, Indiana, \u201cwas very and still is very family-oriented.\u201d\n\n\u201cPete's parents are incredibly kind. His mom did a lot of paintings; she was really generous,\u201d King said. \u201cHis dad was extremely jovial. He would kind of sit on the back porch just kind of giving this, like, hearty laugh. He was also a man of deep intellect.\u201d\n\nObtained by ABC News\n\nButtigieg would go to University of Notre Dame football games with his dad, who taught there, Deogracias said. \u201cI think Peter had a really good relationship with his parents,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHe was an only child and so he spent a lot of time just with his parents, having really deep, sophisticated conversations,\u201d King said.\n\nObtained by ABC News\n\n\u201cI remember him saying at a dinner right before graduation, \u2018I didn't grow up with brothers but I feel like I have them now,\u2019\u201d Koh added. \u201cThere's something about meeting someone at the age of 17 that just really marks who you are. And that runs pretty deep all those years later.\u201d", "description": "\u201cI think his reputation when we were younger was \u2018the really smart neighbor boy next door that went to Harvard,\u2019\u201d Elise King, Buttigieg\u2019s childhood neighbor, said.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/pete-college-mike-ht-ay-190911_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
