Although Locksley eased up after a 64-yard touchdown run by Javon Leake early in the third quarter, the Terrapins finished with 29 first downs and 354 yards rushing.\n\nIt was the most lopsided victory by an unranked team over a ranked team since Oklahoma beat No. 13 Texas A&M 51-13 on Oct. 23, 1999.\n\nLocksley came to Maryland after serving as offensive coordinator at Alabama, and Jackson transferred from Virginia Tech in February. The two have teamed to form a quick-strike offense that is equally effective on the ground and through the air.\n\nJackson completed 21 of 38 passes, attempting only two throws in the fourth quarter. He has tossed seven TD passes in two games with one interception.\n\n\u201cOur style of play, it\u2019s hard to match it - our tempo and the way we executed it,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of what we expect. None of us thought this was a surprise for us to be able to put up points.\u201d\n\nAnthony McFarland Jr. ran for two scores and caught a 6-yard TD pass from Jackson during a sparkling first half in which the Terrapins amassed 397 yards and built a 29-point lead against a Syracuse team coming off a season-opening shutout of Liberty.\n\n\u201cObviously, we\u2019re not as good as the first game, and I would like to think we\u2019re not as bad as the second game,\u201d said Orange coach Dino Babers, insisting that the defense will ultimately be the strength of the team.\n\nPerhaps, but on this day Syracuse was constantly in pursuit of wide open receivers and trying to chase down runners past the line of scrimmage. And when they caught up to them, it often wasn\u2019t good enough.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of missed tackles,\u201d Babers lamented. \u201cAnd when you have missed tackles on a defense, you\u2019re going to get guys extend plays.\u201d\n\nMissed tackles aside, Maryland\u2019s offense presents plenty of problems because Jackson is a skilled passer and a threat to run, and he\u2019s got a host of capable running backs behind him.\n\n\u201cWe run a style of offense that the defense can\u2019t be right unless they out-execute us,\u201d Locksley said.\n\nA 7-yard touchdown pass from Jackson to Tyler Mabry, a Syracuse turnover and a 3-yard run by McFarland made it 14-0 with less than 6 minutes elapsed.\n\nIt was 14-7 before Leake ran for a score and McFarland followed a turnover by the Orange with a 20-yard TD run for a 28-7 lead.\n\nThat was enough offense to beat a Syracuse attack led by redshirt sophomore Tommy DeVito, who went 28 for 39 for 330 yards and three touchdowns. But he lost a fumble and threw an interception, turnovers that Maryland converted into scores.\n\nPRESSURE DOWNS\n\nMaryland went 11 for 15 in turning third downs into first downs, including 8 for 9 in the first half.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an amazing statistic, no matter who you\u2019re playing,\u201d Babers said. \u201cThat is not indicative of our defense. We\u2019re normally fantastic on third down.\u201d\n\nSyracuse was 6 for 15 on third down and failed to convert any of its three fourth-down tries.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nSyracuse appears poised to exit the Top 25 after opening at No. 22 and jumping a notch last week.\n\n\u201cThis is definitely humble pie,\u201d Babers said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it tastes like, but it probably tastes exactly the way I feel right now.\u201d\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nSyracuse: The defense couldn\u2019t stop the run and was helpless against the pass. DeVito got off some decent throws when given time in the pocket but does not fare well under pressure.\n\nMaryland: There\u2019s no denying that this offense is electric and Jackson is best suited to run it.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMaryland\u2019s first road game is at Temple, which opened with a 56-12 rout of Bucknell before getting a bye this week.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Josh Jackson threw for 296 yards and three touchdowns to anchor another prolific offensive performance by Maryland, which beat No. 21 Syracuse 63-20.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Ginsburg"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/07/syracuse_maryland_football_25396_c0-203-4928-3076_s1770x1032.jpg?851f51b6135813e8f0fc2c85d5a4529f78fa139b", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
