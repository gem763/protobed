USA TODAY\n\nAn ugly loss for the Atlanta Falcons got worse after it ended on Sunday.\n\nAfter dropping to 1-4 with a 53-32 beating against the Texans, Houston\u2019s players didn\u2019t shy away from pointing out flaws in what they saw from Atlanta\u2019s defense.\n\n\u201cWe knew they were a pretty basic defense that wasn\u2019t going to do too much,\u201d Texans receiver Keke Coutee said after the game, according to the Houston Chronicle. \u201cThey were going to keep running the same thing over and over. Once we kind of found out their kinks they had, we just started capitalizing on our opportunities.\u201d\n\nQuarterback Deshaun Watson posted a perfect passer rating of 158.3 after he completed 28 of 33 passes for 426 yards and five touchdowns. He became the first player in NFL history to throw for at least 400 yards and five scores in a single game in which he had five or fewer incompletions.\n\n\u201cWhen we were going uptempo, you\u2019d see their D-linemen gassed out, hands on their hips, tired,\u201d Texans running back Carlos Hyde said, also according to the Houston Chronicle. \u201cWhen you see that, you want to put the foot on the pedal and go fast. It opens up big plays. They were still playing hard. They didn\u2019t give up.\u201d\n\nThe Falcons sit in last place in the NFC South, just three seasons after they made a trip to Super Bowl LI.\n\nOn offense, the team has been good in spurts, but far too inconsistent. Quarterback Matt Ryan has completed 70.3% of his passes for 1,655 yards and 11 touchdowns, but has thrown seven interceptions.\n\nDespite the slow start, team ownership pledged its support for head coach Dan Quinn.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Falcons owner Arthur Blank told ESPN after the game when asked if he thought a coaching change was needed. \u201cWe've got a lot of football left. This staff has performed before. And my hope is they can fix what needs to be fixed and start winning some games.\u201d\n\nA defensive specialist, Quinn spent two seasons as the defensive coordinator of the Seattle Seahawks before taking the Falcons job in February 2015.\n\nNext week, the Falcons look to rectify some of their issues on the road against the Arizona Cardinals.\n\nFollow Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes.", "description": "After a lopsided 53-32 loss against the Texans, Houston's players pointed out flaws in the defense of the Atlanta Falcons.", "authors": ["Lorenzo Reyes", "Published P.M.
