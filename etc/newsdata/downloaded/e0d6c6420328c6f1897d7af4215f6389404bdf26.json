What they should be concerned about is what can they actually afford. If they lose their job will they be able to sell their property?\" he said.\n\nThe ratio of housing debt to income jumped to a record high of more than 140 per cent in the June quarter, according to RBA figures.\n\nAt around the same time, home lending in July jumped 5.1 per cent, the biggest monthly gain in four years, the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) report says.\n\nMortgage broker Justin Doobov, of Intelligent Finance, said the extra borrowing capacity as a result of three interest rate cuts would only be \"marginally better\" given lenders' extra scrutiny over loan applications.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The amount the bank will lend has only improved by about 5 per cent. While the lower interest rates, lower assessment rates might improve a borrower's position, how the lenders are now weighting living expenses is probably balancing that back out,\" Mr Doobov said.\n\nWhile lending conditions remain constrained, Mr Doobov said he still had to explain to clients that while they are cheering the low rates, it was a sign the Australian economy was fragile.\n\n\"I do remind people that, yes it's great, [money] is cheap, but you've got to make sure you can keep your job. And if you're self employed, you got to make sure that your customers will keep buying from you. Because if you don't have income coming in it doesn't matter how cheap it is, you won't be able to afford the repayments,\" he said.\n\nMr Doobov said the biggest factor sparking growth in the market currently was the lack of properties, which he expected would push property prices up 5 per cent by Christmas.\n\nIn just four months, since the end of the downturn in May, prices in both Sydney and Melbourne have increased 3.6 per cent.\n\nWhile investors were similarly eager to borrow, they were facing bigger challenges, property investment advisor Victor Kumar, of Right Property Group, said.\n\n\"People want to invest but they still haven't recovered from their equity loss if they bought at the peak of the market,\" Mr Kumar said.\n\nThe share of investor lending as a proportion of total mortgages has been declining, fallingn to 25.9 per cent in June from its November 2016 peak of 37.9 per cent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Even though the assessment rates have been dropped by the banks, and the interest rates have come down as well, a majority of them still can't qualify for the level of finance that they need to get back into the market. People who already have a couple of investment properties are finding that the banks are looking at [those properties] more as a risk than as an asset.\"\n\nEducated investors weren't deterred by a weaker economy and were willing to continue borrowing, but were changing the type of property they were buying to mitigate their risk, Mr Kumar said.\n\n\"They're looking at value-add properties, dual occupancies or zoned land, so that if the market goes against them, then they've got several strategies to implement on that property,\" he said.\n\n\"Equally, I'm seeing a lot of people extracting equity from the home and diving back into the share market as well, just to hedge their bets.\"\n\nPete Wargent, co-founder of property investment advisory firm Allen Wargent, said when banks lend more, people tend to accept it.\n\n\"For people who are in the market already, they might be more inclined to start paying down debt with the extra money rather than spending it. But I think for new borrowers, in a rising market, if the borrowing capacity goes up it's most likely their inclination to borrow more does too.\"", "description": "Australians are already paying silly prices for properties that don't deserve such prices, one buyer's agent says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2038%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_97/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b7b05c3b531b39dd08f4abdd3a9095661b9a424e", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
