Ryan ten Doeschate, the Essex\u2019s captain, sat in the shower, stewing.\n\nIt was the summer of 2017, and, with Essex hunting their first County Championship title in 25 years, ten Doeschate feared that the side were squandering a dominant position in the match.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want the players to see my frustration,\u201d ten Doeschate recalls. Instead, he sought out Chris Silverwood: then Essex head coach, and now England's.\n\n\u201cI vented to him privately. He burst out laughing, put his arm around me and told me: 'chill out'.\u201d\n\nWhen the rain stopped, ten Doeschate made 88, marshalling the tail adroitly to ensure Essex got a three-figure lead, setting up an emphatic victory.\n\nIt is providing calm in pressurised situations that ten Doeschate considers Silverwood\u2019s greatest attribute. \u201cHis biggest quality is to take the pressure away from the players. It's the most basic and most important skill as a coach, not easily implemented but one that he had mastered from the start.\u201d", "description": "While the rain lashed down at Scarborough.", "authors": ["Tim Wigmore", "Michael Vaughan", "Simon Heffer"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/cricket/2019/10/07/TELEMMGLPICT000212296158-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqnovVTiJx1-CJOCPnC8SeZ5Z48lCsLG6iwEVAhLMAVqM.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
