Featuring in the magazine's September issue, the pair's cover story shoot reveals a combination of quirky retro stylings, brightly colored interiors and an abundance of plant life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 5 Models Cara and Poppy Delevingne opened the doors to their L.A. mansion.

Poppy, a successful model in her own right, also worked for the British brand, in addition to fronting campaigns for the likes of Louis Vuitton.\n\n\"L.A. can be a lonely place,\" Cara told the magazine, explaining the pair's decision to live together. \"You really have to make an effort to reach out to people. Since one of us was always coming here for one reason or another, being with family just made sense.\"\n\n\"This was the chance to build our dream sister house,\" Poppy added. \"Miraculously, we're still talking.\"\n\nThe result is a two-story mansion decked out in vibrant pinks, emeralds and leaf print. Their eclectic furnishings and interiors include designs by US brands like Serena & Lily, Donghia and Bakarian Studio.\n\nThe bathroom was inspired by Mexican telavera ceramics.

Whereas Poppy's room boasts tropical wallpaper (hand-painted by British interiors firm De Gournay), Cara's is altogether more sultry, with gold fittings, patterned red carpet and bespoke wall coverings -- and not to mention an 11-foot-wide bed atop a mirrored platform.\n\n\"Poppy has more of an eye than I do,\" Cara told the magazine of their aesthetic sensibilities. \"She has impeccable taste, so I let her take the lead on the d\u00e9cor.\"\n\n\"Basically, I'm a control freak,\" Poppy added. \"We each made our imprint on the design, but I was the one obsessing over the color of the curtain rings.\"", "description": "The 26-year-old British model and actress offered Architectural Digest an exclusive look inside the California home she shares with her older sister -- and fellow model -- Poppy.", "authors": ["Oscar Holland"], "top_image": "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190805173303-cara-poppy-delevingne-tease-super-tease.jpg"}
