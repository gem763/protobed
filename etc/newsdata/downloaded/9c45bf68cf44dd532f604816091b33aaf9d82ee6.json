Mount is now being picked in England squads and his impressive performances for Chelsea this season are proving to be a problem for Pulisic.\n\nFor the league match against Liverpool on Sept. 22, Mount was a major doubt ahead of the game with an ankle injury, yet still started ahead of Pulisic - and played the whole match. He has played the full 90 minutes in all of Chelsea\u2019s league games this season.\n\nThe sheer number of fixtures on Chelsea\u2019s schedule means the 21-year-old Pulisic will get game time this season. Yet his minutes might be fleeting in the league - as they were for a long spell at Borussia Dortmund last season following the emergence of another English star in the making, Jadon Sancho - and he may have to be content with starts in the domestic cup competitions.\n\nNot exactly what the American would have expected in his first season in English soccer.\n\nBRUCE\u2019S STRUGGLES\n\nSpeaking of difficult first seasons at a club, Steve Bruce is already looking weighed down by the task of keeping hometown club Newcastle in the Premier League.\n\nBruce spoke of \u201ca complete surrender\u201d and having \u201cas bad an afternoon as I can remember\u201d after Newcastle\u2019s 5-0 loss at Leicester on Sunday.\n\nNewcastle has won one of its first seven matches - somewhat surprisingly at Tottenham last month - and the team is in next-to-last place in the league.\n\nThe northeast club managed to stay in the top flight the last few seasons because of the managerial prowess of Rafa Benitez, who failed to agree to a new deal with Newcastle in the offseason and left to manage in China.\n\nThe first few months under Bruce only serve to highlight what a brilliant job Benitez actually did at St. James\u2019 Park.\n\n\u201cI have heard lots of nonsense about tactics but the big thing is about showing pride and having a go,\u201d Bruce said.\n\nThat\u2019s one thing Benitez would never say. Newcastle fans should be concerned.\n\nSTAT ATTACK\n\nWith his double against Newcastle, Leicester striker Jamie Vardy took his overall tally of Premier League goals to 85 - one more than Cristiano Ronaldo scored in England\u2019s top division at Manchester United.\n\nVardy has scored his haul in 183 games, while Ronaldo took 196 games.\n\nThere are, of course, caveats: Ronaldo was largely played as a winger and was at the start of his career when at United.\n\nStill, they are impressive numbers for the 32-year-old Vardy, who was playing in England\u2019s non-leagues until 2012. One of the fastest strikers in England, he is showing no sign of slowing down when it comes to scoring.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nSteve Douglas is at www.twitter.com/sdouglas80\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The group stage of the Champions League is only one round old and already Chelsea faces a match it cannot afford to lose.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Douglas"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/30/england_weekend_watch_68142_c0-192-3689-2342_s1770x1032.jpg?4832d5be1a248e75666173e44b63fce75c49281c", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
