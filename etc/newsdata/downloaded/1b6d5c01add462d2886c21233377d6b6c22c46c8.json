(AP) - Tampa Bay goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy said \u201cthe wait was well worth it\u201d after it took a long video review to confirm a victory over Pittsburgh.\n\nVasilevskiy made an outstanding save as regulation ended after Victor Hedman scored a power-play goal with 56.8 seconds remaining to give the Lightning a 3-2 victory over the Penguins on Wednesday night.\n\nLast year\u2019s Vezina Trophy winner dove head-first into the crease and made a sweeping glove stop on Kris Letang\u2019s shot.\n\n\u201cThere was a big scramble,\u201d Vasilevskiy said. \u201cI just tried to cover the bottom of the net, seal the ice and he just shot into my glove. Kind of never give-up play. It works sometimes \u2026 not every time, though.\u201d\n\nReplays showed that part of Vasilevskiy\u2019s glove was past the goal line but it wasn\u2019t clear if the puck completely crossed over, too.\n\n\u201cIt looks like it\u2019s in his webbing and for a split second it looked like his webbing is over the line,\u201d Penguins center Sidney Crosby said. \u201cSo maybe they can\u2019t tell based on being in his glove.\u201d\n\nHedman felt the longer the delay lasted, the better it was for the Lightning.\n\n\u201cI was confident the whole way,\u201d Hedman said. \u201cThat was a big save.\u201d\n\nHedman scored from just inside the blue line off Steven Stamkos\u2019 pass from the left circle.\n\nThe Lightning went 1 for 4 on the power play, with two coming in the last five minutes of play. Pittsburgh failed to score on its one chance.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately you\u2019ve got to kill all those (penalties),\u201d Crosby said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we deserved all those. It\u2019s not like they dominated and had the puck that much more than we did. You think we have drew a few more.\u201d\n\nAlex Killorn and Cedric Paquette also scored, and Vasilevskiy made 37 saves.\n\nBrandon Tanev and Jake Guentzel scored and Tristan Jarry stopped 45 shots for the Penguins. Crosby picked up an assist and moved past Norm Ullman into sole possession of 40th place on the NHL career points list with 1,230.\n\nThe injury-depleted Penguins are without forwards Evgeni Malkin, Alex Galchenyuk, Nick Bjugstad and Bryan Rust, and defensemen Brian Dumoulin and Zach Trotman. Malkin has 23 goals and 51 points in 38 games against Tampa Bay.\n\nPaquette, who played for the first time this season after being sidelined by an upper-body injury, tied it at 2 on a deflection at 7:07 of the third.\n\nTanev skated out from behind the net and scored on a backhander at 5:06 of the second before Guentzel scored off a pass through the slot from Crosby to put Pittsburgh up 2-1 with 58.8 seconds left in the period.\n\nCrosby has 34 assists and 53 points in 40 games against the Lightning.\n\nPittsburgh has 19 second-period goals in 11 games this season.\n\nKillorn opened the scoring midway through the first by redirecting Nikita Kucherov\u2019s shot.\n\nNOTES: World War II Medal of Honor recipient, 96-year old Hershel \u201cWoody\u201d Williams, dropped a ceremonial puck. Forty-six of the 70 living recipients were at the game and are taking part in the Medal of Honor Society Convention in Tampa this week. \u201cThis is a remarkable, truly special occasion,\u201d NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said. \u2026 Tampa Bay owner Jeff Vinik is seeking an outdoor game in Tampa and Bettman said the league continues to study to see if it\u2019s can be done logistically.\n\nUP NEXT:\n\nPenguins: Complete a three-game trip Saturday night at Dallas.\n\nLightning: Close out three-game homestand against Nashville on Saturday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Tampa Bay goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy said \"the wait was well worth it\" after it took a long video review to confirm a victory over Pittsburgh.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mark Didtler"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/23/aptopix_penguins_lightning_hockey_86541_c78-0-4418-2532_s1200x700.jpg?d63382c269a2a8ed832538d9bc0c6c2384ce7e8b", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
