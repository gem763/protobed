Everyone has earned their place here and has the right to try to do the best they can to try and win.\n\n\"On any given day, anyone can be beaten. That's the beauty of sport, there are no certainties. There's always an opportunity for someone to try and bring their best. I think that's the best thing about sport, there are no certainties.\n\n\"It's an exciting week. We've all played well throughout the whole year to try to get here. Now it's about trying to bring our best this week, if we can.\"\n\nBarty will be meeting Bencic, the number seven seed, for the first time in her career after being drawn in the Red Group also containing Naomi Osaka and Petra Kvitova, with the top two in the round robin group phase advancing to Saturday's semi-finals.\n\nWorld No. 2 Karolina Pliskova headlines the Purple Group and starts her tournament against defending champion Elina Svitolina from Ukraine on Monday evening, with Bianca Andreescu taking on Simona Halep later the same day.\n\nThis will be Barty's first appearance in the singles event having previously played in the doubles and she is relishing the opportunity to face off against the elite of the women's game.\n\n\"It's an incredible group of players, I think,\" she said.\n\n\"It's very special being here in singles, having had a bit of a taste it in the doubles the last two years. It was really nice.\n\n\"I think the goal for all singles players is to make the finals at the end of the year, to be playing against the best of the best to test yourself against the best. Really excited to have an opportunity now after a fantastic year to try and finish really well.\"", "description": "No favorites in WTA Finals, says Barty", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9P04T_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
