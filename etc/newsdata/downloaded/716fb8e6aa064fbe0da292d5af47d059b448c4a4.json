This includes iPhone models from 4S to 8 and X.\n\nThe jailbreak uses a new exploit named Checkm8 that exploits vulnerabilities in Apple's Bootrom (secure boot ROM) to grant phone owners full control over their device.\n\nAxi0mX, the security researcher who published the jailbreak today, told ZDNet he'd worked on the jailbreak all this year.\n\nOn Twitter, he described Checkm8 as \"a permanent unpatchable bootrom exploit,\" making the Checkm8 jailbreak one of the most extensive and efficient rooting tools of its kind.\n\nEPIC JAILBREAK: Introducing checkm8 (read \"checkmate\"), a permanent unpatchable bootrom exploit for hundreds of millions of iOS devices.\n\n\n\nMost generations of iPhones and iPads are vulnerable: from iPhone 4S (A5 chip) to iPhone 8 and iPhone X (A11 chip). https://t.co/dQJtXb78sG \u2014 axi0mX (@axi0mX) September 27, 2019\n\nThe researcher's jailbreak sits in a class of its own. Most jailbreaks use vulnerabilities in the iOS operating system and its components to give users control over their devices.\n\nBootrom jailbreaks are very rare. They are the most highly sought after jailbreaks because they are permanent and can't be patched. Fixing any Bootrom vulnerability requires a silicon revision, meaning physical modifications to device chipsets, something that no company can fix without callbacks or mass replacements.\n\nAxi0mX's jailbreak is available on GitHub. The code is marked as a \"beta\" release and it isn't recommended for users without proper technical skills as it could easily brick devices.The jailbreak does not work on Apple's latest two A12 and A13 chipsets.\n\n\"I don't have it working on some older devices yet, like iPhone 4S, but I believe it is possible with a bit more effort,\" Axi0mX told ZDNet earlier today.\n\nDeveloping story.
