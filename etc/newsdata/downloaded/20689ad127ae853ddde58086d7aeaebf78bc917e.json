(AP) - Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shad Khan expects cornerback Jalen Ramsey to play this week.\n\nKhan told a financial news site, The Street, he had a \u201cheart to heart\u201d with the disgruntled defender earlier this week and said Ramsey is scheduled to play against New Orleans (4-1).\n\n\u201cWell, I think, you know, he\u2019s going to be playing this week,\u201d Khan said Thursday during a round of interviews on Wall Street. \u201cSo hopefully you\u2019ll tune into the Saints game. I think it\u2019s something \u2026 you\u2019ve got to balance what\u2019s good for the team with what the individual maybe wishes might be. And I think we\u2019ll be able to kind of formulate it here.\n\n\u201cI met him a couple of days ago, had a heart to heart, and I think we\u2019ll be able to come to what makes sense for all.\u201d\n\nWhat that means exactly remains unclear.\n\nRamsey was slated to practice for a second consecutive day Thursday after missing seven straight because of illness, back tightness and the birth of his second daughter. His back caused him to miss the past two games. He saw a specialist Monday in Houston.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shad Khan expects cornerback Jalen Ramsey to play this week.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/10/jaguars_ramsey_football_35062_c0-118-2829-1767_s1770x1032.jpg?9784e57d7bb6a13105796d8fe7857fd70ee575a3", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
