Owning a strong business and reinvesting the dividends is widely seen as an attractive way of growing your wealth. If you are hoping to live on your dividends, it's important to be more stringent with your investments than the average punter. Regular readers know we like to apply the same approach to each dividend stock, and we hope you'll find our analysis useful.\n\nWhile Fraser and Neave's 2.6% dividend yield is not the highest, we think its lengthy payment history is quite interesting. When buying stocks for their dividends, you should always run through the checks below, to see if the dividend looks sustainable.\n\nClick the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis\n\nSGX:F99 Historical Dividend Yield, October 22nd 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nDividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. Fraser and Neave paid out 41% of its profit as dividends, over the trailing twelve month period. This is a middling range that strikes a nice balance between paying dividends to shareholders, and retaining enough earnings to invest in future growth. Plus, there is room to increase the payout ratio over time.\n\nWe also measure dividends paid against a company's levered free cash flow, to see if enough cash was generated to cover the dividend. Fraser and Neave paid out 102% of its free cash last year. Cash flows can be lumpy, but this dividend was not well covered by cash flow. Fraser and Neave paid out less in dividends than it reported in profits, but unfortunately it didn't generate enough free cash flow to cover the dividend. Cash is king, as they say, and were Fraser and Neave to repeatedly pay dividends that aren't well covered by cashflow, we would consider this a warning sign.\n\nIs Fraser and Neave's Balance Sheet Risky?\n\nAs Fraser and Neave has a meaningful amount of debt, we need to check its balance sheet to see if the company might have debt risks. A rough way to check this is with these two simple ratios: a) net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and b) net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA measures total debt load relative to company earnings (lower = less debt), while net interest cover measures the ability to pay interest on the debt (higher = greater ability to pay interest costs). With net debt of 2.41 times its EBITDA, Fraser and Neave's debt burden is within a normal range for most listed companies.\n\nWe calculated its interest cover by measuring its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), and dividing this by the company's net interest expense. Net interest cover of 9.54 times its interest expense appears reasonable for Fraser and Neave, although we're conscious that even high interest cover doesn't make a company bulletproof.\n\nWe update our data on Fraser and Neave every 24 hours, so you can always get our latest analysis of its financial health, here.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nBefore buying a stock for its income, we want to see if the dividends have been stable in the past, and if the company has a track record of maintaining its dividend. For the purpose of this article, we only scrutinise the last decade of Fraser and Neave's dividend payments. The dividend has been cut by more than 20% on at least one occasion historically. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was S$0.14 in 2009, compared to S$0.045 last year. This works out to a decline of approximately 67% over that time.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Today we'll take a closer look at Fraser and Neave, Limited (SGX:F99) from a dividend investor's perspective.
