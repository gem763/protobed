And there is more to come.\n\n(Picture: Channel 5)\n\nChannel 7 teased: \u2018In 2020, the country\u2019s No. 1 Australian drama will explore stories of love, romance, betrayal and psychological obsession. We see the introduction of a new family which will inject an exciting dynamic to the stellar ensemble cast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018And after a tragedy rocks the town, we will watch the community come together at the most unexpected wedding the Bay has ever seen to celebrate a precious second chance at love.\u2019\n\nIt is traditional due to the commissioned number of episodes for Home and Away to take an annual break so fans who recently heard whispers of a potential axing needn\u2019t worry as there remains nothing to suggest that Channel 7 or Channel 5 are waving goodbye to the popular drama.\n\nMeanwhile, Neighbours won\u2019t be taking a Christmas break for the second year running as a new deal with the UK keeps the soap on air all year round. So if you want your fix of Australian soap over December, Ramsay Street is where it\u2019s at.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Be prepared to lose Summer Bay for a while.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EP-7209-Irene-L.MCGRANGER-is-found-guilty-on-all-charges_HAA-1442_0881-4863_1572428970.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
