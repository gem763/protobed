This is the same room where \u201cWestern Stars,\u201d a movie based on his recent album of the same name, was in postproduction over the summer, with co-director Thom Zimny editing at a nearby dining table as he listened to Springsteen working on the score in the next room. The movie had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in September; it opens in theaters on Oct. 25.\n\nSpringsteen makes his feature directing debut with \u201cWestern Stars,\u201d sharing a credit with Zimny and making official a fact that has been obvious to anyone who\u2019s ever listened closely to his music: Bruce Springsteen \u2014 singer, songwriter, rock star, consummate showman, American icon \u2014 has always been a filmmaker. Whether in the form of widescreen, highly pitched epics or low-budget slices of daily life, Springsteen\u2019s records have been less aural than immersive, unspooling with cinematic scope, drive and pictorial detail. Phil Spector might have built a wall of sound, but Springsteen used sound to build worlds.\n\nHe greets the suggestion that he\u2019s an auteur with one of his frequent self-effacing chuckles. But Springsteen admits that a cinematic point of view came naturally to him. \u201cMovies have always meant a lot to me,\u201d he says in his familiar rasp. \u201cIt\u2019s probably just a part of being a child of the \u201950s and \u201960s and \u201970s, when there was so much great filmmaking.\u201d\n\nHe grew up in a blue-collar, Irish Italian family at a time when the local bijou was still a vital community hub. \u201cThe Strand Theatre in Freehold, N.J., was dead in the center of town,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIt was your classic old, small-town movie theater. Its main attraction was, \u2018Come on in, it\u2019s cool inside.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHe laughs again.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t matter what they were playing, it was air-conditioned. So, on all those dead, small-town summer days, when it would get up into the 90s in Freehold, you\u2019d drift in no matter what was playing, and see what was on the screen.\u201d\n\n\n\nSpringsteen, 70, has long drawn inspiration from movies and actors to tell stories with his songs. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\nSpringsteen\u2019s first album, \u201cGreetings from Asbury Park, N.J.,\u201d introduced him in 1973 as an instinctively visual, character-driven storyteller. The title of his second album that year, \u201cThe Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle\u201d was inspired by a 1959 movie starring the icon of postwar American Westerns, Audie Murphy. The songs evoked everything from \u201cWest Side Story\u201d to the edgy, urban style of young Martin Scorsese.\n\nBut it was 1975\u2019s \u201cBorn to Run\u201d that brought Springsteen\u2019s sensibility into its fullest expression. Structured as a day in the life of young people trying to escape their own dead, small-town summer days, the record plays like a movie of the mind\u2019s eye, with propulsive movement, linear narrative and third-act catharsis.\n\nZimny, who has directed several Springsteen music videos and documentaries and recently won an Emmy for \u201cSpringsteen on Broadway,\u201d recalls listening to \u201cBorn to Run\u201d long before the two worked together, and being particularly affected by the album\u2019s most ambitious track: the street opera \u201cJungleland,\u201d with its fugitive leading man, barefoot love interest and kids flashing guitars \u201cjust like switchblades.\u201d The song \u201copened up a world of possibility for me,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause it just dealt in imagery. \u2018Jungleland\u2019 was the first time I heard a sax solo feel like a Technicolor film.\u201d\n\nIf \u201cBorn to Run\u201d evoked the chrome, concrete and escapist fantasies of the movies Springsteen watched at the Strand, the lexicon of \u201cDarkness on the Edge of Town\u201d was grainier and less mannered, but still harked back to the imaginary worlds of his youth.\n\n\u201cWhen I wrote \u2018Born to Run\u2019 and \u2018Darkness,\u2019 I saw them as B-pictures,\u201d Springsteen says. \u201cIf they worked really well, they were good ones, and the songs I was unhappy with were bad ones.\u201d\n\nHe wanted both records \u201cto have the breadth of cinema,\u201d he says, \u201cwhile at the same time remaining very, very personal for me. Those were the parameters of what I was imagining at that particular moment. I was sort of using the contours and the shape of films and movies, while at the same time trying to find myself in my work. But the film-ness of my songs was never far from my mind.\u201d\n\nAnd it was a self-mythologizing vernacular that his audience immediately understood.\n\n\u201cIt was just how you processed everything,\u201d he continues. \u201cAs a teenager, you were looking for a dramatic life. Where is my dramatic life? As if things weren\u2019t dramatic enough. And you were writing your own script in your head as you walked down the street. It was all just part of living at that time.\u201d\n\n\n\nSpringsteen with his 1948 Chevy pickup truck. After growing up in a small town, his albums often evoke the imaginary worlds of his youth. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\nCinematic influences\n\nJon Landau co-produced \u201cBorn to Run\u201d and \u201cDarkness on the Edge of Town\u201d (as well as several subsequent records) and would talk with Springsteen for hours about music, novels and movies, a conversation that hasn\u2019t ended (Landau has been Springsteen\u2019s manager for 42 years). While they were making \u201cDarkness,\u201d he remembers, Springsteen told him about a movie he\u2019d seen on TV, without catching the title. \u201cHe started to describe the film to me, and I said, \u2018Oh, Bruce, that was \u201cThe Grapes of Wrath.\u201d \u2019 He said, \u2018That\u2019s about the greatest thing I\u2019ve [ever] seen.\u2019 I said, \u2018What did you like about it?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Everything. The look, the intensity, the focus, the artistry, everything.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Well, you know, John Ford directed that.\u2019 And he said, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve heard of him.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat was the point, Landau says, when Springsteen \u201cstarted looking at film in a whole different way. He started to make contact with great American cinema and it just grew and grew and grew.\u201d Eventually, Springsteen formed his own canon of go-to movies, each of which has had an imprint on his records \u2014 Ford\u2019s ambivalent Western epic \u201cThe Searchers,\u201d noir classics \u201cThe Night of the Hunter\u201d and \u201cOut of the Past,\u201d Scorsese\u2019s \u201cMean Streets\u201d and \u201cTaxi Driver.\u201d All share Springsteen\u2019s love for poetic imagery, volatile emotion and deep misgivings about the American myth.\n\n\u201cThe Grapes of Wrath\u201d would become the chief influence on Springsteen\u2019s 1995 record \u201cThe Ghost of Tom Joad,\u201d just as the desolate acoustic mood of \u201cNebraska\u201d had been inspired by \u201cThe Night of the Hunter,\u201d Terrence Malick\u2019s \u201cBadlands\u201d and the 1980s crime drama \u201cTrue Confessions,\u201d with Robert De Niro and Robert Duvall. \u201cThere was something about the stillness of it that affected the way that I wrote at the time,\u201d Springsteen says. \u201cThe violence underneath.\u201d\n\nNearly every Springsteen record has its own musical signature but also its own production and lighting design, character arcs, and shot structure: the high-kicking production numbers of \u201cRosalita\u201d and \u201cOut in the Street.\u201d The gleaming close-ups and jump-cut rhythms of \u201cBorn to Run.\u201d The \u201cEast of Eden\u201d Oedipal rage of \u201cAdam Raised a Cain.\u201d The erotic-thriller charge of \u201cCandy\u2019s Room\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m On Fire.\u201d The lurid neon nightscape of \u201cTunnel of Love.\u201d The aging actors and magic-hour tonal values of \u201cWestern Stars.\u201d Over the course of a nearly 50-year career, both as a solo performer and with the E Street Band, Springsteen\u2019s music has become its own extended cinematic universe, populated by recurring characters, environments and themes: broken heroes. Rattrap towns. Dashed ideals and dogged faith in redemption. And, always, the beckoning highway.\n\nSpringsteen in \"Western Stars,\" which opens in theaters Oct. 25. (Rob DeMartin/Warner Bros.)

RIGHT: Springsteen's \"Western Stars\" evolved from a straightforward documentary into a sweeping montage and introspective portrait. (Rob DeMartin/Warner Bros.)\n\nAlong with the characters he invented, Springsteen has shaped his persona to emulate musical heroes such as Elvis Presley and Woody Guthrie, as well as his favorite actors. On the cover of \u201cDarkness on the Edge of Town\u201d he could be Al Pacino imitating a young De Niro while wearing Marlon Brando\u2019s T-shirt under James Dean\u2019s leather jacket. Springsteen says he was \u201ctremendously\u201d influenced by all those actors as he sought to forge his identity as a performer.\n\n\u201cItalian American actors from the 1970s had a huge impact on me,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you came and saw us onstage in the \u201970s, you saw a very theatrical performance. I was kind of channeling all of those actors from that time, and bringing them onstage with me.\u201d Even the piratical high jinks with Miami Steve Van Zandt and the playful showdowns with Clarence Clemons felt like they sprang directly from the screen: Sharks-vs.-Jets by way of the Bowery Boys.\n\nIt was also at that time \u2014 the first crest of his eventual superstardom \u2014 that Springsteen landed on the covers of both Time and Newsweek, prompting the inevitable calls from Hollywood. He met with Milos Forman, who considered him for \u201cHair.\u201d And he laughs at a classic Kid, I like your moxie! moment with \u201cKing of the Gypsies\u201d producer Dino De Laurentiis. \u201cI was like, 25, and he was behind a big desk smoking a big cigar. It was just that entire scene, played out hilariously.\u201d\n\nEric Roberts eventually got that part. But Springsteen has no regrets. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the confidence at the time,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought, I don\u2019t really deserve to be working in this arena right now, because I hadn\u2019t done the homework. I hadn\u2019t prepared myself. Whereas in music, I\u2019d prepared myself thoroughly.\u201d\n\nIn a rock-and-roll world that prizes authenticity above all else, Springsteen has succeeded at both embodying unaffected sincerity and shrewdly deploying it as a brand: In addition to the unassuming men and women he valorized in his songs, perhaps his most brilliant character is \u201cThe Boss,\u201d a Bruce-adjacent alter ego who, in hundreds of music videos, movie soundtracks and \u201cSopranos\u201d needle-drops, has gone from scruffy boardwalk hustler to bandana-and-biceps teen idol to a multimillionaire in working-class drag.\n\nIf you came and saw us onstage in the \u201970s, you saw a very theatrical performance. I was kind of channeling all of those actors from that time, and bringing them onstage with me. Bruce Springsteen\n\nIn the 1992 single \u201cBetter Days,\u201d Springsteen sang about being \u201ca rich man in a poor man\u2019s shirt.\u201d Today, in addition to the sprawling horse farm in New Jersey, he owns homes in Florida and Los Angeles, but still convincingly radiates man-of-the-people modesty, a contradiction he deflects by being the first person to call it an act. (\u201cI made everything up!\u201d he says at one point. \u201cIt\u2019s a fascinating magic trick.\u201d) Springsteen admits that he continues to find the notion of authenticity elusive, \u201cknowing what a self-creation I was, and to some degree still am. But the strange thing of it all is that if you do it long enough, you start to become the thing that you pretended to be.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the man and the image feel so organically fused that Springsteen has become an emotional instrument in his own right. The latter-day meta-version of Bruce Springsteen, as seen in both \u201cSpringsteen on Broadway\u201d and \u201cWestern Stars,\u201d is simultaneously subject and protagonist, humble singer-songwriter and larger-than-life leading man.\n\nIn both films, the camera often pushes in for a tight shot and stays there, a strategy that Landau notes is by design. \u201cSome of that comes instinctively from our shared love of Sergio Leone, who is the man who proved that you could never be too close,\u201d he explains. But it\u2019s also the result of learning over the years that Springsteen is physically far more expressive than stylized visuals or manipulative edits. Even on huge stadium screens, Landau observes, the close-up has always been king. \u201cThe story of the song is on his face,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you weren\u2019t hearing the lyrics, you\u2019d still have some idea of what he\u2019s saying just from looking at him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe story of the song is on his face,\u201d says Springsteen's longtime manager Jon Landau of the use of close-up shots.

Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\nBeyond the music\n\nAs a movie, \u201cWestern Stars\u201d began with a modest proposition. Instead of touring for the album, Springsteen intended to release a documentary of a performance he and his wife Patti Scialfa recorded over two days with a band and a 30-piece orchestra in their farm\u2019s 100-year-old barn. \u201cI said, \u2018Okay, I\u2019ll shoot the record start to finish,\u2019 \u201d Springsteen recalls, \u201cand that would be my tour.\u201d\n\nBut as he watched the concert footage, he realized that the songs and their lush \u201970s-era arrangements needed more context. One night, while Scialfa watched TV, Springsteen spent a couple of hours writing introductions that became the voice-over script for \u201cWestern Stars.\u201d He and Zimny went to the California desert near Joshua Tree, where Springsteen can be seen roaming amid the brush, reflecting on the American Dream, its disappointments, personal demons (\u201cIf I loved you deeply,\u201d he says at one point, \u201cI would try to hurt you.\u201d) and his cardinal theme: \u201cthe struggle between individual freedom and communal life.\u201d\n\nEventually, \u201cWestern Stars\u201d morphed from a straightforward concert doc to a sweeping montage and introspective portrait, composed of present-day footage, home movies, archival photographs and an achingly beautiful live performance. In the process, Zimny realized that Springsteen\u2019s instincts as an image-maker were just as canny more than 40 years after \u201cJungleland.\u201d The two were in \u201cconstant communication\u201d throughout filming, Zimny says, with Springsteen throwing out ideas far beyond just the music. \u201cIt\u2019s getting texts, it\u2019s getting imagery, it\u2019s getting lines from a song and visual references.\u201d\n\nAt one point, Zimny received a text from Springsteen suggesting a shot of his hand on the steering wheel of a vintage El Camino, then a similar image, this time including Scialfa\u2019s hand. The bookends made the final cut, symbols of freedom and community writ large, but also a man reconciling a lifetime of restlessness and all-consuming ambition to the consolations of domesticity and commitment.\n\nFor Landau, the themes and imagery of \u201cWestern Stars\u201d circle back to the conversations he and Springsteen had about their mutual love for John Ford decades ago. But mostly, he says, it reflects \u201cthe maturation of Bruce\u2019s whole life of learning about film.\u201d More than any previous movie or video, \u201cthis one is him from the get-go, 100 percent,\u201d Landau says. \u201cEvery idea, word, sound, edit and cut.\u201d\n\nSpringsteen describes \u201cWestern Stars\u201d as of a piece with both his 2016 memoir and the Broadway show \u2014 a trilogy that, perhaps unconsciously, was part of his coming to terms with the birthday he just celebrated.\n\n\u201cI was thinking, \u2018How do I sum up my experience to this point?\u2019 \u201d he says. \u201cThe book, the play and this film, they all serve that purpose. It kind of cleanses the palate and it will allow me to move on to whatever we do next.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cwe\u201d in that sentence is the E Street Band and \u201cnext\u201d is recording a new batch of songs he wrote for them earlier this year. Springsteen doesn\u2019t see another movie in his immediate future, unless it\u2019s the four-minute kind he\u2019s been making all along.\n\n\u201cMusic was always enough for me,\u201d he says philosophically. \u201cAnything else that came along was just an adjunct, and an organic and happy accident that came from being a musician, which is what I wanted to be my whole life.\u201d\n\n\n\nLandau says \"Western Stars\" reflects \u201cthe maturation of Bruce\u2019s whole life of learning about film.\u201d (Michael S.
