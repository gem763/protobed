The US comes a distant second, with 4.2%, trailed by South Africa with 3.6% and the UK a mere 2.3%.\n\nSo, having just commissioned a 70-crew trawler from a Spanish shipyard to add to his five-ship fleet, Wallace is understandably concerned how a no-deal Brexit could affect the islands\u2019 future.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not for us to get involved in what the British people decide to do, we can only point out the potential impact to us,\u201d the businessman says. \u201cAnd if there is no deal the impact could be that we would have to pay tariffs: 6% for squid and up to 18% for other fish. That would be of significant consequence.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A dock worker unloads squid from the Falkland Islands in the harbor of Vilagarc\u00eda de Arousa in Spain.

As residents of an overseas territory, Falklanders could not vote in the 2016 Brexit referendum, nor do they vote in UK elections \u2013 unless they happen to be residing in the UK at the time.\n\nSome Falklands officials would like to negotiate a post-Brexit agreement directly with the EU. \u201cIn the event of a no-deal Brexit in which we lost our tariff- and quota-free access, our first port of call would be to seek permission from the UK government to engage directly with the EU to see if it would be possible to come to a bilateral arrangement,\u201d said Richard Hyslop, the Falklands senior policy advisor on Brexit.\n\nThe importance of the EU market for the Falklands cannot be overstated.\n\n\u201cAll our fishery products go through Vigo, in Spain,\u201d says Teslyn Barkman, 31, a sixth-generation Falklander and member of the Falklands legislative assembly who is working with Hyslop to navigate a soft Brexit landing.\n\nMost of the Falkland fishing companies operate joint ventures with Spanish firms, Barkman explains. \u201cIt\u2019s a completely symbiotic business relationship that\u2019s developed over time. About a third of all the calamari that Spain imports comes from us, so there\u2019s a one in three chance that if you\u2019re eating calamari in Spain, it comes from the Falkland islands.\u201d\n\nThe symbiosis is so strong that 6,000 jobs in Spain are tied to the Falklands fishing industry. \u201cSince the UK lost the expertise in the specific vessels that we try to build, Falklands shipping companies have been putting multi-million pound contracts through Vigo,\u201d Barkman says.\n\nAt risk is one of the highest GDP per capita in the world. Falklanders are snuggled up in the 12th slot between Norway and the United Arab Emirates. On average, they earn a yearly $70,800. The United Kingdom, by stark comparison, is ranked 39th, with a GDP per capita of only $35,200, slightly less than half.\n\nFalklands war 30 years on and how it turned Thatcher into a world celebrity Read more\n\nThe Falklands\u2019 fishing boom followed the brief military occupation of the islands by Argentina, which has a long-standing sovereignty claim on the archipelago it calls \u201cLas Malvinas\u201d. The 1982 military incursion claimed the lives of three islanders, 655 Argentinian and 255 British servicemen.\n\nAfter the conflict, the Falklands government began handing out fishing quotas for its surrounding South Atlantic waters after the war, opening the way for today\u2019s squid boom.\n\nNot all Falklanders believe Brexit will be completely negative.\n\nAssembly member Roger Spink has suggested reflagging Falklands fishing vessels as Spanish, dipping into the healthy Falklands budget surplus or seeking financial support from the UK to ride out the storm.\n\nBut his comments to the Falklands news site Penguin News prompted sharp rebukes from Falklands officials and business representatives. His statements \u201cshould not be confused for the government\u2019s view\u201d, Barkman said.\n\n\u201cA no-deal Brexit would not be a great starting point for negotiating a new relationship with the EU.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Although squid is the islands\u2019 main export, sheep farming is still the main job-provider after government. Photograph: Daniel Garc\u00eda/AFP/Getty Images\n\nEU buyers, anticipating the imposition of tariffs, have already started playing shy, said Hyslop. \u201cThe uncertainty surrounding a no-deal is having an effect on meat exports to the EU, with lower prices and slower sales already experienced.\u201d\n\nAgriculture only contributes 1.6% of the GDP today, but sheep farming is still the main job-provider after the islands government: farmers outnumber fishery workers by almost four to one.\n\nThe Brexit effect on agriculture is therefore of tantamount concern to Falkland officials.\n\n\u201cMeat products would likely be subject to tariffs of an average of 42%, rendering the EU market unviable for our products,\u201d said Hyslop.\n\nWallace foresees difficult days ahead. \u201cFishing companies will take a hit on their bottom line immediately on day one.\u201d\n\nAsked if he had a message for 10 Downing Street, Wallace replied: \u201cWe\u2019re sitting here hoping against hope that things will work out in a way that is not negative for us. We\u2019re talking to the UK government, making sure that they know what our situation is. But I don\u2019t suppose that the impact on us is at the top of the UK national agenda.\u201d", "description": "The islands\u2019 remarkable transformation has been powered by fishing \u2013 and locals are anxious at what the future might hold", "authors": ["Uki Go\u00f1i"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d968d3839d78a09fc14d589bc11863e7dac3148/0_50_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4fa5ca971cdea0251ff191a4cee56fc6"}
