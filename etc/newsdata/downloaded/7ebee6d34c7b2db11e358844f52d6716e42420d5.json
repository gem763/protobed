This is because under the Fixed Term Parliament Act, the approval of MPs is required to trigger an early election.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Boris Johnson says the UK will leave the EU on 31 October \"deal or no deal\"\n\nHowever, it's by no means guaranteed that Mr Johnson would gain enough support.\n\nThat's because the election timetable is ultimately in his hands and many MPs would want a cast-iron assurance that a poll will be held while the UK is still a member of the EU.\n\nHowever, assuming enough MPs do support an early election, the prime minister would then recommend the date of the poll to the Queen.\n\nOnce the date is known, Parliament shuts down - or dissolves - 25 working days before election day.\n\nThis is to allow MPs to campaign for re-election.\n\nThis would leave Thursday 10 October as the earliest possible election date.\n\nCould the PM be made to have an election?\n\nIf Mr Johnson wins the vote on whether the Brexit deadline must be extended, he could still be forced to have an early election.\n\nThis could be done through a vote of no confidence, in which MPs would have to decide whether they want the current government to continue.\n\nIf such a vote passes, the government could stay on for 14 days to try to persuade MPs to change their minds.\n\nOther parties might also try to come together to form an alternative government during this period. If this happened, Mr Johnson would be expected to resign and a new prime minister could request a further Brexit delay to prevent a no-deal outcome.\n\nIf nothing is resolved after 14 days, a general election is automatically triggered.\n\nBut the two week wait involved wouldn't leave very much time to organise a general election before 31 October.\n\nCould the prime minister face a legal challenge?\n\nEven though the timing of the election is in the prime minister's hands, it doesn't mean the government would necessarily escape a legal challenge if it chose to hold the vote after 31 October.\n\nDominic Grieve, a Conservative MP and staunch no-deal opponent, has said it would be \"utterly perverse\" to try to take the UK out of the EU during what is known as the period of purdah before an election.\n\nPurdah is the pre-election period in which government departments are restricted from making and communicating policy announcements.\n\nInstead, he argues, the prime minister must ask for an extension to the Brexit date in that event, adding: \"There is a long-established convention that once an election has been called, no government should take anything other than caretaker decisions.\"\n\nBut these are uncharted waters and there may not be an obvious answer.\n\nThat is why both sides are convinced that in this situation the case would inevitably end up in the Supreme Court, with the 12 justices asked to decide the country's fate.", "description": "There is growing speculation an early election could be called.
