The family wishes to thank the entire medical team, as well as the personnel at the CHUM, and will not issue any further comment.\u201d\n\nThe 68-year-old played in 1,126 NHL games from 1971 to 1991, finishing with 1,353 points (560 goals and 793 assists).\n\nLafleur spent the first 14 years with the Canadiens, followed by a three-year retirement. He then played with the New York Rangers for one season and the Quebec Nordiques for two.\n\nMost of those three seasons were spent after he already was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1988.\n\nLafleur became the first player in NHL history to score at least 50 goals and 100 points in six consecutive seasons.\n\nHe holds the record for most points with the Canadiens and helped the club win the Stanley Cup five times.\n\nLafleur, honored one of the NHL\u2019s top 100 players of all time in 2017 by the league, was the sixth Canadiens player to have his number (No. 10) retired.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Montreal Canadiens Hall of Famer Guy Lafleur underwent quadruple bypass heart surgery on Thursday, the NHL club has confirmed.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
