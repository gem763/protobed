Shape Created with Sketch. 34 actors who regret big roles 1/34 Viola Davis \u2013 The Help Viola Davis was nominated for an Oscar for The Help. Yet, the actor deeply regretted playing the maid Aibileen Clark, saying her character\u2019s voice is not heard enough in the final film. \"Have I ever done roles that I've regretted? I have, and The Help is on that list,\" she told The New York Times. \"I want to know what it feels like to work for white people and to bring up children in 1963, I want to hear how you really feel about it. I never heard that in the course of the movie.\u201d Disney 2/34 Megan Fox \u2013 Transformers The Transformers franchise may have grossed billions of dollars at the box-office, but critics have never looked kindly upon the films. Neither has Megan Fox, who told Entertainment Weekly that \u201cpeople are well aware that this is not a movie about acting\u201d. She also previously took aim at director Michael Bay, saying: \u201cHe wants to be like Hitler on his sets, and he is, so he's a nightmare to work for.\u201d Fox later retracted the comment, calling it \u201crighteous anger\u201d that should have not been made public. Paramount 3/34 Katherine Heigl \u2013 Knocked Up Knocked Up remains one of Katherine Heigl\u2019s best-known roles, despite the actor having said she found the whole thing \u201ca little sexist\". \"It paints the women as shrews, as humourless and uptight, and it paints the men as lovable, goofy, fun-loving guys,\u201d she told Vanity Fair. \"It exaggerated the characters, and I had a hard time with it, on some days.\" Universal Pictures 4/34 Idris Elba \u2013 The Wire Few people knew who Idris Elba was before The Wire. Despite the acclaim that came from playing Stringer Bell on the hugely popular crime show, Elba has some regrets. \"We're all idolising Stringer Bell, but who are we really idolising?\" he asked David Lammy while appearing on James O\u2019Brien\u2019s podcast. \"Are we idolising a smart drug dealer or a dumb narcotics dealer? What are we saying here? Is it OK to pump a community full of heroin but because you're smart at it, that makes you cool? That was a problem for me.\" HBO 5/34 Harrison Ford \u2013 Blade Runner There are famously seven cuts of Blade Runner. One of those features Harrison Ford\u2019s character, Rick Deckard, narrating scenes. Another \u2013 the one director Ridley Scott approves of \u2013 is bleaker and does not have Deckard explaining events. Ford does not care for either version. \"I didn't like the movie one way or the other, with or without,\u201d he said in 2017, before the release of Blade Runner 2049. \u201cI played a detective who did not have any detecting to do. In terms of how I related to the material, I found it very difficult. There was stuff that was going on that was really nuts.\" Warner Bros 6/34 Daniel Craig \u2013 James Bond For a time, many people were not sure whether Daniel Craig would return as James Bond for the 25th film in the series. \"I'd rather break this glass and slash my wrists,\u201d he told Time Out of returning to the role. \u201cNo, not at the moment. Not at all. That's fine. I'm over it at the moment. We're done. All I want to do is move on.\" Apparently a big enough pay cheque got him back in the tuxedo. Columbia 7/34 Channing Tatum \u2013 GI Joe \"I'll be honest, I f**king hate that movie,\u201d Channing Tatum said of GI Joe. \u201cI was pushed into doing it. The script wasn\u2019t any good. And I didn\u2019t want to do something that I \u2013 that I was a fan of since I was a kid and watched every morning growing up \u2013 and didn't want to do something that was, one, bad. And two, I just didn\u2019t know if I wanted to be GI Joe.\" Paramount 8/34 Robert Pattinson \u2013 Twilight Most actors who regret taking on roles would wait a few years until publicly bemoaning their experience on set. Not Robert Pattinson. Before the final Twilight film was in cinemas, the actor said of playing the vampire heartthrob Edward Cullen: \"It\u2019s weird kind of representing something you don't particularly like.\" A few weeks later, he added how he would have \u201cmindlessly hated\" the series had he not appeared in it. Summit Entertainment 9/34 Jessica Alba \u2013 Fantastic Four While superhero movies may now be Oscar Best Picture contenders (Black Panther), there was a time when playing a spandex-wearing vigilante was anything but prestigious. Jessica Alba was one of the first people to jump on the superhero boom of the mid-Noughties, playing Invisible Woman in Fantastic Four. The experience, though, left her wanting to quit acting altogether. \"I hated it. I really hated,\" she told Elle. \"I remember when I was dying in Silver Surfer. The director was like, 'It looks too real. It looks too painful. Can you be prettier when you cry? Cry pretty, Jessica'.\" Fox 10/34 Ryan Reynolds \u2013 Green Lantern Ryan Reynolds has never watched Green Lantern all the way through. That has not stopped the actor being highly critical of the superhero role, going as far as having Deadpool \u2013 who he later played \u2013 shoot a fictional version of himself in the head for taking on the role. Ouch. Warner Bros 11/34 Kate Winslet \u2013 Titanic Kate Winslet does not mind Titanic as a film. Her performance as Rose is a completely different matter. \"Every single scene, I'm like 'really, really? You did it like that? Oh my God\u2019. Even my American accent, I can't listen to it. It's awful,\" she told the Telegraph. \"Hopefully it's so much better now. It sounds terribly self-indulgent but actors do tend to be very self-critical. I have a hard time watching any of my performances, but watching Titanic I was just like, 'Oh God, I want to do that again.'\" 20th Century Fox 12/34 Michelle Pheiffer \u2013 Grease II \u201cI hated that film with a vengeance and could not believe how bad it was,\u201d Michelle Pfeiffer said of the sequel to Grease. \"At the time I was young and didn't know any better.\" Thankfully, Pfeiffer's nose for a good script improved rapidly, with her next film being Brian De Palma's cult classic Scarface. Paramount Pictures 13/34 Halle Berry \u2013 Catwoman Halle Berry remains one of the few actors to accept her Golden Raspberry award in person. \"Thank you so much. I never in my life thought I would be up here,\u201d she told the audience, before spoofing her own Oscar acceptance speech and thanking her manager. \"He loves me so much that he convinces me to do projects even when he knows that it is shit.\" Meeeeeow. Warner Bros 14/34 Christopher Plummer \u2013 The Sound of Music The Sound of Music remains one of the most beloved films of all time. Christopher Plummer, though, hated playing Captain von Trapp. \u201cI think the part in The Sound of Music was the toughest,\u201d he told The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cBecause it was so awful and sentimental and gooey. You had to work terribly hard to try and infuse some miniscule bit of humour into it.\u201d 20th Century-Fox 15/34 Ben Affleck \u2013 Daredevil Another big-name actor who regrets taking on a mid-Noughties superhero role. Ben Affleck has remained an ardent Daredveil detractor. \"Daredevil didn't work at all\", the actor told Entertainment Weekly in 2007. \u201cIf I wanted to go viral, I would be less polite. That was before people realised you could make these movies and make them well. There was a cynical sense of \u2018put a red leather outfit on a guy, have him run around, hunt some bad guys, and cash the cheque\u2019.\u201d 20th Century Fox 16/34 Sylvester Stallone \u2013 Stop, or Mom Will Shoot One of Hollywood\u2019s many iconic actors, Sylvester Stallone will always be remembered for both the Rocky and Rambo films. Less so Stop, or Mom Will Shoot, the 1992 buddy-cop comedy that teamed Stallone up with Estelle Getty. Speaking about the film in 2006, he called it \u201cmaybe one of the worst films in the entire solar system, including alien productions we\u2019ve never seen.\u201d Universal Pictures 17/34 Sarah Jessica Parker \u2013 Sex and the City 2 Although Sarah Jessica Parker will forever be best known for playing Carrie Bradshaw on Sex and the City, that does not mean she\u2019s not open to criticising the second film. \"I can see where we fell short,\u201d she told an audience at Vulture festival. \u201cI understand, I actually get it. I will say, I also understand how much frickin\u2019 money it made. I feel like that is forgotten in the discussion.\u201d Warner Bros 18/34 Paul Newman \u2013 The Silver Chalice Paul Newman had high standards. So much so that, before the release of The Silver Chalice, the Oscar-winning actor took out adverts in the trade press urging people to not watch the television broadcast of the film. He later called it \u201cthe worst motion picture produced during the 1950s\". Everett Collection 19/34 Colin Farrell \u2013 Miami Vice Few actors are quite as straight talking as Colin Farrell, who said of the 2006 blockbuster Miami Vice: \"Miami Vice? I didn't like it so much. I thought it was style over substance and I accept a good bit of the responsibility.\u201d Universal Picture 20/34 Brad Pitt \u2013 The Devil\u2019s Own There are many films Brad Pitt could arguably regret making (the awful 1992 flick Cool World comes to mind), but speaking to Newsweek in 1997, the actor decided to criticise The Devil\u2019s Own. He called the film a \"disaster\" and \"the most irresponsible bit of filmmaking, if you can even call it that, that I've ever seen\". Columbia Pictures 21/34 Jim Carrey \u2013 Kick-Ass 2 Following the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, Jim Carrey distanced himself from the violent Kick Ass sequel. \u201cI did Kick Ass a month before Sandy Hook and now in all good conscience I cannot support that level of violence,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cMy apologies\u201d. Universal Pictures 22/34 Zac Efron \u2013 High School Musical Most people know Zac Efron as Troy Bolton from High School Musical. Zac Efron, though, wishes you knew him for something else. \u201cI step back and look at myself and I still want to kick that guy\u2019s ass sometimes,\" he told Men's Fitness. \"He\u2019s done some kind of cool things with some cool people \u2013 he did that one thing that was funny \u2013 but, I mean, he\u2019s still just that f***ing kid from High School Musical.\" Disney 23/34 Shia LaBeouf \u2013 Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull Indiana Jones fans had high expectations for the fourth film. Many were left feeling disappointed by the science-fiction adventure. \"I feel like I dropped the ball on the legacy that people loved and cherished,\" LaBeouf later told the LA Times. \"You get to monkey-swinging and things like that and you can blame it on the writer and you can blame it on Steven [Spielberg]. But the actor's job is to make it come alive and make it work, and I couldn't do it. So that's my fault. Simple.\" Paramount Pictures 24/34 Charlize Theron \u2013 Reindeer Games Charlize Theron may be one of the most acclaimed actors working today, but that does not mean she has not worked on bad films. One of those was Reindeer Games, co-starring Ben Affleck. \u201cReindeer Games. That was a bad, bad, bad movie,\u201d she told Esquire in 2007. \u201cBut even though the movie might suck, I got to work with John Frankenheimer. I wasn\u2019t lying to myself \u2013 that\u2019s why I did it.\u201d Miramax 25/34 Sally Field \u2013 The Amazing Spider-Man The Amazing Spider-Man series, starring Andrew Garfield as the eponymous web-slinger, was supposed to launch a cinematic universe to match the Avengers. There were even rumours of an Aunt May film entering production. Not that the actor who played Aunt May, Sally Field, would have been thrilled by that. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to find a three-dimensional character in it,\u201d she told Howard Stern of playing the character, \u201cand you work it as much as you can, but you can\u2019t put 10 pounds of s**t in a five-pound bag.\u201d Sony 26/34 George Clooney \u2013 Batman & Robin Michael Keaton, Christian Bale, Adam West \u2013 some of Hollywood\u2019s best actors have played the Caped Crusader on screen. However, only one wore a suit with Batnipples: George Clooney. \u201cLet me just say that I\u2019d actually thought I\u2019d destroyed the franchise until somebody else brought it back years later and changed it,\u201d he said of the role. \u201cI thought at the time that this was going to be a very good career move. It wasn\u2019t.\u201d Warner Bros 27/34 Daniel Radcliffe \u2013 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince Daniel Radcliffe was only 11 years old when he was cast as Harry Potter. That has not prevented the actor from looking back at those films with a critical eye. \"I'm just not very good in [The Half Blood Prince],\u201d he told Playboy in 2012. \u201cI hate it. My acting is very one-note and I can see I got complacent and what I was trying to do just didn't come across. My best film is the fifth one [Order of the Phoenix] because I can see a progression.\" Warner Bros 28/34 Josh Brolin \u2013 Jonah Hex Before playing Thanos in Avengers, Josh Brolin portrayed another comic-book character on screen: Jonah Hex. Unlike the Avengers, Hex was not well received by critics \u2013 or Brolin himself. \"I think it deserved that bashing for reasons that those critics will never know,\u201d he told Total Film in 2014. \u201cWe were almost ready to drop [the film] when this kid [director Jimmy Hayward] came up. He was an interesting young guy full of energy and he was obsessed with Jonah Hex. I thought, \u2018This is either a really bad decision or a brilliant decision.' [It was] really bad\u2026 If I'm ever really rich, I'll do that movie again. Seriously.\" Warner Bros 29/34 James Franco \u2013 Your Highness Director David Gordon Green, Danny McBride and James Franco struck gold with their stoner-comedy Pineapple Express. Unfortunately, their attempt to make another laugh-out-loud film, Your Highness, was a mess. \"Your Highness? That movie sucks,\" Franco told GQ. \"You can't get around that.\" Universal Pictures 30/34 Matt Damon \u2013 The Bourne Ultimatum Matt Damon\u2019s original Bourne trilogy won plaudits from critics around the world, with the second instalment featuring on The Independent\u2019s \u201cFilms to watch before you die\u201d list. The actor, though, has spoken unkindly about the third film, The Bourne Ultimatum, saying the original script, written by director Tony Gilroy, was awful. \"It's really the studio's fault for putting themselves in that position,\" Damon told GQ. \"I don't blame Tony for taking a boatload of money and handing in what he handed in. It's just that it was unreadable. This is a career-ender. I mean, I could put this thing up on eBay and it would be game over for that dude. It's terrible. It's really embarrassing. He was having a go, basically, and he took his money and left.\" Universal Pictures 31/34 Arnold Schwarzenegger \u2013 Red Sonja \u201cIt's the worst film I have ever made,\u201d the former Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, said of the fantasy film Red Sonja. \u201cWhen my kids get out of line, they're sent to their rooms and forced to watch Red Sonja 10 times. I never had too much trouble with them.\" MGM/UA Entertainment Company 32/34 Alec Baldwin \u2013 Rock of Ages There are some actors who know they\u2019re making a disaster midway through production. \u201cIt was a complete disaster,\u201d Alec Baldwin told The Wrap when asked about Rock of Ages. \u201cA week in you go, \u2018Oh God, what have I done?'\u201d 33/34 Bill Murray \u2013 Garfield Bill Murray only voiced the beloved cat Garfield because of a misunderstanding: he thought Joel Coen, of the Coen brothers fame, had written the script. In fact, Joel Cohen, whose filmography includes Cheaper by the Dozen, Toy Story, and Monster Mash: The Movie, had. \"I was exhausted, soaked with sweat, and the lines got worse and worse. And I said, 'Okay, you better show me the whole rest of the movie, so we can see what we're dealing with,'\" he told GQ. \"So I sat down and watched the whole thing, and I kept saying, 'Who the hell cut this thing? Who did this? What the f*** was Coen thinking?' And then they explained it to me: it wasn't written by that Joel Coen.\" 20th Century Fox 34/34 Bob Hoskins \u2013 Super Mario Bros Even for video-game adaptations, Super Mario Bros, released in 1993, was a particularly strange film. Asked by The Guardian, \"What is the worst job you've done?\" \"What has been your biggest disappointment?\" and \"If you could edit your past, what would you change?\" the actor had only one answer: \"Super Mario Brothers.\" Buena Vista Pictures Distribution 1/34 Viola Davis \u2013 The Help Viola Davis was nominated for an Oscar for The Help. Yet, the actor deeply regretted playing the maid Aibileen Clark, saying her character\u2019s voice is not heard enough in the final film. \"Have I ever done roles that I've regretted?

Paramount 3/34 Katherine Heigl \u2013 Knocked Up Knocked Up remains one of Katherine Heigl\u2019s best-known roles, despite the actor having said she found the whole thing \u201ca little sexist\". \"It paints the women as shrews, as humourless and uptight, and it paints the men as lovable, goofy, fun-loving guys,\u201d she told Vanity Fair. \"It exaggerated the characters, and I had a hard time with it, on some days.\" Universal Pictures 4/34 Idris Elba \u2013 The Wire Few people knew who Idris Elba was before The Wire.

One of those was Reindeer Games, co-starring Ben Affleck. \u201cReindeer Games. That was a bad, bad, bad movie,\u201d she told Esquire in 2007. \u201cBut even though the movie might suck, I got to work with John Frankenheimer. I wasn\u2019t lying to myself \u2013 that\u2019s why I did it.\u201d Miramax 25/34 Sally Field \u2013 The Amazing Spider-Man The Amazing Spider-Man series, starring Andrew Garfield as the eponymous web-slinger, was supposed to launch a cinematic universe to match the Avengers. There were even rumours of an Aunt May film entering production. Not that the actor who played Aunt May, Sally Field, would have been thrilled by that. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to find a three-dimensional character in it,\u201d she told Howard Stern of playing the character, \u201cand you work it as much as you can, but you can\u2019t put 10 pounds of s**t in a five-pound bag.\u201d Sony 26/34 George Clooney \u2013 Batman & Robin Michael Keaton, Christian Bale, Adam West \u2013 some of Hollywood\u2019s best actors have played the Caped Crusader on screen. However, only one wore a suit with Batnipples: George Clooney. \u201cLet me just say that I\u2019d actually thought I\u2019d destroyed the franchise until somebody else brought it back years later and changed it,\u201d he said of the role. \u201cI thought at the time that this was going to be a very good career move. It wasn\u2019t.\u201d Warner Bros 27/34 Daniel Radcliffe \u2013 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince Daniel Radcliffe was only 11 years old when he was cast as Harry Potter. That has not prevented the actor from looking back at those films with a critical eye. \"I'm just not very good in [The Half Blood Prince],\u201d he told Playboy in 2012. \u201cI hate it. My acting is very one-note and I can see I got complacent and what I was trying to do just didn't come across. My best film is the fifth one [Order of the Phoenix] because I can see a progression.\" Warner Bros 28/34 Josh Brolin \u2013 Jonah Hex Before playing Thanos in Avengers, Josh Brolin portrayed another comic-book character on screen: Jonah Hex. Unlike the Avengers, Hex was not well received by critics \u2013 or Brolin himself. \"I think it deserved that bashing for reasons that those critics will never know,\u201d he told Total Film in 2014. \u201cWe were almost ready to drop [the film] when this kid [director Jimmy Hayward] came up. He was an interesting young guy full of energy and he was obsessed with Jonah Hex. I thought, \u2018This is either a really bad decision or a brilliant decision.' [It was] really bad\u2026 If I'm ever really rich, I'll do that movie again. Seriously.\" Warner Bros 29/34 James Franco \u2013 Your Highness Director David Gordon Green, Danny McBride and James Franco struck gold with their stoner-comedy Pineapple Express. Unfortunately, their attempt to make another laugh-out-loud film, Your Highness, was a mess. \"Your Highness? That movie sucks,\" Franco told GQ. \"You can't get around that.\" Universal Pictures 30/34 Matt Damon \u2013 The Bourne Ultimatum Matt Damon\u2019s original Bourne trilogy won plaudits from critics around the world, with the second instalment featuring on The Independent\u2019s \u201cFilms to watch before you die\u201d list. The actor, though, has spoken unkindly about the third film, The Bourne Ultimatum, saying the original script, written by director Tony Gilroy, was awful. \"It's really the studio's fault for putting themselves in that position,\" Damon told GQ. \"I don't blame Tony for taking a boatload of money and handing in what he handed in. It's just that it was unreadable. This is a career-ender. I mean, I could put this thing up on eBay and it would be game over for that dude. It's terrible. It's really embarrassing. He was having a go, basically, and he took his money and left.\" Universal Pictures 31/34 Arnold Schwarzenegger \u2013 Red Sonja \u201cIt's the worst film I have ever made,\u201d the former Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, said of the fantasy film Red Sonja. \u201cWhen my kids get out of line, they're sent to their rooms and forced to watch Red Sonja 10 times. I never had too much trouble with them.\" MGM/UA Entertainment Company 32/34 Alec Baldwin \u2013 Rock of Ages There are some actors who know they\u2019re making a disaster midway through production. \u201cIt was a complete disaster,\u201d Alec Baldwin told The Wrap when asked about Rock of Ages. \u201cA week in you go, \u2018Oh God, what have I done?'\u201d 33/34 Bill Murray \u2013 Garfield Bill Murray only voiced the beloved cat Garfield because of a misunderstanding: he thought Joel Coen, of the Coen brothers fame, had written the script. In fact, Joel Cohen, whose filmography includes Cheaper by the Dozen, Toy Story, and Monster Mash: The Movie, had. \"I was exhausted, soaked with sweat, and the lines got worse and worse. And I said, 'Okay, you better show me the whole rest of the movie, so we can see what we're dealing with,'\" he told GQ. \"So I sat down and watched the whole thing, and I kept saying, 'Who the hell cut this thing? Who did this? What the f*** was Coen thinking?' And then they explained it to me: it wasn't written by that Joel Coen.\" 20th Century Fox 34/34 Bob Hoskins \u2013 Super Mario Bros Even for video-game adaptations, Super Mario Bros, released in 1993, was a particularly strange film. Asked by The Guardian, \"What is the worst job you've done?\" \"What has been your biggest disappointment?\" and \"If you could edit your past, what would you change?\" the actor had only one answer: \"Super Mario Brothers.\" Buena Vista Pictures Distribution\n\nFanning responded to the criticism on an Instagram story.\n\n\u201cJust to clarify.
