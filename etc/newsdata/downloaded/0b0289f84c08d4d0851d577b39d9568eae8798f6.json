Before the impeachment proceedings and the passage of the resolution, Trump was only planning to release the transcript.\n\nOne of the most pressing questions of the hectic Tuesday involved why Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell chose to counter his block-everything legacy and fast-track the resolution. (McConnell chose to \u201chotline\u201d the motion, meaning he bypassed normal Senate procedures to move Schumer\u2019s request to a vote without floor debate.) Theories abound: Maybe the whistle-blower complaint isn\u2019t all that bad politically, and only personally embarrassing to the president? Conversely, maybe it\u2019s so bad that realpolitik McConnell is prepared for a Pence presidency? It certainly doesn\u2019t jive with the expected move from the Senate Majority Leader \u2014 to demand the transcript Trump promised and attempt to keep the whistle-blower\u2019s report private.\n\nWhatever McConnell\u2019s intentions are, the whistle-blower situation will continue to develop this week parallel to the impeachment inquiry: On Wednesday, the House will vote on a similar non-binding resolution demanding that the Trump administration release the report to Congress and that they \u201ccease their public efforts to discredit the whistle-blower.\u201d The whistle-blower him-or-herself is on board, requesting on Tuesday to speak with the House and Senate Intelligence committees.\n\nThis post has been updated.", "description": "Shortly before Nancy Pelosi announced the opening of a formal impeachment inquiry against President Trump, Chuck Schumer passed a unanimous, non-binding resolution demanding the whistle-blower complaint be turned over to intelligence committees.", "authors": ["Matt Stieb"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/24/schumer_impeachment.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
