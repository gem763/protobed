It\u2019s a different format.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not going to stress me out too much. We\u2019ll hit the practice court tomorrow and come back on Thursday, try to play for a spot in the semis.\u201d\n\nBarty and Bertens were joined on one win apiece at the end of the second round of matches in the Red Group by Bencic after the Swiss beat Petra Kvitova 6-3 1-6 6-4, which leaves the Czech winless in her opening two matches.\n\nAfter a solid start by both players, Kvitova found the net with a volley from close range to drop her serve in the seventh game and, two games later, surrendered the opener when she hit a double fault on set point.\n\nKvitova was relentless in the second set as consistent serving and the strength of her returns left Bencic increasingly frustrated, with the Swiss slamming her racket into the ground on the way to a comprehensive loss.\n\nBut the 22-year-old showed her resilience as she steadied herself in the final set, claiming the vital break in the penultimate game before closing out the win.", "description": "Ashleigh Barty surrendered a one-set lead to crash to a 3-6 6-3 6-4 loss at the hands of late replacement Kiki Bertens at the WTA Finals on Tuesday as the world number one's prospects of advancing to the semi-finals suffered a blow.", "authors": ["Michael Church", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446225662&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S1CU-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
