Because later in that news conference he also said he does want Ukraine to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden and now he's saying hey, maybe China ought to as well.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cpoint\u201d for Henry is that the president is \u201cnot hiding that he wants an investigation\u201d into the Bidens. \u201cThe question is going to be, was it tied to U.S. aid to Ukraine, could they prove that?\u201d he said. \u201cSo far there has been no evidence of that,\u201d he added, even though it could be argued the proof is in the summary of the call released by Trump\u2019s White House.\n\n\u201cThe president is going to have to make sure the facts are on his side though,\u201d Henry added. \u201cHe has been honest and transparent publicly about how he wants this investigated and by the way it's put a spotlight on Joe and Hunter Biden in a way that the way the Democrats didn't want.\u201d\n\nHenry\u2019s remarks sounded a lot like an effort to get back in Trump\u2019s good graces after this past Sunday, when he was attacked by the president directly for simply asking conservative commentator Mark Levin on Fox & Friends Weekend for his thoughts on the scandal.\n\n\u201cThe president of the United States, I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s illegal\u2014are you OK with a president asking his counterpart\u2014this is a simple yes or no\u2014to dig up dirt on former vice president Joe Biden and his son?\u201d Henry asked Levin. \u201cAre you OK with that?\u201d\n\nThe question caused Levin to explode at Henry, shouting back, \u201cYour question is not honest!\u201d\n\nThat line drew personal praise from Trump, who tweeted out a link to the segment with the words, \u201cSo great, Mark!\u201d Trump then proceeded to retweet nearly two dozen tweets attacking Henry, including one that called him a \u201clying shit head\u201d and another of a parody bot account that praised Levin for shutting down \u201cEd Henry and the Pro Shark Media.\u201d", "description": "The president retweeted nearly two dozen attacks on Ed Henry over the weekend, including one that labeled him a \u201clying shit head.\u201d", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1436,w_2552,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570208430/EH_ilebgc", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
