Maven, which has raised about $42 million, offers tools for companies to support working parents, such as online doctor visits and a concierge who can help women and families make appointments.\n\nRyder founded Maven in 2014 after working as a journalist for The Economist and The New Yorker. In between her journalism career and starting Maven, she was an early-stage investor at Index Ventures.\n\nRyder last week discussed her time working as a journalist and how it influences her decisions as the CEO at Maven on the podcast \"A Healthy Dose.\" The podcast, led by the healthcare investors Steve Kraus and Trevor Price, focuses on discussions with professionals in US healthcare. Price's firm Oxeon Partners has helped Maven find executives, according to its website.\n\nWhen asked if journalism helped her business career, Ryder responded: \"100%.\"\n\nAs Kraus and Price point out in the episode, Ryder managed to score funding from two venture-capital giants, Sequoia and Oak HC/FT, which led a Series B funding round of $27 million last year. The company was valued at $87 million in that round, according to PitchBook. Maven said the PitchBook valuation wasn't accurate.\n\nNever miss out on healthcare news.

In the case of Maven, Ryder must constantly provide answers to questions outside her expertise, whether that's in the legal or medical domain.\n\n\"I have a very smart group of executives at Maven advising me,\" she said.\n\nBeing a storyteller helps to sell your product\n\nRyder also said that being a storyteller is an important skill for a CEO. A company could have an amazing product, but if it can't tell the story of the product, the company falls short, she said.\n\n\"As a startup founder, storytelling is so important,\" Ryder said. \" Whether you're raising money, selling a business, selling a product, hiring someone, it's just all storytelling.\"\n\nRead more: Meet the 8 companies changing how doctors get paid and building the future of medicine\n\nThe storytelling aspect is a skill that's also important when it comes to crafting a pitch deck to use with investors, she said.\n\nIn the pitch deck, it's important for a company to be clear and concise. Ryder said each slide should have a headline that clearly says what the slide is about. Someone should be able to read the headlines of a fundraising deck alone and understand what the presentation is about, she said.\n\n\"A simple story is the most powerful story,\" she said.\n\nRyder also said storytelling is a good skill to have at conferences, where buyers often hear pitch after pitch, which can be monotonous. Having a story can make the company stand out to investors and buyers, she said.", "description": "Kate Ryder says that to sell a product, you have to tell a story.
