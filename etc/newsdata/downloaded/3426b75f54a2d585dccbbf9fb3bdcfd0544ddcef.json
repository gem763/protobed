That time of the year is almost here again, and as the season approaches, there is a possible saviour for the Delhites - Tesla electric cars and their Bioweapon Defense Mode!\n\nWhen most of the residents of the Delhi-NCR region find it extremely hard to step out of their air-conditioned enclosures, Tesla cars can prove to be the ideal mode of commuting in the region. The Bioweapon Defense Mode mentioned above is the key here, an extremely large HEPA filter installed in the Tesla Model X and Model S that keeps the in-cabin air clean.\n\nMake no mistake, these HEPA filters are not the ordinary air filters found in cars. To stress on this, Tesla claims that the Bioweapon Defense Mode is \u201c100 times more effective than premium automotive filters, removing at least 99.97% of fine particulate matter and gaseous pollutants, as well as bacteria, viruses, pollen, and mold spores.\u201d\n\nTesla Model X (Image: Tesla)\n\nThe California saviour\n\nRecent incidents have backed the efficiency of these filters, as some California residents took to Twitter to share their experiences during the California wildfires. For those unaware, the ongoing Saddleridge Fire in California, currently the largest in the state, has burned more than 7,500 acres. Authorities in the region have strictly advised residents to stay protected from heavy smoke and hazardous air conditions.\n\nDon't Miss 336 SHARES 557 SHARES 1.5 K SHARES 123 SHARES 175 SHARES\n\nAmidst this, owners of Tesla cars have shared how their cars have saved them from this heavy smoke, with some even going on to call Tesla a \u201clifesaver\u201d. \u201cThank you Elon Musk and Tesla for helping us with breathing issues during the fires today in Los Angeles due to bad air quality. Bioweapon defense mode is a life saver,\u201d one Tesla owner from the region wrote.\n\nThank you @elonmusk and @Tesla for helping us with breathing issues during the fires today in Los Angeles due to bad air quality.

The Tesla user mentioned that the Bioweapon Defense Mode kept the air quality inside the cabin at optimum levels even when the road they were travelling on was practically surrounded by fires. In addition to the air filtration, the user even complemented the electric car\u2019s AutoPilot system, reporting that it followed lane lines without any difficulties even during the disastrous conditions on the road.\n\nShow-off Tesla\n\nTesla demonstrated the capabilities of Bioweapon Defense Mode in a test where a Model X was placed inside a bubble contaminated with extreme levels of pollution - 1,000 \u00b5g/m3 of PM2.5. The \u201cgood\u201d air quality index limit as per EPA is 12 \u00b5g/m3. Within 2 minutes, the electric SUV cleaned all the air inside the cabin of the car, after which it started purifying the air around it as well, by as much as 40%.\n\nTesla testing out the HEPA filters and Bioweapon Defense mode on the Model X (Image: Tesla)\n\nResults of the tests as claimed by Tesla (Image: Tesla)\n\nPerfect for Delhi?\n\nTo think of it, such air filtration systems are exactly what the people of Delhi-NCR need. Delhi was recently ranked as one of the top most polluted cities in the world. The level of particulate matter in the Delhi air makes it inevitable for anyone living in the region to inhale those pollutants. Guess where most of these pollutants are found? On the roads of Delhi, of course!\n\nSo as and when such a car with a system in place to provide clean air despite the enormous levels of pollution outside is available, it can be argued that it is the best way to avoid the harmful effects of air pollution while on the move.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, being electric, these cars are clean themselves, so no adding to the pollution during your travels either!", "description": "Tesla's Bioweapon Defense Mode is saving lives in California as the wildfires in the region rage on. As the air filtration system is top notch with utmost efficiency in comparison with its likes, here is how Tesla's unique feature can help the people of Delhi too.", "authors": ["Sarthak Dogra"], "top_image": "https://media.indiatimes.in/media/facebook/2019/Oct/tesla_bio_hazard_test_1571293766_800x420.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
