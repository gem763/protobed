Throw in the almost universally acknowledged continued levels of heightened uncertainty on the political front ... and it is actually pretty shocking that a comment that a rate cut is 'quite plausible' has caused such a response.\"\n\nNO WAIT AND SEE\n\nSimply waiting to see what happened with Brexit risked leading to inappropriate monetary policy, and the cost of reversing a rate cut if the outlook brightened would be low, Saunders added at the event hosted by the Barnsley and Rotherham Chamber of Commerce and Institute of Chartered Accountants.\n\n\"In general, I would prefer to be nimble... accepting that it may be necessary to change course if the outlook changes significantly,\" he said.\n\nSaunders still agreed with recent BoE guidance that a limited and gradual increase in interest rates would be needed over the medium term, if Brexit uncertainty reduced significantly and global growth perked up a bit.\n\nIn the event of a no-deal Brexit, Saunders repeated the BoE position that all policy options would be open.\n\nEarlier this month, BoE Governor Mark Carney estimated in a worst-case, chaotic scenario that a no-deal Brexit could reduce the size of the economy by 5.5%. The Paris-based OECD has predicted a 2% hit in the case of a more managed no-deal Brexit.\n\nSaunders was clear that a no-deal Brexit - advocated by some Brexit supporters as a way to resolve the uncertainty facing businesses - was not a good solution. \"This would probably immediately leave some firms unprofitable. Others might face longer-term questions about their viability, or whether they would be better off relocating.\"", "description": "UK rate cut 'plausible' if Brexit uncertainty persists - BoE's Saunders", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8Q0RG_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
