Staging a game in Russia remains a possibility in the coming years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a game-changer for us,\u201d NHL executive vice president of international and media strategy David Proper said Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re more than dipping our toe into the market.\u201d\n\nThe NHL\u2019s previous agreement called for 15 games a week to be broadcast in Russia. That gave a window into the league and its Russian stars like Alex Ovechkin, Evgeny Malkin, Nikita Kucherov and Vladimir Tarasenko, but the long-term goal is to create not just more fans but another generation of players.\n\nCiting agreements in other countries with established pro leagues, Proper said the NHL is not trying to cut into the KHL\u2019s market but rather help the Russian-based league with more exposure.\n\n\u201cIf things go really well, it rises all boats because people become hockey fans,\u201d Proper said. \u201cFor the most part they\u2019re not on at the same times as KHL games, so this gives us the opportunity to show how great Russian players are and maybe hopefully that in some way helps just the overall growth of hockey in the market.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Hockey Writer Stephen Whyno on Twitter at https://twitter.com/SWhyno\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The NHL is expanding its reach into Russia through a new streaming agreement that's set to make every regular-season and playoff game available in the country.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Stephen Whyno"], "top_image": ""}
