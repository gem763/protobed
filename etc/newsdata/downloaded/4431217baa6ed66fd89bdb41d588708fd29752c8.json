That evidence has also been supported by further studies in mice and worms, the scientists said.\n\nIn this study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal, Castillo-Quan's team gave fruit flies doses of the three drugs separately and in combination.\n\nEach drug individually extended lifespan by an average of 11%, they found, and pairing two drugs extended lifespan by around 30%. But when all three were combined, the fruit flies lived 48% longer than flies that did not get the treatment.\n\n\"We found it was quite remarkable that this drug combination enabled them to live 48% longer,\" said Castillo-Quan, who now works at Harvard Medical School in the United States.\n\nThe researchers said they plan to conduct more studies to try to decipher exactly how the drugs work in combination with each other. They hope to move on to experiments in more complex animals, such as mice, to gauge the effects on the entire body before eventually progressing to human trials.\n\n\u00a9 (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2019.", "description": "Scientists who gave fruit flies a triple drug combination treatment and found that it extended their lives by almost 50% say their work offers clues on how to fight aging in people.
