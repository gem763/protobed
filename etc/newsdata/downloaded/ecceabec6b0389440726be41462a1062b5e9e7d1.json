For a private company to go and attempt to trademark a word that does not belong to them but call it a logo is quite frankly despicable.\"", "description": "A bid to trademark the title of its in-flight magazine \"Kia Ora\" has sparked backlash from Maori groups.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/BD65/production/_108758484_gettyimages-1074831708-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
