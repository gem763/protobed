What\u2019s happening in Syria is due to Trump taking an unstaffed call with Erdogan & caving to his Turkish business allies. https://t.co/iOxHPXzvOI \u2014 Joyce Alene (@JoyceWhiteVance) October 13, 2019\n\n\"We find these reports to be extremely troubling, reflecting\n\nthe overall destabilization of northeast Syria since the\n\ncommencement of hostilities on Tuesday,\" the spokesman said in\n\nan email.\n\nKhalaf had been returning from a meeting in Hasaka at the\n\ntime of the attack in which her driver and an aide were also\n\nkilled, said Hussein Omar, the Future Syria Party's coordinator\n\nin Europe. Party officials including Khalaf have had contacts\n\nwith U.S. officials since it was founded in 2018, he said.\n\nAsked about the accusation that Turkey-backed groups had\n\nkilled Khalaf, the spokesman for the Turkey-backed National\n\nArmy, which groups Syrian rebel factions, on Saturday said they\n\nhad not made it as far as that area.\n\n\"We condemn in the strongest of terms any mistreatment and\n\nextrajudicial execution of civilians or prisoners, and are\n\nlooking further into these circumstances,\" the U.S. State\n\nDepartment spokesman said.\n\nAnkara launched the cross-border assault against the YPG\n\nmilitia on Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew\n\nsome U.S. troops from the border region, opening of the biggest\n\nnew fronts in years in an eight-year old civil war that has\n\ndrawn in global powers.\n\nTurkey says the YPG is a terrorist group aligned with\n\nKurdish militants in Turkey and that it reserves the right to\n\nprotect its borders.\n\nTurkey's incursion has raised international alarm over its\n\nmass displacement of civilians and the possibility of Islamic\n\nState militants escaping from Kurdish prisons. The Kurdish-led\n\nforces have been key allies for the United States in eliminating\n\nthe jihadist group from northern Syria.\n\nTrump's administration has threatened Turkey with economic\n\nsanctions over potential targeting of civilians and has warned\n\nit not to allow any Islamic State militants to escape.\n\nSenior State Department official last week said Ankara\n\nshould avoid any \"disproportionate and inhumane\" actions in\n\nnortheast Syria, including ethnic cleansing and firing at\n\ncivilians.\n\n(Reporting by Humeyra Pamuk; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle and\n\nLisa Shumaker)", "description": "The United States is looking into reports that a Kurdish politician and captured Kurdish fighters were killed in northeastern Syria amid Turkey's offensive, a State Department spokesman told Reuters on Sunday, adding that Washington found the reports disturbing.
