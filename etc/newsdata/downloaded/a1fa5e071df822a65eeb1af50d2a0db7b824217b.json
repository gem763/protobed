Defensively England have looked much more vulnerable since the formation switch, having conceded three goals in a 5-3 win at home to Kosovo last month.\n\nCzech Republic had 17 shots in Prague, the most England have faced in a qualifying match since March 2013.\n\nSouthgate can either still try to fit Kane, Sancho, Sterling and Mount \u2014 not to mention Marcus Rashford and Callum Hudson-Odoi \u2014 into the same team or sacrifice some of those players to bring solidity to England\u2019s formation once more.\n\nIf the manager feels he does not have the right players, especially in midfield, to deploy a 4-3-3 or 3-4-3 shape, bringing in Liverpool Trent Alexander-Arnold and Leicester City\u2019s Ben Chilwell as wing backs looks a viable option.\n\nAlexander-Arnold had more assists (12) than any defender in a Premier League season in 2018/19 and only Manchester City\u2019s Belgium midfielder Kevin De Bruyne has created more chances in the current campaign, while Chilwell has played a crucial role in Leicester City\u2019s impressive start to the season.\n\nThis change would allow Southgate to deploy three centre-backs again, while giving England an extra attacking dimension.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always maintained that there\u2019s a lot of work to be done to be a really top team,\u201d he said after Friday\u2019s loss.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t look any more solid, and we were poor at using the ball in the first half.\n\n\u201cWe collectively have to accept the result but, of course, as the manager then I have got to accept that as well.\u201d\n\nThe performance against Bulgaria, with a system that ensures England do not look vulnerable at the back while retaining their attacking threat, is now as important as the result.\n\nEngland remain on the brink of qualification for Euro 2020 but, with just two competitive games left after Monday\u2019s clash, time is running out for Southgate to find a tactical formula that could bring success at next year\u2019s tournament.", "description": "England's first tournament qualifying defeat in 10 years on Friday was not a cause for panic but the uncertainty over their best formation has given manager Gareth Southgate plenty to ponder ahead of Monday's Euro 2020 qualifier in Bulgaria.", "authors": ["Peter Hall", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191012&t=2&i=1440075071&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9B0FO", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
