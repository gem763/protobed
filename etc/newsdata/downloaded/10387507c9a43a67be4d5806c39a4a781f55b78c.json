But, it added, \u201cThe company is unable to predict if or when the MoviePass service will continue.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Helios and Matheson said its board has commenced a review of strategic and financial options, including a potential sale of the New York-based company in its entirety or a business reorganization.\n\nEven with MoviePass\u2019 evident demise, the service has spurred theater chains including AMC Theatres, Regal Entertainment and Cinemark to launch their own rival subscription plans. Last month, AMC said its Stubs A-List program, which lets subscribers see three movies weekly for $19.95 a month, had hit 900,000 subscribers.\n\nFor more than a year, MoviePass has had trouble keeping the lights on. Just before the July 4 holiday, it said it was suspending service for several weeks in order to fix technical issues and finish work on a new version of its app. In August, it claimed to have restored service to \u201ca substantial number of our current subscribers.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, also last month, MoviePass confirmed that a security issue may have left customers records exposed online, including credit card info.\n\nIn August 2018, MoviePass eliminated the popular one-movie-per-day plan, priced at $9.95 per month \u2014 an offer that proved to be economically unsustainable. It replaced that with a new $9.95 plan letting subscribers see just three movies each month, but that evidently was not a viable path to profitability either. This year, it rolled out a refashioned \u201cunlimited\u201d option, for $14.95 per month, to again allow customers to see one movie daily but warning that movie choices would be restricted based on \u201csystem-wide capacity.\u201d\n\nFor full-year 2018, Helios and Matheson\u2019s net loss more than doubled, to $329.3 million, on revenue of $232.3 million, according to its most recent financial filing. The company acquired control of MoviePass in 2017. Helios and Matheson\u2019s shares were delisted from the Nasdaq on Feb. 12, 2019, after its stock price failed to meet the exchange\u2019s $1-per-share minimum requirement, and have been available in over-the-counter trading.\n\nHelios and Matheson is being investigated by the New York Attorney General, which is looking into whether the company misled investors. The company also is the target of a class-action lawsuit by MoviePass subscribers claiming the change in the \u201cunlimited\u201d plan was a deceptive \u201cbait-and-switch\u201d tactic.\n\nSign up for Variety\u2019s Newsletter.
