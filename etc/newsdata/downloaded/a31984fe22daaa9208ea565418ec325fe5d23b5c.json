The popular television actress has admitted to paying $15,000 in an effort to boost her eldest daughter's SAT score.\n\nHuffman walked into the federal courthouse in Boston while holding hands with her husband, William H. Macy. Macy has not been charged in the scandal.\n\nProsecutors have recommended that Huffman, 56, spends one month in prison. Her lawyers said she should serve a year of probation.\n\nIn 2017, prosecutors said Huffman paid the $15,000 to a foundation by William Singer, who allegedly arranged for a particular proctor to ensure her daughter scored well on the SAT. Her daughter received a score of 1420, approximately 400 points over her PSAT score from the year prior, according to the federal indictment.\n\nHuffman pleaded guilty to a single count of conspiracy and fraud in May.\n\nThis is a breaking story. It will be updated.\n\nActress Felicity Huffman arrives at the federal courthouse with her husband William H.
