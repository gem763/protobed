REUTERS/Aly Song/Files\n\nFRANKFURT (Reuters) - Ionity, the European electric vehicle charging joint venture of Volkswagen, BMW, Daimler and Ford, said on Monday that South Korea\u2019s Hyundai Motor had joined as a shareholder.\n\nIonity aims to install 400 high-speed charging stations across Europe by the end of next year in a bid to combat concerns about the range of electric vehicles, which is still considered a key factor limiting demand.\n\nSo far, the venture has installed 140 stations in 14 European countries, while a further 50 are under construction.\n\n\u201cThe participation of new investors in Ionity is a clear signal of trust indicating that the work of our young company is already bearing fruit,\u201d Chief Executive Michael Hajesch said in a statement.\n\nNo financial details were disclosed about Hyundai Motor\u2019s involvement.\n\nThe announcement comes days before the Frankfurt Auto Show IAA, where sustainable driving and electric cars will take centre stage. Volkswagen will display its ID 3 electric vehicle, Porsche its Taycan electric sports car, and Mercedes-Benz its fully electric van.\n\nCarmakers are pouring much of their cash into developing electric vehicles, while energy providers hesitate to take on responsibility for the rollout, as long as electric car sales remain too low to provide a profitable customer base.", "description": "Ionity, the European electric vehicle charging joint venture of Volkswagen, BMW, Daimler and Ford, said on Monday that South Korea's Hyundai Motor had joined as a shareholder.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427887190&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF880RQ", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
