The prime minister achieved this by capturing scores more seats in Ontario, while his chief rival, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, ran up the score in the less-populous west. The outcome reflects voter disenchantment with Canada's two major parties, reports Alex and Lauren, who were in Montreal and Regina, Sask., respectively, as results rolled in.\n\n\u201cTonight, we have put Trudeau on notice,\u201d Scheer said in a speech Monday. \u201cHis leadership is damaged and his government will end soon. When that time comes the Conservatives will be ready and we will win.\u201d (In what may be a sign of things to come, Trudeau started his speech just minutes after Scheer, forcing TV networks to cut away.)\n\nA weakened leader: With a minority government \u2014 which tend to last about two years \u2014 Trudeau will need to cut deals with other parties if he wants to push through priorities. Still, the Liberal leader may find it relatively easy to govern because the party holds enough seats that they can win any vote in the House of Commons with support from just one of the three main opposition parties.\n\nThe U.S.-Mexico-Canada-Agreement should be one of the easier tasks, as Liberals and Conservatives have both endorsed the trade pact. (President Donald Trump tweeted his congratulations to Trudeau on \u201cwonderful and hard fought victory.\u201c) It remains to be seen whether Trudeau is pushed to the left on climate action, after getting pummeled on the campaign trail for purchasing the Trans Mountain Pipeline.\n\nThe results in Western Canada showcase a country deeply divided. A progressive group of parties that favor carbon pricing are resolutely dominant, and the oil-producing conservative West mostly powerless at the federal level. Trudeau did make an overture to the region, however, stating: \u201cKnow that you are an essential part of our great country. Let us all work hard to bring our great country together.\u201d\n\nSurviving controversy: First was Trudeau\u2019s trip to India marred by an embarrassing security gaffe and a passion for traditional outfits that drew mockery. Second was a scandal in which he and his office pressed the country\u2019s attorney general to drop corruption charges on a Montreal engineering company. Then the TIME Magazine bombshell in September showing him in brownface two decades ago, followed by more photos and videos of Trudeau in racist makeup.\n\nBATTLEGROUND BREAKDOWN: The Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois leader Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet helped the party triple its seats compared with 2015, from 10 to more than 30. The strong showing mostly cut into NDP territory in the province, as well as some Liberal seats, such as in Lac Saint-Jean where the son of former Bloc leader Gilles Duceppe won.\n\nBlanchet on Monday night made clear he will fight any oil infrastructure through Quebec, although the separatist party leader said he would help Trudeau\u2019s government when it suits the province. The party can cooperate with \u201cany government\u201d; if what is proposed is good for Quebec, \u201cyou can count on us,\u201d but if harms the province, \u201cthe Bloc will stand up and block it,\u201d he said \u2014 to loud applause.\n\nA death knell for populism? Not according to Maxime Bernier, the leader of the People's Party of Canada. Despite losing his own seat in Beauce, Quebec \u2014 and capturing no others across the country \u2014 Bernier said the PPC is just getting started. \u201cHundreds of thousands of Canadians supported the People\u2019s Party today,\u201d he said in a concession speech. \u201cWe will continue to grow in the coming months and years.\u201d\n\nBernier, since forming the PPC last year after breaking from Conservatives, had been denounced as a xenophobe (and doomed) after making Trump-like vows such as building a fence along Canada\u2019s southern border. Get a refresher on his campaign from Richard Warnica\u2019s profile in POLITICO Magazine.\n\nThe fate of Trudeau\u2019s Cabinet: Two former ministers, who were booted from the Liberal party after standing up to Trudeau over his handling over the SNC-Lavalin affair, had opposite fates on Monday. Jody Wilson-Raybould, the former attorney general running as an independent, prevailed in Vancouver-Granville. But Jane Philpott failed to beat her Liberal challenger in the GTA riding of Markham-Stouffville.\n\nCatherine McKenna, the environment minister who ushered in the carbon tax, came out on top in Ottawa Centre, overcoming a potential NDP takeover.\n\nThe lone Liberal in Saskatchewan, Ralph Goodale, was booted after 26 years representing Regina-Wascana. That means he is also giving up his role as Canada\u2019s minister of public safety and emergency preparedness.\n\nNDP holds Vancouver Island: The Greens were hoping for a breakthrough, but it largely failed to materialize. Party leader Elizabeth May and one other candidate prevailed in British Columbia. On the Atlantic coast, the party also picked off Fredericton, New Brunswick from the Liberals.\n\nMay did however promise to try and hold other parties\u2019 feet to the fire when it came to the party\u2019s climate priorities: \u201cThere will be crispy toes.\u201d\n\nTHE NEW CLIMATE SCIENCE BEING TESTED IN COURT: Climate campaigners including cities, states and ordinary citizens are wielding a new field of research against fossil fuel companies to put them on the hook for billions of dollars in damages: attribution science.\n\nDeveloped by Richard Heede and a number of collaborators, the geographer by training \u2014 after a decade of work \u2014 tabulated in 2013 that just 90 companies around the world had contributed two-thirds of all greenhouse gas emissions. This shifted the conversation: If blame can be attributed to corporations, suing them could unleash financial resources to fund new technologies and better prepare communities for more severe natural disasters, POLITICO\u2019s Zack Colman reports for The Agenda.\n\nSo far, 13 state and local governments have filed lawsuits against oil and gas companies like Exxon Mobil, BP and ConocoPhillips. They have been targeted by cities like New York, Baltimore, Oakland, San Francisco and Richmond. The lawsuits aren\u2019t all the same: most argue that fossil fuel companies marketed a product they knew to be harmful without acknowledging \u2014 and sowing doubt and confusion about \u2014 those harms; others are suing over past and future costs to defend against sea level rise; fishermen want compensation for harming a West Coast crab fishery.\n\nThe defense: Fossil fuel companies argue they had no control over how their product was used after selling it. Aka, it\u2019s people who put gasoline in their cars, not Exxon Mobil.\n\n\u2014 The United Nations slammed the \u201cabhorrent\u201d housing conditions Indigenous people face, causing poverty and hardship in Canada and worldwide. One example given by the U.N. rapporteur on adequate housing was availability being so low in the North that Indigenous people had to sleep in shifts. Canadian Press.\n\n\u2014 The provincial cannabis agency in Ontario is studying a greater role for private-sector firms in wholesale distribution, amid concerns about price competitiveness in comparison to the black market. The study, however, did not look into a fully private model similar to that in place in Saskatchewan. Globe & Mail.\n\n\u2014 The International Energy Agency said renewable energy capacity will expand globally by 50 percent, thanks to home and business solar installations. Renewable power generation, by 2024, will make up 30 percent of all energy, up from 26 percent today. Reuters.\n\n\u2014 Crude oil by rail exports fell slightly in August, according to the Canada Energy Regulator. The 310,000 barrels a day is down from July\u2019s 313,000 but up 35 percent from August 2018. Canadian Press.\n\n8 a.m. \u2014 The International Astronautical Federation, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics and the International Institute of Space Law hold the 70th International Astronautical Congress from Oct. 21-25, with a Tuesday session focused on \u201cthe long-term sustainability of outer space.\u201d Walter E.
