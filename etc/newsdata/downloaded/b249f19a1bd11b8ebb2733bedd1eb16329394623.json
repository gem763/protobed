Subsequently, communication from Lander to the ground stations was lost,\" an ISRO official said. The lander was named Vikram after the father of India's space program, Vikram Sarabhai.\n\nA live broadcast from ISRO, India's equivalent of NASA, showed scientists grow tense and the floor fall silent as the control station struggled to get a signal from the lander.\n\n\"There are ups and downs in life ... What you have accomplished is no small achievement,\" Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was present at the ISRO centre, told scientists after being briefed by Sivan.\n\nSivan had earlier described the final moments of the landing mission as \"15 minutes of terror,\" due to the complexities involved with lunar gravity, terrain and dust.\n\nOnly the United States, Russia and China have landed on the moon. Beijing's Chang'e-4 probe touched down on the far side earlier this year. Israel made an unsuccessful attempt to land its Beresheet spacecraft on the moon in April.\n\nThe south pole is believed to contain water as craters in the region are largely unaffected by the high temperatures of the sun. ISRO had hoped to confirm the presence of water in the form of ice, first detected on its mission in 2008.\n\nAdditional reporting by Reuters", "description": "India's attempt to land on the surface of the Moon appears to have ended in failure after its historic spacecraft went missing.
