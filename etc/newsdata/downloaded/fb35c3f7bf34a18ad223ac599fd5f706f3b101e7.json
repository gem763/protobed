Lows: Mid-to-upper 60s.\n\nTomorrow: Mostly cloudy, isolated shower possible.

Sunny skies and warm-but-not-hot temperatures make it a must to spend at least some time outdoors. Enjoy it while you can, as the clouds come in tomorrow, with heat and humidity returning by midweek.

A cool-ish morning with temperatures rising through the 60s into the 70s transitions to a gorgeous afternoon with mostly to partly sunny skies and highs mainly in the low 80s. Some fair-weather clouds are likely to float on by during the afternoon hours and there won\u2019t be as much of a breeze as yesterday, but humidity levels remain well in check! Confidence: High\n\nTonight: A few changes are in store by evening. Most notable is our skies becoming mostly cloudy as a light wind comes from the northeast. And a light shower or two can\u2019t be ruled out late evening or overnight, with lows around the mid-to-upper 60s.

Keep reading for the forecast through midweek...\n\nTomorrow (Monday): Easterly flow coming in off the Atlantic Ocean means two things. First, it\u2019s likely to be a mostly cloudy day. And second, increased moisture means we\u2019ll start to notice the humidity creep up. A few isolated showers may pop up, but they\u2019re probably more the exception than the rule. The clouds hold back temperatures with highs in the mid-70s to near 80. Confidence: Medium\n\nTomorrow night: A few isolated showers may linger into the evening hours before leaving us a partly to mostly cloudy overnight. Any clearing may be \u201cself-defeating,\" possibly allowing temperatures to cool enough for a few pockets of fog to form. In any case, expect lows in the 60s. Confidence: Medium\n\nA LOOK AHEAD\n\nTuesday looks to be a transition day of sorts as high pressure to our northeast weakens and high pressure over the Southeast U.S. starts to exert its influence. As a result, we\u2019ll trend a bit warmer with highs aiming for the low 80s under partly sunny skies. Tuesday night we\u2019re partly cloudy as a breeze from the south keeps us warmer than recent nights, with lows in the upper 60s to low 70s. Confidence: Medium\n\nBy Wednesday, the warmth is back in full swing. The sun is too with mostly sunny skies breaking out and sending highs to near or past 90. With dew points in the upper 60s, you\u2019ll notice the humidity as well. A few showers or storms could also threaten by afternoon or evening.
