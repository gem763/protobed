Trump discussed the proposal during a meeting at the White House after discussing the move with advisers like Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and acting Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Norman Sharpless, Bloomberg reported.\n\n\u201cNot only is it a problem overall, but really specifically with respect for children,\u201d Trump told reporters. He continued, \u201cWe may very well have to do something very, very strong about it.\u201d\n\nSecretary Azar said the FDA would soon issue regulatory guidance to remove flavored vaping products from the market. The secretary cited statistics showing five million children using e-cigarettes of some kind, a number he found \u201calarming.\u201d In December, the US Surgeon General declared underage vaping \u201can epidemic,\u201d laying the groundwork for future regulatory action.\n\nRelated Three people have died of a mysterious lung illness linked to vaping as cases skyrocket\n\nLast week, federal officials announced that over 450 people across the country had grown sick with deadly lung illnesses that have been linked to e-cigarette use. The number of sick people has increased dramatically over the past few weeks, and organizations like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have warned people to halt the use of e-cigarettes entirely.\n\nThe White House\u2019s move comes just one day after former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg called for a ban on flavored e-cigarettes in The New York Times, calling it \u201can urgent health crisis.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been a long year for e-cigarette manufacturers like Juul with threats of regulation being thrown from all across the government. Last summer, lawmakers like Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) proposed similar regulations to what the president floated today. Durbin\u2019s Stopping Appealing Flavors in E-Cigarettes for Kids Act, or the SAFE Kids Act, if approved, would require manufacturers to prove that their flavors do not tempt minors to use the devices.\n\nJuul did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "description": "In a surprise meeting on Wednesday, President Donald Trump pushed to ban all non-tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes from the market, with the backing of the FDA and HHS.", "authors": ["Makena Kelly", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/isWOcGxHD200jy2UxPgKAEmY9Lc=/0x392:5472x3257/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19190162/1173421667.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
