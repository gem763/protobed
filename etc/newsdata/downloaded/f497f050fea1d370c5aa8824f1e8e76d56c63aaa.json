The median price target for the stock is $48, representing an upside of more than 38% to Thursday's close.", "description": "Lengthy UAW strike at GM to cost $1.5 billion: Credit Suisse", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9A144_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
