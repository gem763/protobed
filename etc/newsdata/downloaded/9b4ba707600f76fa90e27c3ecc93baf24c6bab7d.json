Bernie Sanders that billionaires should not exist.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nAsked to respond to the Vermont independent\u2019s declaration that billionaires should not exist, Zuckerberg \u2014 the fifth richest person in the world \u2014 offered an unexpected take.\n\n\u201cI understand where he\u2019s coming from,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I have an exact threshold on what amount of money someone should have but on some level, no one deserves to have that much money.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg, who is worth a staggering $66.6 billion, and his wife Priscilla Chan announced plans almost four years ago to donate 99 percent of their Facebook shares to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a company that uses technology to solve challenges like eradicating disease and reforming the criminal justice system, according to its website.\n\nThe full amount is pledged over the course of Zuckerberg's life, and he will not give more than $1 billion each year in the immediate future. (In a regulatory filing, Zuckerberg said he plans to maintain control of the company \"for the foreseeable future.\")\n\n\u201cI think if you do something that\u2019s good, you get rewarded,\u201d he added. \u201cBut I do think some of the wealth that can be accumulated is unreasonable.\u201d\n\nThe meeting came three days after leaked audio from July, first obtained by the Verge, revealed Zuckerberg candidly discussing some of the sweeping proposals introduced by 2020 hopefuls, including a plan from Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to break up big technology companies.\n\nHe vowed to \u201cgo to the mat\u201d to fight her plan to break up companies like Facebook, Amazon and Google if she\u2019s elected.\n\n\u201cIf she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,\u201d Zuckerberg said at the time. \u201cAnd does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don't want to have a major lawsuit against our own government.\u201d\n\nShortly after the Verge released the audio, Warren responded on Twitter, renewing her criticism of the social media behemoth.\n\n\u201cWhat would really \u2018suck\u2019 is if we don\u2019t fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy,\u201d she wrote.\n\nDuring this week\u2019s Q&A session, Zuckerberg said he stood by his earlier comments about Warren, but added, \u201clet\u2019s try not to antagonize her further.\u201d\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Zuckerberg, worth $66.6 billion, is the fifth-richest person in the world.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/zuckerberg-sanders-AP.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
