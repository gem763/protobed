Do you have any advice about how I can relax around people? \u2014Bronwyn\n\nYou will be relieved to know that most of us tend to underestimate how much people enjoy our company. In 2018, Erica J. Boothby and colleagues published a paper about the \u201cliking gap\u201d\u2014the difference between how much we think other people like us and how much they actually like us. In one of their studies, they asked first-year college students to rate how much they liked a given roommate and how much they believed their roommates liked them, starting in September and continuing throughout the school year.\n\nThey found that participants systematically underestimated how much they were liked. In fact, it wasn\u2019t until May, after living together for eight months, that people accurately perceived how much they were liked. So try to focus your social energy on spending quality time with friends and don\u2019t worry too much about the outcome.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What are your tips for making friends in a new environment? Join the conversation below.\n\nDear Dan,\n\nI work for a nonprofit organization that offers mindfulness retreats for teens. Our tuition model is that we request 1% of a family\u2019s income, up to $2,000, for a week-long retreat. We feel that this model is fair, but some higher-income families object to paying more than others for the same service. Why do they feel this way, when the cost is such a small share of their income? \u2014Tom\n\nOur perception of what is fair depends to a large degree on what we\u2019re being asked to give up to achieve a fair outcome. In your arrangement, people with more money are being asked to pay more, so they are likely to see a fixed price for tuition as being more fair than a sliding scale\u2014and vice versa for families with less money.\n\nOne way to try to overcome this bias is what the political philosopher John Rawls called the \u201cveil of ignorance.\u201d In this approach, people are asked to design an imaginary society they will have to live in, without knowing whether they are going to be rich or poor. This means that they have to decide what is fair before they know how much they will personally stand to gain or lose from any given arrangement\u2014for instance, the tax rate. Maybe you can try an exercise of this sort related to tuition as part of your mindfulness teaching.\n\nHi, Dan.\n\nI have an aging but perfectly fine car and waste a lot of time pining for something more modern and comfortable. But I haven\u2019t found a new model I love, and with technological improvements happening so fast, cars are getting better every year. Should I wait for the perfect car to come along or should I compromise and buy something now? \u2014Alex\n\nMy sense is that if you don\u2019t like any of the available options, it means you\u2019re not yet ready to make a change. Happiness isn\u2019t just about what we have and don\u2019t have; it\u2019s also about not constantly looking for something better. Why don\u2019t you decide that you won\u2019t look at new cars for a certain period\u2014say, two years\u2014and then give yourself a three-month window to research a purchase. At the end of that time, you will pick the best option available. This way, you won\u2019t waste time and energy on an open-ended search.", "description": "A behavioral economist answers questions on making friends, sliding-scale pricing and buying a new car", "authors": ["Dan Ariely"], "top_image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-EW817_ARIELY_SOC_20190904150620.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
