The six goals is just one less than Neal scored in 63 games last season with Calgary.\n\nLucic was still looking for his first point of the season with the Flames heading into Tuesday\u2019s contest against the Los Angeles Kings.\n\nNeal won a silver medal with Canada at the 2009 World Championships and guided the expansion Vegas Golden Knights to the Stanley Cup finals two seasons ago.\n\nNeal began and finished the sequence that ended with his first goal late in the first period.\n\nHe completed his hat trick with two power play goals, scoring from both sides of the Islanders\u2019 goal.\n\nNeal scored his fourth goal from the front of the left faceoff circle 6:51 into the third.", "description": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 James Neal scored a career-high four goals Tuesday as the visiting Edmonton Oilers cruised to a 5-2 win over the New York", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/08/c13a09_james-neal-edmonton-oilers-scores-his-hat-trick-goal-on-power-play-31-period-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
