Or brave. Maybe a bit of both? That was my reaction when I heard that in his highly anticipated career reboot, Dolemite Is My Name, Murphy was setting out to make a big-name, big-budget movie about a man who worked in the outer precincts of Hollywood, making raunchy comedy records and no-name, no-budget blaxploitation flicks that had no desire to become mainstream hits and, for that very reason, became revered cult favorites with black audiences.\n\nThe man\u2019s name was Rudy Ray Moore, and his greatest creation was Dolemite, an acid-tongued, kung fu-kicking ghetto pimp who was a master of toasting, an oral tradition imported from West Africa, verbal sparring contests to tell the tallest tale or land the most devastating insult. And so when Dolemite wants a corrupt cop to get out of his way, he doesn\u2019t say, \u201cPlease.\u201d He says, \u201cMan, step aside and let me pass, fore they have to be pulling these Hush Puppies out yo muthafuckin\u2019 ass.\u201d (Hush Puppies as certified 1970s pimp footwear!) An enemy isn\u2019t merely an enemy to Dolemite, he\u2019s a \u201cno-business, born-insecure, rat-soup-eatin\u2019 junkyard muthafucka.\u201d And to anyone who is doing anything halfway, Dolemite has a standard rebuke: \u201cPut your weight on it!\u201d\n\nAs Moore\u2019s 1975 debut movie, Dolemite, and his home-made party records and stand-up act were acquiring cult status, he refused to tone down the braggadocio or the raunch in order to win the approval of mainstream\u2014that is, white\u2014audiences. He proudly dubbed himself \u201cthe first X-rated comedian.\u201d The titles of the routines on his party records lay it all out: \u201cMr. Big Dick,\u201d \u201cPimpin\u2019 Sam,\u201d \u201cBack Up and Get This Load,\u201d and \u201cHell of a Blow Job,\u201d to name a few. It wasn\u2019t only about sex. In 1972 he mounted a mock campaign for president against Richard Nixon and George McGovern. On the resulting record, a \u201creporter\u201d asks the \u201ccandidate\u201d what he promises to do about unemployment. Moore replies, \u201cI ain\u2019t promising you a goddamn thing. I would open up stealin\u2019. Fuck a job!\u201d Disillusioned black audiences thrilled at the transgressive candor.\n\nWhile other black comedians, including Bill Cosby, Flip Wilson, and even Redd Foxx and Richard Pryor, were working hard to find the crossover sweet spot, Moore chose to \u201cstay on the fringes, below white society\u2019s radar,\u201d in the words of Jim Dawson, author of The Compleat Motherfucker, a book-length study of the evolution of profanity in American comedy. Its low budget and low production values set Dolemite apart from the era\u2019s slick productions aimed at black audiences, including Shaft and SuperFly. Dolemite, like its creator, was all about making do with what you\u2019ve got. What wound up on the screen may have looked cheesy, but it was deliriously so. The wooden fight scenes, the flubbed dialogue, the visible microphone booms\u2014it all added up to an esthetic. And the results were laugh-till-you-cry funny. It was Moore\u2019s refusal to play by someone else\u2019s rules that made him that rarest thing: a true original.\n\nBut the world\u2014or at least a part of it\u2014eventually caught up with iconoclastic, go-it-alone Rudy Ray Moore. He came to be known as \u201cthe godfather of rap\u201d after a new generation embraced his incomparable toasts, sampling his stuff, inviting him to perform on their records and videos. And so fans of 2 Live Crew and Busta Rhymes and Snoop Dogg came to appreciate the wit and magnetism of the man behind Dolemite. Snoop Dogg put it this bluntly: \u201cWithout Rudy Ray Moore there would be no Snoop Dogg, and that\u2019s for real.\u201d Even The New York Times came around to admitting that Dolemite is \u201cthe Citizen Kane of kung fu pimping movies.\u201d\n\nDolemite Is My Name, directed by Craig Brewer and written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, dutifully checks the boxes of Moore\u2019s biography.\n\n\u201c Murphy\u2019s Rudy Ray Moore is, at his core, a classic American dreamer, a hustler out of Jim Crow Arkansas with a searing hunger to make it\u2014but on his own terms \u201d\n\nWe first see him trying unsuccessfully to hustle his records and comedy act while working a day job in Dolphin\u2019s of Hollywood record store in Los Angeles. From the first frames, Eddie Murphy brings the man\u2019s wit and desperation to life. It\u2019s at Dolphin\u2019s that Moore falls under the spell of a neighborhood wino named Rico, who spins rococo tales of a fantastic ghetto avenger named Dolemite. Moore hones his Dolemite act until the magical night when he sheds the skin of a conventional comedian and steps up to a microphone to introduce his new creation: \u201cNow some folks say that Willie Green was the baddest motherfucker the world had ever seen; but I want you to light up a joint and screw your wig on tight, and let me tell you about the bad little motherfucker named Dolemite\u2026\u201d The crowd is stunned and delighted, and a star is born.\n\nMoore proceeds to work himself to the bone on the chitlin circuit until his records start hitting the Billboard charts. Then he pours all of his savings and borrowings\u2014$100,000\u2014into the production of Dolemite. In Dolemite Is My Name, the reviews of the resulting movie-within-a-movie are scathing, but Moore and his posse arrive at the premier in a cherry-red limo after convincing themselves that getting their movie made against such steep odds was itself a major success. Of course, this being a big-budget Netflix movie, the premier of Moore\u2019s shoestring movie is mobbed by adoring fans. A cult is born. Back in the real world, Dolemite took in $12 million at the box office.\n\nEddie Murphy\u2019s Rudy Ray Moore is, at his core, a classic American dreamer, a hustler out of Jim Crow Arkansas with a searing hunger to make it\u2014but on his own terms. Authenticity is everything to him, compromise is out of the question, and the thing he learns on his journey from nobody to under-the-radar somebody is that some things aren\u2019t negotiable. Some things aren\u2019t for sale. This is both the key to his success and the thing that blocked him from mainstream success.\n\nEddie Murphy may have chosen the perfect role for his comeback movie (which is now in limited release in theaters and begins streaming on Netflix on Oct. 25). As a Paramount studio executive said of Murphy back in the \u201990s, when his popularity and power were at their peak: \u201cHe has an ability to say things that you wish you could say.\u201d And: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need anything from anyone.\u201d It\u2019s a perfect description of Rudy Ray Moore.\n\nMoore, who died in 2008 at 81, lived to see a new generation of black performers reap the mainstream fruit of the seeds he planted out there on the ratty fringes of showbiz. Among Moore\u2019s many beneficiaries are Snoop Dogg, Wesley Snipes, and Chris Rock, who all have roles in Dolemite Is My Name. The list is long, and it includes rappers, comedians, musicians, actors, and artists. And, yes, Eddie Murphy is among those beneficiaries. Which makes Dolemite Is My Name both a tribute and a thank-you note. Eddie Murphy may be nuts or he may be brave or he may be a bit of both, but he understands that without Rudy Ray Moore there would be no Eddie Murphy. And that\u2019s for real.", "description": "Always on the fringes, Moore perfected fast-talking insult comedy, almost single-handedly invented blaxsploitation movies, and inspired artists from Snoop Dog to Eddie Murphy.", "authors": ["Bill Morris"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571447965/191018-Morris-Rudy-Ray-Moore-tease_sibuwc", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
