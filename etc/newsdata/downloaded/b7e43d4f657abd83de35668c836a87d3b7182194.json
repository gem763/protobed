Doolittle was on the IL since Aug. 18 with right knee tendinitis, a day after blowing a save in a loss to Milwaukee.\n\nZimmerman\u2019s and Doolitte\u2019s returns didn\u2019t overshadow the rest of the team\u2019s all-around strong performance.\n\nPatrick Corbin (11-6) fanned eight batters and surpassed 200 strikeouts for the year, making Washington the first National League team in 50 years to have three pitchers reach 200 in the same season.\n\nJuan Soto finished 3-4 with two doubles and his 31st home run of the year, one day after he and Anthony Rendon reached 30 homers for the year in back-to-back at-bats.\n\nAnd after homering twice the night before, it was another typical day at work for Rendon, who hit his 32nd dinger of the year and set a Nationals single-season record with 111 RBI.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny because they\u2019re punch-for-punch now in the home runs, you know,\u201d manager Dave Martinez said. \u201cEvery time one of them hits a home run, the other guy tries to match it, so it\u2019s kind of fun. But bar anything else, when you talk to them, they just want to win.\u201d\n\nRendon finished 2-for-3 and moved into first place in the majors in RBI, along with his majors-best .337 batting average, as fans\u2019 chants of \u201cM-V-P\u201d grew louder.\n\nIn the sixth, Yan Gomes followed Zimmerman\u2019s home run with a bullet to the left field foul pole that was upheld as fair after a crew chief review.\n\nZimmerman finished 1-3 with his home run and a walk. He had missed 36 games with a recurring bout of plantar fasciitis in his right foot and had not played for Washington since July 21.\n\nMartinez said Zimmerman \u201creintroduced\u201d himself to the manager Sunday, and the joke around the clubhouse was that the 34-year-old vet was a September call-up.\n\n\u201cZim\u2019s a consummate professional. He gets it,\u201d Martinez said before the game. \u201cI told him, \u2018You\u2019re going to play against some lefties. You\u2019re gonna come off the bench.\u2019 His defense is still really good \u2026 He understands that we have other guys that are having an unbelievable year, and he gets it. He just wants to be part of it, and I want him to be part of it.\u201d\n\nBut Martinez also reminded reporters of Zimmerman\u2019s ability to \u201ccatch fire\u201d \u2014 and after Sunday, it could be a reason for Washington to use more of him down the stretch.\n\nThe Nationals next welcome the New York Mets back to town for a three-game set, which includes 1:05 p.m. starts Monday and Wednesday. Washington will start Joe Ross Monday, with Max Scherzer scheduled for Tuesday.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
