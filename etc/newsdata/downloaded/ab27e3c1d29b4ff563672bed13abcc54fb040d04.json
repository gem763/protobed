To me, these places are beautiful, they need documenting. The people here, they get forgotten by those in power and by gentrification. But the community, it is still strong.\u201d\n\nThe results of his unusual mission is a collection of photos entitled Utopia London Council Estates, exclusively showcased in The Independent.\n\nThey capture the people and the built environment of everywhere from Robin Hood Gardens in Poplar to Thamesmead in Bexley, from the now demolished Heygate estate in Walworth, to tragic Grenfell Tower in Kensington.\n\n\u201cAs a kid growing up in Turin I was fascinated by the culture that came from the English working classes, especially bands like Oasis and The Stone Roses,\u201d says the 31-year-old, who moved on to Rome earlier this year. \u201cSo when I came here in 2011, I suppose I gravitated towards those sort of places. That\u2019s where I liked to have a drink, have a pork pie. I like the people there. They talk to you. They don\u2019t have agendas.\u201d\n\nHe decided to start taking pictures around 2013 and, while working as a professional photographer on various publications, continued this personal project for five years in his spare time.\n\nAmong his images are kids playing on bikes, residents in their flats, police attending incidents and at least one full breakfast with chips.\n\nDespite some of the places he visited having a reputation for crime, he says he never once felt intimidated.\n\n\u201cI know there is that stigma but I think this, it is exaggerated,\u201d he says. \u201cI never had any issues even carrying around cameras. I always felt welcome. People were curious, that is all.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

There\u2019s a picture of one guy who had just had his eye ripped out in an attack. He was in a bad way. But I wanted to get the brutality and the beauty. These two things, they coexist, not just in London high-rises but everywhere. That\u2019s the human condition. That\u2019s part of the point.\u201d\n\nHe is hoping to return to the UK next year for a full exhibition.", "description": "Marco Sconocchia accepts he must have seemed an unusual prospect.
