(LDF), I write to strongly oppose the confirmation of Mr. Steven Menashi for a seat on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals,\u201d said the group\u2019s president, Sherrilyn Ifill, in a Friday letter to Senate leaders.\n\nMenashi \u201chas dedicated the majority of his legal career to rolling back critical civil rights protections for minority communities. He has an extensive portfolio of writings which offend and demean almost all protected classes, including the African-American community,\u201d Ifill said. \u201cDuring his confirmation hearing, Mr. Menashi made no serious effort to assuage any of the concerns of the civil rights community.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a copy of the LDF letter.\n\nMenashi, 40, is currently a White House legal adviser to Trump, meaning the president nominated his own staffer to a lifetime seat on a U.S. circuit court.\n\nIfill\u2019s concerns with Menashi echo progressive groups like Demand Justice and Center for Popular Democracy, whose supporters have protested and even gotten arrested in their efforts to sink Menashi\u2019s nomination. They have singled out Menashi\u2019s record when he served as legal counsel to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. In 2017, he helped her roll back Title IX protections for survivors of sexual assault on campuses.\n\nBeyond that, Menashi has a long record of opposing and undermining equality for communities of color and women. As CNN first reported, Menashi has complained about \u201cgynocentrists\u201d participating in Take Back the Night marches, accused the Human Rights Campaign of having \u201cincessantly exploited the slaying of Matthew Shepard\u201d for political benefit, and claimed that a Dartmouth fraternity wasn\u2019t being racist when it held a \u201cghetto party\u201d attended by white partygoers wearing Afro wigs and carrying toy guns.\n\nHe has also denounced women\u2019s marches as sexual assault, opposed the \u201cradical abortion rights advocated by campus feminists and codified in Roe v. Wade,\u201d and spread the Islamophobic myth that Gen. John Pershing executed Muslim prisoners in the Philippines in 1913 with bullets dipped in pig fat.\n\nMenashi didn\u2019t do himself any favors last month in his confirmation hearing, either. Not only does he lack support from both of his New York home-state senators, but he also visibly angered Republicans and Democrats on the committee by refusing to give details on what he\u2019s worked on at the White House.\n\nThat led to at least one Republican on the committee, Sen. John Kennedy (La.), telling HuffPost in mid-September that he\u2019s \u201creal doubtful\u201d he can support him.\n\nIn light of the House launching an impeachment inquiry into the president, Democrats on the committee wrote to Menashi on Friday with follow-up questions about his potential involvement in Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, during which Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate political rival former Vice President Joe Biden. The call is at the center of the investigation into the president\u2019s actions.\n\nIt only takes one Republican \u201cno\u201d on the committee to kill a nomination, assuming all Democrats vote no. Kennedy told HuffPost on Friday that he\u2019s still undecided. Aides to Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), both on the committee, have not responded to repeated requests for comement on whether they plan to support Menashi.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear when \u2015 or if \u2015 the Judiciary Committee will schedule a vote to advance Menashi\u2019s nomination to the full Senate floor.", "description": "He has \"dedicated the majority of his legal career to rolling back critical civil rights protections,\" the NAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund said.", "authors": ["Senior Politics Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d938c62210000310051246e.jpeg?cache=qftkd1kn5k&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
