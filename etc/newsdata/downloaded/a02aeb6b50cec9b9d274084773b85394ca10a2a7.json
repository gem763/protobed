In April 2018, then-Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen received an official policy memo urging the widespread implementation of family separations along the southwest border. The memo was signed by McAleenan, Francis Cissna, then head of U.S. Customs and Immigration Services, and Tom Homan, then acting ICE director.\n\nActing Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan.

Ultimately, they write, \u201cNielsen finally gave in at the beginning of May, after a morning of relentless calls from McAleenan, Homan and others.\u201d\n\nProtesters interrupt a speech by McAleenan at the Immigration Law and Policy Conference in Washington, Oct. 7, 2019.

He has denied reports that Trump is seeking to reimpose the controversial policy.\n\nThis week, protesters against the administration's hard-line immigration agenda prevented McAleenan from delivering a speech at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute\u2019s annual Immigration Law and Policy Conference. The DHS later released McAleenan\u2019s prepared remarks, in which he\u2019d planned to defend the administration\u2019s controversial response to the influx of families and children at the southern border.\n\nThough he has been a key figure in carrying out the administration\u2019s agenda on the border, a recent Washington Post profile described McAleenan, a career official who has not been formally nominated for the role of DHS secretary, as \u201can outsider in Trump World\u201d who has become increasingly uncomfortable with the politicization of the DHS.\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan was one of the drivers of the Trump administration\u2019s now abandoned policy of separating migrant families at the southern border \u2014 a position he has since disavowed as \u201cnot worth\u201d the ensuing public relations disaster.", "authors": ["Caitlin Dickson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/dVWdn7xHSqSLsRhA6BSUfA--~B/aD0yMTIwO3c9MzE4MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/d04cfbc0-e9fb-11e9-bffd-67c974275b75", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
