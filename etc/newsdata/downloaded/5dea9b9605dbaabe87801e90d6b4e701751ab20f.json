For over a decade, the television show helped bring drag culture into the mainstream.\n\nJennifer Graylock-Graylock.com\n\n\u201cI\u2019m versatile. Sometimes I\u2019m a princess. Sometimes I\u2019m a villain. Today I\u2019m obviously a princess,\u201d said Nina West, who won the title of Miss Congeniality in the show\u2019s eleventh season.\n\nAt the conference, West greeted long lines of fans while dressed in an all-white gown and a Dolly Parton-style blonde wig.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have a lot of role models growing up and so now I have the opportunity to be a role model for others,\u201d said West. \u201cI take this responsibility seriously and want to bring hope to people in a time that\u2019s otherwise not very hopeful.\u201d\n\nBrooke Lynn Hytes, who was also at DragCon, appeared on \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" with West. Perched on a dark blue couch and wearing neon heels, Hytes said she is happy to have remained close to West.\n\nJennifer Graylock-Graylock.com\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for us to keep in touch, but the show has made us closer,\u201d said Hytes who hails from Canada and is referred to by fans as \u201cQueen of the North.\"\n\n\u201cIf I was a Disney princess I\u2019d be Pocahontas because she has the best hair. If I was a villain I\u2019d be Maleficent,\u201d said Hytes.\n\nAlso at the conference were Vanessa Vanjie Mateo and \"RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars\" season four champion, Mon\u00e9t X Change. The two stood next to each other in leather and camouflage. \u201cWe aren\u2019t really friends. We are just smiling for the cameras!\u201d said Vanjie while Mon\u00e9t nodded in agreement.\n\nThe longest lines of fans belonged to Vanjie, who sashayed her way into the hearts of drag fans after being the first queen eliminated in season 10 of the TV show. Her larger-than-life exit from the show catapulted her to stardom and got her back onto season 11, where she became a top five finalist.\n\nVendors from across the country displayed their dazzling designs, high-end wigs, sparkly kaftans and campy art. Panel sessions at the conference ranged from politics to beauty tips, including the workshop \u201cDisney on Broadway: Serving Hair Face and Looks for 25 years.\u201d RuPaul also had a one-on-one conversation with Whoopi Goldberg.\n\nAmong the activities at DragCon was Kid Zone\u2014a space accommodating families and groups of all ages. Kids had the chance to participate in the Drag Queen Story Hour.\n\nJennifer Graylock-Graylock.com\n\nJonathan Bloom brought his three kids to the story hour on Sunday, the last day of the three-day convention.\n\n\u201cMy husband is jealous that he\u2019s not able to join us,\u201d said Bloom, whose oldest daughter, Ruby, is transgender.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more than just boys and girls and we want all of our kids to know that they can be whoever they are,\u201d Bloom said. \u201cAnd the show of love and acceptance here is wonderful.\u201d", "description": "Manhattan\u2019s Jacob Javits Center was transformed into a glittery oasis at the third annual RuPaul\u2019s DragCon event.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/dragcon-1-ht-er-190908_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
