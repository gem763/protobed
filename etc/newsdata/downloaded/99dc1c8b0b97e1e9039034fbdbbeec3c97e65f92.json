Karen was a psychiatric nurse and I was a senior social worker. We lived together soon after \u2013 like the old joke: what does a lesbian take on her second date? A removal van.\n\nAfter spending some time living in Australia, it was when we got back to the UK and bought our house that we started to think about having a family. Ever since I was in my 20s, I\u2019d had thoughts of having a child; my sister has four, whom I adore. I\u2019ve been so lucky to fall in love with someone who also wanted to be a mum, and we have been blessed to have two children who enrich our lives.\n\nI remember Clause 28, which said that we were a pretend family. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important for me to be visible, for my family to be visible. We haven\u2019t got rainbow flags outside the house, but we\u2019re visible in our community and at work.\n\nKaren Tunnicliffe Young, 43\n\nWhen Helen and I got together, a lot of people weren\u2019t happy with the idea of us as a couple. We left for Australia, where we didn\u2019t have to worry about what other people thought. Once we had spent time together where we could be ourselves, we came back.\n\nHow we live together: the father and son Read more\n\nThe challenges of same-sex parenting are outside the home. It began when our son, Stanley, eight, started nursery and he talked about not having a father. So we got a few books from the Donor Conception Network to help us explain to him.\n\nAll the children in his class know that he has a mum and a mama. But there were hardly any books where Stanley and his sister, Esmie, five, could see our family reflected, so I wrote my own, Our Mummies And Us Go Camping.\n\n\u2022 If you have a story to tell about who you live with, fill in this form and tell us a little about your set-up.", "description": "We haven\u2019t got rainbow flags outside the house, but it\u2019s important to be visible", "authors": ["Chris Hall"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a1638d02f311bfa3563aa223f9e2d79b8230554/0_248_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=218a43b35feeb2e97e987cb34aee4bee", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
