He said he hasn\u2019t been back home since Hurricane Dorian devastated the islands in August.\n\n\u201cObviously it\u2019s terrible what has happened to the Bahamas,\u201d he said, adding his home didn\u2019t sustain much damage. \u201cI\u2019m going to try to see what I can do to give back.\u201d\n\nFellow Canadian Vasek Pospisil upset 14th-seeded Diego Schwartzman of Argentina 7-6 (2), 6-2 in another first-round match.\n\nThe 10th-seeded Fabio Fognini of Italy faced little resistance from American Sam Querrey in a 6-4, 6-2 victory.\n\nAndy Murray, playing on a wildcard, faces Argentine qualifier Juan Ignacio Londero in Monday\u2019s first night match.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Tennis: https://www.apnews.com/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Denis Shapovalov defeated Frances Tiafoe 6-4, 6-2 at the Shanghai Masters on Monday, setting up a second-round encounter with defending champion Novak Djokovic.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Sandra Harwitt"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
