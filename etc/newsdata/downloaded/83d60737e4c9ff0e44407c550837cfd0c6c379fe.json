Biden said Friday that the claim has no credibility.\n\nBiden released a statement Friday criticizing Trump for the alleged phone call, demanding the president release a transcript and the whistleblower's complaint.\n\nWHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT, REPORTEDLY ON TRUMP 'PROMISE' TO FOREIGN LEADER, TOUCHES OFF DC FIRESTORM\n\n\"This behavior is particularly abhorrent because it exploits the foreign policy of our country and undermines our national security for political purposes,\" the statement read.\n\nHannity blasted the media for ignoring Biden's possible corruption.\n\n\"I didn't see anyone in the mob interested in that story but I do think the media mob, you have opened the door now for a national discussion about, well, what did Biden and his son do -- and when did they do it?\" Hannity said. \"And what kind of interference was the Ukraine involved in as relates to our 2016 election?
