He was far from being shy.'\n\nMr Williams said Trevor was one of the most aggressive crocodile he had ever worked with and was 'stubborn'.\n\nHe was found in the water floating on his back, with reports confirming he died as a result of head injuries from a boat's propeller blades\n\nWhile he has worked with a number of crocodiles in the river, he told Nine News that seeing Trevor jump 'never got less cool'.\n\n'The first time I saw him jumping and flying out of the water I was completely dumbstruck,' he said.\n\n'Trevor tended to be a crocodile that most people either loved or hated. But most people loved him.\n\n'If you were outside the boat he wouldn't hesitate to take you out. But we still love them. We just know the limits we have with them.'", "description": "The monstrous five-metre-long crocodile, named Trevor, was found dead in the Northern Territory's Adelaide River.", "authors": ["Lauren Ferri For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/04/20067162-0-image-a-3_1571802148692.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
