Maybe Andrew Marr can apologise to Priti Patel now.\u201d", "description": "Viewers were divided over whether the Home Secretary was laughing at the concerns or whether she was presenting a neutral expression", "authors": ["Nicola Bartlett"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20571605.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Priti-Patel.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
