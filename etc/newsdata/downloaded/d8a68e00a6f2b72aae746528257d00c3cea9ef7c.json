It shows that culling badgers can cause surviving individuals in an area to move around more, and as a result they could come into contact with infected cattle and help to spread TB.\n\n\u201cThe ill-thought out plan to control TB by killing badgers could therefore backfire.\u201d\n\nScientists say the changes were witnessed as soon as culling began, meaning even badgers that were killed may have first spread the infection over wider areas while the scheme was being implemented.\n\nHowever, the animals spent less time outside of their setts in culled areas \u2013 on average, 91 minutes less per night.\n\nResearchers believe this could be linked to reduced competition and increased food availability as badgers are removed from the population.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It found that culls disrupt local populations and drive them into previously uninfected areas.\n\nScientists at Scotland\u2019s Rural College found that unless strict rules are followed, it may be better to carry out no culling at all rather than continuing an ineffective operation that makes things worse.\n\nLead author and ZSL-Imperial PhD researcher Cally Ham said: \u201cBadgers spend a large proportion of the night foraging for food above ground, and as culling reduces the size of the population, competition for food will also be reduced.\n\n\u201cWe believe this accounts for the reduced activity levels, as well as bold individuals becoming obvious targets for culling and being quickly removed from the population.\n\n\u201cBecause culling partly relies on shooting badgers moving around at night, the fact that badgers were active for fewer hours per night could actually be undermining culling efforts to further control badger numbers.\u201d\n\nLast year the government commissioned a review of its strategy for tackling bovine tuberculosis in livestock amid ongoing controversy about badger culling to control the disease.\n\nMeasures to tackle the disease include cattle testing and movement controls, improving \u201cbiosecurity\u201d or protective measures to prevent disease spread on farms, developing vaccines for cattle and badgers, and culling badgers \u2013 which can spread TB to cattle \u2013 in 32 areas of England.\n\nThe independent review found farmers must do more to tackle the spread of TB between cattle, which is a bigger part of the problem than badgers.\n\nWhile it said that culling showed a \u201creal but modest effect\u201d and was a judgement call for ministers, the review led by Sir Charles Godfray said poor uptake of biosecurity measures and trading in high-risk livestock was hampering disease control.\n\nSince the government implemented the culling policy in 2011, ZSL scientists have been working to understand whether badger vaccination could be used to reduce the infection of TB in the UK\u2019s badger population, and so help control TB in cattle.\n\nEllie Brodie, senior policy manager at The Wildlife Trusts, said: \u201cThis new study further shows that instead of helping to control TB, culling badgers can in fact contribute to spreading the disease across ever larger areas.\n\n\u201cBadgers live in tight-knit groups but culling disrupts their normal behaviour as survivors roam to new fields that can be shared with cattle. Vaccinating badgers is a positive solution to controlling TB in the badger population and one we urge the government to invest in\u201d.\n\nA spokesperson for the Badger Trust said: \u201cThe latest research from ZSL shows that this mass destruction of a protected species could be resulting in perturbation, increasing the risk of TB spread in badgers and possibly cattle.\n\n\u201cBadger vaccination is the most cost effective and humane way of reducing TB in badgers that do not have the disease. It also removes the risk of perturbation and brings farmers and wildlife protection groups together in a spirit of mutual respect, trust and confidence.\n\n\u201cThe government should halt the culling of badgers and move to a national badger vaccination strategy.\u201d\n\nA Defra spokesperson said: \u201cBovine TB remains the greatest animal health threat to the UK, costing taxpayers over \u00a3100m every year as well as causing devastation and distress for farmers and rural communities.\n\n\u201cThere is no single measure that will provide an easy answer to beating the disease and we are pursuing a range of interventions to eradicate it by 2038, including tighter cattle movement controls, regular testing and vaccinations.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by PA", "description": "The government\u2019s claim that culling badgers reduces tuberculosis rates in cattle has come under fire after a major study\u00a0suggested it could be making the problem worse. \u00a0 Killing off badgers sees the creatures that survive\u00a0cover 61 per cent more land each month, say scientists from the Zoological Society of London and Imperial College of London.
