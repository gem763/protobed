REUTERS/Moe Doiron More\n\nCompetition in the fast-food industry has been high, as companies like Wendy\u2019s (WEN) announced last month that it would be making yet another attempt to join the select group of fast-food restaurants offering up breakfast. Wendy\u2019s said that it would be hiring an additional 20,000 workers for the early 2020 launch.\n\nWhile breakfast is the most profitable day part for fast-food restaurants, it is also one of the most challenging.\n\nIn order to blunt the mounting challenges, McDonald\u2019s has announced new partnerships with third-party aggregators during its third quarter, ramping up its availability on food delivery apps. McDonald\u2019s has partnerships with DoorDash, Uber Eats (UBER) and Grubhub (GRUB).\n\nAfter the recent plant-based meat hype in the U.S. following Beyond Meat\u2019s (BYND) explosive IPO in early May, McDonald\u2019s announced that it would be testing out Beyond Meat burgers in 28 Canadian stores in September.\n\nIn addition, McDonald\u2019s has been aggressively investing in technology to advance its business this year. In March, the burger giant bought Dynamic Yield for $300 million, its biggest acquisition in more than 20 years.\n\nThe investment in Dynamic Yield will help McDonald\u2019s create a personalized drive-thru menu for its customers for an enhanced ordering experience. Then in September, McDonald\u2019s announced that it will be purchasing an early stage voiced-based tech company Apprente. The purchase was yet another attempt to use tech to create a better drive-thru experience for customers. Customers will soon be able to drive up to the drive-thru and speak to a voice-powered machine to place orders.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s shares rose 20% in 2019 and were roughly in line with the S&P 500\u2019s (^GSPC) 21% gain during the same time period.\n\nThe conference call with management will kick off at 11 a.m. ET.\n\nThis post is developing.
