That arranged a final between a 15th-ranked Canadian who called it \u201csurreal\u201d in her first U.S. Open main draw and a legend nearing 38 but looking happy in her movement on court and her untroubled countenance off it. Quintessential evidence came midway through Williams\u2019s second set, when she chased down a decent drop shot, flicked it cross-court for a winner and hovered over a chair, watching it travel and land in pretty obedience.\n\n\u201cI felt more prepared this tournament,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI mean, Wimbledon, I probably had a week to prepare, so that was amazing. Australia, I was super-prepared. I did great, then rolled my ankle [in the quarterfinals against Karolina Pliskova]. I shouldn\u2019t have even played the French Open. That was just a bonus just to compete in another Grand Slam.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI just feel like I actually had time to train. I joked I trained more for Canada [last month] than I did for any other tournament this year, which is kind of funny.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nShe reached the final there with four considerable wins, \u00adincluding one over Naomi Osaka, then retired at 3-1 of the first set with back spasms against Andreescu. What seemed an impediment now seems a blip as Williams will try Saturday to refrain from outcomes that went as follows: a 6-3, 6-3 loss to Angelique Kerber in the 2018 Wimbledon final; a 6-2, 6-4 loss to Osaka in the 2018 U.S. Open final; and a 6-2, 6-2 loss to a sublime Simona Halep in the 2019 Wimbledon final.\n\nIf she resembles the player from the semifinal, always a question in a final \u2014 \u201cThere\u2019s so many different emotions in finals,\u201d she said \u2014 it looks like enough against anyone. The winners went 34-11 in her favor. She kept her unforced errors at a manageable 20 (to Svitolina\u2019s 17). And she plied an long-established Williams trade, that of the nerveless sovereignty on the pivotal point.\n\nAD\n\nIn the first, second and fifth games, Svitolina, who beat Williams in the Rio de Janeiro Olympics in their previous meeting and who had lost zero sets here, had a combined 12 break points or game points. She got none of those. \u201cHad the chances, but in the same time she played really, really focused and very precise on those two games,\u201d the Ukrainian said.\n\nAD\n\nTwelve moments: four Williams winners, one Williams ace, four forced errors, one Svitolina double fault, two Svitolina unforced errors. Svitolina felt those points gave Williams \u201cthe push to play more freely,\u201d but also said: \u201cBut again, that\u2019s why she is who she is. You are playing in front of the best tennis player in the world. If you don\u2019t take it, she just grabs it, and there\u2019s no chance to take it back.\u201d\n\nAfter those five games, Williams led 4-1. In the second set, she became even a notch more airtight, and for good whiles it seemed Svitolina had no way to get a ball past her. Then they concluded and complimented each other, and the sport had come back to a familiar threshold.\n\nAD\n\nThat threshold will find Williams again trying to pull even with Court, who won 13 of her Grand Slams before the Open era began in 1968 and 11 more afterward. It will find Williams seeking a seventh U.S. Open title 20 years after her first, of which she said: \u201cAt 17, I thought for sure I\u2019d be retired at 28, 29, living my life. So, yeah, I would have thought [still playing at 37] was a sick joke.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIt will find Williams against someone not yet born in 1999 yet who has rocked the sport in 2019 with a steep ascent fueled by a sudden title in late winter at Indian Wells and who epitomizes what Williams said when she stopped herself mid-sentence and wisecracked, \u201cIt\u2019s cool because I\u2019m playing in an era with \u2014 five eras with so many amazing players.\u201d And finally, it will star a working mother of 37 who moved around well enough Thursday night to win 10 marathon points out of 13.\n\n\u2014 Chuck Culpepper\n\nAD\n\nIn-match updates\n\nGame, set match: Williams def. Svitolina, 6-3, 6-1\n\nWilliams moved on with ease to her second straight U.S. Open final, where she\u2019ll play for her seventh title and the chance, once again, to tie Margaret Court\u2019s record of 24 Grand Slam singles titles. The 37-year-old played perhaps her best match of the tournament, considering No. 5 seed Svitolina\u2019s top-notch defense and counterpunching. Williams overpowered the Ukranian with 34 winners.\n\nAD\n\nSecond set: Williams takes an early break, 2-1\n\nWilliams won a thrilling, 13-shot rally \u2014 one of the longest of the match so far \u2014 then converted on break point to extend her lead in the second set.\n\nAD\n\nFirst set: Williams wins, 6-3\n\nWilliams took her ninth straight set this U.S. Open and is just one away from another final. She\u2019s moving well and her shots are on target. Svitolina seems to have lost some of the verve she had early on this match.\n\nFirst set: Williams goes up 4-1\n\nThe 2018 runner-up is cooking now. It looked as though Williams\u2019 shots were just a hair off earlier in this set \u2014 she missed a backhand down the line that she rarely misses and over-hit a forehand slam \u2014 but looks more and more comfortable as the set rolls on. A powerful serve-and-volley to save break point (she\u2019s saved six so far) was particularly impressive.\n\nAD\n\nFirst set: Williams takes a 3-0 edge\n\nAD\n\nNineteen minutes later, and we\u2019ve made it through \u2026 three games. Williams started shifting into a higher gear in the third game of this set after a competitive, back-and-forth start, and she looks to be rounding into form. The last game was by far her most dominant.\n\nFor starters: Williams leads, 1-0\n\nSvitolina took Williams to deuce (three times!) after the 23-time Grand Slam champion started her first service game with two errors. Svitolina is testing Williams\u2019 movement more than any opponent has yet this U.S. Open \u2014 and to much success, but Williams eked out the game.\n\nAt U.S. Open, Althea Gibson statue has become an essential stop: \u2018It means we\u2019re no longer hidden\u2019\n\nPost-match reading\n\nFirst semifinal: No. 5 seed Elina Svitolina vs. No. 8 seed Serena Williams\n\nAD\n\nWilliams surged into another Grand Slam semifinal Tuesday with an absolute flattening of Qiang Wang, a 6-1, 6-0 affair in the quarterfinals that seemed to stress neither her mind nor the right ankle she rolled a few days earlier. The pressure, of course, ramps up now, as Williams is (again) two wins away from capturing her record-tying 24th Grand Slam singles title.\n\nAD\n\nA win for Williams in Thursday\u2019s semifinal, the first of the night, would also tie Chris Evert\u2019s record of 101 singles victories at the U.S. Open. But first, Williams must get through 24-year-old Elina Svitolina, a Ukrainian who\u2019s one of the best on tour at counterpunching \u2014 not just defending, but absorbing her opponent\u2019s power and redirecting it with a crafty shot. Svitolina, ranked No. 5 in the world, has rolled through such power players as Venus Williams and Madison Keys without dropping a set in New York thus far. Critically for Svitolina\u2019s confidence, she also owns a win against Williams, which came at the 2016 Summer Olympics. Before then, the Ukrainian had lost four straight matches against the 37-year-old.\n\nIn her last five Grand Slam events, Williams has advanced to the finals three times, losing all three championship matches.\n\nAs Serena Williams eyes history at the U.S. Open, a topsy-turvy field just tries to keep up\n\nSecond semifinal: No. 13 seed Belinda Bencic vs. No. 15 seed Bianca Andreescu\n\nAD\n\nIn Thursday\u2019s second semifinal, current prodigy meets former prodigy when 19-year-old Bianca Andreescu faces 22-year-old Belinda Bencic.\n\nAndreescu, the Canadian daughter of Romanian immigrants who beat Elise Mertens 3-6, 6-2, 6-3 Wednesday night, hadn\u2019t so much as played a main-draw match at the U.S. Open before this year. But her success is somewhat unsurprising: The teenager has been on a tear this year. She\u2019s 7-10 against top 10 players this season, 13-3 in three-set matches, and she hasn\u2019t lost a completed match since March. That last stat is somewhat misleading \u2014 Andreescu missed most of the clay-court season and all of the grass-court season with a rotator cuff injury \u2014 but it does speak to her talent on hard courts, where her all-court game and incredible power really shine. Should Andreescu beat Bencic, she would have a chance to become the first Canadian to win a Grand Slam singles title.\n\nBut Bencic, who beat Donna Vekic 7-6 (7-5), 6-3 in the quarterfinals, is a tricky opponent. With a (you guessed it) all-court game crafted by Melanie Molitor, Martina Hingis\u2019s mother and coach, Bencic is not only a talented attacker and powerful server, she\u2019s also no stranger to big moments at the U.S. Open. Fans may remember her as the precocious 17-year-old who made the quarterfinals in 2014; this year, she became the first Swiss woman since Hingis in 2001 to reach the Final Four in New York.\n\nRead more:\n\nRafael Nadal rolls into U.S. Open semifinals with straight-set win over Diego Schwartzman\n\nRoger Federer wilts in fifth set as unseeded Grigor Dimitrov advances to U.S. Open semifinals\n\nSerena Williams cruises into semifinals of U.S. Open with her 100th career win in the event", "description": "Williams made quick work of Svitolina en route a chance at her seventh U.S. Open title.", "authors": ["Chuck Culpepper", "Reporter Who Covers National College Football", "College Basketball", "Tennis", "Golf", "International Sports.", "Ava Wallace", "Reporter Covering Local Colleges"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/CVscWiqMafe8ab3qybSlCNIoKoc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RCWXBFWQHEI6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg"}
