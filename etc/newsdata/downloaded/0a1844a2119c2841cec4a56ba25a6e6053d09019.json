The Plus card charges a $69 annual fee, while the Premier and Priority cards charge $99 and $149, respectively.\n\nThe anniversary bonuses are also different for each card:\n\nBoth the Premier and Priority cards do not charge a foreign transaction fee, and both cards can earn you Tier-Qualifying Points (TQPs) toward Southwest A-List status. You'll earn 1,500 TQPs for every $10,000 you spend on the cards in a calendar year, on up to $100,000 (15,000 TQPs) in spending each year. A-List status required 35,000 TQPs earned in a calendar year, and gets you benefits like priority boarding and a 25% points bonus on paid flights.\n\nBut Priority cardholders get a few extra perks:\n\n$75 Southwest annual travel credit.\n\nFour upgraded boardings per year when available\n\n20% back on in-flight drinks and Wi-Fi\n\nAll three cards come with a 40,000-point sign-up bonus if you spend at least $1,000 within three months of opening your account, plus another 20,000 points when you spend $12,000 in the first 12 months.\n\nEach card also gives 2 points per dollar spent on Southwest and Rapid Rewards purchases and 1 point per dollar spent on everything else.\n\nAdditionally, the sign-up bonus and points you earn on all three personal Southwest credit cards count toward the Southwest Companion Pass. The Companion Pass is a benefit that lets you designate a friend or family member to travel with you for free on all your paid and award flights on Southwest \u2014 all they'll have to pay are taxes and fees. You need to earn 110,000 qualifying points in a calendar year to get this perk, or take 100 one-way qualifying flights on Southwest in a calendar year.\n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards consumer credit cards: Which card is right for you?\n\nIf your main goal for getting a Southwest Rapid Rewards credit card is to earn a sign-up bonus, the Southwest Rapid Rewards Plus card could be a great choice. It offers the same 40,000-point sign-up bonus as the other two cards and the same earnings rate, and it has the lowest annual fee.\n\nBut if you plan to use your Rapids Rewards card for multiple years, the Premier and Priority cards offer better value. Both offer anniversary bonuses that are double or more what you'll get with the Plus card. And the two more expensive cards are better for overseas travelers too, since they don't charge foreign transaction fees.\n\nWhen comparing the Premier and Priority cards, the Priority card easily comes out on top. Its higher annual fee is easily reduced by the $75 annual Southwest travel credit. It also has a better anniversary bonus and offers additional in-flight perks and discounts.\n\nIn short, if you're looking for a \"one-time use\" airline card to earn one or two free flights, you may want to choose the Southwest Rapid Rewards Plus card. Otherwise, the Southwest Rapid Rewards Priority card offers the best long-term value.\n\nFinally, note that you can't have two personal Southwest credit cards at the same time, and you can't open a new personal Southwest card if you've earned a sign-up bonus on any personal Southwest card within the last 24 months. So choose your card carefully.\n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards business credit cards: The biggest differences\n\nAlyssa Powell/Business Insider\n\nSouthwest has two co-branded business credit cards: the Southwest Rapids Rewards Premier Business card and the Southwest Rapid Rewards Performance Business card.\n\nThe Premier Business card charges a $99 annual fee, while the Performance Business card is more expensive, at $199. However, the Performance Business card has a better anniversary bonus, giving 9,000 points each cardmember anniversary compared to the 6,000 points you'll get each year with the Premier Business card.\n\nThe biggest difference between these two cards is their ongoing earnings potential. While you'll earn 2 points per dollar on Southwest and Rapid Rewards purchases with the Premier Business Card, you'll earn 3 points per dollar with the Performance Business card.\n\nAnd with the Performance Business card, you'll earn 2 points per dollar on the following business expenses as well:\n\nSocial media and search engine advertising\n\nInternet, cable, and phone services\n\nThe Performance Business card also gives cardholders up to $100 for a Global Entry or TSA Pre application fee credit, four upgraded boardings per year (when available), and in-flight Wi-Fi credits. It's offering an 80,000-point sign-up bonus after you spend at least $5,000 within your first three months with the card.\n\nThe Premier Business Card is offering a 60,000-point sign-up bonus after you spend $3,000 in the first three months. Neither card charges foreign transaction fees.\n\nAs with the personal Southwest credit cards, the points you earn from the business Southwest cards' sign-up bonuses (as well as from everyday spending) count toward the Companion Pass.\n\nRead more: The best small business credit cards\n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards business credit cards: Which card is right for you?\n\nIf your business spends a lot of money each year on social media advertising or internet, cable, and phone services, you'll definitely want to go with the Southwest Rapid Rewards Performance Business card.\n\nYou may also want to choose the Performance Business card if you fly four or more times each year. In that case, you could take full advantage of the four upgraded room boardings per year and some of the other in-flight perks.\n\nHowever, if you don't spend a lot of money in the bonus categories, your earnings potential will drop. And if you only fly once or twice a year, you may not get the most value out of the additional flight-day benefits.\n\nIn these cases, you may be better off choosing the Southwest Rapid Rewards Premier Business card. It offers a lower sign-up bonus and 2x points rather than 3x points on Southwest purchases, but its annual fee is $100 lower.\n\nBottom line\n\nDeciding which Southwest credit card is right for you requires evaluating your particular situation and spending habits. Begin by considering how you plan to use your Southwest credit card, then pick whichever one is the best fit for you.\n\nMore credit card coverage", "description": "Southwest has three personal credit cards and two business credit cards.
