Did he ask you to do these things?\u201d CBS\u2019s Margaret Brennan asked Giuliani during Sunday\u2019s episode of \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe did not,\u201d said Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City. \u201cBut when I talked to the secretary last week, he said that he was aware of it.\u201d\n\n.@RudyGiuliani tells @margbrennan that Secretary Pompeo did not instruct him to reach out to Ukranians, but was \u201caware\u201d pic.twitter.com/wtS0tLJ3mO \u2014 Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) September 29, 2019\n\nThe complaint, authored by an unnamed U.S. intelligence official, alleges Trump repeatedly pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into Biden and his son during a July phone call and that the White House tried to cover up the conversation.\n\nThe whistleblower named Giuliani as a \u201ccentral figure\u201d in this effort and alleged U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations Kurt Volker advised Ukrainian officials on how to \u201cnavigate\u201d Trump\u2019s demands. Volker resigned Friday after the complaint was released to the public a day earlier.\n\nGiuliani has repeatedly claimed that his meetings with Ukrainian operatives were carried out at the State Department\u2019s behest, but Sunday marked the first time he has suggested Pompeo had direct knowledge of his efforts.\n\nGiuliani told CBS that Volker called him on July 19, six days before Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky, to ask if he would meet Andriy Yermak, one of Zelensky\u2019s top aides. He said he then met with Yermak and later debriefed Volker and U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland about their exchange.\n\n\u201cAt the time, they didn\u2019t mention the secretary of state,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cWhen I spoke to the secretary last week, I said, \u2018Are you aware of this?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Yes, I know about this.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe State Department did not immediately respond to a HuffPost request for comment.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Tuesday to formally announce an impeachment inquiry into Trump.\n\nGiuliani said earlier Sunday that he\u2019s \u201cproud of what he did\u201d and that he would cooperate with the impeachment inquiry if Trump asked him to.\n\n\u201cI have to be guided by my client,\u201d he told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d referring to Trump. \u201cIf he decides that he wants me to testify, of course, I\u2019ll testify \u2015 even though I think Adam Schiff is an illegitimate [House Intelligence Committee] chairman.\u201d\n\nSchiff said Sunday that he hasn\u2019t decided whether he wants Giuliani to testify.\n\nNEW: Asked repeatedly if he would cooperate with House Intelligence Committee, Rudy Giuliani tells @ThisWeekABC, \"I wouldn't cooperate with Adam Schiff,\" but then says he would \"consider\" it were chair Adam Schiff removed. https://t.co/S0bTTE1vKj pic.twitter.com/gszI6zeRUV \u2014 This Week (@ThisWeekABC) September 29, 2019\n\nWatch Giuliani\u2019s full interview on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d below:\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nRudy Giuliani Says He Won't Testify Before House Without Trump's OK\n\nCNN's Jake Tapper Slams GOP Congressman's Indifference On Trump's Ukraine Call\n\nWhistleblower Reportedly Agrees To Testify Before House Intelligence Committee\n\nLove HuffPost?
