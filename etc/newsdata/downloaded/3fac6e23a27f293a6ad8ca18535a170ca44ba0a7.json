Residential property prices in five U.S. cities examined, which include New York and San Francisco, hovered above what the study considers a fair assessment rate, but cities outside of the U.S. are at risk of real estate bubbles. In fact, \u201cindex scores have not risen in any of the US cities in our study for the first time since 2011.\u201d\n\nThe study ranked half of the cities surveyed as overpriced and at risk of a bubble, with low interest rates pushing Eurozone housing markets like Amsterdam, Frankfurt, and Paris into danger.\n\n\"On a global level, economic uncertainty is outweighing the effect of falling interest rates on urban housing demand,\u201d Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a press statement. \u201cHowever, in parts of the Eurozone, low rates have still helped to push real estate valuations into bubble risk territory.\"\n\nIt was no surprise that residential properties in New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles were all noted as overvalued.
