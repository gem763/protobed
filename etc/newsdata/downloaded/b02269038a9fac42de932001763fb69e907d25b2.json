Photo: Orlando Police Department; News6\n\nDennis Turner, a former Orlando, Florida, police officer working as a school resource officer at the Lucious and Emma Nixon Academy, a charter school in the city, was suspended over the weekend after he arrested a 6-year-old and an 8-year-old in two separate disciplinary incidents last week. On Thursday, Meralyn Kirkland received a phone call from the school saying her 6-year-old granddaughter, Kaia Rolle, had kicked a staff member and been arrested and charged with battery, she told local TV station WKMG. \u201cNo 6-year-old child should be able to tell somebody that they had handcuffs on them and they were riding in the back of a police car and taken to a juvenile center to be fingerprinted, mug shot,\u201d Kirkland said.\n\nRolle, who is black, was returned to the school without being processed, according to Orlando police chief Orlando Rol\u00f3n. Neither the name nor the gender of the 8-year-old arrested the same day has been disclosed, nor have details about the incident that led to the arrest. The Reserve Officer Program, which is composed of former Orlando police and employs Officer Turner, requires a supervisor to approve the arrest of any child under 12 years old. Turner did not seek that approval and is now being investigated. \u201cAs a grandparent of three children less than 11 years old, this is very concerning to me,\u201d Rol\u00f3n said, according to the New York Times.\n\nOfficer Turner, who is also black and was hired by Orlando PD in 1995, has at least two violent incidents on his record, both on and off duty. In 1998, he was arrested for allegedly assaulting his 7-year-old son after the child came home from school with a \u201cbad report card,\u201d according to the Orlando Sentinel. Officials found welts and bruises on the boy\u2019s arms and chest, and Turner was suspended from the department pending an investigation but the resolution of the case is unclear. He denied the charges. \u201cDon\u2019t let this stop you from disciplining your children,\u201d he said in an interview at the time. The Sentinel also reported that the department gave Turner a written reprimand in 2015 after he had Tased a suspect five times, including twice while the man lay prone on the ground. At the time, the report found, Orlando police used force during arrests more frequently than many similar-size cities, including Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Norfolk, Virginia. The city of Orlando paid out $940,000 to resolve excessive-force lawsuits and claims involving its police that year.\n\nThe misconduct of police officers in America\u2019s schools has drawn national scrutiny of late, especially in the treatment of black children. School resource officer Ben Fields was fired in 2015 after he was captured on cell-phone video throwing a black teenage girl to the ground and dragging her across a classroom in Richland County, South Carolina. A pair of Chicago police officers were similarly captured on surveillance video in April dragging a black 16-year-old girl down the stairs of her school and punching and Tasing her. The month prior, The Daily Beast outed a school resource officer in Chesterfield, Virginia, as a member of the white-nationalist organization Identity Evropa; Daniel Morley was tasked with instructing recruits on how to hide their racist views from the public by using misleading language.\n\nBlack children in kindergarten through 12th grade are more likely than their peers to be disciplined in public schools \u2014 with little regard for their share of the student body at a given school; the poverty rate among the students; whether the school is a magnet, a charter, or otherwise specialized; or what type of punishment is being applied (in-school or out-of-school suspension, referral to law enforcement, or corporal punishment). Kirkland told reporters her granddaughter was acting out last week due to sleep apnea, a medical condition that makes her nights restless and that the family is trying to resolve. Kirkland added that when Officer Turner was made aware of the child\u2019s sleep disorder, he replied, \u201cWell, I have sleep apnea, and I don\u2019t behave like that.\u201d That the behavior of an adult man and a first-grader learning how to regulate her emotions is an absurd comparison seems to escape the officer, which is especially ironic given his own alleged history of abusing his son. The incident demonstrates nevertheless that using violent law enforcement during disciplinary incidents involving black children remains a strong impulse. There\u2019s little mystery as to why the U.S. has the highest incarceration rate in the world \u2014 and a profoundly racist one, at that \u2014 given the willingness among some of its officials to treat first-graders like public-safety threats.", "description": "Dennis Turner, a former Orlando police officer working as a school resource officer in the city, has been suspended after arresting 6-year-old Kaia Rolle and an unnamed 8-year-old last week.
