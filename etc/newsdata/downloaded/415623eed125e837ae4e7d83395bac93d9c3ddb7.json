The model, Ali Tate Cutler, says she hopes her involvement will pave the way for other plus-sized models in the future.\n\nThe collection's main message is to promote \"the brand's beautiful designs on diverse, empowered women,\" according to a press release, adding that \"the line celebrates women who want to wear beautiful lingerie for themselves, every day.\"\n\nThe new collab with VS also comes after transgender model Munroe Bergdorf starred in Bluebella's 2019 lingerie campaign, Love Yourself, before publicly criticizing Victoria's Secret for its refusal to use trans models on the runway.\n\nYou might recall that in 2018, during an interview with Vogue, Ed Razek, former chief marketing officer of Victoria's Secret parent company L Brands, made controversial comments regarding transgender and plus-size models. At the time, he said didn't think the annual fashion shows should feature \"transsexuals\" because \"the show is a fantasy.\"\n\nThe company has since made attempts to re-brand itself given the public's demand for better representation.\n\nIt seems they may have found that in Cutler, who told E! how \"surreal\" the opportunity is.\n\n\"I never expected that I was going to see an image of myself on the wall next to these top supermodels that I have been looking up to since I was a little girl,\" she told the outlet. \"It feels amazing, I feel on top of the world.\"\n\n\"I feel like they are headed in the right direction and they are listening to their audience who have requested to see more women of diverse shapes and sizes,\" she continued. \"I think if they continue to head in that direction they will be on to a jackpot because that is reflective of what the average woman is in America.\"\n\nIt's important to note that Cutler is associated with Bluebella and has not been officially hired to model for Victoria's Secret. Instead, her images are part of the Victoria's Secret X Bluebella campaign, which will be featured in stores and on social media.\n\n\"Introducing #BluebellaforVS, a new collection celebrating inclusivity and strength from U.K. label @bluebella. Deeply rooted in the brand\u2019s ethos is self-love, self-acceptance and celebrating yourself for exactly who you are,\" the brand also wrote on Instagram.\n\nThe Bluebella collection is now for sale on Victoria's Secret's website.\n\nOriginally Appeared on Glamour\n\n", "description": "Meet Ali Tate Cutler.", "authors": ["Natasha Reda"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/tkD91UEtOBDzIGDzv_qNeA--~B/aD0zNjAwO3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/glamour_497/00fb1bf5166b8e93d1e2a1ae8c5ef68c", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
