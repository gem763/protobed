Yep, glue-sniffing, illiterate Charlie, a man who is at once the most depraved member of the gang and the most adorable.\n\nThroughout the show\u2019s 13-season run, Charlie has had plenty of memorable moments, many of which often see him screaming, singing, or otherwise flying into some kind of confused rage. Sure, the other characters have their parts to play \u2014 the show certainly wouldn\u2019t be the same without Dennis\u2019s sadism, Frank\u2019s selfishness, Dee\u2019s anger, or Mac\u2019s self-delusion \u2014 but Charlie is the only one who\u2019s almost (almost) likable. His high-pitched voice, consistent uniform of Vans and a green jacket, and inadvisable penchant for singing tend to elevate basically any scene.\n\nGiven that Charlie has been responsible for some of Sunny\u2019s most ridiculous and often most endearing moments, we\u2019ve rounded up just 25 of them to revisit ahead of the show\u2019s 14th season.\n\n25. RIP Charlie\n\n\u201cMac and Charlie Die: Part One\u201d (Season 4, Episode 5)\n\nWhen Mac\u2019s father is released from prison and they believe he wants revenge on them, they decide that they have to kill themselves. Realizing that that plan is a \u2026 little much, they opt to fake their deaths, so they steal Dee\u2019s credit card and car. Some good Mac moments here, too (as he gets high on poppers and insists on wearing a wedding dress), but Charlie is of course the star here: He reveals himself as a coward by, well, faking his death in the first place but also by jumping out of the car as it crashes into the wall, both great gags in their own right. Plus, the way his teeth just slip out of his gums has given us all nightmares ever since. Bonus points for the funeral video that shows the pair on a motorbike wearing cowboy hats with the words \u201cGoodbye Cruel World\u201d on them.\n\n24. Reading Dee\u2019s diary\n\n\u201cDennis and Dee\u2019s Mom Is Dead\u201d (Season 3, Episode 3)\n\nIt\u2019s rare that any of the gang have sympathy for one another, so this Charlie moment is key for that very reason. When the gang have a party at Dennis and Dee\u2019s mom\u2019s house, Charlie invites a stranger called Ernesto to come. After Charlie stumbles upon Dee\u2019s diary, he has Ernesto read it to him (naturally) and finds himself laughing at it. That is, until Ernesto tells him off for being insensitive. He says that Charlie should see himself as Dee\u2019s \u201csoul mate in pain,\u201d so he does just that. Later, as the rest of the party falls apart for the gang, Ernesto and Charlie embrace and weep on the floor in a genuinely touching moment: \u201cI can\u2019t stop crying, Ernesto!\u201d Charlie sobs.\n\n23. Going America\n\n\u201cCharlie Goes America All Over Everybody\u2019s Ass\u201d (Season 2, Episode 9)\n\nCostumes? Check. Ridiculous song? Check. Great voice? Check! \u201cCharlie Goes America All Over Everybody\u2019s Ass\u201d has all the hallmarks of a great Charlie moment, and it absolutely delivers. After deciding to put on an anti-smoking street performance with Dee, Charlie gets fully into his role, donning a denim jacket and USA flag bandana to sing a version (entirely improvised by Charlie Day) of \u201cRock, Flag and Eagle\u201d: \u201cI\u2019m gonna rise up, I\u2019m gonna kick a little ass / Gonna kick some ass in the USA!\u201d His cast is genuinely bewildered, but we\u2019re thrilled by the whole thing.\n\n22. White Trash Charlie\n\n\u201cMac and Charlie: White Trash\u201d (Season 6, Episode 5)\n\nObviously, the gang aren\u2019t high society. That\u2019s part of their charm. But that comes to a head in \u201cMac and Charlie: White Trash,\u201d when Mac and Charlie get refused entry to a members\u2019-only pool and are forced to admit that they\u2019re lower class. \u201cYou can\u2019t do backflips, you don\u2019t know karate, you\u2019re white trash!\u201d yells Charlie, and when Mac accuses Charlie of being white trash, Charlie opts to showcase the maneuverability of his denim hot pants. Charlie is best when he\u2019s got a bit of a temper, and this episode is no exception.\n\n21. Charlie rules the world\n\n\u201cCharlie Rules the World\u201d (Season 8, Episode 8)\n\nEvery time Charlie and Dee get together, chaos is guaranteed, and \u201cCharlie Rules the World\u201d is full of notable instances. The pair join up to play an online game called \u201cTechPocalypse,\u201d wherein they\u2019re married. He goes all megalomaniac with power, \u201cpsychologically annihilating\u201d Dee and buying her furs to keep her on his side \u2014 until she cheats on him in the game, leading him to scream at an entire party of people until Dennis unplugs the entire thing. This episode also sees Charlie meeting a woman in real life just to scream at her while he ruins her life in the game: \u201cI\u2019m doing good in the game so I\u2019m doing good in life!\u201d he shrieks, covered in dirt and juice after days of subsisting on \u201cenergy balls.\u201d\n\n20. Charlie\u2019s illiteracy screws the Gang\n\n\u201cThe Gang Dances Their Asses Off\u201d (Season 3, Episode 15)\n\nCharlie\u2019s illiteracy is a recurring problem for the gang, and something that makes him seem less dangerous than the others. Notable examples include his picture-filled dream book, the illiterate script of \u201cThe Nightman Cometh,\u201d his misreadings of the law, leaving cryptic messages for Frank in the vents, nonsensical scriptwriting, and attempting to leave mysterious hostage notes. Still, it reaches hilarious heights when he accidentally puts down the bar itself as the prize in a dance-off contest because he thought the word was actually \u201cpride\u201d \u2014 as in, he\u2019s proud of the bar. Cue some truly remarkable dance moves and Mac crying, \u201cYour illiteracy has screwed us again!\u201d\n\n19. Ryan Gossshling\n\n\u201cPop-Pop: The Final Solution\u201d (Season 8, Episode 3)\n\nCharlie has a \u2026 uh \u2026 questionable relationship to Nazism, as seen in \u201cThe Gang Finds a Dead Guy,\u201d wherein he wears Pop-Pop\u2019s old Nazi uniform. In \u201cPop-Pop: The Final Solution,\u201d Charlie reveals that when the gang burned all of Pop-Pop\u2019s Nazi memorabilia, he kept a painting of a German shepherd that he believes could be \u201cNazi treasure\u201d \u2026 but Frank threw it out. After visiting a dentist to track it down, Charlie gets high on laughing gas and decides that the original painting must be destroyed as it \u201ccauses madness.\u201d Dribbling through braces, Charlie also mocks Mac for believing Ryan Gosling would play him in a movie while slurring. It\u2019s really something to see.\n\n18. Genius Charlie\n\n\u201cFlowers for Charlie\u201d (Season 9, Episode 8)\n\nCharlie is a lot of things, but a genius is maybe \u2026 not one of them. In \u201cFlowers for Charlie,\u201d a \u201cFlowers for Algernon\u201d homage, Charlie is given an intelligence pill (well, a placebo) and suddenly becomes a \u201cgenius,\u201d leaving the rest of the gang to complete his \u201cCharlie work.\u201d Charlie gets paraded in front of a class to show off the effects of the placebo and his invention, which allows \u201cspiders to talk with cats.\u201d It turns out that his intelligence was not increased, but his arrogance was, leading him to believe he had learned Mandarin in two days. When all of this is revealed, Charlie seems genuinely surprised.\n\n17. Get a job!\n\n\u201cThe Gang Sells Out\u201d (Season 3, Episode 7)\n\nIn \u201cThe Gang Sells Out,\u201d the gang blames Charlie for a chain-restaurant deal falling through for Paddy\u2019s. When they try to convince him to get a job, he goes off on an eternally relatable rant for all millennial job hunters: \u201cOh, get a job? Just get a job? Why don\u2019t I strap on my job helmet and squeeze down into a job cannon and fire off into job land, where jobs grow on jobbies?!\u201d he yells, in a hilarious rant-speech with the physical comedy of him miming strapping himself into a job cannon, ready to blast all over the job market.\n\n16. Charlie Kelly, cat expert\n\n\u201cMac and Dennis Break Up\u201d (Season 5, Episode 9)\n\nCharlie loves cats, despite being perpetually harassed by them, as he insists on eating cat food and gluing cat hair to his body. In this episode, he goes to hang out with Dee after Mac moves in with him and makes things too clean. Dee has a cat stuck in her wall and Charlie breaks out that perfectly high-pitched voice to help her out with it, revealing himself as not just a cat enthusiast but an expert. \u201cCat in the wall, huh? Now you\u2019re talking my language!\u201d His solution? To put a \u201cshit ton\u201d more cats in the wall, of course.\n\n15. The glue dance\n\n\u201cHow Mac Got Fat\u201d (Season 7, Episode 10)\n\nSame deal as the one below, but with more David Lynch vibes, and a great deal more glue huffed. Eerie rather than adorable, but still very easily watchable on an endless loop again \u2026 and again \u2026 and again \u2026\n\n14. Butt dance\n\n\u201cThe Gang Gets a New Member\u201d (Season 6, Episode 8)\n\nLet\u2019s all hear it for Charlie\u2019s butt dance. Sure, this episode doesn\u2019t go so well for Charlie. But it still ranks up there as one of TV\u2019s greatest dance moves of all time, right after Elaine\u2019s \u201clittle kicks\u201d on Seinfeld. After wowing the gang with it his \u201cbutt dance,\u201d Charlie tries to impress them again after someone new threatens to replace him in the group. They aren\u2019t watching, but are impressed by Jason Sudeikis\u2019s poor, try-hard imitation. Poor Charlie. Still, this infinite loop is a great antidote.\n\n13. Gay for God\n\n\u201cThe Gang Exploits a Miracle\u201d (Season 2, Episode 7)\n\nCostumes, songs, performance \u2026 these are all classic Charlie staples. When he isn\u2019t wearing his uniform of a green jacket and Vans, he prefers to go all out with a real Capital O Outfit, as in this episode, which finds the gang discovering a stain that Mac believes is the Virgin Mary. The rest of the gang, naturally, see the stain as an opportunity to exploit. When visitors come to Paddy\u2019s, Charlie puts on an all-white suit and offers a \u201cconfession\u201d that he\u2019s in love with a man, \u201ca man called God\u201d \u2014 and adding, for emphasis, that he\u2019s gay for God \u2014 all of which annoys Mac, a foreshadowing of his confused Catholic future.\n\n12. Furious Charlie\n\n\u201cHundred Dollar Baby\u201d (Season 2, Episode 5)\n\n\n\nOne of the most notable examples of Charlie\u2019s hilarious, terrifying rage is in \u201cHundred Dollar Baby,\u201d when the gang get Charlie to into boxing matches because of his remarkable ability to take a beating. He and Dee get addicted to steroids in order to improve their fighting abilities and end up going absolutely loco. In one particularly good moment, Charlie furiously eats a sandwich, sobbing as he alternates between devastating mood swings, while his friends look on, perplexed. In another, he and Dee face off, threatening each other viciously. It\u2019s all top-notch Charlie behavior.\n\n11. The Nightman\n\n\u201cThe Nightman Cometh\u201d (Season 4, Episode 13)\n\nOf all the Sunny episodes and references that might actually be recognizable to non-fans, \u201cThe Nightman Cometh,\u201d in which Charlie writes and puts on a musical to win over the waitress, is definitely up there. \u201cThe Nightman Cometh\u201d is a perfect Charlie-centric episode for many reasons. One, he\u2019s a rage-filled director who threatens to smack everyone into little tiny pieces. Two, he\u2019s a surprisingly gifted singer, director, and producer. While his actors leave a lot to be desired, the song in which he, as the dayman, comes down on a giant yellow sun in order to direct his words at the waitress in the front row is peak Charlie, and almost an emotional number compared to \u201cboy\u2019s hole.\u201d Almost.\n\n10. Charlie\u2019s birthday\n\n\u201cCharlie Kelly: King of the Rats\u201d (Season 6, Episode 10)\n\nNobody in the Paddy\u2019s gang is by any means a \u201cgood\u201d person, but Charlie is maybe as deserving of happiness as they come. In \u201cCharlie Kelly: King of the Rats,\u201d the rest of the group wants to give him a decent birthday to cheer him up, starting with Dee\u2019s attempt to take him to a spa, much to his confusion. He apparently \u2026 doesn\u2019t know what a spa is. He\u2019s convinced that she\u2019s talking about spaghetti, so attempts to take a bag of spaghetti into the steam room: \u201cWhat\u2019s your spaghetti policy here?\u201d he asks. Still, the gang come together in the end to re-create scenes from Charlie\u2019s dream book: denim chicken, worm hat, and bird with teeth, in an actually almost heartwarming scene that has us all cheering for Charlie and his new rat-bashing stick.\n\n9. The sun block\n\n\u201cThe Gang Goes to the Jersey Shore\u201d (Season 7, Episode 2)\n\nCharlie\u2019s entire trip to the Jersey Shore is pretty adorable, from his fear of traveling to his amazement at the ocean and the joy that Europe is just across it (\u201cDo not try to swim to Europe!\u201d). He ends up having a far more magical time on the Shore than his friends, even meeting up with the waitress for a wonderful night of sea-jewel collecting, but the thing that really epitomizes the entire trip is when he tries to copy Dennis and Dee\u2019s \u201csunblock drink.\u201d Only he doesn\u2019t swap out sunblock for booze, he just gets messed up on sunblock. All in all, it\u2019s sweet, and probably the perfect \u201cOut of Office\u201d GIF.\n\n8. His online dating profile\n\n\u201cThe Waitress Is Getting Married\u201d (Season 5, Episode 5)\n\nOnline dating is hard, and it all starts with what to put on that profile. Are you honest? Do you twist the truth just a little in your favor? Well, before Charlie\u2019s disastrous date (see: No. 5) comes his online dating profile, which Mac and Dennis help out with before deciding to just lie. There are so many gems here ready to steal for your own Tinder: Favorite food? Milk steak. Hobby? Magnets. Likes? Little green ghouls. Dislikes? People\u2019s knees. With all that, and the photo to match, this might be one of Charlie\u2019s greatest \u2014 and most relatable \u2014 moments.\n\n7. Wild card, bitches!\n\n\u201cThe Gang Solves the Gas Crisis\u201d (Season 4, Episode 2)\n\nCharlie fans might call him the heart of the group, but in \u201cThe Gang Solves the Gas Crisis,\u201d the gang have other ideas. When they decide to start selling oil door to door, Charlie gives us, and one frightened woman, the first look at his Texas oil-merchant character. The gang figure out what role he plays: He\u2019s the wild card. Ever keen to prove his place in the world, Charlie cuts the brakes on Frank\u2019s van and screams, \u201cWild card, bitches! Yeehaw!\u201d before throwing himself out of the back of the van. There goes our hero, once again inserting a new quote into our collective vocabulary.\n\n6. Kitten Mittens\n\n\u201cPaddy\u2019s Pub: Home of the Original Kitten Mittens\u201d (Season 5, Episode 8)\n\nThe gang have always been adept at, well, not making money, but at coming up with schemes to at least try to make some money. With Kitten Mittens, Charlie\u2019s almost onto a winner \u2014 until a disastrous run-in with the gang\u2019s least-favorite lawyer. Still, the video commercial for the Kitten \u201cMittons\u201d is comedy gold, cut and edited just so, to make it feel as hectic and unprofessional as possible. Charlie\u2019s acting here is key, as he struggles to get out the lines he\u2019s written for himself and puts his hands over his ears dramatically. \u201cIs your cat constantly stomping around driving you crazy?\u201d Charlie shouts. \u201cIs your cat clawing at your furnitures?\u201d He\u2019s great in it, of course, but it\u2019s the animalistic sound effects that really seal the deal.\n\n5. Charlie\u2019s first date\n\n\u201cThe Waitress Is Getting Married\u201d (Season 5, Episode 5)\n\nCharlie doesn\u2019t have the easiest time with the ladies, and typically he only has himself to blame. But when he finds out the waitress is getting married, the boys decide to distract him, so they set him up on a date with a woman from a dating website. Here\u2019s where all that Charlie-ness works against him \u2014 while Mac and Dennis have lied for Charlie in order to make a good impression, he\u2019s not so good at pretending. Cue sweating, eating disastrous amounts of cheese, bleeding everywhere, and scaring the woman by calling himself a \u201cfull-on rapist\u201d rather than a \u201cphilanthropist.\u201d The moral is: Always be yourself.\n\n4. \u201cDid you fuck my mom, Santa Claus?\u201d\n\n\u201cA Very Sunny Christmas\u201d (Season 6, Episode 13)\n\nThis Christmas special really sees Charlie at his best, as he and Mac attempt to rekindle the spirit of Christmas past. It\u2019s only with age that we realize our own holiday traditions aren\u2019t quite like anyone else\u2019s, so as they delve into their pasts, they discover that while Mac\u2019s family was robbing other children of their gifts, Charlie\u2019s mom was sleeping with men dressed as Santa Claus to make money. When Charlie comes across a mall Santa, he goes into a full-blown screaming rage and bites chunks out of his neck. It\u2019s truly gory and disgusting, but seeing Charlie Day\u2019s face contorted as he spits, \u201cDid you fuck my mom, Santa Claus?\u201d really showcases his talents for playing someone no one else could.\n\n3. \u201cGo Fuck Yourself\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Gang Desperately Tries to Win an Award\u201d(Season 9, Episode 3)\n\nOne of the biggest twists in Sunny lore is that Charlie is actually good at something. Despite being unable to read or write and having few interpersonal skills, he can at least write and sing music. While \u201cThe Nightman Cometh\u201d is perhaps the most-referenced example, \u201cGo Fuck Yourself\u201d has more than earned a look-in. In a parody of other, cleaner sitcoms (like New Girl), in \u201cThe Gang Desperately Tries to Win an Award\u201d Charlie ruins their chances by being gross and crass, just like the show itself, and singing a curse-filled song while high from sniffing paint. There\u2019s a great remix of this song on YouTube, too.\n\n2. The blood capsules\n\n\u201cFrank\u2019s Pretty Woman\u201d (Season 7, episode 1)\n\n\u201cFrank\u2019s Pretty Woman\u201d is already a perfect episode, made so thanks to a stellar group effort and a brilliant (if brief) performance by Frank\u2019s sex-worker girlfriend, Roxy. Unconvinced by Roxy, Charlie wants Frank to date someone who doesn\u2019t want his money, so he pretends he\u2019s a millionaire who works in boiled denim. Charlie plans to skip out on the date so Frank, acting as chauffeur, can sweet talk her himself, but the plan goes horribly wrong. After swallowing a ton of blood capsules, Charlie ends up vomiting blood everywhere and screaming \u201cI\u2019VE BEEN POISONED BY MY CONSTITUENTS!\u201d in his full oil-baron cosplay.\n\n1. Pepe Silvia\n\n\u201cSweet Dee Has a Heart Attack\u201d (Season 4, episode 10)\n\nSo good it\u2019s become the subject of widespread memes and theories, Charlie\u2019s conspiratorial Pepe Silvia breakdown is him at his squawky best. He believes he\u2019s cracked a conspiracy at the heart of the company where he and Mac work in the mailroom, convinced that nobody he\u2019s collecting mail for actually exists. \u201cThis office is a goddamn ghost town!\u201d he yells, eyes red, a cigarette burning. While it\u2019s likely nobody actually knows what Pepe Silvia really means, most agree that the illiterate Charlie is probably misreading Pennsylvania. Brilliant.", "description": "Whoever you think the best character in It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia is, you\u2019re wrong: It\u2019s actually Charlie.
