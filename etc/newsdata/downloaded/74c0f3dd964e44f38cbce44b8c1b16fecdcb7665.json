He was found on the street, sleeping rough, and the police could not make sense of his words.\n\nAfter a brief trip to the hospital it was decided that he was \u2018mentally unwell\u2019 and now he stands in front of me, expressing with passion that unseen enemies wish him harm. It is up to me and the team to decide what to do next.\n\nSo, after hours of research on his past, talking to him and discussing his case with others, we eventually decide to detain him under the Mental Health Act. Understandably, he is furious and we quickly become the enemy, too.\n\nThis is what psychiatry can be, but not what most people understand.\n\nSometimes we need to detain those we perceive to be at risk and deprive liberty. Often the patient will understand months later \u2013 sometimes never. I will not pretend that this is easy and our decisions often replay in our minds in the early hours.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo we make mistakes? Certainly. Do they haunt us? More than you know.\n\nAt a time when people speak frankly and openly online about their experiences of failed treatments, we psychiatrists are given the opportunity to consider where we are going wrong \u2013 which I consider a blessing.\n\nThe world of psychiatry is complicated and new research is often casting aspersions on conventional wisdom, meaning we have to be adaptable to changing our long held beliefs.\n\nBut the main challenge is how to eradicate the suffering of the one in four of us who do struggle with mental ill health each year.\n\nMy own entanglements with depression have made me more attuned to how others also facing this illness might be feeling \u2013 and I certainly feel it has made me more empathetic.\n\nBut I also understand that for some, this illness feels like something to be ashamed of and can be a barrier to seeking help.\n\nUnlike most of medicine, which has enjoyed centuries of research, psychiatry has been marred by a protracted age of relative ignorance (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nThis stigma can kill \u2013 plain and simple. I have met many men who deny illness to a level of feeling suicidal and the data shows that this is a real problem.\n\nRight now rates of self-harm in the UK are the highest in Europe at 400 per 100,000 and suicide is the biggest killer of men under 45.\n\nI want these people scared of receiving help to know that psychiatrists like me aren\u2019t going to judge them. We\u2019re not here to pathologise who you are as people; we are here to help you when you are feeling unwell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I first meet a patient I have usually read as much about them and their story as possible; their psychiatry history, reviews, comments and plans, diagnoses, medical problems and everything else.\n\nMy first step \u2013 and this can be the hardest part \u2013 is to help them feel at ease. Coming into hospital can be unpleasant, and if you are under a mental health section, usually confusing of even oppressing.\n\nNext, we listen, gathering information to help put a plan together. Psychiatry is a complicated field and a diagnosis may take time to find, but we always have your best interests at heart.\n\nTreatment depends on the condition, social factors, severity of illness and much more. Sometimes it can be as simple as prescribing a medication. It can be as complex as requesting imaging of someone\u2019s brain, or as series as requiring electroconvulsive therapy (which can be life saving).\n\nThe crucial combination is to treat people as we approach illness, by looking at the biological, social and psychological factors. Illness affects all three of these domains, so to help someone, we must address them.\n\nThis could mean signposting therapy, assessing for suitable housing and support, and beginning a medication. Patients lives are not as straight forward as ticking boxes.\n\nIt can be hard today when the conversation around mental health \u2013 although much improved \u2013 is still not helpful to people in the midst of a personal crisis.\n\nWe still treat the concept of mental health problems as synonymous with moral depravity \u2013 with politicians like Donald Trump blaming mental health issues for crimes like mass shootings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf we are to ever counter this damaging narrative, it has to start from the top down and everyone must get on board with using language more responsibly.\n\nSo on World Mental Health Day and beyond, I implore you to learn more. To listen, and reconsider what mental health means to you.\n\nThe man we saw on that early morning is still undergoing treatment. It will not be an easy journey for him, but we will help him as best we can.\n\nIn the end, we are all susceptible. However, through understanding, compassion and empathy we can make the world more mental health friendly.\n\nThere needs to be a realisation that all of us can indeed suffer \u2013 and we need not do so alone.\n\nMORE: As a sexual health nurse here's what I want you to know\n\nMORE: Shopping addiction is a real disorder and shouldn't be trivialised\n\nMORE: Tories tweet that people with mental health conditions should be \u2018neutered\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Do we make mistakes?
