The most concerning of the trio is Vunipola, who was seen walking around the team hotel in a protective boot despite the England camp claiming on Monday that he was not in one.\n\nScott Wisemantel, England\u2019s attack coach, later confirmed that he is having to wear a boot as a precaution, but confirmed that he is not the only one struggling this week.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Like I said, the other guys in the 31 are tracking on pretty well. It's a nice situation to be in.\n\n\u201cToday Owen was just a bit crook in the stomach, he was a bit sick. That is the only reason that he came out later on.\n\n\u201cWe have got another player who has got an upset stomach as well, Luke Cowan-Dickie. Luke trained a wee bit, just a little bit of throwing.\u201d\n\nFarrell\u2019s condition will be closely monitored this week given that he could return to fly-half against France, should George Ford be given his first rest of the World Cup after starting all three games so far on top of the four warm-up matches.\n\nThe skipper was highly praised by head coach Eddie Jones and Wisemantel after the victory over 14-man Argentina, but he has not quite produced the type of match-defining performances since arriving in Japan that he has delivered time and time again for England, which may have a lot to do with his move to inside centre and the installation of Ford at fly-half.\n\nFarrell has also taken two brutal tackles to the head in consecutive games, which led to red cards for the USA flanker John Quill and Argentina lock Tomas Lavanini, but Wisemantel believes they have not had any effect on the Saracens back and it is merely down to a change in role in what England are asking Farrell to do, despite him missing his first four kicks at goal last Saturday.\n\n\u201cI don't think the bump had any effect on him, Wisemantel added. \u201cI asked after the game, he said he felt pretty good, just a bit clunky with a few of the plays. But I thought he did outstandingly well. The goal-kicking, it would be easy to panic and say let's change to George, but the boys changed the problem on the field and he said he was approaching the ball too square, fixed it, and away he went.\u201d\n\nAddressing the balance between Ford and Farrell, attack coach Wisemantel added: \u201cThe thing about the dynamic is Owen becomes more of a runner at 12. And then you can pull it apart and say he is not his usual self. He is more of a runner, so you are seeing a different Owen. That is what you are seeing.\n\n\u201cSo you are not seeing the distributor all the time because George fills that role. It is changing roles, that is all that it is, and George is doing exceptionally well.\u201d\n\nEngland are certain to make changes for this weekend\u2019s match though, with a decision already taken not to risk Vunipola even if he were to recover for \u2018Le Crunch\u2019 with France. Jones is expected to make widespread changes, with the likes of Joe Launchbury, Courtney Lawes, Lewis Ludlam and Mark Wilson expected to come into the pack and Willi Heinz and Henry Slade into the back line, though the final decision will be made on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThat is an ongoing process,\u201d said Wisemantel. \u201cWe had a brief selection meeting last night [Monday]. We will have another one tonight and one tomorrow. It is a process where everyone gets to debate and then what we will do is work out the best combinations and what is the best fit for this weekend against France.\n\n\u201c[Resting players] is a consideration but it is not at the forefront of our minds. The first thing is to win the game. The next game is the most important, so France is our priority. That is where our heads are at. From there we can make decisions around who might be rested, who might not.\u201d", "description": "The England\u00a0camp has been struck by injuries and sickness in the build-up to their Pool C showdown with France\u00a0at the Rugby World Cup, with Owen Farrell, Billy Vunipola and Jack Nowell among those affected.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/08/17/owen-farrell.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
