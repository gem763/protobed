(Image: Warner Bros.)\n\nBecause Todd Phillips\u2019 Joker tells the relatively grounded story of a disaffected white man who goes on a terroristic rampage because he feels as if he\u2019s been dealt a bad hand in life, there\u2019s been an ongoing discussion about whether the movie has the potential to inspire certain viewers to model themselves (idealistically) after the titular villain.\n\nEven though the Joker is objectively made out to be the villain of his own film, it\u2019d be disingenuous to say that he isn\u2019t framed in a heroic way because the story being told is about his origins and ascendance. We know that the clown is destined to become one of Gotham\u2019s most enduring threats and one of the few people capable of going toe-to-toe with Batman, and so the Joker\u2019s on-screen actions, horrific though they made be, all build toward the idea of him becoming a powerful, important figure in society.\n\nWhile the Joker movie is meant to be a critique of people like its central character, it\u2019s easy to see how it could also be interpreted as a celebration of them \u2014 but, apparently, that idea never quite occurred to Joaquin Phoenix or Warner Bros. During a recent interview for a profile in the Telegraph, Phoenix allegedly stopped the conversation dead in its tracks after being asked whether he\u2019d given any thought to the possibility that audiences might take the wrong message away from the movie.\n\nRather than stopping to mull the question over, Phoenix simply left, much in the same way he was alleged to often do while shooting the film itself:\n\n\u201cYet Phoenix doesn\u2019t seem to have considered this kind of question at all. So when I put it to him \u2013 aren\u2019t you worried that this film might perversely end up inspiring exactly the kind of people it\u2019s about, with potentially tragic results? \u2013 his fight-or-flight response kicks in. Mine too, just about. It takes an hour\u2019s peace-brokering with a Warner Bros PR to get things back on track. Phoenix panicked, he later explains, because the question genuinely hadn\u2019t crossed his mind before \u2013 then asks me, not for the last time, what an intelligent answer might have sounded like.\u201d\n\nAnd no, Phoenix never answered the question.\n\nIt seems unfathomable that Phoenix could have taken this role on without spending any time reflecting on the cultural landscape the movie exists in, given the actor\u2019s reputation for diving deep into the essence of the characters that he plays.\n\nEven if he somehow managed put together his take on the Joker in a vacuum, it seems just as unlikely that this topic never came up during the movie\u2019s production process, or that someone at Warner Bros. wouldn\u2019t have thought to themselves \u201chmm, someone\u2019s probably going to ask about the movie glorifying angry white men taking up arms.\u201d\n\nJoker \u2014 a movie few people have actually seen yet \u2014 hits theatres on October 3.", "description": "Because Todd Phillips\u2019 Joker tells the relatively grounded story of a disaffected white man who goes on a terroristic rampage because he feels as if he\u2019s been dealt a bad hand in life, there\u2019s been an ongoing discussion about whether the movie has the potential to inspire certain viewers to model themselves...", "authors": ["Robb Holland", "Charles Pulliam-Moore"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/yrq9gzbz30hbatomueu2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
