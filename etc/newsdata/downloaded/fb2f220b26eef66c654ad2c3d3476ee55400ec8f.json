High-waisted cuts were once considered dowdy and drab, but today they are almost certainly the most sought-after.\n\nTheir resurgence can be credited to the fashion pack\u2019s ever-increasing obsession with all things 1990s, when stiff, stonewashed high-waisted jeans were a key wardrobe staple. Back then, they were paired with loose-fitting plaid shirts (see Monica Geller in Friends) or colourful crop tops. Now, you\u2019re more likely to see them worn with with tight-fitting bodies or oversized boyfriend shirts.\n\nHowever you wear your pair, finding the right high-waisted jeans for you can be tricky. The main priorities are to find a pair that hugs your waist and your glutes without being too tight on the legs. It\u2019s harder than it sounds, given we all have different body shapes that might not correspond with the proportions laid out for us by brands.\n\nHence why many women only buy their jeans from one brand in particular, one they know accommodates their shape. Here, we round up our picks of the best high waisted jeans to suit all tastes and sizes.\n\nSome are classic and straight-leg \u2013 a staple for those seeking a retro look - while others are colourful and flared, which can be good for those looking for more of a statement piece.

The cult Los Angeles label takes its inspiration from 1970s style icons like Bianca Jagger and Stevie Nicks. These are so comfortable you\u2019ll almost want to sleep in them. The denim is soft but stiff, offering a strong silhouette that draws attention to the waist. It\u2019s flattering on the bum too but doesn\u2019t tighten when you sit down. These jeans are best suited to classic Nineties ensembles, so pair them with white T-shirts or sleeveless band tees. As for shoes, roll the bottoms up and wear them over your favourite pair of bovver boots \u2013 Dr Martens are always a winner.\n\nBuy now\n\nPaige Nellie culotte: \u00a3236.99, Paige\n\nThese jeans are great for when you don\u2019t actually feel like wearing jeans. The legs are wide and airy, the light denim is malleable and the waist is high but not too tight. It\u2019s not a brilliant option for those who like to stash personal goods in their pockets (the front two are more of a fashion statement than a practical one), but these jeans are nonetheless a fun and feminine choice for those looking for something stylish but comfortable from a highly rated denim brand. Yes, they\u2019re expensive. But Paige\u2019s jeans stand the test of time and can weather even the most aggressive of washes. You\u2019ll see.\n\nBuy now\n\nBDG dillon '90s blue slim straight jeans: \u00a350, Urban Outfitters\n\nThese are the ultimate jeans for Nineties kids, or wannabe ones. This particular wash of denim \u2013 rusty blue \u2013 is very Monica Geller, as is the cut: stiff and straight, but hugs the bottom. This pair is a bit tighter than the classic mom jean style that has become increasingly popular in recent years, making it even more flattering. We suggest pairing these with your best retro crop top and a pair of chunky trainers.\n\nBuy now\n\nLevi\u2019s 501 crop jeans: \u00a395, Levi\u2019s\n\nLevi\u2019s is world-renowned for being a hero of denim. And for good reason. The brand\u2019s most famous pair? The 501s, loved for their flattering fit and vintage feel. This cropped iteration allows you to wear them with some biker boots or indeed to play around with your choice of socks, which you can hoist up high above your trainers or brogues for more of a style punch. They come up rather big, so we\u2019d suggest going down a size if you\u2019re seeking a tighter fit.\n\nBuy now\n\n7 for all Mankind high waist vintage cropped boot snakeskin: \u00a3280, 7 for all Mankind\n\nThese snakeskin kick flare jeans are not for the faint-hearted. The cream and dark brown print is vibrant and heralds attention, so we\u2019d suggest wearing them with a simple oversized jumper or T-shirt \u2013 choose monochrome if possible. The stretch-cotton fabric is comfortable but tighter than the other styles mentioned here, so expect a more fitted look. The bootcut style works perfectly with pointed heeled boots or sandals (trainers don\u2019t really work here) and is particularly great at elongating your legs.\n\nBuy now\n\n& Other Stories high waisted cotton twill trousers: \u00a359, & Other Stories\n\nThese are the kind of jeans your art teacher might\u2019ve worn. The vintage wash and tapered leg screams creativity, while the contrast hip stripe highlights your curves. The pockets are generously sized too \u2013 plenty of room to stash any paintbrushes or pencils. The legs are particularly wide, so this is not a good choice for people who want a more structured fit. Given how loose the legs are, a tighter top is advised for contrast \u2013 perhaps a bodysuit or a long-sleeved T-shirt that you tuck in. Shoe-wise, go for some sporty trainers, the chunkier the better.\n\nBuy now\n\nRag & Bone Ruth super high-rise straight: \u00a3250, Rag & Bone\n\nThis edgy New York brand is known for its jeans, many of which stick to the classic straight-leg style. These are a little wider than the usual offering, giving a bit of a skater chick vibe. The dark indigo shade is retro-inspired and the denim itself is made from Japanese materials. The zip fly cinches in your waist without digging into you. The pockets are roomy too, with plenty of space to store your smartphone or keys. These are a good choice for everyday casual wear. We suggest pairing with a striped breton long-sleeved top.\n\nBuy now\n\nAcne peg high-rise skinny jeans: \u00a3170, Net-A-Porter\n\nSkinny jeans aren\u2019t quite the popular staple they once were, hence why there\u2019s only one pair included in this list. That said, they do still have a place in this world, particularly if they\u2019re from ultimate Swedish cool-girl brand: Acne. This stretchy black pair will go with just about any item in your wardrobe and the soft denim will flatter your figure, whatever shape it may be. We suggest wearing these with an oversized black leather jacket and boots \u2013 it\u2019s what all of the Swedes do, and goodness knows they\u2019re a well-dressed bunch.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: High-waisted jeans\n\nThere are some notable pairs in this roundup, namely from Levi\u2019s and Paige, but Frame\u2019s offering comes out on top thanks to the quality of its denim paired with the flattering fit and comfort levels. They\u2019re not cheap, but good jeans are worth investing in because they\u2019ll last for years. And chances are that this classic straight-leg style isn\u2019t falling off the trend circuit any time soon.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
