Why does it feel so hard to hang them?", "language": "en", "text": "Without question, we are living in a photo-saturated world. Most of us have access to thousands of images on devices we carry with us everywhere. Mariam Naficy, founder and chief executive of Minted design marketplace, says pictures have become a form of social currency. \u201cPosing for them, taking them and sharing them have become how we communicate with friends and family.\u201d\n\nSo you have to wonder, if we\u2019re already inundated with photos of our kids and dogs, do we need to have images of them hanging in our homes, too?\n\nFor many of us, the answer is still yes, but we\u2019re not using family photos in the way we used to.\n\n\u201cMy clients want their family photos to have a visual impact and not be scattered throughout the house in random frames,\u201d New York interior designer Ashley Whittaker says. She prefers to consolidate her clients\u2019 photos in a private space in their homes and hang them in a gallery-like fashion.\n\nNew York interior designer Todd Klein agrees that family photos should stay in a home\u2019s private spaces \u2014 the master bedroom, the dressing room, the mudroom \u2014 for three reasons. One: You probably spend more time in the private spaces of your home, so you interact with the images more frequently. Two: Most family photographs need to be viewed very closely because they are small and intimate. \u201cHang small photos over a big sofa,\u201d Klein says, \u201cand they will get lost.\u201d And three: By hanging photos in a gallery configuration, you can create an interesting arrangement with a bigger presence, like an art installation.\n\n[There are many ways to design a gallery wall. We\u2019ll get you started.]\n\nWith thousands of images on our phones, it is hard to zero in on the few images of family and friends that are frame-worthy, not to mention wall-worthy.\n\nSo how do you narrow them down? Tessa Wolf, creative director of the online framing company Framebridge, says to start by doing a quick scroll through your camera roll. \u201cDon\u2019t spend more than five minutes doing it,\u201d she says. \u201cSee what photos immediately pop out to you and mark them as favorites as you go; that way you can easily find them in an album.\u201d If you use a photo editing app, Wolf says to look first at the photos you\u2019ve already chosen to edit; they were probably the best ones when you took them. Choosing from those preselected favorites will prove much more manageable.\n\nOr you can hire a professional to help. As part of her decorating services, Whittaker helps her clients curate their family photos. She and her team select, crop and edit the images. She always makes sure every family member is equally represented in the mix.\n\nOnce you select your favorite photos, you want to take into account the size and scale of the images. If all your images are similar in style or tone (for example, they\u2019re all from the same photo shoot or taken on the same day), choose a mix of close-up and distant images to add visual interest. Also, Wolf says to mix the size of the photos; this gives the final arrangement a more organic feel.\n\nIf you are going for a more varied look, Wolf says to mix black and white photos and color photos together on a wall. \u201cJust be sure to have a nice mix of the two throughout the gallery wall so it looks balanced.\u201d And she adds: \u201cYou can easily convert a color photo to black and white on your phone, in Instagram, or using pretty much any photo editor like VSCO.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to printing images, most online sites will automatically check the image\u2019s resolution and then suggest the largest size at which you can print it without compromising the quality. Wolf says many phone photos can be printed larger than you would think. \u201cA photo from a new iPhone can be blown up to about 22 by 30, which is huge.\u201d\n\nFor framing, Naficy, Whittaker, Klein and Wolf agree that frames don\u2019t have to match, but choosing frames with a similar hue will create a more unified look. For example, Wolf suggests mixing white and silver or natural wood frames \u2014 using different widths and textures \u2014 but all in similar color and tone.\n\nBoth Whittaker and Klein also like to incorporate family keepsakes into their clients\u2019 gallery walls. \u201cOur goal is to create arrangements for our clients that feel special and, most of all, personal,\u201d Whittaker says. Klein likes to think of these arrangements as scrapbooks of a family\u2019s life; he includes framed diplomas, invitations, ticket stubs \u2014 as he says, \u201call the different things that people save because they mean something.\u201d Though incorporating other items into your gallery wall display is more interesting, it can also be more challenging to hang. Naficy says to look for similar hues, shapes, textures and patterns and group them together for a more cohesive display.\n\nWhen creating a gallery wall, Wolf says, you don\u2019t want the outer edges of your arrangement to be square; you want them to be imperfect so you can add new pieces as you get them. She advises keeping two inches between each piece so that the arrangement looks intentional and maintains a degree of consistency no matter how big it gets. If you have less space between the pieces, Wolf says you will have trouble controlling the arrangement; more space and it will look like you didn\u2019t plan to hang the pieces together.\n\nAnd whatever you do, Kline says, \u201chang each picture using two hooks, so the frames don\u2019t move around.\u201d\n\nMayhew, a \u201cToday\u201d show style expert and former magazine editor, is the author of \u201cFlip! for Decorating.\u201d", "description": "Experts offer their advice for selecting the best images to create an intimate installation.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Mayhew", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/9dVbpamVQAEUVYeU5-eE6fgNcHc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NAL3QFGVREI6TFQQ7NLMKURODQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
