We see clear risks that they continue to grind towards new cycle lows.\n\nThe upside risk would be an immediate resolution to US-China trade frictions.\n\n\"While there is room for fiscal manoeuvring, hedging costs and loss of yield advantage to the USD will likely continue to starve these currencies - NZD especially - of foreign capital flows,\" Mr Issa said in a note.\n\nTD sees the Australian dollar at US69\u00a2, and the Kiwi at US63\u00a2. At about 6.30am AEDT on Thursday, the Aussie was trading at US67.26\u00a2 and the Kiwi at US62.91\u00a2.\n\n\"The upside risk would be an immediate resolution to US-China trade frictions. While we think the less supportive macro environment may increase the need for domestic political wins near-term and a delay in the implementation of tariffs this year, a full comprehensive deal remains unlikely.\"\n\nMr Issa said the Australian dollar, in particular, \"remains highly sensitive to Chinese dynamics. The most obvious is the renminbi\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Even though we took profit on our long USDCNH trade, we continue to expect this pair to remain elevated near 7.20 for now (though we see this higher next year).\"\n\nWith China representing Australia's largest market for trade, Mr Issa noted, it is no surprise to find the AUD very much sensitive to these regional equity bourses and CNH reval dynamics.\n\n\"Tactically, we think a lot of bad news is in the price for both currencies. Our HFFV estimate suggests that AUD and NZD have the most ground to make up against the USD in the very short-term. Technical studies suggest that both currencies look fatigued at current (low) levels. A fresh catalyst is needed to trigger that valuation closure - this is not immediately obvious.\"\n\nRelative data surprise momentum has begun to move in favour of NZ however, and Mr Issa said that \"suggests that AUDNZD has some room to grind lower. We think a move towards 1.05 would be a good reassessment point to fade\".", "description": "TD Securities said its expectation for these two currencies to flat line over the next six month could be too optimistic.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_37/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/9283ed6b9dfadc75a7e6464b3ca0cacaadfb9cc0", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
