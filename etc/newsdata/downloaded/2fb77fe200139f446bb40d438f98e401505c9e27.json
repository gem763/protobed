The group's stores and concessions have experienced a reduction in footfall during the period against the prior year, resulting in weaker than initially anticipated sales,\" the 26- year old fashion brand said.\n\nBritish retailers endured their worst September since at least the mid-1990s, according to recent surveys that painted a muted picture of household demand ahead of Brexit.\n\nThe company's sales fell to 63.3 million pounds ($78.88 million) in the six months ended Sept. 30 from 66.7 million pounds in the year ago period, dented by a 11% drop in Quiz's standalone stores and concessions in the United Kingdom.\n\nHowever, the company said the rate of sales declines in its 73 UK stores has reduced in recent weeks.\n\nWhile trading conditions are expected to remain challenging in the short term, Quiz's said its shifting focus to online sales can return the company to sustainable profitable growth in the medium term.\n\nPre-market indications showed Quiz's shares down 5%.
