He said his administration \u201cwill begin the search for another site, including the possibility of Camp David, immediately.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulavey, held a press conference Thursday announcing the choice of Doral for the summit. He insisted his staff had concluded it was \u201cfar and away the best physical facility.\u201d Mulvaney said the White House reached that determination after visiting 10 sites across the country.\n\nTrump had been the first administration official to publicly float the selection of his property to host the summit when in August he mentioned it was on the short-list and praised its facilities and proximity to Miami\u2019s international airport. His comments, more than a month before the official announcement, drew instant criticism from good governance groups and Democrats, who said it raised concerns that Trump was using the White House to boost his personal finances\n\nThe vociferous criticism did not die down, even as Trump insisted he would host the summit at cost, though he refused to disclose financial details. The annual heads-of-state gathering would at minimum have provided good-will value to his property.\n\nAn hour before Trump\u2019s announcement, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden condemned the selection of Doral for the summit. \u201cHosting the G7 at Trump\u2019s hotel? A president should never be able to use the office for personal gain,\u201d the former vice president.\n\nOn Thursday, Mulvaney had discounted Camp David, the government-owned presidential retreat, as the site for the summit, claiming, \u201cI understand the folks who participated in it hated it and thought it was a miserable place to have the G-7.\u201d He added that it was too small and remote for the international summit.\n\nMulvaney said then that unspecified sites in Hawaii and Utah had also been on the short list. It was unclear if they were still under consideration.", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump on Saturday abruptly reversed his plan to hold the next Group of Seven world leaders' meeting at his Doral,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/19/eb7e54_trump-doral-16964-2017-file-image-video-shows-trump-national-doral-in-doral-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
