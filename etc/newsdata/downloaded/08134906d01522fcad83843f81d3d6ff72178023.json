He's also a winemaker, someone who alternates between extreme independence and the incarnation of great Hollywood adventures.\n\n\"We live in a time when the person who made the three Godfathers, and Apocalypse Now, and so many other movies, can come and be here with us, to receive the Lumi\u00e8re Award.\"\n\nIn keeping with the award's tradition, Coppola was invited to take the director's chair in a remake of the first motion picture ever made.\n\nThe Lumi\u00e8re brothers' first film La Sortie de l'Usine Lumi\u00e8re \u00e0 Lyon (\"Workers Leaving the Lumi\u00e8re Factory in Lyon\") was shot in the city in 1895, and Coppola was at the helm for a recreation from 2019.\n\nHe also unveiled a plaque in his name on the Wall of Filmmakers, at the Lumi\u00e8re Institute.\n\nThe festival has become a success in recent years, with over 100,000 spectators and 180 classic films to see this time around.\n\nAnother attraction was Ken Loach, who drew a large crowd for one of several masterclasses that let the public question filmmakers.\n\nHis event contained a political debate about Brexit, but the British director tried to emphasise the importance of cinema too.\n\nHe also showed his new film \"Sorry We Missed You\", which tells the story of a family whose life is turned upside down when the father takes a job at a home delivery company \u2014 which strangely resembles Amazon.\n\nFrench actor and director Daniel Auteuil, whose career spanning nearly half a century covers almost a hundred films to his name, was also honoured.\n\nBut the festival made a point of including his latest film Belle Epoque, which premiered in Cannes last May and is released in France in November, in the tributes \u2014 something the director said he appreciated.\n\nAuteuil told Euronews: \"I think that a tribute that would have focused only on the past would be very beautiful but it would have made me sad. But here we had a tribute given to me in the present, as my career continues, which is something that I find is encouraging to me.\"\n\nAlso in attendance at film festival events were the American actor Frances McDormand, Canada's Donald Sutherland and the Mexican actor-director Gael Garcia Bernal.\n\nAnother star draw was Bong Joon-Ho, the Korean filmmaker who most recently claimed the Palme d'Or for his film Parasite.", "description": "The US filmmaker is honoured at a ceremony in Lyon and takes the director's chair to remake an 1895 classic", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/library/111/475/06/11149b5a0c105bf2d47516cbf0a0689a59eb572cbde6/1000x563_cmsv2_2615347c-06cb-57d9-be74-e90cb4ac432d-11149b5a0c105bf2d47516cbf0a0689a59eb572cbde6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
