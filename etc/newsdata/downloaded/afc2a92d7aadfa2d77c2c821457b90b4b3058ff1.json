It\u2019s almost as though Instagram recognized the feature was only used by people to creep on each other.\n\nBuzzfeed today reported the company was killing off the feature, trimming the Activity page so that it only shows actions as they relate to you. The feature\u2019s been in testing for a few weeks now, but now it\u2019ll roll out to everyone. In case you don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about, this was that one tab on the same page where the likes on your pics were collected, the one that showed you what the people you followed were liking and commenting on.\n\nAs nice as it is to think Instagram cut the Following because they recognized that it was kinda TMI and had gotten one too many people in trouble, the reality is far more prosaic. Vishal Shah, IG\u2019s head of product, told Buzzfeed the feature wasn\u2019t much used, and its existence was so easy to forget it took users by surprise: \u201cPeople didn\u2019t always know that their activity is surfacing. So you have a case where it\u2019s not serving the use case you built it for, but it\u2019s also causing people to be surprised when their activity is showing up.\u201d\n\nUnless you\u2019re spying on someone, I struggle to see what use case supports seeing what all your friends are liking. It\u2019s annoying enough when my Twitter feed gets taken over by tweets from people I\u2019m not following just because someone I am following liked them. No offense to the corporate brands I follow, but I don\u2019t think I could possibly care less to see what new influencer-of-the-moment they might be following or what congratulatory comments on their own posts they\u2019re liking.\n\nLast week, Instagram also introduced the Restrict feature, which allows users to put someone who follows them into a kind of echo chamber. When you restrict someone, their comments on your pictures will only be available to them. Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram, told NPR that teenagers, a large part of Instagram\u2019s core demographic, often demurred from outright blocking bullies. As users can tell when they\u2019re blocked, it might cause an offline confrontation with the bully in question. With Restrict, the bully won\u2019t perceive a change, but the bullied user and others won\u2019t have to look at or respond to their comments.\n\nAll in all, it appears Instagram\u2019s trying to redirect users from spending too much time creeping on and bothering each other and more time checking out new stuff. That\u2019s good both for users who might appreciate a little privacy and for the aforementioned corporate brands who\u2019re probably hoping to push everyone to do more shopping.\n\nThe Following tab will disappear for everyone this week.", "description": "", "authors": ["Rachel Kaser"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2017%2F04%2Finstagram-logo.png&signature=74b12de222386d7415a8620ce9115fda", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
