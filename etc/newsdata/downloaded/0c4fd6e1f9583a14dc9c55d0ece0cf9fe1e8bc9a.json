Here are its best lessons for journalists.", "language": "en", "text": "\"She Said,\" a new book by Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor, covers their New York Times investigation into Harvey Weinstein and the mountain of sexual abuse allegations against him.\n\nIt's the best book about journalism I've ever read.\n\nThe book is a masterclass in showing how to find sources and then convincing them to speak on the record.\n\nKantor and Twohey's most effective strategies involve showing their reporting track record, walking sources through how their interviews may change the future, and being tactical with the information they already had.\n\nTo move the narrative forward, the pair concentrated on wrongdoing they could most easily prove, and reported on documents instead of getting bogged down in the \"he said/she said\" conflicts in the story.\n\nSee Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nEditor's note: Last week, after I finished \"She Said,\" Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey's book about their Weinstein investigation for the New York Times, I sent a memo to the Insider newsroom. This is what it said.\n\nTeam!\n\nI finished \"She Said,\" Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey's book about their Weinstein investigation for the New York Times.\n\nIt is among the best non-fiction fiction books I have ever read.\n\nIt is without a doubt the best book about journalism I have ever read. I heartily recommend reading it if you are a reporter, editor, or someone who wants to understand what a great reporter or editor does.\n\nThe main lesson from the book is that it is hard to find sources who know the story, 10X harder to get them to tell you their story off the record, and 1,000X harder to persuade those sources to let you share their story on the record.\n\nHere are some tactics that will help:\n\nSend an introduction email that highlights the work you've done in the past. In fall 2016, Rose McGowan tweeted about a producer who assaulted her. Kantor reached out to persuade her to talk. McGowan said no, because the Times had treated her poorly in the past. Kantor emailed the following:\n\nHere's my own track record on these issues: Amazon, Starbucks, and Harvard Business School have all changed their policies in response to gender-related problems I exposed. When I wrote about the class gap in breastfeeding\u2014white collar women can pump on the job, lower paid women cannot\u2014readers responded by creating the first-ever mobile lactation suites, now available in 200+ locations across the country. If you'd rather not speak, I understand, and best of luck with your book publication. Thank you, Jodi\n\nThis email worked, and McGowan got on the phone with Kantor. I think it worked because it showed Kantor had done this kind of work before, was into the work for reasons that would appeal to McGowan (impact, not fame), and showed McGowan that if she participated it could be for the world's benefit. I also love this line: \"If you'd rather not speak, I understand, and best of luck with your book publication.\"\n\nHarvey Weinstein entering court in 2018. Mark Lennihan/AP\n\nTo get past he said/she said, report on the documents. Prior to 2016, one problem with reporting on sexual assault was that it usually boiled down to one person making an accusation against another, with few corroborating witnesses. (This is also why it's so hard to prosecute sexual assault or adjudicate it on college campuses.) Twohey and Kantor say they benefitted from a reporting innovation by their Times colleagues Emily Steele and Michael Schmidt, who brought down Bill O'Reilly. The trick was reporting on the settlements Fox News and O'Reilly paid, rather than merely the actual instances of assault or harassment. While assault happens behind closed doors, many people are aware of settlements paid by a company to a person. This is advantageous to reporters because 1) All of those people are potential sources. 2) The existence of a document is a black and white reportable fact 3) a source who can show you a document or confirm a document's existence does not need to be named the way an accuser needs to be named. So while what you think you want is a story about a particular activity, what you may need to actually chase is the document trail created by the activity within an institution.\n\nHave a specific line of inquiry. Twohey and Kantor weren't just asking \"is Weinstein a bad person who does bad things?\" They were asking: has he ever mistreated women and paid out settlements.\n\nJodi Kantor at Ignition. Roy Rochlin/Getty Images\n\nConcentrate first on wrongdoings you can most easily prove, rather than the most serious wrong-doings. At an early point in their investigation, Twohey and Kantor were inundated with stories of wrongdoing by Weinstein. Rebecca Corbett, their editor at the Times told them to prioritize those that were most easily proven, rather than those that were the most serious wrong-doing. Corbett theory, which proved true, was that one rock-solid story about wrongdoing would loosen up sources for the more serious crimes. The lesson here applies to all kinds of stories: Focus on what you can lock in first. Publish it. And more sources will speak.\n\nUse this line to persuade sources to talk. Discovering people who had been assaulted by Weinstein, and even getting them to share their stories was easy \u2013 compared with getting those people to agree to go on the record. Twohey shared with Kantor a very effective line she'd developed reporting on sexual assault against blue-collar workers in the past: \"I can't change what happened to you in the past, but together we may be able to use your experience to help protect other people.\" It worked several times.\n\nJodi Kantor and Megan Twohey attend the Time 100 Gala in 2018. Evan Agostini/Invision/AP\n\nUse this line to persuade sources not to listen to advisors telling them not to talk. Oftentimes, sources want to talk to a reporter, but they have advisors \u2013 usually cautious lawyers, but sometimes also family and friends \u2013 who tell them not too. Kantor encountered this with one source, and used this line:\n\n\"I know I must have thrown you a curveball into your trip home. But please know it's only because this story is so important. There's a real opportunity to make a difference. My hope is that we can continue to be in touch\u2014that I can keep you abreast of what's happening on our end. I suspect you've had some more conversations about this\u2014with family and perhaps others. Seems to me the most important conversation of all is the one you have with yourself.\"\n\nPaint a picture for sources to show what will happen if they go on the record. To persuade sources to go on the record, Kantor would sometimes ask them to \"imagine what it would be like to go on the record.\" \"She sketched out the growing scale of the allegations, without using names; told Madden that her story would mean a great deal to others; and promised to go over everything before publication and do whatever she could to make the experience as dignified as possible.\"\n\nThe New York Times decided to pursue the Weinstein investigation after reporting on Roger Ailes. Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images\n\nPartnering up on stories works. Over and again we see other publications having huge success publishing investigations with multiple bylines. We're also seeing more of this ourselves (look to Julie Bort and Meghan Morris's WeWork story for an example.) This book shows why. It helps with resolve, strategy, creativity, motivation, and grit. It also multiplies time and resources.\n\nAn investigation can start with a very basic observation about what's wrong with the world. The New York Times decided to pursue the Weinstein investigation after women came forward and against Roger Ailes and Donald Trump. That news reminded editors: Women are often mistreated in the workplace. This basic observation with what's wrong with the world let them to ask: How can we document that? Editors and reporters asked around. One activist told Kantor: Consider Hollywood. So she did.\n\nAshley Judd and Harvey Weinstein. Cindy Ord and Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nImpact in journalism comes from specificity. Names, dates, details. Ashley Judd was the first actor to go on the record against Harvey Weinstein, and was, in many ways Twohey and Kantor's most important source. But her disclosure to the Times wasn't the first time she'd attempted to out Weinstein. In 2015, she'd given an interview about his assault on her and others to Variety \u2013 only she left out Weinstein's name and several other details. The story was ignored by everyone except for a company that used Judd as a celebrity endorser. Twohey and Kantor write: \"Judd's account in Variety had been gutsy, but it was a lone account without a perpetrator's name or any supporting information. Impact in journalism came from specificity \u2014 names, dates, proof, and patterns.\"\n\nBe very careful, but talking to the representative of the subject you are investigating can be very effective. Dean Baquet, the executive editor of the Times, did not want Kantor or Twohey to talk to Weinstein or any of his representatives on background or off the record. Banquet believed that would just allow them to lie without repercussions. And there is wisdom to this. But when Weinstein's crisis PR rep, Lanny Davis, pushed for an on-background meeting with the reporters, Twohey thought it was a good idea. She believed she could offer up very little information to Davis, and he might accidentally confirm lots of details \u2014 or even give her new ones. She was right. Davis came into the Times, and the reporters told him they were looking into Weinstein's behavior toward women. That's it. Almost immediately Davis confirmed that Weinstein had a problem and that he had paid settlements. It was a jackpot. So, if you can trust yourself not to give away your game, it can be smart to meet with someone and see if they'll say more than they should.\n\nTop New York Times editor Dean Baquet. Charles Sykes/Invision/AP\n\nStudy this email thread. Irwin Reiter, the CFO of The Weinstein Company, ended up a key source in the investigation. Here is the email thread that reeled him in.\n\nFriday, Sep. 15, 2017, 4:46 PM To: Irwin Reiter From: Jodi Kantor Dear Irwin, Thanks for the email address. We're documenting allegations that have to do with a pattern of mistreatment of women over the years. Our reporting is turning up evidence of numerous settlements. I've been told that this is something you may have been concerned about over time. Helping us get this story right could provide an opportunity to do something about the situation, without anyone else knowing. I'd value the chance to have a confidential conversation with you, and run our information by you to see if it's right. My sister lives near you, and I was planning on being in New Jersey soon. Can I buy you a cup of coffee, just so you can suss this out more? Friday, Sep. 15, 2017, 8:27 PM To: Jodi Kantor From: Irwin Reiter Your background is impressive. In 2017, things being what they are, I have a healthy respect for reporters. Have a great weekend. Friday, Sep. 15, 2017, 9:11 PM To: Irwin Reiter From: Jodi Kantor Thank you, that means a lot to me. Carefully documenting the truth seems more important than ever. I can swing by your place around 11 a.m. on Monday to introduce myself. (The phone book says 3 Hebron Drive in East Windsor.) Let me know if there's a better day or time. Friday, Sep. 15, 2017, 9:46 PM To: Jodi Kantor From: Irwin Reiter You're a great reporter but you really stink at addresses. I've never in my life lived in New Jersey. I'm thinking about all of this. I will let you know on Monday what I've decided.\n\nConcluding the anecdote, Kantor and Twohey write, \"To keep the dialogue over email going, Jodi made small talk, with Megan invisibly reading his responses and advising on Jodi's replies. Soon Reiter sent instructions: Meet me at 9:30 p.m. at the bar behind the restaurant Little Park in Tribeca.\"\n\nLawyer David Boies, who tried to crush journalists investigating Weinstein's alleged misconduct. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly\n\nBe totally buttoned up so you can be fearless. After the Times briefed Weinstein on their first story, Weinstein's lawyer sent a terrifying letter threatening suit.\n\nIt read, in part:\n\n\"Please be advised that you are under a legal duty to maintain, preserve, protect, and not destroy any and all documents, communications, materials and data, in digital, electronic and hard copy form, that may be relevant to the dispute including without limitation all documents, materials and data that refer or relate to Harvey Weinstein, The Weinstein Company and/or any of its executives, employees and/or contractors (collectively, \"TWC\").\"\n\nBecause their reporting was rock solid, and because the USA has strong free speech laws, the Times's lawyer was not worried. \"When the facts protect us, and the law protects us, it's hard to argue with our legal position,\"\n\nHe wrote back:\n\n\"I note your document preservation demands. In light of that, please provide me with assurances that you have taken immediate steps to secure all data and records that may be relevant to this matter, whether in the possession, custody, and control of Mr. Weinstein or one of his business entities. In particular, I ask that you immediately secure all phone, email and text records of Mr. Davis, Mr. Weinstein's press representative, as well as the personal and business phone, email and text accounts of Mr. Weinstein; all records pertaining to any complaints of improper workplace behavior, whether in the possession, custody and control of Mr. Weinstein or one of his business entities; and all records relating to settlements with employees, whether in the possession, custody and control of Mr. Weinstein or one of his business entities.\"\n\nKantor and Twohey write, \"Translated from legalese, this meant: Harvey Weinstein, if you want to drag this story into open court, go right ahead.\"\n\nThat must have felt good.", "description": "\"She Said\" by Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor covers the New York Times investigation into Harvey Weinstein and the sexual abuse allegations against him.", "authors": ["Nicholas Carlson"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9b805be94e864110757571?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
