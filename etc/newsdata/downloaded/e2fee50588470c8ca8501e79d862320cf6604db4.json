Banks and shops in the busy Central district closed early in anticipation of violence as some protesters burned Chinese flags and chanted \u201cYou burn with us\u201d, and \u201cHong Kongers, revolt\u201d.\n\nThousands of demonstrators gathered in other parts of the territory, filling shopping malls and blocking roads as protests looked set to continue into the night. Bus routes were suspended and rail operator MTR closed stations.\n\n\u201cThe anti-mask law has become a tool of tyranny,\u201d said Samuel Yeung, an 18-year-old university student, as crowds swelled in Central.\n\n\u201cThey can make use of the emergency law to enact any policies or laws that the government wants. There\u2019s no rule of law anymore. We can only be united and protest.\u201d\n\n\u201cNOT A STATE OF EMERGENCY\u201d\n\nMany protesters wear masks to hide their identity due to fears employers could face pressure to take action against them.\n\n\u201cAlmost all protesters wear masks, with the intention of hiding their identity. That\u2019s why they have become more unbridled,\u201d said Lam.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t keep the existing regulations idle and let violence escalate and the situation continue to deteriorate.\u201d\n\nLam described the territory as being in serious danger, but not in a state of emergency.\n\nPro-Beijing groups had been pushing for a mask ban but it was not clear how the government would implement it in a city where many of its 7.4 million residents wear them every day to protect against infection following the outbreak of the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003.\n\nPolice can stop anyone in public and ask them to remove a mask if the officer believes it may prevent identification, according to the law. Exceptions are made if the person wearing a mask can prove they need it for medical, religious or professional reasons.\n\nOffenders face a maximum fine of HK$25,000 ($3,200) and imprisonment for a year, according to details of the prohibition published by the government.\n\nFour months of anti-government protests have plunged Hong Kong into its biggest political crisis since its handover from Britain to Beijing in 1997 under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula granting it autonomy.\n\nWhat began as opposition to a proposed extradition law, that could have seen people sent for trial in mainland courts, has grown into a broad pro-democracy movement and a serious challenge to Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\n\nHong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam attends a news conference to discuss sweeping emergency laws at government office in Hong Kong, China October 4, 2019. REUTERS/Athit Perawongmetha\n\n\u2018THINK TWICE\u2019\n\nAuthorities had already loosened guidelines on the use of force by police, according to documents seen by Reuters, but the emergency powers could backfire, some analysts fear.\n\n\u201cThis is the next significant miscalculation,\u201d said Phill Hynes, head of political risk and analysis at ISS Risk, shortly before the widely expected introduction of the emergency laws.\n\n\u201cThe next will be barring certain candidates from running in District Council elections. Both will nicely inflame tensions and increase protests and actions.\u201d\n\nPro-democracy campaigners condemned Lam\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cThis is an ancient, colonial set of regulations, and you don\u2019t use them unless you can\u2019t legislate anymore,\u201d said Martin Lee, a veteran activist and one of the city\u2019s most prominent lawyers. \u201cOnce you start, there\u2019s no end to it.\u201d\n\nThe U.N. human rights office said Hong Kong must protect the right to freedom of assembly and Britain urged its former colony not to aggravate tension.\n\nSome Hong Kong\u2019s businesses, struggling with a dip in tourism and retail sales due to the protests, gave the law a warmer welcome.\n\n\u201cI agree with it at this point,\u201d said businessman Allan Zeman, who is also an economic adviser to Lam. \u201cYou have to do something drastic to end the violence. A lot of people will think twice about coming out.\u201d\n\nBut Hong Kong shares fell on Friday, hitting one-month lows.\n\nViolence escalated on Tuesday, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China, when police fired about 1,800 volleys of tear gas, 900 rubber bullets and six live bullets - one of which hit an 18-year-old.\n\nSlideshow (29 Images)\n\nThe student, Tony Tsang, was shot at close range as he fought an officer with what appeared to be a white pole. He has been charged with rioting, which carries a maximum 10-year sentence, and assaulting an officer. Tsang is in stable condition in hospital.\n\nThe shooting enraged the protesters who rampaged across the city, throwing petrol bombs, blocking roads and starting fires as police responded with tear gas.\n\nThe protesters are angry about what they see as creeping interference by Beijing in their city\u2019s affairs.\n\nChina dismisses accusations it is meddling and has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of stirring up anti-China sentiment.", "description": "Hong Kong's embattled leader Carrie Lam invoked colonial-era emergency powers on Friday for the first time in more than 50 years in a dramatic move intended to quell escalating violence in the Chinese-ruled city.", "authors": ["Clare Jim", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436944356&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF930JK", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
