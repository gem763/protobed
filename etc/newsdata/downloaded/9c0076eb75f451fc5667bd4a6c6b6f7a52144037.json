(Jorge Silva/Reuters)\n\nAcross Hong Kong, Beijing supporters on Saturday answered the call of a firebrand lawmaker to strip pro-democracy message boards plastered on walls and subway stations around the Asian financial capital, stoking fears of clashes and heightening divisions as anti-government protests push on into their sixteenth weekend.\n\nThe supporters on Saturday removed vibrant murals of Post-its and artwork known as \u201cLennon Walls\u201d that have become symbolic of the protest movement, avoiding confrontation, while pro-democracy protesters marched again and clashed with police, exchanging petrol bombs and tear gas.\n\n[Opinion: In Hong Kong, calls for democracy are written on the walls. Literally.]\n\n\u201cThey want to tear down all the material because they want to silence us,\u201d said a black-clad protester named John, 30, who works in real estate. \u201cWe don\u2019t care how much they tear down, we\u2019ll just come back tomorrow, every night and day.\u201d\n\nWhile tensions run high as four months of anti-government protests look to coincide with China\u2019s nearing 70th anniversary of Communist Party rule, protesters remained unfazed by the Lennon Wall sweep and showed no signs of backing down. Nor does the government show signs of concession, as the protests continue to polarize society.\n\n\n\nPro-government supporters on Saturday remove posters put up by pro-democracy demonstrators reading \u201cFree Hong Kong.

(Kyle Lam/Bloomberg)\n\nLennon Walls \u2014 public mosaics expressing support for democracy movement \u2014 have come to define Hong Kong\u2019s protest movement since it erupted in June over a controversial extradition bill. Though the bill has been shelved by the city\u2019s embattled leader Carrie Lam, protesters are digging in with their remaining four demands, including free elections and an independent inquiry into police violence this summer.\n\n[Hong Kong leader fully withdraws extradition bill, but protesters say it\u2019s not enough]\n\nBehind the Lennon-Wall sweep was outspoken lawmaker Junius Ho, who became a polarizing figure after a shocking subway attack on July 21 when a mob of white-shirted, rod-wielding men stormed a station and indiscriminately beat civilians, injuring at least 45 people including journalists and a lawmaker. Ho was accused of colluding with the attackers after he was filmed in the area that evening shaking hands with men wearing white. He has denied any connection.\n\nProtesters preempted the sweep by plastering pictures of Ho along footpaths of Lennon Walls so cleaners would need to rip down his photo. Passersby took videos of themselves walking along the runway of faces which had been drawn with fangs and other expletives.\n\n\u201cThey have the right to do it,\u201d a 35-year-old designer who identified himself by his surname Poon said, referring to Ho\u2019s supporters tearing down the Lennon walls. \u201cNo one can stop them. They have the right to express their opinions, only no violence.\u201d\n\nHo returned to headlines Wednesday after the powerful Hong Kong Jockey Club canceled a race in which his horse, \u201cHong Kong Bet,\u201d was participating. The club said it scrapped the event due to \u201cpotential social unrest,\u201d fearing the stadium would become the next protest flash point.\n\n\n\nPro-democracy protesters stand behind barricades during after a rally Saturday in Tuen Mun district.

A small group of protesters played soccer while others handed out protest gear such as face masks and protective identity card sleeves to prevent tracking of personal information. Police estimate 4,300 attended the Tuen Mun rally.\n\n[A run on gas masks: Hong Kong protesters circumvent crackdown on protective gear]\n\nHong Kong\u2019s subway closed two stations ahead of demonstrations in anticipation of clashes.\n\nOstensibly the purpose of the protest was to demonstrate the residential issue of damas, or \u201csinging aunties,\u201d women who sing loudly into microphones in parks late at night and dance for men and donations. Protests often latch onto local issues depending on the neighborhood in which they unfold. A police ban on the event was overturned.\n\nBut as the shouts and cheers indicated, it was another anti-government demonstration. Protesters in the stands cheered \u201cLiberate Hong Kong! Revolution of our times!\u201d and \u201cAdd oil!\u201d Black-clad protesters played soccer before unfolding umbrellas to kick off a march under the sweltering sun.\n\n\u201cThe Hong Kong government is still not responding to the five demands,\u201d said Harrison, 28, an airline worker. \u201cWe want to keep fighting until the day they respond to our five demands. We keep fighting until the police pay for what they\u2019ve done to us.\u201d\n\nBy late afternoon, the march devolved into confrontations between police and protesters near the shuttered subway station. Protesters threw bricks, built barricades and set fires. A few burned a Chinese flag \u2014 a major offense in the eyes of Beijing. Police charged the streets and fired tear gas.\n\n\n\nRiot police charge during a clash with protesters Saturday in Tuen Mun district.

The city was supposed to enjoy freedoms denied to those in mainland China, such as rule of law, a free press and independent judiciary.\n\nRead more:\n\nTikTok\u2019s Beijing roots fuel censorship suspicion as it builds a huge U.S. audience\n\nAttackers wielding Chinese flags bash Hong Kong protesters as political crisis takes sinister turn\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Hong Kong protesters defied threats and intimidation from pro-Beijing groups, marching again in a part of the city where they clashed with police.", "authors": ["Casey Quackenbush", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/-ymM-DJQkgXsRoykGyhK5cQpAMs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/H57OMVW4PEI6TP5RQSMIONUUOY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
