It is in the best interests of my client to unravel the corruption in the Ukraine which involve mostly collusion in the election into which Joe Biden inserted himself.\u201d\n\nMr Giuliani, who has been subpoenaed for documents by the House Democrats, has repeatedly claimed that Mr Biden acted corruptly in Ukraine on behalf of his son Hunter.\n\nA former prosecutor in Ukraine said last month the the former vice president's son \"did not violate anything\".\n\nRead more\n\nIt has since emerged that he was warned by US envoy Kurt Volker that his sources were \u201cuntrustworthy\u201d.
