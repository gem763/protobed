Her placard read: \u201cI\u2019m missing school for this (Better be worth it!)\u201d\n\nAs protests spread to London, placards read: \u201cMelt the 1% before they melt us\u201d, and \u201cAct now or swim later,\u201d while in Vienna, two girls held up a card saying \u201cMake love not Co2\u201d.\n\nIn Australia, messages included: \u201cWe\u2019ll go to school when the earth is cool\u201d and \u201cNo beer on a dead planet\u201d.\n\nRising sea levels inspired a terse warning from a woman in Melbourne, whose sign read: \u201cLearn to change or learn to swim.\u201d\n\nRaging wildfires meanwhile prompted a pithy message from another Melbourne woman, whose picture of a burning Australia was captioned: \u201cWe\u2019re cactus mate!\u201d\n\nA group of protesters in Sri Lanka made a stern point:\u201dPoliticians who ignore climate change are climate criminals\u201d.
