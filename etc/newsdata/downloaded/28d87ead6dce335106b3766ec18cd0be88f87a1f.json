He knows it will be back soon. I don't think anything could make him upset, he's such a happy child.\"\n\nUnlike Maxx a lot of children have been upset by the Fortnite shutdown.\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\nAnother mum, Anna Harper said her 13-year-old, who has autism, plays the game everyday.\n\n\"He had a timer set on his phone for the big event yesterday and we had to be in to see it,\" Anna said.\n\n\"Then this happened and he refused to go to bed because the big event wasn't finished. He just wanted to watch the black hole all night in case it came back on.\n\n\"He came home from school today and has been logged in all afternoon watching to see if it changes.\n\n\"He is very worried that it will disappear forever. It would be useful to have a bit of information as to why or when so I can try to explain it to him.\"\n\nIt is not known when or if the game will be back online.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE Maxx Honhold watched as his beloved video game was reduced to a black screen, with some predicting the Season 10 event could mark the beginning of a Fortnite Chapter 2", "authors": ["Milo Boyd", "Image", "Mirrorpix"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20580322.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Emma-Broughton.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
