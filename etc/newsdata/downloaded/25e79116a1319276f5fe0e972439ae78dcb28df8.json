Impeachment and the scandal that brought it about complicated Vice President Al Gore\u2019s presidential campaign, leading to a narrow victory by Republican George W. Bush, who pledged to \u201crestore honor and dignity\u201d to the White House.\n\nChristopher Lawrence, a professor of political science at Middle Georgia State University who has studied Clinton\u2019s impeachment, said Democrats are also in a much different position now. Polls show Republicans are already highly supportive of Trump and extremely enthusiastic about voting in 2020, so impeachment may not change much among those voters, especially when the election is still 13 months away.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think at this point there\u2019s anything that you can do to motivate Trump supporters more than they already are to vote for him in 2020,\u201d he said. \u201cReally, the question is whether it will motivate Democrats to vote.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["R.T.
