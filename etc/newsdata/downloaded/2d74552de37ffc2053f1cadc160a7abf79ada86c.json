And NOAA leadership did find a single forecast tool that indicated a small part of southeastern Alabama faced a 5 to 10 percent chance of experiencing 40 mile per hour winds.\n\nYet this is beside the point, because Alabama never actually experienced those winds. In the course of this week, winds in Alaga, Alabama\u2014a town in the state\u2019s southeastern-most corner\u2014never exceeded 9 miles per hour, according to the weather-almanac database Dark Sky.\n\nAnd if NOAA is in a mood to nitpick: President Trump\u2019s statements disagreed far more with \u201cprobabilities from the best forecast products available\u201d than the Birmingham office\u2019s did. At no point was Alabama \u201cmost likely [to] be hit (much) harder than anticipated.\u201d And this is not even the most egregious example. \u201cThey actually gave that a 95 percent chance probability. It turned out that that was not what happened,\u201d Trump said on Thursday. The National Weather Service never forecast that Dorian had a 95 percent chance of hitting Alabama.", "description": "", "authors": ["Robinson Meyer", "Theatlantic.Com Science Archive Noaa-Trump-Hurricane-Dorian-Alabama"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
