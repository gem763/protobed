So all that helped us with the decision to put him there as the first replacement and it paid off.\u201d\n\nOndrasek launched his career with then second division Ceske Budejovice in 2007 before spending time in the third tier.\n\nHe eventually got a move to top-flight Norwegian club Tromso in 2012 before joining Wisla Krakow in 2016 where he scored 20 league goals in 66 matches in the Polish first division.\n\nOndrasek, whose nickname comes from a giant cobra tattoo on his back, notched seven goals in 17 appearances for FC Dallas in his innaugural season after signing for the MLS club in 2018.\n\nFor the Czechs, his first cap could not have come at a better time. The result means they join group leaders England on 12 points with four wins, though they have played a game more.\n\n\u201cWe made the choice for Zdenek, it proved to be the right one,\u201d Silhavy said. \u201cIt is always like this that when a coach picks a new player and that player scores, then it is the coach\u2019s golden hand.\u201d", "description": "Czech Republic forward Zdenek Ondrasek waited more than a decade for his national team debut but the man known as the \"Czech Cobra\" took his chance with a late goal that secured a famous 2-1 win over England in their Euro qualifier on Friday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439867889&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A28J", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
