Here's how to convince South Africa's major cities to spend that money in your neighbourhood.\n\nFor more stories go to the Business Insider South Africa homepage.\n\nSpeed bumps are the most effective way to slow traffic, but they can also be a significant annoyance particularly if you're unfortunate enough to own a low-slung Bugatti Veyron.\n\n\n\nThey can also be an unpredictable hazard \u2013 because there are little more than suggestions as to what their dimension should be, making for speed humps in South Africa that range from barely-there to basically-mountains.\n\nAccording to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research\u2019s (CSIR) national guidelines on the matter, most requests for speed humps in South Africa are motivated by the need to restrict speeds on dangerous roads, or discourage people from rat-running through residential neighbourhoods to avoid traffic.\n\nAnd provided they are constructed to the appropriate dimensions, the CSIR says that they are extremely effective.\n\nBut anyone who\u2019s been caught off-guard by a particularly ferocious hump will attest to the fact that many are not, in fact, built to anything close to appropriate dimensions.\n\nIn South Africa there is no national law, or even enforceable guidelines, governing how intense your speed hump experience should be. And even where there are municipal blueprints for contractors to follow, they might be allowed to use their discretion and stray far from the recommended slope, height, and width.\n\nIt\u2019s not just on the public roads, either; South Africa\u2019s private housing estates have some of the most egregious examples of \u201ctraffic calming\u201d.\n\nWhy South Africa has such a variety of of speed humps\n\nMunicipal requirements for speed humps vary from city to city, or even road to road, where contractors are allowed to exercise their discretion.\n\nAccording to Dr Louis Roodt, a civil engineer at the University of Stellenbosch, this is where many of the hump installations go wrong.\n\n\u201cThe problem lies in the municipalities that do not have expertise,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd they build these \u2018sleeping policemen\u2019 to their own dimensions.\u201d\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s current speed bump guidelines also date back some 35 years, and have received little in the way of updates since then.\n\n\u201cThe first research in South Africa was by Alister Jobson at the CSIR, around mid-1980s,\u201d says Roodt. \u201cThis was based on the then Transport and Road Research Laboratory's guidelines of 100mm high, and 3.65 metres long, with a circular or sinusoidal profile.\u201d\n\nThese guidelines have remained fairly consistent over the years, though there\u2019s been an increase in flat-topped humps, the kind the usually have pedestrian crossings built into their summit.\n\nThe CSIR says most cities have done away with trying to build the more complex sinusoidal humps, and the flat-topped ones are often too expensive. As a result, traditional round-topped speed humps are still the most common way to calm traffic - and wreck sumps.\n\nThis is what speed bumps should actually look like...\n\nThe CSIR recommends that rounded speed bumps should be 3.7 metres long \u2013 or about twice as long as an adult \u2013 and between 80mm and 120mm high, depending on how much they are supposed to restrict speed.\n\nThe higher the hump, the greater the speed restriction. At 80mm high over a width of 4 metres, the CSIR says, cars shouldn\u2019t be able to traverse a hump at more than 50km/h. Increase the height to 120mm, and the maximum speed drops to 30km/h.\n\nOfficially, each municipality has its own guidelines on how big humps should be. And on paper they don\u2019t stray far from the recommendations.\n\nThe City of Johannesburg, for example, suggests that rounded speed humps should be 4 metres wide, and have a maximum height of 75mm.\n\nIn Durban, the Ethekwini Transport Authority also suggests that speed humps be 75mm high, over a distance of 3.8 metres. But the official document for Ethekwini allows for the traffic calming official to \u201cfrom time to time, at his or her sole discretion, review and amend\u201d these dimensions where necessary.\n\nThere are also important guidelines about safety. Humps must be clearly visible to motorists at day and night; the CSIR says humps should not be in the shade, and lighting is \u201cessential\u201d, as are municipally-mandated warning signs and reflective road markings.\n\n... but all too often they don't.\n\nIn spite of these clear guidelines, examples of \u201cvicious\u201d, difficult-to-spot humps exist across the country.\n\n\n\nOne, in Hilton, KwaZulu Natal, went up in a single day, and was quickly scraped back down after community complaints that it didn\u2019t follow recommended guidelines.\n\nA large, unmarked speed hump in Hillcrest also left residents fuming with the local municipality.\n\nAnd in 2015, the KwaZulu-Natal MEC for transport agreed to pay 50% of damages suffered by a motorcyclist after an encounter with a hazardous unmarked hump.\n\nRoodt says the majority of \u201chorrific\u201d speed humps are usually the result of road authorities or home owners\u2019 associations trying to save money.\n\n\u201cThey get a contractor in at the cheapest price without a formal design,\u201d says Roodt, \u201cOften with contractors claiming to have built hundreds of humps.\u201d\n\nThis leads to problematic designs that can cause damage to vehicles.\n\n\u201cOften they are not even painted or warned of, and the visitors unfamiliar with the hump are surprised by a bone-shaking, teeth-clapping vertical acceleration,\u201d he says.\n\nRoodt says the worst examples on public and private roads are often due to residents\u2019 pressure, rather than a true understanding of effective traffic calming measures.\n\nSpeed bumps cost at least R20,000 to install. Here's how to get one installed in your neighbourhood.\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for people in South Africa to take traffic calming measures into their own hands - by digging trenches, or piling sand and other debris across the road - especially after fatal accidents.\n\nBut even official speed humps aren\u2019t a silver bullet. They aren\u2019t recommended for routes used regularly by emergency vehicles, busses and trucks, and can increase traffic noise, vibrations, and pollution.\n\nAnd although they look simple enough to build, they\u2019re surprisingly expensive if done correctly, owing to the amount of skilled labour required to install them to the guidelines.\n\nRoodt, who now sits on the Stanford Ward Committee, says they budgeted R50,000 for a raised pedestrian crossing.\n\nSmaller speed humps cost slightly less, though. The City of Cape Town\u2019s Transport network and facilitation manager Sean Glass told Cape Talk in 2017 that a single hump costs between R20,000 to R25,000 to construct - with a turnaround time of around two days.\n\nBecause of the cost, potential drawbacks, and the fact that they\u2019re not suitable for all types of roads, getting speed bumps installed on city roads - with city money - is a difficult process.\n\nMost local governments require residents to submit comprehensive applications via their ward councillors for speed bumps to be installed in their area.\n\nHere is how Johannesburg, Cape Town, and Durban decide where to put speed bumps.\n\nJohannesburg\n\n\"Due to the high demand for traffic calming, installation of traffic calming in the form of speed humps is undertaken by the Road Traffic Engineering Department on a strict priority basis,\" according to the Johannesburg Roads Agency,\n\nApplications for traffic calming measures in Johannesburg must include letters of support from the ward councillor, the City of Johannesburg\u2019s regional directors office, and Johannesburg Metro Police Department, along with drawings for the proposed location.\n\nCape Town\n\nThe City of Cape Town says it cannot keep up with the requests for traffic calming measures to be installed.\n\nAccording to the city\u2019s policy document on traffic calming, \u201cThe waiting list for implementation of projects now exceeds 500 with an estimated cost of R30million \u2013 a capital allocation that has not materialised.\u201d\n\nThe city places an emphasis on traffic calming measures around schools and other high risk areas. Residents must first contact their ward councillors - who will work with them to submit an application to the relevant authorities, if he or she agrees with the notion.\n\nDurban\n\nThe Ethekwini Transport Authority has issued a document that details the city\u2019s approach to traffic calming measures.\n\nApplications for speed humps and other traffic calming measures should go through local ward councillors, who will then forward the relevant documents to the Traffic Calming Official. This official will then conduct an assessment of the proposed location, and inform the councillor of the outcome.", "description": "There are national guidelines on what speed bumps should like like, but municipalities \u2013 and private complexes \u2013\u00a0tend to do their own thing.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9520/ef790682041842a08179189d3b4ba9b4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
