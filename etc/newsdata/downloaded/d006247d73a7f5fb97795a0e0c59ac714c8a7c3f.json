The Star Wars fan community, for example, is a complicated universe unto itself, overrun with negative forces and bad actors dead set on imposing their outdated values.\n\nAccording to these extremely vocal fans, there\u2019s no place in the galaxy for people of color and empowered female protagonists. Aided by social media, these racist meninists have banded together, organizing under hashtags like #BoycottStarWarsVII and #DumpStarWars.\n\nIt would be one thing if these detractors were just passing their trash takes back and forth in toxic Twitter hashtags. But angry fans have unleashed their hate on innocent individuals like Kelly Marie Tran, the Last Jedi actress whose exciting casting as Rose Tico was quickly met with racist rhetoric and online harassment. According to Newsweek, Tran\u2019s page on Wookieepedia was defaced: \u201cHer name was changed to \u2018Ching Chong Wing Tong,\u2019 and her homeworld (Hays Minor) to \u2018Ching Chong China.\u2019 A fake quote was also attributed to Rose: \u2018Heil Hitler and I don\u2019t know why I was casted [sic] in a good movie like Star Wars.\u2019\u201d\n\nTran reportedly deleted all of the posts on her Instagram in response to \u201cmonths of harassment.\u201d What should have been a huge step forward\u2014Tran was the first woman of color to be cast as a Star Wars lead\u2014served as yet another reminder of how far the fandom still has to go, and the very real challenges that actors from marginalized communities face even after they land the role of a lifetime.\n\nWhile fandoms across the fantasy, sci-fi, and comics spectrum aren\u2019t exclusively male or white, these fans seem to be operating under the impression that this content belongs to them; they feel personally threatened by an increasingly diverse Star Wars cast or an all-female reboot. Unsurprisingly, there\u2019s overlap between Last Jedi haters and the alt-right\u2014and don\u2019t forget that Donald Trump himself was a vocal opponent of 2016\u2019s all-female Ghostbusters.\n\n\u201c Shockingly, the predictable backlash to Ruby Rose\u2019s recently announced casting appears to actually be coming from inside the house. \u201d\n\nSo when the CW announced that they were looking for an out actress to play a lesbian Batwoman in a new TV show\u2014the first gay superhero to headline a live-action series\u2014you could see the backlash coming from a mile away. The description of the character read like a mash-up of shit that neo-Nazis don\u2019t like: \u201cArmed with a passion for social justice and a flair for speaking her mind, Kate Kane soars onto the streets of Gotham as Batwoman, an out lesbian and highly trained street fighter primed to snuff out the failing city\u2019s criminal resurgence.\u201d The sneering Breitbart blog post basically writes itself.\n\nShockingly, the backlash to Ruby Rose\u2019s recently announced casting appears to actually be coming from inside the house\u2014from fans who seem to love the idea of an out actress playing Kate Kane, but want more from their trailblazing lesbian superhero.\n\nAccording to Deadline, Batwoman was revived in 2006 as a Jewish lesbian\u2014the first lesbian title character in the DC universe. Back in May, it was announced that Batwoman would appear in the upcoming CW Arrowverse crossover event. Then came the news that Kate Kane would likely follow up that appearance with her own TV show, from Vampire Diaries executive producer Caroline Dries and Arrowverse visionary Greg Berlanti.\n\nLast week, Ruby Rose celebrated her casting in an Instagram post, writing, \u201c This is something I would have died to have seen on TV when I was a young member of the LGBT community who never felt represented on tv and felt alone and different.\u201d\n\nBut just two days after the announcement, Rose quit Twitter in a series of tweets that appeared to call out critiques from the queer community, including misguided allegations that the gender fluid actor \u201cis not a lesbian.\u201d In the now-deleted message, Rose wrote, \u201cWhere on earth did \u2018Ruby is not a lesbian therefore she can\u2019t be batwoman\u2019 come from -- has to be the funniest most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve ever read. I came out at 12? And have for the past 5 years had to deal with \u2018she\u2019s too gay\u2019 how do y\u2019all flip it like that? I didn\u2019t change. I wish we would all support each other and our journeys.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen women and when minorities join forces we are unstoppable... when we tear each other down it\u2019s much more hurtful than from any group,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut hey/ love a challenge I just wish women and the LGBT community supported each other more, My wish was we were all a little kinder and more supportive of each other...Sending everyone my love and gratitude, it\u2019s been a rollercoaster of a year, this month especially.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am looking forward to getting more than 4 hours of sleep and to break from Twitter to focus all my energy on my next 2 projects. If you need me, I\u2019ll be on my Bat Phone.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Twitter hashtag #RecastBatwoman is still going strong. Recurring sentiments appear to be that Batwoman should be played by a Jewish lesbian, and that the role would have been a great opportunity to elevate new talent. Sample tweets include, \u201c Ruby is great... But she is not the only queer actress out there\u201d and \u201cJEWISH LESBIAN CHARACTER SHOULD BE PLAYED BY A JEWISH LESBIAN.\u201d\n\nThe hashtag denizens have rallied around another actress, Ashley Platz, whose Batwoman audition tape has been widely circulated. One Twitter user wrote, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t Ashley got the part, her audition had a great positive reaction in the lgbt community.\u201d Another added, \u201cHey \u202a@TheCW the people \u202a#Batwoman is for want and support Ashley Platz. She\u2019s a fantastic actress who became Kate in that audition. She\u2019s done stunt work, she\u2019s got the look, she\u2019s absolutely perfect. So \u202a#RecastBatwoman because Kate Kane is NOT a popularity contest.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s even a Change.org petition from \u201cSupergirl Fan\u201d begging the CW and Greg Berlanti to give Platz the part. It\u2019s gotten to the point that Platz herself has logged on to defend Ruby Rose, tweeting, \u201cSeeing so many people \u202a#recastbatwoman and rooting for me. First: I appreciate how much support and love you\u2019re sending my way. Second: I know This role means a lot to Ruby (it would mean a lot to me) and she will work her ass off to fulfill the character. \u202a#Batwoman\u202a. \u201d\n\n\u201cTo be clear: \u202a@RubyRose is going to kick ass,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m so happy that \u202a@TheCW is bringing \u202a#Batwoman to life no matter who plays her. It\u2019s so important that we see this character no matter what! We got your back mama!\u201d\n\nThe news that Rose is shutting down her Twitter was predictably celebrated by the diehard recasters, with comments like, \u201cWhen DC fans & LGBT fans don\u2019t want something we can be powerful.\u201d Meanwhile, celebrities like Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Trace Lysette and Laverne Cox have celebrated Rose and applauded the historic casting.", "description": "Enraged DC fans have chased the out actress off social media following her historic casting as Kate Kane/Batwoman in a new TV series.", "authors": ["Amy Zimmerman", "Entertainment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1080,w_1920,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1534207185/180813-zimmerman-rose-batwoman-hero_mi3c3j", "published_at": "2018-08-14"}
