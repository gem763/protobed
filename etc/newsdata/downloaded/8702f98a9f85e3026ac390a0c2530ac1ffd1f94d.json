He acquired the stake just two months before he was ousted in a general election amid popular anger over corruption.\n\nBut with the completion of the 106-storey glass and steel tower, and support from the new administration led by Najib's former mentor-turned-foe, Mahathir Mohamad, Indonesian developer Mulia Group believes the spectre of 1MDB is now behind them.\n\nIn February, Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng declared the TRX \"detoxified\" of 1MDB's taint, after a review found that the government would be able to recover its opportunity cost and investments, according to local media reports.\n\nThe building, which has a sweeping view of the city, already has a fifth of its 2.6 million square feet of rental space locked down, with its first tenants expected to come in between December and June, said Mulia official Patrick Honan.\n\n\"We expect the take up to grow to 1.3 million square feet by the end of next year,\" Honan said during a media tour.\n\nSome potential tenants include a top Fortune 500 global consulting firm, a Hong Kong-based personal care brand, e-commerce platforms, and a serviced office and co-working brand.\n\nBesides Exchange 106, HSBC and Affin Bank are building a tower each in the TRX, and Australian property firm Lendlease is building a shopping mall, hotel and several condominiums.\n\nHowever, Kuala Lumpur's office rental market outlook \"remains cloudy\", as new buildings that have no major tenants end up competing with existing office space, global property consultant Knight Frank said in its H1 2019 report on Malaysian real estate.\n\nHonan remained optimistic, saying that confirmed and prospective tenants are looking at the big picture of the future potential of the TRX. \"We will see dramatic moves in occupancy once the full TRX development is complete,\" he said.\n\n($1 = 4.1880 ringgit) (Reporting by Joseph Sipalan, Editing by William Maclean)", "description": "Malaysia's tallest skyscraper is ready to take in tenants from December, its developer said on Wednesday, looking to move past its links to the 1MDB scandal and focus on making headway in an oversupplied property market.
