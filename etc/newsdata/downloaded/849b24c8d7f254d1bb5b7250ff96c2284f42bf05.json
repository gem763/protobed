(AP) \u2014 At least 12 white supremacists have been arrested on allegations of plotting, threatening or carrying out anti-Semitic attacks in the U.S. since the massacre at a Pittsburgh synagogue nearly one year ago, a Jewish civil rights group reported Sunday.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League also counted at least 50 incidents in which white supremacists are accused of targeting Jewish institutions\u2019 property since a gunman killed 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue on Oct. 27, 2018. Those incidents include 12 cases of vandalism involving white supremacist symbols and 35 cases in which white supremacist propaganda was distributed.\n\nThe ADL said its nationwide count of anti-Semitic incidents remains near record levels. It has counted 780 anti-Semitic incidents in the first six months of 2019, compared to 785 incidents during the same period in 2018.\n\nThe ADL\u2019s tally of 12 arrests for white supremacist plots, threats and attacks against Jewish institutions includes the April 2019 capture of John T. Earnest, who is charged with killing one person and wounding three others in a shooting at a synagogue in Poway, California. The group said many of the cases it counted, including the Poway shooting, were inspired by previous white supremist attacks. In online posts, Earnest said he was inspired by the deadly attacks in Pittsburgh and on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, where a gunman killed 51 people in March.\n\nThe ADL also counted three additional 2019 cases in which individuals were arrested for targeting Jews but weren\u2019t deemed to be white supremacists. Two were motivated by Islamist extremist ideology, the organization said.\n\nThe ADL said its Center on Extremism provided \u201ccritical intelligence\u201d to law enforcement in at least three of the 12 cases it counted.\n\nLast December, authorities in Monroe, Washington, arrested a white supremacist after the ADL notified law enforcement about suspicions he threatened on Facebook to kill Jews in a synagogue. The ADL said it also helped authorities in Lehighton, Pennsylvania, identify a white supremacist accused of using aliases to post threatening messages, including a digital image of himself pointing an AR-15 rifle at a group of praying Jewish men.\n\nIn August, an FBI-led anti-terrorism task force arrested a Las Vegas man accused of plotting to firebomb a synagogue or other targets, including a bar catering to LGTBQ customers and the ADL\u2019s Las Vegas office. The ADL said it warned law enforcement officials about the man\u2019s online threats.\n\n\u201cWe cannot and will not rest easy knowing the threat posed by white supremacists and other extremists against the Jewish community is clear and present,\u201d the group\u2019s CEO, Jonathan Greenblatt, said in a statement.\n\nThe ADL said it counted at least 30 additional incidents in which people with an \u201cunknown ideology\u201d targeted Jewish institutions with acts of arson, vandalism or propaganda distribution that the group deemed to be anti-Semitic or \u201cgenerally hateful,\u201d but not explicitly white supremacist.\n\n\u201cThese incidents include the shooting of an elderly man outside a synagogue in Miami, fires set at multiple Jewish institutions in New York and Massachusetts, Molotov cocktails thrown at synagogue windows in Chicago, damaged menorahs in Georgia and New Jersey, as well as a wide range of anti-Semitic graffiti,\u201d an ADL report said.", "description": "The Anti-Defamation League said its nationwide count of anti-Semitic incidents remains near record levels.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5dad06b520000072195063c6.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
