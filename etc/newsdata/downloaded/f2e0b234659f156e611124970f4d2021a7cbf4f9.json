Not only do the allegations suggest that Mr. Trump was using the power of his office to extract political gains from a foreign power, they argued, but his administration is actively trying once again to prevent Congress from finding out what happened.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to do any more to contribute to the divisiveness in the country, but my biggest responsibility as an elected official is to protect our national security and Constitution,\u201d said Representative Debbie Dingell of Michigan, adding that it is \u201cbecoming more and more difficult\u201d for Democrats to avoid an all-out impeachment inquiry.\n\nSeveral first-term lawmakers who had opposed impeachment conferred privately over the weekend to discuss announcing support for an inquiry, potentially jointly, after a hearing scheduled for Thursday with the acting national intelligence director, according to Democratic officials familiar with the conversations. A handful of them declined to speak on the record over the weekend, with some still reluctant to go public and others looking for cues from Ms. Pelosi and their freshman colleagues.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Politics Trump-Impeachment-Whistle-Blower.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
