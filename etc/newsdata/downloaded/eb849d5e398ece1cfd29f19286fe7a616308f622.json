We\u2019re here to make it a bit smaller, a bit more manageable. There are a lot of great shows, and each one has a lot of great episodes, so we want to highlight the exceptional, the noteworthy. Each week, our crack team of podcast enthusiasts and specialists and especially enthusiastic people will pick their favorites. We hope to have your ears permanently plugged with the best in aural comedy.\n\nThey Call Us Bruce \u2014 They Call Us Constance Wu\n\nNot counting a guest spot on the 100th episode of Spontaneanation back in 2017 and a now-vanished THR chat in 2015, there has never been a definitive Constance Wu podcast interview \u2014 until now. Wu finally tells all on They Call Us Bruce, Jeff Yang (CNN) and Phil Yu\u2019s (Angry Asian Man) weekly primer on all things Asian-American. To the surprise of absolutely no one, the Hustlers star makes for a charming guest, even pointing out every time she says something that could be a clickbait headline. Of course, she eventually opens up about the infamous Fresh Off the Boat tweets, bringing nuance to the story that clears the air a lot quicker than 280 characters could. An added bonus: Jeff Yang\u2019s son is Hudson Yang, who plays her son Eddie on the show and has remained in his stage mom\u2019s corner throughout the controversy. The show closes out by playing \u201cThe Good, the Bad, and the WTF\u201d about breaking stereotypes. It\u2019s a must-listen conversation for anyone interested in Asian-American representation in Hollywood or any representation at all. The three push the discourse far beyond the superficial \u201clook, Asian men have abs\u201d ledes and explain why Asian-Americans have such a strong first instinct to be skeptical of any sort of representation. \u2014Mark Kramer\n\nListen: Spotify | Apple | Website\n\nLas Culturistas \u2014 Thick Joy With Ilana Glazer\n\nAbout a week ago when Matt Rogers and Bowen Yang posted a picture alongside Ilana Glazer in the Forever Dog Studio, teasing an upcoming episode, you\u2019d have to have been a fool to expect such an episode to be anything but incredible. Now that the episode has finally landed in our queues, it is of course a slam dunk, which is basketball for very good. To start things off, they get topical, finally unpacking all that is Taylor Swift\u2019s album, Lover (FWIW, I don\u2019t think the actual Lover holds a candle to the Matt Rogers version), sharing fall fashion predictions, and most importantly, discussing the Dunstassaince that\u2019s currently underway. What a blessing to hear Glazer confirm that, having met Kirsten Dunst, she seems just as great as we all hope her to be. To get fully caught up on the Dunstassaince, the George Civeris episode is required listening. Later, Glazer answers all their questions about what it was like working with RuPaul, Fran Drescher, and Susie Essman, and how it feels now that Broad City has ended. As someone with a soft spot for people saying nice things about their friends, hearing Ilana speak so highly of Abbi, as well as the Las Culturistas themselves each sharing their feelings about the other one, this conversation left me gutted. But gutted in the good way, not in the Kirsten Dunst in On Becoming a God in Central Florida and an alligator way \u2014Leigh Cesiro\n\nListen: Spotify | Apple | Website\n\nThe Need to Fail \u2014 Scott Aukerman\n\nFor life in the universe, everything started with a bang. In the case of podcasting, some may say the same thing. Instead of galaxies forming, however, this new bang proved to be a driving force that shaped the podcasting landscape as we know it. The Comedy Bang Bang if you will. This week, CBB host and co-founder of Earwolf, Scott Aukerman, joins Don Fanelli on The Need to Fail. With the two covering everything from Aukerman\u2019s time in acting school to his early days on HBO\u2019s Mr. Show, even the biggest Aukermaniacs will learn something new about the comedian here. For me, this conversation really kicks into gear when they dive into the history of Earwolf. Aukerman is quick to say that without co-founder Jeff Ullrich, the network may not have survived. Although the quality, in terms of shows may have always been there, Aukerman points out that advertisers were slow to jump onboard. He even recalls being laughed out of the room by a major corporation who took a meeting with them, despite not knowing what a podcast was. With the current state of podcasting being a major topic of discussion recently, Aukerman\u2019s historical recap of Earwolf\u2019s formation proves to be an interesting listen. \u2014Tom Rainey\n\nListen: Spotify | Apple | Website\n\nNight Call \u2014 The Midsommar Monster Spectacular With John Levenstein\n\nSummer vacation is over and Tess Lynch, Molly Lambert, and Emily Yoshida are back, and on a brand new network (HowStuffWorks). And what better way to celebrate Endsommar than with a deep dive into Midsommar? The triumphant return to Night Call\u2019s musty basement is for the summer horror romp that was practically made for these three to discuss. Yoshida has already interviewed creator Ari Aster for this very website, but together they gaze even further into the film\u2019s blue-eyed, blonde-haired subtext and themes. A night caller from Sweden even sends in details about the real-life Midsommar festival\u2019s connection to grisly deaths. After a palate-cleanser call that inspires schemes to (a) get bit by a cat-fox to become a were-cat-fox and (b) open an Airbnb for bats (an \u201cAirbatnbat,\u201d obviously), comedy heavyweight John Levenstein joins to promote his summer Netflix mockumentary, Frankenstein\u2019s Monster\u2019s Monster, Frankenstein. Many laughs are had at the expense of I, Claudius and other old Hollywood inspiration for the special. New home or not, Night Call is back squarely in its cozy groove. \u2014Mark Kramer\n\nListen: Spotify | Apple | Website\n\nGhosted! \u2014 Psychic Medium Elena Servidio-Schwinn\n\nComedian Roz Drezfalez offers horror and humor in equal measure with Ghosted!, a podcast dedicated to exploring \u201cthings that go \u2018bump\u2019 in the night.\u201d Each week, Drezfalez invites a guest to share their personal ghost story while she thoroughly interviews them. This week, psychic medium Elena Servidio-Schwinn shakes things up by turning the spotlight on Drezfalez and her most intimate interactions. Servidio-Schwinn also discusses her various skills, which range from in-person cleansings to social media readings. The funniest part of her profession, however, comes when she encounters another medium who attempts to enter her brain. In response, Servidio-Schwinn says she looked the other medium dead in the eye and said, \u201cDon\u2019t even think you\u2019re better than me.\u201d While Servidio-Schwinn takes this very seriously, the notion of fighting psychics elicits an expected laugh from Drezfalez. Another thing Servidio-Schwinn takes seriously is the Conjuring franchise. If you think that stuff is a joke, you\u2019re wrong, but again, if you feel the need to laugh you\u2019re not alone. As Drezfalez says, \u201cLight some sage and pop your popcorn\u201d for a spooky and sassy listen that touches on the funnier side of the unknown. \u2014Becca James\n\nListen: Spotify | Apple | Website\n\nOther Podcasts We\u2019re Listening To:\n\nDoughboys \u2014 Popeyes 2 With Andrew Ti\n\nListen: Spotify | Apple | Website\n\nPop Culture Happy Hour \u2014 The Movies of 1999\n\nListen: Spotify | Apple | Website\n\nYou\u2019re Making It Worse \u2014 Guy Branum\n\nListen: Spotify | Apple | Website\n\nGot a comedy podcast recommendation?
