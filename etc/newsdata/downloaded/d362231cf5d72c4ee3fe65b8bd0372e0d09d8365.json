I think that would be an interesting turn.\n\n'Whatever the case, I'm glad Nate's identity has been kept under wraps for now. I hope it stays that way until the reveal actually airs.'\n\nAnother fan added: 'Yeah Nate Is really Nathan Dingle Jr. makes perfect sense.'\n\nRivals: Since he arrived in the village in April, Nate has caused carnage thanks to having flings with various women, culminating in his and Moira's steamy affair\n\nAll will be revealed: Actress Sally Dexter - who plays Cain's mum Faith Dingle - previously hinted that fans will learn the truth about Nate's identity in the coming weeks\n\nNon-stop: The scenes will come as part of an action-packed week in the Dales\n\nActress Sally Dexter - who plays Faith - previously hinted that fans will learn the truth about Nate's identity in the coming weeks.\n\nSpeaking to The Sun at the Inside Soap Awards last week, she said: 'Yes we are going to find out who Nate really is but my lips are sealed.'\n\nThe scenes will come as part of an action-packed week in the Dales, as Chas Dingle finally gives birth to a baby boy, and Robert Sugden goes on the run with husband Aaron Dingle.\n\nEmmerdale airs these scenes from Monday 21st October at 7pm on ITV.", "description": "Emmerdale will see one character lose their life next week, as Cain Dingle finally discovers his wife Moira's affair.", "authors": ["Laura Fox For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/12/19737338-0-image-a-63_1571138070915.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
