How long will it last? Who will conduct it? And will Pelosi\u2019s unilateral pronouncement \u2014 which was delivered with no immediate plans to ratify it with a House vote \u2014 do anything to change the course of existing investigations that have hit a stone wall of White House resistance?\n\nPelosi (D-Calif.) on Tuesday gave only a cursory outline in her public remarks, noting that she would be \u201cdirecting our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella of impeachment inquiry.\u201d In a closed-door meeting of Democratic lawmakers Tuesday, she was only slightly more voluble \u2014 promising an \u201cexpeditious\u201d inquiry, according to lawmakers present.\n\nThe lack of detail about the road ahead, according to interviews with more than a dozen Democratic lawmakers and aides, reflected both the speed with which once-wavering Democrats unified behind a formal impeachment probe \u2014 and the continuing divisions among them on how it should be conducted.\n\nAccording to the Democrats, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations, the House Judiciary Committee will continue playing the lead role in the proceedings, despite the desire of some Democrats to involve a broader swath of lawmakers and to at least partly sideline Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), the panel\u2019s fervently pro-impeachment chairman.\n\nIn the days leading up to Tuesday\u2019s announcement, Pelosi explored potentially establishing a special \u201cselect\u201d committee, with members handpicked by House leaders, but backed away from that idea after the dispute generated protests from liberals and threatened to divide the caucus along ideological lines.\n\n\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) appears at a labor rally in Washington on Tuesday. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nMeanwhile, an even more fundamental dispute lingered \u2014 one that may not be resolved any time soon. Many Democrats are urging that the inquiry focus solely on the present outcry \u2014 Trump\u2019s apparent admission that he urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look for wrongdoing by the son of former vice president Joe Biden while withholding delivery of U.S. foreign aid \u2014 and not on other alleged abuses, such as the potential obstruction of justice detailed by Robert S. Mueller III as special counsel, episodes of congressional stonewalling and instances of bigotry.\n\nMore than 30 Democratic lawmakers announced support for impeachment just this week, many of them Democratic \u201cfrontliners\u201d in vulnerable districts who said that the Ukraine allegations prompted them to speak out. Several said in interviews that the unique nature of the alleged episode \u2014 and the fact that it dealt squarely with Trump\u2019s conduct as president and national security \u2014 counseled for it to be handled on its own.\n\n\u201cThis should be a very distinct procedure relative to this allegation, rather than the whole basket,\u201d said Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), a freshman who backed impeachment proceedings Monday after months of resisting pressure to take that step. \u201cA lot of independents and a lot of Republicans are very like-minded, in particular, relative to this specific instance. And that\u2019s why I think we\u2019re looking at this so differently.\u201d\n\nBut Pelosi\u2019s involvement of other committees besides the Judiciary, Foreign Affairs and Intelligence panels with direct jurisdiction over the Ukraine matter suggest the impeachment brief could go much wider. The Financial Services Committee, for instance, is probing Trump\u2019s real estate dealings; the Ways and Means Committee is seeking Trump\u2019s tax returns; and the Oversight and Reform Committee is investigating whether Trump is using the presidency for self-enrichment.\n\n\u201cI see the most recent issue as one issue among many issues,\u201d said Rep. Al Green (D-Tex.), who has pushed for Trump\u2019s impeachment for two years, forcing multiple unsuccessful votes on removing Trump over alleged instances of bigotry. \u201cAll of the issues stacked on top of each other constitute a reason for why this issue is receiving the prominence and importance it\u2019s receiving.\u201d\n\nThe past two presidential impeachment processes, involving Richard M. Nixon and Bill Clinton, included votes of the full House authorizing the Judiciary Committee to formally investigate. There are no plans for such a vote now, and it is unclear to what degree Pelosi\u2019s declaration on Tuesday formally changes the House\u2019s posture.\n\nThat is a question likely to be litigated in the courts. The House has already cited the potential for impeachment in a lawsuit filed in July seeking disclosure of grand jury testimony gathered in the course of Mueller\u2019s investigation. The Justice Department opposed that request in a legal brief filed this month that cited inconsistent statements from Pelosi, Nadler, House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) and others regarding whether Democrats were actually pursuing impeachment.\n\nJonathan Turley, a George Washington University constitutional law professor who has been critical of the impeachment push, said Pelosi\u2019s conclusive statement Tuesday could help the House prevail in that case, but said there are \u201cstill glaring contradictions\u201d in the Democratic position.\n\n\u201cIt would be much more convincing if the House was seeking a vote to dedicate this controversy to the Judiciary Committee for an impeachment inquiry,\u201d he said. \u201cThis entire process has been uncomfortably casual \u2014 casual to the point of conversational in terms of the steps taken towards impeachment.\u201d\n\nFor now, House vote or not, the Judiciary Committee will remain in the driver\u2019s seat \u2014 putting Nadler in the role that Rep. Peter W. Rodino (D-N.J.) had with Nixon and Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) with Clinton.\n\nElsewhere in the House Democratic Caucus, there is concern \u2014 if not consternation \u2014 at how the panel has so far handled its investigations, which have largely been stonewalled by the Trump administration. Aside from the July appearance of Mueller, the panel has struggled to focus national attention on Trump\u2019s conduct.\n\nA hearing last week featuring former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski devolved into a partisan exercise mostly notable for Lewandowski\u2019s persistent and occasionally flamboyant refusals to answer Democratic questions. That changed during the hearing\u2019s final moments, when a committee lawyer succeeded in getting Lewandowski to confirm allegations of potential obstruction by the president.\n\nThe relationship between Pelosi, a longtime impeachment skeptic, and Nadler has been tense in recent weeks, as the chairman urged the speaker to embrace impeachment proceedings. For months Pelosi refused, even as she signed off on the committee\u2019s work and legal arguments suggesting that an impeachment inquiry was already underway.\n\nSome members, in private conversations, urged Pelosi to find a more significant role for Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), the leader of the Intelligence panel based on his committee\u2019s jurisdiction of the intelligence matters at the center of the allegations about Trump and on his comparatively measured approach toward impeachment over the past months. Those private discussions, stretching from the weekend into Monday evening, prompted Pelosi to sound out members on what they thought about the idea.\n\nA prominent leader of moderate Democrats, Rep. Stephanie Murphy of Florida, publicly backed the appointment of a select committee Tuesday \u201cto immediately investigate abuse of executive power,\u201d comparing it to the special Senate committee empaneled during Watergate.\n\nBut there was significant skepticism among liberal members, as well as among outside activist groups, that appointing a new committee would amount to anything more than a delaying tactic. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) tweeted on Tuesday morning that Democrats \u201cdon\u2019t have the luxury of time\u201d to set up another panel.\n\n\u201cJudiciary has been investigating& putting the pieces together for months,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez wrote. \u201cImpeachment belongs there. We must honor jurisdiction, historical precedent,& work done + allow Judiciary to move forward.\u201d\n\nPaul Kane contributed to this report.\n\nRead more at PowerPost", "description": "Unanswered in the speaker\u2019s announcement: How sweeping will the investigation be?
