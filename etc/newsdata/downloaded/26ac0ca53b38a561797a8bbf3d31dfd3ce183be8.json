But a new study shows the subtle ways our long-lasting partnership has moulded the noggins of our dogs. Different breeds have slightly different brains from one another, the study found \u2014 differences that seem to be linked not just to the shape and size of the breed, but also the specific behaviours they were bred for.\n\nLead researcher Erin Hecht, an assistant professor in the department of human evolutionary biology at Harvard University, had been interested in studying dogs as a window into the evolution of brains for years, dating back to her grad school days. But it wasn\u2019t until she collaborated with Marc Kent, a veterinary neurologist at the University of Georgia at Athens, that she got her wish.\n\n\u201cThis might sound a little goofy, but it\u2019s also profound \u2014 our brains have been shaping the brains of another species.\u201d\n\nKent provided Hecht with a treasure trove of brain scans taken from good boys and girls who had gotten an MRI but turned out to have no neurological problems. With these scans, Hecht\u2019s team was able to closely compare the brains of 62 purebred dogs from 33 different breeds. What they found might seem obvious at first glance, but it highlights how tethered dogs have become to humankind.\n\n\u201cOur basic finding is that different breeds of dogs have different brain anatomy,\u201d Hecht told Gizmodo by phone. The team\u2019s findings were published Monday in the Journal of Neuroscience.\n\nTo anyone who ever watched a pug valiantly trying to play in the park with dogs twice his weight and height, that shouldn\u2019t be too surprising a result. But the differences the team found go beyond a dog\u2019s physical dimensions.\n\n\u201cThat was kinda my first reaction too \u2014 they have different bodies, of course they have different brains. But really, nobody has looked at this before. Which is kind of astounding,\u201d Hecht said. \u201cAnd so what we found was that the differences in brain anatomy go over and above differences in body size, brain size, and just general head shape. And we think these differences are accounted for by the selective breeding of behaviours.\u201d\n\nSome of the subtle differences in brain anatomy spotted by Hecht and her team.

And when the team compared these dogs to other breeds, they appeared to have key differences in brain regions linked to coordination, eye movement, and spatial navigation \u2014 everything you\u2019d need to be a good tracker.\n\nAccording to Hecht, these findings illustrate the complex ways that brains, including our own, evolve over time. They also suggest that we could use neuroscience someday to continue refining the specialised tasks we breed and train dogs for, such as rescue work or therapy work. More philosophically though, they show just unique how our relationship with dogs really is.\n\n\u201cThis might sound a little goofy, but it\u2019s also profound \u2014 our brains have been shaping the brains of another species,\u201d Hecht said.\n\nHecht and her team next plan to focus on the brains of dogs that aren\u2019t just bred to be good at something but are still working hard at it, such as border collies competing at herding championships.", "description": "As humans have gone, so have their canine companions.
