Not since John Major\u2019s days has a government removed the whip from MPs over a vote on Europe, and back then they at least limited it to one. Last night, 21 men and women\u2019s careers in the Tory party were brought to an abrupt end.\n\nBut that, perhaps, wasn\u2019t the most telling part of the evening. One anecdote doing the rounds this morning is the story of how, late on, Jeremy Corbyn was challenged by an excitable bystander in Portcullis House, who shouted at him \u201cCome on Jeremy, let\u2019s do this election, don\u2019t be scared!\u2019\n\nThere was no aggression in the man\u2019s voice or demeanor; The Times\u2019 Tim Shipman, in fact, relays that he was positively boisterous, in good spirits. Which, given Dominic Cummings\u2019 government had just lost its majority and a crucial vote, is all the more peculiar of him.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut for Cummings, this is all part of the plan. Not a grand strategy with one preordained Brexit outcome, as many like to think. But a broad plan with multiple possible outcomes which stretch beyond leaving the EU, all of which work in his favour.\n\nCummings, you see, does not like the Tory party. Perhaps that\u2019s why he felt so bold as to start talking to the leader of the opposition \u2013 on this, at least, they are kindred spirits. He isn\u2019t Boris Johnson\u2019s spin doctor because of any affinity for the man, or those he represents. He has no time for Tory grandees and entitlement.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. \u2018Brexit is like...\u2019 The Top 20 Twitter analogies Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

They understand that the problem in British politics is not Brussels, but the Tories themselves.\n\nThey understand that the party, the most electorally successful in the world, which Peter Hitchens has described as existing purely to keep power \u201cfor the sons of gentlemen\u201d, rather than representing people, needs to be reformed, preferably completely rebuilt from the ground up. It is an attitude that Corbynistas share about their own party, after decades under the thumb of Blairism.\n\nIndeed, it was an accusation often levelled at Corbyn and his companions that they cared rather more about root-and-branch reform and control of the party than they did about governing. The way that concerted efforts were made, repeatedly, to deselect, bully and isolate MPs, it was said, would cost Labour the support and goodwill, not to mention the numbers, needed to form a majority.\n\nThe Tory party can\u2019t completely change its nature overnight. Where Labour harries those it wants gone, the Tories use the knife. It\u2019s quicker. But never have they done so on such a scale before. Two former chancellors, several former ministers, even Churchill\u2019s grandson (which for many conservatives was, for some reason, an achievement) have gone. With them will go votes, seats and support. And Cummings is jumping around Portcullis House delighted.\n\nThe MPs that have gone, and several more who will almost certainly follow, may well have been doing what they believed to be right. But to many prospective voters, they represented everything that they disliked about the party and Westminster more broadly.\n\nThey were entitled, they were arrogant, and, whatever your thoughts on Brexit, they were elected as members of a party that pledged to see it through, but who used their positions to push a Bill that would prevent it.\n\nThe message, now, has been made very clear. The Conservative Party is no longer open to europhiles or moderates. It has planted its flag firmly in the sand as the marker for a hard-right horizon. This new leadership is gambling on permanently shifting political faultlines to see it back into power when that election comes \u2014 but even if it fails, they will have taken back control of the party, if nothing else, and that will have been worth it all.", "description": "Last night\u2019s drama in the corridors of the Palace of Westminster will go down as a particularly infamous event.
