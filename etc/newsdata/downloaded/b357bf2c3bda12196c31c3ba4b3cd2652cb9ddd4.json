The NSCPCC advises: Babies, toddlers and very young children should never be left alone\n\nChildren under the age of 12 are rarely mature enough to cope in an emergency and should not be left at home alone for a long period of time\n\nChildren under the age of 16 should not be left alone overnight\n\nParents and carers can be prosecuted for neglect if it is judged that they placed a child at risk by leaving them at home alone\n\nA child should never be left at home alone if they do not feel comfortable with this, regardless of their age\n\nIf a child has additional needs, these should be considered when leaving them at home alone or with an older sibling\n\nWhen leaving a younger child with an older sibling think about what may happen if they were to have a falling out - would they both be safe?\n\nHowever, Dr Jennisen said: 'The level of neglect is really the same whether a child knowingly left home alone is injured or not.\n\n'And such situations should be handled the same by child protective investigators.'\n\nDespite their being no law, parents in the UK can be fined or sent to prison if they are judged to have placed a child at risk of harm by leaving them home alone.\n\nNeglect can include failure to provide supervision to a degree which harms a child's safety, according to US Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nAn NSPCC spokesman said: 'There's such a variation in the rate that children mature that it would be difficult to come up with a \"one size fits all\" rule.\n\n'Instead, in the UK the choice is left to parents who know their children best and can use their own judgement about when best to leave a child.\n\n'Children under the age of 12 are rarely mature enough to cope in an emergency and should not be left at home alone for a long period of time.\n\n'Needless to say, babies, toddlers and very young children should never be left alone.'\n\nStudies have shown that 40 per cent of paediatric injury-related deaths in the US are due to a lack of adult supervision, the authors said.\n\nIn the UK, more than two million children under the age of 15 are taken to A&E for an accident in the home every year.\n\nDr Gerene Denning, emeritus research scientist at the University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, said: 'This study recognizes that there are critical connections between safety laws, advocates and professionals in child welfare, and families with small children.\n\n'It takes partnership between all of these to prevent childhood injuries.'\n\nThe research is being presented at the American Academy of Pediatrics 2019 National Conference & Exhibition in New Orleans and has not been published.", "description": "Half said it should be illegal for a 12-year-old to be left home alone for hours and 11 per cent said it was neglect.
