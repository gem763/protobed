King could only smile and agree.\n\nBut we would all do well to watch King \u2013 in anything. At 48, she is in her prime. While filming Watchmen, King won the best supporting actress Oscar for If Beale Street Could Talk, based on the James Baldwin novel. For years, she has been turning out quietly devastating portraits \u2013 in the movies Jerry Maguire and Ray, in the TV show Southland \u2013 with little public recognition. Now she has her pick of roles. \u201cI appreciate winning the Oscar,\u201d she says, \u201cbut that\u2019s not the ultimate goal. I should be able to use it as currency moving forward.\u201d\n\nKing was not familiar with the original Watchmen material, nor the 2009 Zack Snyder movie (her 23-year-old son Ian is more excited about this role than any of King\u2019s previous parts). But once she read the script, she was enthused. In Damon Lindelof\u2019s adaptation, the tale\u2019s 1950s cold-war storyline is spun into a look at the rise of a white supremacist group in a parallel US. King plays Angela Abar, a cop with superhuman fighting skills and an amazing French Lieutenant\u2019s Woman-style cape: not the kind of part she usually gets.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Veiled threat \u2026 King as the superhero in Watchmen. Photograph: AP\n\nKing, who in a New York hotel room is slight and smiling, powers through the series like a wrecking ball. She tuned into the fantasy landscape pretty quickly, even quibbling with wardrobe over the practicality of each costume. Originally, her mask was so cumbersome it seemed to defy even the tenuous reality of a comic-book tale. \u201cI was like, \u2018This is not good for the superhero peripheral! I can\u2019t see if something\u2019s coming \u2013 you have to tell me!\u2019 So our wardrobe designer had a great idea: what if it was painted on?\u201d It was hell on her skin, but it\u2019s dynamite on screen.\n\nLindelof was co-creator of Lost and the recent HBO hit The Leftovers. Watchmen has that same compelling narrative, the story of men with bamboo torches trying to eliminate black people. In the current climate, this parallel America feels very like the real thing. One of Lindelof\u2019s triggers, says King, was Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019s 2014 article for the Atlantic, The Case for Reparations, addressing the unacknowledged fall-out from slavery. She also cites \u201cthe way policing is happening here in the States with, particularly, black men.\u201d\n\nTo this end, Watchmen is, oddly, of a piece with Beale Street, Baldwin\u2019s expos\u00e9 of the split-screen reality in the US between white people and people of colour \u2013 although Watchmen doesn\u2019t seem expressly political to King. With a laugh, she says: \u201cBeing black, it\u2019s part of my life. What\u2019s happened is that Trump has just emboldened people. They were always there, feeling the way they\u2019ve been feeling, but now, oh my gosh. There are a lot of people \u2013 white friends I have \u2013 who have had this wedge in their families. They knew maybe a family member was a little less progressive, but whoa! Now they\u2019re finding out their views were so far apart.\u201d\n\nTrump has just emboldened people. They were always there, feeling the way they\u2019ve been feeling, but now, oh my gosh\n\nMeanwhile, the idea of white supremacy as a guerrilla force is not exactly fantastical, given the extent such militias play in US history. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to pretend that something didn\u2019t exist if you\u2019re not talking about it,\u201d says King. \u201cWithin our community, yes, we\u2019re talking about it all the time, because we\u2019re living it generation to generation. But for a lot of white Americans, ignorance is bliss. For them.\u201d\n\nKing grew up in California, and wanted to be a dentist. This was not a passing phase. She loved going to her dentist so much, it seemed for many years to be the only possible career path. \u201cI would always hear horror stories about the dentist, but not mine. His dental assistant was his wife, Babe, and she had this white hair that looked like cotton candy. I always looked forward to going. I\u2019d floss to impress him. He made the experience fun. He made me understand how important your periodontal situation is.\u201d She bursts out laughing. \u201cHe had a great set of teeth and Babe had a great set of teeth! So whenever I would see people without a great set of teeth I\u2019d be like, \u2018Ew!\u2019\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t ever live in Britain, I say. \u201cYeah, I know.\u201d Again she hoots with laughter. \u201cNot a lot of good teeth there.\u201d\n\nKing had acted in school, but it wasn\u2019t until she got to theUniversity of Southern California that it became clear to her not only that dental work wasn\u2019t in her future, but that what she should do was drop out to act. It amazes her now that she made this decision with \u201cno information to back it up\u201d. She simply knew it was the right thing to do, a strong intuition foreshadowing a steeliness that would become apparent 30 years later in her most famous roles. Her parents weren\u2019t happy. \u201cMy mom is a teacher and showed her disappointment,\u201d she says, \u201cbut not enough that it made me decide to go back.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Quiet marvel \u2026 King giving her Oscar-winning turn in If Beale Street Could Talk. Photograph: Annapurna Pictures/Allstar\n\nShe was so young and inexperienced that for years, in roles she took in movies such as Boyz N the Hood and Mighty Joe Young, she had no idea of pay scale, or whether she was receiving a fair income relative to others on set. \u201cI wasn\u2019t focused on that,\u201d she says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I was in my 30s that I even stopped to consider the wage gap. It was something as simple as hearing a male actor say something \u2013 either about his per diem, or something else \u2013 and I was like, \u2018Wait! Hold up \u2013 my part is way bigger than yours.\u2019\u201d No one talked about it in the early days? \u201cWell, things have been designed so that we don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nKing has been a supporter of Time\u2019s Up, the campaign to equalise pay and conditions for women in Hollywood. \u201cThat\u2019s why this is a pretty exciting time. If I\u2019m blessed enough to have a granddaughter, she\u2019ll come in knowing this is how it\u2019s going to be. I feel like it\u2019s diminishing it by calling it a movement. It\u2019s witnessing a shift, a life change. That\u2019s how I look at it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to convince people there is an audience that wants quiet stories\n\nCrucially, she says, expectations have changed: there\u2019s a suspicion that, just as sexual harassment will come back to bite you, so will pay differences. \u201cNo one wants their filthy past, their dirty little secret, to come out. A lot of people in these positions of power \u2013 white men \u2013 don\u2019t even realise it was a problem, or something you should feel embarrassed about.\u201d\n\nKing is glad she had a lot of solid success before she won the Oscar, playing supporting roles in big movies. \u201cI\u2019ve heard people say, \u2018Oh, you were robbed with Jerry Maguire, or Ray.\u2019 But I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve had an appreciation for the art, in the way I do, if it had happened earlier.\u201d\n\nBeale Street was a different experience. \u201cOh, gosh,\u201d says King, who found it so personal that talking about it still makes her emotional. Astonishingly, it was the first movie adaptation of a Baldwin novel, a film that remained a quiet, literary piece despite the starriness of its cast \u2013 and of its director, Barry Jenkins, fresh from his Oscar win for Moonlight the previous year. For King, who played Sharon Rivers, the mother of a young woman whose fiance is wrongly imprisoned for rape, it was everything: a love story, an indictment of the criminal justice system, and part of the vast, untold history of black life in the US. \u201cWe\u2019re in a time when film is so loud and the audience is looking for shocking. It\u2019s hard to convince people that there is an audience out there that wants quiet stories.\u201d\n\nBeing in her 40s, she says, brings a confidence to go against the grain. She has started her own production company, vowing to staff all her projects with a minimum of 50% women. King wonders if she should have kept quiet about that, since she now gets asked about it every five minutes \u2013 and she has hardly hired anybody yet. \u201cBut at the end of the day, it\u2019s holding my feet to the fire.\u201d\n\nBeale Street's Regina King: 'Awards season is like a new full-time job!' Read more\n\nSo does she feel in her prime? \u201cFor the most part, body-wise, I don\u2019t feel different than when I was in my 20s,\u201d she says. \u201cOnly when I hurt something, because it takes so long to get back. But the wisdom and regard for what\u2019s important is different now. In my 20s, that I-don\u2019t-give-a-fuck attitude is great. It helps you go out on a ledge and let your feet dangle down and not even think about it.\u201d\n\nStill, it is nothing compared with the thrill of having better judgment: \u201cBeing in your 40s and having the wherewithal to know, \u2018Yeah, maybe not that ledge.\u2019\u201d She roars with laughter.\n\n\u2022 Watchmen is on HBO in the US from 20 October and on Sky Atlantic and Now TV in the UK from 21 October.", "description": "The Oscar-winner is playing a cape-swishing superhero in HBO\u2019s revamp of the epic comic book.
