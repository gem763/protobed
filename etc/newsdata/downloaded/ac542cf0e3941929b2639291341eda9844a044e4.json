One of his songs is called I Might Vote 4 Trump, while on his typically experimental new album, All My Heroes Are Cornballs, he raps, as a black man, about wanting to be adopted by Madonna and merrily drinking the tears of \u201crednecks\u201d.\n\nBut the fact he does all this over ugly, uneven beats, built around thick waves of distortion and screaming synths, means Hendricks could just as easily be categorised as punk rock as hip-hop. Free the Frail, one of his new LP\u2019s standout tracks, speaks directly to punk\u2019s anti-capitalist values, as Hendricks claims: \u201cI don\u2019t rely on the strength of my image\u201d.\n\nBack in the 1980s, rap and punk were both genres that got frowned upon by the elite just for being what they were \u2013 JPEGMAFIA, aka Barrington Hendricks\n\nIn Barcelona, as dozens of teenagers enthusiastically bang heads to songs with subversive titles such as I Cannot Wait Until Morrissey Dies and Digital Blackface, it\u2019s easy to draw a parallel between Hendricks and the bold onstage personas of legendary anti-establishment acts like The Sex Pistols or The Clash, artists who also knew how to channel youthful angst into something euphoric and liberating.\n\nHendricks is happy to indulge in the comparison. \u201cBack in the early 1980s when rappers couldn\u2019t perform in the fancy venues because the police were too racist and scared, it was the punk venues letting them in to perform,\u201d he tells BBC Culture. \u201cI guess race was the big thing separating [rap and punk] in the general public eye, but they were both resilient genres that got [frowned upon] by the elite just for being what they were. They gave a home to outsiders. I [have] always felt like they were just the same thing, but both wrapped up in a different way.\u201d\n\nGrowing up, he explains, he was equally enthusiastic about political rappers like Ice Cube and Chuck D as hardcore punk bands like Bad Brains and Fear. \u201cI saw Fear perform live at a young age, so I guess you could say I draw from that same energy.\u201d\n\nModern punk heroes\n\nToday, JPEGMAFIA is one of dozens of young rappers and rap acts drawing heavily from the DIY ethos of punk rock to create music to be moshed to. The likes of Death Grips, Run The Jewels, Denzel Curry, Danny Brown, Sheck Wes, Rico Nasty, Ski Mask The Slump God, and Travis Scott (who was arrested back in 2017 after the police accused him of inciting a riot at one of his shows) perform with the same transgressive vigour of 1970s punk icons. When Sheck Wes plays the stirring Mo Bamba live, it recalls the renegade firecracker spirit of Nirvana\u2019s iconic Smells Like Teen Spirit video.\n\nIn the UK, snarling Northampton rapper Slowthai thrillingly struts around the stage like a modern-day Sid Vicious. He blasts what he sees as the toxicity of Brexit Britain in a way that\u2019s pure punk provocation. It\u2019s no surprise, for example, that he carried around a fake severed head of Prime Minister Boris Johnson during his performance at last month\u2019s Mercury Prize amid ugly beats inspired just as much by Gang of Four as Dizzee Rascal. His punk-ish rap peers include Scarlxrd and Master Peace. On the other hand, you could also point to the hip-hop influence of lo-fi British punk bands like Idles and Sleaford Mods as a sign of the convergence between the two genres.\n\nProlific Long Island producer Kenny Beats, real name Kenneth Blume III, has worked with many of the aforementioned artists, helping shape the punk-rap sound that\u2019s currently ruling the underground. He believes the fact more and more rap artists are gaining a penchant for primal screaming and ugly production is simply a reflection of our times. \u201cThe other month I played a show just 24 hours after there were two mass shootings here in America,\u201d he says. \u201cThe planet is literally on fire, so what more can an artist like Rico Nasty do but scream? It\u2019s instinctual to rappers at this particular moment. It\u2019s how they process the world.\u201d He says he\u2019s currently producing a record for hardcore punk band Trash Talk \u201cthat's pure thrash with no electronic drums, but that way of working isn\u2019t too dissimilar from when I work with JPEGMAFIA or Slowthai.\u201d\n\nA 21st-Century protest\n\nIn this age of social media, where people fire off snarky political opinions every couple of seconds, Kenny believes that anti-establishment protest music can have trouble cutting through. To have a real impact, it\u2019s less about what you say than how you say it. \u201cYou need to make people think about society in a less literal and more primal way,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s about using the least amount of sounds to make the most amount of noise and energy, and making a bass stab really feel like you\u2019ve been punched in the face. A lot of the rap I produce really has that kind of punk essence. When I work with JPEGMAFIA he asks me for the worst beat possible as I guess a rapper that makes something that\u2019s raw and ugly and chaotic is definitely going to stand out and feel more human right now, because things aren\u2019t pretty out there.\u201d\n\nRico Nasty, real name Maria Kelly, is a 22-year-old Maryland rapper every bit as enigmatic and hell-raising live as JPEGMAFIA \u2013 the fact she\u2019s pushing similar buttons as a woman makes her, arguably, even more important. On songs like Bitch I\u2019m Nasty and Rage, which are both produced by Kenny Beats, who also guided the music on her most recent album Anger Management, Kelly attacks the gnarly guitars and cutting drums with real venom, every word delivered like she\u2019s face-to-face with her worst enemy. Sometimes she just starts screaming in between bars.\n\nI\u2019ll see straight guys moshing with the gay guys and I love that \u2013 Rico Nasty, aka Maria Kelly\n\nEvoking the DC comic book character Harley Quinn, her bold onstage look is about reclaiming the colours white female punk artists wore before her and showing her fans, many of whom feel like outsiders, that they can be anything they want to be. It\u2019s quietly revolutionary.\n\n\u201cIf you come to a Rico Nasty show you\u2019ll see all kinds of people, dancing together as one in the mosh pit,\u201d she explains. \u201cI\u2019ll see straight guys moshing with the gay guys and I love that. A lot of these people aren\u2019t able to let out their anger in the real world without being demonised, particularly black women, but they can at my show and to my songs. It\u2019s a safe space to let out all the rage, and that\u2019s healthy. It\u2019s like group therapy.\u201d\n\nIn a world with infinite choice, thanks to streaming platforms such as Spotify and Apple Music, Kelly believes fans expect more from their favourite artists \u2013 because, if their interest palls, they can quickly move on to something else. By embodying the fearless punk values of her hero Joan Jett, she can ensure she lives up to their estimations, she says. \u201cThey gotta see me go crazy on stage or I\u2019m not doing my job! it's all about showing emotions because they paid good money to see you and they don\u2019t want to just see me stand still. You\u2019re the person who made their favourite song so you should be performing until your voice cracks [like the punk artists voices\u2019 used to do].\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s something Hendricks very much agrees with. Punk in the 1970s was a reaction to the overly conceptual progressive rock that bands like Pink Floyd and Genesis were releasing. The Sex Pistols\u2019 two-minute songs, which used a minimal amount of chords played as shoddily as possible, were in stark contrast to the stadium rock that some young people found pretentious.\n\nSimilarly, Hendricks believes the reason rap with punk sensibilities resonates right now is because the melodic \u2018trap\u2019 sound that has dominated the radio for so long is also starting to become stale. Hip-hop fans could be looking for something to counter the neatly produced club trap anthems by stars like Drake and Migos, which means music that\u2019s more unhinged and doesn\u2019t read from a script, and artists who enjoy giving their all on stage and are comfortable making people feel, well, uncomfortable.\n\n\u201cSo much of rap sounds the same, and that\u2019s okay, but that means some people want something that can be the complete opposite too. We\u2019re entering an era where you have to leave a part of yourself on the stage and really make the crowd move. People aren\u2019t going to just accept your presence or you miming to a song; you have to really do your job, you know? Maybe that\u2019s where [punk-rap] comes in. I feel like this is the only time this sound really has a chance to break through into the mainstream.\u201d\n\nTwo genres united\n\nBut if punk-rap makes sense for this particular cultural moment, it\u2019s hardly a new phenomenon. As John Robb, the author of Punk Rock: An Oral History \u2013 and a rock legend in his own right as lead vocalist in post-punk band The Membranes \u2013 points out, rap and punk first became intertwined in the 1980s, a time when The Clash experimented with a rap edge on The Magnificent Seven.\n\nHe believes Public Enemy were the first band to really bring the two different audiences together, with their rough, hard-hitting boom-bap sound resonating with both black kids in the inner cities and white kids in the suburbs. The fact that, in the 1980s, iconic producer Rick Rubin would split his time between producing new albums for hip-hop acts like Run DMC and The Beastie Boys and hardcore bands like Slayer and The Cult, also helped to create links between the two cultures.\n\n\u201cPublic Enemy were really the first band to resonate with both camps,\u201d says Robb. \u201cChuck D was a huge fan of The Clash and I know from speaking with him, he studied all of the punk bands. I saw them on the Anthrax tour and Public Enemy blew this hardcore band right off the stage. I\u2019m sure every white punk fan in the audience became a rap fan after that.\u201d\n\nThese kids live in such a distorted world that the music is lying if it isn\u2019t distorted as well \u2013 John Robb\n\nAs the 1990s arrived, hip-hop\u2019s punk sensibility was further enforced by in-your-face acts like Ice Cube, DMX, Onyx, and Rage Against the Machine. Then, although he\u2019s easy to mock now, Atlanta rapper Lil Jon also spliced genres to innovative effect with \u2018crunk\u2019, his southern rap take on punk, which prioritised uncomfortably loud horns and repetitive screams. It\u2019s no surprise that Denzel Curry, one of punk-rap\u2019s most prominent artists, channelled Lil Jon\u2019s trademark \u201cwhat\u201d screams on his 2018 song SUMO | ZUMO. \u201cLil Jon was definitely a pioneer for some of the punk-rap acts we see now,\u201d agrees Kenny Beats. \u201cHe showed you could scream on a song and still have a hit on the radio. He even sampled [US heavy metal guitarist] Randy Rhoads, so it was obvious he knew what he was doing.\u201d\n\nBut Lil Jon was hardly an anti-establishment renegade, more just someone who found a sound that stood out from the norm. It was around a decade ago that punk-rap really returned with a vengeance, via authentic anarchist acts like Tyler the Creator\u2019s Odd Future collective. The Los Angeles group weren\u2019t afraid to release incendiary singles where hooks were built around calls to burn schools, among other things, while beats were both manic and minimalist. They lived the punk life they rapped about, hanging out at skate parks and dingy clubs in three-day-old clothes. This DIY spirit made them feel like the black Sex Pistols. And Kanye West borrowed punk elements for his brilliantly bleak 2013 album Yeezus. On it, he took Odd Future-style industrial sonics and made them more palatable for the mainstream, sampling post-punk bands such as Section 25 and offering up riotous tirades like Black Skinhead.\n\nBut Kenny Beats believes one of the most important songs in this new age of punk could be Look At Me by XXXTentacion \u2013 the controversial Florida rapper, real name Jahseh Onfroy, who was shot dead last year at the age of 20, while facing multiple criminal charges. The 2017 song features uncomfortable levels of distortion and unhinged vocals as Onfroy, then just a teenager recording in his bedroom with a cheap microphone bought on eBay, refers to himself as the new Kurt Cobain. Peaking at 34 on the Billboard 100, it was the moment punk-rap showed it could really be a force on the pop charts.\n\n\u201cWhatever you think [about the person and the allegations], there\u2019s no denying Look at Me was one of the most punk-rock moments in a long, long time,\u201d says Kenny Beats, when asked why the song resonates so much with the current generation of rap fans. \u201cYou play it in a room and people are ready to riot. XXX sounds like a scary cult leader rapping over the worst sounding MP3 I\u2019ve ever heard, but everything about that song bottles this idea of being young and not giving a damn. It\u2019s the reason why you hear distorted drums on an Ariana Grande song or people putting out two minute singles. Its influence is everywhere. It doesn\u2019t have a message, but that\u2019s what makes it have one somehow.\u201d\n\nPeople get upset that the old rock \u2018n\u2019 roll attitude doesn\u2019t exist anymore, but it\u2019s right there in front of them \u2013 JPEGMAFIA, aka Barrington Hendricks\n\nAs conversation rages around Brexit, Trump and global warming, there is a feeling among some young people that they are paying for the sins of their parents and have inherited a world that is teetering on the edge. It\u2019s in this context that the darker punk-rap sound has resonated deeply, says Robb. \u201cThese kids live in such a distorted world that the music is lying if it isn\u2019t distorted as well.\u201d\n\nHowever, he\u2019s keen to point out the impact of the internet in making this style of music popular too: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to remember that genre boundaries don\u2019t really exist like they did before. With streaming, every genre cross-pollinates into the next and you just hop from one thing to another. That makes it easier for punk-rap to thrive than it could in the 1980s or 1990s, as back then, everything had to be a hit on a radio. Now, you just put it on Soundcloud and it gets a million views and kids will treat like you like a rock star.\u201d\n\nSo often, Hendricks says, he reads \u201clazy\u201d articles from white music journalists speculating when guitar-driven punk is going to make a comeback and \u201csave music\u201d. Yet he believes this is a blinkered question founded in racism \u2013 critics are unwilling to acknowledge that punk never went anywhere, but its spirit is now embodied by hip-hop, and phallic guitars have been replaced by dusty 808 drums.\n\n\u201c[Rock music] is stagnant, yet here we are in 2019 still clinging on to this old idea of what rock \u2018n\u2019 roll is. People get upset that the old attitude doesn\u2019t exist anymore, but it\u2019s right there in front of them: we\u2019re the new rock stars\u201d.\n\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called The Essential List.
