It is expected that staff will use Kojensi Gov for secure collaboration with external government and non-government agencies.\n\nArchtis said AGD will also offer it as a service to future Royal Commissions.\n\n\"We are excited to welcome the Attorney General's Department as our first government department user of Kojensi Gov after a successful beta program,\" Archtis CEO and executive director Daniel Lai said.\n\n\"Securing such a high profile organisation clearly demonstrates the utility of our platform in enhancing the security of sensitive information.\"\n\nThe contract was facilitated through the Digital Transformation Agency's (DTA) Digital Marketplace.\n\nSee also: Why collaboration platforms create major security risks for organisations (TechRepublic)\n\nThe Digital Marketplace has been touted by the agency as being a \"simple, open platform that brings government buyers and digital sellers together\".\n\nIn attempting to spread the AU$6.5 billion spent annually on IT by the Australian government, the marketplace aims to simplify procurement processes and make it easier for businesses of all sizes to access government contracts.\n\nAs of August 2019, the marketplace has seen AU$718 million worth of contracts be made across 2,150 opportunities.\n\nThe AGD contract, expected to generate revenue of AU$30,000 annually, comes after the company secured another 12-month deal with the Department of Home Affairs (DHA) in July.\n\nThe DHA contract sees Archtis extend its professional consulting services and IT strategic advisory contract, with Lai saying the contract validates the company's expertise in IT and security, and demonstrates the strength of its relationship with the federal government.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\nCommonwealth pushes public cloud by default\n\nSpruiking a public cloud-first approach, the Australian government has lifted the lid off its new Secure Cloud Strategy.\n\nBiometrics, CDR, broadband tax: All the Bills Canberra wants to reheat in 2019\n\nThe federal government hopes to have its identity-matching framework, the Consumer Data Right, and a handful of other legislation passed by the end of the year.\n\nAustralian Signals Directorate launches open source data visualisation tool\n\nASD touts Constellation as a data analysis application enabling data access, federation, and manipulation activities across large and complex datasets.\n\nQuantum cybers land in Vault Cloud thanks to QuintessenceLabs\n\nThe offering has been touted as the world's first secure and scalable package for enterprise file synchronisation and sharing systems.\n\nWhy Australia is quickly developing a technology-based human rights problem (TechRepublic)\n\nHuman rights advocates have called on the Australian government to protect the rights of all in an era of change, saying tech should serve humanity, not exclude the most vulnerable members of society.", "description": "First government client of the company's Kojensi Gov 'content and collaboration' cloud service.", "authors": ["Asha Barbaschow"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/04/05/ebb87ff9-14b6-4a39-a906-ad4a7a5b31b9/thumbnail/770x578/86b08ccc4b13f4540a38a8da69decf4a/istock-625736338.jpg"}
