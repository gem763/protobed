The equipment was not returned to Huawei, and the Chinese technology giant filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Commerce Department, as well as several other government agencies, in June.\n\nThe seizure was in relation to whether the gear required a specific license to be shipped back to China. Huawei contended that it did not.\n\nIn August, nearly two years after the gear was seized, Huawei said it was informed by the U.S. government that no export license was required to ship the equipment back to China. The Chinese telephone-equipment maker said the gear had been returned. As such, the Chinese firm dropped the case.\n\n\"After a prolonged and unexplained seizure, Huawei has decided to drop the case after the US government returned the equipment, which Huawei views as a tacit admission that the seizure itself was unlawful and arbitrary,\" Huawei said in a press release on Tuesday.", "description": "In September 2017, U.S. authorities confiscated Huawei gear which was on its way back to China from California.
