Half of those models will be fully electric.\n\n\"We expect to experience a steep growth curve up to 2025, with sales of our electrified vehicles set to increase by an average of 30% every year. We believe that sustainable mobility thrives wherever there is an effective combination of three factors:\n\n\"Customer demand, legislation and innovative partnerships such as the EVRT Africa. It is vital that the public and private sector continue to cooperate to introduce smarter mobility solutions in South Africa.\"\n\nAccording to Brian Hastie, Network Development Director at Jaguar Land Rover for South Africa and sub-Saharan Africa the country is well-positioned for mass electric vehicle adoption. \"This road trip will highlight the recent strides made by various stakeholders, including Jaguar South Africa, in infrastructure development and product availability.\n\n\"The I-Pace was introduced early this year and this platform is a great way to show a broader audience how I-Pace customers are already successfully living with electric vehicles and existing infrastructure in urban environments and on long-distance journeys.
