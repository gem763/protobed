In addition, all second hand information that proved to be so inaccurate that there may not have even been somebody else, a leaker or spy, feeding it to him or her? A partisan operative? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2019\n\nThe complaint, Trump wrote, was \u201call second hand information that proved to be so inaccurate that there may not have even been somebody else, a leaker or spy, feeding it to him or her?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis is an unsubtle and obvious effort to encourage his supporters to adopt this new line of argument. It\u2019s secondhand! It\u2019s inaccurate! How can this be used to criticize Trump?\n\nThe answer is simple. While much of what the complaint includes is indeed secondhand or based on news reporting, those are hardly disqualifying. The news reports are mostly citations of Trump\u2019s mentions of the situation with Ukraine or references to Trump-friendly articles at the Hill. And those secondhand assertions in the complaint (read them here) that can currently be verified have been verified \u2014 by White House comments or in the rough transcript (read it here) of the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nHere is what the whistleblower complaint says about that call compared to what the transcript itself says. Again: You can verify this yourself at the above links.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCOMPLAINT: \"Multiple White House officials with direct knowledge of the call informed me that, after an initial exchange of pleasantries, the President used the remainder of the call to advance his personal interests.\u201d\n\nTRANSCRIPT: Trump speaks in nine discrete segments.\n\nHe congratulates Zelensky on winning the presidency. He says Ukraine is happy Zelensky won. He mentions how much aid the United States provides to Ukraine. He asks a favor: Investigate (baseless) rumors about Ukrainian involvement in an assessment of Russia\u2019s hacking of the Democratic National Committee in 2016. He encourages working with his attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani and pushes for an investigation of former vice president Joe Biden and his son. He says he\u2019ll have Giuliani and Attorney General William P. Barr call about the investigation. He invites Zelensky to the White House. He says he\u2019ll see Zelensky at the White House or at an event in Poland (that he ended up not attending). He again offers his congratulations.\n\nExcept for the invitation to the White House \u2014 though even that is questionable \u2014 the whistleblower\u2019s allegation is accurate.\n\nCOMPLAINT: \u201cAccording to the White House officials who had direct knowledge of the call, the President pressured Mr. Zelensky to \u2026 initiate or continue an investigation into the activities of former Vice President Joseph Biden and his son, Hunter Biden \u2026\"\n\nTRANSCRIPT: Trump says, \"[T]here\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it \u2026 It sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCOMPLAINT: \u201c \u2026 assist in purportedly uncovering that allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election originated in Ukraine, with a specific request that the Ukrainian leader locate and turn over servers used by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and examined by the U.S. cyber security firm Crowdstrike, which initially reported that Russian hackers had penetrated the DNC\u2019s networks in 2016 \u2026\"\n\nTRANSCRIPT: Trump says, \u201cI would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike \u2026 I guess you have one of your wealthy people \u2026 The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation.\u201d (Ellipses in the original.)\n\nCOMPLAINT: \u201c \u2026 and meet or speak with two people the President named explicitly as his personal envoys on these matters, Mr. Giuliani and Attorney General Barr, to whom the President referred multiple times in tandem.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTRANSCRIPT: Trump praises Giuliani at one point, saying \u201c[h]e was the mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I would like him to call you. I will ask him to call you along with the Attorney General. Rudy very much knows what\u2019s happening, and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him that would be great.\u201d\n\nAt another point he says he \u201cwill have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to [have] Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it.\u201d At another point he says he \u201cwill tell Rudy and Attorney General Barr to call.\u201d\n\nCOMPLAINT: \u201cThe President also praised Ukraine\u2019s Prosecutor General, Mr. Yuriy Lutsenko, and suggested that Mr. Zelensky might want to keep him in his position.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTRANSCRIPT: Trump talks about a prosecutor, but it\u2019s not clear whether he\u2019s referring to Viktor Shokin \u2014 whom Biden fought to get fired \u2014 or Shokin\u2019s replacement, Lutsenko. Lutsenko, it\u2019s worth noting, had helped propagate anti-Biden stories through the Hill.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI heard you had a prosecutor who was very good,\u201d Trump told Zelensky, \u201cand he was shut down and that\u2019s really unfair. A lot of people are talking about that, the way they shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad people involved.\u201d\n\n\u201cI heard the prosecutor was treated very badly,\u201d he said at another point, \u201cand he was a very fair prosecutor so good luck with everything.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBy the time of this call, Giuliani and Lutsenko had met personally on multiple occasions, according to the whistleblower.\n\nCOMPLAINT: \u201cAside from the above-mentioned \u2018cases\u2019 purportedly dealing with the Biden family and the 2016 U.S. election, I was told by White House officials that no other \u2018cases\u2019 were discussed.\u201d\n\nTRANSCRIPT: The only other issue raised in the call was the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, whom Trump removed. That subject was raised by Zelensky.\n\nAD\n\nThose are all of the mentions of the call itself in the whistleblower complaint \u2014 all clearly and directly verified by the transcript that Trump\u2019s White House itself released.\n\nWhat has garnered more attention over the past 24 hours is another assertion made in the complaint.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhite House officials told me that they were \u2018directed\u2019 by White House lawyers to remove the electronic transcript from the computer system in which such transcripts are typically stored for coordination, finalization, and distribution to Cabinet-level officials,\u201d the whistleblower writes. \u201cInstead, the transcript was loaded into a separate electronic system that is otherwise used to store and handle classified information of an especially sensitive nature. One White House official described this act as an abuse of this electronic system because the call did not contain anything remotely sensitive from a national security perspective.\u201d\n\nOn Friday morning, the White House provided a statement to CNN: That move did happen, at the request of National Security Council lawyers.\n\nIt\u2019s sounding more and more as if the so-called whistleblower is just as credible as the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general and a subsequent review by the Office of Legal Counsel determined him or her to be.\n\nAD", "description": "Evidence for its validity comes from Trump's own team.", "authors": ["Philip Bump", "National Correspondent Focused Largely On The Numbers Behind Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/rz1wXDNrzaUdMh0pE4s7eUTS_J4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7OINNRCOC5AFXAM74LCVRCUHAA", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
