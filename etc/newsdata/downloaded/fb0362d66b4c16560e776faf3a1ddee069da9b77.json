No alarm is going off. But the instant Mark Alizart opens his eyes in the morning, his dog is right there, licking his hand. It\u2019s not even as if the dog \u2013 a two-year old, black-and-white, curly-haired Spanish water dog \u2013 sleeps in the same room. But as soon as the human is awake, the dog is too. His alarm goes off. It\u2019s the kind of thing Jung referred to as \u201csynchronicity\u201d, two hearts beating as one: a collective unconscious or brain fusion. And, says Alizart in his revelatory new book, Dogs, this is just what has occurred in the course of our evolution: \u201cEverything indicates that we have one brain between us, that our brain is never complete unless it is paired with a dog\u2019s.\u201d\n\nAlizart\u2019s previous dog, a beagle, was called \u201cMartin Luther\u201d (he/they wrote a book about how Reformation theologians have influenced modernity). But the dog died when he was only six months old of a mystery virus. Anyone who has lost a dog will understand \u2013 and it\u2019s worse when it\u2019s a young dog, a pup, struck down in his prime \u2013 Alizart was in mourning for a year, paralysed by grief, surrounded by pictures of his late dog. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find relief in books or films, only in looking at other dogs.\u201d At least Martin Luther (the theologian rather than the dog) thought that dogs would go to heaven: \u201cThou too in resurrection shall have a little golden tail,\u201d he said to his dog T\u00f6lpel.\n\nAlizart was brought up in London and had fancied becoming the next Stephen Hawking. But he failed miserably at his science exams. So he moved to Paris and went to the Lyc\u00e9e Henri IV. This time he failed in philosophy. He was a failure in both English and French. \u201cI failed everything,\u201d he says, disarmingly. Somehow he ended up working in contemporary art \u2013 only artists would have him. And a dog. The dog didn\u2019t mind if he was a failure. And then he lost the dog. So he resolved to write a book about dogs, to fill the void that threatened to consume him.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

You\u2019d be better off looking at videos on YouTube. This is a book about the meaning of dogs. It\u2019s the \u201cDog Vinci Code\u201d, explaining exactly why dogs secretly rule the world. You think it\u2019s a coincidence that \u201cdog\u201d is \u201cgod\u201d spelled backwards? Don\u2019t forget Anubis. This is the dog as philosopher and seer (or, at least, sniffer). It is no coincidence that his current dog is called Master Eckhart, named after the great medieval mystic.\n\nWe met at the British Library, Alizart and I, because as Groucho Marx rightly said: \u201cOutside of a dog, a book is man\u2019s best friend: inside of a dog it\u2019s too dark to read.\u201d Our dogs stayed home. I just hoped Waffle (my dog) was being good for a change: he generally wreaks revenge for being left behind. \u201cDogs definitely feel guilt,\u201d Alizart says. \u201cIf you do, they do. When I watch my dog I can actually see him thinking about it sometimes: shall I or shan\u2019t I make a lunge for that tasty titbit? I can see it in his eyes: he knows.\u201d I\u2019m not sure Waffle even pauses to consider: he\u2019s a remorseless scavenger, hoovering the world clean of scraps, always on the alert for a stray chicken bone (the bane of London streets).\n\nWho would have a dog? It\u2019s the kind of question that gets asked after your dog has just chewed up your favourite cushion or made a mess of your rug or got into yet another fight with a passing spaniel (or is having a shot at humping him). Why do I even have a dog? If you pause to consider this longer than it takes Waffle to wolf down a sandwich he has just stolen from picnickers in the park, you might conclude something like the following: the dog is a \u201chappy imbecile\u201d. You get to enjoy the joy, the irrepressible enthusiasm, of the dog. The dog effortlessly achieves that semi-sacred zen-like state that eludes most of us most of the time, of living \u201cfor the moment\u201d, in the present, immune to nostalgia and hope, unencumbered by too many distracting thoughts.\n\nThe dog effortlessly achieves that semi-sacred zen-like state that eludes most of us most of the time, of living \u2018for the moment\u2019\n\nBut you\u2019d be wrong. It\u2019s true, dogs don\u2019t worry too much about taxes, although if you worry, they worry. But, says Alizart, they are \u201cthe masters of time\u201d. Whereas we are governed mainly by the visual and aural senses, they are governed by the olfactory. They have bigger noses, in the main (or, as I once heard this described, \u201cgreat nasal architecture\u201d). But the point about having a sensitive nose that is usually close to the ground and snorting up pungent scents of all kinds (I\u2019m not sure there is a \u201cgross\u201d for dogs), is that you (the dog) are conscious of the past, of who passed by here not so long ago, leaving a trace. Every scent is like a clue. A bloodhound (or Lassie or Rin Tin Tin) on the trail of some miscreant or hunting for the missing owner of a sock is reconstructing a crime in his head.\n\nLikewise, the dog is always up for the next thing (be it walk or dinner or someone coming home). No one who has seen a dog mourning the passing of a human or another dog (or, yes, even a cat) can say that a dog is invariably content with the present and the way things are right now. If they are capable of even more pleasure than we would normally have chasing after an old tennis ball, conversely they are also capable of more pain. Sadly, they are not immune to hopes and fears and memories.\n\nI think my father kept a dog (always a boxer dog) mainly in order to have conversations (admittedly, mainly one-way) with Bruno or Brutus. The dog would listen patiently, sometimes cocking his head to one side in concentration. The response was not necessarily audible, but it didn\u2019t matter because my father (towards the end of his life) couldn\u2019t hear that much anyway. So what are we doing when we talk to dogs?\n\nWe are basically talking to ourselves, says the dog behaviourist (specialist in \u201ccanine cognition\u201d) Alexandra Horowitz, in Our Dogs, Ourselves. There is something like a prohibition on talking to ourselves in public, at least. Isn\u2019t it a sign of madness? But the dog gives you an excuse for getting your thoughts out there, even if it\u2019s only the eternally hopeful \u201cGood boy!\u201d or \u201cYou don\u2019t know when to behave, do you, laddie boy?\u201d (me to Waffle, earlier) or (to quote some of the lines Horowitz has recorded in New York), \u201cYou had better stay your bottom right here, sunshine\u201d and \u201cI see you doing weird stuff. Cut it out.\u201d\n\nLike someone suffering from a \u2018phantom limb\u2019, there is a dog-shaped hole in our hearts (or our minds) when the dog is not there\n\nAs she very reasonably argues we shouldn\u2019t be seen \u2013 despite the letter of the law \u2013 as \u201cowning\u201d our dogs. They are too independently minded for that. We have responsibility for them, yes. And we should clean up after them too, no argument there (I have bags in my pocket right now). But it cannot be right for a divorce judge to say (as one in fact does), that seeking custody rights of Barney, a rescue dog, is equivalent to \u201ca visitation schedule for a table or a lamp\u201d.\n\nMaybe it would be truer to say that it\u2019s the other way around and dogs own us. They are the great manipulators. We are an integral part of their environment. And just as a dog will go round and round, shuffling and nosing to get a comfy cushion just right (even though they can equally well curl up on a wooden floor), so too they try to lick us into shape, a shape that suits them. We don\u2019t train them, they train us \u2013 to do their bidding. Having said that, I have to allow that, in exchange for a few minutes of excitement every day, a dog is willing (rather like a koala up a tree or a hibernating bear) to snooze through long periods of inertia and nothing-much-happening.\n\nObviously, when I walk down the street with Waffle, he is attached to me, I am attached to him. But more generally we are beings in search of an attachment. Or, as the philosopher Donna Haraway suggests in her Companion Species Manifesto, we are \u201cprosthetic\u201d beings. We require extensions and accessories (which may well explain our dependence on the phone). Like someone suffering from a \u201cphantom limb\u201d, there is a dog-shaped hole in our hearts (or our minds) when the dog is not there. I, for one, suffer from dog envy if I\u2019m travelling without a dog.\n\nOur association \u2013 our collaboration \u2013 with dogs goes back to the Neolithic, when some wolves found it better to try to get along with Homo sapiens rather than eat them, and we realised it was fun to have them around. We have developed a symbiotic relationship. Now we can register the best friend as an \u201cemotional support dog\u201d (and thereby take the dog on a plane, so long as they sit on your lap). What Alizart shows is that, over the aeons, human brains and dog brains have converged and evolved in tandem. We have a dog brain, just as the dog has a human brain.\n\nThis is not as crazy as it sounds. Consider, for example, the \u201ccynegetic paradigm\u201d \u2013 so called by the Italian historian Carlo Ginzburg, who traces a continuum between hunter-gatherers tracking a hairy mammoth, Sherlock Holmes picking up clues to Moriarty, Freud analysing mental states, and a dog following a scent. We are all following a trail: dogs just have their noses lower to the ground. There is a wonderful thriller by Robert Crais, Suspect, in which a wounded cop and an injured German shepherd provide a crutch to one another \u2013 and together solve a crime.\n\nIt was Freud who came up with one of the best answers to the question of why we are capable of loving a dog with such intensity: \u201c[for their] affection without ambivalence, the simplicity of life free from the almost unbearable conflicts of civilisation, the beauty of an existence complete in itself.\u201d The dog saves us from too much culture. But the dog is also saving us from our own nature. Paradoxically, the dog has humanised us, softening the worst of our vicious instincts. Alizart mentions the Chinese legend of a dog bringing seeds to humanity on his coat and thus kick-starting agriculture. The tragedy is that we have visited upon the dog some of our own stupid obsessions.\n\nFunction has given way to fashion. Weird genetic experimentation and inbreeding has produced dogs that are sick from the very beginning of their short and unhealthy lives. Dogs don\u2019t worry about what you look like, only what you smell like (and they don\u2019t demand Chanel either). But somehow we managed to inflict our own preoccupation with mere appearance on them. Alizart reckons this goes back as far as the 17th century, when humans moved out of the country to the city and took their dogs with them but didn\u2019t give them a proper job to do. Maybe the labradoodle (and other hybrids) can save the dog.\n\nAlizart is not that into cats. \u201cI don\u2019t want to revive the war between cats and dogs. Cats tolerate us. That\u2019s very different. Dogs put a leg or two into our world.\u201d He says that \u201cdogs are nature\u2019s communists\u201d. I don\u2019t know how good Waffle would be about sharing his dinner \u2013 not very I suspect \u2013 but he is very willing to share his life with me, to \u201cband together\u201d. Excluding writing, a dog will generally have a go at whatever you\u2019re doing. I\u2019ve known one very good surfing dog, better at riding a wave than most humans (having four legs is a distinct advantage).\n\nNot all dogs like getting wet of course. I remember one old dog of mine who always steered scrupulously around puddles and when it came to bath time became a quivering wreck. I never tried him on a surfboard. He\u2019d probably have been happier doing what I know a friend of mine is doing: going for a 3k run with her dog. Maybe we learned jogging from dogs.\n\nI know a woman who recently tried putting her husband in the dog\u2019s crate. Or rather, he got in there of his own accord. He could just about squeeze in. She helped him out by closing the door. He didn\u2019t mind. It was cosy and comforting. Snoopy dreamed of being a First World War fighter ace. Who has not seen a dog curled up fast asleep in a basket or den or hogging the sofa and thought: I want to be a dog?\n\nAndy Martin is the author of \u2018With Child: Lee Child and the Readers of Jack Reacher\u2019 (Polity)", "description": "He makes no noise and no movement.
