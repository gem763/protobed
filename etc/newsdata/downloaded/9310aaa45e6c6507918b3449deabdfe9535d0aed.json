The advance-decline is inclined towards sellers. In the following article, I am presenting two stocks which are looking very bearish on charts and are good short selling opportunities.\n\nAurobindo Pharma\n\nThis pharma stock is one of the weakest stocks in the entire Nifty50 basket. I have been maintaining a bearish stance in this stock for the last many months and we have been rewarded every time a sell call is initiated.\n\nThe stock has been witnessing a strong selling pressure and huge volumes traded in the counter indicate strong hands exiting the counter. On monthly charts, the stock has formed a bearish, Triple Top pattern, which further signifies a forthcoming sell-off in the counter.\n\nThe immediate support for the stock stands at 434/- below which the counter may again witness a strong surge in supply.\n\nMy outlook for the stock in Short Term & Medium Term is NEGATIVE.\n\nTechnical Pattern: Triple Top ( Monthly)\n\nBHEL\n\nBHEL is one stock that has repeatedly lost buyers' interest and is a good bet for shorters.\n\nA detailed look at the daily charts shows a weak trend in the counter which is largely favored for bears. The stock is trading in a negative price channel for the last 6-7 months indicating the lack of participation of strong buyers. Major fall in the counter in the stock is again supported by huge volume reflecting the fact that strong hands are exiting the counter.\n\nA further rise in OBV supports the weakening trend in the counter. The stock is also trading below major support levels 50 SMA/20 SMA, indicating the long term perseverance of bears.\n\nMy outlook for the stock in Short Term & Medium Term is Negative. Fresh shorts may be initiated in this counter if the stock breaks the support of 42 levels. The stock may slide up to 10-15% below this support zone.\n\nTechnical Pattern: Negative Price Channel\n\nThe above analysis is based on closing prices as on 11th October, 2019 & Trading levels mentioned in the post are valid upto 1 month\n\nDisclaimer: All views expressed in this site are for reference only.
