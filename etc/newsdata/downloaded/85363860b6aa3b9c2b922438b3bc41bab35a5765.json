REUTERS/Stephen Lam - HP1EF9A1EM211\n\n\u201cWhen you press the shutter button it takes one long exposure, and then in just one second the neural engine analyzes the fused combination of long and short images, picking the best among them, selecting all the pixels, and pixel by pixel, going through 24 million pixels to optimize for detail and low noise,\u201d Schiller said, describing a feature called \u201cDeep Fusion\u201d that will ship later this fall.\n\nIt was the kind of technical digression that, in years past, might have been reserved for design chief Jony Ive\u2019s narration of a precision aluminum milling process to produce the iPhone\u2019s clean lines. But in this case, Schiller, the company\u2019s most enthusiastic photographer, was heaping his highest praise on custom silicon and artificial intelligence software.\n\nThe technology industry\u2019s battleground for smartphone cameras has moved inside the phone, where sophisticated artificial intelligence software and special chips play a major role in how a phone\u2019s photos look.\n\n\u201cCameras and displays sell phones,\u201d said Julie Ask, vice president and principal analyst at Forrester.\n\nApple added a third lens to the iPhone 11 Pro model, matching the three-camera setup of rivals like Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], already a feature on their flagship models.\n\nBut Apple also played catch-up inside the phone, with some features such as \u201cnight mode,\u201d a setting designed to make low-light photos look better. Apple will add that mode to its new phones when they ship on Sept. 20, but Huawei and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google Pixel have had similar features since last year.\n\nIn making photos look better, Apple is trying to gain an advantage by way of the custom chip that powers its phone. During the iPhone 11 Pro launch, executives spent more time talking its processor - dubbed the A13 Bionic - than the specs of the newly added lens.\n\nA special portion of that chip called the \u201cneural engine,\u201d which is reserved for artificial intelligence tasks, aims to help the iPhone take better, sharper pictures in challenging lighting situations.\n\nSamsung and Huawei also design custom chips for their phones, and even Google has custom \u201cVisual Core\u201d silicon that helps with its Pixel\u2019s photography tasks.\n\nRyan Reith, the program vice president for research firm IDC\u2019s mobile device tracking program, said that has created an expensive game in which only phone makers with enough resources to create custom chips and software can afford to invest in custom camera systems that set their devices apart.\n\nEven very cheap handsets now feature two and three cameras on the back of the phone, he said, but it is the chips and software that play a huge role in whether the resulting images look stunning or so-so.\n\n\u201cOwning the stack today in smartphones and chipsets is more important than it\u2019s ever been, because the outside of the phone is commodities,\u201d Reith said.\n\nThe custom chips and software powering the new camera system take years to develop. But in Apple\u2019s case, the research and development work could prove useful later in products such as augmented reality glasses, which many industry experts believe Apple has under development.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all being built up for the bigger story down the line - augmented reality, starting in phones and eventually other products,\u201d Reith said.", "description": "When Apple Inc introduced its triple-camera iPhone this week, marketing chief Phil Schiller waxed on about the device's ability to create the perfect photograph by weaving it together with eight separate exposures captured before the main shot, a feat of \"computational photography mad science.\"", "authors": ["Stephen Nellis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429035829&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B0S5", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
