Some thunderstorms have them, but most don't.\n\n(Image: Hung-Hsi Chang)\n\n\u201cThese mysterious bursts of light in the upper atmosphere momentarily resemble gigantic jellyfish.\u201d\n\nRed sprites are electrical bursts of light that often occur above thunderstorms.\n\nAs their name suggests, red sprites appear red at higher altitudes, but fade to blue at lower heights.\n\nNASA added: \u201cOne unusual feature of sprites is that they are relatively cold - they operate more like long fluorescent light tubes than hot compact light bulbs.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n\u201cIn general, red sprites take only a fraction of a second to occur and are best seen when powerful thunderstorms are visible from the side.\u201d\n\nThis isn't the first time that NASA has featured a photo of lightning as its Astronomy Picture of the Day.\n\nLast month, the space agency featured a beautiful lightning display captured by photogrpher Hung-Hsi Chang on board a plane travelling from Munich to Singapore.", "description": "The photo, which was snapped by photographer Stephanie Vetter, has been featured as NASA\u2019s Astronomy Picture of the Day", "authors": ["Shivali Best", "Image", "Stephane Vetter", "Twan", "Hung-Hsi Chang"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20536219.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SpritesHD_Vetter_1000.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
