Today, however, ETH has surged over 5% and is now nearing the $180 region.\n\nThis upwards momentum has come about as the aggregated crypto markets recovered from a sharp drop that occurred overnight, and analysts are now eyeing significantly further upside for ETH in the near-term.\n\nEthereum Surges Towards $180 as Buyers Flex Their Strength\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading up nearly 6% at its current price of $178.70, which marks a significant recovery from its recent lows of roughly $165 that were set yesterday concurrently with the downturn incurred by the aggregated crypto markets.\n\nEthereum\u2019s current upwards momentum is showing few signs of slowing down, and it has been able to outperform Bitcoin over the past 24-hours, which may signal that its near-term price action will remain separate from that of Bitcoin \u2013 assuming that BTC continues expressing stability around its current price levels.\n\nThe latest ETH surge did not come as a surprise to analysts, as HornHairs, a popular cryptocurrency analyst on Twitter, explained in a tweet from yesterday that he suspects that Ethereum will continue climbing higher in the near-term.\n\n\u201c$ETH #Ethereum: Bullish 1W SFP at a confluent level. If I was a gamblin\u2019 man, I\u2019d bet she goes up from here,\u201d he said while pointing to the chart below that shows that ETH found strong support at its lower support boundary, which could mean that a surge to its upper boundary at $350 is imminent.\n\n$ETH #Ethereum Bullish 1W SFP at a confluent level.
