One prominent finance chief at a major tech firm Yahoo Finance recently spoke with says more discussions are cropping up among key clients about delaying contracts amid yawning trade uncertainty. Further, the source says more companies it partners with are starting to look for ways to cut costs to counteract cautiousness among their own book of business.\n\nThat sounds like hiring plans among big companies could increasingly stall into year end.\n\nSecondarily, the market may view a lackluster September jobs report \u2014 think sub-100,000 on the headline non-farm payrolls number \u2014 as the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate cuts being unable to arrest the growing effects of a trade war with China. Remember, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average continue to trade near record highs on the belief the Fed\u2019s cheap money spigot will save the economic day in the face of cooling job growth and Trump impeachment concerns.\n\nAfter all, there is unlikely any other near-term catalyst besides the Fed to jumpstart a slowing labor market. The U.S. manufacturing sector is in recession. Consumer confidence has softened, which could weigh on the holiday spending plans of many shoppers. And the Trump administration doesn\u2019t appear anywhere near a trade truce with China.\n\n\u201cIf that print is below 100,000, I would think the knee-jerk reaction on that is that they are going to start selling stocks and buying bonds. I think that would be a risk-off move,\u201d acting Wells Fargo chief economist Jay Bryson said on Yahoo Finance\u2019s The First Trade.\n\nTo be sure, most on Wall Street aren\u2019t expecting much from the September jobs report after a disappointing August showing. That in and of itself begs the question if the stock market is overdue for a correction. The consensus estimate on the Street is around 125,000 jobs having been created in September.\n\nNEW YORK, NEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 18: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on September 18, 2019 in New York City.

July\u2019s employment figures were revised down by 5,000, underscoring how the effects of the trade war are gaining momentum.\n\n\u201cIn our view, mounting downside risks from slowing global growth, depressed business sentiment, trade policy and other geopolitical uncertainties argue for more Fed easing than the policymakers projected in the September dot plot, where even the most dovish participants expected only one more rate cut over the forecast horizon,\u201d cautions Deutsche Bank U.S. economist Brett Ryan.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
