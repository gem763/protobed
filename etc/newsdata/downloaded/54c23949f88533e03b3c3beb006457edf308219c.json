Hanging over this year\u2019s gathering was a central, disturbing question: What if? What if Democrats are doomed to lose here yet again in 2020?\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very worried about this election,\u201d said U.S. Rep. Donna Shalala (D-Fla.). \u201cWe have to inspire people and they have to get out and vote. We have the votes to win Florida but we have to turn out.\u201d\n\nFlorida is ground zero for Trump\u2019s re-election, and for Democrats it seems like an eternity since former President Barack Obama forged a winning coalition to win the state twice.\n\nTrump won Florida in 2016 with less than half of the popular vote, edging out Democrat Hillary Clinton by fewer than 113,000 votes of 9.4 million cast. It was an agonizing defeat that Democrats re-lived again in 2018, when gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis, a Republican, defeated Democrat Andrew Gillum by only 32,463 votes.\n\nWith their razor-thin losses racking up, Democratic leaders are trying to shake the party\u2019s lather-rinse-repeat cycle. Election Day is more than a year away, but they\u2019ve already ramped up voter registration efforts, boosted outreach to Hispanics, and started a \u201cvoter protection\u201d team of volunteer lawyers ready to go into battle. During one panel this weekend, lawyers working with the party urged county party members to check ballot designs, which some suspect might have cost Democrats votes in Broward County.\n\n\u201cWe have learned our lesson,\u201d said Juan Pe\u00f1alosa, executive director of the Florida Democratic Party.\n\nThe party is spending $3.2 million on voter registration, a basic element of successful campaigns or, as one Democratic consultant put it, \u201cblocking and tackling.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe party is kind of getting back to our roots,\u201d said Pe\u00f1alosa. \u201cThat\u2019s focusing on voter registration, building neighborhood teams, precinct captains, expanding our base, and not waiting until we have a candidate.\u201d\n\nStill, skepticism was evident at this weekend\u2019s gathering. During one training session, activists asked how to motivate voters demoralized by recent losses. In the past two governor\u2019s races, voters cast 14.1 million ballots; Democrats lost by a collective 96,608 votes.\n\nIn 2018, when Gillum fell to DeSantis, Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, the state party\u2019s longtime leader, lost to now-Sen. Rick Scott by about 10,000 votes, triggering a recount and legal battles. Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried was the only Democrat to take statewide office that year, winning by a 6,753 vote margin.\n\nA year before Obama\u2019s 2012 win in Florida, the party registered 60,000 voters. In the year leading up to the 2016 election, they registered 11,000, and just 7,000 a year before the 2018 election.\n\n\u201cWe know how 2016 and 2018 went,\u201d Pe\u00f1alosa said.\n\nSo far this year, Republican have registered about 1,000 more voters than Democrats, but state Democrats contend that they\u2019ve taken a slight advantage since they launched their voter registration campaign in early June.\n\nSince then, Democrats have registered nearly 900 more voters than Republicans, according to voter registration numbers posted by state officials.\n\nIt\u2019s about learning from past mistakes, including timing, said Florida Democratic Party chair Terrie Rizzo.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one reason we are doing what we are doing now, why we are building programs now,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you look around the room, there\u2019s actually tremendous enthusiasm.\u201d\n\nAnother pitfall of recent cycles has been Hispanic outreach. The Hispanic vote has been a persistent problem for Florida Democrats and helped Scott rack up a 3-0 record. Older Cuban-Americans turn out in high numbers for Republicans while younger Cubans and non-Cuban Hispanics who skew Democratic are less likely to vote.\n\n\u201cWe have a lack of Spanish-speaking surrogates for media in the Florida Democratic Party,\u201d Pe\u00f1alosa said. \u201cWe have had a concerted effort to kind of train up Spanish speaking media surrogates.\u201d\n\nThe party has added a Spanish-language communications staffer, and of the 31 organizers in targeted areas of the state, half speak Spanish, Creole, or both.\n\nWhile Florida Democrats have united to build their 2020 election infrastructure, they\u2019re divided over whether a progressive or moderate presidential nominee can do more to help the party\u2019s chances.\n\n\u201cWe are going to have to create space for people who voted for Barack Obama once or twice and then voted for Trump,\u201d said Steve Schale, a political strategist who helmed Obama\u2019s state campaign in 2008 and is now backing Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nThat means making inroads in Republican-dominated counties so they don\u2019t deliver huge margins for Trump.\n\n\u201cWe are not going to win in Florida if we lose Pasco County by 50,000 votes again,\u201d Schale said.\n\nBiden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren had the biggest presence at this weekend\u2019s convention. Both had staff on the ground, noticeable supporter presence, and raucous rallies in the conventional hall on Saturday afternoon\n\nThe Biden team believes a candidate seen as too far to the left will turn off non-progressive Democrats. Warren supporters say Floridians want a progressive candidate who could excite those voters and motivate them to turn out.\n\nTo make their point, Warren\u2019s camp points to Gillum\u2019s 2018 campaign. Gillum ran as a progressive during both the primary and general elections, besting Gwen Graham, a former Democratic congresswoman and party favorite, and almost taking the governor\u2019s mansion.\n\n\u201cBernie [Sanders] laid the groundwork in 2016. He did not do as well as many wanted, but the groundwork was laid,\u201d said Jody Young, lead volunteer coordinator for Warren\u2019s Florida campaign. \u201cGillum certainly surprised a lot of people.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was working for Gwen at the time,\u201d Young said. \u201cThey just out-hustled us. He laid more groundwork for progressives.\u201d\n\nChristian Ulvert, a South Florida Democratic consultant, said his party recognizes its recent missteps. But he warned that Democrats can\u2019t wait for their candidate to be nominated to before they push back on Republican\u2019s \u201csocialist\u201d branding of the party.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to turn it up a notch or two,\u201d he said. \u201c2020 is right around the corner.\u201d", "description": "The festivities weren\u2019t enough to dispel a sense of unease that has gripped Florida Democrats as President Donald Trump ramps up his bid for re-election.", "authors": ["Gary Fineout", "Matt Dixon"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/fb/3f/7c1bcb9746559c791f024d96b3e3/171020-dems-2008-gty-1160.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
