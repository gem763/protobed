The condition, characterized by an unhealthy obsession with the New York congresswoman and an inability to stop foaming at the mouth, claimed reporters at the Washington Times this week. On Wednesday, the conservative outlet published an \u201cEXCLUSIVE\u201d story, headlined \u201cSelf-declared socialist AOC splurges on high-dollar hairdo.\u201d\n\nIn actual fact, as the internet swiftly pointed out, Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s $80 cut and $180 coloring were not actually that \u201chigh-dollar\u201d. Women\u2019s haircuts are incredibly expensive. Being a woman is incredibly expensive. Dunno if you\u2019ve heard of this little thing called the \u201cpink tax\u201d?\n\nWhat\u2019s more, spending money on a haircut is not incompatible with being a socialist. Conservatives seem to think that if you want to tax billionaires and make the world a more equitable place you ought to live in a dirt hut and refuse to participate in modern society. Last year, for example, a reporter for the Washington Examiner tried to insinuate that AOC was a hypocrite by posting a photo of her wearing a nice jacket and coat. The subtext being that you can\u2019t call yourself a real socialist unless you dress in rags.\n\nWhile conservatives crow about self-declared socialists getting haircuts they are rather more tight-lipped about the Trump administration\u2019s spending habits. Indeed, AOC responded to HairGate by tweeting a story about Mike Pence spending almost $600,000 in limo service for an unnecessary detour to Trump\u2019s Irish resort in Doonbeg. You know, the one that was 181 miles away from Pence\u2019s meetings in Dublin.\n\n\u201cMike Pence used *taxpayer funds* - not personal ones - to spend several thousand haircuts\u2019 worth of public money on a visit to Trump golf courses,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. \u201cI wonder if Republicans care about corruption as much as they care about a woman\u2019s cut & color.\u201d I think we all know the answer to that question.\n\nThe to-do about AOC\u2019s \u2019do isn\u2019t just yet another example of Republican hypocrisy, however. It\u2019s also a depressing reminder that being a woman means being forced to walk an impossible tightrope everyday. You\u2019re criticized if you don\u2019t look good, but you\u2019re also criticized if you look too good. You\u2019re either a slut or a prude. You\u2019re told to lean in and speak up at work, but you\u2019re called a bossy bitch if you speak up too much. Women simply can\u2019t win when they play by the patriarchy\u2019s rules. Which is why we need to stop playing by the patriarchy\u2019s rules and lean all the way out.\n\nExclusive: new AOC scandals revealed\n\nThis constant stream of AOC \u201ccontroversies\u201d is getting incredibly tedious. So, you know what? I\u2019m going to save the rightwing media some time and write a few preemptive headlines for them:\n\n\u00b7 Bloody hypocrite! Supposed socialist AOC uses luxury tampons rather than stuffing leaves in her underwear\n\n\u00b7 HOT AIR: Ocasio-Cortez wants Green New Deal but caught shamelessly using heating during the winter\n\n\u00b7 Call yourself a commie? AOC buys NEW PHONE rather than contacting people via free-range carrier pigeon\n\n\u00b7 REVEALED: Ocasio-Cortez eats at a RESTAURANT instead of foraging for edible plants in DC parkland\n\nElizabeth Warren has a punchline for that\n\nAt Thursday\u2019s LGBTQ town hall, Warren was asked what she\u2019d say if a supporter told her they believed \u201cmarriage was between one man and one woman\u201d. Warren replied: \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to assume it\u2019s a guy who said that. And I\u2019m going to say, then just marry one woman. I\u2019m cool with that. Assuming you can find one.\u201d\n\nChris Cuomo does not have a good punchline for that\n\n\u201cMy pronouns are she, her and hers,\u201d Kamala Harris said after being introduced to stage at Thursday\u2019s LGBTQ town hall. CNN host Chris Cuomo immediately quipped \u201cMine too.\u201d This was neither funny nor clever and didn\u2019t go down well with a lot of people, particularly in the trans community. Cuomo later apologized.\n\nIranian women allowed to watch soccer\n\nWomen have largely been banned from attending football matches in Iran since the Islamic revolution in 1979. On Thursday, however, more than 3,000 women were allowed to sit in a segregated part of a Tehran stadium to watch Iran take on Cambodia. Iran has been under international pressure to relax its ban on women watching sports after Sahar Khodayari set herself on fire and died following her arrest for trying to enter a stadium.\n\nMistreatment of women during childbirth\n\nMore than one-third of women in Nigeria, Myanmar, Ghana and Guinea were physically and emotionally abused during childbirth in health centers, according to a new study published in the Lancet medical journal. Health officials say women around the world, including in developing countries, are mistreated during childbirth, with most abuse occurring in the 15 minutes before and during childbirth.\n\nMatt Lauer\u2019s rape denial \u2018a case study in victim-blaming\u2019\n\nBrooke Nevils, a former NBC News employee who alleges Lauer raped her in 2014, has spoken out after the former NBC Today show host published an open letter about the allegations. Lauer claims Nevils was a \u201cwilling partner\u201d. Nevils says he\u2019s trying to bully her into silence.\n\nTeens turn away from makeup\n\nCosmetics spending among female teenagers is the lowest it has been for years, according to Piper Jaffray\u2019s 38th semi-annual Taking Stock With Teens survey.\n\nMo Women in MoMA\n\nNew York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art has just had a $450m renovation. The new MoMA, which opens on 21 October, sees a slight improvement in gender equality. \u201cAt least 28% of the artists on view in the new MoMA \u2026 are women \u2013 about five times the proportion in recent years,\u201d the Wall Street Journal reports. About 59% are male artists and the rest have \u2018no applicable gender\u2019, MoMA says.\u201d\n\nWagatha Christie breaks the internet\n\nIf you\u2019re British then I\u2019m sure you already know everything there is to know about \u201chow Coleen Rooney created the best day on Twitter of all time\u201d. If you\u2019re not British then I suggest you educate yourself about the Insta-scandal immediately. Trust me, it\u2019s worth it.", "description": "Women simply can\u2019t play by the patriarchy\u2019s rules \u2013 which is why we need to stop and lean all the way out", "authors": ["Arwa Mahdawi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/399039651c1b1ceee8f718f568d162dae20d63e2/0_0_5306_3183/master/5306.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=5263d614c7f5fbd110362351fe919999", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
