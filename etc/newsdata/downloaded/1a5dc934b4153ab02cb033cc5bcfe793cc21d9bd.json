We Know Because We Live It.", "language": "en", "text": "Child support wasn\u2019t an issue, because it was never coming. Her soon-to-be former husband had never been good about making the rent, putting food on the table or keeping the lights on. He\u2019d been her high school sweetheart and, when she became pregnant after their graduation in 1979, he had been eager to get married. She was his first and best love.\n\nIt was over now. As the young woman stepped toward the lectern and faced the judge, she straighten the loose dress fabric to hide her fullness. She had come to court that day, at her lawyer\u2019s direction, cloaked by a winter coat and politely answered the judge\u2019s questions. \u201cNo sir, yes sir,\u201d she said, until he was satisfied. Her husband, the father of her daughter, sat quietly as the final order was signed. It was over within minutes. She would get her maiden name, the contents of her tiny apartment and little else.\n\nFor the next several years, she worked in a dental office, rang customers part-time at her father\u2019s gas station and went back to college. She had always been the kind to go to work, double and triple shifts if need be, to provide for her family. By the time her son arrived in July 1986, she was fully on her own, living in a small two-bedroom apartment with bits of used furniture\u2014including a sofa purchased at a salvage sale\u2014and a will to do more.\n\nShe had hidden her pregnancy because, under Missouri law, her divorce could not be granted until after the baby was born. Even then, the statutes allowed for additional hurdles\u2014all deemed necessary to the protection of families. She had endured the unmentionable, addictions and abuse among them, and filed personal bankruptcy to put it all behind her.\n\nI know because Lori Ann is my older sister and eldest living sibling. I would sleep on that couch for weeks until I was shipped off to Marine Corps boot camp. I was there the morning she got dressed and left for the courthouse. Over three decades later, I remember her sense of resolve. She took on each day with a sense of optimism and zeal I will never quite understand. She was 25 then and, dare I say, the bravest woman I had ever known.\n\nUntil Monday night, I had not weighed the significance of it all\u2014 the need to hide a pregnancy from a judge or the fact that I had never encountered a visibly pregnant school teacher in all of my years before graduating high school in 1986. Or even that my own mother, widowed in 1973, did not have a credit card in her own name until 1980 despite having paid every bill she ever had on time. It was simply the world we were used to. A family of women, that son born to my sister in the summer of \u201886 is now the oldest living man in our family.\n\nThe notion that a pregnant New Jersey school teacher would be unceremoniously fired upon administrators learning of her pregnancy comes as no surprise. Not to me. Not in 1971.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, who touts her years in the classroom and her fight to care for young children as she navigated a career, has never been shy about those challenges. She came of age in an era when women were encouraged\u2014 by societal norms or by the lack of legal protection\u2014 to be stay-at-home mothers. For many, including my mother and aunts, this meant little or no access to a college education or a meaningful job at a meaningful wage outside the home. While some took to the streets, burning their bras and demanding equal protection under the law, others\u2014like my mother and sister\u2014simply weathered on.\n\nI am, admittedly, old enough to remember the Equal Rights Amendment. Nearly a decade after the start of the Vietnam War, I was in elementary school when the legislation soared through both congressional houses only to meet its demise when it failed to garner enough state-level support for ratification. Originally authored in 1923, it would take more than five decades to meet House and Senate approval but fell short of the necessary 38 states. It was designed to guarantee equal protection for all Americans\u2014regardless of sex\u2014and sought to end legal distinctions based on gender with respect to divorce, property rights, and employment. Had it been passed, Sen. Warren might still be a public school teacher today. There would have been no need for the Lilly Ledbetter Act or for laws allowing women to take out mortgages and secure credit in their own names. Had it passed, my sister may not have had to wear a winter coat to court in the early spring to hide her pregnancy.", "description": "Child support wasn\u2019t an issue, because it was never coming.
