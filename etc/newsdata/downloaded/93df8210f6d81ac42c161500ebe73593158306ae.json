Speaking of the fan who sent him the image, he added: \"By the time I put it on Twitter, because I was quite taken aback, people were like 'where's it from?' and she managed to send me the link from the campaign for Trump.\"\n\nThe website, which calls itself Conservative News Daily, consists of a page of many people wearing red caps embroidered with \"President Trump 2020 Make America Great.\" It's unclear whether any of the images are actually genuine.\n\nJenkins' tweet has now been liked nearly 63,000 times, retweeted nearly 18,000 times and has garnered more than 2,000 comments.\n\nHowever, not all of the comments have been positive. Some people have criticized him for making light of the situation, while others took the photos so seriously they suggested he should sue Donald Trump.\n\n\"Then it caused that massive controversy for someone like me who's not at all involved in politics let alone American politics,\" Jenkins said. \"I made a joke and I got a good 5,000 americans saying 'how can you say that?' and I was like, oh my god, I didn't think it would go anywhere and now it's this massive political conspiracy.\"\n\nRead more: Love Island is coming to the US \u2014 here's why Brits are so entranced by the debauched reality show\n\nHe said whoever runs the site must have just searched the internet for red hats and used any images Google came up with.\n\nHe has a problem with his photo being used without his consent, he said, but he's mainly concerned about the political connotations.\n\n\"The only thing I could complain about, it's about altering the pictures and making them look like they have a political agenda,\" Jenkins said. \"For example, if that picture had been edited to have Gucci on it, it wouldn't matter would it?\"\n\nHe added that something positive has come from the situation, however, because underneath his viral tweet he posted a link to a PETA campaign about ending the slaughter of dolphins and whales off the coast of Denmark.\n\nThe tweet has been shared nearly 2,000 times, and Jenkins hopes the petition might have garnered the attention of some celebrities to spread the cause further, because otherwise \"I'm just someone from 'Love Island' being told to sue the president of the US. It's a bit of a long shot.\"\n\n\"It's quite funny because I had an audition for a TV show in America and they said 'why do you want to do it?' and I said I would be so good on the show [that] Trump would tweet about me,\" he added. \"And now the Trump campaign has used my face to try and sell hats so it's kind of gone full circle.\"", "description": "Rykard Jenkins didn't know what was going on when someone sent him a picture of himself apparently wearing a red Trump cap.", "authors": ["Lindsay Dodgson"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7f6fd321214c47e82fd7b2-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
