So why is there no scope to delay matches by a couple of days to let Super Typhoon Hagibis do its worst and move on?\n\nIt is entirely the right decision to bring the World Cup to this land. It is a new frontier for rugby and not one person I have spoken to thinks it anything but a fabulous move for the sport.\n\nBut you absolutely have to maintain the credibility of the competition and pulling the plug on a key match in this way absolutely does not.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThere simply had to be greater flexibility for this eventuality written into the schedule.\n\nEngland-France is actually relatively straightforward in at least both teams are already qualified. But what about host nation Japan, due to play Scotland on Sunday in Yokohama?\n\nBoth can still qualify as can Ireland, but not all three. Abandon the fixture and you have to tell Scotland they are out. Sorry. Shut the door, safe flight home.\n\nThere is no way organisers can be seen to give the hosts a free pass into the quarter-finals. It would create an intolerable perception, one it\u2019s hard to see how it would recover from.", "description": "Everyone knows this is typhoon season in Japan.
