The announcement comes after sales of the two models have slowed and after the company had greater-than-anticipated losses in its latest quarterly earnings report.\n\nThe company made the announcement in a Tweet (via TechCrunch), saying that all new orders would come with free unlimited charging at its network of Supercharger stations.\n\nBREAKING: All new Model S and Model X orders now come with \u26a1 free \u26a1 unlimited \u26a1 Supercharging \u26a1 \u2014 Tesla (@Tesla) August 3, 2019\n\nTesla has used free charging as an enticement for new buyers in the past. The perk extended to its Model S and Model X vehicles until 2017 for anyone who purchased a new vehicle. However, CEO Elon Musk had called the program \u201cnot sustainable,\u201d and after January 2017, the company announced that it was restructuring the perk: new drivers would get up to 400 kWh of power a year (about a thousand miles), after which point they\u2019d have to pay. The company has brought the perk out a couple of times: drivers could give their fellow drivers without the perk a referral code that granted them unlimited charging, but that was phased out earlier this year.\n\nNow, the perk appears to be back as a way to help entice drivers to check out its more expensive offerings. At the end of July, Tesla announced its latest set of earnings, in which it revealed that it had lost $408 million in the last quarter. That dip appears to be due to slowing sales for the Model S and Model X, as they\u2019re a more profitable product for the company.", "description": "Tesla announced today that it\u2019s bringing back a useful perk for anyone who buys a new Model S and Model X vehicle: unlimited charging at its supercharger stations.
