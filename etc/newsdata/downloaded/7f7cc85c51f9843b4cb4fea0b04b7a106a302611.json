In 2008, Ms. Chao\u2019s father, James Chao, gave the couple a \u201cgift\u201d of $5 million to $25 million ( politicians are required to report money in ranges, not exact amounts ). Certainly, their wealth has continued to grow.\n\nMr. Chao\u2019s generosity was made possible by the fortune he has amassed through his shipping company, Foremost Group, which has thrived in large part because of its close ties with the Chinese government. In late 1993, Mr. Chao and his son-in-law, Mr. McConnell, traveled to China as guests of the state-owned shipyard conglomerate and military contractor, China State Shipbuilding Corporation . There they met with an old classmate of Mr. Chao\u2019s, the former Chinese president Jiang Zemin.\n\nMr. McConnell\u2019s once hard-line condemnations of China softened in the years to follow. For example, as The New Republic has noted, Mr. McConnell went from telling University of Louisville students that America would never forget Tiananmen Square, in the late 1980s, to hosting the Chinese ambassador at the same school several years later, even as the ambassador publicly defended the regime\u2019s suppression of the Falun Gong.\n\nAll along, the Chaos continued to gain influence. Mr. McConnell\u2019s sister-in-law, Angela Chao, and James Chao sat on the board of the holding company for China State Shipbuilding. While Elaine Chao was secretary of labor under George W. Bush, Foremost Group ordered several enormous cargo ships from a subsidiary of China State Shipbuilding. Secretary Chao and her father also appeared in several tandem interviews with Chinese media, and it at least one, they sit in front of the Department of Transportation\u2019s emblem and alongside images of a book written by Mr. Chao. Today, Angela Chao sits on the board of the Chinese government\u2019s Bank of China.\n\nLast month, the House Oversight and Reform Committee started an investigation into whether Secretary Chao has leveraged her government positions to benefit her family. But so far there is no investigation into Joe and Hunter Biden. Defenders claim there must first be proof that a law was broken to open an investigation. That\u2019s exactly backward. Congress can and should conduct an inquiry to determine whether anything illegal occurred.\n\nThe problem more broadly is that we rely on a hodgepodge of laws that lack the clarity and bright ethical lines found in the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. That needs to change. International bribery laws clearly state that if a person or entity pays a politician\u2019s family member and gets favors in return, it\u2019s an act of bribery; it\u2019s no different from the politician taking the money himself .\n\nObviously, the immediate family members of high-ranking politicians have to work \u2014 no one is saying otherwise. But given their unparalleled access, they should also be required to be transparent about what they are doing.", "description": "We need a Washington Corrupt Practices Act to stop political families from self-dealing.", "authors": ["Peter Schweizer"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/08/opinion/08Schweizer1/08Schweizer1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
