On Wednesday, two Merced County Sheriff\u2019s deputies went to Dol Palos to serve a warrant in a domestic violence case involving a man named Guadalupe Lopez-Herrera. Lopez-Herrera has a history of domestic violence and had pleaded no contest to a charge in January. The Merced Sun-Star describes the case that led to a restraining order against Lopez-Herrera:\n\nThe woman told the court Lopez-Herrera on Jan. 1 threatened to kill her with a kitchen knife. In the request for a restraining order, the woman said Lopez-Herrera then threatened to kill himself. \u201cYou can tell the children that you provoked me to kill myself and it was all your fault,\u201d he is quoted in the court record. The woman said Lopez-Herrera then began slamming his head into a refrigerator. He then approached one of the young children, showed his injuries and said \u201cLook what your mother did to me,\u201d according to court records. The woman described Lopez-Herrera as \u201cvery jealous, controlling, very angry easily.\u201d \u201cHe has strangled me and (threatened) to kill me,\u201d she told the court. The woman went on to say she was \u201cvery scared\u201d her children might be raised \u201cwithout a mother.\u201d\n\nWhen Lopez-Herrera failed to show up for court in August, an arrest warrant was issued. When the two deputies approached his house, Lopez-Herrera opened fire and (allegedly) hit one of the deputies in the chest and the leg. Fortunately, he was wearing a vest and will recover from the wound to his leg. In the chaos, Lopez-Herrera escaped and remained on the run for nearly 24-hours.\n\nAuthorities searched the area but weren\u2019t able to locate him until police spotted the truck he had stolen Thursday morning. That resulted in a high-speed chase and more shots fired at police:\n\nIt sped off, reaching speeds of over 120 mph as other drivers pulled over to give officers room. Herrera led officers from Highway 46 to Highway 41, where an officer used a spike strip to stop him. Even so, he continued to drive, ending along Interstate 5 south of Harris Ranch. At one point, officers say Herrera even fired shots at them through the windshield of the truck.\n\nAt a press conference, Merced Sheriff Van Warnke expressed relief that Lopez-Herrera had been caught but also frustration that he had been unable to turn him over to ICE months ago despite Lopez-Herrera\u2019s long history of violent crimes:\n\n\u201cThis person is not a legal citizen within the United States. We had him in our custody in January of this year. And because of the folks in Sacramento limiting our ability to cooperate with ICE, we could not turn him over,\u201d Merced Sheriff Van Warnke said at a press conference on Thursday\u2026 \u201cBottom line is our immigration policies need to be revamped because we\u2019re gonna continue to have more of this situation happen\u2026We knew ahead of time this guy\u2019s potential for violence was there.\u201d\n\nIn addition to domestic violence, Lopez-Herrera\u2019s rap sheet includes felony assault and assault with a deadly weapon.
