The IPv4 protocol supports IP addresses in the 32-bit format, while the IPv6 supports longer 128-bit addresses.\n\nThe IPv6 protocol was formally approved as an internet standard in 2017, and was designed as a replacement for the IPv4 protocol, which has almost exhausted all its available 4.3-billion address space.\n\nSince IPv6's adoption, ISPs around the world have began rolling out support, along with consumer and enterprise device makers. The rollout has been rather slow, mainly because it's been left at the ISPs' discretion.\n\nBelarus is the first country that makes IPv6 mandatory at the legislative level.", "description": "Starting January 1, 2020, Belarusian ISPs will have to enable IPv6 support for all customer connections.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/03/27/0f4fdb10-98c7-47e5-91d7-c3715ceaa05a/thumbnail/770x578/f96cc2f7a2d3ab8ff28cda3cc118f8a2/crypto-country-exsoviet-state-belarus-us-5c98bb0a2f64e300dd747e3c-1-mar-27-2019-23-23-25-poster.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
