Though the agents eventually agreed to let him go, they insisted on holding onto his phone for nearly two weeks, Khairullah told reporters at a Friday news conference.\n\n\u201cI believe that my constitutional rights were violated,\u201d he said.\n\nThe mayor\u2019s trip had gotten off to a rough start: Four members of his family, including his infant child, were selected for additional screening and searched when they showed up at the airport for their flight to Turkey at the start of July, he said. At Friday\u2019s news conference, Khairullah held up his 14-month-old child\u2019s boarding pass, which had been marked with \u201cSSSS,\u201d for \u201csecondary security screening selection,\u201d according to InsiderNJ.\n\nThe delays meant that they ended up missing their flight and had to rebook, only to be subjected to \u201cextensive\u201d pat-downs when they returned to the airport the next day, the mayor said. When they finally boarded the plane, they were searched for a second time.\n\n\u201cAs a person who travels a lot, I know that is not a normal procedure,\u201d Khairullah said.\n\nKhairullah, who describes himself as \u201cthe American mayor who happens to be a Muslim,\u201d fled Syria with his family in 1980, according to the Bergen Record. They lived in Saudi Arabia before moving to the United States in 1991, when he was a teenager. In 2000, Khairullah became a U.S. citizen. The following year, he ran for office for the first time, and was elected to the borough council for Prospect Park, which is located a little over 20 miles northeast of Manhattan.\n\nOther members of Khairullah\u2019s extended family who fled persecution in Syria ended up in Turkey, which was one of the reasons for his visit this summer. He also took the opportunity to build relationships with local elected officials, he told the Record, and met with the mayors of different towns in between family outings to beaches, historical sites, and famous mosques.\n\n\u201cWe just wanted to go and have a good time,\u201d he said at Friday\u2019s news conference.\n\nOn Aug. 2, Khairullah flew home from Turkey with his wife and four young children. Two CBP officers were waiting at the gate when they landed at John F. Kennedy International Airport, he said. The officers asked everyone on board to take out their green cards and passports. When the mayor handed over his family\u2019s documents, they took a look and then informed him that they wanted to talk. Khairullah said that one of the agents joked about the situation while bringing him to a private room, telling him, \u201cYou know, this way you get past the long lines.\u201d\n\nThough the agent claimed that the process would only take a few minutes, Khairullah ended up spending three hours in custody, he said. At first, the questions seemed routine: The officers wanted to know his name and where he worked, and why he had been in Turkey. But then they turned to more esoteric inquiries, asking him about what he had studied in college, what his mother\u2019s name was, and if he had any nicknames, he told the Record. They also wanted to know if any of the towns he visited were home to terrorist cells, and if he had personally met with any terrorists.\n\nKhairullah, who is also an education supervisor at Passaic County Technical Institute, told reporters on Friday that he was \u201cinsulted\u201d by the question, and asked to contact an attorney.\n\n\u201cAsking me if I knew any terrorists was just flat-out profiling as far as I am concerned,\u201d he said, according to TAPinto Hawthorne, a local news site.\n\nWhile Khairullah didn\u2019t know for certain why he had been detained, he suspected that his past travels could have been a factor. Since becoming mayor in 2006, the 44-year-old has been part of numerous humanitarian missions overseas, delivering food and medical supplies to refugee camps in Syria in addition to raising awareness about the plight of the Rohingya in southeast Asia and traveling to Tunisia to talk about democracy and municipal government.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been interviewed before, and I understand, I travel to Syria, and if there\u2019s anything that I can share with my government, I would,\u201d Khairullah said. \u201cHowever, I don\u2019t go on exploratory missions, I don\u2019t go near shady organizations. I go in, do the job, provide relief, and leave.\u201d\n\nThe agents asked to \u201cglance through\u201d his phone, and Khairullah consented. In a video posted to his YouTube channel, he explained that he didn\u2019t see a problem, since he was confident that there was nothing on there that could be used against him. But after 30 to 45 minutes had passed, he grew frustrated. His children \u2014 ages 1, 2, 9, and 10 \u2014 were getting antsy, and his brother and mother were waiting for him. He asked the agents to give him his phone back and let him go.\n\nAfter patting him down one more time and searching his family\u2019s bags, the officers agreed to release him, but said that they would need to keep his phone. Khairullah said that it took 12 days, and the help of an attorney from the New York chapter of the Council of American Islamic Relations, before he finally managed to get it back. In the meantime, he asked his constituents to contact him on Facebook or email.\n\nThe good news: I am back in the US. The bad news: You can only reach me by FB messenger and email courtesy of US... Posted by Mayor Mohamed T. Khairullah on Friday, August 2, 2019\n\nA spokesperson for CPB told NJ.com on Friday that while federal privacy laws prevent them from commenting on Khairullah\u2019s claims, the agency is \u201ccommitted to preserving the rights and privacy of all people while conducting necessary and lawful actions to secure our border.\u201d All international travelers entering the country are subject to inspection, the official added, and for a \u201cminuscule\u201d number of travelers, that may include a search of their electronic devices.\n\nAdvocates have long argued that this policy disproportionately affects Muslim travelers. In 2017, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Electronic Frontier Foundation sued the government over the practice, noting that there had been a sharp uptick of warrantless searches on electronic devices in recent years. The lawsuit, which argues that such searches should be considered unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment, is still pending.\n\nKhairullah said Friday that he believes he was detained for no reason and that the agents violated his privacy when they searched his phone. He hasn\u2019t ruled out the possibility of taking legal action, he said, adding that his wife, who has a green card, is now scared to leave the country to visit her family in Canada and Turkey. He and his children are all American citizens, he said, but that didn\u2019t seem to matter when he was stopped. Neither did being an elected official with decades of public service on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\n\u201cEven with U.S. citizenship, even with the 13-plus years as mayor, being a volunteer firefighter three years after I came to the U.S. ... all these hours of community service obviously doesn\u2019t matter when my name is Mohamed Khairullah,\u201d he said.", "description": "Mohamed Khairullah, the mayor of Prospect Park, N.J., said authorities held onto his phone for nearly two weeks after he was stopped at JFK International Airport.", "authors": ["Antonia Noori Farzan", "Reporter For The Morning Mix", "September At Am", "Antonia Noori Farzan Is A Reporter On The Washington Post'S Morning Mix Team.
