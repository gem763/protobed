Unfortunately for the 31-year-old quarterback, the NFL doesn\u2019t seem to be interested in him.\n\n\u201cHe is actively, actively interested in trying to play in the NFL,\u201d Mark Geragos, Kaepernick\u2019s attorney, told USA TODAY Sports on Tuesday.\n\nKap is so interested in getting back on the field that members of his team reportedly reached out to the Steelers, Jets and Saints, all of whom now have holes at quarterback thanks to injuries and illness. But according to Stephen A. Smith of ESPN, none of those teams have expressed interest in Kaepernick\u2019s services.\n\n\u201cI am being told that he has contacted \u2014 Colin Kaepernick\u2019s agent and others \u2014 have contacted the Pittsburgh Steelers. Essentially they\u2019re not interested,\u201d Smith said on First Take. \u201cThey\u2019ve contacted the Jets, no word on them yet. They\u2019ve contacted the Saints. They didn\u2019t get their phone calls returned.\u201d\n\nNext up on the list could be the Jacksonville Jaguars, who will be without starter Nick Foles for two months, and the Carolina Panthers, as it seems Cam Newton could miss this Sunday.\n\n\u201cColin is literally in the best shape of his life,\u201d Chris Williamson of SNY reported, according to ProFootballTalk. \u201cHe\u2019s been working out five days a week at 5 a.m. for three years. He wants to play and his agent has been contacting teams in need of a quarterback.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s high time for one of those teams to call Kaepernick back.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: RealClearLife, a news and lifestyle publisher, is now a part of InsideHook.
