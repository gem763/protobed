But while Ms. Warren came first, Mr. Sanders is going bigger. His wealth tax would apply to a larger number of households, impose a higher top rate and raise more money.\n\nMr. Sanders\u2019s plan to tax accumulated wealth, not just income, is particularly aggressive in how it would erode the fortunes of billionaires. His tax would cut in half the wealth of the typical billionaire after 15 years, according to two economists who worked with the Sanders campaign on the plan. Mr. Sanders would use the money generated by his wealth tax to fund the housing plan he released last week and a forthcoming plan for universal child care, as well as to help pay for \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me be very clear: As president of the United States, I will reduce the outrageous and grotesque and immoral level of income and wealth inequality,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in an interview. \u201cWhat we are trying to do is demand and implement a policy which significantly reduces income and wealth inequality in America by telling the wealthiest families in this country they cannot have so much wealth.\u201d", "description": "Mr. Sanders is embracing an idea at the center of Elizabeth Warren\u2019s presidential campaign.
