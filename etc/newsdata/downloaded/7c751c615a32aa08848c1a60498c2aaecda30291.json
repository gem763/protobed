Saudi oil ministry sources said the production had been disrupted by about 5m barrels a day \u2013 nearly half the kingdom\u2019s estimated output of 9.7m barrels and 5% of global production.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A pre-strike satellite image of the Abqaiq oil processing facility, released by the US government and DigitalGlobe, and annotated by the source. Photograph: maldonci/AP\n\nWho was responsible?\n\nThe Houthis, the Iran-aligned rebel army that has been fighting a Saudi-led military coalition in neighbouring Yemen for the past four years, claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nA spokesman said the assault was carried out by 10 drones. The Houthis recently acquired much more powerful drone technology that has given them the power to strike targets up to 1,500km away, according to the UN. In the past months, there have been unconfirmed reports of attacks by Houthi drones on civilian airports in Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi and Dubai. Western and Saudi governments believe Iran has been assisting the Houthis to acquire and use the advanced drones \u2013 a charge both Tehran and the Yemeni rebels deny.\n\nHowever, the US says there is no evidence the attack originated in Yemen and has squarely blamed it on Iran, seeing it as part of a pattern of threats to oil tankers and infrastructure in past months that it says Iran has carried out in response to sanctions on Iranian oil that are crippling the Islamic Republic\u2019s economy.\n\nThe US government has produced satellite photos showing what officials said were at least 19 points of impact at the two Saudi energy facilities, including damage at the heart of the Abqaiq plant. Officials told US media the photos show impacts consistent with the attack coming from the direction of Iran or Iraq, rather than from Yemen to the south. Tehran says it had nothing to do with Saturday\u2019s attack.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A satellite image released by the US of the Abqaiq facility.

Photograph: maldonci/AP\n\nWhy is this attack such a big deal?\n\nAbqaiq is the world\u2019s largest oil processing facility, where about two-thirds of the total Saudi supply is refined and cleaned of impurities such as sulphur and sand. \u201cThis is the heart of Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil infrastructure,\u201d said Homayoun Falakshahi, an oil and gas equity analyst at Kpler, a Paris-based energy data firm.\n\nA facility of such importance was supposed to be insulated from the wider instability of the Middle East. \u201cBecause of its importance it is very well protected, under extremely high security measures,\u201d Falakshahi said.\n\nThe fact that it can be severely disrupted is a sign that the world\u2019s energy infrastructure is more vulnerable than previously believed, and considered a legitimate target.\n\nHow are the regional actors aligned?\n\nThe Houthis are regarded as part of a network of militias in the Middle East who are sponsored or assisted in some way by Tehran, part of a broader fight to dominate the Middle East between Iran and Saudi Arabia that dates back to the Iranian revolution of 1979. The pair do not directly clash; the battle is playing out through proxy actors in Syria, Lebanon and Yemen, among other countries.\n\nIran continues to deny that it materially assists the Houthis but has become more openly supportive this year, inviting a Houthi spokesman to Tehran where he was praised as a \u201choly warrior\u201d by the country\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nWhat has been the impact on oil prices?\n\nNews of the attacks jolted the financial markets, sending the oil price soaring. The price of a barrel of Brent crude surged by 20% early on Monday to nearly $72 (\u00a358, up from $60 per barrel). That\u2019s a huge jump \u2013 the biggest move since the contract was created in the 1980s.\n\nIt then dropped back to about $66 per barrel after Donald Trump pledged to release some of America\u2019s oil reserves, to make up the shortfall from Saudi Arabia. That\u2019s a two-month high, up 10% compared with Friday night.\n\nEconomists believe the oil price could rise higher if Aramco cannot bring supplies back online quickly, or if there is military action in the Gulf.\n\nHigher oil prices can drag on global growth. It pushes up transport costs and the prices of petroleum-based products. This fuels inflation, leaving consumers with less disposable income.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fluctuations in the Brent crude oil price.

Although with the mercurial US president in charge, that too could quickly change.", "description": "Saturday\u2019s drone attacks severely disrupted global energy infrastructure and sent oil price soaring", "authors": ["Michael Safi", "Graeme Wearden"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dd2520ece017072009718ff86955dbccd8143e1/125_0_3750_2251/master/3750.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=04e5a653725867f972aae7fa0fbb753f", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
