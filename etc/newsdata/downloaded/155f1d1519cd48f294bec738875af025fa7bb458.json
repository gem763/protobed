And those who kept up the healthy eating for three months continued to feel better than at the start, researchers report in the journal PLoS ONE.\n\n\u201cThis has 100% reach (since everybody needs to eat), is more cost effective than medications, and is an aspect of treatment that individuals can control themselves,\u201d said lead study author Heather Francis of Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia.\n\n\u201cThis raises the possibility that making changes to diet can act as a therapy to improve depression symptoms,\u201d she said.\n\nFrancis and colleagues studied 76 people who scored high on two depression and anxiety scales - indicating moderate or high depression symptoms - and who also scored high on a questionnaire about dietary fat and sugar consumption.\n\nParticipants were randomly assigned to a diet-change group or a habitual-diet group for three weeks. The diet-change group received instructions from a registered dietician through a 13-minute video, which they could re-watch as needed. The video provided dietary guidance based on the 2003 Australian Guide to Healthy Eating as well as the Mediterranean Diet eating pattern. This included instructions to increase intake of vegetables to five servings per day, fruits to two or three servings per day, whole grains to three servings per day, lean protein to three servings per day, unsweetened dairy to three servings per day and fish to three servings per week.\n\nThe program also recommended daily consumption of three tablespoons of nuts and seeds, two tablespoons of olive oil, and one teaspoon each of turmeric and cinnamon. Participants were also told to decrease refined carbohydrates, sugars, fatty or processed meats and soft drinks.\n\nThe diet-change group also received sample meal plans and recipes, as well as a box of food items, including olive oil, natural nut butter, walnuts, almonds, sunflower seeds, cinnamon and turmeric. They were told to keep their shopping receipts to be reimbursed with a $60 gift card.\n\nAfter three weeks, average depression scores had dropped into the normal range in the diet-change group, while remaining elevated or severe in the habitual-diet group - and the improvements were maintained three months later, the research team reports.\n\n\u201cDepression is a whole-body disorder, not just a disorder of the brain,\u201d Francis said. \u201cDepression is associated with a chronic inflammatory response, but what is the source of this inflammation? (Earlier research has shown) that poor diet both increases systemic inflammation and is also a risk factor for depression.\u201d\n\nStill, researchers should be careful about suggesting cause-and-effect relationships in studies like these, said Marc Molendijk of Leiden University in the Netherlands, who wasn\u2019t involved in the research.\n\nMolendijk, who studies dietary habits and mental health and also serves on the PLoS ONE editorial board, cautioned against giving the results too much weight.\n\n\u201cThere probably are expectancy effects at play, leading to a placebo effect,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s also a bad message to depressed people, as they may attribute the responsibility for their depression to themselves.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, noted Joseph Firth of the University of Manchester in the UK, \u201cthe age-old saying, \u2018Healthy body, healthy mind\u2019 really is true.\u201d\n\nFirth, who also wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said, \u201cNo secret formula or complicated diets are required. Even simple positive behaviors such as eating healthier and being more active have notable benefits.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2019.", "description": "Young adults who eat poorly and feel blue might be able to perk themselves up by switching to a healthier diet, a small study suggests.
