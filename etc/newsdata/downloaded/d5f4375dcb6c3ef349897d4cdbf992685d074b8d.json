Ten yards in front of him were two of his black teammates, Tyrone Mings and Marcus Rashford, and a group of Bulgarian children were shouting for their shirts.\n\nMings and Rashford had been targeted for abhorrent racial abuse from a section of the home support, with the former saying he first heard the monkey chants when he went out for the warm-up, and they kept on walking, eyes fixed on the exit door a little way away. That is when they heard the noises, yet another round of them, from the so-called grown-ups in the vicinity. It is inconceivable Sancho did not hear them.\n\nPaltry fines and spineless words helped create the scenes in Sofia | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nA couple of steps later, it was the turn of Sancho . \u201cJadon, Jadon,\u201d the local kids yelled. They wanted his shirt. Sancho, who had come on as a 73rd-minute substitute, sized up the situation, the most jarring juxtaposition of innocence and ignorance, and made the decision. He peeled off his shirt, strolled over and handed it to one of the youngsters.\n\nIt was a simple gesture, one that recognised the joy a footballer can bring to a child, but it also chimed with one of the themes of a bleak occasion from an England perspective: defiance in the face of disgusting provocation; collective strength in adversity.\n\nIt was a night of shame for Bulgaria, whose football union has now been charged over the racist behaviour of the country\u2019s fans \u2013 when the right-minded majority in the wonderful city of Sofia cringed at the dunderheads. They included the journalists who tutted and scoffed during Greg Clarke\u2019s post-match press conference, when the Football Association chairman outlined his outrage at what he had seen and heard. \u201cExaggeration,\u201d one of them shouted.\n\nThe counterpoint would come from Ivelin Popov, the Bulgaria captain, who had remonstrated with home fans at half-time, urging them to calm down. \u201cI don\u2019t want it to be like this, it\u2019s not good for us, the federation and our country,\u201d Popov said. \u201cWhat happened was terrible. It must stop. It doesn\u2019t matter your colour, we are all the same, we are one very big family in football. Only if we are together can we stop these bad things.\u201d\n\nBefore the game it had not been difficult to spot the group of about 50 trouble-makers. They were dressed almost entirely in black and grouped together in a well-stewarded section by one of the corner flags. They were ejected just before half-time. Why let them in at all? That said, there were pockets of the similarly unenlightened in other areas.\n\nEngland\u2019s black players had heard monkey taunts on their previous visit to this stadium \u2013 for a European Championship qualifier in 2011 \u2013 and the punishment from Uefa was a \u00a334,230 fine. Those sort of measures simply have not worked and nor, on Monday\u2019s evidence, have partial stadium closures. The stadium had 5,000 seats cordoned off for England\u2019s visit because of the actions of their supporters in the June qualifiers against the Czech Republic and Kosovo.\n\nGareth Southgate had noted in the aftermath of last Friday\u2019s shock defeat against the Czechs in Prague that his squad faced \u201can interesting few days because we have not had a result or a performance like that\u201d. Many of the younger players had not experienced the backlash which always accompanies an England misstep. It is ferocious and the first idea, according to Southgate, had been to \u201crepair the confidence of the whole group\u201d. That was hard enough.\n\nJordan Henderson says England wanted to make racist fans \u2018suffer\u2019 Read more\n\nIn addition, the manager and the squad had to prepare for the possibility of racial abuse because it had happened to them in Montenegro last March. Back then they had not been properly briefed; they were not abreast of Uefa\u2019s protocols. This time they were and it meant carrying further emotional baggage.\n\nThe weight on Southgate has been immense and the one-time rather reluctant accepter of the England manager\u2019s job has added a fresh layer to his responsibilities; he has become one of the country\u2019s most high-profile ambassadors. \u201cThe job is a remarkable one in terms of the breadth of what you have to deal with,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t think of too much that\u2019s like it. We\u2019ve had to go through an incredible amount in 72 hours \u2013 football, non-football, everything else.\u201d\n\nAs usual, his delivery has been note perfect. He did not want to get into what he thought Uefa ought to do in order to combat racism more effectively but he did accept it had to try something different. \u201cIt was as big an operation as there has been in Sofia and the sad reality is that we weren\u2019t able to stop incidents happening,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cSomething clearly within the investigation has got to take that next step.\u201d\n\nSouthgate admitted that with 10 minutes of the first half to play and the monkey chants continuing despite an appeal over the PA for them to stop, he was \u201cnot confident we would be finishing the game\u201d. There would be two stoppages in play, as England drew attention to the racism but no walk-off, no abandonment. Southgate and his players made their statements by staying on and through the quality of their football and their dignity.\n\n\u201cThe players\u2019 response, their focus, the way they played though the stoppages and back into it, were remarkable,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cBizarrely, I think they\u2019ve gained strength from the experience.\u201d", "description": "England\u2019s firm but dignified handling of the shameful scenes in Sofia was character-building in the extreme", "authors": ["David Hytner"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/977a0143586f65fae156eed1f1dee1b757b8f035/0_174_4407_2644/master/4407.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=beeece9de398f928302f59d4356312bb", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
