Record prices were achieved and farmers will be paid by Oct. 28, he said.\n\nThe sale eases a crisis that left most of an estimated 48,000 wool and mohair farmers without earnings for more than a year after Guohui Shi and his Lesotho Wool Centre were unable to pay for the product they bought. Wool and mohair are Lesotho\u2019s main exports. Shi didn\u2019t answer a call made to his mobile phone.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to get some money back into the system and get the wheels turning. The industry was on its knees,\u201d said Telford, whose company fired 300 workers after the monopoly was awarded to Guoshui Shi. \u201cWe have also suffered, but not as much as the farmers who could not put food on the table.\u201d\n\nWhile the government has ended the monopoly, it\u2019s still insisting that wool and mohair be auctioned locally rather than being sold in South Africa, which had been the practice for decades. Combining the output of South Africa and Lesotho arguably makes the auctions in Port Elizabeth more attractive to foreign buyers.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s BKB Ltd. controlled most of the market and is now advising Maluti. Auctioning the fibre in Lesotho increases costs and, while international mohair buyers may travel there, its wool industry is less likely to attract interest because it\u2019s smaller than many global competitors. Maluti is yet to start selling wool. South Africa produces half of the world\u2019s mohair and runs the biggest auction globally in the coastal town of Port Elizabeth.\n\n\u201cThe farmers will get their money and that\u2019s the main thing,\u201d said Isak Staats, general manager for wool and mohair at BKB. \u201cIts an expensive solution. You are doubling the infrastructure.\u201d", "description": "Mohair sales in Lesotho, which produces a fifth of the world\u2019s supply of the luxury fiber, have restarted after the government buckled to pressure from farmers and ended a controversial monopoly handed to a Chinese entrepreneur.", "authors": ["Antony Sguazzin", "Mathabiso Ralengau"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7927/532c9b1a95e74df2a327de4c3b5e2abe.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
