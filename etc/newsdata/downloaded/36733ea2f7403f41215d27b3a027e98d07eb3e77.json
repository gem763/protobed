After years of talking about Death Stranding, Hideo Kojima finally showed off a full mission\u2019s worth of gameplay during a live stage presentation at Tokyo Game Show this week. It\u2019s as offbeat, meticulously detailed, and intriguing as you\u2019d expect from Kojima, if not more so.\n\nTo be released November 8 for PlayStation 4, Death Stranding follows Sam Bridges (Norman Reedus) as he makes a coast-to-coast trek across the ruined United Cities of America, creating new \u201cstrands\u201d that link divided human beings back together. With him is BB, or \u201cBridge Baby,\u201d a little foetus in an artificial womb that, among other things, allows him to see BTs, or \u201cBeached Things,\u201d supernatural monsters from other dimensions that are rampaging in the UCA.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot more to it than that, much of it likely involving Geoff Keighley, but that\u2019s the backstory you need to know to get the most out of the presentation, which was over 45 minutes of live gameplay. Sam is given a simple mission: deliver four aid packages from Knot City to Port Knot City. The aid packages contain four supplies that are considered crucial in this world: food, medicine, anti-BT weapons, and \u201csperm and eggs.\u201d\n\nBefore heading out on any mission, you\u2019ll pick out your loadout. This will include all the required aid packages that you\u2019re delivering, plus anything else you want to bring with you on the journey: extra shoes, ropes, weapons, etc. The difference between Sam Bridges and most video game heroes is that while everybody else just disappears all of their possessions into a magical pocket, Sam is visibly loaded up with his burdens. Everything he carries is visibly attached to his character, affecting his weight and mobility.\n\nWhere\u2019s Lydia when you need her? (Screenshot: Kotaku, Sony)\n\nYou can actually choose where on Sam\u2019s body to put all this stuff. You can load it all up onto his back like a pack mule, but you can also put items in pouches hanging off the backpack, strap them to his arms and legs, or have him hand-carry certain pieces.\n\nThis will affect his speed, yes, but also his balance. Sam\u2019s centre of gravity will be shown in a yellow circle underneath him as you shift things around. As you run through the world, if you make hard left or right turns, he\u2019ll go off-kilter if he\u2019s overburdened, and you\u2019ll need to press the L2 and R2 buttons to shift his weight back so he stays upright.\n\nYou\u2019re not stuck awkwardly carrying all this stuff at every moment, though. If you\u2019re about to, say, head into a battle, you can put your belongings down temporarily. You might also be able to acquire a Floating Carrier, a cross between an airport luggage cart and a hoverboard that will follow behind you with your big ol\u2019 pile of crap. (If needs be, you can even hop on and ride it yourself.)\n\nAll this futuristic technology all around us but the only way that they can transport a small container of food two miles down the road is to have Norman Reedus hand-carry it there. Onward to Port Knot City! First, Sam charts his journey: The game will calculate the direct route to his destination and show him all the topography, and the player can then plot a custom route from waypoint to waypoint to try to avoid the major hazards.\n\nScreenshot: Kotaku, Sony\n\nThe first obstacle Sam reaches in the video presentation is a river. Again, the HUD is here to give important information, showing the strength of the current in different spots. Blue is easily crossable, yellow is walkable with effort, and red will sweep you off your feet and send you down the river. Kojima walks into it for demonstration purposes, and shows how Sam is blown off course but also loses a package or two, which he has to pick up again.\n\nLeaving the river, Sam pauses to catch his breath (with the Circle button), and also checks in on his Bridge Baby to make sure he\u2019s still doing ok (and soothing him if not). He then pounds a canteen of Monster\u2122 brand energy drink, and hits the old dusty trail again.\n\nIt\u2019s not long before Sam comes across another package to add to his burden, a lost piece of musical equipment belonging to a character called the Musician. Fortunately for us, the Musician\u2019s house is just down a cliff and across a small ravine. Sam sticks a climbing anchor into the ground, then rappels down the cliff. He crosses the ravine with his helpful extendable ladder.\n\nFor sale: Baby tank, never filled. (Screenshot: Kotaku, Sony)\n\nLater in the demo, Kojima points out that thanks to the game\u2019s asynchronous multiplayer aspects, you might not even have to use your own ladder for this, since other players can leave their equipment in the world for others to use. He shows how there\u2019s now a climbing rope and a ladder left by other players. You can \u201cLike\u201d these items. Social-media \u201cLikes\u201d seem to be the currency of this world, just as they are in ours.\n\nSometimes other players will also drop helpful items that you can find in the world and pick up. By pressing the \u201ccommunication button\u201d while in the game, Sam will shout out something like \u201cIs anybody there?\u201d If items dropped by other players are in the vicinity, they\u2019ll flash to alert you to them. But apparently you can\u2019t just go around picking up every single thing dropped by others. The containers will be damaged when you find them, and you have to use a consumable called \u201ccontainer repair spray\u201d to fix them before you can harvest their resources.\n\nThere will also be lots of lockers scattered about the world, some left by other players, some controlled by enemies. These might have extra goodies for you, and you can also use them to stash your own stuff privately if needs be.\n\nEarthBound (1995) (Screenshot: Kotaku, Sony)\n\nAs a reward for bringing back the Musician\u2019s hi-fi equipment, you\u2019ll add a new \u201cstrand\u201d to the network and further link the world together. More importantly, he gives you a harmonica, which you can play to soothe the BB whilst you sit in the grass on a break. Death Stranding definitely wants you to take that downtime. There are even natural hot springs in the world where you and the Bottled Babbo can recharge your batteries. (Literally \u2014 it\u2019s called a \u201cbattery hot springs.\u201d)\n\nIt\u2019s not all just about slowly walking while holding a bunch of FedEx boxes full of sperm and singing to a baby. When Sam encounters a group of enemies, things become very Metal Gear Solid all of a sudden. Briefly abandoning his precious cargo, Sam goes into stealth mode, sneaking around an enemy camp.\n\nHe can use an item, which is also called a Strand, to \u201cbind human enemies from behind and parry attacks at close quarters.\u201d This, the description says, is a \u201cnon-lethal anti-personnel weapon.\u201d In fact, all the weapons we see in the demo are specifically called out as being non-lethal.\n\nThe HUD even shows what items enemies are carrying. (Screenshot: Kotaku, Sony)\n\nSam sneaks up on and incapacitates one enemy before Kojima allows him to be caught, thus turning the enemy camp into a full-on battle scene. Now he switches to the Bola Gun, which shoots out a Strand tied to two balls to tie up enemies from a distance.\n\nThe sight shows you the horizontal line that the bola will follow, so you can aim with precision. Charging the gun up will extend the length of the strand and the range of the shot. You can also punch and kick enemies, or even throw your luggage at them.\n\nAfter hacking into an enemy locker and finding an exoskeleton suit that lets Sam move faster and jump higher, he ditches the battle, using the suit to jump over a ravine that he would ordinarily have had to cross using a ladder as before.\n\nAs Sam nears Port Knot City, the sky goes dark and it begins to rain. Yep, it\u2019s a BT, a big scary gross monster. Now we\u2019re in a boss battle. Sam can fire the Bola Gun at the BT, but Kojima quickly opts for the Hematic Grenade. If you know your Latin, you\u2019re probably imagining what\u2019s in this grenade, and you\u2019re right \u2014 it\u2019s blood. If you don\u2019t have a \u201cblood bag\u201d in your arsenal, it\u2019ll use Sam\u2019s blood.\n\nAnd yet when I make and throw a blood grenade it\u2019s \u201cillegal\u201d and I \u201cget kicked out of the Carl\u2019s Jr.\u201d (Screenshot: Kotaku, Sony)\n\nWhy does human blood kill the BTs? Who knows, although Death Stranding will surely explain all of this in a 23-minute cutscene two months from now. If you run out of equipment during the battle, you can call for help from other online players, who can respond by giving you more weaponry. Winning the battle causes Sam to receive 100 \u201cLikes\u201d from the BB. Of course.\n\nWell, we finally have an idea of how Death Stranding plays. It looks good! Almost like a Breath of the Wild style reworking of Kojima\u2019s signature concepts. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll make us all ashamed of our words and deeds this November.", "description": "He\u2019s finally done it.
