This sounds like something out of a horror film, but the mysterious creature is actually a living organism \u2014 and a zoo in Paris is putting it on display.\n\nThe Paris Zoological Park announced this week it is unveiling a first-of-its-kind exhibit Saturday featuring a slimy organism called \"The Blob.\" The exhibit will showcase its rarities for the public and allow visitors to learn about the odd creature.\n\nThe unicellular mold is known officially as physarum polycephalum, or the \"many-headed slime.\" It has no mouth, stomach, eyes, brain or nervous system, but it can detect and digest food. The zoo said the organism first appeared a billion years ago.\n\nResearchers said the creature is essentially immortal, fearing only light and drought.\n\n\u00ab Le #blob est difficile \u00e0 placer dans l\u2019arbre du vivant. (...) Il nous apprend bien des choses sur la richesse de la vie sur Terre \u00bb, explique @BrunoDavidMNHN.\n\nRendez-vous d\u00e8s samedi au @zoodeparis pour entrer dans la blob-zone ! \ud83c\udf89@CNRS #RDVSauvage #5AnsZoodeParis pic.twitter.com/B6lQ7gnjDQ \u2014 Zoo de Paris (@zoodeparis) October 16, 2019\n\n\"The blob is really one of the most extraordinary things on Earth today,\" said Bruno David, the director of the French National Museum of Natural History in Paris. \"It's been here for millions of years, and we still don't really know what it is.\"\n\nThe zoo said the blob has almost 720 sexes and has no problems reproducing. It's been studied since the 1970s, but the mold remains mostly a mystery to scientists.\n\n\"The blob is a living being which belongs to one of nature's mysteries,\" David told Reuters.\n\nThe organism moves without legs, wings or fins at a speed of up to 1.6 inches per hour. It is also self-healing \u2014 able to regenerate itself in just two minutes after being cut in half.\n\nThe Blob is not an animal, a plant or a mushroom, but scientists are still not sure exactly how to classify it. It can remember things, adapt its behaviors and find its way out of a maze, which are all animal-like behaviors.\n\n\"It surprises us because it has no brain, but is able to learn ... and if you merge two blobs, the one that has learned will transmit its knowledge to the other,\" David added.\n\nResearchers at the Zoological Park first grew the organism in petri dishes and fed it its favorite food, oatmeal. It has since been moved to tree bark, which it feeds on, and continues to grow in a terrarium or glass container.\n\nThe Blob got its name from the 1958 science-fiction horror movie starring Steve McQueen, in which a blob from space terrorizes a Pennsylvania town. Scientists are hoping this blob behaves a bit differently to its film counterpart.", "description": "It has no mouth, stomach, eyes, brain or nervous system \u2014 but it can learn, remember things and even find its way out of a maze", "authors": ["Sophie Lewis"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/17/a371175e-fa7b-47ed-a292-33256a039801/thumbnail/1200x630/49c5a8bf4134259455273d85c7c4006f/gettyimages-1176167717.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
