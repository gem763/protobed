Jamil said on Twitter that she \u201cwill not be commenting on any of this\u201d in response to a tweet about her pulling out. HuffPost reached out to Ahmed\u2019s representatives for comment but did not immediately receive a response.\n\nIn a statement to HuffPost India, the Gates Foundation said it would still be giving the award to Modi next week, saying it is for \u201cthe progress India is making in improving sanitation\u201d and credited the Indian government\u2019s Swachh Bharat initiative with expanding access to \u201csafe sanitation\u201d to millions.\n\nHuffPost reached out to the Gates Foundation for further comment but did not immediately receive a response.\n\nHistory won't look kindly @gatesfoundation.\n\n\n\nThey're honoring Modi at a time when millions of Kashmiris have been silenced, millions in Assam have been rendered stateless & Muslims & Dalits are openly lynched.\n\n\n\nIt's an attack on human rights everywhere.https://t.co/Mv3tbDn4IK \u2014 Arjun Sethi (@arjunsethi81) September 17, 2019\n\nIn an opinion article in The Washington Post earlier this month, human rights lawyer Arjun Sethi wrote that, although public health is \u201cundoubtedly a priority in India,\u201d the foundation should not honor Modi, whose \u201cHindu nationalist party has incited violence against minorities, silenced dissent and curtailed freedom of expression,\u201d noting the \u201crepressive policies\u201d in Kashmir.\n\nThe Gates Foundation annual event in New York City on Sept. 24-25 will include New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern among its speakers. In previous years, former President Barack Obama spoke, as well as human rights advocate Malala Yousafzai.\n\nAs part of Modi\u2019s visit to the U.S. next week, he will also participate in an event with President Donald Trump in Houston \u201cto emphasize the strong ties between the people of the United States and India,\u201d according to the White House.\n\nA request for comment from the White House did not receive a response by late Monday.", "description": "Actors Riz Ahmed and Jameela Jamil have also pulled out of the event in which an award is to be given to Narendra Modi despite India's crackdown in Kashmir.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8030382300001c05551a5d.jpeg?cache=fiylcqufqf&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
