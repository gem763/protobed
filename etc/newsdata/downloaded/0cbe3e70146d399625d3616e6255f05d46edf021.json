U.S. sanctions have sharply cut Iranian oil sales, with the Iranian economy shrinking by 3% to 6%. Inflation is at least 40%. President Trump tightened the screws further on Sept. 20, with new sanctions on Iran\u2019s national bank.\n\nBut Iran is still dangerous and capable of causing problems that reach far beyond its borders. It may even have plans to derail the 2020 reelection effort of its new arch-nemesis, President Donald Trump.\n\nThe recent attacks on Saudi oil facilities\u2014launched either by Iran or Iranian subordinates in the region\u2014reveal Iran\u2019s ability to wreck oil infrastructure and drive up oil prices. The effect, this time, was fleeting. Oil prices spiked by about 12% following the strike, then fell about halfway back to pre-strike levels in following days.\n\nBut many analysts doubt the attack was a one-off. \u201cWhile Tehran will likely not immediately repeat an attack on the scale of the Aramco strikes,\u201d the Eurasia Group predicts, \u201cit will likely continue low-level attacks on oil and gas infrastructure\u2014such as going after tankers and pipelines\u2014which will cause anxiety in an already tense environment.\u201d\n\nA security guarder stands alert in front of Aramco's oil processing facility after the recent Sept. 14 attack on Aramco's oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia.

Under that deal, Iran would suspend development of nuclear weapons while the United States and other western countries lifted sanctions. Trump pulled out of that deal last year and reimposed sanctions, despite protests from other nations that signed the deal.\n\nIran has been making trouble ever since, seizing oil tankers in the Persian Gulf and attempting to mine at least one. The Sept. 14 missile and drone attack on Saudi oil facilities was the boldest move yet, temporarily knocking out 5% of the world\u2019s oil supply. Saudi officials repaired some of the damage quickly, but the attack revealed gaping vulnerabilities in Saudi critical infrastructure.\n\nThe situation may quiet down for a while, now that Iran has gotten the world\u2019s attention and the United States has responded with new sanctions. But some Trump critics, who feel sanctions are too feeble, are calling for U.S. military action instead. That might be just what Iran wants, since it would embroil the United States in yet another unwinnable Middle East war and probably send oil prices soaring.\n\nForcing oil prices higher\n\nIran wins if it can force oil prices up, since that causes pain to the United States and boosts revenue from the reduced amount of oil Iran is still selling. If Iran pushed oil prices high enough, it would add to Trump\u2019s mounting woes and endanger his reelection, since it would push gas prices up and hurt U.S. businesses dependent on oil.\n\nThe United States produces much more oil than it used to, and is no longer dependent on imported energy. Since oil is a global commodity, however, a shortage anywhere affects prices everywhere. If Iran could crimp oil production in the weeks prior to the 2020 election, it would push gas prices up and cause Trump a problem with voters (in addition to all the other problems he has).\n\nA Los Angeles gas station on April 9, 2019.

Any price under three bucks is generally fine with American drivers. If prices rose to $3.50 and stayed there, it would get people\u2019s attention, denting wallets and confidence. The real panic zone is $4 and up, last seen in 2011. At that level, the high cost of gas drains family budgets and causes tradeoffs that hurt the broader economy.", "description": "If Iran could crimp oil production in the weeks prior to the 2020 election, it would push gas prices up and cause Trump a problem with voters.", "authors": ["Rick Newman", "Senior Columnist"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9sRhCtdGPakE9We94bygmg--~B/aD0zNzA5O3c9NTEzMjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/e7ff3fe0-dbd6-11e9-9449-281a26dc9094", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
