She ran back to the house and her kitchen was just up in flames.\n\n\"They opened the door and tried to hose it which probably wasn't the best thing to do but when your house is on fire how else do you act?\n\n(Image: Belfast live WS)\n\n\"Laura is only 39 and has battled breast cancer and lymphoma so this is the last thing she needs because she is still quite poorly.\n\n\"The house was completely wrecked and they are all sleeping between my house and my mummy's house at the minute. We have sofa beds and things like that so we have pulled together to help them.\n\n\"Because Laura has been so ill, Kieran left work to look after her, and now they have been left with nothing - it's heartbreaking to watch.\n\n\"Her youngest boy's school uniform was destroyed and her other son had just started a new job and now all of his clothes and gear are gone.\n\n\"They were offered to move yesterday but the closest they could be placed is over 20 miles away. Laura came into my house last night in floods of tears. We feel like she hasn't really been accommodated for that well considering her situation and medical state.\"\n\nMaoilisea praised the Limavady community for their rapid response to her appeal and extended the appeal further to help the family get a new home.\n\n(Image: Belfast live WS)\n\n\"They are very proud people and wouldn't be the sort to ask for help,\" she said.\n\n\"But seeing the state of my sister and her family, I just had to do this appeal and the community have been unbelievable.\n\n\"We are shocked by the support but not shocked at the same time. If there is ever a crisis in Limavady, everyone comes together but you don't expect to ever have to avail of that support.\n\n\"I set up the Go Fund Me page just to help them to get a deposit up for a new house.\n\n\"Already we have had so so many generous offers of money and furniture. People are fantastic and if we can get anything at all for them it would be just so appreciated.\"", "description": "Laura Ferris, 39, has been made homeless along with her husband and their three sons after a devastating kitchen fire", "authors": ["Orlaith Clinton", "Image", "Belfast Live Ws"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20462478.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Mum-who-has-just-battled-cancer-left-with-just-one-photo-as-fire-guts-her-home.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
