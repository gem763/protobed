REUTERS/Chris Helgren\n\nToronto-based Onex\u2019s planned C$3.5 billion ($2.6 billion) buyout of Calgary-based WestJet has received approval from the carrier\u2019s shareholders and some regulators, but the agency is still reviewing whether the deal meets Canada\u2019s protective ownership laws.\n\nUnder Canadian rules, foreigners cannot own more than 49% equity in a Canadian airline. The rules further restrict a foreign airline and any single foreign owner from controlling more than a quarter of voting interests in a Canadian carrier.\n\nThe likely presence of Onex co-investors such as foreign wealth funds and carriers, and the \u201copaque nature\u201d of the deal to buy WestJet through company subsidiary Kestrel Bidco, will make it harder to ensure compliance with ownership laws, Air Canada argued in the letter to the Canadian Transportation Agency, dated Aug. 15.\n\n\u201cThe uncertainty and flexibility of co-investor\n\nparticipation introduces significant risk that non-Canadian co-investors will have control-in-fact of WestJet following the transaction,\u201d Air Canada said.\n\nAir Canada declined to comment on the letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters.\n\nThe Canadian Transportation Agency said it is aware of the issues raised in Air Canada\u2019s letter.\n\n\u201cThe process underway will allow the CTA to determine whether the proposed transaction will result in an undertaking that is Canadian,\u201d the agency said by email.\n\nOnex said in a statement that it \u201cis engaged with the CTA on the regulatory approval process of our transaction.\u201d\n\nAir Canada also argued that Onex requires at least a quarter of its board to be Canadian, which is below the government\u2019s threshold for control.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal announced in May, Onex\u2019s acquisition of WestJet is set to close later in 2019 or early next year. WestJet shares were down 0.3% at C$30.77 on Tuesday afternoon.\n\n($1 = 1.3275 Canadian dollars)", "description": "Air Canada has challenged Onex Corp's proposed acquisition of WestJet Airlines , on grounds that the deal may not meet the country's ownership rules, according to a letter sent by the carrier to the Canadian Transportation Agency.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190903&t=2&i=1425853810&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF821KL"}
