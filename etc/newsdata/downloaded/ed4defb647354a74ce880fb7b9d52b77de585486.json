How it happened, I don\u2019t know. But I\u2019m sure everybody wishes it hadn\u2019t happened.\u201d\n\nIn a letter to Ms Haigh, Sir Mark admitted the \u201coverall setting was not considered\u201d after plans were changed.\n\nSir Mark wrote: \u201cThere should have been a clearer delineation between the government policy aspects (concerning police recruitment) and political content.\n\n\u201cIn addition, the media questions went beyond police recruitment to cover other topical issues of the day. Due to the last minute changes these aspects were not considered properly.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe Prime Minister\u2019s Office are reviewing their visit planning process to learn any lessons and to improve planning and communications.\u201d\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nHome Affairs Committee Chair Yvette Cooper also received a letter from Sir Mark addressing the speech, and has called on the Prime Minister to apologise.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe Cabinet Secretary has now accepted that there should have been a clearer delineation between police recruitment and political content, that the setting of the speech was not reconsidered and that the implications of making a political speech in front of police officers were not properly considered either.\n\n\"He also states that the Prime Minister\u2019s Office are reviewing their visit planning process to learn any lessons.\n\n\"The Prime Minister should therefore apologise to West Yorkshire Police for putting them in such an invidious position when the police rightly guard their independence from politics and need to always be able to demonstrate their impartiality.\"\n\nBut she said Sir Mark's letter failed to answer serious questions put to him by the committee about who made the last minute changes and why.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe also still do not know how many police work and training hours were lost at a time when our police are overstretched and crime is rising.\n\n\u201cUltimate responsibility for this event and for exploiting West Yorkshire Police rests with the Prime Minister. But the Cabinet Secretary also has a responsibility to safeguard the impartiality not just of the civil service but also other public institutions such as the police.\n\n\"Sir Mark Sedwill must ensure that his role is not used to excuse inappropriate ministerial decisions. I am very concerned that this letter took a month to produce and answers few of the questions raised.\n\n\"This is not the only area where questions have been raised about whether Ministers are using public resources for political purposes in the run up to an election. In these very unusual times, the Cabinet Secretary must be more vigilant than ever\u201d.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE The PM was slammed for delivering a political speech in front of dozens of Police cadets", "authors": ["Mikey Smith", "Image", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20554985.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Britains-PM-Boris-Johnson-visits-West-Yorkshire.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
