A co-founder of the Negro Ensemble Company, Ward conceived the play as a \u201creverse minstrel show\u201d in which African American actors in whiteface would portray the white townspeople, who are outraged and befuddled by the loss of the workers they had exploited.\n\nIn the Theater Alliance production, directors Raymond O. Caldwell and Angelisa Gillyard audaciously seize on Ward\u2019s concept to position \u201cDay of Absence\u201d within the traditional structure of a minstrel show. Starting in the early 19th century, minstrel shows \u2014 which trafficked in stereotypes that demeaned and lampooned African Americans \u2014 were an enormously popular form of American entertainment. Regularly performed by white artists in blackface (though black artists also engaged in the genre), minstrel shows typically featured an \u201colio,\u201d or variety-act section, and a playlet \u201cafterpiece,\u201d as well as much music.\n\nRecalling and subverting the painful tradition of minstrelsy, Caldwell (Theater Alliance\u2019s producing artistic director) and Gillyard have turned Ward\u2019s one-act into an afterpiece, preceding it with music and variety acts that not only ponder the legacy of racism but also force theatergoers to examine their own biases. A magic trick involves a repurposed hand-picked-cotton crate. A game show asks questions about African American history, promising 40 acres and a mule as the prize. Clowns in a tug of war find their rope morphing into a noose.\n\nOn a technical level, the magic tricks and music (including a rendition of \u201cLift Every Voice and Sing\u201d) are underwhelming, but the clowning is serviceable, and Jared Shamberger delivers a poignant if wispy monologue about dispossession. (The actors researched and wrote their olio scripts.) All in all, the adapted-minstrel-show format reinforces the themes of Ward\u2019s play, adding a sobering reminder about bigotry in America.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s in the delivery of Ward\u2019s play that the problem arises. The production\u2019s all-black cast performs this section in whiteface, employing ultrastylized buffoonish movement and diction that emphasize the characters\u2019 stupidity and cravenness, with a nod to the dehumanizing stereotypes of minstrelsy. The approach accords with Ward\u2019s intent, but the shtick never varies in degree or timbre, becoming extremely monotonous. Incorporating nuance would not have undermined the message.\n\nOn a positive note, Shamberger and Dylan Fleming are quite funny as a mayor and a dimwitted lazybones named Luke, respectively. The show\u2019s visuals \u2014 including a deliberately stagey-looking small-town set, the historic minstrel show posters decorating the theater, the arch retro costumes \u2014 contribute to the provocative voltage. (Jonathan Dahm Robertson is the scenic designer; Jeannette Christensen devised the costumes.)\n\nThe show is billed as the first professional production of Ward\u2019s play in Washington. It arrives at an opportune time: A new group of African American dramatists has been invigorating the theater scene with intrepid, innovative plays that explore race while deliberately vaporizing audience comfort zones. Ward\u2019s drama is a precursor to this bracing trend.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDay of Absence, by Douglas Turner Ward. Directed by Raymond O.
