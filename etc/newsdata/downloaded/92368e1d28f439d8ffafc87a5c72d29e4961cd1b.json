We have microRNA too, but our mechanism for cartilage repair is stronger in some parts of the body, the study found. For example, the microRNA molecules are more active in our ankles, and less active in our knees and hips.\n\n\"We were excited to learn that the regulators of regeneration in the salamander limb appear to also be the controllers of joint tissue repair in the human limb,\" said Duke professor and researcher Ming-Feng Hsueh in the press release. \"We call it our 'inner salamander' capacity.\"\n\nRead More", "description": "Humans may not be able to regrow amputated limbs like salamanders can -- but we do have a \"salamander-like\" ability to regrow damaged cartilage, a new study has found.", "authors": ["Jessie Yeung"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191010122644-spotted-salamander-super-tease.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
