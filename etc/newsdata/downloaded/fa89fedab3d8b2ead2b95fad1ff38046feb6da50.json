REUTERS/Simon Dawson\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Former British Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator Olly Robbins will join Goldman Sachs\u2019 investment banking division after a sabbatical, the Cabinet Office said on Tuesday.\n\nRobbins, a politically impartial government employee, spearheaded May\u2019s negotiations on a deal with the European Union that would manage the country\u2019s departure from the bloc.\n\nThough the sides succeeded in agreeing a Withdrawal Agreement last November, May repeatedly failed to garner enough domestic support for it to pass through Britain\u2019s parliament, and she resigned earlier this year.\n\nRobbins, 44, has attracted criticism from prominent Brexit supporters who accused him of being too pro-EU.\n\nBut new Prime Minister Boris Johnson - who has himself said the deal would turn Britain into a \u201cvassal state\u201d - paid tribute to Robbins on Monday.\n\nRobbins will first spend a sabbatical at the University of Oxford, becoming the first holder of a visiting fellowship set up in memory of former Cabinet Secretary Jeremy Heywood.\n\n\u201cI am delighted that Olly will be the first Permanent Secretary to take up this Fellowship in Jeremy Heywood\u2019s memory, which follows his many years of dedication to public service in a variety of different roles,\u201d Johnson said in a statement.\n\nRobbins will then leave the civil service at the end of the fellowship to become a managing director in Goldman Sachs\u2019 Investment Banking Division.\n\nHe will join former European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, who is the non-executive chairman of Goldman Sachs International.", "description": "Former British Prime Minister Theresa May's chief Brexit negotiator Olly Robbins will join Goldman Sachs' investment banking division after a sabbatical, the Cabinet Office said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1428083126&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF881SD", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
