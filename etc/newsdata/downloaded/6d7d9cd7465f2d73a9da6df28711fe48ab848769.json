He said when summer droughts extend into fall it can push chinook spawning season back into when coho are also starting to spawn.\n\nWill Duguid, left, and Andres Araujo say drought likely caused coho and chinook spawning seasons to overlap. (Adam van der Zwan/CBC)\n\nDuguid said there are some fish that routinely generate hybrids \u2014 such as rainbow trout and cutthroat trout \u2014 but not wild salmon.\n\n\"Apparently, it rarely occurred in the past and there has never been documentation of hybridization into the second generation,\" said Duguid.\n\nHe said a member of the Cowichan Tribes spotted the first hybrid in the river during an adult fish tagging study being done in partnership between the First Nation and the province.\n\nDuguid said the hybrid fish can sometimes be identified by their abnormal scale arrangement, which is not patterned evenly on either side of their lateral line.\n\n\"This is indicative of the fact there may be other abnormalities that we can't see,\" said Duguid.\n\nHe said the hybrids are also identifiable by the degree of spotting on their tails, the shape of their anal fins and the morphology and colouration of their mouths.\n\nA member of the Cowichan Tribes spotted the first adult hybrid, similar to the one shown here, while tagging fish for conservation purposes. (Adam van der Zwan/CBC News)\n\nThe duo said human activity, such as forestry practices and climate change, are also changing the landscape of the Cowichan River region and also likely played a role in causing the hybridization.\n\n\"You are seeing a biological response to potentially an anthropogenic, or human-caused, forcing,\" said Duguid.\n\nAraujo said it is too soon to know if the chinook-coho hybrids are part of an evolutionary process. The hybrid fish have not yet been named.", "description": "Researchers on Vancouver Island are studying fish they recently discovered that share genes of both coho and chinook salmon.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5318478.1570818257!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/hybrid-coho-chinook.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
