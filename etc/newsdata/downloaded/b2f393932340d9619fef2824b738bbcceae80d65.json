Uncertainty over how much Bayer will end up paying to resolve the lawsuits have axed roughly 30% off the company's market value.\n\nBayer, which has argued that Roundup and its active ingredient glyphosate are safe, said it was \"constructively engaging\" in the mediation process and intended to defend itself vigorously in the appeals proceedings.\n\nAmid the legal issues, the company said sales in its crop science division recovered from last quarter's weakness, when Bayer was grappling with the effects of a bad planting season.\n\nSales in its crop science business rose 5.8% to EUR3.95 billion ($4.4 billion) in the third quarter, driven by growth in Latin and North America.\n\nThis helped the company post an overall rise in sales to EUR9.83 billion, slightly beating analysts' expectations, according to estimates from FactSet.\n\nSales in the pharmaceuticals unit, which still counts for a little more than half of group sales, rose 8.2% to EUR4.5 billion, driven mostly by its two blockbuster drugs, blood thinner Xarelto and eye treatment Eylea.\n\nNet income dropped 65% in the quarter to EUR1.04 billion, due mostly to a large divestment gain recorded in the comparable period last year.\n\nBayer confirmed its full-year outlook of a 4% rise in sales. In July, the company had warned that the severe weather that affected its crop-science division could put its 2019 sales target out of reach.\n\nWrite to Ruth Bender at Ruth.Bender@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 30, 2019 04:11 ET (08:11 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
