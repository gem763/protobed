It\u2019s a niche, specialized tool that managed to cut my editing time in half. There\u2019s just one problem: it\u2019s pretty much only useful for photography.\n\nThe company\u2019s newest product, the Loupedeck Creative Tool \u2013 or Loupedeck CT for short \u2013 solves this problem. With a combination of dials, buttons, and LED touchscreens, the device is able to adapt to a wide variety of software, including Adobe Lightroom Classic, Photoshop, Premiere Pro, Illustrator, Final Cut Pro X, and Ableton Live. Autodesk Fusion 360 support arrives later this year, and further software compatibility will be announced in 2020.\n\nMore than just presets for specific software, it comes with preset workspaces for different parts of the editing process \u2013 you\u2019ll want different functions when curating your photos than when you\u2019re actually editing, for instance. You can also create custom shortcuts, including for controlling your Windows or Mac functions, not just apps.\n\nThe gizmo features an aluminum build and high quality bearings; the company has come a long way from the original plasticky Loupedeck. It also features a detachable cable and comes in an overall more compact design than prior models, making it easier to transport.\n\nAt $549, it\u2019s a pricey accessory, but if it\u2019s anything like prior Loupedecks, the time savings alone could easily be worth the investment. You can place a pre-order at Loupedeck.com or B&H Photo Video; shipping begins November 11.\n\nFor more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on Twitter and Flipboard.", "description": "", "authors": ["Napier Lopez", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/plugged?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FLoupedeck_CT_Productshots_V1_Extra_021.jpg&signature=096877f5c208fdafd4340c581118a9f3", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
