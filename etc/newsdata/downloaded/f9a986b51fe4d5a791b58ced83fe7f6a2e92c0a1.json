Not the first time a gift received at a Bitcoin conference has caused me grief at the airport!\u201d\n\nOther community members have responded with some concern about how best to avoid losing or scrambling the miniature engraved tiles when a user wishes to recover their data.\n\nThe crypto hardware space\n\nAs reported, the market for hardware wallets \u2014 still dominated by Trezor, Ledger and KeepKey \u2014 nonetheless continues to expand, most recently with BTCC founder Bobby Lee\u2019s launch of a credit card-sized device offering cold storage of Bitcoin (BTC) and fourteen altcoins.\n\nLast year, a new product from Bitfi fielded a PR disaster after testers debunked the company\u2019s claims its wallet was unhackable. The launch had the support of Bitcoin proponent John McAfee, who vigorously defended the wallet until Bitfi admitted it was vulnerable.\n\nCoinbase has meanwhile tackled the question of backup differently to Cryptosteel\u2019s physical offering by launching encrypted cloud storage services for users\u2019 private keys \u2014 a solution that has been met with scepticism due to its reliance on online centralized servers.", "description": "Cryptosteel has launched its Cryptosteel Capsule, a physical backup device for the offline storage of Bitcoin private keys, passwords and wallet recovery seeds", "authors": ["Marie Huillet"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvNmQ1MWM4YzhkYjgzZmFiN2RiMmQzNzMyOWM4ODZmNzkuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
