No Americans were hurt.\n\nEsper said it was unclear whether that was an accident.\n\nSyrian Kurds say they have reached an agreement with the government in Damascus headed by President Bashar Assad (above) whereby his forces will protect them against Turkey\n\nTrump, in a tweet, said: 'Very smart not to be involved in the intense fighting along the Turkish Border, for a change. Those that mistakenly got us into the Middle East Wars are still pushing to fight. They have no idea what a bad decision they have made.'\n\nLater in the day Sunday, Kurdish officials announced they will work with the Syrian government to fend off the Turkish invasion, deploying side by side along the border. Syrian TV said government troops were moving to the north to confront the Turkish invasion but gave no details.\n\nThe Kurdish fighters had few options after the United States abandoned them, and it had been anticipated they would turn to Assad's government for support.\n\nA return by Assad's forces to the region where Syrian Kurds have built up autonomy in the north would be a major shift in Syria's long-running civil war, further cementing Assad's hold over the ravaged country.\n\nLate Sunday, Syrian TV broadcast from the northern town of Hassakeh where residents took to the streets to celebrate the announcement of cooperation between the Syrian government and the Kurds, and many vowed to defeat the Turkish invasion.\n\nIt would also mean that U.S. troops no longer have a presence in an area where Russia and Iranian-backed militias now have a role.\n\nIt was not clear what Russia's role was in cementing the agreement. But Russian officials have been mediating low-level talks between the Kurds and Damascus. Syria is allied with Russia, and Turkey, though it is a NATO member, has drawn close to Moscow in recent years under Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nThe U.S. withdrawal leaves open the question of what happens to the Kurdish-run prisons and detention centers that hold thousands of Islamic State prisoners, including more than 2,000 foreign militants.\n\nOn Sunday, heavy fighting reached a Kurdish-run displaced-persons camp in Ein Eissa, some 20 miles south of the border, that is home to some 12,000 people, including around 1,000 wives and widows of Islamic State fighters and their children.\n\nA Turkish army armored vehicle advances in Syrian city of Tel Abyad as seen from the Turkish border town of Akcakale on Sunday\n\nThe Kurdish-led administration in northern Syria said in a statement that 785 Islamic State supporters escaped after attacking guards and storming the gates.\n\nIt was not immediately possible to confirm that figure.\n\n'It gets worse by the hour,' Esper said of the fighting.\n\n'These are all the exact things' that U.S. officials warned Erdogan would probably happen in urging him not to invade.\n\nErdogan on Sunday ruled out any mediation in the dispute with the Kurds, saying Turkey won't negotiate with \"terrorists.\"\n\nTurkey's official Anadolu news agency said Turkey-backed Syrian forces had advanced into the center of a Syrian border town, Tal Abyad, on the fifth day of Turkey's offensive.\n\nTurkey's Defense Ministry tweeted that its forces had taken control of the main highway running between Hassakeh, a major town and logistics hub, and Ein Eissa, the administrative center of the Kurdish-held areas.\n\nCasualties mounted. On Sunday, at least nine people, including five civilians, were killed in Turkish airstrikes on a convoy in the Syrian border town of Ras al-Ayn, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and Syrian Kurdish officials.\n\nImages of the attack showed bodies and severed limbs strewn in the street. Some of those killed appeared to be carrying guns.\n\nActivists said the gunmen were guarding the convoy.\n\nTurkey said 440 Kurdish fighters have been killed since the operation began Wednesday.\n\nThe SDF said 56 of its fighters have died. Turkey also said four of its soldiers were killed, along with 16 allied Syrian fighters.", "description": "The shift could lead to clashes between Turkey and Syria and raises the specter of a resurgent ISIS as the U.S. relinquishes any remaining influence in northern Syria to President Bashar Assad (left).", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Ariel Zilber For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/06/19678382-0-image-a-15_1571032307595.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
