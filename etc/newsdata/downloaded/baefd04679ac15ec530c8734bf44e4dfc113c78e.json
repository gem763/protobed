She also said she never met Hunter Biden, or had anything to do with the Burisma controversy.\n\n\u201cAlthough I have met Vice President Biden several times over the course of our many years in government, neither he nor the previous administration ever, directly or indirectly, raised the issue of either Burisma or Hunter Biden with me.\u201d\n\nThe former ambassador was described as \u201cbad news\u201d by President Trump in his phone call with Ukrainian President Zelensky, disparaged by the president\u2019s personal lawyer Rudolph Giuliani, and reportedly targeted by a number of conspiracy theories sent to the State Department.\n\nMs. Yovanovitch said she only met Mr. Giuliani on a handful of occasions, none of which involved the Ukrainian allegations, but said some of his associates\u2019 \u201cfinancial ambitions\u201d were foiled by anti-corruption policies in Ukraine.\n\nThe former ambassador\u2019s ouster was one of the key red flags for the whistleblower, whose complaint detailing concerns about Mr. Trump using his position and military aid to pressure Ukraine into investigating a political rival sparked the latest investigation.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
