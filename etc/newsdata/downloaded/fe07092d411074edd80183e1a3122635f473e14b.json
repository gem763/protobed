Yes, the model and the pop star have been legally married since September 13, 2018, but that didn't stop the absolute media madness surrounding the official ceremony. Just one week post-nuptials, on October 7, Hailey shared a plethora of stunningly photographed wedding shots, complete with massive rings, wistful almost-kissing poses, and probably the most extra veil a bride has ever worn.\n\nAbout that veil: Let me draw your attention to Bieber Wedding Exhibit One, the first of several wedding posts from Hailey. In it, the newlyweds are sharing a kiss, but they're not the focal point at all. Ahem \u2014 the train. In the other shots, this veil appears to be your standard mile-long lace get-up, however, Hailey upped the ante by having \"'Till death do us part\" stitched into the very bottom, accompanied by a big 'ol exclamation point. She enlisted Virgil Abloh, the creative director of Louis Vuitton menswear, and his fashion house Off White to design the veil, and clearly it paid off because this is a fucking photo op if I've ever seen one. \"Last Monday was the most special day of my life:),\" Hailey captioned the post.\n\nNow, listen. I'm not saying this is a weird flex but... it's kind of a weird flex, no? Just think back to the Biebers right after they were legally married. In February, they held a joint interview with Vogue in which they said some unexpectedly dark stuff for a pair of kids in love. Justin, for example, said, \"We don't want to say the wrong thing, and so we've been struggling with not expressing our emotions, which has been driving me absolutely crazy because I just need to express myself, and it's been really difficult to get her to say what she feels.\" Hailey, on the other hand, said, \"The thing is, marriage is very hard. That is the sentence you should lead with. It's really effing hard.\"\n\nAnyway, my strangely intense feelings about this couple's future aside, this veil is extremely metal. Hailey and Justin Bieber are here to let you know that nothing is going to tear them apart until they're in the grave, OK? It's also just really dang pretty, and that I can get behind.\n\nMore on the Biebers:\n\nNow, watch Hailey's makeup artist break down her best looks:\n\nDon't forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.\n\nOriginally Appeared on Allure\n\n", "description": "Hailey and Justin Bieber are here to let you know that nothing is going to tear them apart until they're in the grave, OK?", "authors": ["Nicola Dall'Asen"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/BeHcoFamOFqFl25U415ucA--~B/aD0yMTMwO3c9MzIwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/allure_895/87bcb02bd9b69f7e62ce03d6ed602947", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
