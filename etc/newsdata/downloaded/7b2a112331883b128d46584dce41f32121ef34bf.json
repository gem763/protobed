Elizabeth Warren, his ascendant challenger, is not forcefully confronting him. Warren and Bernie Sanders, the progressive behemoths in the race, are not separating from each other.\n\nDeep into the 2020 primary campaign \u2014 post-Labor Day and with three rounds of debates and fundraising quarters past \u2014 caution, patience and stasis have emerged as the defining traits of the Democratic contest.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nEven as three candidates have pulled away from the rest of the field, early-state Democrats say it\u2019s remarkable how none of them have truly taken command of the primary. They\u2019re not seeing bold strategic strokes designed to distinguish their campaigns or sustained attempts to strike a decisive blow against rivals. And they don\u2019t see an obvious front-runner with just 140 days until the Iowa caucuses.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really strange,\u201d said Sean Bagniewski, the chairman of Iowa\u2019s Polk County Democrats. \u201cIt\u2019s strange that we\u2019re this far along, we\u2019ve been slugging it out, it feels like, for two years, we have this much interest, and there\u2019s not really a clear favorite yet.\u201d\n\nSome have been counting on Sanders and Warren to better highlight their differences by now. Other Democrats were expecting a collision between Biden and Warren at last week\u2019s debate \u2014 a confrontation that never materialized. Instead, a lower-polling candidate, former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, appeared to re-awaken. By the end of the week, Biden\u2019s campaign was tangling with Juli\u00e1n Castro, who is polling at around 1 percent, over the appropriateness of Castro questioning Biden\u2019s memory.\n\nAs one Democratic official in Iowa said of the field, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a bunch of exceptionally talented people, a bunch of exceptionally talented vice presidents, cabinet members, DNC chairs. But there\u2019s no president yet.\u201d\n\nOne reason for the lack of clarity: for the most part, the top-tier candidates have adhered closely to their original battle plans, feeling little pressure to improvise or change direction. Warren\u2019s approach has been slow and steady, ever-confident in the eventual payoff from her expansive field organization and detailed policy agenda. Biden\u2019s campaign has shown few signs of panic in the face of gaffes and other candidate missteps.\n\nBut the lack of volatility in the campaign also reflects a caution informed by experience: Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign surged in June following her criticism of Biden for his past opposition to busing and former associations with segregationist senators. But she quickly fell back. Castro, the ex-HUD secretary, has not benefited in public opinion polls from his rebukes of O\u2019Rourke or, more recently, Biden. None of the candidates, in fact, who have singled out rivals for sharp criticisms \u2014 New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, among them \u2014 have seen big returns on their attacks.\n\nA still-evolving primary issue set is also driving the measured approaches of the individual campaigns. Last week, O\u2019Rourke \u2014 who had failed to gain traction in the campaign for months \u2014 drew newfound attention for his call for a mandatory buyback program for assault weapons. The candidates\u2019 competing views on health care, a defining issue of the campaign, are only now becoming more clearly defined.\n\nSanders and Warren, flanking Biden on stage in Texas, battled over the differences in their plans. Biden noted that Warren has in the past asserted \u201cI\u2019m with Bernie,\u201d on Medicare for All, then stressed that he supports keeping the Affordable Care Act but adding a public option. \u201cI\u2019m for Barack,\u201d he said, before pressing Warren on whether she would raise taxes on the middle class to pay for the plan.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/25/a1/ce1dee70451ab229deac77900923/compilation.png\" true\n\n\u201cI think clearly for the first time you had Bernie and Warren having to defend Medicare for All in a way they haven\u2019t had to. Biden had help making that case from [Sen. Amy] Klobuchar and Mayor Pete [Buttigieg],\u201d said Joe Trippi, a Democratic campaign veteran. \u201cThat\u2019s the big defining issue. They\u2019re going to have it out and that\u2019s not going to happen in one night. That was the beginning of it. That was the first shots fired, the first volley \u2014 real volleys \u2014 I think you\u2019re starting to get to the crux of the matter.\u201d\n\nTrippi said the vast majority of Democratic voters are still not tuned into the primary or even watching the debates. Those who are tuned in tend to have more hardened views behind a certain candidate.\n\n\u201cAnybody who thinks this thing is set is just not understanding a multi-candidate field like this,\u201d Trippi said. \u201cThe only people paying attention are really interested people, who already love Joe Biden and think he\u2019s the greatest, or already love Elizabeth Warren. They\u2019re all watching to cheer their candidates. So when you attack someone else, you\u2019re not going to score anything against them. That\u2019s why when Castro attacks Joe, everybody pukes. It was the same mistake Harris made in the first debate.\u201d\n\nComparing the primary to a marathon, Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said, \u201cWe\u2019re at mile eight.\u201d\n\nWith many top Democrats \u2014 like Perez \u2014 convinced that it\u2019s still early in the campaign rather than late, one view holds that there is still a great deal of fluidity in the field.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, it\u2019s clear that 60 percent of the voters are with the top three candidates, and that has been very stable,\u201d said Rose Kapolczynski, a Democratic strategist who is unaffiliated in the race. \u201cOn the other hand, Biden and Sanders are not knocking it out of the park every day, and they aren\u2019t growing.\u201d\n\nShe said, \u201cI still think there is a good chance that someone else emerges.\u201d\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/3c/04/c54344d143aca2f92f3db8181af0/kamala-wizardoz.png\"\n\nThough six Democrats have already dropped out of contention and many others are on the brink, Bakari Sellers, Harris\u2019 campaign co-chair in South Carolina, said it\u2019s too soon to count out candidates who have time to catch on with voters.\n\n\u201cThe reason that the top three are the top three is simple: there was a draft Warren movement since 2014, Bernie Sanders has been running for president since 2015 and Joe Biden\u2019s been running for president since before I was born,\u201d Sellers said. \u201cA lot of these candidates are still learning who they are and defining themselves and now voters are finally paying attention.\u201d\n\nThe primary campaign appears likely to become even more muddled over the next month. Biden appears no stronger \u2014 or weaker \u2014 than he did entering the last debate. Warren and Sanders have not appeared anxious to confront each other. Major donors in Texas were jockeying for photographs with Andrew Yang after the debate, while Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker were both widely viewed as significantly more effective than in previous debates.\n\nJen O'Malley Dillon, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign manager, said people only now \u201care starting to tune in,\u201d predicting, as other candidates\u2019 advisers have, that the race will remain fluid \u201cthrough the winter.\u201d\n\nIn remarks at a Houston fundraiser on Friday, Biden noted as much.\n\n\u201cThe fact of the matter is for the first time we had something approaching a debate,\u201d Biden told the crowd.\n\n", "description": "For the most part, the top-tier candidates have adhered closely to their original battle plans, feeling little pressure to improvise or change direction.", "authors": ["David Siders", "Natasha Korecki"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/46/ce/808e3b3f44fb9b5621723e3644aa/190915-dem-debates-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
