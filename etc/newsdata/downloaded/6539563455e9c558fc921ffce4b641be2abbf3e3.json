It was May 2006, and the former IBF and WBO world champion boxer was just settling into a job that was helping him get back on his feet after retirement. And then his world collapsed beneath him.\n\n15-year-old Kiyan had attempted to break up a fight between classmates outside his school, when a large pocket knife was plunged into his heart. As a doctor proceeded into the waiting room to confirm the worst, Mark began swinging fists at the hospital walls in a blind fury, tears streaming. \u201cI made sounds that I\u2019ve never heard before,\u201d he tells The Independent, his voice breaking, \u201cMy feelings were gone\u2026 and then rage. Rage comes in. Someone needs to pay for this. Who\u2019s killed my son? Who\u2019s taken my son?\u201d\n\nMark is close to tears once more as he dredges up his emotions, splaying them out across the royal blue seats of Loftus Road. At the time of his death, Kiyan was playing for Queens Park Rangers\u2019 youth team. His first professional contract was just a few months away. He was tipped to play for England, and clubs across London, including Arsenal, had declared their interest. Premier League football wasn\u2019t just a dream, it was slowly turning into an expectation.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nMark\u2019s dream, long before that fatal incident took place, was to eradicate knives from London streets. He had worked with Islington Council, talking to local teenagers about violence. And yet his own son, who accompanied him to those workshops, would be the one to get stabbed.\n\nYears of court cases, resentment, and indescribable pain followed. Mark wanted, and almost acted on, thoughts of revenge. But something inside him brought about an emphatic change, and the Kiyan Prince Foundation was eventually born. As a qualified life coach, and with an OBE for his work, Mark has now returned to guiding susceptible youths away from crime under an organisation in his son\u2019s name.\n\n\u201cWhen I meet young people and they\u2019re from the roads, and they\u2019re doing dirt, they\u2019re hurt when they see the hurt that I\u2019m going through. And many of them want to change because they understand and see the pain and damage that it\u2019s caused. I think it\u2019s really important that people really see, that young people see, the real damage that they\u2019re doing,\" Prince explained.\n\nQPR did what they could to support the Prince family, and they\u2019ve partnered together with the foundation on various community projects since its inception. But the next gesture will really mean the world. After running a competition this summer to nominate a local charity to hold the stadium\u2019s naming rights for at least one season, fans picked the Kiyan Prince Foundation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in shock, but there\u2019s excitement added to our shock. Like, wow, Kiyan\u2019s name\u2019s going to be outside the stadium of the club he played for,\u201d Mark says with a glistening smile, \u201cThis is my team. These guys love my son. There\u2019s always been a relationship with us, but this is different. This is a whole new level. The fans demonstrated that they care about Kiyan Prince. They care about the work that I\u2019ve done. And that means a lot to me. I love this club.\u201d\n\nIn the midst of an era where every ounce of the footballing universe is stripped and monetised, this is a pioneering step where, finally, people are the focus. An organisation that deals with the future of the capital\u2019s knife infestation is getting the platform it deserves. Instead of half-hearted, plastic PR content, this is what football needs more of.\n\nOn 10 August QPR will walk out for their first home fixture of the season against Huddersfield, and officially unveil and celebrate the new name of their stadium. As fans clad in blue and white gather on South Africa Road, in their eyes, the name Prince will be King.\n\n\u201cI think when we see what\u2019s going on in London at the moment, there\u2019s not a day that goes by where we don\u2019t pick up the paper and someone else has been stabbed,\u201d says Les Ferdinand, QPR\u2019s director of football, \u201cthis affects families. The more awareness we can bring to it, the more we can do about it \u2013 Mark is doing a tremendous amount of work \u2013 the more people we can get on board with that, hopefully the better the future will be.\u201d\n\nIn the last five years knife crime has risen 70 per cent in the UK, and in April it reached the highest level since records began. With his head in his hands in disbelief, Mark claims the system is utterly broken. Alongside the endless promise of more police officers, he questions the root causes such as cuts to youth services and the lack of funding for local charities.\n\nIn 2017 Mark sat down with London mayor Sadiq Khan, offering a meticulously planned strategy that he claims would \u201csave them millions\u201d in helping with the city\u2019s knife epidemic, but he walked away feeling ignored, and further disenchanted by politicians.\n\n\u201cI just think we live in a society that continually shows us that we don\u2019t actually want to deal with this \u2013 we only say we want to deal with it,\u201d Mark stresses with a sigh, \u201cIt goes much deeper than knives. People need support and help in a world that doesn\u2019t care about the welfare of individuals.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s deal with truth, and let\u2019s deal with reality,\u201d he adds, \u201cIt\u2019s not like we don\u2019t know the solution. It\u2019s already being done in Scotland. We don\u2019t need any more debates, even if they\u2019re real debates. Let\u2019s just save the children. They are dying. They have a twisted mindset, and we have to blame everyone in society for our children being like this\u2026. You\u2019ve got to take a knife out of the mind, not out of the hand.\u201d\n\nYou can donate to the Kiyan Prince Foundation here to assist with funding their various programmes that can help young people and change the narrative on carrying knives.", "description": "Mark Prince was at work when he got a call to say his son had been stabbed.
