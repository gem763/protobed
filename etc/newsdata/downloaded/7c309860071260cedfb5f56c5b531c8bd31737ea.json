Under county rules, elementary students who rack up debt for unpaid meals have their entree replaced with a turkey and cheese sandwich. High school students get a cheese sandwich.\n\nLevy said he was startled to learn about the situation.\n\n\u201cFood is something that you shouldn\u2019t have to think about,\u201d Levy told CBS-4 TV. \u201cChildren shouldn\u2019t have to learn hungry. These children that were in debt were going to either not eat or they would get just cheese sandwiches, and I thought that\u2019s crazy.\u201d\n\n(Watch his interview in the video above.)\n\nLevy wrote about his decision on Facebook, and other people responded when he asked how donations could help elsewhere in Palm Beach County, where Jupiter is located, and beyond.\n\nThe county has a page on its website explaining how people can help students, who owe a total of $51,000 in school lunch debt. So far this year, people have contributed $8,600. Levy said he\u2019s now considering holding annual fundraisers to erase the debt.", "description": "Andrew Levy's donation means hundreds of kids in Jupiter schools can get full meals again.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da559ee200000cb0c500c96.png?cache=v9gigt4cl5&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
