But, no, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ready for that. I think we have a ways to go yet,\u201d Trump said.\n\nKim, in the letter sent in the third week of August, spoke of his \u201cwillingness\u201d for a third summit and extended an invitation for Trump to visit the North Korean capital of Pyongyang, the JoongAng Ilbo newspaper reported, citing an unidentified source.\n\nTrump on Aug. 9 said he had received a \u201cvery beautiful letter\u201d from Kim.\n\nBut U.S. officials have not said anything about a second letter in August.\n\nTrump and Kim have met three times since June last year to discuss ways to resolve a crisis over North Korea\u2019s missile and nuclear programmes, but substantive progress has been scant.\n\nTheir first two meetings were formal summits, the second of which, in Vietnam in February, broke down after they failed to narrow a gap between U.S. demands for North Korean denuclearization and a North Korean demand for relief from sanctions.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump meets with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas, in Panmunjom, South Korea, June 30, 2019.
