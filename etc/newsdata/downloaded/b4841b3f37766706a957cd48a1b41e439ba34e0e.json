Reyes (12-0 MMA, 6-0 UFC) needed just 1:43 to finish Weidman (14-5 MMA, 10-5 UFC) via TKO in the main event at TD Garden in Boston.\n\nWeidman used his wrestling base to score a takedown in the fight\u2019s early moments, but Reyes patiently worked back to his feet. And when they broke, it didn\u2019t take long.\n\nWeidman lunged forward and walked straight into a ridiculous Reyes left hand, which dropped his foe. He followed up with a series of hammerfists, starting with lefts and finishing with rights, before referee Herb Dean waved things off.\n\n\u201cI was out there having fun, feeling loose,\u201d Reyes said. \u201cIt was everything I imagined it to be. I was so honored to fight Chris. He\u2019s such a tremendous competitor.\u201d\n\nAll nine of Reyes\u2019 career stoppage wins have come in the first round. Weidman now has been finished in five of his past six fights.\n\nReyes left a strong hint that he thinks he\u2019s ready for a title shot at champion Jon Jones during his post-fight interview.\n\n\u201cHey, Jon, I don\u2019t want any party favors, man. I want that belt,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nGallery Dominick Reyes def.
