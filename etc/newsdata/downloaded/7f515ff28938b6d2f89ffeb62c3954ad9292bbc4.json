Oh for referendums with such decisive majorities.\n\nHalf a century on, there\u2019s a cloud on Gibraltar\u2019s horizon: Brexit.\n\nThe self-governing territory joined the EU on the UK\u2019s coat-tails in 1973 and now forms part of my constituency as an MEP. In 2016, Gibraltarians voted 96 per cent to remain in the EU; in the recent European elections, 77 per cent voted in support of the strongly anti-Brexit Liberal Democrats. It's not hard to see why.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

One in four jobs in the Spanish region is supported by Gibraltar, while more than 14,000 people cross the border every day to work in the British territory. Almost half of Gibraltar\u2019s jobs are taken by frontier workers and in some sectors, such as tourism, it\u2019s more than 70 per cent. The tourists themselves take advantage of an open land border: in 2017, 9.8 million people used it to visit Gibraltar. And Gibraltar airport is also governed by EU civil aviation measures under the Single European Sky agreement (despite Spain\u2019s objections).\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Northern Ireland\u2019s border issues are grabbing the headlines but Gibraltar is even more dependent on a fluid, open border. The close, mutually beneficial relationship between Gibraltar and its Spanish neighbours is at obvious risk from the uncertainty and expected border disruption of no-deal. The government\u2019s own assessment predicts hours of delays for border workers, and the disruption of food, medicines and other goods due to extra checks \u2013 all of which will harm Gibraltar\u2019s economy.\n\nEven Theresa May\u2019s managed Brexit deal conceded (despite many transitional arrangements being put in place) that \u201cafter the United Kingdom leaves the Union, no agreement between the EU and the UK may apply to the territory of Gibraltar without agreement between the Kingdom of Spain and the UK.\u201d Spain\u2019s modern politicians now regret the 1713 treaty that ceded Gibraltar to Britain in the first place. They could use the years of post-Brexit negotiations that lie ahead of us even in a soft Brexit to make life difficult for the Rock. The claim that Brexit uncertainty will all be over on 31 October even if Boris Johnson gets his way is, of course, a lie.\n\nAnd just think what price Spain might extract for the return of the UK to the EU as a member state, if Brexit happens but our children later conclude that it was a ghastly, historic mistake. Spain followed the UK into the EU so has never before had the prospect of holding such an extraordinary bargaining chip. We would all hope that a future UK government\u2019s commitment to self-determination would withstand any re-entry negotiations. But this wouldn\u2019t be guaranteed.\n\nBrexit doesn\u2019t just pose an immediate threat to Gibraltar\u2019s daily life and prosperity. If it happens, it will cast a very long shadow over the Rock and its future.\n\nMartin Horwood is Liberal Democrat MEP for South West England and Gibraltar", "description": "Today is Gibraltar\u2019s national day.\u00a0It marks the referendum date in 1967 when the Mediterranean territory voted by an overwhelming 12,138 to 44 to remain a British overseas territory.
