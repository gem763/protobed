Their support is always important to us but my auntie is trying to tell me how to play number eight and telling things to my brother (prop Mako) as well. Luckily he looks after all the admin.\u201d\n\nVunipola needs no reminders of what Vermeulen brings, having lost to the South African on all three occasions he has faced him for England.\n\n\u201cHe just played better,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve played against them a few times and he\u2019s got up so I\u2019m going to try my best to win that little battle.\n\n\u201cI played against him last summer and he was monumental in terms of getting them those two victories. Not just me, but we\u2019ve got to try and negate his influence.\u201d\n\nHaving seen how South Africa approached their game against Wales on Sunday England are not expecting a radical change of tack in the final.\n\nFaf de Klerk is likely to rain high balls down on England\u2019s defence and send his big men crashing in to them. It will not be a place for shrinking violets.\n\n\u201cWhat we are going to witness are the two most powerful rugby teams in the world,\u201d said defence coach John Mitchell.\n\n\u201cThey are both strong, well coached, the gain-line is going to be huge.\u201d\n\nEngland dominated it against New Zealand, with man of the match lock Maro Itoje and fearless flankers Sam Underhill and Tom Curry setting the tone with a series of devastating hits.\n\nVunipola said that seeing those dominant tackles and how they put opponents on the back foot was contagious.\n\n\u201cIt shows everyone it can be done, so everyone else tries to follow in the slipstream,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s very easy to sit here and say we want to be brutal, you have to back those words up.\u201d\n\nAnother man likely to be very busy on Saturday is fullback Elliot Daly, though he was sticking to the party line that dealing with De Klerk\u2019s howitzers was a joint responsibility and will be pleased to have wingers Jonny May and Anthony Watson on board as both are excellent under the high ball.\n\n\u201cIn the last couple of games we have faced the least number of kicks in a few months,\u201d Daly said. \u201cWatching how South Africa went about the Wales game there will probably be more aerial threats and it\u2019s something we\u2019ll look at as a team.\u201d", "description": "England's Billy Vunipola is perhaps close to fulfilling coach Eddie Jones' prediction that he could become the best number eight in the world but that has not stopped his aunt offering advice as he heads into the Rugby World Cup final.", "authors": ["Mitch Phillips", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
