Of the millions of tonnes that does get collected in Europe, less than a third is recycled. Belgium based firm ecoBirdy is attempting to change those dismal statistics by turning old plastic toys into safe and sustainable children's designer furniture. The company's products, which include tables, chairs, lamps and containers, are 100 percent recycled and can be easily recycled again.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to set up a business to do good based on social and environmental values and we wanted to create a solution for the problems our world is facing today beyond aesthetics and functionality,\u201d says ecoBirdy co-founder Joris Vanbriel.\n\nNot only is ecoBirdy making money through an innovative solution to an environmental challenge, it is a great example of a company leading Europe\u2019s push towards a so-called circular economy. The idea where nothing need go to waste.\n\nThe firm also has a school programme where it explains to children how plastic recycling works and why it is important.\n\nHelp for SMEs from COSME\n\nEcoBirdy got going thanks to a grant co-funded under the EU\u2019s COSME programme for small and medium-sized businesses.\n\n\u201cIt opened doors to find professional partners and it meant also an acceleration of our concept, and it brought a more profound structure to the plan,\u201d explains Vanbriel.\n\nThe COSME programme has already helped over 450,000 small businesses across Europe get the money they need to start up and grow. 60 percent of the COSME budget is devoted to two financial instruments: one for loan guarantees and one for equity.\n\n\u201cCOSME helps companies access new markets, both in Europe and beyond. It helps them understand European legislation. In addition, there are also financial schemes when the banks don\u2019t want to share the risk,\u201d says Hajar Zamouri from the Enterprise Europe Network Flanders.\n\nFor more expert insight on the how the COSME programme can help SMEs, Business Planet spoke to Hajar Zamouri from the Enterprise Europe Network Flanders.\n\nWhat is the COSME programme?\n\nThe European Commission aims to promote entrepreneurship and improve the business environment for SMEs to allow them to realise their full potential in today\u2019s global economy.

Across the world, plastic waste makes up 85% of beach litter. This in turn generates microplastics in the air and water, with yet unknown impacts on health and the environment.\n\nIn an effort to cut this pollution the European Commission says it has implented measures to turn the challenge of plastic waste into an opportunity for a sustainable future.\n\nThese include the first-ever Europe-wide Plastics Strategy, the ban of single use plastics, the launch of the Circular Plastics Alliance as well as a voluntary pledges campaign.\n\nIn the EU, over 50 million tonnes of plastics are used every year. Over 25 million tonnes of plastic waste are collected every year, but less than a third is recycled.\n\nThe EU has put forward a comprehensive Plastics Strategy, to transform the way plastic products are designed, produced, used, and recycled in Europe. The EU also supports businesses that want to tackle this problem head on.\n\nCOSME aims at promoting entrepreneurship and improving the business environment for European SMEs including their access to finance. 60% of the COSME budget is devoted to two financial instruments: one for loan guarantees and one for equity. It has already supported over 450,000 small businesses across Europe.\n\nCompanies looking for finance can visit the EU www.access2finance.eu website, which offers information on banks, leasing companies, venture capital funds and other financial institutions that provide finance supported by the EU in each country.\n\nUseful links\n\nwww.access2finance.eu\n\nCOSME\n\nPlastics Strategy", "description": "Business Planet travels to the Belgian city of Antwerp to see how one small company is transforming plastic pollution into a designer product.", "authors": ["Paul Hackett"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/14/76/04/1000x563_cmsv2_de15f48d-f271-5a57-8896-fd74ddd89d96-4147604.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
