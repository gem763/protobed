We showed that we are able to stand behind a small state, Ireland, to protect its interests.\u201d\n\nBut Cerar warned that EU\u2019s weekend decision not to open membership negotiations with North Macedonia and Albania sends a negative signal to the volatile Western Balkans.\n\nHe said that \u201cI believe that this postponement or no decision was indeed a historic mistake.\u201d\n\nSlovenia became an EU member in 2004.\n\n___\n\n9 a.m.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk says European Union leaders \u201cwill decide in coming days\u201d whether to grant Britain another extension to the deadline for leaving the bloc, but he says their decision depends on developments in London.\n\nTusk said Tuesday that the decision on prolonging Brexit for three months after Oct. 31 \u201cwill very much depend on what the British parliament decides or doesn\u2019t decide.\u201d\n\nBritain faces another week of political gridlock after British lawmakers on Monday denied Prime Minister Boris Johnson a chance to hold a vote on the Brexit divorce bill agreed in Brussels last week.\n\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker lamented all the work spent on Brexit rather than on EU policy, calling it a \u201cwaste of time and waste of energy.\u201d\n\n___\n\n8:50 a.m.\n\nBritish lawmakers from across the political spectrum are expected to challenge Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s drive to push his European Union divorce bill through the House of Commons by Thursday, potentially scuttling plans to deliver Brexit by Oct. 31.\n\nThe bill faces two votes Tuesday, with lawmakers first being asked to approve it in principle, followed by a vote on the government\u2019s schedule for debate and possible amendments.\n\nWhile many analysts expect the bill to be approved, lawmakers may reject the three-day timetable because of concerns it doesn\u2019t provide enough time for scrutiny.\n\nKen Clarke, a long-time lawmaker from Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party, says \u201cunless you are prepared to contemplate more expansive debate, there is not the slightest possibility of considering the deal that has been obtained within the time available.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow AP\u2019s full coverage of Brexit and British politics at https://www.apnews.com/Brexit", "description": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 The Latest on Brexit (all times local): 2:35 p.m. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says that if lawmakers reject his accelerated three-day", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/22/663836_france-eu-brexit-61336-european-council-president-donald-tusk-delivers-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
