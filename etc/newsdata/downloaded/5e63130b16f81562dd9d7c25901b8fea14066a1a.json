Bloomberg\n\nA police officer couldn't open the doors because the handles were retracted and bystanders watched helplessly as the car filled with smoke and flames, according to the complaint, which alleges the fire originated with the car's battery.\n\nThe door handles on the Model S are flush with the car and pop out - \"auto-present\" in the words of Tesla - when they detect that the key fob is nearby.\n\n\"Fire engulfed the car and burned Dr Awan beyond recognition - all because the Model S has inaccessible door handles, no other way to open the doors, and an unreasonably dangerous fire risk,\" according to the October 10 suit. The complaint lists the cause of death as smoke inhalation and states that Awan had sustained no internal injuries or broken bones in the crash.", "description": "A police officer couldn't open the doors because the handles were retracted and bystanders watched helplessly as the car filled with flames, says a lawsuit.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4013%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_13/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/100247988b670920cb3251e8116f1cf5559a1d8e", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
