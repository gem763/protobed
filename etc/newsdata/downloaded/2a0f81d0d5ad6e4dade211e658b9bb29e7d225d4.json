It was day 19 of the union's nationwide strike against the automaker. Talks were to resume Saturday morning.\n\nIn the letter, Terry Dittes, vice president of union's GM department, wrote: \"Since the last update, we have made good progress regarding the issues of health care and a path for temporary employees becoming seniority members.\"\n\nThe issue of temporary workers making significantly less than permanent workers has been a huge obstacle in talks. The temps, who are paid $15 to $19 an hour, can work for several years without an assurance of a permanent role. The UAW agreed to expanded use of temps at all three Detroit automakers as the industry headed into the recession a decade ago.\n\nTemps are union members, but not eligible for profit sharing and pay more for health care than their peers. A survey of autoworkers last year found that providing equity for them was the union member's No. 1 issue.\n\nGM said, \u201cWe continue to negotiate, exchange proposals and make progress toward reaching a tentative agreement.\u201d\n\nPickup wars rage on: Silverado, F-150, Ram do battle for GM, Ford, Fiat Chrysler\n\nBed Bath & Beyond closings: What you need to know about coupons, returns and gift cards\n\nRemaining issues\n\nDittes also told members the UAW and GM still have \"several of your proposals outstanding and unsettled like wages, job security, skilled trades and pension.\"\n\nOne labor expert said the letter hints of a real possibility of a tentative agreement coming over the weekend. But he warned that the process of collective bargaining means that issues aren\u2019t solved one by one. All the issues must come together in one package.\n\n\u201cUntil that is complete, there\u2019s not a settlement,\u201d said Harley Shaiken, a University of California Berkeley professor who specializes in labor.\n\nShaiken said it's positive that Dittes highlighted the key issues of health care and temporary workers and that talks will continue through the weekend.\n\n\u201cBut there are very key issues yet to be resolved,\u201d said Shaiken. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how things look on Sunday, if not before. It could be that they get close, but yet a key issue continues to divide them.\u201d\n\nOn temp workers, analysts said GM would want to hire enough temps and reduce its health care costs enough to chip out at least $5 an hour in total labor costs \u2013 the sum of all labor costs divided by all hours worked.\n\nThe Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor said nonunion foreign-based automakers that build cars in the United States have an average total labor cost of $50 an hour. They are known to employ a higher number of temps than the Detroit Three. GM's average hourly labor cost in the United States is $63 an hour.\n\nTemps make up about 7% to 10% of GM's hourly workforce, or about 4,100 people.\n\nHealth care is a big piece of those costs, with UAW members picking up just 3% of their expenses, well below the average U.S. worker's 28%. GM early in the talks proposed that workers pay 15%, which was a nonstarter.\n\nGM's costs rolling up\n\nBargainers for both sides have been meeting daily since the contract between GM and the UAW expired at midnight Sept. 14. The union rejected an initial proposal GM made and 46,000 hourly workers went on strike at 12:01 a.m. Sept. 16.\n\nUAW negotiators are also bargaining with Ford and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, which have extended their contracts, while striking and negotiating with GM. The union chose GM as its \"target\" company with which to negotiate a template that it will take to Ford and FCA on major economic and job security issues.\n\nOne strong motivator for GM to want a deal is the cost.\n\nThis strike has cost GM just over $1 billion thus far, said JP Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman on Tuesday. He estimated GM is losing $82 million per day, though East Lansing-based Anderson Economic Group estimates GM is losing about $25 million a day in profit.\n\nStill, many analysts have said that GM has a lot of money, $17.5 billion in cash on hand at the end of the second quarter, and it can weather this strike.\n\nStory continues", "description": "The UAW's lead negotiator with GM says the negotiations still need to address wages, job security and pension issues.", "authors": ["Jamie L.
