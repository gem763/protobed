And I thought \u201cWhat was that?\u201d\n\n\u2018I had all big puss bubbles all along my lower stomach. I freaked out and called my mum and boyfriend.\u2019\n\nKrista was rushed to hospital where medics tried to analyse what was causing the problem and after an emergency life-saving procedure, she was diagnosed with the flesh-eating disease.\n\nKrista\u2019s condition was so severe the bacteria had already eaten through the tissue holding together her intestines and she would have died had she waited any longer for treatment.\n\nKrista spent two weeks in isolation with the infection (Picture: Jam Press)\n\nDoctors said she had picked up the infection during the C-section and was kept in isolation for two weeks.\n\nDuring that time new mum Krista was not allowed to see Sal due to fears the infection could spread.\n\nShe explained: \u2018I couldn\u2019t see my son because he was too little to come to hospital with all the germs and everything.\n\n\u2018As a new mother my whole plan changed. I couldn\u2019t breast feed him because of all the meds I was on.\n\n\u2018I had FaceTimed him to see him, but the main thing on my mind was that he was ok.\u2019\n\nAfter she was finally discharged, Krista, who was still in severe pain, hired a live-in nurse to help her.\n\nKrista is still having surgery and scans (Picture: Jam Press)\n\nAlthough her condition has now improved, Krista still needs surgery and further scans. A nurse also comes to help her twice a week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince her traumatic experience, Krista has urged other mothers who feel pain in the days and weeks after giving birth to seek urgent medical help.\n\nShe added: \u2018After any type of birth, if you don\u2019t feel good and feel you\u2019re not yourself, don\u2019t take it lightly, go get check out.\n\n\u2018Had I just went to my doctors office, and if they took my white blood cell count they would have seen that something was very wrong.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
