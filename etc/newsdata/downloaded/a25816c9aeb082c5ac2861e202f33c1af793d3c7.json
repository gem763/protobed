The watch again comes in 44mm and 42mm sizes, with options for 4G connected versions, and Apple\u2019s ECG heart monitor. There are also a series of new colours, straps and case options, including titanium and ceramic ones.\n\nThe new watchOS 6, announced in June, will also enable more functionality independent of the iPhone.\n\nApple is also continuing its health focus for the watch, which now includes menstrual cycle tracking as part of watchOS 6. It has also launched a research app, with three health research studies \u2013 hearing, women\u2019s health, and heart and movement. The app will allow anyone to enrol and will roll out in the US later this year. Apple said it cannot access information that directly identifies you through the app.\n\nThe Apple Watch has become a sleeper hit, capturing the lion\u2019s share of the small but increasingly important smartwatch market almost immediately on launch in 2015. Since then the line has increased sales year by year, providing an extra revenue stream alongside the firm\u2019s AirPods wireless earbuds, as people continue to hold on to their smartphones for longer and longer.\n\nApple sold 43m Apple Watches over the last two years, according to data from IDC, accounting for nearly 50% of the global smartwatch market.\n\nThe new Apple Watch Series 5 will start at \u00a3399 in the UK or $399 in the US, with 4G models costing from \u00a3499 or $499, shipping on 20 September. Apple is also keeping the older Series 3 available and dropping its price to \u00a3199 in the UK, $199 in the US.", "description": "Latest smartwatch has new health features, case materials \u2013 and can display time all the time", "authors": ["Samuel Gibbs", "Alex Hern"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d602a2d04c8faeb926ea80d381743fdd51595043/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f22b189464c7b37c65afaf88d20e2c9f", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
