But then he ruled out having the family home included in the pension assets test.\n\nSuggesting that equity in the family home can be accessed makes people \u2013 particularly the elderly \u2013 worry that it might be sold out from under them. And people, especially the elderly, value the security, memories and community they have built up in and around the family home.\n\nA new political gotcha game might be to ask the government what questions it is willing to entertain.\n\nNobody wants people approaching the later stage of their lives feeling insecure, especially not the Coalition, which by and large gets a big chunk of these votes. But ruling the proposal out is a squib. An inquiry could be instructed to look at options that respect the sanctity of the family home. It might explore whether homeowners are open to reverse mortgages or examine the idea of the family home as an intergenerational asset that would allow equity to be released in different ways. The point is not what the exact policy suggestions should be, but the ability to consider the big picture and offer new alternatives. A hobbled inquiry can\u2019t do that.\n\nNow the government is doing it again. The NSW Treasurer has asked a panel of experts to consider ways in which the states could work with the Commonwealth to reform taxes and service delivery to ensure that NSW, and potentially other states that like the model, can continue to deliver the services people expect, taking into account the changing requirements and preferences of the population.\n\nThe time is now\n\nAnd already the Prime Minister has ruled out any change to the GST, based on economic analysis undertaken by the government a few years ago. Previous analyses are the sort of input that inquiries, working in good faith towards the best possible solutions, should always be open to considering. A rigorous inquiry will also examine the assumptions on which the analysis was based, in case the broadened terms of reference might change the assessment.\n\nWith so many questions ruled out, a new political gotcha game might be to ask the government what questions it is willing to entertain.\n\nIf ever there\u2019s a time for asking the hard questions, it\u2019s in the first six months of the electoral term, when there\u2019s plenty of time to lay out the challenges and explore acceptable compromises. A government that doesn\u2019t trust itself to communicate with the electorate now will have a hard time explaining its failure to act come election time.\n\nAnd avoiding hard questions now means finding the answers will surely get harder over time.", "description": "The Morrison government needs to break away from its bad habit of failing to consider reform options because of political reasons.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5136%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_421%2C$y_24/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7778825bcefa22f1aaad3fcf6bfd67dc51c455d0", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
