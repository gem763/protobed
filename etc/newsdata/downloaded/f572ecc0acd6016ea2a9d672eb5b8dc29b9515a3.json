As the heat grew in the U.S., Silver tried to walk back the league\u2019s original rebuke of Morey.\n\n\u201cThere have already been fairly dramatic consequences from that tweet, and I have read some of the media suggesting that we are not supporting Daryl Morey, but in fact we have,\u201d Silver said during his visit to Kyodo, Japan.\n\nThe walking back of the apology did not sit well with the Chinese.\n\n\u201cWe express our strong dissatisfaction and opposition to Silver\u2019s stated support of Morey\u2019s right to free speech. We believe any remarks that challenge national sovereignty and social stability do not belong to the category of free speech,\u201d CCTV said on Monday. \u201cWe will also immediately examine all other cooperation and exchanges with the NBA.\u201d\n\nThe cascade of cancellations then occurred in China.\n\nSilver called the Chinese response to the situation \u201cunfortunate.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something we expected to happen,\u201d Silver said in Japan. \u201cBut if that\u2019s the consequence of us adhering to our values, we still feel it\u2019s critically important to adhere to those values.\u201d\n\nSilver also said he understands that the controversy may not die down any time soon.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.", "description": "The Chinese have canceled TV broadcasts and streaming of the NBA's preseason games, as the communist country continues to react to a", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-825062192-640x480-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
