China is continuing to flex its muscle to silence the noise and direct away attention from it. And unfortunately, a lot of companies are caving into the pressure.\n\nReuters\n\n1. Blizzard\n\nOne of the more recent instances of this is with Blizzard, the company behind video games like 'World of Warcraft', 'Overwatch', and 'Hearthstone'. They recently hosted a Hearthstone Championship across the Asia-Pacific region, which was also being streamed live. After pro player Chung \"Blitzchung\" Ng Wai from Hong Kong won, he was invited to an on-stream interview. There he said, \"Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time,\" while wearing ski goggles and a gas mask similar to Hong Kong protesters.\n\nChung 'Blitzchung' Ng Wai\n\nBlizzard responded by rescinding the $3,000 Wai won for the tournament, and suspending him from professional play, using a technicality that allows them to remove a player that \"brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image.\" In the backlash to that, the Blizzard community has shut down its subreddit, tournament players and casters are distancing themselves, and even employees at the headquarters organised a protest.\n\nDon't Miss 265 SHARES\n\n2. Apple\n\nApple is actually guilty of multiple offences. For one, in a recent update, the company removed the Taiwanese flag emoji from iPhone keyboards for users in the Hong Kong and Macau areas.\n\nApple\u2019s region lock of ROC Taiwan flag \ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\uddfc extended beyond CN devices to HK and Macau\u2019s in the iOS/iPadOS 13.1.1 rollout. Interestingly, the new lock only affects the keyboard, and has no problem displaying and is easy to bypass by switching region. https://t.co/RVRKNQyc1l pic.twitter.com/8eQXambiAQ \u2014 \u738b\u535a\u6e90 Wang Boyuan (@thisboyuan) October 3, 2019\n\nThey've also separately gone back and forth on one app in particular in Hong Kong. Made by pro-democracy protesters, the app was meant to crowdfund map data to help them see the locations of live protests as well as police activity.\n\nReuters\n\nApple first rejected the app from their store, saying it was promoting illegal activity, before they acquiesced and finally allowed. Now, it looks like they've turned heel again, taking down the app permanently.\n\n3. Google\n\nDevelopers in Hong Kong recently made a quick game about the protests in the country, called 'The Revolution of Our Times', and released it for Android on Google Play. However, it seems the company has now taken the game offline. The developers were notified that their game was suspended from the Google Play store, with a notice reading, \"We don't allow apps that allow reasonable sensitivity towards or capitalize on a natural disaster, atrocity, conflict, death, or other tragic event.\n\nReuters\n\nAnd that's in addition to other older news that Google worked on a browser specifically for China, one that would have let the government censor and restrict content, as well as possibly linking searches to phone numbers so dissidents could be tracked.\n\n4. TikTok\n\nThis particular entry may not be very surprising, given that TikTok is owned by a Chinese company, ByteDance. At the very least though, how blatant it is might at least raise your eyebrows. Try it for yourself, just search for Hong Kong on the app. You're not going to see anything even remotely related to the unrest or protests. Instead you'll only see saccharine-sweet videos from that location tag.\n\n5. ESPN\n\nESPN meanwhile had senior news director Chuck Salituro send out a memo to employees following a tweet by Houston Rockets' general manager Daryl Morey. Morey posted a tweet in support of the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. Though it was quickly deleted, China was quick to take offense.\n\nReuters\n\nAnchors and reporters are still allowed to talk about the incident, what it could mean for the Houston Rockets' revenue, how you can't expect the NBA to take a political stand, and what not. However, Salituro has specifically told them they can't discuss the actual situation on the ground in Hong Kong.\n\nSpotted by Deadspin, the memo explicitly discouraged any political discussion about China and Hong Kong. Part of that is probably because ESPN has direct ties to China. Tencent, Chinese media giant, is the channel's official broadcaster in the country thanks to a deal cemented back in 2016.\n\n6. Paramount\n\nThere\u2019s a new Top Gun movie coming out. And Maverick is wearing the same leather jacket - only this time it\u2019s Communist Party of China-approved, so the Japanese and Taiwanese flag patches are gone (screenshot on right is from the new trailer)... pic.twitter.com/gUxFNFNUKX \u2014 Mark MacKinnon (@markmackinnon) July 19, 2019\n\nThough not directly related to the current Hong Kong protests, Paramount has also shown it's not above self-censoring in order to keep raking in that sweet sweet Chinese dough. The film studio recently released a trailer for its reboot of 'Top Gun'. In it however, eagle-eyed viewers spotted that something was different about Maverick's military jacket patches.\n\nWhere the original film had Japanese and Taiwanese flags to commemorate a tour of the USS Galveston in Japan and Taiwan, they've now been replaced with generic patches, to soothe Chinese sensibilities.\n\n7. Marvel\n\nSimilarly, when Marvel released 'Doctor Strange', many people were surprised at how the studio had whitewashed one of the comic book's asian characters, the \"Ancient One\". Instead of the original Tibetan monk, we instead got white woman Tilda Swinton in a vaguely monk-like character\n\nIn the comic books, the Ancient One who was the mentor of Doctor Strange is an old man, whereas in Doctor Strange the Ancient One\u2019s role is played by a woman (Tilda Swinton). pic.twitter.com/HoXJVs5Odt \u2014 Marvel Knowledge (@MarvelKnowledge) January 4, 2018\n\n\"He originates from Tibet,\" the movie's screenwriter Robert Cargill said at the time. \"So if you acknowledge that Tibet is a place and that he's Tibetan, you risk alienating one billion people who think that that's bulls**t and risk the Chinese government going, 'Hey, you know one of the biggest film-watching countries in the world? We're not going to show your movie because you decided to get political.'\"", "description": "As the protests heat up in Hong Kong, the effects of its are spilling out to the rest of the world.
