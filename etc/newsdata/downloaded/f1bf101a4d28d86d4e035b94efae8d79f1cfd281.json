The school district had called the disqualification \u201cheavy-handed and unnecessary,\u201d asserting that \u201cour swimmer was targeted based solely on how a standard, school-issued uniform happened to fit the shape of her body.\u201d\n\n\u201cASAA has determined the disqualification was the result of the misapplication of the rule and as a result is being overturned,\u201d the association wrote in a statement, adding that all team and individual points would be restored.\n\nWillis had just won a 100-yard freestyle race Friday when she was disqualified for her suit, a first for Alaska, and the ASAA, which governs athletics in the state\u2019s schools, reminded officials that they must notify a coach before an athlete\u2019s heat if inappropriate attire is observed. \u201cASAA will be granting this request, for the following reasons,\u201d its statement said, citing the 2019-2020 NFHS Swim and Dive Rule Book rule 3.3.2 (Uniforms). \u201cWhile the rules do allow for swimmers to be disqualified (see Rule 3.3 below), the rules clearly state that \u201cwhen an official discovers a competitor wearing illegal attire \u2026 prior to the start of the heat/dive \u2026 the official shall \u2026 notify the coach of the competitor \u2026\u2019 \u201d\n\n[A \u2018curvier\u2019 high school swimmer won \u2014 only to be disqualified because of a \u2018suit wedgie\u2019]\n\nLauren Langford, who coaches swimming at another high school in the area, told The Washington Post that she believes racism, in addition to sexism, may have been a factor because Willis is among the few nonwhite athletes in a predominantly white sport. \u201cAll of these girls are all wearing suits that are cut the same way,\u201d Langford said. \u201cAnd the only girl who gets disqualified is a mixed-race girl with rounder, curvier features.\u201d\n\nWillis did not select the swimsuit \u2014 it was a team uniform issued to her by the school. Although she and her teammates were dressed identically, she was the only one cited for a uniform violation. Annette Rohde, who was working as an official during the meet, told the Anchorage Daily News that another female official said that the bottom of the swimsuit \u201cwas so far up I could see butt cheek touching butt cheek.\u2019\u2019 Rohde predicted that the decision would backfire.\n\nLangford told The Post that the girl, who also won the 200 individual medley and swam on the 400 freestyle relay team that finished first, had been made to feel that her curves were a problem before. Last year, a parent took a photo of her backside and shared it with other parents to demonstrate that girls on the team were wearing inappropriate swimwear. (District officials said Monday that Dimond High\u2019s assistant principal \u201cindicated to the parent who took the photographs that it was not permissible for him to take pictures of others\u2019 children and that he should stop immediately.\u201d)\n\n\u201cThat to me is so inappropriate,\u201d Langford said. She noted that the teen girl has been accused of hiking her suit up on purpose, but suits often ride up unintentionally. \u201cWe have a term for it \u2014 it\u2019s called a suit wedgie,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd wedgies happen. It\u2019s uncomfortable. No one\u2019s going to walk around that way intentionally.\u201d\n\nTypically, rules about appropriate swimsuits are more concerned with designs and materials that might provide a competitive advantage, but there are modesty guidelines. Jewelry is banned, and there are guidelines about the size of American flag decals, as well as school names, numbers, the color of the suits and other things. According to the rule book, \u201cmales shall wear suits which cover the buttocks and shall not extend above the waist or below the top of the kneecap. Females shall wear suits which cover the buttocks and breasts and shall not extend beyond the shoulders or below the top of the kneecap, not cover the neck.\u201d\n\nThe ASAA added that, after consulting the National Federation of State High School Associations, it had sent a letter to all swim and dive officials reminding them that rules require that they must consider whether a swimmer is intentionally rolling up a swimsuit to expose his or her buttocks before they issue any disqualifications (per KTVA):\n\n\u2022 Is the lack of coverage the result of an intentional action by the swimmer? The rule was put in place to curtail swimmers from intentionally rolling up their swimsuits in such a manner as to expose their buttock. ASAA believes students are not intentionally rolling up their swimsuits in this manner. Therefore, we believe the best course of action in implementing this rule is to:\n\n1. Assume school issued uniforms are legal and will remain so.\n\n2. Upon observing a potential swimsuit coverage issue, notify the coach as directed in Rule 3.3.2 Penalties 1 and 2.\n\n\u201cWedgies\u201d happen all the time in swimming and in gymnastics, to name two sports, and Langford noted that male swimmers and divers wear skimpy swimsuits. In August, the NFHS issued a memorandum alerting coaches that \u201csuits are being worn in such a way as to expose the athlete\u2019s buttocks,\u201d and provided an illustrated example of what constituted appropriate coverage. District officials said Monday that Dimond High \u201cmade deliberate efforts over the last year\u201d to meet those requirements \u2014 in particular, picking out the regulation swimsuit that the teen was wearing when she was stripped of her victory.\n\n\u201cIf the suit was a problem, they all should have been disqualified,\u201d Langford said. \u201cBut they weren\u2019t.\u201d\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nA wrestler was forced to cut his dreadlocks before a match.
