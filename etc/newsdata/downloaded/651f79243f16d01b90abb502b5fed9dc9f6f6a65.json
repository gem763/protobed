Bloomberg reported at the time the company hired contractors to transcribe private voice messages sent via its Messenger app. In that case, users had not been alerted to the possibility that their communications might be subject to human review. It was also unclear at the time that some of the clips Facebook had been collecting were coming from Portal.\n\nFacebook confirmed Wednesday that it was indeed collecting audio from Portal users who make a request from the device using the command \u201cHey Portal.\u201d By default, those commands were recorded and stored on Facebook servers, and some of them were transcribed by contractors working with the company to improve the software algorithms used to understand the commands, according to Andrew Bosworth, Facebook\u2019s head of hardware. That practice was paused last month at the same time Messenger stopped using humans to transcribe messages.\n\nFacebook Paid Contractors to Transcribe Users\u2019 Audio Chats\n\n\u201cWe paused human review of the \u2018Hey Portal\u2019 voice interactions last month while we worked on a plan that gave people more transparency and control, including a way to turn it off,\u201d Bosworth said in a statement.\n\nPortal is now reinstating human audio transcriptions but will offer consumers an option to turn off that service in a new version of its Portal software, which will be distributed to existing devices and its updated Portal lineup shipping in October.\n\nThe Messenger transcriptions are separate, Bosworth added, and that program is still on pause.\n\n\u201cThe reason they\u2019re separate isn\u2019t because the back-end systems are separate, it\u2019s because the data is coming in from a different place,\u201d he told Bloomberg in an interview Tuesday. \u201cAnd therefore you have a different kind of user expectation.\u201d\n\nFacebook shares were little changed at $187.49 at 10:34 a.m. in New York.\n\nApple Suspends Listening to Siri Queries Amid Privacy Outcry\n\nThe controversial practice of transcribing user audio clips has gotten a lot of attention in recent months because of privacy concerns. Apple Inc. and Google have both suspended similar human transcription programs, and Bloomberg first reported in April that Amazon.com Inc. was transcribing some commands from its Alexa voice assistant without people\u2019s knowledge. Amazon now lets users opt out of that human review.\n\nFacebook decided to reinstate this practice because it\u2019s important for training the company\u2019s software programs to accurately understand requests, Bosworth says. He\u2019s also aware that the idea of having humans review user audio is unsettling to many people.\n\n\u201cThe consumer reaction the last several months to these practices, not just at Facebook but other companies, gave us insight into the fact that this was something people weren\u2019t entirely comfortable with or weren\u2019t sure about,\u201d he said when explaining the new privacy setting.\n\nFacebook will still collect and transcribe \u201cHey Portal\u201d commands if users don\u2019t change the default settings. Portal\u2019s data usage policy states that the company does collect \u201cvoice queries and commands\u201d after a user wakes the device with \u201cHey Portal.\u201d The policy does not say that those audio clips may be reviewed by third-party contractors.\n\nFacebook Quizzed by Watchdog for Listening to Users\u2019 Chats\n\nThe importance of audio transcriptions and recordings has increased alongside the rise of digital assistants like Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Google\u2019s Assistant. Tech companies improve the accuracy of their software by transcribing millions of clips, which help the machines learn language and speech patterns. The practice has, however, served up a new privacy trade-off: users want the help of smart assistants but not the threat that strangers might be listening to their private conversations or messages.\n\nFacebook does not yet have an advanced standalone audio assistant to compete with the other tech giants, though its Portal device can carry out some basic commands after users wake it by saying \u201cHey Portal.\u201d For more complicated requests, Portal also comes equipped with Amazon\u2019s Alexa software.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc., which last month said it stopped using humans to review and transcribe users\u2019 voice messages, will resume that practice for some audio collected from its Portal video-calling device.Facebook \u201cpaused human review of audio\u201d around August.
