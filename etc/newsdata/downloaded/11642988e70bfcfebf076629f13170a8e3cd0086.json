To 1994. I will explain. Mick Mulvaney, the president\u2019s chief of staff, or acting chief of staff, was talking about Ukraine. Specifically, the president\u2019s dealings with the Ukrainian government. He told the press, \u201cI have news for everybody: Get over it. There\u2019s going to be political influence in foreign policy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImmediately, the Trump-Pence campaign put out a T-shirt, selling it for $30: Get Over It, the T-shirt says \u2014 and there\u2019s Trump hair over the \u201co\u201d in \u201cover.\u201d\n\nFrom 1979 to 1991, Marion Barry was mayor of Washington, D.C. Then he spent a little time in prison. Then, in 1994, he came back, for a fourth term as mayor. He had a message for disgruntled Washingtonians: \u201cGet over it.\u201d\n\nIt was one of the phrases associated with him (and a cleaner one). And now it\u2019s back, baby.\n\n\u2022 A reader sent me an interesting note. American nationalists, he said, seem to have more affinity for nationalists in other countries than they do for their fellow Americans who aren\u2019t nationalists. This strikes me as true. The nationalists \u2014 of whatever nationality \u2014 are internationalists, in a way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBritain\u2019s Nigel Farage has spoken of a \u201cglobal movement.\u201d Two years ago, he traveled to Alabama to campaign for Roy Moore, a Senate candidate. Farage had just come from Germany, where he campaigned for the AfD, i.e., the Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (Alternative for Germany). In Alabama, he told the crowd that Moore\u2019s election was \u201cimportant for the whole global movement across the West that we have built up and we have fought for.\u201d\n\nAnd what does Steve Bannon call his organization, based in Brussels? \u201cThe Movement.\u201d The organization is, of course, international.\n\nSimilarly, supporters of liberal democracy have affinity for one another, wherever they live. I was talking about this on Wednesday with Denise Ho, the pop star from Hong Kong who is in the streets as a democracy activist. For my podcast with her, go here.\n\nLet\u2019s go to early America \u2014 not too early, but to the first half of the 19th century. Last week, I was talking with Richard Brookhiser, my historian colleague, about Henry Clay. Rick quoted what Lincoln said about Clay in his eulogy (1852). Here is a snippet from that remarkable address:\n\nMr. Clay\u2019s predominant sentiment, from first to last, was a deep devotion to the cause of human liberty \u2014 a strong sympathy with the oppressed everywhere, and an ardent wish for their elevation. . . . He loved his country partly because it was his own country, but mostly because it was a free country.\n\nNoam Chomsky is my fellow American. In a sense, however, I have more in common with my fellow advocates of liberal democracy in Timbuktu, say, than with him. Michael Moore and I would seem to be similar. About the same age. White. Male. Both from Michigan. Grew up an hour apart. Surely ate the same foods, rooted for the same sports teams. Those things count. But . . .\n\nYou see what I mean?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 Years ago, I was talking with Robert Conquest, the great historian, about China. Our specific subject was organ harvesting, for there had been serious, alarming reports on this, especially coming from Falun Gong practitioners. Were Chinese authorities really doing this? Harvesting organs? (Yes.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople in free countries are always reluctant to believe human testimony out of police states, Conquest said. When reports of horrors in the new Soviet Union first reached Paris and London, people dismissed them as \u201crumors in Riga.\u201d When reports of the Holocaust circulated, these were \u201cJewish special pleading.\u201d When Cubans reached Florida, they had to be \u201cBatista stooges,\u201d you see. When people stumbled into Hong Kong \u2014 half dead \u2014 they were \u201cwar lords.\u201d\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI thought of this when glancing at this report, published in Haaretz: \u201cA Million People Are Jailed at China\u2019s Gulags. I Managed to Escape. Here\u2019s What Really Goes on Inside: Rape, torture and human experiments. Sayragul Sauytbay offers firsthand testimony from a Xinjiang \u2018reeducation\u2019 camp.\u201d\n\nAbove, I said \u201cglancing at.\u201d Why didn\u2019t I properly read the article? I have read enough, frankly, and written enough. There is ample testimony out of Xinjiang Province, or East Turkestan. I don\u2019t want to hear later that \u201cno one knew.\u201d We know.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 President Trump pinned a tweet. That means, he affixed it to the top of his list of tweets. He must have been especially proud of it, or found it especially important. This is what he wrote, on Wednesday: \u201cThe Never Trumper Republicans, though on respirators with not many left, are in certain ways worse and more dangerous for our Country than the Do Nothing Democrats. Watch out for them, they are human scum!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHuman scum.\u201d For years \u2014 for centuries \u2014 leaders of a certain kind have used such language against their critics and opponents. The language of dehumanization is very old. \u201cVermin,\u201d \u201cfilth,\u201d and all the rest of it. The Communists in Cuba call their opponents gusanos, or \u201cworms.\u201d Police in Hong Kong, committing violence against democratic protesters, call these protesters \u201ccockroaches.\u201d There is a whole lexicon, stretching across the globe.\n\nConservatives know this. We would not accept \u201chuman scum\u201d from a Democratic president. We would say that such language smacked of Communism, fascism, etc. We would say that leaders don\u2019t talk like that in a democracy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump says, of his Republican critics and opponents, \u201cWatch out for them, they are human scum!\u201d I say: Watch out for leaders who talk that way.\n\n\u2022 Turn to the Democrats \u2014 at least to one, Elizabeth Warren. Will Saletan wrote about her in Slate: \u201cIs Elizabeth Warren an Ideologue?\u201d She has a number of gifts, says Saletan: \u201cBut there\u2019s a big risk for Democrats in nominating Warren: that beneath her talents, she has the soul of an ideologue.\u201d\n\nYup.\n\n\u2022 I loved a sketch on Saturday Night Live, parodying the Democratic \u201ctown hall\u201d on gay issues. Juli\u00e1n Castro \u2014 or the actor playing him \u2014 says, \u201cAs a Democrat, I want to apologize for not being gay. But I promise to do better in the future. However, I am Latino, which we can all agree is something.\u201d\n\nPerfect. (To see it, go to 5:54, here.)\n\n\u2022 Harold Bloom, the critic, has his critics, believe me, but here is a warm, eloquent appreciation by Paul A. Cantor, the renowned professor of English at the University of Virginia. Check out the opening:\n\nRarely does a literary critic display the kind of genius and creativity characteristic of the famous authors he analyzes. Harold Bloom, who died at the age of 89 on Oct. 14, was such a critic.\n\nHave a little more (and this is of particular interest, and importance, to conservatives):\n\nHe spent the last decades of his life as the embattled champion of the Western canon, celebrating true artistic greatness in the face of the mean-spirited attacks on traditional authors that had increasingly come to dominate literary criticism in what Bloom dubbed the \u201cSchool of Resentment.\u201d\n\nJust so.\n\nI received a letter from Bloom once \u2014 a letter of recommendation. It was of his student Emmy Chang, who was applying for a job here at National Review. I have never read a better letter of recommendation \u2014 so interesting, so unusual, so stylish. (Handwritten, too.) I kept the letter \u2014 and gave it to Emmy when she left NR.\n\n\u2022 Feel like some nature writing? It\u2019s not my bag, but, dang, did I enjoy reading this article. It\u2019s by Cara Giaimo, in the New York Times. \u201cThe Loudest Bird in the World Has a Song Like a Pile Driver.\u201d Does he ever. And here are the first, delectable paragraphs:\n\nThe pressures of sexual selection have made peacocks gorgeous, wood thrushes sonorous and birds of paradise great dancers. At first glance, the white bellbird doesn\u2019t appear to have benefited similarly. Barrel-chested and big-mouthed, with a long wattle dangling from the top of its beak, this rainforest bird looks more like a Muppet than an avian Casanova. But everyone\u2019s got their thing. According to a paper published Monday in Current Biology, this goofball boasts the loudest birdsong ever recorded. And he must be proud of it, because he sings the most piercing note right into potential mates\u2019 faces.\n\nWell, whatever gets the job done . . .\n\n\u2022 The white bellbird is not nearly as loud as Denis Matsuev, the Russian pianist. I reviewed him, in recital at Carnegie Hall, here. I actually quoted something from the golf world:\n\nArnold Palmer hit the ball hard \u2014 very hard. Once, his fellow golfer Chi Chi Rodriguez said to him, \u201cArnold, I don\u2019t know how the ball can take it.\u201d As I listened to Matsuev, I thought, \u201cI don\u2019t know how the piano can take it.\u201d\n\n\u2022 My friend and colleague David French has left NR for The Dispatch \u2014 the new enterprise started by Jonah Goldberg, Steve Hayes, and Toby Stock. I admire all of those men, all four. But I\u2019m going to \u201cbrag on\u201d David for a minute, as they say in the South.\n\nI believe he represents the best of American conservatism. He has the head and the heart. David is amazingly versatile \u2014 authoritative on domestic policy, the military, foreign policy, the law, and on and on. (Don\u2019t forget sports!) He is also unusually brave, taking slings and arrows from both Left and Right.\n\nA few months ago, he told me, \u201cI\u2019ve been a Reagan conservative since I was 14.\u201d Poor guy. Everyone else shifted and pivoted, and he was stuck with his views \u2014 same as me. We think they are right, though. And if they\u2019re out of fashion for a while \u2014 well, so be it.\n\nThanks for everything, David. And thank you, dear readers. If you want to write to me, try jnordlinger@nationalreview.com.
