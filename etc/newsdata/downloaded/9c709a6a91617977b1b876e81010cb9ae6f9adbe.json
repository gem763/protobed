While ordinary, or classical, computers perform calculations using sequences of bits composed of 1s and 0s, quantum computers encode information using quantum bits, or qubits, that behave according to the strange rules of quantum mechanics. Quantum computers aim to harness those features to rapidly perform calculations far beyond the capacity of any ordinary computer. But for years, quantum computers struggled to match the computing power of a handheld calculator.\n\nIn 2012, John Preskill, a theoretical physicist at the California Institute of Technology, coined the phrase quantum supremacy to describe the moment when a quantum computer finally surpasses even the best supercomputer. The term caught on, but experts came to hold different ideas about what it means.\n\nAnd that\u2019s how you end up in a situation where Google says it has achieved quantum supremacy but IBM says it hasn\u2019t.\n\nBefore explaining what quantum supremacy means, it\u2019s worth clarifying what it doesn\u2019t mean: the moment a quantum computer performs a calculation that\u2019s impossible for a classical computer. This is because a classical computer can, in fact, perform any calculation a quantum computer can perform\u2014eventually.\n\n\u201cGiven enough time \u2026 classical computers and quantum computers can solve the same problems,\u201d says Thomas Wong of Creighton University.\n\nInstead, most experts interpret quantum supremacy to mean the moment a quantum computer performs a calculation that, for all practical purposes, a classical computer cannot. This is the crux of the disagreement between Google and IBM, because \u201cpractical\u201d is a fuzzy concept.\n\nIn its Nature paper, Google claims that its Sycamore processor took 200 seconds to perform a calculation that the world\u2019s best supercomputer\u2014which happens to be IBM\u2019s Summit machine\u2014would need 10,000 years to perform. That\u2019s not a practical time frame. But IBM now argues that Summit, which fills an area the size of two basketball courts at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, in Tennessee, could perform the calculation in two and a half days.\n\nRead: The computers of our wildest dreams\n\nGoogle stands by its 10,000-year estimate, though several computer experts interviewed for this article said IBM is probably right on that point. \u201cIBM\u2019s claim looks plausible to me,\u201d Scott Aaronson, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said in an email.\n\nSo assuming IBM is right, is two and a half days a practical amount of time? Maybe it is for some tasks, but certainly not for others. For that reason, when computer scientists talk about quantum supremacy, they usually have a more precise idea in mind.\n\nComputer scientists distinguish between programs that run in \u201cfast\u201d polynomial time and \u201cslow\u201d exponential time. Fast programs remain fast even when you ask them to chew on a really big number. Slow programs grind down quickly as the size of the problem you\u2019re asking them to solve gets bigger.", "description": "Google says it has reached a major computational milestone.
