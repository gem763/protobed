(AP) - The accrediting body that oversees Liberty University has asked the college for more information about recent news reports that have questioned President Jerry Falwell Jr.\u2019s leadership style and personal business interests, a spokeswoman told The Associated Press.\n\nThe Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges recently sent the Lynchburg, Virginia, university a letter asking it to \u201crespond to the media reports,\u201d Janea Johnson said this week.\n\nJohnson declined to provide details about the contents of the letter or any specific concerns the commission would like addressed, saying the commission doesn\u2019t divulge such communications.\n\n\u201cThe things that are in the media are things we wanted the institution to address to us,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nLiberty spokesman Scott Lamb said the university hadn\u2019t received any communications from the commission yet.\n\nLiberty is the nation\u2019s highest-profile evangelical college. Falwell previously told AP that the news reports stemmed from an \u201cattempted coup\u201d orchestrated by several disgruntled former board members and employees who are leaking internal university communications to discredit him. He said he has asked the FBI to investigate what he considers a criminal conspiracy.\n\nFalwell is the son of the late evangelist the Rev. Jerry Falwell, who founded Liberty and led the Moral Majority, a conservative, religious political action group.\n\nThe younger Falwell was among the earliest Christian conservatives to endorse President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign and has enjoyed close access to the president. He says that support has likely prompted some of the criticism of his leadership style, personal life and business investments that has surfaced in news reports recently.\n\nThe reports, some based on anonymous sources, have described Falwell as a temperamental leader who brokers no dissent and has blurred the lines between the school and his personal business.\n\nJerry Falwell Jr. has helped transform Liberty from a tiny Baptist college into a touchstone institution for evangelicals. Its campus is dotted with sparkling new buildings and the university is flush with cash and real estate holdings in and around Lynchburg.\n\nThe most recently available tax records show Falwell makes about $1 million a year running the school.\n\nOnce Liberty responds to the commission\u2019s inquiry, a staff member will weigh whether any further action is necessary, Johnson said. If that staff member recommends taking action, the commission\u2019s board would consider that at its next meeting in December, she said.\n\nCurrently, Liberty is fully accredited without any sanctions, she said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The accrediting body that oversees Liberty University has asked the college for more information about recent news reports that have questioned President Jerry Falwell Jr.'s leadership style and personal business interests, a spokeswoman told The Associated Press.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Sarah Rankin", "Alan Suderman"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/25/liberty_university_66881_c0-188-6428-3935_s1770x1032.jpg?6cd87d77d0a6d209744519790e7ac8190672e2d1", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
