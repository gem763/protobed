Instead, he took to Twitter to assail ABC News\u2019 Jonathan Karl for pointing out the obvious mistake.\n\nAnd despite having declared the story about his fake news \u201cfake news\u201d, Trump still didn\u2019t let it go. On Wednesday, he used the occasion of a briefing on Dorian preparations by Homeland Security officials to once again claim that he, and not the experts of the National Weather Service, had been right about the storm\u2019s path. He even brought his own evidence.\n\nWhen reporters were called into the Oval Office to witness brief remarks by Trump, Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, and Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Karl Schultz, Trump displayed a National Weather Service map showing Dorian\u2019s projected path\u2026with a twist. The so-called \u201ccone of uncertainty\u201d had been extended to include Alabama by way of a curious pair of lines drawn by a black marker.\n\nTo longtime Trump watchers, the black lines were an obvious sign that the president, who is known to be so fond of the Sharpie brand that he commissioned a set of custom-made black-barreled markers branded with his signature and the presidential seal, personally doctored the map.\n\nIt was the second time in as many weeks that the Trump administration had tried to fabricate evidence to support what the president wanted.\n\nJust one week before, Justice Department lawyers representing Trump and White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham appeared in a Washington, DC courtroom to defend Grisham\u2019s decision to suspend a reporter\u2019s White House press credentials.\n\nThat reporter, Playboy\u2019s Brian Karem, had been pulled into a verbal altercation with former Trump advisor (and recent fish oil pitchman) Sebastian Gorka, after the latter took issue with a joke Karem had made following an event in the Kennedy Rose Garden (disclaimer: this reporter witnessed the event in question and submitted a sworn declaration in the case).\n\nIn a letter explaining her decision, Stephanie Grisham, who has a history of trying to exclude reporters who vex her employers, alleged that a statement by a Secret Service agent who\u2019d been present indicated that the agent had found Karem\u2019s behavior so disruptive that he\u2019d been forced to intervene.\n\nDuring last week\u2019s court bearing, Justice Department lawyers alluded to the agent\u2019s statement to support Grisham\u2019s contention that Karem\u2019s conduct warranted suspension of his credentials. But after a judge ordered the White House to provide him with a copy for his review, they had to \u201crespectfully inform\u201d him that no such statement existed.\n\nFabricating evidence (or implying that evidence exists when it doesn\u2019t) won\u2019t fly in a federal District Court. Only actual evidence matters, and Karem\u2019s attorneys had that in spades. After reviewing that evidence in the form of multiple videotapes, the judge issued an opinion ordering that Grisham restore Karem\u2019s press pass, writing that he \u201c[did] not find the evidence to support the conclusion that a reasonable person would have believed Karem to be genuinely threatening a physical altercation.\u201d\n\nAs of this morning, Trump is continuing to argue that his fabricated evidence justifies the mistake he made on Sunday, and until next November he\u2019ll be able to argue his case in the court of public opinion. But with his poll numbers declining in key swing states, he might soon find that American voters, like American judges, are only receptive to evidence that actually exists.", "description": "With Hurricane Dorian bearing down on the southeastern United States, one might expect to find the president of those United States huddled with the advisers and experts responsible for coordinating the aid the government will make available to those areas which are in the storm's path.
