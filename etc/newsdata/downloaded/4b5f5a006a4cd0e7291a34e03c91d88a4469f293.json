Adam Schiff heads the House Intelligence Committee.\n\n'I wouldn't testify in front of that committee until there is a vote of Congress and he is removed,' Giuliani told The Washington Post. 'Let them hold me in contempt. We'll go to court. We'll challenge the contempt.'\n\nHe has also threatened a lawsuit against Schiff.\n\nSchiff, meanwhile, is looking into punishments for those who defy Congressional subpoenas, including fining those who refuse to comply.\n\nWhite Collar attorney Jon Sale (pictured) is no longer representing Rudy Giuliani\n\n'You could fine someone $25,000 a day until they comply. You can do that. We\u2019re looking through the history and studying the law to make sure we\u2019re on solid ground,' he told Axios.\n\nAnyone who doesn't comply with a congressional subpoena can be held in contempt of Congress. The matter usually goes to the courts from there but is often time consuming process.\n\nSchiff told MSNBC the fines could be 'even quicker than the impeachment proceeding or the court proceeding.'\n\nGiuliani's defiance comes as deputy assistant Secretary of State George Kent, whose duties include oversight of relations with the Ukraine, is testifying behind closed doors to lawmakers about attempts by Trump and Giuliani to persuade Ukrainian officials to pursue investigations into the Bidens.\n\nAs far back as March, Kent was pointing to Giuliani\u2019s role in what he called a 'disinformation campaign' intended to use a Ukrainian prosecutor to smear targets of the president, including then U.S. Ambassador to the Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, whom Trump later fired.\n\nGiuliani's defiance comes as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs George Kent testified to lawmakers about Giuliani's role in Ukraine relations\n\nYovanovitch testified to lawmakers last week.\n\nAdditionally U.S. ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland is expected to testify on Thursday that President Trump gave Giuliani the authority to approve a presidential meeting with the president of Ukraine.\n\nSondland, who was a key figure in communications about handling Ukraine policy, also will testify he met in the Oval Office with Trump, U.S. Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker, and Energy Secretary Rick Perry after he attended Zelensky's inauguration, NBC News reported.\n\nA Trump-Zelensky meeting, which Zelensky in U.S. text exchanges is described as keen to have occur to shore up his own position, would need to get a green light from Giuliani to occur, Sondland will say.\n\nDemocrats expect him to provide crucial information about pressure for Ukraine to investigate the Bidens at a time when the Trump administration was holding back $391 million in U.S. security aid to Ukraine.\n\nAdditionally, national security official Fiona Hill testified Monday that former National Security Director John Bolton called Giuliani a 'hand grenade who's going to blow everyone up.'\n\nAs Trump's personal lawyer, Giuliani has spent months seeking to dig up dirt on Joe Biden's son Hunter's dealings in Ukraine. Hunter Biden took a lucrative post on a board of a Ukrainian energy company, but told ABC News Tuesday he didn't do anything wrong.\n\nFederal prosecutors indicted two Giuliani associates last week on campaign finance violations.\n\nGiuliani told Reuters this week he was paid $500,000 to work for Fraud Guarantee, the company co-founded by Ukraine-born Lev Parnas, who authorities accuse of steering hundreds of thousands of dollars from another source to a pro-Trump super PAC.", "description": "The president's personal attorney and then the vice president refused to hand over documents to the Democrats' impeachment inquiry, potentially giving evidence they are obstructing justice.", "authors": ["Emily Goodin", "U.S. Politcal Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/23/19762970-0-image-a-11_1571179780115.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
