Around 2,000 of those blazes were in the Amazon rainforest.\n\nThe figures come as the latest blow in an environmental crisis that has caused panic across the world, and which led the agenda at the recent G7 summit in France.\n\nMore than 72,000 fires had already been detected across Brazil between January and August \u2013 the highest number since records began in 2013 and an 83 per cent increase on the same period last year.\n\nBecause it is the world\u2019s largest rainforest, the fate of the Amazon \u2013 often called the \u201clungs of the world\u201d \u2013 is widely considered by climate change experts as key to the future of the planet.\n\nIt is a vital carbon store that slows down global warming while providing some 20 per cent of the world\u2019s oxygen. Its destruction \u2013 deliberate or otherwise \u2013 reduces the ability of nature to suck carbon from the atmosphere.\n\nBut Brazil\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, who came into power promising to clear vast tracts of the rainforest for development, had, until last week, remained unmoved.\n\nHe has systematically weakened institutions designed to protect the rainforest, while offering moral support to farmers wishing to turn the land into cattle ranches.\n\nAnd, although he has now placed a 60-day ban on burning and deployed 44,000 troops to fight the ongoing blazes, critics fear it is too little too late.\n\nhttp://players.brightcove.net/624246174001/default_default/index.html?videoId=5837728067001\n\nSupport free-thinking journalism and subscribe to Independent Minds\n\nTasso Azevedo, who runs the deforestation monitoring group Mapbiomas, said the legislation\u2019s focus on fire means developers clearing the forest would continue to legally chop down trees \u2013 and then simply burn them after the prohibition period ended.\n\nWriting in O Globo newspaper, he called for the ban on the use of fire to be extended until the end of the dry season in November.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhat we are experiencing is a real crisis, which can turn into a tragedy that will feature fires much larger than the current ones if not stopped immediately.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nHow Jair Bolsonaro found a friend in Trump while rainforest burned\n\nChildren struggling to breathe from smoke caused by Amazon fires\n\nFood price profiteering is destroying the Amazon\n\n\u2018Worst of the fire is yet to come\u2019 in Amazon, forestry expert warns\n\nMore fires in central Africa than Amazon as deforestation surges", "description": "Almost 4,000 new forest fires were started in Brazil in the two days after the government banned deliberate burning of the Amazon, officials have revealed.Some 3,859 outbreaks were recorded by the country\u2019s National Space Research Institute (Inpe) in the 48 hours following the 60-day prohibition on setting", "authors": ["Colin Drury"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/uhl2Z3G5QRD8A2OWBf36FA--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/a2f6ec67ef86e6fc2eda859815f4077d"}
