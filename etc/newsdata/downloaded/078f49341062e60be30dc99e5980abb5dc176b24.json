Weak China GDP data failed to push the prices of the safe-haven metal higher.\n\nU.S. for December delivery dropped 0.2% to $1,494.95 per ounce by 1:05 AM ET (05:05 GMT).\n\nRisk appetite improved yesterday after the U.K. and the EU announced that they struck a Brexit deal, but concerns about the deal passing grew as markets now worry about U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s chances of winning parliamentary ratification for the deal.\n\nThe Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), whose 10 parliamentary votes Johnson would need to get any deal approved by the Commons, has so far balked at the notion of an effective customs border separating Northern Ireland from the rest of Britain.\n\nMeanwhile, China\u2019s third quarter GDP grew slower than expected. Chinese stocks turned lower following the release of the data but the safe-haven gold were not able to benefit from the report.\n\nOngoing trade war with the U.S. remained in focus.\n\nBeijing said on Thursday that it hoped to agree on a phase on trade deal with the U.S. \u201cas soon as possible,\u201d but warned that Washington must cancel new tariffs for a full trade deal.\n\n\u201cWe hope both sides can continue to work together to advance the negotiations and, as soon as possible, reach a phased agreement and make new progress on canceling tariffs,\u201d said China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce spokesman Gao Feng.\n\n\u201cBoth sides\u2019 ultimate goal for the negotiations is to end the trade war, cancel all additional tariffs,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is good for China, good for the U.S. and good for the world.\u201d", "description": "Gold Prices Fall as Traders Weigh Brexit, China GDP and Sino-U.S. Trade Talks", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEB5405E_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
