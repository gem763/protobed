The star of Netflix\u2019s \u2018Sabrina the Teenage Witch\u2018 reboot, Kiernan has established herself not only as an expert purveyor of the dark arts, but as a bonafide platinum-haired witch expert.\n\nSo it should come as no surprise that Kiernan has been selected as an ambassador for The Sims\u2019 latest expansion, Realm of Magic. It\u2019s a match made in magical heaven, with the game allowing your Sim to become a mystical spellcaster, learning how to cast mischievous hexes on the unsuspecting population of your neighbourhood.\n\nYou could literally create the world of Sabrina Spellman in The Sims (which I\u2019m absolutely going to try), and it turns out the actress herself is keen to take elements of the game into any future seasons of the show too.\n\nWe had the opportunity to chat to Kiernan about how she plays The Sims: Realm of Magic \u2014 and how she enjoys a bit of havoc here and there.\n\nyep, checks out (Image: @BenRealVsWorld)\n\nPEDESTRIAN.TV: How long have you been playing The Sims for?\n\nKiernan Shipka: I\u2019ve been playing The Sims since I was 12.\n\nP.TV: What made you decide to join as a Brand Ambassador for Realm of Magic?\n\nKS: I have always loved the Sims and when they approached me, it felt like a dream come true! It was a no-brainer.\n\nP.TV: Having come from Sabrina, what attracted you to another witchy project?\n\nKS: I\u2019m obsessed with all things witchy and magical, so this next project seemed perfect for all of that. It felt like the right thing to do in conjunction with Sabrina since it was something different (ie. not acting) but stayed on brand with the show!\n\nP.TV: What\u2019s the strangest thing you\u2019ve made your Sims do?\n\nKS: I\u2019ve definitely given my Sims some pretty funky outfits.\n\na real mood\n\nP.TV: If Sabrina was a Sim, what would she be like?\n\nKS: She would be ambitious and stubborn! If she wasn\u2019t a full-time witch, I\u2019d see her partaking in the arts.\n\nP.TV: Do you like to play traditionally (growing a family through generations) or chaotically (causing mayhem and havoc in the neighbourhood)?\n\nKS: I lean towards traditional playing, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with a little havoc every once in a while.\n\nP.TV: Which elements from Realm of Magic would you actually like to see on Sabrina?\n\nKS: More witchy duels!\n\nP.TV: If you could cast a spell to live as a Sim for a day, what would the first thing you do be?\n\nKS: I would probably just walk around town and meet up with new Sims. Socialising as a Sim seems simple compared to real life sometimes!\n\nme @ anyone who tries to socialise with me outside my game\n\nSo there you have it. I don\u2019t know about you, but if we could manage to convince the fancy higher-ups at \u2018The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina\u2018 to get on board with witchy duels becoming a regular feature. Imagine seeing Sabrina face off with her rivals the same way Harry Potter did with Draco.\n\nIconic.", "description": "The star of Netflix's 'Sabrina the Teenage Witch' reboot, Kiernan has established herself as a bonafide platinum-haired witch expert.", "authors": ["Steph Panecasio"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/sabrina-sims-fb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
