The market has hypothesised that this could come in the form of a dividend reinvestment plan, possibly discounted, which would enable the bank to raise equity.\n\nUBS has warned the second-half of 2018-19 will be remembered as the \"high watermark\" for the sector, \"as the outlook deteriorates in an ultra-low rate environment\", banking analyst Jonathan Mott concluded. He also expects the results to be saddled with increased complexity spanning remediation charges, business exits and one-off aspects.\n\nEvans and Partners analyst Matthew Wilson forecasts ANZ's final dividend will be flat at 80\u00a2 a share, but he has Westpac paying 94\u00a2 a share, which is also flat on the previous corresponding period.\n\nMr Wilson expects Westpac to slash the dividend by 18 per cent in 2019-20 (to an annual total of $1.54 a share, much more bearish than consensus which stands at $1.72), but is open to the idea the bank cuts as soon as this week given the pressure on \"its unsustainably high pay-out ratio\".\n\nHe also questioned whether this half just ruled off (on September 30) represents the last period of \"relatively stable\" net interest margins.\n\nUBS sees the ANZ final dividend coming in at 80\u00a2, and expects a hefty reduction at Westpac to 84\u00a2 a share from 94\u00a2. Westpac, Mr Mott believes, may also have to adopt a more conservative return on equity target of 11 to 12 per cent from 13 to 14 per cent, bowing to the reality of the ultra-low rate environment.\n\n\"The RBA has cut rates and they've taken their deposit rates pretty much to zero, so that's a lot of margin pressure for them to navigate,\" Mr Jenneke said of the sector. \"There's also more pressure on the capital side. Whether that's what the RBNZ wants to do, in terms of the capital requirements for that marketplace, or whether it\u2019s what APRA\u2019s trying to do, in tightening overall capital requirements.\"\n\nTreasurer Josh Frydenberg has also directed the competition watchdog to undertake an inquiry into mortgage pricing, examining the banks' refusal to fully pass on interest rate cuts. This includes whether price differences between new and existing customers constitute a \"loyalty tax\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Jenneke, the T. Rowe fund manager, said that from the outside looking in, lending appears wildly competitive. \"Obviously there's a lot of competition on both front book and back book for the banks,\" he said.\n\n\"The good news for the banks is I think the tail risk on the housing market having a nasty correction has now gone away,\" he added. Sydney and Melbourne recorded a preliminary auction clearance rate of 75 per cent on the weekend. This was despite a 33.5 per cent week-on-week increase in the volume of properties \u2013 a total of 2610 \u2013 going under the hammer in Australia's capital cities, according to CoreLogic.\n\n\"The housing market is improving, the RBA has cut rates and the government will stimulate and do what it needs to do, so that side of things has gotten better,\" Mr Jenneke said.\n\nNational Australia Bank reports on November 7.", "description": "As the market returns to within 100 points of its record high, one of the biggest sectors in the Australian index faces a dividend reckoning.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2043%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_108/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/99cbb52092d1c468899d30097571908b3fc9ec0f", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
