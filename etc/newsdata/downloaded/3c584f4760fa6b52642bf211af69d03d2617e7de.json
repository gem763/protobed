(TSX-V:IGX)(OTCQX:IGXT) (the \"Company\" or \"IntelGenx\"), a leader in pharmaceutical films, today announced that an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (\u201cDSMB\u201d) completed its first interim analysis of the ongoing Montelukast VersaFilm\u00ae Phase 2a (\u201cBUENA\u201d) clinical trial in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (\u201cAD\u201d).\n\nThe DSMB reviewed compiled safety data from 25 subjects enrolled in the BUENA trial, 13 of which have completed 26 weeks of daily treatment. The DSMB did not raise any concerns regarding safety and recommended that the trial continue.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased with the DSMB\u2019s positive recommendation and are looking forward to continuing this trial based on preclinical data demonstrating Montelukast VersaFilm\u2019s increased efficacy at higher doses,\u201d commented Dr. Horst G. Zerbe, CEO of IntelGenx. \u201cAs we begin to compile early safety and efficacy data and continue enrollment at our Canadian sites, we also plan to evaluate expanding the trial to the United States with the potential filing of an Investigational New Drug Application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\u201d\n\nRecently, Prof. Dr. Ludwig Aigner\u2019s group at the Paracelsus Medical University in Salzburg conducted additional efficacy testing of Montelukast in an AD mouse model in collaboration with IntelGenx. Overall results demonstrated that the treatment effect was dose-dependent, with higher doses of Montelukast significantly increasing the mice\u2019s cognition in two behavioural tests. Detailed results from this testing will be presented at an upcoming medical conference.\n\nBased on this new preclinical data demonstrating that the efficacy of Montelukast VersaFilm is dose dependent, IntelGenx plans to continue the BUENA clinical trial at an increased daily dose, subject to Health Canada approval.\n\nAbout IntelGenx:\n\nIntelGenx is a leading drug delivery company focused on the development and manufacturing of pharmaceutical films.\n\nIntelGenx\u2019s superior film technologies, including VersaFilm\u00ae, VetaFilm\u2122 and transdermal, allow for next generation pharmaceutical products that address unmet medical needs.
