In response, the government gave the army temporary emergency powers over a vast swathe of surrounding territory, leading to some startling discoveries.\n\nSearches uncovered coca plantations and cocaine laboratories, including in Semuy II's municipality of El Estor, suggesting drug gangs have been operating freely in an area better known for its natural beauty, mining and African palm. The deaths occurred on the fringes of the Pataxte estate that supplies palm oil to Nestle and Cargill, with authorities saying landing strips on the estate had been used by traffickers.\n\n\"We've found landing strips, some of them clandestine. There are some strips that are legal, but there's evidence of planes landing with illicit goods,\" General Luis Alberto Morales, deputy head of the presidential general staff, told Reuters.\n\nMinistry of Defense spokesman Oscar Perez said investigators had also found the remains of torched planes in the wider area, a tell-tale sign the strips were being used for trafficking.\n\nThe discovery is a dramatic development in the drug war that brings fields and laboratories used to make cocaine closer to the U.S. market than ever before.\n\nThe development led Guatemala's interior minister to declare that the country was now a cocaine producing nation - a distinction previously reserved for Andean countries in South America.\n\nImages provided by the government of the army's discoveries show what appears to be a well-built laboratory, which Morales said could produce up to half a tonne of cocaine a day. He said the government had discovered 1.5 million coca plants along with the labs, estimating a street value of $800 million.\n\nSuch numbers may be inflated. While Andean plantations vary widely in density of plants per hectare, it would be hard to fit so many plants on the apparently small areas of land so far discovered by the soldiers in the wake of the killings. Only last year, Guatemala discovered a small field of coca for the first time.\n\nHowever, the discovery of sophisticated laboratories fits with recent trends of Colombian gangs exporting half-processed cocaine to finish the product in countries with less strict policing, said Hernando Bernal, an official from the United Nations drugs and crime agency's illicit crop monitoring program.\n\nThe U.S. embassy in Guatemala declined to comment for this story.\n\n\n\n\n\nFEAR, ISOLATION\n\nThe events of Tuesday, Sept. 3 are murky. Around noon, a patrol of nine soldiers with weapons at the ready tried to cross the village of Semuy II, the first time military officials had been seen in years, locals and authorities agree. At this point, the versions diverge.\n\nAuthorities say the villagers ambushed the soldiers and shot three of them behind the school. Villagers say soldiers sparked a dispute and fired off rounds into the air, and then armed locals opened fire on the soldiers.\n\nHowever, none could say who had fired the fatal shots and no one has been arrested by the investigating authorities.\n\nSpeaking in the hills behind the village where he farms cocoa, community leader Vicente Perez, 43, denied the government's accusation that the villagers were growing drugs and protecting traffickers.\n\n\"Everything the president is saying is a lie,\" Perez said. While he did not witness the shootings, he said it seemed that collective fear led the situation to spiral out of control.\n\nSoldiers and police had not been seen in the area since he was a child, during Guatemala's civil war, he said, adding that the soldiers should have requested permission from the elders of the village before passing through.\n\nAccording to Edgar Caal, a marine who survived the attack, more than a hundred locals waited with shotguns, machetes, sticks and stones, and before attacking issued the patrol a warning: \"Whoever comes to this village is already a dead man,\" he related in a video released by the government.", "description": "Bulletholes scar a wall in the only school in Semuy II, a remote village in northeastern Guatemala where three soldiers were shot dead early in September as they searched for jungle landing strips used by drug traffickers.
