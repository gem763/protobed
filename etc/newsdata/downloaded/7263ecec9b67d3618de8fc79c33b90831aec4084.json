The 29-year-old was at the Redskins\u2019 loss Monday to the Chicago Bears and was spotted in the locker room after the game.\n\nCoach Jay Gruden said Monday he is not worried about Reed having to possibly retire because of the injury.\n\n\u201cWe are just trying to get to the bottom of it and figuring out the best way to make him more comfortable, get him back in the lineup,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cWe are trying to see if there is anything else we can do to try and help him a long in that way to get into practice and start to feel better.\u201d\n\nThe Redskins have not indicated when they expect Reed to return. The tight end hasn\u2019t been able to fully practice while in concussion protocol.\n\n\u201cIf he has to see a specialist every day, I really don\u2019t care,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cThe big thing is to get him healthy and make sure he has a great state of mind so when he does come back he feels really good and confident that this thing will not linger.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
