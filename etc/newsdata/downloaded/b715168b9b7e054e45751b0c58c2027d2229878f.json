The sun rises, the cock crows and more details leak on the Google Pixel 4. Where previous civilisations used such unsophisticated methods as flowing water, running sands and swinging pendulums to measure the passage of time, today we do so far more accurately by recording the seepage of information from Google.\n\nThe latest leak comes courtesy of Best Buy Canada, which briefly posted, and promptly pulled, a pre-order page for the Pixel 4 range that confirmed many of the past leaks, including a Snapdragon 855 processor, 6GB of RAM and dual rear cameras (12-megapixel main and a 16-megapixel telephoto) for both the regular Pixel 4 and premium XL model. A reference to \"Smooth Display\" also appears to confirm the Pixel 4's 5.7 inch and XL's 6.3 inch screens will have 90Hz refresh rates.\n\nWhile it was up, the pre-order page only offered Pixel 4s with 64GB of storage in black or white, although 128GB versions and coral Pixel 4 models are widely expected. There was also no details on price or availability, so it's not clear how soon after their announcement the phones will actually be released, nor how much they'll set you back.\n\nHowever, we won't have long to wait to learn more. The Made by Google '19 event in New York is at 1am AEST October 16, and should include full details on the Pixel 4 phones, as well as the Pixelbook Go, Google Nest Mini and possibly Pixel Buds 2.
