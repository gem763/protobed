Its worse-than-expected second-quarter numbers reported in mid-July gave credence to the overarching bear thesis on NFLX stock. Specifically, the bears say that Netflix\u2019s growth outlook is deteriorating as its competition heats up.\n\n3 Reasons Netflix Stock Is Still the Best Pick in Streaming More\n\nSource: Flickr via Mike K.\n\nSince that earnings report, Netflix stock has shed 20%, falling to $290. Excluding the late 2018 market wipeout, NFLX stock now trades at its lowest levels in about 18 months.\n\nI think this big selloff is an opportunity to buy Netflix stock. That\u2019s because multiple data points imply that its Q3 numbers will be much better than those awful Q2 numbers. Indeed, it looks like Netflix\u2019s Q3 report will look a lot like every other quarterly report the company has issued over the past few years. If so, that will add credence to the idea that its bad Q2 numbers were an outlier, not the new norm. Investors will rush back into NFLX stock as that idea gains credibility.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nI don\u2019t think the current low valuation of Netflix stock will last very long. It will probably only continue for another month or so, until NFLX reports strong Q3 numbers. As a result, I think investors have about a month left to buy NFLX stock at a marked discount.\n\nThe Downloads of Netflix\u2019s Mobile App Are Accelerating\n\nThere are four major indicators that NFLX will report much-improved Q3 numbers, boosting NFLX stock. The first of those factors is that the downloads of Netflix\u2019s mobile apps have significantly re-accelerated in Q3.\n\nSpecifically, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch, downloads of the mobile apps in Q3 are up 18% year-over-year, with the popularity of the domestic app rising 6% and demand for the international app jumping 21%. All three of those numbers are significantly higher than the Q2 rates. Also of note, downloads of Netflix\u2019s app are up 30% in Q3 from Q2.\n\nSo downloads of the company\u2019s mobile apps \u2013 which slowed meaningfully in Q2 \u2013 have re-accelerated in Q3 to more \u201cnormal\u201d levels. This implies that the company\u2019s Q3 numbers will be quite good. It also corroborates the thesis that Netflix\u2019s growth outlook is not permanently slowing.\n\nInternet Searches for Netflix Are Accelerating\n\nThe second major indication is that global internet searches related to Netflix have similarly re-accelerated in Q3 to more \u201cnormal\u201d levels after a material slowdown in Q2.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\n\n\nSpecifically, according to data from Google Trends, global searches related to NFLX have jumped over 8% YoY in Q3. That\u2019s up from just 3% YoY search growth in Q2. Importantly, the third quarter\u2019s 8% growth is more consistent with the company\u2019s usual performance.\n\nThus, Q3 search-interest data indicates that: 1) the large Q2 slowdown has not continued into Q3, and 2) the ugly Q2 report was just a minor road bump for NDLX stock, while its overall growth outlook remains healthy and non-cyclical.\n\n\n\n\n\nManagement Sounded a Bullish Tone\n\nThe third main point is that in mid-July, Netflix\u2019s management was very bullish about Q3 subscriber growth trends and delivered very strong Q3 guidance.\n\nThis is important for two main reasons. First, when NFLX issued that guidance, the quarter\u2019s hit show \u2013 a third season of Stranger Things \u2013 had already been released. Presumably, that series was the quarter\u2019s biggest catalyst for subscriber growth. Thus, when management issued the bullish Q3 guidance, it was already largely aware of the impact of Stranger Things on subscriber growth. That impact was clearly positive and was likely a factor behind the bullish guidance.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Once a Wall Street favorite, streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) has been under tremendous pressure on Wall Street over the past several months.
