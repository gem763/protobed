I was disappointed.\"\n\n(Image: Brett D.

Given what she now knows about him it was inevitable he would sell a story to try to publicise himself,\" her rep told us.\n\n\"Kris and Kate are over Charles, who is behaving like the little boy he is.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Charles has savagely insinuated that Katie has cheated as he returned to Instagram with a not-so-subtle message for her.\n\n\"Sleeping alone is better than sharing your bed with someone who shares their bed with someone else when you're not around,\" he posted on his Story.\n\n\"Especially if they are married.\"\n\nMirror Online has contacted Katie's rep for comment.", "description": "Katie Price has been left raging after her toyboy lover Charles Drury told the world she's not up to much in the sack", "authors": ["Emmeline Saunders", "Image", "Brett D.
