The team wanted an academy member to throw a first pitch in the World Series \u2014 as itdid during last year\u2019s All-Star Game and on a past Opening Day \u2014 and the academy chose Freeman.\n\nAD\n\nTal Alter, chief executive officer of the academy, met Freeman five years ago, when she applied to the academy, and watched her grow and mature into a young leader as the captain of her team, Hustle Softball.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s really embraced the opportunity that she\u2019s been given,\u201d he said. \u201c[She] has the awareness at her age to think about what responsibilities that gives her.\u201d\n\nThe eighth grader is from Ward 7, where the academy is, and has been attending the academy since the third grade. She didn\u2019t like softball at first \u2014 she cried at the first practice two years ago \u2014 but she watched and listened as coaches explained nuances of the game. Now, she pitches and plays shortstop, and she just bought a new, gray baseball glove because she wore out the laces on her old one.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat a moment!\n\n\n\nMade possible by a million moments of hard work fueled by coaches, mentors, and family.\n\n\n\nCongratulations, Janyia! You are outstanding!#NatsAcademy | #Nats4Good pic.twitter.com/YjeJgKeeIc \u2014 Nats Youth Academy (@NatsAcademy) October 27, 2019\n\nFreeman prepared for the moment by practicing throwing with Gaby Elvina, a former Georgetown softball catcher who now coaches at the academy. She got familiar with a mound. She knew there would be familiar faces cheering her on from behind the plate: her mother, Keyonna Bennett; her grandmother, Stephanie Royal; her best friend and fellow academy member, Jayla Hines; and Elvina. Another familiar face, Nationals third baseman Anthony Rendon, caught the pitch.\n\nOn the field Saturday night, she grinned while talking about her softball team. She wanted to throw a strike. She fidgeted with the strap on her glove.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really excited,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd kind of nervous.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut she remembered what her coaches had said: \u201cStay focused, try my best and just be me.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The academy is the Nationals' signature philanthropic effort.", "authors": ["Sam Fortier", "Sports Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/pIqwBCkcuoZA-Fpd8E0obU8zAQI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LSR2U5HYJUI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
