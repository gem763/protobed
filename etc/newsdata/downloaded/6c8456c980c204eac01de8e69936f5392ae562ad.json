Players can get their hands on hacker Crypto, a brand new weapon, and a slew of battle pass goodies alongside extensive changes to the game\u2019s Ranked mode when season three, called Meltdown, arrives October 1.\n\nToday\u2019s \u201cStories from the Outlands\u201d cinematic isn\u2019t the first time Apex Legends players are hearing of the elusive upcoming character. Crypto\u2019s name and abilities were first revealed by dataminers before he was teased in the season two launch trailer. The tech-based legend made his in-game debut earlier this week by way of a brief Easter egg in the new Singh Labs area of the map. The cinematic suggests that Crypto has arrived in Kings Canyon to save, or possibly avenge, a missing friend.\n\nMeltdown will also introduce a new energy weapon known as the Charge Rifle and an updated Battle Pass with new rewards.\n\nThere will also be updates to Ranked mode, which include a soft reset that will reduce everyone\u2019s ranked position by 1.5 tiers, slight adjustments to scoring, and increases to the amount of ranked points it will cost to play in higher-tier Silver matches and above.\n\nPlayers can also expect rank-indicating badges to return, as well as new cosmetic rewards like gun charms and dive trails that also show off how high they\u2019ve climbed in the rankings. And after deactivating the feature in the first season of Ranked mode to avoid false positives, Respawn plans to implement harsher matchmaking penalties for abandoning teammates in the middle of a game in the next season.\n\n\u201cOverall, we\u2019re really happy with how the introduction of Ranked Leagues has worked out, and we\u2019re excited for what we can learn and adjust as this second wave gets out to players,\u201d the official announcement states.", "description": "Respawn has officially revealed the next champion slated to join Apex Legends.
