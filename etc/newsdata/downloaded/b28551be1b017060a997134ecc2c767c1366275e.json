Powell said this latest cut was 'appropriate,' indicating there would likely be no more cuts this year, after facing increased pressure from Trump to lower rates as the nation goes into the 2020 presidential elections.\n\nThe fed cut the rate by 25 basis points to a range of 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent, as had been expected. Powell said it was 'insurance' against on-going risks.\n\nFed Chairman Jerome H. Powell (pictured) announced on Wednesday the Federal Reserve's third interest rate cut this year. He said the adjustment was 'appropriate,' indicating there would likely be no more cuts this year\n\nPresident Donald Trump, via Twitter, had renewed his attacks on the Fed leading up to Wednesday's announcement, for not lowering its benchmark rate closer to zero the last time an adjustment was made in September\n\nInterest rates on home mortgages, auto purchases and other debt typically follow adjustments made to the Fed benchmark.\n\nIn this case, lowering the interest rate will likely make it cheaper for Americans to borrow money. Home prices have begun rising after the Fed lowered the rate twice since July.\n\nThe announced third cut this year reverses four rate hikes that the Fed made last year in response to a strengthening economy.\n\nPowell said lowering the rate again was 'insurance', or protection needed because 'weakness in global growth and trade developments have weighed on the economy and posed ongoing risks'.\n\nHis remarks referred to Trump's still unresolved trade war with China and weaker growth in Europe and Asia.\n\nThe Fed's signalling of a pause in rate cuts means there likely won't be any more cuts this year, as 'incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with our outlook', Powell said.\n\n'If developments emerge that cause a material reassessment of our outlook, we would respond accordingly. Policy is not on a pre-set course'.\n\nPowell previously pointed to similar rate cuts in 1995 and 1998 as precedents; in both cases, the Fed cut rates three times.\n\nThe key issue leading up to the rate cut was whether the Fed was taking out enough insurance.\n\nTrump, via Twitter, had renewed his attacks on the Fed leading up to Wednesday's announcement, for not lowering its benchmark rate closer to zero the last time an adjustment was made in September.\n\nPresident Donald Trump increased pressure on the Fed to lower interest rates as the nation goes into the 2020 presidential elections. Even after the last adjustment in September, Trump tweeted criticism (pictured) of Fed Chairman Jerome H. Powell for not lowering it more\n\n'Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve Fail Again. No 'guts,' no sense, no vision! A terrible communicator'! Trump wrote on Twitter.\n\nTrump has contrasted the Fed's actions unfavorably with central banks in Europe and Japan, which have slashed their rates into negative territory.\n\nThough Trump has suggested that this puts the United States at a competitive disadvantage, most economists regard negative interest rates as a sign of weakness.\n\nSome international tensions have eased since the Fed's last meeting in mid-September, which might suggest that further rate cuts are less necessary.\n\nThe US and China reached a temporary trade truce earlier this month and are working on a preliminary agreement that could be signed by Trump and President Xi Jinping in November.\n\nIt's not clear, though, how meaningful any such agreement might be, and Trump hasn't dropped his threat to impose new tariffs on Chinese goods on December 15.\n\nAnother source of international tension has been Brexit, which has also eased.\n\nThe European Union agreed Tuesday to delay the deadline for Britain's exit from the trade bloc to January 31 from this Thursday.\n\nThat postpones what could have been a disruptive exit, right after the Fed meeting concluded, that would likely have damaged the UK and European economies.", "description": "The federal reserve went ahead with a third interest rate cut as protection against on-going risks in the world, including the trade war with China which could still end up hurting the US economy.", "authors": ["Ralph R.
