The pair were pictured together in 2010\n\nA new TV documentary is set to re-examine claims Prince Andrew joined in an orgy with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and nine young women.\n\nVirginia Roberts, now Virginia Giuffre, made the allegation - which the Prince vehemently denies - in court papers in 2015.\n\nNow a new investigation by Channel 4's Dispatches has re-examined the court papers and looked at Ms Roberts' medical records from around the time she says she was abused.\n\nThe programme cites a court deposition made in January 2015 as part of a defamation case brought by Epstein's former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, where she states that the 'third time' she had 'sex with Andy' was 'in an orgy on Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands'.\n\nShe said she was 18 at the time and that 'approximately eight other young girls, and I had sex together'.\n\nShe said Epstein had joked that the girls couldn't communicate well due to a language barrier and that he said they were the 'easiest' girls to get along with.\n\nThe Channel 4 programme has since obtained medical records from the 9th of July 2001 after suffering 3 weeks of vaginal bleeding.\n\nVirginia Roberts (centre) claimed she had sex with Prince Andrew (left) several times and that it had once involved other girls. Ghislaine Maxwell is pictured, right\n\nThe TV documentary looks into 1,200 pages of documents made public to a Manhattan court.\n\nMs Roberts' evidence was thrown out in May 2015.\n\nEarlier this year Buckingham Palace said: 'Any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.' and 'It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact with Virginia Roberts. Any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation.'\n\nThis is while Prince Andrew said: 'At no stage during the limited time I spent with him did I see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction.'\n\nThe programme also unearths claims that Epstein had '13 contact numbers for Prince Andrew' in an address book.\n\nDiscovered at his mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, the address book was found to have contact details for several of the Duke of York's residences, including Buckingham Palace.\n\nThe latest revelation in the investigation will come as a blow to Prince Andrew, who has continuously denied witnessing Epstein doing anything illegal during their friendship.\n\nPrince Andrew has previously denied being aware of any of Epstein's illegal activities. He is pictured above in 2010 answering the door of Epstein's New York mansion\n\nOne of the first investigators to examine allegations that Epstein had sexually abused and trafficked girls, Mike Fisten, has now claimed the book is a 'treasure trove' of information, and has been able to show investigators the true scope of Epstein's travels and contacts.\n\nMr Fisten said that the book took them out of South Florida and all around the world.\n\nHe said: 'You could take for instance, if looking at the section in London, you could pick out, the Duke of York, which is Prince Andrew. And when you look at that, under Duke of York it shows Buckingham Palace London.'\n\n'He has thirteen phone number to contact the Duke. And (these numbers went everywhere), Wood Farm, Sunninghill Wood Farm, Sunninghill numbers, the Palace, his home number, his home email. He even had a phone number to his modem, I guess to call into his modem.'\n\nPrivate investigator Mr Fisten was one of the first to interview Virginia Roberts, who has made claims that Prince Andrew had sex with her when she was 17.\n\nA view of Jeffrey Epstein's stone mansion on Little St. James Island (pictured above)\n\nDuring an interview with the Channel 4 programme, Mr Fitsen makes clear that vulnerable girls were targeted and that there had been no way you could have been around Epstein and not have been around such people.\n\nHe added: 'When people tell me, I didn't know what Jeffrey was about, I don't want to say BS. I'll just say hogwash. Because if you were around Jeffrey you were around underage girls. He has no children. He has no nieces\u2026 Come on. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that something was going on there.'\n\nThe programme also highlights Ms Roberts' alleged encounter with Prince Andrew on Caribbean Island Little St James.\n\nGhislaine Maxwell (above) laughed off the claims, according to the programme\n\nMr Fisten said: 'It was a private island and we could never get access to it so we never knew for sure what was going on.\n\n'We knew that he had a helicopter on the mainland, and he would shuttle himself, his guests and girls back and forth to the island\u2026 he felt that he had free rein over there. (So I as an investigator knowing how Jeffrey is and his insatiable appetite for underage girls I can only imagine what was going on on that island.)'\n\nThis is while a friend who had been visiting the island in 2005 said he had been 'astonished' as he anchored his boat at the Island, and several women approached them on jet skis.\n\nIt has also previously been claimed that Epstein's house keeper in Palm Beach had seen Prince Andrew visiting the mansion three or four times, and claimed that he would receive massages from girls who were staying there.\n\nOn the Dispatches programme tonight, Mr Fisten says he was shocked by what he found during his enquiries.\n\nHe said that some girls confessed to him that they would wear the same outfit to school every single day and that they barely had enough food to eat. This he says, was exactly the type of girl Epstein had been looking for.\n\nJeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell pictured together in New York in 2005\n\nIt had previously been stated that Ms Maxwell has helped procure the women for Epstein and the programme spoke to a friend of Ms Maxwell's and Epstein's, who said Epstein had defended the allegations to her.\n\nConchita Sarnoff said :'I called him\u2026 and I said Jeffrey, what happened? Why are these girls saying all these things to the police and he said well Conchita you know how poor girls are, they just want my money, they are trying to extort me for money'\n\nShe said she didn't believe him and that there had been too many filed and documents produced at the time which ruled against him.\n\n'That you know made me realise that he was just not telling me the truth. Of course, once I found out about Jeffrey well, I called her.\n\n'I said to her, 'Ghislaine, I've been reading through these files and your name is all over\u2026 all over these files. You better get yourself a lawyer. 'And she laughed on the phone. I'll never forget. You know she laughed her typical, you know, giggle. And she said don't be ridiculous. That's ridiculous. I'm fine.'\n\nThe programme also addresses a conversation which took place between Peter Mandelson and Epstein while the tycoon was in jail for sex offences.\n\nPeter Mandelson (pictured above) is said to have called Epstein while he was in jail in 2009\n\nAn anonymous friend of Epstein recounted that he had spoken to someone with the name 'Petie', who turned out to be the then Labour Business Secretary, who is said to have been securing a meeting for Esptein with JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon.\n\nThe source said: 'I must say I was astonished that a British cabinet minister at that time, probably the most powerful man other than the Prime Minister, was calling Jeffrey in jail to make an appointment, to seek an appointment with a very powerful banker in New York.'\n\nLady Victoria Hervey (pictured above) Epstein 'collected people'\n\nThe documentary gives sheds further light on the scandal and socialite Lady Victoria Hervey, who had previously been on dates with Prince Andrew claimed there had been 'many men' like Epstein.\n\n'Andrew was kind of like newly single. And he meets this, you know, charismatic man\u2026. Jeffrey\u2026 collected people. He was almost addicted to collecting important people. He liked to impress people. So, the British royal family, can you imagine? This was his, you know, biggest kind of trophy he could get.\n\nJeffrey, you know, yes, he did all this stuff, but there's like so many guys like him. You know, just go to St Tropez or anywhere flashy in the summer. There's going to be the older guy with a harem of girls around him'", "description": "Virginia Roberts, now Virginia Giuffre, made the allegation - which the Prince vehemently denies - in statements as part of a Manhatten court case in 2015.", "authors": ["Terri-Ann Williams", "Richard Spillett For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/08/19949294-0-image-a-2_1571556087890.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
