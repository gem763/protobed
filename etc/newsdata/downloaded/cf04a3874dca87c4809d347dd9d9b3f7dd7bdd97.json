The scenes on the street, it said, were a \u201cstreet revolt to bring Islamic immigrants to Poland\u201d and backed by EU leaders as revenge for the refusal of PiS to accept migrants under a European relocation scheme.\n\nAnother programme on the channel, part of a network funded by a mix of TV licence revenues and advertising, described opponents as \u201cdefenders of paedophiles and alimony-dodgers\u201d.\n\nSuch language has been par for the course since PiS passed legislation to give itself direct control of the public broadcaster soon after its victory in parliamentary elections in 2015, raising concerns about Poland\u2019s media environment ahead of Sunday\u2019s parliamentary election. Aggressively partisan news coverage routinely portrays the government\u2019s opponents as scheming to frustrate the will and wellbeing of the Polish people, as embodied by PiS. Government policies are \u201cgood for Poles\u201d while the opposition\u2019s are \u201cempty promises\u201d.\n\nWith just days left of a campaign in which PiS has tried to mobilise its conservative base with attacks on LGBT rights, TVP is set on Thursday night to broadcast a self-styled documentary called Invasion which promises to reveal \u201cthe inside story, aims, methods, and money behind the LGBT invasion\u201d of Poland.\n\nThe struggle for LGBT equality: Pride meets prejudice in Poland Read more\n\nIt has also repeatedly claimed the opposition is intent on impoverishing ordinary Poles by rolling back welfare programmes and deliberately negotiating a less generous financial settlement from the EU.\n\nAn analysis of the content of TVP\u2019s flagship evening news programme by Poland\u2019s Society of Journalists found that in the two weeks before the May European elections, of the 105 items about the polls, 69 items were focused on PiS, of which 68 were classified as positive and one as neutral. Every one of the 33 items about the opposition was negative.\n\nA separate study, conducted by the Council for the Protection of the Polish Language, a body affiliated with the Polish Academy of Sciences, also found that TVP was systematically portraying the ruling party in a positive light. Items relating to PiS routinely used words such as \u201creform\u201d, \u201csovereign\u201d, \u201cstrong\u201d, \u201chero\u201d, and \u201cpatriotic\u201d, while items about the opposition tended to deploy words such as \u201cshocking\u201d, \u201cscandalous\u201d, \u201cprovocation\u201d and \u201cputsch\u201d.\n\n\u201cI am old enough to remember Communist-controlled television in the 1980s, and I can safely say that what we have now is cruder, more primitive, and more aggressive than anything that was broadcast at that time,\u201d said Rafa\u0142 Pankowski, a professor at Collegium Civitas in Warsaw and director of the Never Again association, an anti-racism campaign group. \u201cSadly, many people are influenced by it.\u201d\n\nOn several occasions, the broadcaster\u2019s outlets have engaged in crude acts of censorship to spare the government\u2019s blushes. Barack Obama\u2019s concerns about PiS\u2019s attempts to assert direct control over the country\u2019s highest constitutional court expressed at a 2016 Nato summit in Warsaw were edited in such way that only his praise for Poland was broadcast.\n\nCritics also accuse PiS of using TVP to promote narratives that range from the casually offensive to the incendiary. One regular guest on a political debate show recently claimed that \u201cleftist\u201d advocates of abortion rights were demanding the right to kill children up to the age of three years old. The claim went unchallenged.\n\nEuropean elections: sex and religion dominate campaigning in Poland Read more\n\nTVP is overseen by Jacek Kurski, a former PiS MEP appointed after the Polish parliament voted in 2015 to remove the broadcaster\u2019s senior management and give the power of appointment to the country\u2019s treasury minister.\n\nHundreds of journalists were subsequently dismissed. Since PiS took office in 2015, Poland has fallen from 18th to 59th place in the Reporters Without Borders World Press Freedom Index.\n\nPiS leaders and supporters argue that the party\u2019s control of TVP is a necessary and proportionate response to what it argues is a wider media environment skewed in favour of its liberal opponents.\n\nPointing to the fact that many private media outlets are foreign-owned, they argue this leads them to serve the interests of foreign countries rather than those of Poland.\n\nMedia freedom may deteriorate after the election. Observers note that a convincing majority in Sunday\u2019s elections would allow PiS to introduce long-touted anti-monopoly legislation designed to impose new limits on the stake that can be held by a foreign company in Polish media outlets.\n\nKrzystof Czaba\u0144ski, the former PiS MP who heads Poland\u2019s National Media Council, has claimed that some private media outlets constituted \u201cthe armed wing of the political opposition\u201d and asked: \u201cWhen media belonging to German capital attack our government \u2026 whose national interests they are implementing?\u201d\n\n\u201cPiS claims that they want to ensure pluralism in Polish media,\u201d said Jacek Kucharczyk, president of Poland\u2019s Institute of Public Affairs. \u201cIn fact, the plan seems to be to force foreign owners to sell their shares in media to state-controlled companies or PiS-friendly oligarchs.\u201d", "description": "Government-run broadcaster that condemned pro-freedom protests to show anti-LGBT film days before election", "authors": ["Christian Davies"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f85985e683a47d4f7b73ad7924fbc011873d2d57/0_27_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7177e551751ade32b8f6a20b9d919248", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
