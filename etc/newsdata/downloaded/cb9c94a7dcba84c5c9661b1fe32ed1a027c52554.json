Ella reaction to seeing Josh!\"\n\nA third joked: \"Ella saying 'OMG WHO THE F*** ARE YOU\" is the highlight of this season.\"\n\nAfter Ella and Busayo embraced in an extended hug, the pair sat down down to discuss why Busayo became a catfish.\n\nShe confessed: \"I'm glad it didn't work to be honest, it is bitter sweet.\"\n\nWhile Ella said she understood why Busayo did it, she admitted that it \"broke her heart\".\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\nElla also confessed that she thinks Busayo would have gone further if she played The Circle as herself.\n\nAt the beginning of the episode, Ella advised \"Josh\" to open up to the group in a bid to squash last night's Catfish accusations.\n\nHowever, the rest of The Circle were not convinced after Busayo incorrectly answered questions about cricket.\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\nBefore entering The Circle, Busayo revealed she was joining the show to \"shed light on white privilege in social interaction\".\n\nThe reality TV hopeful built a profile as \"Josh\", a single 24-year-old from Camden, in order \u201cto test the theory of white, male privilege\u201d.\n\nShe previously believed \"Josh\" would be more popular than if she would have played as herself.\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\nAt the end of the show, a shocking alert teased that Sammie and Tim will head to The Hangout to choose another player to block in tomorrow's episode.\n\nIn a game where anyone can be anyone, players of the show live in the same building but reside in completely different apartments.\n\nBut the players never meet face to face and communicate only via social media platform The Circle in a bid to be voted the most popular by other contestants.\n\n*The final of The Circle takes place this Friday on Channel 4 at 10pm.", "description": "Contestant Busayo was blocked from tonight's show in the final week as the \u00a3100,000 prize is still up for grabs", "authors": ["Tiffany Wallis", "Image", "Channel"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20587791.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_EMB-EH_CHP_151019The-Circle-_1477JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
