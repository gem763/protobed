Rose will become the first female boss of a top four British bank and her appointment brings the total number of female FTSE 100 CEOs back to the heady heights of 2017 when the tally stood at... seven. That\u2019s right: seven. As in one more than six, one less than eight and very definitely not in double digits.\n\nOver the last decade, there has been a lot of focus on the need for more equality and diversity in the boardroom. In 2010, Dame Helena Morrissey founded the 30% Club in an attempt to propel female representation at board level out of the single digits. Her campaign has been successful, with the figure now standing at 29.9 per cent.\n\nWhilst Morrissey\u2019s achievement and the appointment of Rose should not be overlooked, it does beg the question, how the hell can progress be so slow?\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nA recent report from the Chartered Institute of Professional Development showed that there are more men named Steve or Stephen occupying CEO positions in the FTSE 100 than there are female CEOs. There are also as many Daves / Davids as there are women and those women who make up that 7 per cent of FTSE 100 CEOs earn just 4.2 per cent of total pay.\n\nThis is not just a problem at an executive level \u2013 a YouGov poll survey for Young Women\u2019s Trust last month found that one in eight employers said they would be \u201creluctant to hire women who may have children\u201d \u2013 despite the fact it is illegal to make hiring decisions on this basis. And when making a decision relating to career progression or promotion, one in seven employers said their business mulls over the woman being a mother or if she is pregnant \u2013 again, this is illegal. The escalating costs of childcare mean that many women walk away from their careers as they can often wind up in a situation where they are paying to go to work.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 14 women using social media to change the world Show all 14 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

What followed was a viral social media campaign, #1000blackgirlbooks, calling for titles featuring black girls as protagonists to be donated. Nearly 4,000 books were donated, and Dias now tackles prejudice and advocates for diversity in literature. Getty 2/14 Rina Sawayama @rinasonline Rina Sawayama came in a blaze of neon and sci-fi coolness in early 2016 when she released the single 'Where U Are', which explored how humans interact with digital media. Since then, the singer and model from north London has been a trailblazer for intersectional feminism. Whether it\u2019s singing about her experiences as a pansexual woman or starting Twitter conversations about cultural appropriation in the media, Sawayama has taken both the music world and social media by storm with her politically vibrant work. A quick look at her Instagram account (@rinasonline) will reveal a confident woman who is not afraid to voice her opinions to her 141,000 followers. Getty 3/14 Chidera Eggerue @theslumflower At only 24 years old, Eggerue came to prominence with her viral 2017 social media campaign #SaggyBoobsMatter. 'It was only small-boobed women who were \u2018allowed\u2019 to not wear a bra,' the author said in an interview with The Guardian. \u201cI couldn\u2019t understand why \u2026 I had to challenge it.\u201d Her decision to not wear a bra shouldn\u2019t be deemed radical, yet here she is in 2019 challenging the ideas that women are pressured to confirming too. Women of all ages and shapes use the hashtag to show pride in themselves, as a result of the body positivity Eggerue championed. Her blog, The Slumflower, also discusses sexism, feminism and racism. Getty Images 4/14 Scarlett Curtis @scarcurtis You may know her as the writer who exposed Philip Green\u2019s willingness to profit off feminism but reject the idea of having a pink pop-up stall in Topshop back in October 2018. However, Scarlett Curtis is a trail-blazing feminist in other ways too. The author of Feminists Don\u2019t Wear Pink & Other Lies co-founded The Pink Protest \u2013 a collective helping young feminist activist to take action online \u2013 in 2017, all while using her social media to challenge misogyny whenever she encounters it. Getty 5/14 Tarana Burke @TaranaBurke Also known as the mother of the #MeToo movement, Tarana Burke is an American social activist who is largely responsible for the international movement against sexual harassment that went viral in October 2017. The phrase was first used in 2006 on Burke\u2019s Myspace account after she responded to a 13-year-old girl who had been sexually assaulted. The hashtag gained traction after actress Alyssa Milano encouraged victims of harassment to tweet the phrase. The call-out followed sexual abuse allegations against disgraced film producter Harvey Weinstein and has been used at least 19 million times on social media. Burke is a life-long activist for victims of sexual assault and harassment and continues to campaign such issues on social media. She has single-handedly changed the conversation on sexual violence. Getty 6/14 Sophie Sandberg @catcallsofnyc Tired of being unable to walk down the street without being constantly catcalled by men, activist Sophie Sandberg took to Instagram to expose an epidemic rife in society. Armed with multi-coloured chalk, she began documenting the horrific words that had been said to her all over New York in late 2016. Talking to the BBC about the project she stated: 'By writing [catcalls] in the same place that it happened, I hope the words may remember and think \"Oh those were my words\".' Women around the globe have been inspired by Sandberg\u2019s work and Instagram accounts of women chalking messages have since sprung up from Columbia to Bangladesh. Sophie Sandberg 7/14 Hannah Witton @hannahwitton Hannah Witton is a sex-positive YouTuber and author who has vlogged candidly about sexual health, relationships and women\u2019s issues since 2011.

It began in 2015 with an Instagram account and now serves as a place to discuss topics affecting women without any fear of judgement. It has since grown into a weekly podcast and a series of organised events that have brought women together from across the globe. Talking to the BBC about the project, Aboah noted: 'At school there still isn\u2019t a place for girls and boys to realise they\u2019re not alone \u2026There is a light at the end of the tunnel. I promise that.' Getty 9/14 Laci Green @gogreen18 YouTuber Laci Green has been educating her subscribers on the nuances of sex education for over 10 years and has amassed over 1.4 million subscribers. The vlogger's videos, which are prominent in the sex-positive movement due to their candour, cover topics such as birth control, hormones and abortion in an attempt to remove the stigma surrounding them. Green is also very outspoken against slut-shaming and sexual harassment, being one of the first YouTubers to address the sexual harassment claims levied against vlogger Sam Pepper in 2014. Getty 10/14 Ash Sarkar @AyoCaesar From describing broadcaster Piers Morgan an 'idiot' to declaring herself a communist on Good Morning Britain, Ash Sarkar is a dynamic journalist making waves on the internet and TV. The north London native champions the rights of women and immigrants on social media, with a Twitter account that is rife with political commentary with a humorous edge. Meanwhile, her Instagram showcases all her campaigning work including protests on climate change and Brexit. Sarkar is also a senior editor at Novara Media \u2013 an independent, radical left-wing news organisation. Ash Sarkar 11/14 Gina Martin @ginamartin Writer and activist Gina Martin hit national headlines when she began a viral campaign to make 'upskirting' illegal. Taking to Facebook, Martin explained how a man took photos of her crotch without her permission and got away with it in a post that subsequently went viral in 2017. She then launched a petition for her case to be reopened and for the action to be made part of the 2003 Sexual Offences Act. Using the hashtag, #StopSkirtingTheIssue, the petition managed to get over 100,000 signatures. As of 2019, 'upskirting' is now illegal and this is largely down to the efforts of Martin. The activist continues to promote feminist causes to her 40,000 Instagram followers. AFP 12/14 Rowan Blanchard @rowanblanchard When Rowan Blanchard isn\u2019t taking over the world of acting, she\u2019s taking to Twitter and Instagram to talk to her 5.1 million followers about various activist pursuits. The 17-year-old uses her platform to discuss social and economic issues, with topics as diverse as human rights and gun control, and isn\u2019t afraid to give a voice to those who haven\u2019t been heard.

Getty\n\nCombine this depressing reality with the fact that women are more likely to take on caring roles than men (58 per cent of 6.5m unpaid carers in the UK are women). Women aged 45 to 54 are twice as likely as other carers to have reduced working hours as a result of caring responsibilities. These statistics show that women continue to suffer at every stage of their career due to circumstances out of their control.\n\nApril 2019 marked one year since the introduction of government rules regarding pay disclosure and yet there is not a single sector in the United Kingdom\u2019s economy where women are paid more than men \u2013 there isn\u2019t even a sector where pay is at parity. A quarter of companies have a pay gap of over 20 per cent in favour of men.\n\nI started my career in journalism reporting on the business sector and now over ten years later, it feels as though we have barely moved at all \u2013 oftentimes it feels as though we are taking one step forwards and two or three back.\n\nAs Cheryl Giovannoni, chief executive of the Girls\u2019 Day School Trust, said at the \u201cPreparing Young Women for a World of Radical Change\u201d summit this week, \u201cIf you look at the statistics, girls outperform boys at school, they outperform them at university and they start to fall behind very early on in their careers.\u201d Women are less likely to ask for a pay rise or for a promotion, especially if they don\u2019t consider it a nailed-on certainty that they would get it.\n\nGiovannoni made the point that teachers need to \u201cwork really hard on \u2026 giving girls the confidence to see their self-worth...whether they are confident enough to ask for what they believe they\u2019re worth is not always the case..\"\n\nBut other research shows that women do ask for raises, and they still don\u2019t get them. Whatever way you look at it, women are not coming out on top. A couple of years ago, I was asked to take on a more senior role when a male colleague left the company for which I then worked. It was a step up in terms of responsibility as well as the size of the team I managed and I was thrilled to get a pay rise to reflect this. And yet, they paid me just 56 per cent of what my male predecessor earned. Upon learning of this discrepancy, I asked for the issue to be resolved. There was no difference in our contributions to the business. It was not resolved and so I left the company.\n\nAny improvement or progression has to be a combined effort from women and men, parents and teachers, employers and mentors. Young women need to have confidence instilled in them from a young age, through education and the success of their own hard work and application. The world needs to stop seeing young women with self-belief and a certain amount of competence as a threat, self-important or a cheaper form of labour. We need to stop seeing mothers as distracted or less dedicated, simply because they\u2019re not always physically in the workplace.\n\nThen hopefully, in the not-so-distant future, we will see a pipeline of women leading more of the biggest companies in the country \u2013 not just seven\u2026", "description": "RBS has confirmed that Alison Rose will assume the role of chief executive from November.
