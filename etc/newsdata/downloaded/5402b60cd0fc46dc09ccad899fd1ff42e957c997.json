Here was a guy who for decades called for bombing North Korea and Iran, exercising unilateral American power around the world, and cutting tethers to international institutions.\n\nBolton actually had a thought-out worldview that in many ways mirrored Trump\u2019s. The question was if the top aide could channel the president\u2019s instincts into actions that he has long wanted an administration to embrace.\n\nIn some cases, he succeeded. Trump last year withdrew the US from the Iran nuclear deal, an agreement Bolton railed against and wanted torn apart since Barack Obama signed it. And this year the president backed an effort to remove Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro \u2014 a socialist dictator that Bolton has repeatedly criticized \u2014 from power.\n\nBut Bolton is most known for openly and passionately calling on the US to bomb nations he deems irredeemably dangerous. North Korea and Iran held a special place in his heart, writing that America should attack them for pursuing nuclear weapons and even advocating regime change. Doves worried aloud that missiles would start flying soon after Bolton stepped foot inside the Oval Office.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t to be, thankfully.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the one that tempers him\u201d\n\nDespite Bolton\u2019s best efforts, Trump pursued diplomatic talks with North Korea and resisted escalating tensions despite a resumption in missile tests over the last few weeks. And even after reimposing crushing sanctions on Iran, Trump repeatedly said he\u2019d be willing to negotiate a \u201cbetter\u201d nuclear deal with the Islamic Republic\u2019s top officials.\n\nThere\u2019s little indication Trump wants to ignite another war in the Middle East despite his tough Iran stance. In fact, the Washington Post reported Tuesday that Bolton was \u201cdevastated\u201d Trump chose not to attack Iran after it downed an American surveillance drone in June.\n\nWhich means that Bolton surely got to Trump on some issues, but failed to convince him to start fights the world over. All he really received for his efforts was open ridicule.\n\n\u201cI disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration,\u201d Trump tweeted on Tuesday when announcing the top aide\u2019s ouster. That echoed the president\u2019s comments from four months ago when he told reporters \u201cI\u2019m the one that tempers him. That\u2019s okay. I have different sides. I have John Bolton and other people that are a little more dovish than him.\u201d\n\nIt goes to show that Trump is in control of the most important aspect of his foreign policy: whether or not to go to war.\n\nHe has certainly threatened conflict before, going so far as to risk nuclear war with North Korea to persuade Kim Jong Un to come the negotiating table (remember \u201cfire and fury?\u201d). And he\u2019s more willing to use military force than Obama, twice bombing Syria and escalating airstrikes on ISIS and other terrorists worldwide. He\u2019s even continued and augmented US support for Saudi Arabia\u2019s war in Yemen.\n\nStill, Trump has walked back every chance he\u2019s had to escalate to the highest level tensions with adversaries. That was always going to put Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d in conflict with Bolton\u2019s \u201cAmerica Everywhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere Trump and Bolton seemed to clash the most was on the extent to which aggressive US military intervention should accompany a hawkish foreign policy posture, and then also on the role of diplomacy,\u201d says John Glaser, a US foreign policy expert at the Cato Institute in Washington, DC.\n\nWhich brings up the question: Why did Trump pick Bolton in the first place? The answer seems to be that Bolton defended Trump\u2019s foreign policy on Fox News and was a known commodity within Republican circles. The president seemingly wanted an attack dog for himself, but ended up hiring a person who wanted to attack others for real.\n\nTrump\u2019s foreign policy is in shambles, with or without Bolton\n\nThe natural instinct is to assume that Trump\u2019s foreign policy will improve with Bolton out the door. The problem is that Bolton didn\u2019t really change Trump \u2014 the president still pursued profoundly Trumpian policies.\n\nHe\u2019s tried to cozy up to Russia despite its attacks on American democracy. He\u2019s lambasted traditional, long-standing allies from Europe to Asia for not contributing enough to their own defense \u2014 losing their trust and respect in the process. He\u2019s mostly forgotten about the hundreds of millions of people that could use American support in Africa. And his trade war with China has hurt the global economy and many of his own supporters in rural areas.\n\nBut what he consistently stopped short of was engaging in full-scale war with any adversary. That may be because Trump and Bolton had different views on using force. Bolton wanted bombs to drop in service of regime change and the display of American unilateral power. Trump used threats of violence as a way to look tough and make it appear he was actively decisively.\n\nTrump and Bolton were therefore simpatico on a lot, but it was on war that they differed.\n\nBolton tried to change Trump\u2019s mind on that. He failed \u2014 and got fired for it.\n\nListen to Today, Explained\n\nJohn Bolton is out.
