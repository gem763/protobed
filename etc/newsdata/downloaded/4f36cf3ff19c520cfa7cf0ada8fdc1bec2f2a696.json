I said, ''Is he OK? I think there's something wrong''.'\n\nThe couple were told their son Archer would have to spend 12 months in hospital following his surgery\n\nSurgeons at the Queensland Children\u2019s Hospital performed a tracheostomy, where they inserted a tube into Archer's windpipe, allowing him to breathe while he sleeps, the publication reported.\n\nHe's expected to require the breathing machine for the rest of his life.\n\nIt took a fortnight before Mrs Wallbank was finally able to hold her son again, but she was 'scared' due to all the machines and tubes Archer was connected to.\n\nAs everything continue to pile on the new family, they didn't expect to be told that Archer would also have to spend 12 months in hospital.\n\nThis meant they couldn't go back home to the Sunshine Coast and raise their son to be a 'surfer baby' like they wanted to.\n\nDespite all the struggles and health complications Archer has gone through, his parents consider themselves 'quite lucky' for coming this far\n\nIt was particularly hard as well being far from family and friends and adapting to their new life.\n\nThe family are now staying in a rental house in southeast Brisbane, and are hopeful they can one day live back near family and friends.\n\nThey bought Archer a Peppa Pig toy who also has a tube in her throat, and use the toy to speak to Archer, to help explain his situation.\n\nDespite all the struggles and health complications Archer has gone through, his parents consider themselves 'quite lucky' for coming this far.", "description": "Summer Wallbank and Tom Howe from the Sunshine Coast, welcomed baby Archer Howe on December 17, 2017 and did not expect to be planning Christmas in intensive care.", "authors": ["Sahar Mourad For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/15/19334540-0-image-a-14_1570285461559.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
