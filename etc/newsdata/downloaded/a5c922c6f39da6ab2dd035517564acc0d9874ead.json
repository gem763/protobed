But, in the past few months, I\u2019ve more often found myself awake at night with true fear-for-your-kids anguish. This spring, we set another high mark for carbon dioxide in the atmosphere: four hundred and fifteen parts per million, higher than it has been in many millions of years. The summer began with the hottest June ever recorded, and then July became the hottest month ever recorded. The United Kingdom, France, and Germany, which have some of the world\u2019s oldest weather records, all hit new high temperatures, and then the heat moved north, until most of Greenland was melting and immense Siberian wildfires were sending great clouds of carbon skyward. At the beginning of September, Hurricane Dorian stalled above the Bahamas, where it unleashed what one meteorologist called \u201cthe longest siege of violent, destructive weather ever observed\u201d on our planet. The scientific warnings of three decades ago are the deadly heat advisories and flash-flood alerts of the present, and, as for the future, we have hard deadlines. Last fall, the world\u2019s climate scientists said that, if we are to meet the goals we set in the 2015 Paris climate accord\u2014which would still raise the mercury fifty per cent higher than it has already climbed\u2014we\u2019ll essentially need to cut our use of fossil fuels in half by 2030 and eliminate them altogether by mid-century. In a world of Trumps and Putins and Bolsonaros and the fossil-fuel companies that back them, that seems nearly impossible. It\u2019s not technologically impossible: in the past decade, the world\u2019s engineers have dropped the price of solar and wind power by ninety and seventy per cent, respectively. But we\u2019re moving far too slowly to exploit the opening for rapid change that this feat of engineering offers. Hence the 2 A.M. dread. There\u2019s good news, too: as the crisis grows more obvious, far more people are joining in the fight. In the year since the scientists imposed that deadline, we\u2019ve seen the rise of the Green New Deal, the cheeky exploits of Extinction Rebellion, and the global spread of the school strikes started by the Swedish teen-ager Greta Thunberg. It seems that there are finally enough people to make an impact. The question is, what levers can we pull that might possibly create change within the time that we need it to happen? Some of us have begun to change our own lives, pledging to fly less and to eat lower on the food chain. But, whatever our intentions, we\u2019re each of us currently locked into burning a fair amount of fossil fuel: if there\u2019s no train that goes to your destination, you can\u2019t take it. Others\u2014actually, often the same people\u2014are working to elect greener candidates, lobbying to pass legislation, litigating cases headed for the Supreme Court, or going to jail to block the construction of pipelines. These are all important efforts, but we need to do more, for the simple reason that they may not pay off fast enough. Climate change is a timed test, one of the first that our civilization has faced, and with each scientific report the window narrows. By contrast, cultural change\u2014what we eat, how we live\u2014often comes generationally. Political change usually involves slow compromise, and that\u2019s in a working system, not a dysfunctional gridlock such as the one we now have in Washington. And, since we face a planetary crisis, cultural and political change would have to happen in every other major country, too. But what if there were an additional lever to pull, one that could work both quickly and globally? One possibility relies on the idea that political leaders are not the only powerful actors on the planet\u2014that those who hold most of the money also have enormous power, and that their power could be exercised in a matter of months or even hours, not years or decades. I suspect that the key to disrupting the flow of carbon into the atmosphere may lie in disrupting the flow of money to coal and oil and gas. Following the money isn\u2019t a new idea. Seven years ago, 350.org (the climate campaign that I co-founded, a decade ago, and still serve as a senior adviser) helped launch a global movement to persuade the managers of college endowments, pension funds, and other large pots of money to sell their stock in fossil-fuel companies. It has become the largest such campaign in history: funds worth more than eleven trillion dollars have divested some or all of their fossil-fuel holdings. And it has been effective: when Peabody Energy, the largest American coal company, filed for bankruptcy, in 2016, it cited divestment as one of the pressures weighing on its business, and, this year, Shell called divestment a \u201cmaterial adverse effect\u201d on its performance. The divestment campaign has brought home the starkest fact of the global-warming era: that the industry has in its reserves five times as much carbon as the scientific consensus thinks we can safely burn. The pressure has helped cost the industry much of its social license; one religious institution after another has divested from oil and gas, and Pope Francis has summoned industry executives to the Vatican to tell them that they must leave carbon underground. But this, too, seems to be happening in too-slow motion. The fossil-fuel industry may be going down, but it\u2019s going down fighting. Which makes sense, because it\u2019s the fossil-fuel industry\u2014it really only knows how to do one thing. So now consider extending the logic of the divestment fight one ring out, from the fossil-fuel companies to the financial system that supports them. Consider a bank like, say, JPMorgan Chase, which is America\u2019s largest bank and the world\u2019s most valuable by market capitalization. In the three years since the end of the Paris climate talks, Chase has reportedly committed a hundred and ninety-six billion dollars in financing for the fossil-fuel industry, much of it to fund extreme new ventures: ultra-deep-sea drilling, Arctic oil extraction, and so on. In each of those years, ExxonMobil, by contrast, spent less than three billion dollars on exploration, research, and development. A hundred and ninety-six billion dollars is larger than the market value of BP; it dwarfs that of the coal companies or the frackers. By this measure, Jamie Dimon, the C.E.O. of JPMorgan Chase, is an oil, coal, and gas baron almost without peer. But here\u2019s the thing: fossil-fuel financing accounts for only about seven per cent of Chase\u2019s lending and underwriting. The bank lends to everyone else, too\u2014to people who build bowling alleys and beach houses and breweries. And, if the world were to switch decisively to solar and wind power, Chase would lend to renewable-energy companies, too. Indeed, it already does, though on a much smaller scale. (A spokesperson for Chase said that the bank has committed to facilitate two hundred billion dollars in \u201cclean\u201d financing by 2025, but did not specify where the money will go. The bank also pointed out that it has installed 2,570 solar panels at branches in California and New Jersey.) The same is true of the asset-management and insurance industries: without them, the fossil-fuel companies would almost literally run out of gas, but BlackRock and Chubb could survive without their business. It\u2019s possible to imagine these industries, given that the world is now in existential danger, quickly jettisoning their fossil-fuel business. It\u2019s not easy to imagine\u2014capitalism is not noted for surrendering sources of revenue. But, then, the Arctic ice sheet is not noted for melting. The last minutes of a football game are different from the rest; if you are far enough behind, you dispense with caution. Since gaining a few yards cannot help you, you resort to more desperate, lower-percentage plays. You heave the ball and you hope, and, every once in a while, you win. So a small group of activists has begun probing the financial industry, looking for chances to toss the kind of Hail Mary pass that could yet win this game. The odds are definitely long, but just talking with these groups has begun to lift my despair. Banking\n\nAround the turn of the century, a California-based environmental group called Rainforest Action Network (RAN) was trying to figure out how to slow down the deforestation of the Amazon. It found that Citigroup, then the largest bank on earth, was lending to many of the projects that cut down trees for pastureland, and so it ran a campaign that featured celebrities cutting up their Citi credit cards. Eventually, Citigroup joined with other banks to set up the Equator Principles, which the participants call a \u201crisk management framework\u201d designed to limit the most devastating lending. At some point in the campaign, RAN started paying twenty-four thousand dollars annually to rent a Bloomberg terminal, the financial-information monitor that sits on any broker\u2019s desk, allowing her to track stock prices, bond issues, and deals of every type. \u201cOur Bloomberg rep is always flabbergasted when he visits us,\u201d Alison Kirsch, a climate-and-energy researcher with RAN, told me. \u201cEssentially, we use it backwards.\u201d The terminal will spit out the current league tables, which rank loan volume: showing, for example, which banks are lending the most money to railroad builders or to copper miners\u2014or to fossil-fuel companies. \u201cThe banks all want to be at the top of those tables,\u201d Kirsch said. \u201cIt\u2019s how they keep score.\u201d But RAN turns the tables upside down. Every year, after six months of detailed analysis, it publishes a thick report called \u201cBanking on Climate Change,\u201d which ranks the financial giants according to how much damage they\u2019re doing. This year\u2019s edition, the tenth, shows Chase in the lead, as usual, followed by Wells Fargo, Citi, and Bank of America. Two Japanese banks and the British giant Barclays are also among the top ten, but it\u2019s mostly a North American club\u2014three Canadian banks round out the list. And the trend is remarkable: in the three years since the signing of the Paris climate accord, which was designed to help the world shift away from fossil fuels, the banks\u2019 lending to the industry has increased every year, and much of the money goes toward the most extreme forms of energy development. In the lead-up to the Paris talks, a team of scientists published a big paper in Nature that listed the planet\u2019s most catastrophic deposits of hydrocarbons, the ones that should be left in the ground at all costs. It included Arctic oil and the tar-sands sludge found in northern Alberta; Chase has aggressively funded the extraction of both. According to RAN, the bank\u2019s largest single energy-sector client is TC Energy (until recently known as Transcanada), which is trying to build the Keystone XL pipeline, which would stretch from the tar sands to the Gulf of Mexico\u2014a project that President Obama rejected and that the NASA scientist James Hansen said would be the start of a \u201cgame over\u201d scenario for the climate. (Chase would not comment.) Jason Ope\u00f1a Disterhoft, RAN\u2019s senior campaigner, told me, \u201cIt\u2019s a climate moment. We\u2019re in a process, as a society, of naming the actors most responsible for driving the climate crisis, and banks are absolutely on that list. And Chase\u2014they\u2019re No. 1 with a bullet, right at the top of the list of who should be held accountable.\u201d So what would happen if, tomorrow, Chase announced that it was going to phase out lending to the fossil-fuel industry\u2014probably first by restricting loans for particular projects, and then by ending general corporate lending and banning the underwriting of new debt and equity for fossil-fuel companies? \u201cWells Fargo and Citi would follow within days,\u201d according to Tim Buckley, a former managing director at Citi, who now serves as the director of energy-finance studies for Australasia at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (I.E.E.F.A.), a Cleveland-based nonprofit research group. In fact, \u201cthey\u2019d look to go one step further, so as to pretend they weren\u2019t really sheep. And this would have global ramifications\u2014the music would stop, very suddenly.\u201d Wall Street, Buckley said, \u201ccan be very deaf to warnings for years, but the financial-market lemmings will suddenly act in unison\u201d once the biggest players send a signal. Everyone knows that the fossil-fuel era will come to an end sooner or later; a giant bank pulling back would send an unmistakable signal that it will be sooner. The biggest oil companies might still be able to self-finance their continuing operations, but \u201cthe pure-play frackers will find finance impossible,\u201d Buckley said. \u201cCoal-dependent rail carriers and port owners and coal-mine contracting firms will all be hit.\u201d Done badly, this halt could wreak chaos: the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, warned four years ago that the \u201cstranded assets\u201d\u2014the coal, gas, and oil that need to be left underground\u2014amount to a twenty-trillion-dollar \u201ccarbon bubble\u201d that far exceeds the housing bubble that sparked the 2008 financial conflagration. Carney has been diligently trying to deflate the bubble ever since, in hopes of avoiding another crisis. That\u2019s why it might make sense for Chase and the others to first announce that they were ending loans for the expansion of the fossil-fuel industry, while continuing to extend credit for ongoing operations. \u201cIf Chase does what we\u2019re asking for and other banks follow,\u201d Alison Kirsch said, \u201cthe impacts of that social signal would be significant immediately, while the economic impacts from transitioning off of fossil fuels would happen over time.\u201d And it must be said that, even if bursting this bubble did short-term damage to the economy, that damage would pale next to the kind of wreckage forecast for the planet if the fossil-fuel industry continues on its current path for another decade. Even in economic terms, twenty trillion dollars is paltry compared with the sums that experts now think unabated global warming would consume. At the moment, the planet is on track to warm more than three degrees Celsius by century\u2019s end, which one recent study found would do five hundred and fifty-one trillion dollars in damage. That\u2019s more money than currently exists on the planet. Is there any chance that Chase might halt its fossil-fuel lending? Perhaps not. The bank grew into a global giant under the leadership of David Rockefeller, the grandson of John D. Rockefeller, who established the country\u2019s original oil fortune, by founding the Standard Oil Company, one of whose successor companies is ExxonMobil. For many years, the Chase board\u2019s lead director has been Lee Raymond, who served as the C.E.O. of Exxon during the years when it was working hardest to cast doubt on the reality of global warming. (In 1997, Raymond gave an infamous speech, in Beijing, in which he claimed that the planet was probably cooling, and that, in any event, it was \u201chighly unlikely that the temperature in the middle of the next century will be affected whether policies are enacted now or twenty years from now.\u201d) However, in 2016, the Rockefeller Family Fund announced that it would divest from fossil fuels, singling out Exxon\u2019s conduct as being \u201cmorally reprehensible\u201d and adding that \u201cwe must keep most of the already discovered reserves in the ground if there is any hope for human and natural ecosystems to survive and thrive in the decades ahead.\u201d The director of the Rockefeller Family Fund, Lee Wasserman, says that it\u2019s time to take on the reputations of the bankers, in much the same way that the Sackler family has increasingly been shunned for its role in the opioid crisis. \u201cWhen the neighborhood tavern serves up several rounds to an already drunken patron, and the inebriated person rams into a minivan loaded with Little Leaguers, it\u2019s not only a tragedy\u2014the bar may be sued out of business, and the bartender could face jail time,\u201d he said. \u201cHow much morally worse is it to enable the expansion of a deadly fossil-fuel industry, whose business model is certain to cause the death and suffering of millions of people and the loss of much of the earth\u2019s diversity? Big, sophisticated banks such as Chase and Wells Fargo understand climate science and know that our current path is leading towards climate catastrophe. Yet their machine of finance cranks along.\u201d Some activists have begun to envision a campaign to pressure the banks. Chase\u2019s retail business is a huge part of its enterprise, as is the case with Citi, Wells Fargo, and the others. \u201cOne of the major risk factors going forward for these guys is generational,\u201d Disterhoft said. \u201cYou have a rising generation of consumers and potential employees that cares a lot about climate, and they\u2019re going to be choosing who they do business with factoring that into account.\u201d In 2017, when Twitter-based activists accused Uber of exploiting Trump\u2019s anti-Muslim travel ban, rather than protesting it, it took just hours for downloads of the Lyft app to surge, for the first time, past those of the Uber app. Switching banks is harder, but, given the volume of credit-card solicitations that show up in the average mailbox every year, probably not much. A few of the big European banks have begun taking steps away from fossil fuels already. In June, the French giant Cr\u00e9dit Agricole announced a change that Disterhoft calls the \u201cgold standard to date\u201d: the bank said that it would no longer do business with companies that are expanding their coal operations, and that, by 2021, its coal-business clients in the developed world would have to produce a plan for getting out of the business by 2030; its clients in China by 2040; and its clients everywhere else by 2050. BankTrack, an N.G.O. headquartered in the Netherlands, called the announcement a \u201cwelcome first step,\u201d and, indeed, the restrictions have clearly begun to bite. In late June, an Indonesian power-company executive said, \u201cEuropean banks have said they don\u2019t want to finance coal projects for a while. Japanese followed and now Singapore. About eighty-five per cent of the market now don\u2019t want to finance coal-power plants.\u201d He added, \u201cCoal-power-plant financing is very challenging.\u201d According to the I.E.E.F.A.\u2019s Buckley, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole\u2019s move helps explain why, for instance, Vietnam, which was supposed to be a key market for new coal-fired power plants, instead grew its \u201csolar base tenfold in the twelve months to June, 2019.\u201d At this point, the coal business is already on its heels, so campaigners are increasingly focussed on gas and oil, but C.A.\u2019s move shows that big, quick shifts are possible. Asset Management\n\nEvery year, Larry Fink, the C.E.O. of BlackRock, writes a letter to the C.E.O.s of the companies in which his company invests. This year, his letter was about capitalism with a \u201cpurpose.\u201d Along with making a profit, he counselled, the C.E.O.s should be running their businesses to help \u201caddress pressing social and economic issues.\u201d Given that the rapid heating of the planet would seem to meet that criteria, some have suggested that Fink should look at his own operation; BlackRock is the world\u2019s largest investor in coal companies, coal-fired utilities, oil and gas companies, and companies driving deforestation. No one else is trying as diligently to make money off the destruction of the planet. And no one else has as powerful a remedy at hand. Most of the money that pension funds and endowments and individuals invest at BlackRock goes into passive funds, which track a stock-market index, rather than trying to beat the averages. BlackRock, in essence, just buys the market. If the firm simply decided to exclude fossil-fuel stocks from its main funds\u2014or if it even just decided to underweight the stocks\u2014it would send a message like no other. (According to the I.E.E.F.A., it would also produce better returns for its clients. A study that the group published in early August notes that BlackRock investors lost ninety billion dollars over the past decade by staying heavily invested in fossil fuels, even as that sector dramatically underperformed compared to the rest of the market.) The firm couldn\u2019t make this change overnight. Casey Harrell, a senior campaigner at the Australia-based Sunrise Project\u2014a nonprofit that co\u00f6rdinates a campaign called BlackRock\u2019s Big Problem, which aims to pressure the firm to change its investing strategy\u2014concedes that BlackRock simply holds too much stock: nine per cent of BP, seven per cent of Exxon. \u201cIf they had to sell it all at once, they\u2019d get a bad price, and that would open them to legal exposure. But five years is absolutely doable,\u201d Harrell told me. Tom Sanzillo, the finance director at the I.E.E.F.A., told me that he made just that suggestion at this year\u2019s BlackRock shareholders\u2019 meeting, in Manhattan. Sanzillo is not a rain-forest activist or a typical climate campaigner; he is a rumpled sixty-four-year-old veteran of the finance industry, who once served as the acting comptroller in charge of New York State\u2019s two-hundred-billion-dollar pension fund. Here\u2019s his account of what would happen if BlackRock decided to take an aggressive stand and announce that it would slowly start to exclude fossil-fuel stocks from the basket of equities in its biggest funds: \u201cThe stock market would react by driving oil- and gas-stock prices down for both private companies and those state-owned enterprises on the stock market to new lows\u2014institutional investors would understand that continued investment in the fossil-fuel sector meant more volatility, lower returns, and negative future outlook.\u201d The sell-off in fossil-fuel stocks would be only half the story, though, Sanzillo says. Money would instead pour into renewable energy, and, since solar and wind power will be increasingly cheaper than fossil fuels, that shift would, in turn, \u201cprompt substantial gains economy-wide, with manufacturing and other energy-intensive stock prices increasing.\u201d The public-finance desks at every major bank in the world would issue economic-outlook alerts for every country whose economy depends on producing fossil fuels. Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Venezuela, Australia, and Canada would risk seeing their bonds downgraded. But four-fifths of the world\u2019s population lives in nations that currently pay to import fossil fuels, and their economies would benefit, as ample financing would allow them to transition relatively quickly to low-cost solar and wind power. It wouldn\u2019t just be a market signal, Sanzillo said; it would be a \u201cglaring red rocket,\u201d a signal that the \u201cfossil-fuel industry has the wind in its face and been kicked in the ass.\u201d How large would that signal be? The assets under BlackRock\u2019s management are worth nearly seven trillion dollars, making it, by some measures, the third-largest economy on earth, after the United States and China, and ahead of Japan. If the damage to BlackRock\u2019s core business from fossil-fuel divestment would be manageable\u2014how many people are going to go out of their way to demand some climate destruction in their passive index funds, after all?\u2014why isn\u2019t the company already moving (and Vanguard and Fidelity and State Street with it)? BlackRock grew to its mammoth size in the years after the financial crisis, in part because it wasn\u2019t designated by the government as a \u201csystematically important financial institution,\u201d and so it was spared some of the regulation that big investment houses loathe. That, obviously, could change. And Harrell referred me to a 2017 report from 50/50 Climate, an N.G.O. now called Climate Majority, which noted that, as of 2015, BlackRock handled the pension and other welfare funds for BP, Exxon, and Chevron, earning millions of dollars in fees. \u201cYou can imagine the impact on that business if BlackRock started marketing fossil-free funds as the default option,\u201d he said. BlackRock\u2019s corporate-communications department would not confirm if the company handles those pension funds. But a spokesperson pointed out that customers, if they so choose, can already buy \u201cno-carbon, low-carbon, and energy-transition investments,\u201d which currently make up forty-four billion dollars, less than one per cent of BlackRock\u2019s business. Company representatives also offer a wonderfully circular defense: a spokesperson said that BlackRock holds investments only in funds that \u201cour clients choose to invest in.\u201d He added, \u201cOur obligation as an asset manager and a fiduciary is to manage our clients\u2019 assets consistent with their investment priorities.\u201d So the customers buy the product; BlackRock is just the middleman. Which is true, but there\u2019s no reason that BlackRock couldn\u2019t construct its own index, and market it in such a way as to make a fossil-free fund the default option for investors. It\u2019s as if the firm were saying, The buffet at our restaurant has always included arsenic. It\u2019s part of what makes it a buffet. But wouldn\u2019t it be a nicer restaurant if you actually had to go out of your way to order the arsenic? That\u2019s what Amundi, one of Europe\u2019s largest asset-management funds, has decided to do. Earlier this year, it committed to phasing out coal stocks from its passive index (along with investments in chemical and biological weapons and cluster bombs). As climate concerns grow, the pressure for American companies to do likewise, and to extend the ban to oil and gas, will also mount. In January, for instance, the Yes Men satire collective released a hoax version of Fink\u2019s annual letter to C.E.O.s, the day before the real one was due to be released. \u201cWithin 5 years, more than 90% of our 1000+ investment products will be converted to screen out non-Paris compliant companies such as coal, oil, and gas, which we see as declining and endangered,\u201d the fake letter said. What\u2019s interesting was how believable the idea was\u2014even the Financial Times tweeted out the \u201cnews.\u201d And why not? If you think about it for a moment\u2014just as a person, not as a cynical and knowing sophisticate\u2014why would anyone invest in companies that can\u2019t even meet the modest commitments we made at Paris?
