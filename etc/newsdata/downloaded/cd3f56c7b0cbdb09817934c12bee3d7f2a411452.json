Soon after Waller-Bridge\u2019s writing win, the show\u2019s director, Harry Bradbeer, was awarded a trophy of his own. After noting that \u201csomething like Fleabag only comes along once in your life,\u201d he expressed gratitude toward Waller-Bridge for trusting him with her vision: \u201cThank you for coming into my life like some kind of glorious grenade.\u201d\n\nWaller-Bridge and Fleabag managed to land two more surprising wins tonight. The auteur claimed the award for Outstanding Actress in a Comedy Series, beating out Julia Louis-Dreyfus, the much heralded star of Veep, and Rachel Brosnahan, of the Emmy favorite The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. Naturally, Waller-Bridge approached this win with the same irreverence that animates her series: \u201cI find acting really hard and really painful but it\u2019s all about this,\u201d Waller-Bridge said, jokingly echoing her earlier acceptance speech.\n\nBefore the end of the night, Fleabag won the biggest award it was nominated for: Outstanding Comedy Series, beating out heavyweights including The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, Barry, The Good Place, and Veep. \u201cThis is just getting ridiculous,\u201d Waller-Bridge quipped after taking the stage yet again, this time with her cast and crew. \u201cFleabag says thanks,\u201d she added.\n\nThe appeal of Waller-Bridge\u2019s work, whether Fleabag or Killing Eve, stems in large part from its subtle yet unflinching examination of women\u2019s interiority. Waller-Bridge\u2019s characters are complex, but they\u2019re not written as psychological case studies. Fleabag, despite her self-hatred, is still allowed to feel good, to experience moments of satisfaction and breakthrough amid her suffering. Waller-Bridge relished writing the show\u2019s small rebellions. \u201cThe thing I really got off on was putting a female character out there that was all-knowing about sex and one step ahead, who knew what the guys were thinking before they thought it and yet still played slightly dumb to them,\u201d Waller-Bridge told The Cut in 2017. \u201cOh God, it brought me so much pleasure.\u201d\n\nThe actor and writer has never seemed naive about the importance of her work in a television landscape that remains dominated by men. As she said early during the ceremony, \u201cIt\u2019s really wonderful to know a dirty, pervy, angry messed-up woman can make it to the Emmys.\u201d Whether she was talking about herself or Fleabag was for viewers to decide.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
