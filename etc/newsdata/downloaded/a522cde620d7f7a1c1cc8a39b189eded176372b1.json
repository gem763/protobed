Agricultural and other industrial goods will face even higher tariffs.\n\nU.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said the U.S. will impose the new tariffs on Oct. 18.\n\n\"For years, Europe has been providing massive subsidies to Airbus that have seriously injured the U.S. aerospace industry and our workers,\" Lighthizer said.\n\nOfficials released a list of new tariffs Wednesday after the WTO sided with the U.S. in finding the EU provided illegal subsidies to Airbus, giving it an unfair edge and costing Boeing sales as a result. Litigation in the case had been going on for close to 15 years. The annual reward of $7.5 billion in tariffs is the largest award in WTO history.\n\nThe EU has also accused the U.S. of providing subsidies to Boeing in violation of WTO rules.\n\nEuropean leaders have threatened to respond to U.S. tariffs with new tariffs of their own. In April, the EU released a list of $20 billion in U.S. products it may target with tariffs.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "U.S. airlines could feel the financial crunch from new tariffs on Airbus planes", "authors": ["James Leggate"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/06/0/0/delta-video-thumbnail.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
