China despite free speech row", "language": "en", "text": "Shanghai (AFP) \u2013 The NBA confirmed an annual exhibition game in China would go ahead on Thursday, rejecting calls to scrap the event over a free speech row that was ignited by an American basketball executive\u2019s pro-democracy tweet.\n\nSuperstar LeBron James is set to lead his Los Angeles Lakers against the Brooklyn Nets in Shanghai on Thursday night, the first of two pre-season matches held each year to build on the league\u2019s already huge popularity in China.\n\nAn intense Chinese backlash against the world\u2019s top basketball league \u2014 triggered by a Houston Rockets executive\u2019s tweet last week in support of Hong Kong\u2019s democracy movement \u2014 had thrown the games and the NBA\u2019s larger interests in China into doubt.\n\nIn an open letter, a bipartisan set of US lawmakers urged the NBA on Wednesday to suspend all activities in China until Chinese firms and broadcasters end their various boycotts of the league over the controversy.\n\nThe open letter urged NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, who came to Shanghai for Thursday\u2019s game, to \u201ctake a stand.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not unreasonable to expect American companies to put our fundamental democratic rights ahead of profit,\u201d said the letter.\n\nChina already had yanked away the welcome mat, with broadcasters cancelling plans to air the two pre-season games and Chinese NBA sponsors severing ties in protest.\n\nCrews on Wednesday also tore down giant promotional banners showing James and other evidence of the match throughout Shanghai, as Chinese netizens called for the games to be scrapped.\n\nHowever the NBA confirmed on Thursday afternoon the Shanghai game would go ahead.\n\n\u201cThe Lakers and the Nets will face each other in the NBA China game in Shanghai beginning tonight at 1930,\u201d the NBA said on its verified Chinese social media account.\n\nThe posts did not mention the second game of the series scheduled for the southern city of Shenzhen on Saturday.\n\nSilver and the NBA initially responded to Rockets general manager Daryl Morey\u2019s Friday tweet with statements that American politicians branded as kow-towing to China.\n\nRockets guard James Harden, in Japan for another exhibition game, also apologised to China even though he had not publicly expressed any views previously on the matter.\n\n\u2013 Anger over free speech vow \u2013\n\nThen, under mounting pressure in the United States, Silver on Tuesday made a strong defence of free speech and American values that provoked new outrage in China\u2019s state-controlled media.\n\n\u201cThe long-held values of the NBA are to support freedom of expression, and certainly freedom of expression by members of the NBA community,\u201d Silver said in Japan.\n\nHe added that the league would \u201chave to live with\u201d any consequences that may arise from that.\n\nHowever although Chinese netizens called for fans to shun the league, a broader protest campaign on China\u2019s government-controlled internet is yet to take root.\n\nAnd there has been no suggestion yet that popular broadcasts in China of the NBA\u2019s upcoming regular season are in jeopardy.\n\nAfter a video of fans waiting for players at their Shanghai hotel was posted to leading social media platform Weibo, a related hashtag quickly became one of the country\u2019s most viewed on Thursday.\n\nResponses were overwhelmingly critical of the NBA and its loyal Chinese fans, but many others called for cooler heads.\n\n\u201cJames and many players are always good idols but the NBA needs to be responsible for what they said and did,\u201d one post said.\n\nHong Kong has endured nearly four months of protests ignited by a now-scrapped plan to allow extraditions of criminal suspects to be tried in China\u2019s opaque courts.\n\nThey snowballed into a movement calling for more democratic freedoms, the biggest challenge to China\u2019s rule of Hong Kong since its handover from the British in 1997.\n\nChina reacts fiercely to any questioning of its sovereignty over semi-autonomous Hong Kong, and state media has repeatedly warned foreign firms that voicing support for protesters could cost them access to China\u2019s market of 1.4 billion people.\n\nThe People\u2019s Daily, mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party, on Wednesday slammed a transport app available on Apple\u2019s store that it alleged helped protesters identify police in Hong Kong.\n\nApple responded quickly to the criticism, dropping the app on Thursday.\n\nUS jewellery brand Tiffany and Hong Kong\u2019s flagship airline, Cathay Pacific, have also been heavily criticised in China.",
