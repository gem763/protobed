Sign up here.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s reelection campaign wasted no time trying to raise money off the killing of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\n\nIn a text to supporters just hours after Trump announced the successful U.S. special forces raid in northwest Syria, the campaign blasted out a quick poll on the president\u2019s job performance.\n\nThe link leads supporters to an \u201cOfficial Job Performance Poll\u201d with three choices to rate the president: Great, Good, or Okay.\n\nAfter respondents submit an answer along with their name, email address, and ZIP code, they reach another page, with a picture of a stern-looking Trump \u2014 his finger pointing at the camera like Uncle Sam \u2014 and an appeal to \u201ctake the next step\u201d by ponying up some cash.\n\n\u201cOur President has accomplished more for our Nation than any other President in the history of the United States,\u201d the page reads. \u201cUnder his fierce leadership, ISIS is being ELIMINATED. If President Trump isn\u2019t re-elected, Democrats will deplete our great military and weaken our national security.\u201d\n\nREAD: Trump says ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi blew himself up 'whimpering' and 'crying'\n\nFaux polls are one of the most common ways the reelection effort gathers contact information across digital media, with arbitrary deadlines suggesting a sense of urgency for replies. The Trump campaign has pumped out about 41,000 Facebook ads pushing similar surveys, according to the tech company\u2019s Ad Library, including a Mainstream Media Accountability Survey and an Official Election Victory Survey.\n\nThe Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee raised $125 million last quarter, thanks in large part to small donors reached through such aggressive digital marketing. The reelection effort has thrown unprecedented sums of money at Facebook and Google. It\u2019s helped them get a huge head start on potential Democratic opponents in amassing voters\u2019 personal data.\n\n\u201cThis effectively lets us understand where every single voter is in America \u2014 who they are and what they\u2019re going to do,\u201d Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said on the campaign\u2019s official podcast in August. \u201cAnd one of the big things we\u2019re going to do with that data is get them connected.\u201d\n\nCover: U.S. President Donald Trump makes a statement in the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House October 27, 2019 in Washington, DC.
