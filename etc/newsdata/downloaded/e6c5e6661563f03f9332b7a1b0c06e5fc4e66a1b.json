What will people think?'\n\nThe truth is that Stanley and Sheila Dwight should never have got married. They just didn't get on. They were both stubborn and short-tempered, two delightful characteristics that it's been my huge good fortune to inherit.\n\nThe rows at home were endless. At least they subsided when my dad, who was in the RAF, was posted abroad. If I was marginally less terrified of him than I was of my mother, it was only because he wasn't around as much.\n\nTension: Sheila with Elton as a toddler\n\nWhen she was happy, Mum could be warm and charming and vivacious, but she always seemed to be looking for a reason not to be happy, always seemed to be in search of a fight.\n\nUncle Reg famously said she could start an argument in an empty room.\n\nMe: Elton John Official Autobiography by Elton John is published by Macmillan on October 15, \u00a325\n\nShe thought there was nothing wrong with children that couldn't be cured by thumping the living daylights out of them \u2014 petrifying and humiliating when it happened in public.\n\nThere's nothing like getting a hiding outside Pinner Sainsbury's, in front of several visibly intrigued onlookers, for playing havoc with your self-esteem.\n\nAnd, years later, I found out that when I was two, she'd toilet-trained me by hitting me with a wire brush until I bled if I didn't use the potty.\n\nI loved her \u2014 she was my mum \u2014 but I spent my childhood in a state of high alert, always trying to ensure I never did anything that might set her off. So I was incredibly insecure, scared of my own shadow.\n\nSir Elton and his mother Sheila in 2003\n\nOn top of that, I thought I was somehow responsible for the state of my parents' marriage because a lot of their rows were about how I was being brought up. It didn't make me feel very good about myself, which manifested in a lack of confidence in my appearance.\n\nFor years, I couldn't bear to look at myself in the mirror. I really hated what I saw: I was too fat, too short, my face just looked weird, my hair would never do what I wanted it to, including not prematurely falling out.\n\nThe other lasting effect was a fear of confrontation. That went on for decades. I stayed in bad personal and business relationships because I didn't want to rock the boat.\n\nMy response, when things got too much, was always to run upstairs and lock the door, which is exactly what I did when my parents fought.\n\nDon't go breaking my heart: Elton and his mother, Sheila\n\nMe: Elton John Official Autobiography by Elton John is published by Macmillan on October 15, \u00a325. \u00a9 Elton John 2019.\n\nTo order a copy for \u00a312.50 (50 per cent discount) call 01603 648155 or go to mailshop.co.uk\n\nFREE delivery on all orders.
