He denies wrongdoing.\n\nSaikawa blamed what he called \u201cthe Ghosn system\u201d at Nissan for the payments, and said the system was being reviewed.\n\nSaikawa succeeded Ghosn and in the past was closely allied with Ghosn, who led Nissan for two decades and made it one of the most successful automakers in the world.\n\nSaikawa said he had left the task of overseeing the compensation system to Greg Kelly, a former board director who was arrested last year with Ghosn on financial misconduct allegations. Kelly has maintained he is innocent.\n\nSince the arrests of Ghosn and Kelly, Nissan profits and sales have tumbled. Investors are also worried about Nissan\u2019s relationship with alliance partner Renault SA RNO, +2.42% of France, which owns 43% of Nissan. Ghosn was sent in by Renault to lead Nissan, and in the years before his arrest had led both Renault and Nissan.", "description": "The chief executive of scandal-plagued Nissan on Thursday acknowledged receiving inappropriate payments from the Japanese automaker but denied he ordered it...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ720_nissan_ZG_20190904235918.jpg"}
