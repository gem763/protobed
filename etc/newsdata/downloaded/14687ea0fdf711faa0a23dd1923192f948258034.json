You can\u2019t explain it,\u201d Washington manager Dave Martinez said.\n\nAdam Eaton and Soto hit solo homers off Justin Verlander in the fifth to help the Nationals rally. Anthony Rendon also went deep and drove in five runs.\n\nMax Scherzer, revitalized by an injection of painkiller, is primed to return from an irritated nerve in his neck to start Game 7 for Washington in a Series that has been all road, sweet, road.\n\n\u201cMaybe they enjoy our park and maybe we enjoy their park. We\u2019re not going to ask questions. We\u2019re just going to try to go out there and just have some fun,\u201d Rendon said.\n\n\u201cAnytime we get Max on the mound for us, we like our chances.\u201d\n\nZack Greinke will start for the Astros, who led the majors with 107 wins and are seeking their second title in three seasons.\n\n\u201cI wish it was in a National League park,\u201d Greinke joked, cracking a smile.\n\nScherzer was warming up in the seventh before Rendon\u2019s homer, then sat down as Martinez became the first manager tossed from a Series game since Atlanta\u2019s Bobby Cox in 1996.\n\n\u201cWhen I couldn\u2019t even move my right arm the other day, and I was in severe pain, I just believed in next guy up,\u201d Scherzer said.\n\n\u201cEverybody has the belief in me and the doctors that I could get right and be ready for Game 7.\u201d\n\nFired up after a disputed call at first base went against them in the seventh, the Nationals padded their lead moments later when Rendon homered off Will Harris. Martinez, still enraged at umpires, was ejected during the seventh-inning stretch, screaming as a pair of his coaches held him back while the crowd sang along to \u201cDeep in the Heart of Texas.\u201d\n\nRendon added a two-run double off Chris Devenski in the ninth to just about seal it after Strasburg gutted through without his best fastball to throw five-hit ball for 8 1/3 innings. Washington pitching coach Paul Menhart told Strasburg after the first inning that he was tipping pitches. Strasburg allowed only three more hits.\n\n\u201cStarted shaking my glove, so they didn\u2019t know what I was throwing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that has burned me in the past, and it burned me there in the first.\u201d\n\nNow the Nationals will attempt their ultimate comeback in a year in which they were written off time after time, hoping for the first title in the 51-season history of a franchise that started as the Montreal Expos and the first for Washington since the Senators in 1924.\n\nVisiting teams have won three straight Game 7s in the Series since the Cardinals defeated Texas at home in 2011.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a person in the building that would have assumed that all road teams were going to win,\u201d Houston manager AJ Hinch said. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to make sure that last one is not the same.\u201d\n\nWashington rebounded from a 19-31 start \u2014 the Nats were given just a 1.6% chance to win the Series on May 23 \u2014 to finish 93-69. They rebounded from a 3-1 eighth-inning deficit against Milwaukee in the NL wild-card game, a two-games-to-one deficit vs. the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Division Series and a 2-1, fifth-inning deficit in Game 6 vs. the Astros.\n\nOutscored 19-3 at Nationals Park while going 1 for 21 with runners in scoring position, the Nationals got the strong outing they needed from Strasburg, who allowed his only runs in the first inning, struck out seven and walked two while throwing 104 pitches.\n\n\u201cIt was a mental grind out there, especially after the first,\u201d Strasburg said. \u201cJust got to keep fighting.\u201d\n\nStrasburg was memorably shut down by the Nationals in September 2012 to protect his arm in his first full season following Tommy John surgery, and Washington was beaten by St. Louis in the Division Series.\n\nHe improved to 5-0 with a 1.98 ERA in six postseason starts this October despite failing to get a swing and miss in the first two innings for the first time this year. Eight of nine swings and misses overall were on breaking balls. Strasburg escaped a two-on, two-out jam in the fourth by striking out Carlos Correa.\n\nAfter George Springer\u2019s one-out double put runners at second and third in the fifth, Jos\u00e9 Altuve struck out on curve in the dirt and Michael Brantley hit a hard grounder to second.\n\n\u201cStras is doing Stras things out there,\u201d Rendon said. \u201cIt\u2019s been amazing.\u201d\n\nSean Doolittle got the final two outs as the Nationals bullpen headed into Game 7 relatively rested. He gave up a two-out double to Correa before retiring Robinson Chirinos on a popup.\n\nVerlander dropped to 0-6 with a 5.68 ERA in seven Series starts, a blemish on his otherwise sterling career.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really have great feel for the off-speed stuff,\u201d Verlander said. \u201cThe last inning just a poorly executed slider and then really just kind of a fastball up and in.\u201d\n\nMartinez\u2019s ejection came after Trea Turner was called out for interference when he ran on the fair side of the foul line and knocked the glove off first base Yuli Gurriel in the seventh following his slow roller. Washington was leading 3-2 at the time and would have had runners on second and third with no outs.\n\nJoe Torre, MLB\u2019s chief baseball officer, said the long delay that followed was caused by umpires at Minute Maid Park consulting with the replay room in New York to confirm the decision on the field was not subject to review.\n\nIn the first game with lead changes since the opener, Rendon\u2019s RBI single through a shifted infield put the Astros ahead in the first. Verlander gave up 10 runs in the first inning during six postseason starts this year after allowing 12 during 34 regular-season outings,\n\nHouston needed just four pitches to tie the score. Springer lined a fastball off the left-field scoreboard, at 112 mph off the bat the hardest-hit ball of the Series. He advanced on a wild pitch and scored on Altuve\u2019s sacrifice fly to left, easily beating Soto\u2019s throw.\n\nBregman put the Astros ahead on Strasburg\u2019s 12th pitch, driving a fastball into the Crawford Boxes over the left-field scoreboard for his fourth home run of the postseason and third of the Series. Bregman carried his bat out of the batter\u2019s box and tried to hand it to first base coach Don Kelly, only for the bat to fall as Kelly stuck out his hand for a shake.\n\nStrasburg called Bregman\u2019s antics \u201ctired.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just let my emotions get the best of me and it\u2019s not how I was raised to play the game,\u201d Bregman said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for doing that.\u201d\n\nEaton tied the score in the fifth when Verlander hung a slider. Soto, who homered at age 20 in the opener, followed one out later with his second long ball after turning 21. He lined a high-and-inside fastball into the right-field upper deck, a no-doubt drive Verlander didn\u2019t bother to watch.\n\nSoto, too, flipped the bat at his first base coach, Tim Bogar.\n\n\u201cI just thought it was pretty cool,\u201d Soto said when asked if he was mimicking Bregman. \u201cI wanted to do it.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB coverage: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 It's been an unconventional road to Game 7 of the World Series for Stephen Strasburg and the Washington Nationals.
