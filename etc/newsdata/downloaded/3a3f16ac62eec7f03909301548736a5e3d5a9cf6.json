That is such a tough question! I would want to do both. I'm greedy, they're both once in a lifetime opportunities.\n\n'I was lucky enough to have that opportunity in 2011 with the World Cup in New Zealand.\n\n'We didn't quite have what it takes to win a World Cup but now I have a new opportunity with X Factor and my rugby brothers and hopefully we can do a little bit better than we did in the World Cup and go onto win!'\n\nThe X Factor: Celebrity goes live on ITV at 8.20pm on Saturday night.", "description": "X Factor: Celebrity star Ben Foden has revealed he's planning two wedding parties with wife Jackie to celebrate their vows and they will be moving home from New York to the UK next summer.", "authors": ["Sarah Packer For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/11/20175636-0-image-a-50_1571999834633.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
