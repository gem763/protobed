Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT).\n\nEven the Associated Press (AP) called out Sanders for his dramatic description of so-called manmade climate change, asking Princeton University climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer about the debate claim.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re forgetting about the existential threat of climate change,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cRight now the CEOs in the fossil fuel industry know full-well that their product is destroying this world and they continue to make huge profits.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go to the most important international problem that we\u2019re facing, which no one has brought up, which is climate,\u201d billionaire Tom Steyer said during the debate. \u201cWe can\u2019t solve the climate crisis in the United States by ourselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an international crisis,\u201d Steyer said. \u201cI\u2019ve been working on it for ten years, taking on the corporations. But we have to work with our allies and our frenemies around the world.\u201d\n\nThe AP reported specifically on the accuracy of Sanders remarks:\n\nTHE FACTS: Earth\u2019s existence and life on the planet will not end because of climate change, as the Vermont senator asserts. Fossil fuels do not have Earth on a path of destruction. Science says climate change is dramatic and will cause harm, but it won\u2019t wipe out everything and won\u2019t end humanity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an existential threat for many species. It\u2019s an existential threat for many ecosystems. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an existential threat for humanity,\u201d Princeton University climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer said in the AP report:\n\nThe Earth will still exist and so will humans, but the way we live and the planet will be dramatically different if burning of fossil fuels continues unabated, said Oppenheimer, a co-author of many of the most dire international science reports on climate change.\n\nAP notes that the word \u201cexistential\u201d has lost its impact from politicians using it to describe things where existence is not at stake.\n\n\u201cIn the debate, for example, Sen. Cory Booker described the closing of two Planned Parenthood clinics in Ohio as an existential threat to abortion rights in America,\u201d AP reported.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter.", "description": "Climate change was not mentioned much at Tuesday's Democrat debate, and what was said was challenged in an Associated Press report.", "authors": ["Penny Starr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1181333168-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
