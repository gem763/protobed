Some of the improvements in third-quarter auto gross margins were largely around warranty accounting and a renegotiated agreement with Panasonic Corp. 6752, -0.64%, which makes Tesla\u2019s battery cells, rather than operational improvements, the analysts said.\n\nThe trajectory of the stock this week seems to bear some of that questioning: The shares were on pace for their third straight loss, down 5% in the past three sessions.\n\nThey were holding well above $300, a place they hadn\u2019t been since late February, catapulted to that mark by gains of nearly 18% on Thursday, a day after the quarterly results, and of more than 9% on Friday.\n\nSee also: Tesla bull praises \u2018Picasso-like\u2019 quarter, but others question whether profit can be sustained\n\nOn Tuesday, analysts at Roth also cast doubt on the quality of Tesla\u2019s third-quarter beat and zeroed in on the warranty adjustments and other one-time items as the drivers of the surprise quarterly profit.\n\nThe Roth analysts knocked down their ratings on Tesla shares to sell, from their equivalent of hold, and said they remained cautious on the stock as they expect delivery growth to slow down in 2020.\n\nRelated: GM stock soars as investors look past \u2018messy\u2019 outlook\n\nTesla shares have lost more than 6% this year, contrasting with gains of 21% and 16% for the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.33% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
