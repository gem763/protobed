It was soon translated into 13 languages, according to his website.\n\nIn 1965, he undertook research in urban sociology and his experiences provided material for his next novel, \u201cThe City Builder\u201d.\n\nIn an interview for Die Zeit in 1974, Konrad said: \u201cI write what I write; the state publishing houses in Hungary publish of my work what they will, while I publish as much of it as I can.\u201d\n\nIn the last decades of communism until the collapse of the regime in 1989 Konrad was a forbidden author in Hungary.\n\nHe was one of the key voices in the democratic opposition, with his works published in samizdat journals, in clandestine distribution of literature banned by the state.\n\nFrom 1989 onwards, Konrad was one of the thinkers who paved the way for the transition to democracy in Hungary.\n\nHe was an outspoken critic of right-wing Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has been in power since 2010, for what he said was an erosion of democratic values.\n\n\u201cMy homeland is beginning to resemble the post-Soviet dictatorships of Central Asia; some are even calling it Orbanistan. A number of young Hungarians are planning to leave, many for Western Europe,\u201d Konrad wrote in a piece in the New York Times in 2012.\n\nFrom 1997 to 2003, Konrad was elected President of Berlin\u2019s Akademie der K\u00fcnste for two terms and in this role he contributed to the intellectual rapprochement between the East and West of Europe and helped introduce writers and other creative figures from Central Europe to the West.\n\nHis book \u201cA guest in my own country: A Hungarian life\u201d won the National Jewish Book Award in the category of memoir and autobiography. It traced his life as a Hungarian child during the Holocaust and later as a student during the 1956 revolution against Soviet rule.\n\nKonrad was President of the International P.E.N. Club in the early 1990s. He also received the Herder Prize, the Charles Veillon Prize, and the Goethe Medal among others.", "description": "Internationally acclaimed Hungarian writer Gyorgy Konrad, a leading figure in the dissident movement under communist rule, died on Friday at the age of 86 after a long illness, state news ageny MTI reported, citing his family.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
