Trump is not willing to give up his maximum pressure on Iran before he gets a meeting, and Rouhani is not willing to meet before the pressure is lifted. And the new talk of Trump\u2019s impeachment in Congress will now further reduce the possibility of direct talks between Tehran and Washington.\n\nThe American and Iranian presidents see a bilateral meeting from completely opposite perspectives.\n\nTrump, a longtime businessman, sees a face-to-face meeting as the starting point. It\u2019s a way for him to build a relationship and then move forward to make deals. Rouhani, a longtime statesman, sees a one-on-one meeting as the ending point. He wants to get something concrete, before he shakes hands in front of cameras.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Ms Slavin believes the French President Emmanuel Macron has made \u201cheroic efforts\u201d but neither he, the Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan or anyone else can overcome Iran\u2019s basic demand.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Then he extended an olive branch saying the United States does not believe in forever enemies, signalling that he wants to build a relationship with Iranian leaders and things could change if they meet with him.\n\nRouhani did the same at the podium the next day. He first accused the United States of stoking conflict in the Middle East and hurting Iranian women and children with \u201ceconomic terrorism\u201d. He then suggested that Iranians want peace, explaining that negotiations with the US can restart once the White House lifts sanctions and eases the pressure on Tehran.\n\nRouhani even acknowledged Trump\u2019s disdain for the nuclear deal as Barack Obama\u2019s legacy, saying \u201cIf you are sensitive to the name of the JCPOA, you can return to its framework\u201d and lift sanctions.\n\nPouya Alimagham, professor of Middle Eastern history at MIT, thinks Rouhani and his foreign minister Javad Zarif have risked their entire political careers on this nuclear agreement. He says the Iranian electorate voted for Rouhani in 2013 on the promise with engagement with the world, and again in 2017 on the promise that they will enjoy the economic relief promised under the 2015 nuclear agreement.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

With President Trump subverting the agreement, the conservatives feel vindicated, and Rouhani and Zarif have been undermined.\u201d\n\nHe added that for Rouhani to now reward Trump by giving him what he wants, a photo-op, without the promise of anything tangible in return, is for them to further undermine themselves.\n\nTrump wants a strong foreign policy victory ahead of the 2020 election. But the Iranians have every reason to distrust him and do not want to give him a victory without anything in return.\n\nMr Alimagham says \u201cconfidence-building measures, especially with the power that holds almost all the leverage, is necessary. The US can reinstate the waivers so that Iran can sell some of its oil and not obstruct the French offer of $15 billion credit line.\u201d Since Trump was the once who scrapped the nuclear deal and imposed unilateral, crippling sanctions on Iran, the goodwill should also begin with him.\n\nIn the middle of the US-Iran standoff are European powers - Britain, France and Germany - who are trying to de-escalate tensions and bring the two sides together. President Macron tried to convince the Iranian president that it will be a \u201clost opportunity\u201d if he leaves New York without meeting Trump because he will not come back to New York in a few months and Trump will not go to Tehran. Boris Johnson also tried to convince Rouhani to meet Trump while they are both at the UN, telling him: \u201cYou need to be on the side of the swimming pool and jump at the same time.\u201d\n\nWilliam Luers, a former US ambassador and president of the United Nations Association of the USA, thinks the standoff is on a perilous course and sanctions relief remains the obstacle to de-escalation. He told The Independent that the US will not reduce sanctions and Iran will not move forward without some easing, so the two sides could bypass this stonewall by making a gesture to\n\nMr Luers said: \u201cZarif continues to have authority to do this and President Trump takes pride in his ability to have freed American prisoners.\u201d Such negotiations could open a \u201cnew much needed channel\u201d he added.\n\nThere is not much hope for a breakthrough between Tehran and Washington while the two presidents are in New York. But continued European mediation could help break the ice and eventually open the door for more sustainable diplomacy. Iran and the US seem to be far away in their positions. But neither side wants to end up in a war with the other, and that can be a good starting point.", "description": "There is no chance of a meeting between Donald Trump and Hassan Rouhani at the United Nations this week in New York.
