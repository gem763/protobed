That\u2019s a topic Republicans are particularly sensitive about just now.\n\nChair Ellen Weintraub appeared to keep her humor about it all, tweeting: \u201cFunny story,\u201d before explaining what went down.\n\nShe revealed in a series of messages that she had decided to print a \u201cDraft Interpretive Rule Concerning Prohibited Activities Involving Foreign Nationals\u201d on the FEC website. The draft is supposed to be discussed at an upcoming FEC meeting just as President Donald Trump faces an impeachment inquiry for pushing Ukraine\u2019s president to launch an investigation into his political rival Joe Biden.\n\nThen, GOP FEC Commissioner Caroline Hunter \u201ctook the altogether unprecedented step of objecting\u201d to Weintraub\u2019s draft being added to the FEC\u2019s regular weekly digest and blocked the entire digest. So Weintraub printed the whole thing \u2014 on Twitter.\n\nThen a bit of a zinger from Weintraub: \u201cI always thought these anti-regulatory people liked the First Amendment well enough. I guess they think it\u2019s just for corporations. I\u2019m not fond of anyone trying to suppress my speech.\u201d\n\n1/\n\n\n\nFunny story. The @FEC puts out a \"Weekly Digest\" of everything we do, an immensely helpful public resource.

So! Because Commissioner Hunter has blocked the Commission from publishing the FEC's Weekly Digest, I have decided to publish the information myself here on Twitter.\n\n\n\nHere it is: \u2014 Ellen L Weintraub (@EllenLWeintraub) September 27, 2019\n\nThe 39 tweets include everything from calendar changes to several civil penalties against people and groups who violated election law. It\u2019s all available on Weintraub\u2019s Twitter or here.\n\nThe draft on illegal foreign activities in an American election can be found here\ufeff and below:\n\nHere is the Chair of the FEC explaining why DOJ was wrong to conclude so swiftly that Trump\u2019s solicitation of Ukraine\u2019s help in his campaign is not a campaign finance crime. https://t.co/P8jA1b7sts \u2014 Mimi Rocah (@Mimirocah1) September 27, 2019\n\nThe FEC has been hamstrung since August, when Vice Chairman Matthew Petersen resigned, leaving the federal election watchdog without a quorum.
