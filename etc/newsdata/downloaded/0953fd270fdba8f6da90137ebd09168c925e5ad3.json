MORE (I-Vt.).\n\nMost Democratic senators are staying neutral in a presidential race that includes six sitting senators along with Biden, who served for decades in the Senate before becoming former President Obama\u2019s vice president.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMany don\u2019t want to take sides in a battle that is pitting colleagues against one another, and senators obviously don\u2019t want to create bad blood with any contenders \u2014 who will either return to the Senate or end up at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.\n\nYet a number of Democrats privately acknowledge that if Warren or Sanders wins the nomination, it will create immediate tension within the party.\n\nThe two progressives are to the left of many of their colleagues, and some of their best-known proposals, such as \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and free college education, do not have widespread support within the Democratic caucus.\n\nIf Warren or Sanders wins the party\u2019s presidential nomination, there will be pressure in the Senate to adopt their proposals. And there could be tensions between a nominee and senators who do not back their proposals.\n\nAnother factor is the race for the Senate. Some Democrats think it will be easier to win races in conservative-leaning states such as Alabama, North Carolina and Georgia if Biden is their nominee and not Warren or Sanders.\n\nOne Democratic senator who requested anonymity to discuss the race said a number of senators neutral in the race are more aligned with Biden.\n\n\u201cIdeologically, they\u2019re definitely more with Biden,\u201d said the Democratic senator, who described colleagues as having doubts about Warren\u2019s and Sanders\u2019s boldest proposals.\n\n\u201cMedicare for All, the Green New Deal, the wealth tax \u2014 the list is long,\u201d the senator said.\n\nA second Democratic senator who requested anonymity predicted that if Warren or Sanders is elected president, they will likely face opposition from fellow Democrats to some of their biggest proposals.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe senators have a great confidence in their own ability with a friendly White House to say, \u2018We like a lot of that, but we don\u2019t like all of it,\u2019 \u201d the senator said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to just do what they ask because they ask.\u201d\n\nThe support for Biden is clear just from the list of senators who have endorsed candidates in the race.\n\nFive Democratic senators are publicly backing Biden, while no other candidate has more than a single endorsement from a senator.\n\nSupporters of Biden aren\u2019t afraid to bolster the suggestion that the Senate Democratic Conference is more in tune with Biden than Sanders or Warren. In fact, they are seeking to use it to their advantage.\n\n\u201cMost currently serving senators are attracted to the pragmatic, progressive vision that Joe Biden has laid out,\u201d said Sen. Christopher Coons Christopher (Chris) Andrew CoonsBill to return B in unredeemed bonds advances Grassley: Kavanaugh classmate didn't contact Senate panel Democratic senator: Attacks on Saudi oil refineries 'may call for military action against Iran' MORE (D-Del.), who represents Biden\u2019s home state and has endorsed the longtime Delaware senator.\n\nCoons makes the electability argument for Biden in both the White House and the Senate.\n\n\u201cI think having Joe Biden as our nominee will not only make it more likely that we will defeat Trump in 2020 but also make it more likely that we will have a Democratic majority in the Senate,\u201d he said, adding that he\u2019s heard the same arguments from fellow Democratic senators.\n\nSen. Doug Jones (Ala.), the most vulnerable Senate Democratic incumbent up for reelection next year, says he endorsed Biden in large part because he thinks it will help him in next year\u2019s election.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s more reflective of not only folks here but also Democrats across the country,\u201d Jones said.\n\nAsked about the impact on his race if Warren or Sanders won the Democratic nomination, Jones said: \u201cClearly, they would not play as well in Alabama.\u201d\n\nAs the race has boiled down to the three front-runners, ideological differences have become more prominent. Biden sought to play up those differences at the last Democratic debate by touting himself as a champion of ObamaCare and drawing a contrast with Warren\u2019s and Sanders\u2019s support for Medicare for All.\n\nAsked Tuesday which of the front-runners best reflects the ideological views of the Democratic caucus, Sen. Jon Tester Jonathan (Jon) TesterGOP Sen. Johnny Isakson to resign at end of year Native American advocates question 2020 Democrats' commitment House Democrats targeting six more Trump districts for 2020 MORE (D-Mont.), who is neutral in the race, said, \u201cprobably Biden.\u201d\n\nSen.

And if you ask me to weigh America, I actually think America is a pretty centrist country,\u201d said Feinstein.\n\nOther Democrats such as Sen. Chris Murphy Christopher (Chris) Scott MurphyKavanaugh impeachment push hits Capitol buzz saw Democrats seize Senate floor to protest gun inaction: 'Put up or shut up' Senate Democrats to hold the floor to protest inaction on gun violence MORE (Conn.), who is neutral in the race, say the ideological differences between Biden, Warren and Sanders are getting overhyped.\n\n\u201cI think we way over-obsess about ideology in the primaries when most voters are voting based on personality, authenticity and style,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cWhen we have a conversation about electability, I think we have to admit that most voters are looking at the kind of person you are and whether they\u2019re seeing the real individual on the campaign trail.\u201d", "description": "There\u2019s a growing sense among members of the Senate Democratic Conference that life would be easier if Joe Biden wins the party\u2019s presidential nomination instead of his two closest competitors, Sens.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/bidenjoe_091219upi_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
