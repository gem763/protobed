The U.S.-led coalition said an investigation is underway, adding that no coalition forces or assets were hit.\n\nSo far, at least nine people have been reported killed and hundreds have been wounded since the violence and clashes between security forces and anti-government demonstrators first erupted on Tuesday.\n\nThe curfew was announced early Thursday following a meeting of Iraq\u2019s top leaders to discuss anti-government protests that have engulfed the country.\n\nAuthorities say the curfew is meant to \u201cprotect general peace\u201d and protect protesters from \u201cinfiltrators\u201d who committed attacks against security forces and public property. It excludes travelers to and from the Baghdad airport.\n\nBaghdad streets were largely deserted Thursday morning. In central Tahrir Square, hundreds of young protesters were gathered, and police fired tear gas canisters every now and then.\n\n\u201cWhether there is curfew or not we are going to continue,\u201d shouted one protester in Tahrir Square.\n\nWhen the demonstrators tried to reach a nearby bridge that leads to the Green Zone Thursday morning, Iraqi security forces opened fire from automatic rifles as well as tear gas, according to an Associated Press cameraman at the scene.\n\nThe U.S.-led coalition, which has a presence on the ground in Iraq, issued a statement saying it is monitoring the protests and added that \u201cwe call on all sides to reduce tensions and reject violence\u201d as the loss of life and injuries among civilians and Iraqi security forces was deeply concerning.\n\nCoalition spokesman Col. Myles B. Caggins III, said that explosions were heard in the Green Zone before dawn Thursday. He said Iraqi forces were investigating and that no coalition facility was struck. \u201cCoalition troops always reserve the right to defend ourselves, attacks on our personnel will not be tolerated,\u201d he said.\n\nAn Iraqi security official said two mortar shells hit the Green Zone, falling on open space and not causing any casualties. The official spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.\n\nThe protests, that have been concentrated in Baghdad and predominantly Shiite provinces in the country\u2019s south, appear to be spontaneous and without political leadership, organized by people on social media against corruption and lack of basic services, such as electricity and water.\n\nDozens of university graduates unable to find jobs in the corruption-plagued but oil-rich country also joined the rallies. Politicians denounced the violence and at least one, influential Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, called for an investigation.\n\nOn Wednesday, at least seven people were killed and dozens were wounded in clashes that spread across Iraq despite a massive security dragnet mounted by the government in an effort to quash the economically-driven protests. On Tuesday, protests had left two dead \u2014 one in Baghdad and another in the city of Nasiriyah \u2014 and over 200 wounded.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Baghdad residents said the Internet was still cut in much of the country. NetBlocks, which monitors cybersecurity and internet governance, reported that Internet access was cut off across much of Iraq and social and messaging apps blocked amid the growing unrest.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Bassem Mroue in Beirut contributed to this report.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
