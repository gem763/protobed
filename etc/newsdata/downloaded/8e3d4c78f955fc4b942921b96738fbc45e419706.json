The accounts also spent $77,000 in advertising to help promote posts with the first advert running in April 2018 and the most recent running in October this year.\n\nSEE: A winning strategy for cybersecurity (ZDNet special report) | Download the report as a PDF (TechRepublic)\n\nAnother campaign focused entirely on Sudan and has removed 17 accounts 18 pages, three groups and six Instagram accounts running it that originated in Russia.\n\nThis campaign used a combination of fake accounts, compromised accounts and local users to to comment, post and manage pages posing as news publications.\n\nAbout 457,000 users followed these accounts, which posted about local news in Sudan as well as global news, especially about Russia.\n\nFacebook has also removed a Russian-run network of 14 Facebook accounts, 12 pages, one group and one Instagram account which focused on Libya.
