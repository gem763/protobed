All he wants is a good to firm track.

If he handles it, I am sure he will be competitive, if not we will bring him back here [to Sha Tin], there is a nice mile race in early November.\n\n\u201cHe did a suspensory which put us off for a few months, he is an old horse but I still think he has something to give, maybe a little change of scenery might be enough to spark a bit of interest.\u201d\n\nFownes will saddle up horses in seven of the nine races on the night as he looks to build on his winning total of six this season.\n\nIronically, Joyful Trinity will face another John Moore French import in Helene Charisma, who is enjoying a purple patch of form.\n\nFormerly a Group One winner in France, Helene Charisma took 28 starts in Hong Kong to break his maiden status before going on to reel off three wins in seven starts, all at Happy Valley.\n\nAfter bottoming out at a rating of 74, Helene Charisma is now rated 96 and will be forced to carry the top weight of 133 pounds in the race.\n\nJockey Zac Purton will also jump aboard Benno Yung Tin-pang\u2019s Not Usual Talent for the first time as the progressive type looks to land his biggest win yet.\n\nThe five-year-old enjoyed a dream debut season in Hong Kong last term, winning three of his last six starts.\n\nTable-topping trainer Danny Shum Chap-shing will bring his Derby hopeful Playa Del Puente back to the city track as he looks to gain the much-needed ratings points to ensure a run in the four-year-old series features later this season.", "description": "Caspar Fownes did the seemingly impossible on Sunday afternoon in defeating Hong Kong\u2019s champion Beauty Generation, but he faces an arguably tougher task on Wednesday night \u2013 getting Joyful Trinity to win....", "authors": ["Trenton Akers", "Tom Biddington", "Sam Agars"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/21/5852eaba-f39e-11e9-87ad-fce8e65242a6_image_hires_135555.JPG?itok=-8y5K9KV&v=1571637363", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
