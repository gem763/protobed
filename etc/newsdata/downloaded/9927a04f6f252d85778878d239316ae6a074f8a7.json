He died in a hospital about 15 hours later.\n\nAbout a year before his death, Markel had finalized a divorce from Wendi Adelson, who was also a professor at FSU and director of a law clinic that assisted medical patients facing disability and immigration issues. The two remained locked in a bitter legal battle for months involving property, cash and Adelson\u2019s mother wanting access to their children.\n\nOver the course of five years, investigators combed through traffic surveillance tapes and car rental records, recorded calls and even employed a FBI sting operation to bring those they suspect are responsible for Markel\u2019s death to justice.\n\nThe story that follows is based on the conclusions of the investigators about the two accused hit men who shot Markel in cold blood and who may have paid them.\n\n*Watch the full story on \"20/20\" FRIDAY at 9 p.m. ET on ABC*\n\nThe day of the murder\n\nAt 11 a.m. on July 18, 2014, as Dan Markel was pulling into his garage, he got a call and told the man on the line there was someone he didn\u2019t recognize in his driveway. There was a muffled sound and Markel was never heard from again.\n\nMarkel\u2019s next door neighbor heard what he thought might be gunshots, went over to Markel\u2019s garage to investigate and then ran back to his home to call 911, telling the operator, \"His driver\u2019s side window was shattered and he\u2019s spattered and can\u2019t answer. He\u2019s inside the car, the car is running, and he\u2019s got blood all over his head. He\u2019s not responding to me.\"\n\nMarkel was rushed to a local hospital with two gunshot wounds to his head. Tallahassee police officers located his ex-wife Wendi Adelson early that afternoon at a local restaurant, where she was having lunch with friends, and drove her to the police station where they explained the details of the shooting.\n\n\"That\u2019s what this is about,\" the officer told her as she began to break down in tears. \"There was a shooting at your home, or your ex-husband\u2019s home. [He] has been taken to the hospital. He\u2019s not going to survive.\"\n\n\"What happened? ... I just don\u2019t understand? How could this happen?\" Adelson said on the police interview tape, sobbing. \"My ex-husband caused me a lot of grief, but I would never do something like that.\"\n\nPlay\n\nThe interview went on for more than five hours. Adelson told police that she was in fear and worried that whoever shot Markel could be coming for her children next.\n\nShe was forthcoming about their divorce, and willingly allowed police to look at her phone, swab her for fingerprints and photograph her. She was not arrested.\n\nAbout 15 hours after he was shot, Markel was pronounced dead.\n\nPolice found no evidence of a break-in at Markel\u2019s home and swiftly determined that the shooting was no random act and that someone wanted him dead.\n\nGiven Markel\u2019s legal and academic background, police initially probed whether a disgruntled student or reader of his controversial blog could be responsible.\n\nQuestioning the ex-wife\u2019s former boyfriend\n\nThree days after questioning Adelson, police brought in fellow FSU professor and Adelson\u2019s ex-boyfriend Jeffrey Lacasse for questioning on July 21, 2014.\n\nPolice verified that Lacasse had been hundreds of miles away at the time of the murder, but over the course of three lengthy interviews, Lacasse gave police his theories about the crime.\n\n\"I have something I want to tell you, but I\u2019m concerned about my safety\u2026to be honest,\" Lacasse told police. \"Danny Markel just got\u2026 killed and I don\u2019t want to be next. I\u2019m sorry if that sounds paranoid, but I do have some ideas.\"\n\nTallahassee Police Department\n\n\"The family desperately wants [Wendi] back in South Florida. \u2026 They hate Danny in a way. I have never seen this kind of obsession. I mean, their hobby is hating Danny,\" Lacasse is heard telling police on video recorded during his interview. \"I would just say, I would be investigating Charlie Adelson. I don't know if he did this, but if you are looking at someone, don't miss him.\"\n\nPlay\n\n\"She told me that Charlie had looked into having Danny killed in the summer of 2013,\" Lacasse told police. \"She meant it dead serious. He said it would cost about $15,000.\"\n\nWendi had told police that Charlie \"makes a lot of jokes in bad taste\", including when he gave her a divorce present and told her he had \"looked into hiring a hit man \u2026 it was cheaper to get you a TV, so instead I got you this TV.\"\n\nThe Toyota Prius\n\nTallahassee police's first big break came when they pulled surveillance video from Markel\u2019s gym on the day of his death. They could see a Toyota Prius following Markel\u2019s car out of his gym parking lot.\n\nPolice later obtained video shot from a city bus and intersection cameras of what they believed was the same Toyota Prius. They noticed a toll transponder on the windshield. They launched a search all over the state of Florida for records of the same make and model Prius that also had a toll transponder used around the time of the murder.\n\nTallahassee Police Department\n\nToll records led them to a car rental agency in Miami. The rental agreement for the car showed that it was rented by a man named Luis Rivera. Using the listed cellphone number, police were quickly able to confirm Rivera\u2019s identity.\n\nPolice say Rivera is a leader in the North Miami branch of the notorious Latin Kings gang.\n\nA second telephone number was also written on the rental contract with the word \"Brother\" written beside the number. That cellphone number tracked back to Sigfredo \"Tuto\" Garcia of North Miami. Garcia is a childhood friend of Rivera\u2019s who also has a felony record and has had more than 20 run-ins with the law.\n\nTallahassee Police Department\n\nUsing cellphone data and GPS info, police said they were able to determine that the two men had been in the vicinity of Markel\u2019s home at the time of the murder.\n\nIn May 2016, police announced first-degree murder charges against Rivera and Garcia. They were both indicted in June 2016 and faced the death penalty if convicted. Both entered not guilty pleas.\n\nMiami Dade Police Department\n\nKatie Magbanua\n\nThe question investigators were then trying to answer is, why would these two men from South Florida drive nearly 500 miles north to Tallahassee to kill Dan Markel? If Garcia and Rivera didn\u2019t have a link to Markel, police believed they must have been hired by someone who did.\n\nPolice looked into Katie Magbanua, who has two children with Garcia. They discovered that from 2013 to early 2015, Magbanua dated Wendi\u2019s brother Charlie Adelson \u2013 a period that overlaps Markel\u2019s murder.\n\nIn the months after the murder, investigators found Magbanua collected regular paychecks from the Adelsons\u2019 family dental practice, Adelson Institute, signed by Donna Adelson, Wendi and Charlie Adelson\u2019s mother.\n\nBroward Sheriffs Office\n\nAccording to investigators, there was no record of any work schedule or job title for Magbanua in paperwork subpoenaed from the dentistry business.\n\nUndercover sting operation\n\nIn April 2016, authorities staked out Donna Adelson as part of an undercover operation. During the sting, an undercover FBI agent wearing a recording device, approached her, claiming to be the brother of one of the suspects.\n\n\"He helped your family with this problem you guys had up north,\" the agent is heard saying to Adelson. \"He\u2019s going through some rough times and I want to make sure that you take care of what he\u2019s going through the way you\u2019re taking care of Katie and Tuto.\"\n\nAdelson insisted, \"I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\"\n\nThe agent handed her a picture of Markel and then left. Adelson later called the agent, telling him she had nothing to do with her former son-in-law\u2019s death, and didn\u2019t know what his demand had to do with her.\n\nThe undercover agent, still posing as the suspect\u2019s brother, demanded $5,000. Adelson then said she\u2019d call him back. Adelson then called her son, Charlie, in a conversation that was secretly recorded by authorities.\n\n\"Does it involve me or other people?\" Charlie Adelson asked.\n\n\"Well, probably the both of us,\" his mother replied. \"You probably have a general idea what I\u2019m talking about. So let\u2019s just find some time to talk to each other.\"\n\nIn another undercover phone recording, Charlie is heard calling Magbanua, demanding to \"find out who\u2026 it is and tell them to stop playing their games\u2026 I don't know who you have to talk to, but it needs to be nipped in the bud.\"\n\nThough police thought the conversations were suspicious, they never got a confession on tape.\n\nLuis Rivera cooperates with authorities\n\nWhile the Adelsons carried on with life in Miami, Rivera was in prison on another charge when prosecutors offered him a plea deal: If he would describe his role in the murder of Dan Markel, he could plead guilty to second-degree murder but avoid the possibility of the death penalty.\n\nIn October 2016, Rivera decided to cooperate. He gave a statement to prosecutors, in which he said his longtime friend Sigfredo Garcia asked him to come along with him to carry out a hit and showed him a photo of Dan Markel.\n\n\"He said he was going to pay me to go with him, because he didn't want to go by himself,\" Rivera told prosecutors. \"I asked him, who\u2019s ------ hiring me? He\u2019s like, \u2018Katie [Magbanua] told me this lady\u2019s going to hire me, but I want you to go with me. I\u2019ll give you $35,000.\u2019 I said, \u2018All right, for the drive? All right.\u2019 \u2026 Katie's the one in the middle doing everything. [Garcia] put it like that.\"\n\nMiami Dade Police Department\n\n\"I asked him, \u2018Why are you going to kill this guy?\u2019 \u2026 [Garcia said] \u2018Because the lady wants her two kids back. She wants full custody of them kids,\u2019\" Rivera continued. Rivera told prosecutors that in summer 2014, the two found Markel and trailed him for a few days. He said at one point, they followed him home and Garcia was the one who fatally shot Markel.\n\n\"As I'm following [Markel] home, he goes around the back. I go around the front. We met right in the garage. I was maybe three or four feet away from his car,\" Rivera said. \"Garcia jumps out, goes around the car, and when he's driving. I think Markel's on the phone that day. Shot him twice, got in the car, we left. Kept driving.\"\n\nPlay\n\nRivera told prosecutors the first person Garcia spoke with after the murder was Magbanua.\n\n\"He said, \u2018Everything is done. Make sure you have my money,\u2019\" Rivera said, adding he could \"100%\" hear Magbanua\u2019s voice on the other end.\n\nKatie Magbanua arrested for murder of Dan Markel\n\nMagbanua was charged with first-degree murder and she and Garcia are currently standing trial for their roles in Markel\u2019s death.\n\nIn the ongoing trial, prosecutors have argued that Magbanua was hired to solicit Garcia, who in turn solicited Rivera\u2019s help to murder Markel.\n\nIn Luis Rivera\u2019s damning testimony on the witness stand recounting the plan and murder, he pointed his finger directly at both Garcia and Magbanua.\n\nGarcia\u2019s attorney attacked Rivera, grilling him about his membership in the Latin Kings gang.\n\nMagbanua took the stand on Wednesday and testified that she had nothing to do with Markel\u2019s murder and had no knowledge he had been killed.\n\nAttorneys for each of the Adelsons issued a joint statement denying any involvement in the crime. None of the Adelsons has been charged.\n\n\"For five years, the state has picked through every piece of Charlie\u2019s life ... looking for any excuse to charge him,\" Charlie Adelson\u2019s attorney told ABC News. \"But there is nothing there. There\u2019s no case against Charlie.\"\n\nDan Markel\u2019s father Phil Markel said the ongoing proceedings are \"a very heavy burden.\"\n\n\"We just hope that justice will eventually be done. That was Danny's big thing, justice. That's what he taught and that's what he believed in. And we're just waiting for justice to be done,\" Markel said.", "description": "FSU law professor Dan Markel was fatally shot in his garage the morning of July 18, 2014.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/HT_Markel_ml_140722_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
