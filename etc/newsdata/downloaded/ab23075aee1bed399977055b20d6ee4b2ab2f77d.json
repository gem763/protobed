Elizabeth Warren any further after transcripts of candid comments he made about her were leaked this week.\n\nAt a livestreamed Q&A with Facebook employees, Zuckerberg talked about leaked remarks he made to employees in July, when he said he was ready to \u201cgo to the mat \u2026 and fight\u201d if the Massachusetts Democrat becomes president and attempts to break up tech giants like Facebook.\n\n\u201cSure, I may have said it in more of an unfiltered way, but fundamentally we believe in everything that was in there,\u201d he said of the audio recordings published Tuesday by The Verge. \u201cAt this point, I do such a bad job at interviews, it\u2019s like, \u2018What do we have to lose?\u2019\u201d\n\nWarren responded to Zuckerberg\u2019s leaked comments by doubling down on her plan to break up Big Tech, saying: \u201cWhat would really \u2019suck\u2019 is if we don\u2019t fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s livestream came out as Attorney General William Barr joined officials from Britain and Australia in asking the Facebook CEO to delay plans to encrypt its messaging services, including Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram.\n\nA letter dated for Friday and obtained by BuzzFeed says that end-to-end encryption will prevent law enforcement from being able to track illegal activity on the platforms, and it requests that Facebook allow law enforcement backdoor access into such messaging.\n\nAt the Q&A on Thursday, Zuckerberg said that he understands officials\u2019 concerns and that the issue is \u201cone of the core tensions that I think we face.\u201d But a Facebook spokesperson told the Daily Beast that the company will \u201cstrongly oppose attempts to build backdoors because they would undermine the privacy and security of people everywhere.\u201d", "description": "The Facebook CEO spoke of his candid comments about Sen.
