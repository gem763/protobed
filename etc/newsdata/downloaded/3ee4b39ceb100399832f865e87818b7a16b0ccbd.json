French Guiana waters are a crucial place for the survival of many cetacean species,\u201d he explained.\n\nFor Edina Ifticene of Greenpeace\u2019s Protect the Oceans campaign, the discovery of these creatures showed \u201cit doesn\u2019t make sense to drill for oil in such a critical environment; an oil spill could have irreversible consequences for the entire area.\u201d\n\nNot only that but exploting oil deposits threatens to undermine the fight against climate change caused by planet-warming gases emitted as humanity burns fossil fuels for energy.\n\n\u2013 Fish, food at risk \u2013\n\nBrazil\u2019s ANP petroleum agency has estimated the area may hold as much as 14 billion barrels of oil \u2014 a quantity scientists say could release 5.2 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\n\nAccording to the International Energy Agency, global energy-related CO2 emissions rose to a historic high of 33.1 Gt last year.\n\nScientists say we need to leave at least 80 percent of the world\u2019s known remaining fossil fuel reserves in the ground to prevent runaway climate change.\n\nLast week, the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change cautioned that ocean warming and changes in sea chemistry, caused by CO2 absorption, is harming ocean life and the people who depend on it.\n\n\u201cShifts in the distribution of fish populations have reduced the global catch potential,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cCommunities that depend highly on seafood may face risks to nutritional health and food security.\u201d\n\nRuben, a fisherman from the small coastal community of Kali\u2019na said he feared for the future.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s bad for us. It\u2019s what I think. The petrol is dangerous,\u201d he said on a stopover by the Esperanza.", "description": "Cayenne (AFP) \u2013 Off the coast of Guiana, a French overseas department perched on the north coast of South America, scientists scour the choppy", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/06/571d2f_in-2013-british-oil-giant-bp-french-company-total-brazil-petrobras-joined-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
