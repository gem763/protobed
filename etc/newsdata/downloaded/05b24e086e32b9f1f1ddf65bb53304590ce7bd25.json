Trump ultimately scrapped the idea, but multiple people familiar with the issue said the news reports about Bolton\u2019s dissent \u2014 believed to have been planted by Bolton aides \u2014 infuriated Trump.\n\nBolton\u2019s ouster leaves yet another vacancy in the upper echelons of the Trump administration, where many roles are either unfilled or filled on an acting basis, including several that deal with national security issues. It also means Trump could hear fewer dissenting voices on major moves he wants to make on the national security front, such as talking to the leaders of Iran.\n\nThe president himself didn\u2019t get too specific in his tweets announcing Bolton\u2019s departure, though he indicated it was not a spur of the moment move.\n\n\"I informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House,\" Trump wrote. \"I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration, and therefore ... I asked John for his resignation, which was given to me this morning. I thank John very much for his service.\"\n\nBolton offered a conflicting account on Twitter minutes after Trump's posts. \"I offered to resign last night and President Trump said, 'Let's talk about it tomorrow,'\" he wrote online. Bolton did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe news caught many in the administration off guard. Shortly before Trump\u2019s tweets, the White House had announced that Bolton would appear at a briefing later Tuesday with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The two Cabinet secretaries, both of whom had their own frustrations with Bolton, appeared together, and in good spirits.\n\nI offered to resign last night and President Trump said, \"Let's talk about it tomorrow.\" \u2014 John Bolton (@AmbJohnBolton) September 10, 2019\n\nPeople familiar with the issue said Trump grew frustrated over time with news stories about divisions in the administration that he was convinced were peddled by Bolton and his media surrogates.\n\nOver the weekend, as reports in The New York Times and other outlets laid out the back-and-forth within the administration over whether to invite the Taliban to Camp David, Trump \u2014 as well as other officials like Pompeo \u2014 grew upset at what they were sure were leaks from Bolton and his aides.\n\n\u201cWhen the New York Times story came out, it was pretty clear that Bolton or his people had his fingerprints all over it, that it wasn\u2019t his idea to meet with the Taliban, that it was Pompeo\u2019s. That was the end of business. It was petty and stupid,\u201d said a Trump confidante familiar with the president's thinking.\n\nA second person confirmed that explanation, saying that it was part of a pattern of leaks believed to have come from Bolton\u2019s camp that highlighted dissent in the president\u2019s inner circle.\n\n\"The fundamental problem here is the president had a national security adviser who was unwilling to accept the decisions made by the president,\" this person said. \"When they contradicted his opinion, he worked to undermine them.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s safe to say that the entire administration that is on the national security team has talked to the president about their frustrations,\" the person added.\n\nOn Monday night, Bolton and Trump met in the Oval Office before the president took off for a rally in North Carolina, according to White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham.\n\nIt was at that meeting that Trump asked for Bolton's resignation, she said. Asked whether the tenor of the conversation was negative, Grisham replied: \"I mean, he was asked for his resignation...\"\n\nBolton's resignation letter, dated Tuesday, was terse: \"I hereby resign, effective immediately, as Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs. Thank you for having afforded me this opportunity to serve our country.\"\n\nSome administration officials appeared pleased when they appeared Tuesday afternoon. When Pompeo was asked whether he was blindsided, he quipped, \"I'm never surprised,\" and broke into a grin.", "description": "The president says he asked for Bolton to leave.
