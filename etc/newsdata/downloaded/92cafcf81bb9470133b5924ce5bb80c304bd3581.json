There is practically no doubt that it will poll first in Sunday\u2019s elections \u2013 the question is whether it will be able to win a majority.\n\nPawel Zerka, a policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, told The Independent that there could yet be an upset.\n\n\u201cMobilisation of voters is the biggest unknown of these elections. On the face of it, the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party looks set to win at least 231 seats \u2013 an absolute majority \u2013 in the country\u2019s lower legislative chamber, the Sejm,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut at the same time, PiS supporters seem to be much less motivated to vote than Poles who back the opposition.\u201d\n\nOne poll commissioned by the European Council on Foreign Relations in early September found that just 49 per cent of PiS supporters are committed to voting, compared with between 70 and 75 per cent for the two main opposition blocs \u2013 suggesting turnout could be a deciding factor.\n\nThe lack of enthusiasm for the ruling party despite their commanding lead also shows up in other figures. A poll conducted by Kantar at the beginning of October asked voters which scenario they preferred: an opposition victory, a PiS single-party government, or PiS having to rule with another party.\n\nJaroslaw Kaczynski, leader of Poland\u2019s ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, speaks during the party\u2019s campaign convention in Kielce (AFP Photo / Getty Images) More\n\nJust 34 per cent said they wanted PiS to govern alone, while 36 per cent said they wanted the opposition parties to win. Twenty-four per cent of voters said they preferred a PiS coalition with another party.\n\nBut the split opposition means PiS is likely to triumph. Mr Zerka said a majority for the incumbent ruling party was still \u201cthe most probable scenario\u201d but that other results should not be ruled out.\n\n\u201cRather than seeking a coalition partner, [Jaroslaw] Kaczynski\u2019s party [Law and Justice] may then try to recruit from other parties the few parliamentarians it would need to form a stable majority,\u201d said Mr Zerka.\n\n\u201cBut, at the same time, opposition parties might get an opportunity to build a counter-alternative.\u201d\n\nAn opposition coalition could be difficult to build, especially if the agrarian peasants\u2019 party and their anti-system allies win enough votes to enter the parliament. Such a coalition would have to stretch from social and economic liberals, through economic leftists, to social conservatives.\n\nThe left-wingers are expected to return to the parliament for the first time in four years, after having been wiped out at the last election. Various left-of-centre parties have formed a single group in order to maximise their chances of winning seats.\n\nThe latest voting intention poll by Kantar has PiS and its allies on 43 per cent, the centre-right liberal Civic Platform on 28 per cent, and the left-of-centre Lewica on 13 per cent.\n\nRead more\n\nSocialists set to make comeback in Polish elections next month\n\nPolish populist government\u2019s court reforms were illegal, says ECJ\n\nPoland scraps income tax for young people to tempt emigrants home", "description": "Voters in Poland will give their verdict on four years of populist government on Sunday, with the country\u2019s ruling party expected to triumph again.The right-wing Law and Justice (PiS) party came to power in 2015 promising a heady mixture of social conservatism and increased spending on the welfare state", "authors": ["Jon Stone"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1spgEItSuaTb8GQsFP5lTg--~B/aD0zNDY7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/84364883136b27bf4d20def0c33acd19", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
