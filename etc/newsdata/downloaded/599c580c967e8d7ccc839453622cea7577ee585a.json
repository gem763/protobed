Even as other markets nationwide have experienced increases in the number of homes for sale and slowing price increases, the capital region remains a seller\u2019s market in many neighborhoods.\n\n\u201cThe things that have been driving the market so far this year aren\u2019t changing, so this fall we\u2019ll see more of the same in the regional housing market,\u201d says Chris Finnegan, vice president of marketing and communications for Bright MLS.\n\nThose driving forces, Finnegan says, include low mortgage rates, strong employment and the Amazon effect, referring to the choice of National Landing in the Crystal City and Pentagon City areas of Arlington County, Va., for Amazon\u2019s second headquarters.\n\nThe region is economically healthy because of the strength of the local labor market, says Terry Clower, director of the Center for Regional Analysis at George Mason University, but, he points out, there\u2019s nothing more hyperlocal than the housing market.\n\n[How a 20-year home mortgage can save you a ton of money]\n\n\u201cEven when you have buyers looking for a quality school district, they go beyond that to look for a house within the catchment area of a particular school,\u201d Clower says. \u201cThere can be wide variations on home prices within adjacent neighborhoods because of the desirability of a particular school.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe four-bedroom, two-bathroom home at 6924 Randolph St. in Hyattsville, Md., is listing for $335,000. (Curt Ellis)\n\nAt the end of 2018, the regional housing market was affected heavily by a partial government shutdown, stock market volatility, and mortgage rates that were above 4.5 percent and anticipated to rise, says Ben Sage, director of the Mid-Atlantic region for Metrostudy, a housing market research and consulting firm.\n\n\u201cSince then, those hindrances to the housing market have mostly been resolved,\u201d Sage says. \u201cThe government reopened and the stock market stabilized, although it\u2019s suffered again lately. Most importantly, mortgage rates dropped down below 4 percent again and are anticipated to stay low.\u201d\n\nRecession fears have roiled the stock market in recent weeks, but Finnegan doesn\u2019t anticipate a recession harming the regional housing market anytime soon, particularly not this fall.\n\n\u201cThe supply of homes is extremely low, and what\u2019s on the market goes for premium prices,\u201d Finnegan says.\n\nLow mortgage rates have pushed home sales higher than anticipated this year, Clower says, because rates were expected to be higher. Lower mortgage rates reduce monthly interest payments and can help people qualify for a larger mortgage or feel more comfortable buying a slightly more expensive home.\n\n\n\nThe six-bedroom, three-bathroom home at 2713 James Dr. in Alexandria, Va., is listing for $779,600. (Real Tour)\n\nTale of three markets\n\nAlthough the housing market across the area is experiencing increasing prices, tight inventory and a steady pace of sales, there are differences in every county and neighborhood. Low inventory continues to plague the District and Northern Virginia, Finnegan says, while in Maryland, inventory shortages are less pronounced.\n\n\u201cThe District is an evergreen, blue chip market,\u201d Finnegan says. \u201cCondos in the city are selling fast because employment numbers are good and mortgage rates are low. First-time buyers are eager to get into the market.\u201d\n\nThe median sales price in the District climbed to $592,500 in July, up 4 percent over July 2018, according to the Greater Capital Area Association of Realtors. However, the number of homes sold in the District dropped by 6.8 percent in July compared to July 2018, in part because of continued lack of inventory, which was 1.3 percent lower this July than it was last July. As an indication of the competitiveness of the District\u2019s housing market, the average ratio of the sales price to the original list price was 99.4 percent in July.\n\nFinnegan says that in Maryland, the strongest markets for first-time buyers are in Silver Spring in Montgomery County and in Prince George\u2019s County because both areas have more affordable housing. In Prince George\u2019s County, perennially the most affordable in the region, the median sales price rose to $320,000 in July, a jump of 12.3 percent over July 2018, according to Bright.\n\n[30-year mortgage rate falls to its lowest level in nearly three years]\n\n\u201cIn Silver Spring and a lot of areas of Prince George\u2019s County, you\u2019re close to everything but you can get more house for your money than in the District or other suburbs,\u201d Finnegan says.\n\nNorthern Virginia, Finnegan says, is \u201con fire because of Amazon.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Amazon effect is most intense in the area surrounding National Landing, the site of Amazon\u2019s HQ2 headquarters, the Northern Virginia region also experienced a tightening market. The number of active listings declined by 31 percent in July compared to July 2018, according to the Northern Virginia Association of Realtors. The average days on the market dropped by 35 percent from 49 days in July 2018 to 32 days in July 2019. The median sales price rose by 1.45 percent in Northern Virginia, to $542,750.\n\nA recent analysis by Redfin found that the two most competitive markets in the country for buyers are Alexandria and Arlington, adjacent to the new Amazon headquarters. In both locations, Redfin\u2019s report says, the number of homes for sale fell by about 50 percent in July 2019 compared to July 2018. Homes that sold in July 2019 went off the market in a median of 11 days in Arlington and 24 days in Alexandria, far faster than the median of 27 days in the region and the 38-day national median.\n\n\u201cHomeowners in Arlington and the Zip codes around the Amazon headquarters are holding onto their properties to see how high values will go,\u201d Finnegan says. \u201cThose who do choose to sell now are asking higher prices and getting them because of the shortage of homes for sale.\u201d\n\n[Area residents, not Amazon newcomers, are fueling Northern Virginia real estate frenzy, agents say]\n\nThe Amazon effect is likely to have a domino effect as employees are hired, Sage says.\n\n\u201cSome families will prioritize schools and space and move to the best school districts, so we\u2019re likely to see more competition in Fairfax County, Loudoun County and even Montgomery County,\u201d Sage says.\n\nClower says some new Amazon hires are likely to move into the District, especially if they\u2019re single and want an urban environment. He says the Amazon decision should have a ripple effect and encourage more tech companies to locate to the region.\n\n\u201cAnother good impact is that this has called even more attention to the need for affordable housing in the area,\u201d Clower says.\n\nNew construction\n\nIncreasing density with mid-rise and high-rise condos as well as townhouses and stacked condos that look like townhouses is likely to be part of the mix of new housing in the District and surrounding suburbs to address the need for more housing as well as affordability, Sage says.\n\n\u201cMore construction is needed to address the limited inventory among existing homes and also because some listings that are available don\u2019t match what people want,\u201d Sage says. \u201cNew homes offer fresh floor plans, low maintenance and allow some level of personalization.\u201d\n\nThe areas with the most new construction in the D.C. region are Prince George\u2019s County, Anne Arundel County and Frederick County in Maryland.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just not as much land in Northern Virginia compared to those Maryland counties,\u201d Sage says.\n\nOne trend Sage has identified is that home buyers are more sensitive to being closer to where they work.\n\n\u201cThe old \u2018drive until you qualify\u2019 mentality is less common, which is why you see more people willing to compromise and either continue to rent or to buy a townhouse or condo rather than move farther out,\u201d Sage says.\n\nClower says that although larger houses still sell, there\u2019s a shift in consumer preferences.\n\n\u201cThe big home on a large lot near public transit is not a hot market,\u201d Clower says. \u201cIn every pocket of the region, we\u2019re starting to see more opportunities for a variety of housing, including high-rise buildings, townhouses and traditional single-family homes. The goal is to build homes that are accessible and affordable to people in different phases of their lives.\u201d\n\nFor now, buyers should expect to continue to compete for homes in desirable neighborhoods this fall.", "description": "High prices and a limited number of homes for sale continue to drive the market.", "authors": ["Michele Lerner", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/6c67rrUntPvS1-FvfQM5TlhwNgk=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TNDO72WTIMI6TBVMB4SQZSIXLA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
