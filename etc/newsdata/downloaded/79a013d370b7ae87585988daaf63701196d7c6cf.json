And when you look at that, under Duke of York it shows Buckingham Palace London.\n\n\u2018He has thirteen phone number to contact the Duke. And (these numbers went everywhere), Wood Farm, Sunninghill Wood Farm, Sunninghill numbers, the Palace, his home number, his home email. He even had a phone number to his modem, I guess to call into his modem.\u2019\n\nThe Duke of York is alleged to have visited Epstein\u2019s \u2018pedo island\u2019 on a number of occasions (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nThe private investigator was one of the first to interview Virginia Roberts, who has repeatedly claimed that Prince Andrew had sex with her when she was aged just 17.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTonight\u2019s Dispatches documentary examines 1,200 pages of documents made public by a Manhattan court, which reveal Ms Roberts claimed that the third time she \u2018had sex with Andy\u2019 was during an orgy involving Epstein and \u2018eight other young girls.\u2019\n\nShe made the claims in a court deposition made on January 19, 2015 as part of a defamation case brought by her against Epstein\u2019s former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nHer testimony said: \u2018The third time I had sex with Andy was in an orgy on Epstein\u2019s private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands. I was around 18 at the time. Epstein, Andy, approximately eight other young girls, and I had sex together.\n\n\u2018The other girls all seemed and appeared to be under the age of 18 and didn\u2019t really speak English. Epstein laughed about the fact they couldn\u2019t really communicate, saying that they are the \u2018easiest\u2019 girls to get along with.\u2019\n\nPrince Andrew and Virginia Roberts, aged 17, pictured together at Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s townhouse in London in 2001 (Picture: Rex Features)\n\nShe had also claimed that Epstein\u2019s friends had \u2018dark sexual appetites\u2019.\n\nA judge in a civil case threw out Ms Roberts\u2019 evidence as impertinent and immaterial in May 2015.\n\nThe Channel 4 programme has since obtained medical records which show she suffered three weeks of vaginal bleeding, dizziness, nausea, vomiting and \u2018sharp, low abdominal pain\u2019 on 9th of July 2001, three months after she claims she had sex with Prince Andrew.\n\nTonight\u2019s documentary will come as a blow to Prince Andrew, who has continuously denied witnessing Epstein doing anything illegal during their friendship and having sex with Ms Roberts.\n\nEpstein killed himself in prison in August (Picture: New York State Sex Offender Registry)\n\nIt has previously been claimed that Epstein\u2019s house keeper in Palm Beach had seen the Prince visiting the mansion three or four times, and claimed that he would receive massages from girls who were staying there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a lengthy interview with Dispatches, Mr Fisten said it would be \u2018impossible\u2019 for Epstein\u2019s friends and acquaintances to spend any amount of time around him without having their suspicions aroused as to his behaviour towards young women.\n\nHe said: \u2018When people tell me, I didn\u2019t know what Jeffrey was about, I don\u2019t want to say BS. I\u2019ll just say hogwash. Because if you were around Jeffrey you were around underage girls. He has no children. He has no nieces\u2026 Come on. It doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to figure out that something was going on there.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nEpstein, who was facing 40 years in jail for sex trafficking charges, committed suicide from his prison cell in August.\n\nMr Fisten said he was shocked by what he came across during his enquiries.\n\nHe said: \u2018When you talk to these girls \u2026 your hearts had to pour out to them because they were so vulnerable.\n\n\u2018Some girls would tell me that they would have to wear the same outfit to school every single day, and then wash it in the sink.\n\nThey just barely had enough food to eat\u2026 This is the type he looked for, the younger the better, the more in need, the better for him.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier this year Buckingham Palace said: \u2018Any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.\u2019 and \u2018It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact with Virginia Roberts. Any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation.\u2019\n\nPrince Andrew said: \u2018At no stage during the limited time I spent with him did I see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
