But, in more recent reports regarding a California law, news outlets are now using the phrase \u201cabortion medication.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s wording that shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly; abortion is anything but medication.\n\nThe phrase surfaced when California's Democratic governor, Gary Newsom, signed S.B. 24, or the \u201cCollege Student Right to Access Act\u201d on October 11. The legislation requires \u201ceach student health care services clinic on a California State University or University of California campus to offer abortion by medication techniques\u201d beginning in 2023.\n\nWhile the law itself didn\u2019t say \u201cabortion medication,\u201d it deemed abortion a necessity and, even, a good thing.\n\nThe law stressed the importance of minimizing \u201cthe negative impact of health concerns on students\u2019 studies and to facilitate retention and graduation\u201d and that \u201chaving early, accessible care can help them stay on track to achieve their educational and other aspirational life plans.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the law read, women need abortions. But nothing is more demeaning than to suggest that a woman\u2019s success depends on ending another\u2019s life. Instead, law and society should strive to empower women to be successful while, at the same time, accommodating for and appreciating their unique ability to grow a human person.\n\nThe media also elevated abortion, but as a medication \u2013 a cure for a disease.\n\nOn October 11, ABC News published an Associated Press piece with the headline, \u201cCalifornia to require abortion medication at public colleges.\u201d\n\nLikewise, NBC News posted the Associated Press report with a similar headline: \u201cCalifornia will require public colleges to stock abortion medication.\u201d\n\n\u201cCalifornia will be the first state to require abortion medication on college campuses,\u201d the piece read, before noting that the \u201cmedication is an option for women who are less than 10 weeks pregnant.\u201d\n\nThat same day, CBS News\u2019 headline read, \u201cCalifornia becomes first state to require access to abortion medication at public colleges.\u201d\n\n\u201c[A]ll 34 University of California and California State University systems will need to provide the medication,\u201d wrote Sophie Lewis.\n\nShe continued to call abortion \u201cmedication\u201d throughout the piece.\n\n\u201cSupporters argued centers are difficult to access for students without cars and the cost of the medication could be out of reach for many,\u201d she added, before pointing to how one study \u201calso found the average cost of the medication was $604.\u201d\n\nWomen\u2019s sites like Refinery29 also joined in.\n\nWriter Alejandra Salazar emphasized that \u201cCalifornia will be the first state in the U.S. to require access to abortion medication on its public university campuses\u201d on October 12.\n\n\u201cSupporters of the SB-24 say this bill supports many students, especially low-income and first-generation students who are unable to pay for the medication\u201d and lack transportation, she wrote.\n\nShe called abortion \u201cmedication\u201d a second time when she added, \u201cThe average cost of medication was $604.\u201d\n\nBustle chimed in on October 17. Referencing a Los Angeles Times piece, writer Carolyn de Lorenzo stressed that \u201cabortion medication aborts a fertilized egg.\u201d\n\nBut abortion, even an early one by pill, sounds nothing like medication. Instead, according to dictionaries like Merriam-Webster, medication is a \u201csubstance used in treating disease or relieving pain.\u201d\n\nAbortion is neither.\n\nAn obstetrician-gynecologist who once performed more than 1,200 abortions, collaborated with pro-life group Live Action in 2016 to describe abortion procedures. In one video, Dr. Anthony Levatino details the \u201ctwo steps\u201d of medication abortion.\n\n\u201cAt the abortion clinic or doctor\u2019s office, the woman takes pills which contain Mifepristone,\u201d or RU-486, he said. RU-486 blocks the hormone progesterone, which causes the \u201clining of the mother\u2019s uterus\u201d to break down, \u201ccutting off blood and nourishment to the baby.\u201d\n\nFor the next step, the woman takes Misoprostol, or Cytotec, a day or two later. Together, he continued, RU-486 and Misoprostol \u201ccause severe cramping, contractions, and often heavy bleeding to force the dead baby out of the woman\u2019s uterus.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe process can be very intense and painful,\u201d he warned, \u201cand the bleeding and contractions can last for a few hours to several days.\u201d Oftentimes, he said, the woman will \u201csit on a toilet as she prepares to expel the child which she will then flush.\u201d\n\nBut before that takes place, \u201cshe may even see her dead baby.\u201d If the abortion takes place at nine weeks, he said, the baby \u201cwill be almost an inch long\u201d and the woman \u201cmight be able count the fingers and toes.\u201d\n\nThe purpose of healthcare \u2013 medicine \u2013 is to save lives. But the purpose of abortion is to end them.", "description": "Many in the media report on \u201cmedication abortion\u201d as a .10/22/2019 11:06:03AM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Yoder", "Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa", "Julio Rosas", "Guy Benson"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/198/a4e356e1-adac-401e-8d03-fb5cc0029277.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
