USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In a startling development that vastly alters the complexion of the World Series at its most pivotal moment, Washington Nationals ace Max Scherzer will not start Sunday night\u2019s Game 5 after suffering severe irritation in a neck nerve and right trapezius, manager Dave Martinez announced.\n\nJoe Ross will start in place of Scherzer, who started and won Game 1. While Martinez said Scherzer may return later in the series, either in relief of Stephen Strasburg in Game 6 or starting a potential Game 7, the nature of this injury makes that scenario unlikely at best.\n\nThe Nationals and Astros are tied 2-2 and the Astros have AL Cy Young candidate Gerrit Cole aligned to start opposite Ross. After a travel day to Houston Monday, Strasburg will start Tuesday's Game 6, with a potential Game 7 scheduled Wednesday at Minute Maid Park.\n\nScherzer received a cortisone shot Sunday that he said would alleviate the pain in his neck nerve over the next 48 hours.\n\n\"I'm just hoping the doctors are right and I can (pitch) in Game 7,\" he said.\n\nRight now, that looks like a minor miracle.\n\n\"I can't pick up my arm right now,\" says Scherzer. \"So I can't pitch.\"\n\nScherzer noted he could not perform \"menial tasks\" after awakening Sunday morning and had to have his wife, Erica, help him get dressed.\n\n\"When I woke up this morning, I was completely locked up,\" Scherzer said.\n\n\"I'm as disappointed as I possibly could be. It's Game 5 of the World Series. I've pitched through so much crap in my career that that would be easy to pitch through at this point. This is literally impossible to do anything with.\"\n\nMartinez said Scherzer was \"jacked up and in a lot of pain. \"I\u2019ve never seen Max so quiet. He was very quiet.\n\n\u201cFor Max to miss a game, especially a game like this, he\u2019s got to be really hurt.\u201d\n\nGAME 5: Security tight for Trump's visit\n\nASTROS: Houston has its swagger back\n\nNationals general manager Mike Rizzo said he got a text message from Scherzer on Sunday morning letting him know he wouldn't be able to pitch.\n\nScherzer, 35, spent two stints on the injured list this season with a back injury. He returned from the second episode in August and ramped up to near full workload in September, but posted a 5.16 ERA in five starts that month.\n\nHe\u2019s been better in the postseason, winning his last three starts, including a Game 1 triumph over Houston and Cole in this World Series.\n\nScherzer said the current injury is unrelated to his previous ailment, which was confined to the lower back area. He said his neck began spasming a couple of days ago, but believed the Nationals' medical and training staff found a way to ease it on Saturday. He played catch, believing he'd still start Game 5.\n\nInstead, it will be Ross, with Scherzer, a three-time Cy Young winner likely headed to the Hall of Fame, left to ponder the horrible timing of this most debilitating injury.", "description": "Joe Ross will start in his place for the Nationals with the World Series tied at two games apiece.", "authors": ["Gabe Lacques", "Published P.M.
