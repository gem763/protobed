In a letter to Kupperman\u2019s lawyer issued Saturday, the House Democrat leaders cautioned that his absence may prompt them to \u201cdraw adverse inference\u201d that his testimony would have fueled their impeachment agenda.\n\nIn other words, Democrats may assume Kupperman would have said something against the president if he does not testify.\n\nDemocrats have cautioned witnesses and agencies that defying subpoenas amounts to obstruction of Congress, which they could cite in articles of impeachment. Kupperman, however, is reportedly the first impeachment probe witness to be threatened with contempt for not appearing.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) lamented to reporters Monday that it was \u201cdeeply regrettable\u201d that Kupperman was a \u201cno-show.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was compelled to appear with a lawful congressional subpoena,\u201d Schiff added. \u201cWitnesses like Dr. Kupperman need to do their duty and show up.\u201d\n\nJim Jordan from Ohio, the top Republican on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, confirmed that Kupperman would wait to testify until a judge rules on the congressional subpoena compelling him to do so.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s waiting on the court to rule \u2026 if the court says he has to come, he\u2019s more than willing to come,\u201d Jordan told reporters on Capitol Hill.\n\nCharles Cooper, Kupperman\u2019s attorney, told House Democrat investigators in a letter delivered Sunday, that his client would not give a deposition until a court rules on a lawsuit surrounding his appearance, the Hill noted.\n\nKupperman filed a lawsuit Friday essentially asking the courts to rule on whether he should testify.\n\nThe former top aide to former White House national security adviser John Bolton is worried that his testimony would \u201cinflict grave Constitutional injury on either the House or the President,\u201d USA Today reported, adding:\n\nKupperman noted in the 17-page filing that if he defies Trump, he could hurt the president\u2019s ability to receive confidential advice from top aides. But if he defies the House subpoena, he could impede their constitutional duty to investigate potential impeachment and could be subject to criminal penalties for contempt. Kupperman said he didn\u2019t take a position on whether the executive or legislative branch should prevail, but that the judicial branch should resolve the dispute.\n\nIn the letter to Democrat investigators, Cooper declared:\n\nWe want to assure your clients, again, that it is not Dr. Kupperman who contests your clients\u2019 constitutional claim. It is President Trump. If your clients\u2019 position on the merits of this issue is correct, it will prevail in court, and Dr. Kupperman, I assure you again, will comply with the court\u2019s judgment.\n\nHouse Democrat chairman pursuing the impeachment probe \u2014 from the Committees on Oversight and Reform, Intelligence, and Foreign Affairs \u2014 are seemingly fuming over Kupperman\u2019s refusal to testify.\n\nCooper\u2019s correspondence Sunday came in response to a letter issued Saturday by House Democrat leaders, threatening to hold Kupperman in contempt.\n\nIn the letter sent to Kupperman\u2019s counsels Saturday, the chairmen noted:\n\nKupperman\u2019s lawsuit\u2014lacking in legal merit and apparently coordinated with the White House\u2014is an obvious and desperate tactic by the president to delay and obstruct the lawful constitutional functions of Congress and conceal evidence about his conduct from the impeachment inquiry. Notwithstanding this attempted obstruction, the duly authorized subpoena remains in full force, and Dr. Kupperman remains legally obligated to appear for the deposition on Monday. The deposition will begin on time and, should your client defy the subpoena, his absence will constitute evidence that may be used against him in a contempt proceeding. In light of the direction from the White House, which lacks any valid legal basis, the Committees shall consider your client\u2019s defiance of a congressional subpoena as additional evidence of the president\u2019s obstruction of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry. Such willful defiance of a duly authorized subpoena may cause the Committees to draw an adverse inference against the President, including that your client\u2019s testimony would have corroborated other evidence gathered by the Committees showing that the President abused the power of his office by attempting to press another nation to assist his own personal political interests and not the national interest.\n\nThe White House has said it will not cooperate in the impeachment inquiry because it is \u201cillegitimate\u201d until the full House votes on the matter and unfair.\n\nKupperman was reportedly on the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that triggered the impeachment probe into claims that Trump asked for help in his reelection in 2020, the Hill noted.\n\nBolton is reportedly considering testifying in the impeachment probe.", "description": "Trump's former Deputy National Security Advisor Charles Kupperman defied a subpoena issued by Democrats in the ongoing impeachment probe.", "authors": ["Edwin Mora"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/28/661977_trump-impeachment-00804-adam-schiff-jamie-raskin-eric-swalwell-carolyn-e1572284929339-639x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
