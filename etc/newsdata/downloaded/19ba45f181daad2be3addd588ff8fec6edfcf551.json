The Kurds were the top US ally in the fight against ISIL in the region.\n\nAppearing to respond to the criticism earlier this week, Trump announced sanctions on certain Turkish officials, ratcheted up tariffs on the country's steel imports and suspended a major trade deal, but many politicians say the US response must go even further.\n\n\"We have always maintained that, while certainly needed, a sanctions package alone is insufficient for reversing this humanitarian disaster,\" House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nThe Democratic leaders were announcing plans for a House vote on Wednesday on a separate nonbinding resolution opposing Trump's withdrawal. That measure is expected to pass.\n\nThat measure says Turkey should halt military actions in Syria and says the US should send humanitarian aid to the embattled Kurds.\n\nIt also calls on Trump to produce \"a clear and specific plan for the enduring defeat\" of ISIL.\n\n191016063442043\n\nAn identical bipartisan measure is being introduced in the Senate.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell delivered a reminder on Tuesday that a veto-proof majority of 70 senators voted earlier this year against a troop withdrawal from Syria. He suggested Trump's move allowed Turkey to launch operations in northeast Syria, \"creating a power vacuum begging for the meddling influence of Russia\", and leaving Syria open for Iran to advance its reach \"unimpeded\" towards Israel.", "description": "Separately, the House plans to vote on a measure opposing Trump's decision to withdraw troops from northeast Syria.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/16/0de6e2c680f84bea8838a672afcbba55_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
