He was sensational again. He gave up two runs in the first inning on Alex Bregman\u2019s two-run homer, and that was it for the rest of his 114 pitches.\n\nHe sat on the bench in the top of the seventh and watched 36-year-old catcher Kurt Suzuki become the oldest player since 1949 to hit a go-ahead homer in the seventh inning or later. And then watched the Astros become unglued, and by the time the inning ended, the players were giving Strasburg a group hug.\n\nIt\u2019s not over, but plans for the parade route circling the nation\u2019s capital are underway.\n\n\"We know the series isn't over,\" said Nationals third baseman Anthony Rendon. \"I think it would have been a success if we only came in and stole one game, obviously, playing at this stage and playing with the crowd and at their home-field. But for us to obviously steal two games from them at their home-field is great.\"\n\nNEW LEADER: Move over Smoltz, JV new strikeout king\n\nQUESTIONS: Commissioner 'concerned' over Astros controversy\n\nJust once since 1985 has a team lost the first two games at home in a best-of-seven series and won the series, the last being the 1996 New York Yankees over the Atlanta Braves, starting the dynasty.\n\n\u201cWe respect the heck out of them,\u2019\u2019 Nats first baseman Ryan Zimmerman said, \u201cand we know we got a long way to go.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Nats will have Anibal Sanchez, who nearly threw a no-hitter in Game 1 of the NLCS against the Los Angeles Dodgers, in Game 3 vs. Zack Greinke.\n\nAdvantage Nats.\n\nThey will go with 14-game winner Patrick Corbin in Game 4 against the Astros\u2019 bullpen, or possibly Cole on short rest.\n\nAdvantage Nats again.\n\nThe Astros, who haven\u2019t been to Washington since 2014, can only hope the forecast for rain holds up in Washington over the weekend, slowing the Nats\u2019 momentum, and giving them enough time to pitch Cole and Verlander again.\n\nNo matter the odds, Nationals manager Dave Martinez is confident in his team.\n\n\"I wish I was a betting man, but I'm not,\" he said.\n\n\"What I believe in is hard work, being consistent in what we do, and sticking to our process, and we did that. I said it all along, when this team was down, I felt like we had starting pitching that could keep us in the ball games. And once we got healthy that things would change.\n\n\"We're here because the boys never gave up.\"\n\nFollow Bob Nightengale on Twitter: @Bnightengale", "description": "They Nationals embarrassed the Astros in Game 2 and are now halfway home to the first World Series championship by D.C. team since 1924.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/24/USAT/c2a290fa-3f30-4b7f-836a-726899bb9c6c-USATSI_13558824.jpg?crop=3988,2243,x0,y132&width=3200&height=2134&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
