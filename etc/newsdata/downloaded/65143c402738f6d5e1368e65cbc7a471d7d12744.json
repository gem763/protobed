He has spent the past three seasons as a special assistant in the Cubs\u2019 front office, and has also worked as an analyst for ESPN and appeared on \u201cDancing With the Stars.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI always have greater comfort hiring for roles in which the person has done the role,\u201d Cubs president of baseball operations Theo Epstein told reporters in September. \u201cBut there are ways that can be overcome: belief, skills, personal attributes can all outweigh a lack of experience.\u201d\n\nRoss, Epstein said at the time, \u201cis a very attractive candidate, and he\u2019s going to be evaluated on the merits for what he can bring to the table as a major league manager given his skills, given his experiences, given his worldview, given what he knows about winning.\u201d\n\nAmong the other known candidates who interviewed for the Cubs job was Houston Astros bench coach Joe Espada, who twice traveled to Chicago during off-days of the 2019 postseason to interview. Joe Girardi, Gabe Kapler, Mark Loretta and Will Venable also reportedly received interviews.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Cubs decided to part ways with Maddon following the team\u2019s disappointing 2019 season, in which they failed to make the playoffs for the first time since 2014. Maddon has since been hired to manage the Los Angeles Angels.\n\nThe reported hiring of Ross fits into a recent industry trend of hiring young and personable but inexperienced managers from outside the normal channels of minor-league managing and major league coaching. Among the successful hirings in recent years are the Astros\u2019 A.J. Hinch, the Los Angeles Dodgers\u2019 Dave Roberts and the Red Sox\u2019s Alex Cora. Among the failures are Kapler, who was fired by the Phillies after two rocky seasons on the bench.\n\nRead more baseball coverage:\n\nAD", "description": "Ross, 42, has no previous managing or coaching experience, but was considered a strong leader during a 15-year playing career that culminated with World Series championships in Boston (2013) and Chicago (2016).", "authors": ["Dave Sheinin", "National Baseball Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/YHOjw2AiksfPrdsdjlws_LOv0k4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GIT36SXHAYI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
