Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, during a press conference on Wednesday. \u00a9 Erin Schaff/The New York Times\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 House Democrats moved on Wednesday to compel the White House to cooperate in their impeachment inquiry, announcing plans to issue a subpoena by Friday if it did not comply with requests for documents related to President Trump\u2019s efforts to press Ukraine to investigate a leading political rival, and any attempt to conceal his actions.\n\nRepresentative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the chairman of the Oversight and Reform Committee, notified his panel of the impending subpoena on Wednesday. He said the White House had thus far ignored voluntary requests he submitted with the House Intelligence and Foreign Affairs Committees.\n\n\u201cI do not take this step lightly,\u201d Mr. Cummings wrote. \u201cOver the past several weeks, the committees tried several times to obtain voluntary compliance with our requests for documents, but the White House has refused to engage with \u2014 or even respond to \u2014 the committees.\u201d\n\nSign Up For the Morning Briefing Newsletter\n\nThe subpoena threat was the latest sign that the House was pushing ahead quickly with an aggressive investigation that has taken shape in just over two weeks, after revelations about attempts by Mr. Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, to pressure Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and other Democrats. The allegations, detailed in a whistle-blower complaint, have escalated into an impeachment inquiry that threatens Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency and is plainly enraging him.\n\nOn Wednesday, the president lashed out at Democrats online and before television cameras, denouncing leading lawmakers as \u201cdishonest people\u201d who were trying to overturn an election they lost in 2016. He distorted not just the facts of the case, but the investigative steps they had taken.\n\nAnd in a bizarre late-afternoon scene, Democrats found their expectations almost comically dashed by a briefing with the State Department\u2019s internal watchdog that they had expected to contain new revelations that could build their case about Mr. Trump. Steven A. Linick, the department\u2019s inspector general, had made a mysterious, last-minute request to deliver documents related to Ukraine to Capitol Hill, setting off a frenzied round of speculation of yet another bombshell from inside the administration.\n\nVideo provided by Reuters\n\nInstead, House Democrats were left fuming after Mr. Linick handed over a packet of news clippings, timelines and interview notes that appeared to have been shared with the State Department by Mr. Giuliani, most related to the unsubstantiated corruption accusations about Mr. Biden and his son that were at the heart of the president\u2019s pressure campaign.\n\nStill, the impeachment inquiry is intensifying. Mr. Cummings\u2019s warning suggested that lawmakers and their staffs were working sequentially to collect the evidence they believe they need to corroborate the anonymous C.I.A. whistle-blower complaint that touched off the inquiry. First, they targeted the State Department, then Mr. Giuliani and now the White House.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi and Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, warned the administration that any attempt to stonewall the House\u2019s request or intimidate witnesses would be construed as obstruction worthy of impeachment itself.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not fooling around here,\u201d Mr. Schiff said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want this to drag on months and months and months, which would be the administration\u2019s strategy. So they just need to know even as they try to undermine our ability to find the facts around the president\u2019s effort to coerce a foreign leader to create dirt that he can use against a political opponent, that they will be strengthening the case on obstruction.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump, watching on television from the White House, responded on Twitter: \u201cThe Do Nothing Democrats should be focused on building up our Country, not wasting everyone\u2019s time and energy on BULLS**T, which is what they have been doing ever since I got overwhelmingly elected in 2016, 223-306.\u201d\n\nThen, in a red-faced harangue in the Oval Office with a visibly uncomfortable president of Finland sitting next to him, Mr. Trump declared Democrats \u201cguilty as hell\u201d of corrupting the 2016 election, Mr. Biden \u201ccorrupt\u201d and \u201cless smart now than he ever was,\u201d and the C.I.A. whistle-blower \u201ca spy in my opinion.\u201d\n\nHe saved his sharpest barbs for Mr. Schiff, who has taken the lead in the investigations. Mr. Trump called him \u201ca lowlife\u201d and \u201cshifty, dishonest guy.\u201d Referring to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the president said Mr. Schiff \u201ccouldn\u2019t carry his \u2018blank\u2019 strap,\u201d using the word \u201cblank\u201d instead of \u201cjock\u201d for the locker-room insult.\n\nAt a second appearance with the visiting President Sauli Niinisto of Finland not much later, Mr. Trump became increasingly angry while responding to questions about the impeachment investigation.\n\nHe went after Mr. Schiff anew, seizing on a New York Times report that the chairman had learned the outlines of the whistle-blower\u2019s complaint earlier than previously known. Mr. Trump said, falsely, that Mr. Schiff had \u201chelped write it.\u201d\n\nThe president was so agitated as he was pelted with questions that he repeatedly ordered reporters to query Mr. Niinisto instead. At the end, Mr. Trump turned his back on the Finnish president and stalked off the stage in the East Room without offering his guest the customary handshake.\n\nMr. Giuliani said in an interview that the Democrats were \u201ccoming after his two lawyers,\u201d him and Attorney General William P. Barr, with their push to investigate the Ukraine call. He said that he and Mr. Trump were considering filing a lawsuit against Mr. Schiff.\n\nThere was a sense of theatrics on Capitol Hill, too, around Mr. Linick\u2019s appearance.\n\nSome news reports before the briefing suggested that Mr. Linick planned to bring evidence that showed Mr. Pompeo or his deputies had been trying to retaliate against State Department officials who cooperated with Congress. On a private call with Democratic lawmakers before the briefing, Mr. Cummings advised his colleagues to \u201cstay tuned\u201d for potentially big news.\n\nNothing of the sort materialized. Instead, Democrats left frustrated, accusing Mr. Linick of all but wasting their time with a few dozen pages of conspiratorial documents about the Bidens and Ukraine.\n\nThe material came in an aged manila envelope that was addressed in elaborate script to Mr. Pompeo and listed \u201cThe White House\u201d as the return address. It contained several folders that appeared to have come from a Trump hotel and copies of interview notes bearing the address of Mr. Giuliani\u2019s New York office.\n\nDemocrats said afterward that Mr. Linick had told them he interviewed T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, Mr. Pompeo\u2019s counselor, about the material. Mr. Brechbuhl said Mr. Pompeo had told him the information \u201ccame over\u201d; Mr. Brechbuhl assumed it was from the White House.\n\nWalking out of the briefing with a copy of the files in hand, Representative Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland, called the material an \u201cirrelevant distraction from the matter at hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is very clear what it is,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cIt is a package of propaganda, misinformation and conspiracy theories. The real question is where did it come from and how did it end up in our laps?\u201d\n\nMr. Giuliani confirmed Wednesday that at least some of the material was his. He said he gave Mr. Pompeo Ukraine-related material in March, but indicated that the secretary of state did not do anything with it.\n\nMr. Linick said that he had handed the same material he gave to Congress to the F.B.I. in June, and Mr. Giuliani indicated that he believed material he shared with the State Department itself had also been put before the bureau.\n\nMr. Linick did not take questions publicly.\n\nThe draft subpoena circulated by Mr. Cummings suggests he is casting a wide net for potential records related to the Ukraine matter, and is all but certain to touch off a battle with a White House that has a long history of refusing to comply with congressional requests.\n\nIt explicitly asks for records that could indicate whether the White House or other administration officials took steps to conceal or destroy the records to prevent Congress or the public from learning what had happened. Among the documents requested are any recordings, transcripts, notes or other records related to a July phone call in which Mr. Trump pressed President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to conduct investigations that would bolster the American leader politically, or an earlier April call between the two men. It asks for a full list of White House staff members involved in or aware of the calls, any communications that refer to the July call and details about how the White House maintained records of the call.\n\nThe Justice Department on Wednesday agreed to preserve records of Mr. Trump\u2019s calls with foreign leaders.\n\nThe draft subpoena also directs the White House to hand over records of any calls with other foreign leaders referring to the topics Mr. Trump discussed with Mr. Zelensky; of meetings related to Ukraine; and of the decision to temporarily withhold $391 million in security aid from the country this summer at the time Mr. Trump was pressing Mr. Zelensky.\n\nAsked if he would cooperate, Mr. Trump said, \u201cI always cooperate.\u201d But he then instantly denounced the investigation as \u201cthe greatest hoax\u201d and made no mention of the fact that he and his administration have spent much of the year blocking House requests for documents and testimony that they deemed partisan.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Pompeo became one of the first Trump administration officials to push back officially on the House investigation, writing in a letter to Democratic chairmen that their demands for confidential interviews with diplomats with knowledge of the case was \u201can act of intimidation\u201d and would not be immediately met.\n\nBut instead of bringing it to a halt, Mr. Pompeo\u2019s actions seem only to have fueled the case. The Democrats said any attempt to block witnesses from speaking to Congress would be construed by them as witness intimidation. And at least two of the diplomats Mr. Pompeo objected to speaking had indicated to the House that they would appear for private depositions anyway. Mr. Schiff indicated on Wednesday, though, that three other scheduled depositions may not yet be assured.\n\nMaggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York, and Kenneth P.
