Raab said he and his staff have been \"in constant discussions\" with the U.S. government and embassy officials since the deadly traffic accident occurred over the summer.\n\n\"We have pressed strongly for a waiver of immunity, so that justice can be done in Harry's case,\" the British foreign secretary wrote. \"Whilst the U.S. government has steadfastly declined to give that waiver, that is not the end of the matter.\"\n\n\"The question remains when such immunity comes to an end, regardless of any waiver. We have looked at this very carefully, as I wanted to be confident in the position before conveying it to you,\" Raab continued. \"The U.K. government's position is that immunity, and therefore any question of waiver, is no longer relevant in Mrs. Sacoolas' case, because she has returned home. The U.S. have now informed us that they too consider that immunity is no longer pertinent.\"\n\nPHOTO: Floral tributes lay on the roadside near RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire, England, Oct. 10, 2019, at the spot where 19-year-old Harry Dunn was killed in a traffic collision on Aug. 27, 2019.

The teen was taken to a hospital in the nearby city of Oxford, where he died soon after, according to Northamptonshire Police.\n\nThe crash occurred less than a mile down the road from Royal Air Force Croughton, commonly known as RAF Croughton, which is a British military station that houses an intelligence-gathering base operated by the United States Air Force. Sacoolas, whose husband is a U.S. diplomat assigned to the United Kingdom, is believed to have been the one driving the car.\n\n(MORE: Parents of British teen killed in crash involving American diplomat's wife speak out)\n\nNorthamptonshire Police are treating Sacoolas as a suspect in the fatal crash investigation, although they have not officially named her.\n\nSacoolas fled the United Kingdom after apparently claiming diplomatic immunity, which protects diplomats and their family members from prosecution or lawsuits under the host nation's laws.\n\nPHOTO: A general view of RAF Croughton near Brackley, England, Oct. 7, 2019.
