They\u2019ve reunited some animals with their owners, while other pets wait for new homes.\n\nRescuers had been looking for specific dogs with known owners when they stumbled upon the trapped puppy.\n\nVolunteer Sean Irion sat with him for a few minutes, letting him lick dog food out of a can, to gain his trust. His ribs showed through his light brown fur.\n\n\u201cLook at that tail wagging!\u201d Mr Irion said to the dog, according to a video of the rescue. \u201cWe\u2019ve got you.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

He picked up the dog, silent and unmoving, and carried him out of the wreckage.\n\nMs Simmons\u2019s phone rang at around 9:30am that day with a plea for help. Her volunteers had found an anaemic dog \u2013 barely alive \u2013 and needed to fly him back to Florida immediately.\n\nShe called the pilot whose planes Big Dog Ranch had been chartering, and her volunteers prepared the puppy for the flight.\n\nThe dog had survived only on rain water that filled a hole in front of him after the hurricane, so rescuers gave him some fluids to stabilise him before the hour-long flight.\n\nWhen he arrived at Big Dog Ranch, Ms Simmons said, his muscles had wasted away from a month of immobility and his body weight had plummeted from about 20kg to 9kg.\n\nHis care now includes antibiotics, gradual feeding and physical therapy to help him regain his muscle tone. The road ahead of him is long, but Ms Simmons said her organisation expects the dog to make a full recovery.\n\nBig Dog Ranch plans to post the puppy\u2019s details on missing dog websites that will give his owners 30 days to claim him. If no one comes forward, Ms Simmons said, the organisation will put him up for adoption.\n\nAnother dog found alongside the rescued mix-breed had not been as lucky and was dead when rescuers arrived. To Ms Simmons, it\u2019s incredible that any dogs survived the disaster.\n\nThe recovering puppy, she said, is a sign to families displaced by the tragedy that \u201cthere\u2019s hope for rebuilding and a new beginning\u201d.\n\nRescuers have named him \u201cMiracle\u201d.\n\nWashington Post", "description": "A drone flew over the wreckage, using an infrared camera to try to identify heat \u2013 a sign of possible life hidden amid the rubble.
