And it shakes off any sort of clingy superficiality \u2026 that you didn\u2019t have time for anyway.\n\n\"One of the fears that maybe, as artists, we all share \u2014 because we have this public experience of being criticized not just for our work but as human beings \u2014 is when it gets to be too much, when you learn that your skin is not quite as thick as you need it to be, what is that gonna feel like? Well, now I know. I got the hardest kick. And it ain\u2019t the end.\u201d\n\nRENEE ZELLWEGER TRANSFORMS INTO JUDY GARLAND FOR NEW BIOPIC, FIRST TRAILER REVEALS\n\nThe star went on to address the 2014 controversy directly, explaining that the topic is still sensitive to her given what receiving plastic surgery would imply to others about her character.\n\n\u201cWell, because there\u2019s a value judgment that\u2019s placed on us. As if it somehow is a reflection of your character \u2014 whether you\u2019re a good person or a weak person or an authentic person,\u201d she explained.\n\nWhen her interviewer suggested that fans may have been concerned about her drastically changing her appearance after being out of the public eye for years, she noted that thought makes her \u201csad.\u201d\n\nRENEE ZELLWEGER MAKES TRIUMPHANT RETURN TO HOLLYWOOD AFTER SIX-YEAR HIATUS IN NETFLIX\u2019S 'WHAT/IF'\n\n\u201cAnd the implication that I somehow needed to change what was going on because it wasn\u2019t working,\u201d she told the outlet. \u201cThat makes me sad. I don\u2019t look at beauty in that way. And I don\u2019t think of myself in that way. I like my weird quirkiness, my off-kilter mix of things. It enables me to do what I do. I don\u2019t want to be something else. I got hired in my blue jeans and cowboy boots with my messy hair. I started working like that. I didn\u2019t have to change to work. So why was I suddenly trying to fit into some mold that didn\u2019t belong to me?\u201d\n\nIn her response to the \u201ckerfuffle\u201d to HuffPost in 2016, Zellweger denied having any work done on her face.\n\n\u201cNot that it\u2019s anyone\u2019s business, but I did not make a decision to alter my face and have surgery on my eyes. This fact is of no true import to anyone at all, but that the possibility alone was discussed among respected journalists and became a public conversation is a disconcerting illustration of news/entertainment confusion and society\u2019s fixation on physicality.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAs the Vulture article notes, the 50-year-old star\u2019s face looks more familiar these days as she prepares for her starring role as Garland.
