The headlights and grille have been redesigned, evoking the original Fit, but the rest of the shape is largely unchanged from the previous generation. Because the gas tank still resides under the front seats, the back row can be folded up to create lots of cargo room.\n\nThe 2020 Fit will get five trim levels: Basic, Home, Ness, Crosstar, and Luxe. The Crosstar version promotes an SUV-like vibe with water-repellent materials on the seats, soft padding on the instrument panel, and 16-inch aluminum wheels.\n\nHonda has yet detail engine options for the 2020 Fit, saying only that it will come standard with a gas motor, while a newly developed two-motor hybrid powertrain will be an option. No power or performance figures have been released.\n\nThe latest version of Honda's Sensing safety system will be standard on the 2020 Fit, incorporating a front-view camera and eight sonar sensors to mitigate collisions.\n\nThe big question on our minds is whether the new Fit will come to the US. As Car and Driver points out, sales of the current Fit are down 17 percent in the US this year, and Honda recently moved US-market Fit production to Japan to make room in one of its Mexican plants to build more HR-V crossovers. We've reached out to Honda to see if this Fit will come to stateside, and a Honda spokesperson told us it will have more details on the car in the U.S. \"in the near future.\"\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Whehter it'll come to the US is another story.", "authors": ["Brian Silvestro"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/yV39xUTjeqsczJgyWD.9ww--~B/aD03MjE7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/road_track_223/b84e95d7b4d3b17faa340c36c3b3bebe", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
