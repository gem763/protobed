Before she performed, the East Tennessee native sat down with The Tennessean\u2019s Country Mile podcast to chat about her 2019, which might as well be renamed The Year of Dolly Parton.\n\n\u201cIt has been a great year, but I\u2019ve had a lot of good years,\u201d Parton said. \u201cI\u2019m just grateful for all of it. Who knows when you\u2019re starting out how it\u2019s going to turn out.\u201d\n\nSince February, Parton has been honored by MusiCares and the Recording Academy. She\u2019s worked on multiple Netflix movies, a Hallmark Christmas movie and completed taping this week for her television special Nov. 26 on NBC, \u201cDolly Parton: 50 Years at The Grand Ole Opry.\u201d On Nov. 13, she\u2019ll co-host the CMA Awards with Carrie Underwood and Reba McEntire.\n\nMore music: Listen to previous Country Mile episodes\n\n\u201cI bet you we\u2019ll be trying to outdress each other. We\u2019ll have to get together and coordinate our outfits and make sure we clash with our colors. I\u2019m going to be Dolly \u2013 whatever that does,\" she said.\n\nParton also talked about her plans for the holidays, the Grand Ole Opry, her future and more.\n\nThat means more songs, more stories and possibly some turkey cookies at Thanksgiving.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2019/10/17/dolly-parton-grand-ole-opy-country-mile-podcast/4007329002/", "description": "Country Mile episode 4 features Dolly Parton reflecting on everything from the CMA Awards to Thanksgiving dinner.", "authors": ["Cindy Watts", "Published A.M.
