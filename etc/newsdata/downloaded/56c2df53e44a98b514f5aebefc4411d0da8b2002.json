Its termination is an unavoidable choice for the South Korean government. Japan brought this on itself.\n\nRecently, South Korea\u2019s Supreme Court ordered Japanese firms to compensate its victims of forced labor during wartime. Japan was outraged. Last July, Tokyo moved to tighten controls on three semi-conductor materials exports to South Korea. The Japanese government failed to admit and apologize for the atrocities done by its troops, i.e. the invasion and annexation of the Korean peninsula, exploitations, women drafted for \u2018Japanese Military Sexual Slavery,\u2019 or forced labor. Japan, to the contrary, imposed tough economic sanctions.\n\nIn short, Japan, as the perpetrator, is rubbing salt in the wound of Koreans who still have pain from Japan\u2019s colonial occupation. This is why Koreans have reacted furiously.\n\nAlso, last June, Japan urged the world to support fair, indiscriminate and transparent trade at the G20 summit in Osaka. But just three days later Japan took measures to reverse this without prior notice or discussion, which was not consistent.\n\nAnd on August 2, Japan officially approved ejecting South Korea from its white list of countries, citing \u201csecurity concerns\u201d as the ostensible reason. However, the Japanese government declared through \u201cthe 2019 Report on Unfair Trade,\u201d announced last June, that \u201ccontrols on exports would hinder free trade and investment for security concerns.\u201d Nonetheless, it is tightening controls on exports by citing security concerns for the South Korea. Japan is full of contradictions.\n\nBreaking the trust and amicable relations with South Korea and then demanding \u201cexchange of sensitive military information for security at higher levels,\u201d especially while raising security concerns, is also self-contradictory.\n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that the Japanese government has not responded to Seoul\u2019s diplomatic efforts since its announcement in early July of tightened export regulations. Meanwhile, the South Korean government made diplomatic efforts to the Japanese government in many ways, i.e. sending special envoys twice including the G20 summit and acceptance of a \u201cstandstill agreement\u201c proposed by the United States.\n\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in said on August 15, South Korea\u2019s Independence Day, that \u201cIf Japan now desires dialogue and cooperation, then South Korea will be pleased to go with and work with it.\u201d But no matter how much effort had been made, Japan was simply non-responsive. I doubt whether Japan, together with the United States, is a real allied nation which supports endeavors to bring peace and security to the North-East Asia. And as a result, GSOMIA has been terminated.\n\nTo South Koreans, Japan is \u201cclose yet distant country\u201d.\n\nIn the ancient past, people living in the Korean peninsula spread all products of civilization including letters to Japan, an island country. However, Japan invaded and looted the Korean peninsula for thousands of years. Most recently, the Korean peninsula was annexed as a colony of Japan. So many Korean women drafted for Japanese military sexual slavery during wartime are now meeting their deaths without Japan\u2019s sincere apology.\n\nMany Korean men and women taken to Japan and all over the world for forced labor are also dying miserably without a word of apology and contrition from Japan. Japan continues to deny their existence. What South Koreans want is Japan to sincerely admit and apologize for its atrocities, just like Germany did for the affected countries and victims due to the Nazis.\n\nNow we hope for Japan to return to a U.S.-led international trade order, and as a global supply chain driver. That path will only allow Japan, South Korea, and the world economy to end uncertainty, build economic growth and relieve the people\u2019s suffering.\n\nLast but not least, I should like to offer a few words for the U.S. government. The role of the United States is needed more than ever not to repeat the history of the unfortunate wars that occurred in the Asia-Pacific nations including Northeast Asia. For any country, it starts with facing the historical facts. Those who distort or deny history are doomed to repeat the same past mistakes.\n\n\u2022 Lim Jong Seong is a Member of the National Assembly of Republic of Korea.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
