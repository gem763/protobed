REUTERS/Michaela Rehle\n\nThe Illinois-based machinery maker, famous for its black and yellow diggers and earthmovers, also said the impact on its business from Beijing and Washington\u2019s tit-for-tat trade tariffs would now be lower than previously forecast.\n\nHowever, it said that cuts in the inventory carried by the network of retailers who sell its products would accelerate further in the fourth quarter and see continued \u201cmoderate\u201d pricing for its range of goods next year.\n\nSales in Asia-Pacific, its third biggest market, fell 13% as it faced falling demand in China and competition from cut-price domestic rivals, while revenue in its main developed world market in North America fell almost 3%.\n\nThat drove an initial slide of 5% in the company\u2019s shares, now only marginally higher this year, and left analysts predicting little immediate improvement.\n\n\u201cWhile inventory reduction should set the company up for easier comparisons in 2020, trends in all three end markets continue to decelerate, raising the question of how far ahead the market is willing to discount the shares,\u201d said Jefferies analyst Stephen Volkmann.\n\nThe company\u2019s third-quarter profit for shareholders of $2.66 per share was well short of Wall Street estimates and the number for the same period a year ago - both set at $2.88 per share.\n\nCONSTRUCTION SLUMP\n\nCaterpillar said the slump in Asia was led by a 29% plunge in construction equipment sales and Chief Executive Officer Jim Umpleby said he expected overall demand in the fourth quarter to be flat.\n\nTotal sales and revenue for the third quarter ended Sept. 30 fell 5.6% from a year earlier to $12.76 billion.\n\n\u201cSales in Asia/Pacific were lower across most of the region primarily due to lower demand in China, including unfavorable changes in dealer inventories, amid continued competitive pressures,\u201d the company said.\n\nCaterpillar sales have improved since the company managed to halt a four-year slide in 2016, but Wall Street analysts have been warning that demand in more than half of its end markets had peaked.\n\nFinance chief Andrew Bonfie said dealers had reduced the value of stock they were holding by $400 million in the third quarter and were likely to cut by another $900 million in the final three months of the year, a stark contrast to an $800 million ramp-up in the third quarter a year ago.\n\nThe company is seen as one of Wall Street\u2019s clearer gauges of the state of Chinese demand and its impact on big western multinationals.\n\nCaterpillar said the impact of tariffs imposed on its goods as a result of President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with Beijing would now be lower than the $250 million to $350 million range it gave earlier this year.\n\nBut it also cut its 2019 expectations for profit to between $10.90 and $11.40 per share compared with a prior estimate of $12.06 to $13.06.\n\nProfit attributable to common stockholders fell to $1.49 billion in the third quarter from $1.73 billion, or $2.88 per share, a year earlier.", "description": "Industrial bellwether Caterpillar Inc reported a drop in sales in the United States and China in the third quarter, leading it to cut its outlook for the year and adding to evidence that the global economy is firmly on the decline.", "authors": ["Rachit Vats", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444073945&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M0UU", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
