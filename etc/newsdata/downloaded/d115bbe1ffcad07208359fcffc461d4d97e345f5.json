These appeared to suggest that Boeing had long been aware of problems with the aircraft\u2019s anti-stall system, known as the manoeuvring characteristics augmentation system, or MCAS.\n\nHowever, Boeing has argued that these texts had been handed over to the US Department of Justice after the first crash in October 2017 and were not about problems with the software, but with the simulator.\n\nNevertheless, the head of the Federal Aviation Administration last week publicly reprimanded Boeing over its failure to disclose the texts to the regulator until recently. The strained relationship between Boeing and the FAA has raised concerns that the timetable for re-certifying the 737 MAX could now be delayed into next year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nS &P this week revised its outlook on Boeing from stable to negative, but retained its A credit rating. It cited the texts and concern that the aircraft\u2019s return to service could be delayed. It also said the events of recent days could \u201chave a lasting impact on the company\u2019s reputation, competitive position, profitability, and \u2014 ultimately \u2014 its financial strength\u201d.\n\nBoeing this week put out a progress report of all the steps it is taking to address the problems of the 737. It said that all the upgrades to MCAS had been completed and handed to the FAA.\n\n\u201cThe company continues to work with the FAA and other global regulators on the process laid out for certifying the 737 MAX software and related training updates,\u201d it said. \u201cThe company has also made significant governance and operational changes to further sharpen its focus.\u201d\n\nMr Muilenberg is due to appear before Congress for two days next week. It will the first time lawmakers have a chance to grill Boeing directly about the circumstance that led to the crashes.\n\nFinancial Times", "description": "Boeing has replaced the head of its commercial aeroplanes division, marking the most significant leadership change in the wake of two deadly 737 MAX crashes.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4162%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_133/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/153aa0c9be005f5b72fefe5e53a86b05f9b75dbe", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
