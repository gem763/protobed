Open Phil, now independent, uses grants and catalytic investments to take risky bets, such as the $17.5 million grant it made earlier this year to Sherlock Diagnostics, which is creating an inexpensive viral diagnostic tool that could reduce the threat of a pandemic.\n\nTuna, 33, the project\u2019s president, shares her thoughts on their approach to funding basic science in global health, one of their main causes.\n\nHow do you select causes?\n\nChoosing which causes to work on is the most important decision a philanthropist makes. That choice plays a huge role in how much good the money can do. We looked at dozens of causes...and we chose our focus areas [U.S. policy, global catastrophic risks, and scientific research] based on three criteria: importance, neglectedness, and tractability.\n\nImportance means how many people an issue affects and how deeply it affects them. Neglectedness means how many other funders are working on the issue. And tractability means whether we can see a clear path to progress; whether there\u2019s any low-hanging fruit. Open Phil published a lot of this analysis on its website, in the hope of helping other donors hit the ground running more quickly than we did.\n\nWhat drew you to fund basic science in infectious disease, pathogen detection and identification, and countermeasures?\n\nBasic science is an area where philanthropy has a superstrong track record. When we were getting started, we went looking for historical examples of philanthropy changing the world. A couple of examples that really stood out were the development of the birth control pill and the Green Revolution, which massively increased agricultural productivity in the developing world. Those are remarkable success stories, and looking for more opportunities like them is part of what motivates our interest in science.\n\nOne way that philanthropy can have outsize impact is by focusing on global catastrophic risks. By that I mean low-likelihood events that could be hugely harmful to human well-being on a global scale, which often are neglected by other funders. Global pandemics represent an especially important and neglected risk. We\u2019ve been investing both in policy work and science to promote early detection and effective responses.\n\nWhat are you most proud of or excited about in terms of the scientific research you\u2019ve funded?\n\nOne of the lessons we learned from studying the history of philanthropy is that basic research can open up whole new areas of science, but it takes a long time to pay off. Philanthropists are well positioned, compared with other actors in society, to invest in work where the benefits are uncertain and far in the future. We\u2019re not looking for, or expecting, quick wins. We\u2019re trying to play the long game, and we\u2019re willing to take risks on things that might not pan out.\n\nRight now, we\u2019re very excited about the Institute for Protein Design\u2019s work on a universal flu vaccine, which just got a big prize from TED\u2019s Audacious Project, and Target Malaria\u2019s progress in its mosquito gene-drive research. If either of these projects succeed, it would do so much good for so many people around the world. We\u2019re proud to have bet on them early.", "description": "How the organization supports health research around the world", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-99969/social", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
