Analysts were looking for $63 billion. In the same period a year ago, the company posted revenue of $62.9 billion.\n\n$64 billion. Analysts were looking for $63 billion.

In its fourth quarter last year, Apple earned $2.91 a share.\n\n: $3.03. Wall Street was expecting $2.84. In its fourth quarter last year, Apple earned $2.91 a share.

Analysts were expecting $86.51 billion. Apple saw sales of $84.3 billion in the first quarter of 2019. Q1 earnings per share: Apple didn't provide a per-share earnings forecast, but the guidance it did provide implies it expects a first-quarter per-share profit of between $4.15 a share and $4.63 a share, assuming its share count remains about the same. The midpoint of that range is $4.39 a share, which is slightly below analysts' estimates of $4.42 a share.\n\nThe smallest iPhone decline since 2018\n\nThe brunt of iPhone sales in the quarter, which ended on September 28, were based on Apple's older line-up of phones. And Apple's iPhone revenue fell again in the fourth quarter of 2019, dropping by 9% year-over-year to $33.36 billion. Still, it was the first time that the year-on-year rate of decline has narrowed into single digits since since the end of 2018, when the iPhone business first began to shrink.\n\nAs the smartphone market has become saturated and various companies have grappled with declining sales, Apple has increased its focus on growing other product areas, particularly services. Over the past several months, Apple has expanded into new categories by launching subscription programs for gaming and premium television, as well as its own credit card called the Apple Card.\n\nThe services division grew to $12.5 billion, an increase from $10.5 billion in the same quarter last year, and now accounts for roughly 20% of Apple's total revenue. Tim Cook said the company is on track to meet its goal next year of doubling the 2016 services revenue.\n\nBusiness Insider Intelligence\n\nWearables are growing faster than any other Apple business\n\nApple's Wearables, Home, and Accessories business grew more than 50% year-over-year to $6.5 billion.\n\nThe group accounts for more revenue than Apple's iPad business, and is closing in on the Mac division, which earned the company $6.9 billion in revenue during the fiscal fourth quarter. Earlier this year, CEO Tim Cook said the wearables division alone is as big as a Fortune 200 company.\n\nCook declined to break out specific details about the performance of the various products within the wearables group, such as the Apple Watch and the AirPods.\n\nBut he noted that three out of four consumers who buy an Apple Watch are doing so for the first time, suggesting that the business is still expanding with new users rather than simply benefiting from die-hard Apple fans upgrading their devices.\n\n\"We're still significantly in the build mode,\" Cook said of the Watch business. \"We dont' think of the penetration as anywhere near a mature penetration.\"\n\nMany of Apple's services, however, are driven by the iPhone \u2014 and as such the iPhone remains an important tenant of Apple's business. The company expects the iPhone to return to growth in 2020 following the launch of four new iPhones, including three models that support 5G and one cheaper variant, Bloomberg reported earlier on Wednesday. Analysts also believe the introduction of 5G will be drive upgrades following next year's expected iPhone launch.", "description": "Apple's fiscal Q4 2019 earnings will provide an early look at how the iPhone 11, 11 Pro, and 11 Max are selling.", "authors": ["Lisa Eadicicco"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db9c1c4dee01910c70a3766?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
