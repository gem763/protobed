REUTERS/Leah Millis\n\nThe Democratic-led House of Representatives Intelligence Committee released a declassified version of the report, which had triggered a raging controversy and prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to launch a formal impeachment inquiry into the Republican president. The report said Trump acted to advance his personal political interests, and that White House officials intervened to shift evidence to a separate system.\n\nAt a hearing before the committee after the release of the document, the top U.S. intelligence official said the whistleblower had acted in good faith and followed the law in bringing the complaint.\n\nTrump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate the 2020 Democratic presidential front-runner, former Vice President Joe Biden, in coordination with U.S. Attorney General William Barr and Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, according to a summary of a July telephone call released by the Trump administration on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI am deeply concerned that the actions described below constitute \u2018a serious or flagrant problem, abuse, or violation of law or executive order\u2019 that \u2018does not include differences of opinion concerning public policy matters,\u2019 consistent with the definition of an \u2018urgent concern\u2019,\u201d the whistleblower report said.\n\nThe identity of the whistleblower has not yet been made public. In the report, the whistleblower said that \u201cI was not a direct witness to most of the events described.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s concerns did not end with Trump\u2019s conversation with Zelenskiy. The next day, the whistleblower report said, Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations Kurt Volker and Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland met with Zelenskiy and other Ukrainian political figures and advised them \u201cabout how to \u2018navigate\u2019 the demands that the president had made of Mr Zelenskiy.\u201d\n\nActing Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified to the committee just after the report was made public. Despite comments by Trump and other Republicans, Maguire said there was no reason to believe the whistleblower was disloyal to the United States or a political hack.\n\n\u201cI believe the whistleblower and the inspector general have acted in good faith throughout,\u201d he said, also referring to intelligence community Inspector General Michael Atkinson, who determined that the whistleblower allegations appeared credible and were of urgent concern.\n\n\u201cI think the whistleblower did the right thing. I think he followed the law every step of the way,\u201d Maguire said.\n\nMaguire added that he did not think it was \u201cappropriate\u201d to publicly rebuke Trump\u2019s public attacks on the individual.\n\nMaguire testified about the document after refusing for weeks to share the report with Congress. Committee Democrats said federal law had required that the report be given to Congress.\n\n\u201cI have upheld my responsibility to follow the law every step of the way in the matter that is before us today,\u201d Maguire told the committee. Under questioning, he acknowledged that this was the first time a whistleblower complaint was not shared with Congress.\n\nMaguire said he had not immediately released the report out of concern for \u201cexecutive privilege,\u201d a legal doctrine protecting certain executive branch communications.\n\n\u2018THIS MATTER IS UNPRECEDENTED\u2019\n\n\u201cI am not familiar with any prior instances where a whistleblower complaint touched on such complicated and sensitive issues including executive privilege. I believe that this matter is unprecedented,\u201d Maguire said.\n\nMaguire said he did not know who the whistleblower was and that he would work to ensure the individual\u2019s anonymity is protected.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint concerns a July 25 telephone call in which Trump pressed Zelenskiy to investigate Biden and his son Hunter, who had worked for a company drilling for gas in Ukraine.\n\nAdam Schiff, the Democratic committee chairman, grilled Maguire about why the whistleblower report was withheld. Trump, Schiff said, \u201chas betrayed his oath of office, betrayed his oath to defend our national security and betrayed his oath to defend the Constitution.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Devin Nunes, a close Trump ally who is the committee\u2019s top Republican, blasted Democrats for pursuing the matter, as well as media reports about the call and whistleblower report.\n\n\u201cI want to congratulate the Democrats on their latest information warfare effort against the president,\u201d Nunes said sarcastically.\n\nSaying more than six White House officials had made contact about Trump\u2019s communication with Ukraine, the report cited concerns that efforts to put pressure on Ukraine \u201cpose risks to U.S. national security,\u201d undermining efforts \u201cto deter and counter foreign interference in U.S. elections.\u201d\n\nTrump has denied wrongdoing and accused Democrats of trying to destroy him politically.\n\nThe whistleblower report also said, citing multiple U.S. officials, that senior White House officials had intervened to \u201clock down\u201d records of the call, especially the exact transcript.\n\n\u201cInstead the transcript was loaded into a separate electronic system that is otherwise used to store and handle classified information of an especially sensitive nature,\u201d the report said. \u201cOne White House official described this act as an abuse of this electronic system because the call did not contain anything remotely sensitive from a national security perspective.\u201d\n\nA federal law required that the report be sent to lawmakers after an inspector general deemed it was urgent and credible.\n\nMaguire said the greatest challenge facing the U.S. intelligence community is protecting the integrity of elections, federal, state and local.\n\nTrump denounced the report. \u201cTHE DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO DESTROY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND ALL THAT IT STANDS FOR,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201cSTICK TOGETHER, PLAY THEIR GAME, AND FIGHT HARD REPUBLICANS. OUR COUNTRY IS AT STAKE!\u201d\n\nUnder the U.S. Constitution, the House has the power to impeach a president for \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanours.\u201d No president has ever been removed from office through impeachment. Democrats control the House and Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans control the Senate.\n\nSlideshow (12 Images)\n\nThe United States has been giving military aid to Ukraine since Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014. The $391.5 million in aid at issue in the current controversy was approved by Congress to help Ukraine deal with an insurgency by Russian-backed separatists in the eastern part of the country.\n\nThe details of the July 25 call drew furious reactions from Democrats, who accused Trump of soliciting Ukraine\u2019s help to smear Biden, who has led in polls among Democratic candidates seeking to challenge the Republican president in the November 2020 election.\n\nThe call occurred after Trump had ordered a freeze of the military aid. The whistleblower report said that an official from the White House informed departments and agencies on July 18 that Trump had issued instructions to suspend all security assistance to Ukraine. Neither the White House budget office of the National Security Council staff \u201cknew why this instruction had been issued,\u201d the report said.", "description": "A whistleblower report released on Thursday said President Donald Trump not only abused his office in attempting to solicit Ukraine's interference in the 2020 U.S. election for his own political benefit, but that the White House also tried to \"lock down\" evidence about that conduct.", "authors": ["Patricia Zengerle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434192480&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P1A7", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
