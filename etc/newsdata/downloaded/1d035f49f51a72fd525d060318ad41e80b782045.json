(Photo: Facebook/Laura Snyder)\n\nA fourth-grade Florida student who was bullied for his homemade orange University of Tennessee shirt is inspiring others to stand up to bullying. On Thursday, a school in Pennsylvania saw a \"sea of orange\" as nearly 900 students wore brightly-hued shirts to protest bullying.\n\nLast week, Laura Snyder, an elementary school teacher, shared on Facebook that one of her students wore a homemade Tennessee Volunteers shirt (representing the football team at the University of Tennessee) for his school's \u201ccollege colors day.\u201d The boy had pinned a hand-drawn \"U of T\" logo on the front. According to Snyder, the student was excited to represent the team, but some of his peers mocked the homemade creation. The incident left him in tears.\n\nThe story made national news and resulted in the University of Tennessee using the student's design on an official t-shirt and donating proceeds to STOMP Out Bullying. And, should the boy eventually meet admission requirements, they have offered him a four-year scholarship covering tuition and fees starting in 2028.\n\nThe university's response is what touched Principal Chad Runkle and Assistant Principal Mike Azzalina of Winding Creek Elementary School in Mechanicsburg, Penn., according to Knoxville News.\n\n\"What a gracious, awesome stance,\" Runkle reportedly said. \"A big, giant university that didn't have to do anything about it other than maybe they could have sent him a T-shirt or something \u2014 they went above and beyond.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, after Runkle shared the young boy's story with the school, Azzalina asked the student body to wear orange on Thursday's spirit day, even if that meant a homemade shirt.\n\nAccording to Runkle, watching 900 students exit the school buses that morning was like seeing a \"sea of orange.\"\n\nWinding Creek stands with The University of Tennessee @UTKnoxville today as we proudly wore orange in support of the anti-bullying story they championed. Hundreds of our kids came in a wave of orange as we spread the hope for school environments built on kindness. @CVSDnews pic.twitter.com/pXTkjL0k8x \u2014 Winding Creek Elementary School (@WC_WolfPack) September 12, 2019\n\n\"I have never seen a spirit day (like this). I bet 95% of our kids were in orange in some way, shape or form,\" he said, according to Knoxville News.\n\n\"I got teary-eyed, to be honest with you,\" Runkle reportedly said. \"This really resonated with our kids.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Winding Creek Elementary School did not immediately respond to Yahoo Lifestyle\u2019s requests for comment.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "On Thursday, a principal at an elementary school in Pennsylvania, estimates that at least 95 percent of students wore orange in an effort to stand up to bullying.", "authors": ["Hope Schreiber"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/uuRMFL3CQdZE0mye5hw6Jg--~B/aD05MDA7dz0xNTg4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/51780a90-d675-11e9-be1f-e891a73fce11", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
