The Wall Street Journal previously reported WeWork has had discussions with SoftBank about an investment that would allow the company to go public in 2020.\n\nThe discussions about how to proceed follow the realization that public markets will initially value We at a much lower valuation than the company's last private financing round. Sources told CNBC on Thursday that the company likely won't be able to garner a valuation of $25 billion from an IPO. That's at least $22 billion less than WeWork's $47 billion private valuation.\n\nThere are many factors at play here, making a decision to charge ahead or delay complicated. SoftBank and its associated Vision Fund are the company's largest independent holders, with about 114 million Class A shares. SoftBank Group Corp. and its affiliates own about 29% of WeWork in total, Bloomberg reported Thursday. SoftBank has invested about $10 billion in WeWork, including a most recent $1 billion investment that valued the company at $47 billion.\n\nGoing public at a significantly lower valuation than $47 billion won't be good optics for SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, who is trying to raise money for Vision Fund 2. SoftBank is already underwater with its $7.6 billion investment in Uber, arguably the tech industry's biggest blunder of an IPO before the upcoming WeWork debut (if it happens).\n\nIt would also be bad for WeWork employee morale if even a $20 billion or $25 billion IPO immediately slumps, similar to Uber or Slack, another late-stage Vision Fund investment. Gauging the floor \u2014 just how low WeWork may trade \u2014 is part of the job of financial advisors, which in this case include J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America.\n\nThen again, CEO Adam Neumann, the largest holder of WeWork stock, may want to increase his liquidity options now if he feels WeWork's chances of flourishing are only going to get worse. Neumann has already sold more than $700 million of stock and debt ahead of the company's IPO, according to the Journal.", "description": "Going public at a significantly lower valuation than $47 billion is bad optics for SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, and bad for employee morale.", "authors": ["Alex Sherman"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106116477-1567787619340gettyimages-1138452137.jpg?v=1567787728", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
