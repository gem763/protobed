(Andrew Harnik)\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Stephen Strasburg wanted the ball. That\u2019s what he told Manager Dave Martinez when he arrived at Dodger Stadium on Thursday, just two days after he threw 34 pitches in relief, and just hours before the Washington Nationals were set to begin a best-of-five series against the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\n\u201cI mean it is something I haven\u2019t done in a really long time, and it is what it is,\u201d Strasburg said of altering his rigid routine to be ready for a start after the first relief appearance of his career Tuesday in the National League wild-card game. \u201cSo just try to focus on what you can control and just disregard everything that you can\u2019t.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of the nature of the business. Sometimes you\u2019re going to have to deal with some things that you wouldn\u2019t expect, and bottom line is you still have to go out there and compete.\u201d\n\n['There's something about this team': These playoffs have different feel for Nats fans]\n\nHe soon will compete against the Dodgers and left-hander Clayton Kershaw. That\u2019s the matchup for Friday, and the stakes will shift depending on which team wins Thursday night\u2019s series opener. Strasburg (18-6, 3.32 ERA) has been Washington\u2019s most consistent pitcher this season. He helped steady the rotation when Max Scherzer missed six weeks with various injuries this summer. He made 33 starts, his most since 2014, and many lobbied for him to start the wild-card game in place of Scherzer.\n\nBut Strasburg instead came out of the bullpen to toss three scoreless innings. That came after Scherzer gave up three runs on two homers in the first five innings. That made it possible he could still go in Game 2, having thrown only those 34 pitches in the past nine days, and that\u2019s what the club decided on. This schedule also means Strasburg could be lined up for a potential Game 5 should it be necessary. Martinez admitted that factored heavily into his calculations.\n\n\u201cIn my mind I like the way that sets up, yeah. It had a lot to do with it,\u201d Martinez said Thursday afternoon. \u201cThe biggest thing was I wanted him to come to me and I wanted him to own it. I wasn\u2019t going to pressure him into doing anything because he\u2019s done a lot for us already. We wouldn\u2019t be here right now. He was a big reason why we are here.\u201d\n\nMartinez added that Strasburg won\u2019t be on any restrictions Friday. The Nationals are pitching him because he feels like he can shoulder a regular workload at 100 percent. He threw 100 or more pitches in 22 of his starts. The postseason is a different beast, and starters don\u2019t usually make it that deep into games, but the point is that he is ready to be unleashed.\n\nThe Nationals have not yet decided on a Game 3 starter but Scherzer is the likely choice. The Dodgers have tabbed Hyun-jin Ryu for that contest in Washington on Sunday night. That would line up An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez for Game 4, and if the series is even, both Strasburg and Game 1 starter Patrick Corbin should be ready for the do-or-die finale. Martinez has given himself as many options as possible by bumping Strasburg up. And that\u2019s all he could ask for at this time of year.\n\n\u201cFor me it\u2019s like he threw a side of 34 pitches with intensity,\u201d Martinez said of Strasburg. \u201cThat\u2019s the way I looked at it the other day. So he says he feels really good, so he\u2019s ready to go.\u201d\n\nLINEUPS\n\nNationals\n\nTrea Turner SS\n\nAdam Eaton RF\n\nAnthony Rendon 3B\n\nJuan Soto LF\n\nHowie Kendrick 1B\n\nAsdr\u00fabal Cabrera 2B\n\nVictor Robles CF\n\nYan Gomes C\n\nPatrick Corbin P\n\nDodgers\n\nA.J.
