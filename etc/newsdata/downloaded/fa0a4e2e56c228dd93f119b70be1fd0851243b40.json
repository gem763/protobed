But many expect a snap vote to be called in late November, at the earliest, because of the Brexit uncertainty, and both sides in the political stand-off are already in full campaign mode across social media.\n\nAnalysis by POLITICO shows they have collectively spent roughly \u00a31 million since mid-June on partisan Facebook ads aimed at wooing voters through tailored messages about Brexit, immigration and other hot-button topics.\n\nThis phony war highlights how reliant the country\u2019s political parties have become on Facebook, Twitter and Google to sway an electorate deeply divided over the U.K.\u2019s relationship with the European Union.\n\nIt also heightens concerns that groups, both domestic actors and potentially those backed by foreign governments, may misuse such digital information when targeting voters after the British parliament failed to pass new rules to police online campaigning before it was suspended last week.\n\nSecurity officials are already raising the alarm within the halls of power that Russian-backed groups may seek to sow dissent.\n\nThe country's major parties also have been actively harvesting people\u2019s personal data \u2014 through Facebook ads, online polls and digital surveys \u2014 to create complex databases of voter intentions and gain an advantage over their rivals.\n\n\u201cThe political campaign has begun,\u201d said Martin Moore, director of the Centre for the Study of Media, Communication and Power at King\u2019s College London. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt it will be a data-driven campaign where people will be targeted very hard with messages around Brexit.\u201d\n\nBritish regulators, including the country\u2019s privacy agency and Electoral Commission, say the rules overseeing national elections have not kept up with 21st century digital campaigning. Groups can easily sidestep caps on political spending by relying on anonymous online activists to spend heavily across social media.\n\nLocal lawmakers also warn that foreign interference \u2014 either through direct political messaging on social media, or through funding for U.K.-based groups posting online \u2014 may sway the outcome of the upcoming election because of limited information on who\u2019s behind the digital activity.\n\nSecurity officials are already raising the alarm within the halls of power that Russian-backed groups may seek to sow dissent, as happened during the 2016 U.S. presidential election and last year\u2019s U.S. mid-terms.\n\nFacebook now requires individuals to pass a series of checks before buying political ads in the U.K., but roughly 40 percent of paid-for partisan content falls through that net, according to security analysts' estimates.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t have robust rules for transparency, voters won\u2019t know who\u2019s targeting them,\u201d said Damian Collins, a British MP who chairs the U.K. parliament\u2019s digital, culture, media and sport committee, which is carrying out a lengthy investigation into online disinformation. \u201cIt\u2019s a big concern. We should have emergency legislation to mandate transparency in political campaigns.\u201d\n\nOnline strategies\n\nThe digital election campaign began days after Boris Johnson became prime minister in late July.\n\nHis team started buying Facebook political ads targeting older voters, mostly in England, with a message of increased investment in health and education services, according to the social network\u2019s transparency register.\n\nThe Brexit Party is targeting mostly elderly voters in Brexit-leaning constituencies in both England and Wales.\n\nThe paid-for messages also asked people to tell Johnson what he should focus on as prime minister through an online form that required individuals to submit their email address and zipcode \u2014 vital details that could allow the Conservative Party to build a sophisticated online database of voters and their habits.\n\nSince Johnson took over, the party is estimated to have spent tens of thousands of pounds to gather as much data as they can, including information on people\u2019s financial transactions, family connections and their online activities, according to the party\u2019s privacy policy.\n\nSuch information allows political groups to use social media tools to create so-called \"lookalike\" online audiences by inputting people\u2019s email addresses into sites like Facebook, which then offer suggestions of other social media users who may have similar interests or political affiliations.\n\nLawmakers worldwide have been using such tactics for years. But privacy campaigners claim that few, if any, people who are targeted understand how their information was collected and shared with political groups.\n\nTeams behind Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour Party leader, and Nigel Farage, head of the Brexit Party, have similarly asked Facebook users to hand over their data through online polls and other tactics, according to an analysis of both lawmakers\u2019 social media political ads.\n\nUK NATIONAL PARLIAMENT ELECTION POLL OF POLLS\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats\u2019 digital survey openly admits the party will use people\u2019s digital information \"to further our objectives.\u201d\n\nPolitical groups are already using such insight into voter interests.\n\nWhen Johnson recently traveled to Wakefield in the north of England to give a press conference, the Labour Party bombarded locals on Facebook with ads criticizing the prime minister, according to a review of social media activity by WhoTargetsMe, a group that tracks political messaging on the site.\n\nThe Brexit Party, which has offered to work with Johnson ahead of the expected general election, is also targeting mostly elderly voters in Brexit-leaning constituencies in both England and Wales, hoping to drum up a groundswell of support for the potential alliance ahead of the nationwide vote.\n\nSuch tactics are not illegal, and build on age-old traditional political tactics like canvassing and leafleting by politicians across local constituencies.\n\nBut experts caution that the growing sophistication of so-called online micro-targeting on social media will likely make it difficult for voters to understand what potentially contradictory messages political groups are spreading online.\n\n\u201cMicro-targeting is a concern because it erodes common political discourse,\u201d said Katharine Dommett, director of the Crick Centre for the Public Understanding of Politics at the University of Sheffield. \"It allows politicians to run different campaigns aimed at different types of voters.\"\n\nThis article is from POLITICO Pro: POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service.
