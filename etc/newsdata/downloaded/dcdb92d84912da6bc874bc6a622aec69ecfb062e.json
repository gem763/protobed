Ron Johnson of Wisconsin said the block came shortly after a U.S. diplomat told him that nearly $400 million in aid was contingent on Ukraine investigating the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the Wall Street Journal reported. Johnson said he \u201cwinced\u201d when he heard from Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, that the aid was dependent on an investigation.\n\n\"My reaction was, 'Oh, God.
