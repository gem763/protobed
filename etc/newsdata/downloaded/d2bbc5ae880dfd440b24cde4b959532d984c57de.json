The pen and ink drawing Jeune Femme Assise (Young woman seated) carries the highest estimate in the sale, $150,000 to $200,000.\n\nThe 52cm by 40cm drawing is signed and dated 1942 and, importantly, is accompanied by a certificate of authenticity from the Matisse Archives.\n\nJeune Femme Assise by Henri Matisse is expected to fetch $150,000 to $200,000. Leski\n\nThe catalogue says a private collector in Connecticut bought it in 1959 from the Pierre Matisse Gallery in New York before it ended up in a private collection in Melbourne.\n\nAustralian Art Sales Digest records show it was bought by the present Sydney owner at Deutscher and Hackett in Melbourne in April 2008 for $132,000 and was reoffered, unsuccessfully, at Menzies in March 2012.\n\nThe Leski catalogue quotes a recognised expert on Matisse, the late Wanda de Guebriant of Paris, who was the archivist for the artist's estate, saying that the drawing relates to a painting entitled Monique. The title possibly refers to student nurse Monique Bourgeois, who nursed Matisse in the early 1940s as he recovered from cancer.\n\nThe Duchess of Devonshire as the Vestal Virgin by Angelica Kauffman has an estimate of $30,000 to $40,000. Leski\n\nA chair made by Josef Hoffmann for the Vienna apartment of gas mogul Moriz Gallia and his wife Hermine is the missing sixth seat in a setting now at the Museum of Victoria. The museum bought five of the austere early 20th century ebonised chairs in the 1970s and may be keen to buy the sixth chair for its extensive Hoffmann setting. The chair is estimated at $30,000 to $50,000.\n\nAmazingly, according to Leski\u2019s Harry Glenn, the chair was left on a kerb in Sydney\u2019s inner city, dismissed as rubbish by one auctioneer and was sold for $30 by another as African before its importance was recognised.", "description": "The missing sixth item in a museum's set has reappeared after 50 years.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2156%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_245/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ef548c5016363483df59da0c7d7106202fda38dc", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
