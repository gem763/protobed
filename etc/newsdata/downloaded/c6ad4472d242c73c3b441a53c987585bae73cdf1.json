They\u2019re keen on this because the first-year LSU passing game coordinator, the one whose hiring Coach Ed Orgeron last summer called \u201ca game-changer for us,\u201d is Joe Brady, the former Joey Brady, their former William & Mary teammate (2009-12) who just inched past 30 himself, who caught three passes for 34 yards in college, and who probably could recite the William & Mary playbook, probably backward, and probably sideways.\n\nFor eons, people have said that if run-minded LSU could diversify, look out.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLSU can diversify, and its national ranking in passing yards per game \u2014 116th in 2014, 106th in 2015, 101st in 2016, 84th in 2017 and 67th in 2018 \u2014 has leaped to second in 2019, as quarterback Joe Burrow is up from 52nd to third in passer rating and has thrown 22 touchdown passes, just six from tying the program\u2019s season record. All this entering Saturday\u2019s showdown in Baton Rouge between the No. 5 Tigers (5-0) and No. 7 Florida (6-0), so look out.\n\nOn Sept. 7, the night LSU visited Texas and bummed out its home fans with 471 passing yards and 45 points, a whoa went up at a gathering in Northern Virginia; a cheer went up at a bachelor party in, by chance, Austin; a former quarterback marveled in Scotch Plains, N.J.; the chat groups did percolate; and none of it related to anybody with LSU purple-and-gold in the veins.\n\nAll of it related to the moments Brady turned up on television screens.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn Northern Virginia, the watch group included former William & Mary defensive end Quincey September, cornerback Jesse McNeal III, tight end Evan McGill, safety Ivan Tagoe, linebacker Alex Goodman. \u201cThey just kept showing Joe Brady, and I was like, \u2018Whoa, this is wild,\u2019 \u201d said Airek Green, former William & Mary linebacker and party host.\n\nIn Austin, the bachelor party feted former tight end Nolan Kearney and included probably 12 former players. \u201cHis face shows up, we all started cheering,\u201d Kearney said.\n\nIn New Jersey, William & Mary\u2019s passing leader from Brady\u2019s senior year, Raphael Ortiz, sat in a sports bar with his fiancee and future brother-in-law and thought, \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe someone I played with could be coaching in the SEC at that level.\u201d He marvels that Professor Herbstreit of the ESPN faculty raved about Brady, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s definitely strange seeing his name and picture popping up on \u2018College GameDay,\u2019 and Kirk Herbstreit talking about him as having a major impact on the game. I just think it\u2019s wild.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe whole thing is wild because the whole thing has been rapid, a quick coaching rise through William & Mary, Penn State, the New Orleans Saints (who do not dawdle with the football), now LSU. It\u2019s also newly normal in these Sean McVay days of young honcho coaches, even if a fresh star of a coach hailing from William & Mary hardly rates as fresh news. Somehow, four universities have yielded two current NFL head coaches each \u2014 Miami of Ohio, Texas Tech, Michigan State \u2014 and, somehow, wee William & Mary, with Mike Tomlin in Pittsburgh and Sean McDermott in Buffalo.\n\n\u201cI just think the one thing not to be overlooked is this is not a surprise,\u201d Kearney said. \u201cAnd with the legacy of coaches from William & Mary\u201d \u2014 he listed Marv Levy, Lou Holtz and Dan Quinn, who coached there, and Tomlin and McDermott, who played there \u2014 \u201che\u2019s the next one. He\u2019s the next one up, in my opinion.\u201d\n\nOften in the eccentric annals of American-football coaching, there\u2019s a coach everyone saw coming before he began coaching. This does not appear to have been one of those stories. This appears to be one of those stories times 10.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOrtiz, Brady\u2019s senior-year quarterback, thinks the car was black, and he thinks it was a Nissan, but he definitely remembers the license plate: Florida, and BRADY IV. One could spot it outside William & Mary\u2019s Laycock Football Center at many an hour \u2014 maybe even 4 a.m. if one so chose \u2014 and could surmise that Brady, whom they addressed as \u201cBrady\u201d or even \u201cCoach Brady,\u201d might be in there gazing at the nuances of game film.\n\nIf you went Sunday morning, Monday morning, he\u2019d be there already.\n\n\u201cHe was there more, if not the same amount of time, as maintenance was,\u201d Green said.\n\nA coach? Yeah: \u201cI would always get advice from him academically, socially and about how to go about the game,\u201d Green said. And yeah: \u201cHe always sat in the front row of meetings, always helping out the younger guys,\u201d Ortiz said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe was so knowledgeable about blocking schemes, and what we were trying to accomplish in a play,\u201d Ortiz said, \u201cthat we would throw him in ahead of somebody who might athletically be more gifted.\u201d\n\nOrtiz found Brady an interesting case of the value of knowledge. \u201cYou can watch hours of film and not get anything out of it,\u201d Ortiz said. \u201cIt\u2019s just being a student of the game and understanding the whys of it.\u201d\n\nBrady and his fellow receiver, D.J. Mangas, might kill you at strategy-centric video games, Kearney said, and the latter has become both William & Mary\u2019s offensive coordinator and, as of last offseason, an LSU offensive analyst.\n\nBrady, a South Floridian to start off, had transferred into William & Mary after one season on the practice squad at Air Force. He would stay on after his playing days for two seasons as a graduate assistant on the William & Mary staff, helping out with linebackers, making him an emblem of the value of having coached on both sides of possession.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHis coaching of the linebackers, said the linebacker Green, often felt more like a conversation. He would ask, \u201cWhat do you look for when you\u2019re watching film?\u201d He would say, \u201cHey, I don\u2019t want to come in thinking I know everything, so if I say something that\u2019s off, step up and say it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was very upfront with it,\u201d Green said. \u201cWe all knew the situation. He was literally [just finished being] a player.\u201d\n\nAs he moved along briskly, he learned more under current Mississippi State Coach Joe Moorhead at Penn State when Moorhead coordinated the offense and oversaw the quarterbacks in the Nittany Lions\u2019 Big Ten-winning year of 2016. He reached the Saints and their renowned offensive laboratory. He impressed Orgeron with his precision and expertise when Orgeron had Saints coaches visit for a little teaching session.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe took the LSU job once veteran assistant Jerry Sullivan retired, generated the happy wintertime talk that can grace Southeastern college towns, and showed an engaging personality when he met with Louisiana reporters in summer.\n\nHe said, \u201cLook, the thing about LSU is they\u2019re always gonna have speed, and you know, and it\u2019s our job as coaches to put our speed in space and to allow them to win their one-on-one\u201d matchup, and, \u201cI\u2019m not an in-front-of-the-media-type person. I like to be kind of in my office \u2026\u201d\n\nNow he\u2019s in front of the media, causing little cheers around the land, and lighting up certain chat groups like the one with the 10 or 11 former William & Mary football players and the one javelin thrower (because every chat group can use a javelin thrower).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something we ever doubted,\u201d Kearney said, soon adding, \u201cI don\u2019t think this is shocking I think it\u2019s just how he is, and how he\u2019s always been.\u201d Still, it does light up a chat group.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Joe Brady, just turned 30, is the passing game coordinator behind perhaps the freshest wrinkle in college football this year: LSU can throw the ball as well as run it.", "authors": ["Chuck Culpepper", "Reporter Who Covers National College Football", "College Basketball", "Tennis", "Golf", "International Sports."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/3V-MN3IH0pLJEdpoZDrNV9_5FrU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TGQTIVHLVMI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
