Genk were unfortunate to have a Mbwana Samatta effort ruled out in the first half and spurned several other chances to equalise before Liverpool took charge.\n\nSuch are the standards that Klopp has now set, however, that he was not entirely impressed despite his side moving second in Group E with six points, one behind Napoli.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t enjoy the game too much but I enjoyed the result a lot,\u201d said Klopp, whose side\u2019s 17-match winning streak in the Premier League ended in a 1-1 draw at Manchester United on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had two away games that were both difficult for different reasons. I don\u2019t know where we are at the moment. I know where we have to be on Sunday (against Tottenham Hotspur).\n\n\u201cThere were good moments. We started well but lost a lot of easy balls, unexpected balls. Of course, those are the most difficult to defend against. Our first goal was brilliant \u2014 all four goals were brilliant.\u201d\n\nKlopp has an embarrassment of attacking riches with Oxlade-Chamberlain\u2019s return yet another option.\n\nHe struck a clinical opener after two minutes and his 57th-minute goal to double his side\u2019s lead, a nonchalant clipped effort with the outside of his right foot, was a gem.\n\nIt was Liverpool\u2019s 200th Champions League goal but even Oxlade-Chamberlain got a \u201ccan do better\u201d report.\n\n\u201cOx was like the game was. The goals were brilliant, but he can do much better and he knows that,\u201d the German said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s had a lot of time out and he lacked a bit of rhythm in some moments, but the goals were lovely. It was a big step.\u201d\n\nLiverpool have now won 25 of their last 30 matches in all competitions, and the way they made a potentially tricky night into a relatively smooth one was a sign of the confidence and winning mentality now ingrained in the squad.\n\n\u201cIn the years before we would have drawn it, maybe even lost, but it\u2019s all OK. It was intense, we needed concentration,\u201d Klopp added.", "description": "Liverpool produced a devastating attacking display to beat Racing Genk 4-1 in the Champions League on Wednesday but manager Juergen Klopp said he had not enjoyed it.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444276720&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M252", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
