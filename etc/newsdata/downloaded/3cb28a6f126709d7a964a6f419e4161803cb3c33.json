(PCG) are falling in Wednesday's after-hours session, after a judge opened the door to a rival's chapter 11 plan for the embattled company.\n\nPG&E is also dealing with the impact of having to cut power to around 800,000 businesses and households in California as it tries to reduce the threat of wildfires.\n\nAt 5:46 p.m. ET, shares of PG&E had lost 19.22%, to trade at $8.84. Volume in the late session topped 633,000 shares.\n\nThe company's shares had finished the day's regular trading session with a 0.73% gain, to close at $10.98.\n\nA bankruptcy judge in California stripped PG&E of the sole right to propose a chapter 11 plan, opening the way for a rival plan backed by bondholders of the utility, including Elliott Management.\n\n--Write to Stephen Nakrosis at stephen.nakrosis@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 09, 2019 18:04 ET (22:04 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
