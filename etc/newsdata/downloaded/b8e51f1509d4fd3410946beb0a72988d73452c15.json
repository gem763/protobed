Park said if that doesn\u2019t work out, the KFA would have to relay updates from the Asian Football Confederation or from the sport\u2019s world governing body, FIFA.\n\n\u201cWe have no idea how things will be at the stadium,\u201d Park said. North Korea has agreed to provide a recording of the match to South Korean officials before they leave the North, which would allow South Korean networks to play the game on tape delay, according to Seoul\u2019s Unification Ministry, which deals with affairs with the North.\n\nThe game would be the first competitive meeting between the national men\u2019s teams in the North Korean capital, although the North hosted the South for a friendly there in 1990.\n\nNorth Korea in recent months has severed virtually all cooperation with the South amid a standstill in nuclear negotiations with the United States, and repeatedly ignored the South\u2019s calls for discussions on media coverage issues and allowing South Korean cheer squads for Tuesday\u2019s game.\n\n\u201cThere was no response from the North, and we find this regrettable and sad,\u201d Lee Sang-min, spokesman of Seoul\u2019s Unification Ministry, said during a briefing on Monday.\n\nThe KFA anticipates that its two Group H matches against North Korea and the away game against Lebanon will be critical in the Asian qualifying campaign for the 2020 World Cup in Qatar. The second match between the Koreas is scheduled for June 4 next year in South Korea.\n\nSouth Korea has a stronger team on paper, led by the likes of Son Heung-min, a star for Tottenham in the English Premier League. But for Tuesday\u2019s game, North Korea will have unique home advantage with the 50,000 capacity Kim Il Sung Stadium expected to be full and entirely devoid of South Korean fans.\n\nGroup H also includes Lebanon, Turkmenistan, and Sri Lanka.\n\nDuring qualification for the 2010 World Cup, North Korea chose to host games against South Korea at a neutral venue in Shanghai, refusing to hoist the South Korean flag and play the South Korean anthem on its soil.\n\nThe fate of the game in Pyongyang was uncertain until last month when the soccer\u2019s Asian governing body informed the KFA that the North decided it would host the qualifier as scheduled.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The rival Koreas are set to meet in an historic soccer World Cup qualifier in Pyongyang, but the match has been cast into media darkness in the South, with the North disallowing South Korean reporters and spectators and refusing a live broadcast from Kim Il Sung Stadium.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kim Tong-Hyung"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/15/china_south_north_korea_soccer_36347_c0-146-3500-2187_s1200x700.jpg?50e117847fba66c2d01efa712c1454d317fcd0c6", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
