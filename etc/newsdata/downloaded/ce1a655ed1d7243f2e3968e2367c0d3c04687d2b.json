They may also feel closer to their partner and this results in a more positive approach to life or their partner.\u201d\n\n\n\nFindings associated with the body changing after sex include a process called vasocongestion, where the nipples become more sensitive as a result of arousal and strong emotions.\n\nThe breasts become temporarily firmer especially if the woman has had an orgasm during the intercourse, but it is the mood change which often lets others know that you've recently enjoyed some intimacy.\n\nREAD MORE: Saint Laurent's new condoms are the kind of luxury latex we wouldn't mind keeping a stash of in our handbags\n\nChrista adds that women are a bit more complex than men.
