They asked questions about the water they have been drinking for a lifetime only to be told that it may be contaminated with lead and other chemicals, and could have lasting impacts on the health of their children.\n\nAnd they learned that things may well be much worse than they have been told, even as city officials have sworn that the city\u2019s water system is nowhere near as dangerous as the one in Flint just a half decade ago.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

This is going to impact generations,\u201d said Paradise Baptist Church bishop Jethro C James, a leader in his community who is helping to organise water deliveries.\n\nWhile no amount of lead is considered safe in drinking water, the elevated lead levels in Newark drew national attention last month, when city and state officials were instructed to begin providing bottled water to around 15,000 homes in the city, and after the city repeatedly reported lead levels in water that violate state and national guidelines.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The city, in 2016, shut down water to its public schools citing potential lead contamination, but said at the time that it did not pose a significant public health risk.\n\nIn response, the city began distributing water filters to areas serviced by that treatment plant last October, after testing during five consecutive monitoring periods found elevated levels of lead.\n\nIn early August, however, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) formally notified the city\u2019s mayor, Ras Baraka, that tests at two residences had indicated higher levels of lead than acceptable, in spite of the filters, and suggested further immediate action.\n\n\u201cThe data suggest that use of the specific filtration devices distributed by Newark may not be reliably effective, in this particular situation, in reducing lead concentrations to below that standard,\u201d Peter Lopez, the EPA\u2019s regional administrator, wrote in a letter. \u201cThis means that we are unable at this time to assure Newark residents that their health is fully protected when drinking tap water filtered through these devices.\u201d\n\nIn spite of promises from city officials that water-bottle distribution is being done out of an \u201cabundance of caution\u201d, residents say they do not believe the true scope of the issue has been disclosed. They point to private water analysis done in modern, upscale buildings in the city that are not among the areas flagged for water bottle disbursement \u2013 a sign, they say, that there are plenty of other areas of the city that are affected but not being adequately tested.\n\nFrank Baraff, the director of communications for the City of Newark, told The Independent that some of the efforts on behalf of activists reflect a politicisation of the issue, and said that the city is working alongside the EPA, the New Jersey Department of Health, and other stakeholders to ensure the water coming from the Pequannock Water Treatment Plant is safe, including through anti-corrosion measures. At least one of those modern buildings testing positive for elevated levels of lead receives water from the other supply for the city, the Wanaque Water Treatment Plant.\n\n\u201cThere were only two filters that were not doing the job that they were supposed to. Based on those two filters in the city, the EPA and the state are testing many other filters as well to ascertain what the situation is,\u201d Mr Baraff said of the decision to begin distributing water.\n\nMr Baraff also pushed back on the idea that a state of emergency is necessary to deal with the water concerns in Newark, and said that those calls suggest that the national guard should be brought in to distribute water \u2013 which he rejected.\n\nOn Wednesday, at Paradise Baptist, volunteers did their best to tell residents how they might keep their families safe from potentially dangerous levels of contaminants in their drinking water, even as further testing is conducted throughout the city.\n\nAn 18-wheeler arrived carrying several pallets stacked with water \u2013 a donation from McDonalds, and facilitated by local businessman A Curtis Farrow \u2013 adding to the over 15,000 cases that Bishop James said have been delivered, and then distributed through his church in a cycle that fills the facility on a regular basis, and then empties it hours later. The church is one of the private organisations running water operations to supplement the dispersement by the city itself, which a judge ruled just a week ago does not need to provide water to every at-risk resident.\n\nDonna Jackson was among those volunteers, and held court outside with worried residents as they asked about the water. One woman asked if she could simply keep the hot water running in her shower for 10 minutes, hoping to flush the lead out \u2013 she could not, Ms Jackson said. Another asked about boiling pasta \u2013 and was told, likewise, that it was a bad idea.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s serious. It\u2019s past serious,\u201d Ms Jackson told the group of half a dozen people who crowded around her.\n\n\u201cMany people in Newark still do not understand the severity of this crisis,\u201d she said later.\n\n\u201cThis is another crisis in our city. We have to jump into it and get it going.\u201d", "description": "The scene outside\u00a0the Paradise Baptist Church in Newark, New Jersey, this past week may as well have been one from Flint, Michigan in 2014.", "authors": ["Clark Mindock"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/05/14/newark-water-crisis-lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
