Known as \u201cB Is for Bitcoin,\u201d the book shows children the basics of both the alphabet and cryptocurrency, a technology that is likely to become the norm when they\u2019re full-fledged adults.\n\nShowing Kids the Wonders of Bitcoin\n\nAt press time, cryptocurrency and blockchain can still be considered \u201cemerging\u201d technologies. While bitcoin is already ten years old, it doesn\u2019t have the history of America\u2019s banking system, which emerged during the earliest days of the country through the work of men like Alexander Hamilton. In addition, BTC and its altcoin cousins are still being used primarily for speculative purposes. Compare that to credit cards or cash, which are the primary tools for everyday purposes.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s probably safe to say that blockchain will become a regular form of technology by the time today\u2019s kids have grown up. A technology that will have somehow integrated itself into every business or industry, whether it be shipping, finance, and even entertainment.\n\nAuthor Graeme Moore realized this and wanted to give children an opportunity to understand the technology and money that would likely be far more mainstream by the time they\u2019re in their 20s and 30s. There was just one issue. According to Moore, children don\u2019t buy books; their parents do, and he needed to find an intelligent way of marketing the book to adults who would, in turn, read the book to their kids.\n\nDescribing the process of writing and marketing the story, Moore explains:\n\nTheir parents buy books, especially if you\u2019re writing an ABC book. When the book \u2018Go the [Expletive] to Sleep\u2019 came out, you\u2019re selling a book to the two-year old\u2019s parents. My book is really targeted at me in five to ten years. Flash forward and I have a kid, what would I buy? I would have purchased [\u201cB is for Bitcoin\u201d] because it\u2019s what I want to read to my kid. You know, I don\u2019t want to teach my kid, \u2018A is for apple and B is for ball.\u2019 I want to teach him, \u2018A is for altcoin, busts and booms. B is for bitcoin, when moon?\u2019\n\nHow Do Kids Understand?\n\nOne can only assume what that last sentence means. Also, \u201cbusts\u201d and \u201cbooms\u201d start with B, not A, but we can probably get the picture of what Moore is trying to do. In fact, he initially started writing the book not for money, but simply because he had a one-and-a-half-year-old niece that he was looking to keep busy. He comments:\n\nI was thinking, \u2018What would I want to read to her?\u2019 I don\u2019t want to talk about apples and boast and all that kind of stuff. I want to talk about bitcoin to my niece who is about to learn how to talk.\n\nThe book is now available on Amazon.", "description": "A new book called \"B Is for Bitcoin\" is now available on Amazon designed to teach children about the wonders of crypto.", "authors": ["Nick Marinoff"], "top_image": "https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/https://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2019/07/bitcoin-3215559_1920.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
