Bennett was not at the course as a participant but rather as part of Derby's partnership with the education charity.\n\nAccording to The Mirror, Bennett was 'a club ambassador at Drinkaware's Walking Football Cup in association with the Derby County Community Trust' on September 17.\n\nThe event was designed to 'provide alcohol education and advice to people taking part in walking football activities'. Bennett can be seen stood alongside the participants of the event for a photo.\n\nDerby confirmed on Thursday that Keogh will play no further part this campaign because of a 'serious knee injury'.\n\nThe incident occurred after a planned squad night out which was given the green light by the club.\n\nDerby released a withering statement on Thursday that blamed Keogh and the 'small group' of players for 'not knowing when to stop' and insisted they will 'pay a heavy price for their actions'.\n\nRichard Keogh is out for the rest of the season after he injured his knee in a car collision\n\nThe statement read: 'The players were out as part of a scheduled team-building dinner with staff and while the majority of them acted responsibly and left at around 8pm and were not involved, a small group, including the team captain Richard Keogh, continued drinking into the night.\n\n'They should have known when to stop and also ignored the opportunity to be driven home using cars laid on by the club, and chose to stay out. As a result of an alcohol-related incident, Richard Keogh has sustained a serious knee injury that will prevent him from playing until the end of the season.\n\n'The players involved in the incident on Tuesday evening will be subject to a rigorous internal investigation under the club\u2019s code of conduct and disciplinary procedures, but over and above any punishment they receive we will be expecting them to become involved with the excellent work the Community Trust does helping the communities we serve.\n\nTom Lawrence was taken to hospital after the collision but fortunately escaped without injury\n\n'We have been very clear about our attitude towards alcohol and the players know that at certain and specific times of the season they are permitted a drink together as a group in a controlled environment.\n\n'Those involved in Tuesday\u2019s incident know they will pay a heavy price for their actions, but also that we will support them with their rehabilitation back into the squad and team.'\n\nKeogh had been ever present for the Rams in the league this season, playing every minute of their eight Championship fixtures.\n\nLawrence, a winger who has won 20 caps for Wales, has started all but one of Derby's Championship games so far this season.\n\nBennett and Lawrence will appear at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates Court on October 15\n\nBennett, meanwhile, has made six appearances for Cocu's side this campaign. In 2011, he became the club's youngest ever player when he made his debut at 15 years and 99 days old.\n\nDerbyshire police said on Tuesday: 'Two men have been charged with drink driving after a collision involving a Range Rover Sport and a Mercedes GLC at the junction of Burley Hill and the A6 at Allestree, last night shortly before midnight (Tuesday, 24 September).\n\n'Mason Bennett, 23, of Whaley Thorns near Mansfield and Tom Lawrence, 25, of Duffield were arrested at the scene and charged earlier today. They are due to appear at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates Court on Tuesday, 15 October at 9.30am.'\n\nCocu's side are currently 18th in the Championship but will receive a boost in January when Manchester United and England legend Wayne Rooney arrives as a player-coach.", "description": "Derby County forward Mason Bennett attended a Drinkaware course in the days leading up to the car collision that saw himself and a team-mate charged with drink driving on Tuesday night.", "authors": ["Max Winters For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/26/17/18974174-0-image-a-52_1569515209606.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
