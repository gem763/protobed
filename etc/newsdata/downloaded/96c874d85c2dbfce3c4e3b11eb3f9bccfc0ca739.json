(Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)\n\nMedia critic\n\nFirst, Atlantic Media said it didn\u2019t want to be confused with Republican political consultant Rick Shaftan. Now, Republican political consultant Rick Shaftan says he doesn\u2019t want to be confused with Atlantic Media. And so a trademark dust-up involving a storied Washington media property is going away.\n\nShaftan runs a firm that has traded as Atlantic Media and Research, based in Rodanthe, N.C. Considering the firm\u2019s proximity to the seashore, Shaftan named it \u201cAtlantic,\u201d a rather popular moniker in the business world. Everything seemed to be working fine until Breitbart got involved; in a November 2017 story, the right-wing media outlet published the results of a poll showing Republican Roy Moore ahead of Democrat Doug Jones in the closely watched special U.S. Senate election in Alabama. (Jones won the race).\n\nBreitbart disclosed that the polling was produced by Atlantic Media and Research.\n\nThe people at plain-old Atlantic Media, a home base of Washington media, weren\u2019t pleased with the overlap. \u201cWe recently learned that you are using \u2018Atlantic Media and Research\u2019 (the \u2018Infringing Mark\u2019) to conduct voter surveys and to publish survey results. You are purporting to provide the same service as [Atlantic Media Inc.] and it appears you have intentionally selected this confusingly similar name in an attempt to take advantage of, and trade on, AMI\u2019s reputation and goodwill,\u201d noted a letter from Atlantic Media lawyer Aretae Wyler to Shaftan. The firm request from Atlantic Media to Atlantic Media and Research was to cease and desist.\n\nFor nearly two years, it appears, Shaftan refrained from ceasing and desisting. In August, Atlantic Media Associate General Counsel Allison Prevatt sent him a letter saying, in part, \u201cAs you are aware, Atlantic Media, Inc. (\u201cAMI\u201d) has repeatedly demanded that you cease and desist your trademark infringement against the ATLANTIC MEDIA trademark and affiliated ATLANTIC brands. Your continued violation of federal and state law impairs our intellectual property rights and confuses consumers as to the source of services offered under the infringing name \u2018Atlantic Media and Research.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn the same package as the letter, Atlantic Media sent Shaftan a draft lawsuit that it pledged to file if he didn\u2019t stop using \u201cAtlantic\u201d trademarks.\n\n\u201cHow much of my time is worth fighting these people?\u201d asked Shaftan in a call Thursday with the Erik Wemple Blog, explaining why he decided to give up his trade name in favor of \u201cNeighborhood Research and Media.\u201d He even prepared a news release on the matter, which starts out this way:\n\nAtlantic Media and Research, a polling and media company owned by hard-charging and controversial conservative consultant Rick Shaftan, will be changing its trade name to avoid confusion with The Atlantic Monthly, a leftist anti-Trump magazine that recently published a smear piece full of lies about Supreme Court Justice Bret Kavanaugh.\n\nThe Kavanaugh story is an Atlantic piece penned by Kate Kelly and Robin Pogrebin, co-authors of the recent book \u201cThe Education of Brett Kavanaugh.\u201d It was that piece that convinced Shaftan to bail on \u201cAtlantic.\u201d Said Shaftan to the Erik Wemple Blog, \u201cThe Kavanaugh article was over the top, and I said, \u2018Maybe I should take this seriously and make sure that nobody thinks I have anything to do with them.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnna Bross, a spokeswoman for Atlantic Media, told the Erik Wemple Blog in a statement: \u201cOver the past two years, we\u2019ve sent a number of communications to Mr. Shaftan explaining that his prior use was cut and dried trademark infringement, noting that his infringement was causing serious and problematic brand confusion, and seeking this outcome. We\u2019re pleased that he\u2019s now agreed to change his trade name and that litigation was ultimately not necessary.\u201d\n\nIn Shaftan\u2019s recollection, one of Atlantic Media\u2019s letters came after he became a topic of stories in the Daily Beast and elsewhere in mid-2018 for his social media history \u2014 a newsworthy topic because he was serving as an adviser to failed U.S. Senate candidate Corey Stewart. \u201cAfter #Ferguson, only a fool would start, finance or insure a business in a black neighborhood,\u201d Shaftan wrote in a 2014 tweet. Shaftan once shared a picture of the Confederate flag with this caption: \u201cIf The South Would Have Won, We Would Have Had It Made.\u201d And back in 2010, he tweeted that the NAACP was \u201cthe black KKK, only more violent and dangerous.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think they freaked out or something,\u201d says Shaftan of Atlantic Media\u2019s response to those stories.\n\nAs well they should have!", "description": "Neither wants to represent what the other stands for.
