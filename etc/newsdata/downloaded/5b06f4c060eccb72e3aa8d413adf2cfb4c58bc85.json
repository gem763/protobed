This type of anger presents itself in negative emotions, hostility, and verbal and physical aggression.\n\nFar-reaching implications\n\nDysregulated anger puts teens at greater risk for bullying and for becoming bully-victims (bullies who also are victimised by other bullies), the study said.\n\nPrevious research found that bully-victims are at high risk for poor mental health, behavioural problems and suicidal thoughts, according to the study authors.\n\n\"Implications from our study are far-reaching: Practitioners and parents should be informed of the potential long-term costs of sometimes seemingly harmless parenting behaviours such as belittlement and sarcasm,\" said study senior author Daniel Dickson, from the department of psychology at Concordia University in Montreal.\n\n\"Parents must be reminded of their influence on adolescents' emotions and should take steps to ensure that adolescents do not feel ridiculed at home,\" Dickson said.\n\nThe study was published recently in the Journal of Youth and Adolescence.\n\nImage credit: iStock\n\n", "description": "A new study provides a more complete understanding of how parents' belittling and critical interactions with adolescents thwart their ability to maintain positive relationships with peers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9142/cbac8f5a02b04b2ca31cb7c2f2f38e97.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-24"}
