John Delaney, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, former Vice President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former HUD Secretary Julian Castro, and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard as well as Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\n(Not listed was former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-TX), whose campaign ejected this reporter from an event at Benedict in August.)\n\nTrump signed the First Step Act last year, providing opportunities for certain federal prisoners to reduce their sentences by committing to more intensive rehabilitation programs, including job and skills training.\n\nSome conservatives were skeptical of the legislation, but Trump earned bipartisan praise from within the black community.\n\nDemocratic candidates have tended to ignore the new law in making pledges for new criminal justice reforms, as if unwilling to acknowledge Trump\u2019s success.\n\nThey will have trouble avoiding it this weekend.\n\nJoel B.
