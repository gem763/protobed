REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo\n\n(Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is set to vote on Nov. 5 on a proposal for setting new limits on shareholders\u2019 ability to call for change at companies, a source familiar with the matter said.\n\nThe regulator is expected to propose rules that would require proxy adviser firms to give companies two chances to review proxy materials before they are sent to shareholders, according to the source.\n\nIt will also vote to increase the re-submission thresholds for motions that shareholders file at companies on issues ranging from executive compensation to climate change disclosures.\n\nThe thresholds would rise under the new proposal, although Reuters couldn\u2019t ascertain by exactly how much.\n\nThe new regulations, if passed, would be a blow to activist groups of charged issues such as gun rights and climate change that relied on shareholder proposals for leverage.\n\nIn August, the regulatory body issued new guidelines clarifying how investors and advisory firms that cast ballots on their behalf should vote in corporate elections on issues like pay and diversity.\n\nThe guidance addressed some of the grievances U.S. corporations had about so-called proxy advisers, such as mistakes in reports the advisers issue on specific companies and conflicts of interest in their business models.\n\nProxy advisory firms tell investors how to vote on governance issues in corporate elections and cast ballots on behalf of some asset managers. The role of proxy advisers has gained more attention in recent years as the firms have grown more influential on charged corporate issues.", "description": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is set to vote on Nov. 5 on a proposal for setting new limits on shareholders' ability to call for change at companies, a source familiar with the matter said.", "authors": ["Katanga Johnson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444911085&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O1D4", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
