Photo: Evan Zimmerman\n\nIf it weren\u2019t so doggedly self-serious, Robert Schenkkan\u2019s The Great Society would be almost entertainingly bad. I didn\u2019t see its predecessor, All the Way, which won the Tony for Best Play in 2014 after the production, commissioned by the Oregon Shakespeare Festival and directed by Bill Rauch, came to Broadway with Bryan Cranston as Lyndon Johnson \u2014 but after almost three hours of its leaden, long-winded, blithely self-congratulatory sequel, I think I\u2019m good. Again commissioned by OSF (this time in partnership with Seattle Rep) and again directed by Rauch\u2014whose work on the show feels earnest but mechanical\u2014The Great Society is a lumbering, spiritless mess. It\u2019s the Joe Biden of plays: well-intentioned and clueless, taking up space on enormous stages, out of touch with the culture, embarrassing itself to the point where its big-boned, smiling obliviousness starts to look like hubris. At intermission, the friend who was seeing the show with me whispered, \u201cI wish this play was like Fairview, and the second half was just, like, people commenting on the first.\u201d I\u2019m with her. There\u2019s something so musty about the show \u2014 about its tired Wikipedia structure and about its assumption that what we really need is another star vehicle about a powerful, aging white man \u2014 that part of me kept waiting for Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot to pop up in the front row. This can\u2019t actually be for real, was my recurring thought. But it is, and it\u2019s on Broadway.\n\nTaking over for Cranston, Brian Cox here plays LBJ in the latter years of his presidency. All the Way began after John Kennedy\u2019s assassination and built to Johnson\u2019s pushing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 through Congress. The Great Society picks up in 1965 with an ever-mounting list of pressures for the president and the nation \u2014 from the violent racism meeting Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s (Grantham Coleman) voting-rights marches in the south to the partisan resistance to LBJ\u2019s fleet of social programs, from which the play takes its name, and then to the U.S.\u2019s increasingly sticky, and increasingly deadly, war in Vietnam. There\u2019s no question that Cox is a powerhouse of an actor, but Schenkkan\u2019s play gives him shackles rather than wings. Cox has to talk almost constantly for two hours and 45 minutes, rattling off dialogue that demonstrates just how much pride the script takes in the breadth of its historical research, and just how little ability it has to fashion actual human beings on stage. It\u2019s a marathon with no real reward \u2014 in other words, a slog. Cox ends up shouting about 75 percent of his role, and he\u2019s not the only actor to slip into that trap. What else can they do with such a barrage of pushy, one-dimensional text?\n\nWhen the play isn\u2019t cramming actors\u2019 mouths full of statistics and policy (which Rauch has the cast race through, probably hoping that speed alone will carry us along), it\u2019s wallowing in folksy clich\u00e9. If we\u2019re to believe Shenkkan, no other man has loved him some barnyard symbology like LBJ, whose working-class Texas upbringing is here laid on with a trowel. \u201cOne year when he was feelin\u2019 flush, my daddy took us all to the rodeo,\u201d Cox tells us as the play begins. What follows is a twangy, verbose account of watching a bull rider go from triumph to trampled, a helpful metaphor for Johnson\u2019s presidency. And there are plenty more where that came from. \u201cYou wanna plow a straight furrow, you put blinders on your mule\u201d; \u201cYou know how a rattlesnake eats a rat?\u201d The Great Society almost deserves credit for its total lack of shame: Is there another play out there where, in the same minute and a half of dialogue, you get \u201clike it needs a hole in the head,\u201d \u201cYou \u2026 want to send our boys over there to fight with one hand tied behind their backs?,\u201d \u201ctill the cows come home,\u201d and \u201cThis isn\u2019t my first visit to the rodeo?\u201d The spirit of George Orwell \u2014 for whom clich\u00e9 wasn\u2019t simply a bore but a real cultural danger \u2014 is looming in the Vivian Beaumont, and is not amused.\n\nWhile Johnson wheedles and strongarms and lurches toward his political demise, the historical figures that surround him often feel downright robotic. Rauch\u2019s actors \u2014 even the ones doing their best to hold on, like Coleman, or Bryce Pinkham, who plays Robert F. Kennedy like a Fitzgerald character without a sense of humor \u2014 are stranded. They\u2019re not playing humans; they\u2019re doing impressions. If they\u2019re wooden, it\u2019s not their fault. I\u2019ve seldom heard so many subtly (or not so subtly) flubbed lines in a production of this scale, but it\u2019s no wonder: Shenkkan\u2019s script gives the performers nothing to bite into. The meat of good drama \u2014 eal feeling, personal and interpersonal complexity, human connection \u2014 is in short supply.\n\nTake Richard Thomas as LBJ\u2019s vice-president, Hubert Humphrey. As portrayed in The Great Society, Humphrey has a single job: He handles what I think of as Harry Potter Exposition. This is the thing where Dumbledore, or Hermione, or someone whose brain is working faster than Harry\u2019s, explains something semi-complicated. Then Harry, aghast, will say, \u201cDo you mean to say that\u2026\u201d and reiterate the thing we need to know. \u201cOur first land base in Vietnam?\u201d (italics not mine) says Humphrey, aghast, when Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara (Matthew Rauch) suggests deploying more troops to a newly-constructed base at Pleiku. \u201cEighty miles along the Jefferson Davis Highway, through the worst Klan country in the South?\u201d Humphrey yelps, aghast, when MLK proposes his march from Selma to Montgomery. \u201cMove from a strictly defensive posture of air strikes to a policy of offensive action?\u201d he cries, when McNamara proposes a draft increase and a more aggressive military stance. \u201cThe usual squalid voter-suppression tactics,\u201d he explains, to no one but us, as MLK lists the various ugly methods used to keep black people from registering to vote.\n\nThis stuff is practically self-parody. But The Great Society so manifestly thinks that it\u2019s doing great work, that it\u2019s a Big, Important, Needful Drama. Truly, it\u2019s hardly even a play. It\u2019s a dramatized textbook, written from the same perspective as most of our textbooks \u2014 the perspective that tells the story of history through the struggles of a white male leader, one that asks us to behold his complexity and exercise our sympathies on his behalf. It\u2019s not that the man\u2019s not complex, nor that he doesn\u2019t deserve sympathy \u2014 but this isn\u2019t a deep enough reading to justify itself. And at this point, watching yet another group of black actors have to put on 1960s costumes and embody civil-rights marchers \u2014 while yet another group of white actors wearing flak jackets menaces them with billy clubs and racist epithets \u2014 feels not only stale but increasingly off-putting. This is the picture we\u2019ve been looking at, the play we\u2019ve been watching, for decades, and what do we have to show for it?\n\nThe Great Society is at the Vivian Beaumont Theater through November 30.", "description": "Theater Review: Brian Cox as Lyndon Baines Johnson, LBJ, in \u2018The Great Society,\u2019 Sequel to \u2018All the Way,\u2019 on Broadway", "authors": ["Sara Holdren"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/01/01-the-great-society.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
