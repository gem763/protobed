(Ann Richardson/Ann Richardson)\n\nIt was the deflated clump of balloons floating in Unicorn Lake that really did it.\n\nWhen Jay Falstad found them near his home on Maryland\u2019s Eastern Shore, he dutifully called the Dayton, Ohio, family that had released the balloons \u2014 four days earlier from more than 500 miles away \u2014 with an \u201cif found\u201d note.\n\n\u201cThey just wanted to see how far they would go,\u201d said Falstad, an environmental activist. \u201cThe irony is almost too much.\u201d\n\nThe family\u2019s whimsical experiment unwittingly set in motion the country\u2019s latest ban on releasing helium-filled balloons, part of a national trend that views such \u201cballoon pollution\u201d as, at best, tantamount to littering.\n\nBalloons have the potential to harm marine animals, who can ingest them or become entangled in their strings.\n\nBans on single-use plastics, such as straws and bags that end up in oceans, have garnered much more attention than the ills of wayward balloons, which don\u2019t crack the list of the top 10 most prevalent ocean debris worldwide, experts say. In March, the European Union included cotton swabs in its sweeping ban on single-use plastics, but it didn\u2019t bother including party balloons.\n\n\n\nAssateague mare T6CHU April, May 27, 2019 on the Assateague OSV (over sand vehicle beach) in Maryland.

And glitter could be next.]\n\nBut research into balloon debris is, well, ballooning. Activists who had been toiling on the fringes for decades say their work appears to be at a tipping point.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s picking up speed,\u201d said Danielle Vosburgh, co-founder of the Florida-based advocacy group Balloons Blow.\n\nAt least five states and more than a dozen cities nationwide have some form of a ban, including Virginia and Baltimore. More than a half-dozen other states have considered prohibitions in recent years, according to the National Conference on State Legislatures.\n\nLast summer, Clemson University, under pressure from animal rights activists and environmentalists, decided to abandon its three-decade tradition of releasing thousands of orange helium-filled balloons while the football team stormed into the stadium at each home game.\n\nThe latest ban was an easy sell to the all-Republican Board of County Commissioners in Queen Anne\u2019s County, Falstad and others said, since once someone points out balloon debris it is hard not to notice it.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened to Falstad after the Unicorn Lake discovery: He suddenly saw ribbons in hedgerows, flashes of foil along the highway and biodegradable latex not quickly degrading along his rural county\u2019s miles of marshy shoreline.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those problems hiding in plain sight,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t really focus on it, but once you do, they\u2019re everywhere.\u201d\n\nCommissioner Christopher Corchiarino sponsored the ban at Falstad\u2019s urging and said there was no real opposition, even among constituents who generally don\u2019t like expanding government regulation.\n\nOnce he started talking about the idea, he said, complaints about spooked horses and unwanted debris abounded. He said one constituent discovered a balloon from the Indianapolis 500 race, 600 miles away.\n\n\u201cIt looks neat when they go up into the sky, but they come down,\u201d Corchiarino said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between that and driving by your neighbor\u2019s farm and throwing a McDonald\u2019s bag on it?\u201d\n\nThe local ban, unanimously approved last week, carries a $250 fine. It exempts \u201cunintentional negligence.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf your kid gets a balloon at a carnival and has slippery hands, don\u2019t worry,\u201d he said. \u201cThe sheriff\u2019s deputies aren\u2019t going to jump all over you.\u201d\n\nEmma Tonge, communications director for the Marine Debris Program at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said balloons are not among the world\u2019s top 10 ocean pollutants. But researchers in Australia recently suggested that they might \u201cbe among the most harmful to sea birds, turtles and marine mammals,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of information on how widespread it is,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a full picture of the issue.\u201d\n\nNewer surveys of U.S. coastlines suggest that the balloon problem is more prevalent in this country than worldwide. During a nine-year period ending in 2016, the International Coastal Cleanup program found an average of 31,000 balloons on U.S. beaches each year.\n\nResearchers in Virginia, working with a NOAA grant, last year released a surprising study about the local problem. After four years monitoring five uninhabited beaches, the team discovered that balloon fragments were the most prevalent type of debris.\n\n[On patrol with the enforcer of D.C.\u2019s plastic-straw ban]\n\nThey collected more than 11,400 pieces between 2013 and 2017, along with plastic balloon valves, ribbons and the occasional laminated note addressed to someone in heaven.\n\n\u201cWhen we asked people who release balloons where they thought they went, the number one answer was, \u2018I never even thought about that,\u2019 \u201d said Katie Register, who works for Clean Virginia Waterways at Longwood University and led the research project.\n\nThat research formed the basis of a new, federally backed advocacy campaign called \u201cJoyful Send-off\u201d that attempts to try to change balloon-release behavior in the Mid-Atlantic region.\n\nTonge said people concerned about balloon debris can take action on their own: \u201cOne of the easy things you can do is if you have a balloon, hold on to it. Or, you can just skip the balloon in the first place.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the kind of talk the Balloon Council worries about, the kind that could give balloons a lasting negative stigma.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the product that harms the environment, it\u2019s the misuse that does,\u201d said Lorna O\u2019Hara, executive director of the Balloon Council, a trade group that advocates \u201csmart balloon practices.\u201d\n\nShe said the council weighs in on proposed bans across the country because \u201cthere\u2019s a slippery slope from balloon-release bans to balloon bans.\u201d She says that she hasn\u2019t lobbied in favor of balloon releases but that she\u2019s lobbied against language that called for jail time for repeat violators.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s excessive,\u201d she said. \u201cOur stance is that balloons should be weighted [down] and enjoyed.\u201d\n\nOne chief target of the anti-balloon release crowd is the Indianapolis 500 race, which has opened the annual event by releasing thousands of helium-filled balloons since 1947. A spokesman declined to say exactly how many balloons are released, but he noted race planners use a rubber-derived latex that can biodegrade and do not use strings or ribbons.\n\n\u201cWe continue listening to and evaluating feedback from multiple perspectives on the balloon release,\u201d race spokesman Alex Damron said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re talking with experts to fully understand the impact of this practice and determine its status in the years ahead.\u201d\n\nAfter a public controversy over the release last year, the Indianapolis Star newspaper conducted an 11-month \u201ccitizen science\u201d investigation to look at how much similar balloons can degrade over time. The conclusion: not much.\n\nLast week, Balloons Blow \u2014 the anti-balloon-release advocacy group \u2014 took aim at another prolific source: students at the University of Nebraska. It addressed them with a billboard not far from campus that says: \u201cWe know better. Let\u2019s do better.\u201d\n\nFor a half-century, students there have released red helium balloons during football games at Memorial Stadium. An Omaha resident sued to stop the practice but the lawsuit was thrown out. In March, students voted to keep the balloon release but ban plastic bags on campus.\n\nRead more:\n\nA campaign to eliminate plastic straws is sucking in thousands of converts\n\nThis baby sea mammal captured people\u2019s hearts.
