Get your pneumonia shots. It\u2019s nothing to play with. It takes people out. But I\u2019m telling you, it changed the way I look at wellness,\" she told DeGeneres.\n\nWinfrey, 65, who said she felt \u201ca little rattling\u201d in her chest, got sick after a trip overseas and thought she had a cold only to end up in the emergency room where doctors told her she had pneumonia. The media mogul revealed she was on antibiotics for week, but when they didn\u2019t relieve her symptoms she went back into the hospital for a CT scan, which resulted in a trip to a lung specialist.\n\nWinfrey is the latest in a number of celebrities who have been diagnosed with the infection, which occurs when lungs become infected with bacteria or viruses that cause them to become inflamed. Symptoms include a cough, fever, chills and difficulty breathing. \u201cTODAY\u201d anchor Savannah Guthrie was absent from the show earlier this month for contracting a case of pneumonia. And Whoopi Goldberg had the infection in both lungs, she revealed in March, after her absence on \u201cThe View.\u201d She said it was near-deadly: \u201cI came very close to leaving this earth,\u201d she said.\n\nThe vaping health crisis has also been linked to repertory illnesses in recent weeks. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 450 people from 33 states that have been affected by mysterious cases of pneumonia linked to e-cigarettes.\n\nTake caution if you experience difficulty breathing, chest pain associated with breathing, a persistent cough and an unrelenting fever, Dr. Robert Glatter, an emergency care physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City told FOX Business.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re coughing up mucus, phlegm with any blood mixed in, have a fever, it\u2019s vital to seek care in an emergency department,\u201d Glatter urged.\n\nCDC data indicate that nearly 1 million people get hospitalized for pneumonia, and what\u2019s worse, 50,000 people die from it.\n\nPneumonia can result in a costly trip to urgent care or the emergency room which can range anywhere from $150 to $3,000 depending on how severe the symptoms are.\n\nTo reduce the risk of developing the infection, Glatter advises washing your hands frequently and thoroughly. He also suggests strengthening your immune system by getting enough sleep, eating healthy foods and exercising. Getting vaccines against diseases that might lead to pneumonia, like the flu, are also options, he said.\n\n\u201cBeginning antibiotics and antiviral medications in a timely fashion can be lifesaving in the setting of possible pneumonia,\u201d Glatter said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Oprah was \"very sick\" with pneumonia, and how to prevent a costly trip to the ER.", "authors": ["Jeanette Settembre"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/oprah-winfrey-disney-red-carpet.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
