A few other remnants have been found since then, including three large teeth and lower jaw bone.\n\nThe smattering of remnants paint a partial picture of the mysterious individuals. Genetic tests show that the Denisovans were close relatives of Neanderthals, and that our ancestors bred with them on occasion, perhaps as recently as 15,000 years ago. The prehistoric partnerships left modern Melanesians and indigenous Australians with up to 6% Denisovan DNA, with lesser amounts found in east Asians, Native Americans and Polynesians.\n\nCarmel and his colleague David Gokhman came up with an ingenious approach to infer what the Denisovans looked like. They began by analysing what is called DNA \u201cmethylation\u201d in Denisovans, neanderthals and modern humans. Methylation is a natural process that tags genes with a chemical marker. The markers operate a bit like volume switches, turning a gene\u2019s activity up or down.\n\nBy comparing \u201cmethylation maps\u201d of the three ancient human populations, the researchers worked out which Denisovan genes were as active as those in modern humans or Neanderthals, and crucially which were expressed very differently.\n\nArmed with the list of genes, the researchers next consulted a huge medical database that links human genetic disorders, including skeletal problems, to glitches in the activity of particular genes. From this they worked out how gene activity patterns in the Denisovans would affect their appearance.\n\nTracing the tangled tracks of humankind's evolutionary journey Read more\n\nGokhman and Carmel identified 56 parts of the Denisovan anatomy that differed from modern humans or Neanderthals, 34 of which affected the Denisovan skull. While the Denisovans had wide pelvises like the neanderthals, the analysis published in Cell shows they had wider skulls and longer dental arches, or jaws, making room for their larger teeth.\n\n\u201cPerhaps most surprising was their super-wide skulls, wider than modern humans\u2019 and neanderthals\u2019, who already have wide skulls,\u201d said Gokhman. The finding adds weight to suspicions that a mystery human skull recently unearthed in Xuchang, China, also belonged to a Denisovan.\n\nHighlighting what made the Denisovans unique will help scientists understand how they adapted to the conditions they lived in and what role their genes play in people alive today, said Gokhman.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The study follows an earlier discovery that a fossilised lower jawbone found in the Baishiya karst cave on the Tibetan plateau in China was also from a Denisovan.

Our approach is a step in this direction, but just a step.\u201d", "description": "Unprecedented feat reveals little-known Denisovans resembled Neanderthals but had \u2018super-wide\u2019 skulls", "authors": ["Ian Sample"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31f6e4b9449aa920172848aac7baf1c0a6c6a622/70_1250_2847_1707/master/2847.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c32f2f795afd69b81059baa0d4ff68c6", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
