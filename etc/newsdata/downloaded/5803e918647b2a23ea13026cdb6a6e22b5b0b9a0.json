Hong Kong-based David Naughtin was added soon after.\n\nThe team built its \"Bible\" and then its inaugural portfolio, which took nine months. The fund is up 92 per cent since it launched on March 30, 2017, or 26.7 per cent a year on an annualised basis after fees, to September 30.\n\nSteele's philosophy is based around the power of compounding cashflows. He and the team assess value over a five-year period - and will not pay for any potential value after that date.\n\nThree legs and a cushion for picking global equities\n\nThe \"Bible\" for picking stocks is what Steele calls his wealth creation framework.\n\n\"It\u2019s like a stool - a stool that has three legs and a really comfortable cushion at the top,\" Steele says.\n\n\"The three legs are the characteristics that we think are essential to unlock this compounding of cashflow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The first is competitive advantage. It is easily said but it is less easily done. Competitive advantage is like your licence to print that high economic return year in, year out.\n\n\"Stage two \u2013 which is sort of a nod to governance \u2013 is capital allocation. It's what you do with that excess. If you reinvest it badly, you can destroy value or you could destroy your licence.\n\n\"Those two together form the value engine. And like any good engine you need some fuel.\n\n\"The third leg is structural pathways or runways to growth. And that\u2019s trying to give these companies tarmac to enable that engine to spin. When you get the combination together, that\u2019s when you get the compounding cash flows.\n\n\"The cushion \u2013 because we want it to be a comfortable seat \u2013 speaks to the relationship between the provider of product and service and the customer... is there an ongoing relationship and need for this product or service because that gives us a more defensive path to compounding cashflows.\"\n\nSteele says there are two ways he and the team - the four senior stockpickers, one up-and-comer and two research/modelling assistants - find stocks. [They target companies with market free floats worth more than about $US2.5 billion ($3.6 billion).]\n\nThe first is to run a screen, starting with the MSCI World Index, to find names that have historically had the best cash-based returns on capital. It's backward looking but helps put about 120 to 150 companies on his radar, Steele says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe second is to identify the structural growth theme and \"backsolve it\".\n\nIncreased spending on pets is one of the trends AMP Capital's Simon Steele is keen to invest around. Anne Lin\n\nEither way, the companies are put through rigorous due diligence before the stockpickers will meet management or think about putting it in the portfolio. Due diligence starts with one of the four stockpickers sketching out how the business fits into the \"Bible\" framework, before all four come to the table to produce a list of questions that need to be answered.\n\nSteele says the bulk of its research budget is spent on research panels - aimed at quizzing a companies' suppliers, customers, industry association, competitors and the like - to answer those questions, before it is time to meet the company itself.\n\n\u201cThe most important part of the process is that independent insight,\" he says. \"Sometimes it's one-on-one interviews, sometimes it's surveys.\"\n\nAfter that, all four stockpickers need to support the decision to add a stock to the portfolio, otherwise it is back to more research or dismissed altogether. It's highly collaborative.\n\nSteele's not big on naming stocks, as is AMP Capital policy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobotic surgery, companion pets on trend\n\nHowever, the fund is invested in $US63.5 billion Nasdaq-listed Intuitive Surgical, which develops, makes and markets products for robotic surgery. It has each of the three legs and a cushion, in Steele's eyes.\n\n\"The healthcare environment is pressurised through demographics, which is putting pressure on budgets,\" he says.\n\n\"Almost irrespective of whether it is a private pay or public pay market, anywhere around the world you see those pressures.\n\n\"Are there areas you can extract value? There are if you can deliver good patient outcomes and better healthcare economics. And robotic healthcare surgery does that.\"\n\nAnd in the absence of other stock names - there are 25 to 35 in the portfolio and it is turning over at nearly 20 per cent a year - what other trends is Steele playing?\n\nThere's companion pets and consumers' willingness to spend more on medication, diagnostics and the like for their four-legged friends.\n\nAnd Steele says he likes companies in the luxury sector that typically undersupply their market so even during tougher times there are enough incremental opportunities to keep growing.\n\nTwo-and-a-half-years in, Steele's happy with his team's start and AMP Capital's new global equities strategy appears to be going well.\n\nThe question is whether the upcoming third anniversary will help win asset consultants' hearts and institutional dollars to help get the fund closer to its designed capacity of $US10 billion. It currently manages about $220 million.", "description": "Four stockpickers, one \"Bible\".
