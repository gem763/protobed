Well, in this case, the Special Ops or whoever they were, did this thing also. So maybe he should back off a little bit and stop bragging about it so much.\u201d\n\nCo-host Sunny Hostin added that while it\u2019s a \u201cgood thing\u201d al-Baghdadi is dead, she\u2019s not happy with the way it was handled by the president.\n\n\u201cMy problem is that, at least by New York Times\u2019 reporting, folks inside of the intelligence community are saying that this operation was done despite, or in spite of, President Trump, not because of him,\u201d Ms. Hostin said.\n\n\u201cAnd they\u2019re also saying he had this sort of selective notification about the operation,\u201d she continued. \u201cRather than inform [Nancy] Pelosi, rather than inform Adam Schiff, rather than inform [Charles E.] Schumer, the Gang of Eight, people that are supposed to be informed of this kind of operation, he informed just two people instead of all eight. And I think when you are conducting this kind of operation, which is so important to the national security of our country, you don\u2019t remove yourself from the chain of command. You don\u2019t remove yourself from the norms of reporting.\n\n\u201cIt just concerns me that even in something like this, he just doesn\u2019t follow the rules,\u201d she added.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
