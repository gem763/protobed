This is intended to filter out some of the wrongful fines.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption There are different rules for exemption from prescription charges and paying dental charges\n\nThe committee's report called on the Department of Health to report back in six months with how much progress has been made with this.\n\nBut Ms Hillier warned it must not just be a \"sticking plaster\" that could add another layer of bureaucracy.\n\nCharlotte Waite, of the British Dental Association, backed the committee's call for the fining system to be overhauled.\n\n\"A system that's hurt our most vulnerable patients and treated millions who've made honest mistakes like fraudsters requires more than tweaks,\" she said.\n\n'Unnecessary stress'\n\nCaroline Abrahams, of Age UK, said there was a lot of confusion about eligibility for free treatment for the elderly, and the risk of being fined was \"incredibly stressful\".\n\nLloyd Tingley, of the charity Parkinson's UK, said the NHS fining system \"unfairly discriminates against some of the most vulnerable people\".\n\nFor people with learning disabilities and their families, the threat of fines is a \"huge source of unnecessary stress\", added Dan Scorer, of the charity Mencap.\n\nA spokesman for the Department of Health said it would consider the report and respond in due course.\n\n\"Prescription and dental fraud cost the NHS an estimated \u00a3212m in 2017-18 and it is absolutely right the government takes steps to recoup this money so it can be reinvested into caring for patients,\" he said.", "description": "\"Vulnerable\" people are being fined over claims for free treatment at dentists and doctors, say MPs.", "authors": ["Sean Coughlan", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/155D3/production/_108870578_dentalfines.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
