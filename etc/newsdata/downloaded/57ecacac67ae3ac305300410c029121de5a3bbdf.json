(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump added muscle to the legal team defending against an impeachment investigation led by congressional Democrats on Wednesday, after 2020 re-election rival Joe Biden called for the first time for his impeachment.\n\nBiden, who is at the centre of a controversy over Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine that led the Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives to open an impeachment inquiry, had previously refrained from making an outright plea for impeachment.\n\nTrump continued to paint the probe as a partisan smear, and accused the U.S. intelligence officer who filed the whistleblower complaint that sparked the furore of having political motives. He also added former U.S. Representative Trey Gowdy, best known for his investigations of the administration of Trump\u2019s Democratic predecessor, to his outside legal team.\n\nDuring a campaign stop in New Hampshire, Biden, the Democratic front-runner to face Trump in next year\u2019s presidential election, took the gloves off.\n\n\u201cWith his words and his actions, President Trump has indicted himself. By obstructing justice, refusing to reply with a congressional inquiry, he\u2019s already convicted himself,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIn full view of the world and the American people, Donald Trump has violated his oath of office, betrayed this nation and committed impeachable acts.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo preserve our Constitution, our democracy, our basic integrity, he should be impeached.\u201d\n\nTrump fired back on Twitter.\n\n\u201cSo pathetic to see Sleepy Joe Biden, who with his son, Hunter, and to the detriment of the American Taxpayer, has ripped off at least two countries for millions of dollars, calling for my impeachment - and I did nothing wrong,\u201d Trump wrote.\n\nThe House began impeachment proceedings against Trump last month over his attempts to have Ukraine\u2019s president investigate Biden and his son Hunter Biden, who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s allegations, which he made without evidence, that Biden engaged in improper dealings in Ukraine, there are few signs the controversy has damaged the Democratic former vice president\u2019s 2020 prospects.\n\nPublic opinion polls, including those taken by Reuters/Ipsos, have shown Biden\u2019s support remaining relatively stable.\n\nWHISTLEBLOWER\u2019S LAWYERS RESPOND\n\nTrump on Wednesday again described the inquiry as a partisan attack.\n\n\u201cIt turns out that the whistleblower is a Democrat, strong Democrat, and is working with one of my opponents as a Democrat,\u201d Trump told reporters.\n\nLawyers for the whistleblower responded in a statement, denying that political factors had influenced the complaint.\n\n\u201cOur client has never worked for or advised a political candidate, campaign or party,\u201d they said in a statement. \u201cOur client has spent their entire government career in apolitical, civil servant positions.\u201d\n\nThe day after the White House declared its refusal to cooperate with the impeachment probe, Trump added that he would respond if House Democrats \u201cgive us our rights.\u201d\n\nThe addition of Gowdy to Trump\u2019s legal team marked a pivot from late September, when outside lawyer Jay Sekulow said there were no plans to beef up the legal team. Sekulow announced Gowdy\u2019s hiring on Wednesday.\n\nThe three congressional committees leading the inquiry were working on final arrangements on Wednesday to interview the whistleblower.\n\nThe State Department this week abruptly blocked the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, who had been in touch with Ukrainian officials on Trump\u2019s behalf from speaking to the inquiry.\n\nThe investigation is focused on whether Trump used almost $400 million in congressionally approved aid to Ukraine as leverage to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to begin an investigation of the Bidens.\n\nTrump has defended the July 25 phone call to Zelenskiy.\n\nWith a portrait of former U.S. President Andrew Jackson hanging in the background, U.S. President Donald Trump speaks as he awards the Presidential Medal of Freedom to former Attorney General Edwin Meese in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, October 8, 2019. REUTERS/Leah Millis\n\nMost Democrats want to impeach Trump, even if that means weakening their party\u2019s chances of winning back the White House in 2020, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll.\n\nThe poll, conducted on Monday and Tuesday, found that 55% of Democrats said their party leaders should press ahead with impeachment even \u201cif it means a lengthy and expensive process that could weaken their chances of winning the presidency in 2020.\u201d\n\nAn even higher number - 66% of Democrats - agreed that Congress should pursue impeachment, \u201ceven if that means they will need to postpone efforts to pass laws that could benefit me.\u201d", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump added muscle to the legal team defending against an impeachment investigation led by congressional Democrats on Wednesday, after 2020 re-election rival Joe Biden called for the first time for his impeachment.", "authors": ["Trevor Hunnicutt", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438956578&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF98073", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
