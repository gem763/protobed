BX, -2.75% investors from the worst of the subprime real estate crisis, he told MarketWatch in an interview Monday afternoon.\n\nThe deep-pocketed investor, who has accumulated a net worth of $17.3 billion, according to Forbes, said \u201cthere are a lot of things going on\u201d today that should have investors\u2019 antennae finely tuned.\n\nSchwarzman\u2019s first concern is the manufacturing sector, which is \u201cbasically contracting around the world,\u201d he said. A survey of Chinese manufacturers released Monday, indeed, showed that sector in contraction, while the eurozone\u2019s manufacturing sector has weakened even more acutely.\n\nThe U.S. hasn\u2019t been immune either, with a closely followed reading of manufacturing activity from the Institute for Supply Management showing that sector in contraction in August (a fresh ISM index reading was due Tuesday morning).\n\n\u2018If they can\u2019t accumulate capital, they can\u2019t expand and extend credit to companies.\u2019 Stephen Schwarzman\n\nThe Blackstone boss fears that the Federal Reserve might be headed down a similar monetary path as Japan and Europe, after announcing interest-rate cuts in back-to-back meetings, dialing back rates by a quarter-of-percentage point to a 1.75%-2% range at its most recent gathering ended Sept. 18.\n\n\u2018If you push down [interest rates] too much, you create the problem you are trying to solve.\u2019\n\n\u201cInterest rates are historically low in the United States and you keep driving them lower where do you get? What\u2019s the objective?\u201d he asked. Schwarzman worried that it is low interest rates specifically that are responsible for weak economic growth. \u201cIf you push down [interest rates] too much, you create the problem you are trying to solve.\u201d\n\nHis fourth concern is that the global economy has shifted from synchronized growth as late as 2018 to a one in which expansion is receding as if there was no end in sight. \u201cMost of the major countries around the world have slowing economies,\u201d he pointed out.\n\nFinally, he said the recent travails of some tech companies in public markets \u2014 including Peleton Interactive Inc. PTON, -0.55% disappointing launch Friday, WeWork parent The We Co.\u2019s US:WE decision to scrap its IPO indefinitely, amid the steady slide of stocks of ride-sharing firms Uber Technologies Inc. UBER, +0.59% and Lyft Inc. LYFT, -1.23% \u2014 are \u201csigns of excess\u201d that are typically associated with the late stages of an economic expansion cycle.\n\n\u201cThe prices that these investments have been marked up to in previous rounds\u201d are excessive, he said. \u201cThese [stocks] are trading sardines, not eating sardines,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen its time to eat and you open the can \u2014 and that is like the IPO moment \u2014 and the customers are saying \u2018i don\u2019t want to eat them.\u201d\n\nDespite the excesses he sees in private-technology companies, he doesn\u2019t see signs of a bubble in alternative assets more broadly, like commercial real estate or private-equity targets outside the tech sphere. \u201cPrices are high, but not in excess,\u201d he said.\n\nSchwarzman, meanwhile, remains an optimist about the long-term health of the U.S. economy. His memoir is the tale of middle-class kid from the Philadelphia area who became one of the most powerful men in finance, an adviser to presidents and heads of state. He said there are \u201cgreat fundamental\u201d conditions for the next wave of entrepreneurs to make their mark.\n\n\u201cYou have a ton of money available for investment, more than ever,\u201d he said. \u201cEntrepreneurial activity is in fashion, you see [students] at universities and even at large companies people have a bias toward starting something new.\u201d", "description": "The private-equity titan says \u2018there are a lot of things going on\u201d today that should concern market participants", "authors": ["Chris Matthews", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS326_steve__ZG_20190930144305.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
