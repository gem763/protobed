REUTERS/Phil Noble\n\nDUBLIN (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday he wanted a Brexit deal on Oct. 18 and that he was undaunted by attempts by parliament to block a no-deal exit.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m absolutely undaunted by whatever may take place in parliament,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI think what the British people want us to do is to deliver a deal and to get on and take us out on Oct. 31.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in Ireland alongside Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, Johnson said he was bringing ideas on ways to resolve the Irish border backstop but that a breakthrough was unlikely on Monday.\n\n\u201cI have one message that I want to land with you today, Leo, that is I want to find a deal, I want to get a deal,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cLike you I\u2019ve looked carefully at no-deal, I\u2019ve assessed its consequences both for our country and yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd yes, of course, we could do it, the UK could certainly get through it but be in no doubt that outcome would be a failure of statecraft for which we would all be responsible,\u201d Johnson said.\n\n\u201cSo for the sake of business, for farmers, and millions of ordinary people who are counting on us to use our imagination and creativity to get this done. I want you to know I would overwhelmingly prefer to find an agreement.\u201d", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday he wanted a Brexit deal on Oct. 18 and that he was undaunted by attempts by parliament to block a no-deal exit.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427894000&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF880TR", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
