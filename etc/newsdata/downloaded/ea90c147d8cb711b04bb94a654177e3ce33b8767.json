WEN, -1.88%\n\nCoincidentally, Chick-fil-A is closed on Sundays.\n\nPopeyes announced the return of the chicken sandwich on the same day that parent company Restaurant Brands International Inc. QSR, -3.78% announced third-quarter results. While earnings were in line with expectations, sales fell short.\n\nPopeyes was a bright spot for the quarter with 15.6% sales growth to $1.1 billion and 9.7% same-store sales growth. Other brands in the Restaurant Brands International portfolio are Burger King and Tim Hortons.\n\nOn the earnings call, Jose Cil, chief executive of Restaurant Brands International, said the chicken sandwich launch exceeded the company\u2019s expectations, adding that the same-store sales result was one of the highest growth rates of the past two decades for the brand.\n\n\u201cWhile the chicken sandwich was an important component of overall sales growth in Q3, it\u2019s important to remember that it was only in stores nationally for about two weeks,\u201d Cil said on the call, according to a FactSet transcript. \u201cThe demand was so overwhelming that the supply we secured to support an aggressive sales forecast over several months ran out in approximately 14 days.\u201d\n\nSee: Chipotle\u2019s carne asada supply is running low, bringing the limited-time offer to an early end\n\nAccording to data from Placer.ai, a company that tracks industry trends and provides retail intelligence, Popeyes traffic in August 2019 was 65.2% above the baseline established between July 2017 and September 2019.\n\n\u201cPopeyes saw so much value in the craze that their daily visit numbers came into Burger King range, even though they have less than a third the number of U.S. locations,\u201d Placer.ai wrote on its blog.\n\nThere were 3,192 Popeyes restaurants at the end of the third quarter versus 18,232 Burger King locations.\n\nFor the new launch, the company sounds like it will be better prepared to meet demand.\n\n\u201cOur teams and franchise partners have been working around the clock over the past two months to make sure we\u2019re ready to relaunch and we\u2019re excited it will be back out in the market in just a matter of days,\u201d Cil said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: McDonald\u2019s expected to jump into the chicken sandwich war next year: KeyBanc\n\nWhile Popeyes and Burger King showed growth during the quarter, Tim Hortons struggled. Sales fell 0.1% to $1.77 billion, and same-store sales were down 1.4%. Cil identified weakness in cold beverages, and said the company is focused on key areas like coffee and food innovation.\n\n\u201cWhile global Burger King and Popeyes comps beat expectations \u2013 substantially in the case of Popeyes \u2013 yet another quarter of Tim Hortons misses will only fuel concerns about that brand\u2019s health,\u201d wrote Bernstein analysts in a post-earnings note.\n\nWhile analysts found reasons to be optimistic, they say they will be watching \u201cthe outlook for fundamental and \u2013 potentially managerial \u2013 change at Tim Hortons,\u201d analysts said.\n\nBernstein rates Restaurant Brands International shares outperform.\n\nRestaurant Brands International shares are down 4% in Monday trading, but have gained nearly 26% for the year to date.
