He\u2019s going to win it because of his courage,\u201d Jack said. \u201cHe\u2019s my hero.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s nice, caring and he helps me and boys like me. He\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\nOwen found out about Jack\u2019s degenerative disease through his dad, rugby league great Andy, who played for Wigan Warriors with Jack\u2019s father, also Andy.\n\nThe muscle-wasting disorder will leave the sports-mad lad unable to walk when he reaches his teens. But the youngster gets a huge lift every time he sees Owen\u2019s show of support.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw him do the salute, I thought, \u2018He\u2019s doing that for me and he\u2019s here to help me and other kids with Duchenne\u2019,\u201d Jack told the Mirror.\n\nJack, who lives in Wigan, is one of 2,500 boys in the UK with DMD. Only a small number of girls are affected.\n\nHis mum, Alex, told how it was like a \u201cnuclear explosion\u201d when the \u201clittle boy, we absolutely love and adore,\u201d was diagnosed with the condition in 2011.\n\nBut she says stars like Owen, and Yorkshire and England cricketer Jonny Bairstow who has shown his support for the cause, have helped her and husband Andy to cope.\n\n(Image: DAILY MIRROR)\n\n\u201cTo be told your son has a life-limiting condition was \u00adabsolutely petrifying,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt was like a nuclear explosion had gone off in our lives. The first year was horrific but we got through it thanks to people like Owen.\n\n\u201cAndrew used to play with Owen\u2019s dad in the Wigan Warriors and they told him about Jack.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s amazing what Owen has done \u2013 we are in complete awe.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s on this world stage with millions and millions of people watching around the world and he remembers Jack and remembers the boys we are trying to help. For us that\u2019s incredible.\u201d\n\n(Image: Rossparry.co.uk)\n\nA mutation in Jack\u2019s X-chromosome means he does not make the dystrophin protein, causing his muscles to break down. The family\u2019s charity is funding clinical trials in the US which are already showing some promise.\n\nChildren taking part have shown a 40-60% increase in their production of dystrophin. Now Alex and Andy want the same tests to be carried out in the UK and it can\u2019t happen soon enough.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking when your son says, \u2018They need to come quicker mummy, I need a treatment now\u2019,\u201d Alex said.\n\n\u201cHe knows he\u2019s declining and using the wheelchair more.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so devastating to know there is something that could help but we just can\u2019t get our hands on it yet.\u201d\n\n(Image: EMPICS Sport)\n\nThe mum dreads the prospect of seeing her son unable to walk by the time he reaches adolescence after the loss of every single muscle.\n\n\u201cThere are no words to describe the utter devastation felt upon hearing that your child\u2019s life will be cut short because there is no cure,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cSeeing him struggle as his body wastes away and being absolutely powerless to help \u2013 this is why it is so important to raise awareness.\n\n\u201cSo what Owen is doing for us is incredible and makes Jack\u2019s face light up every time. He loves him, he\u2019s his best friend. His disability affects his movement but he\u2019s on the floor and right in front of the TV when Owen\u2019s on, so we can\u2019t see because he\u2019s so close.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s met Owen quite a few times and has known him since he was a baby.\n\n\u201cHe has been an England mascot and walked on holding Owen\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cHe was the most excited for [last Saturday\u2019s] game against New Zealand. I\u2019m sure he will be up at 5am on Saturday.\u201d\n\nAlex and Andy have another son, seven-year-old James, who also worships the England captain. \u201cHe\u2019s my crazy child and he adores his big brother. He hugs him all the time,\u201d Alex said. \u201cHe helps him as much as he can, he\u2019s become his legs. James adores Owen as well, he just stares at Owen. They think he\u2019s a superhero.\n\n\u201cWhen Owen makes the salute it makes them both so ecstatic. We would love to see Owen lift that World Cup on Saturday and see him do the salute. This simple gesture has changed Jack\u2019s life. Without us funding the research the advances that have been made would not have happened.\u201d\n\n(Image: Simon Wilkinson/SWpix.com/REX)\n\nOwen\u2019s support has also affected the lives of other youngsters with the condition.\n\nMum-of-three Emily Crossley from London, whose son Eli, also aged 12, has DMD, said: \u201cWhat Owen has done is open doors for us.\n\n\u201cEli loves football and when he was watching the [semi-final] on Saturday he said, \u2018I prefer rugby now\u2019. His dad nearly fell off his chair.\n\n\u201cLife is really hard for them every day.\n\n\u201cThey are surrounded by their healthy friends so seeing someone who everybody hero-worships make this gesture is life-affirming for them.\n\n\u201cIt is one real beacon of hope. To know that someone so incredibly inspiring would take a moment to remember Jack is phenomenal.\n\n\u201cIt gives all the other boys with Duchene pride and hope as well.\u201d", "description": "The England captain repeats the same gesture every time he scores to help raise awareness of Duchenne muscular dystrophy", "authors": ["Lucy Thornton", "Image", "Daily Mirror", "Rossparry.Co.Uk", "Empics Sport", "Simon Wilkinson Swpix.Com Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20760790.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screen-Shot-2019-10-30-at-100201JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
