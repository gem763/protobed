But they are unable to predict when the ice would break away.\n\n\u201cThere are currently no empirical models or methods that can enable quantitative predictions in the case of glaciers with sliding dynamics such as Planpincieux,\u201d Miserocchi added.\n\nThe warning comes as world leaders meet in New York for the UN climate action summit. The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said: \u201cThe news that part of Mont Blanc risks collapsing is a warning that should not leave us indifferent. It must shake us all and force us to mobilise.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A roadblock in Courmayeur, Aosta, Italy, Photograph: Flavio Lo Scalzo/Reuters\n\nIn 2017, about 50 cubic metres of ice fell from Planpincieux, while in September last year a mass of ice broke away from the Glacier de la Charpoua, on the south-east side of the Aiguille Verte, on the French side of Mont Blanc.\n\nMiserocchi\u2019s order came into force on Tuesday and includes the evacuation of homes and mountain refuges in the area. He said it was a precautionary measure and there was no threat to residential areas or tourist establishments. The zones affected are in the area of Val Ferret.\n\nRising temperatures are causing glaciers to melt, with environmental activists in Switzerland holding their second \u201cmourning ceremony\u201d on the evaporating Pizol glacier in the country\u2019s Glarus Alps on Monday. The glacier has lost up to 90% of its volume since 2006. In August, a similar event was held at a glacier in Iceland.\n\nA heatwave across Europe this summer is also said to have accelerated the melt speed.", "description": "Italian mayor orders roads closed and homes evacuated over fears ice will break away", "authors": ["Angela Giuffrida", "Ben Fogle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e7e5485f389613eaaaac172dbf68d782bbb2ed4/0_0_2761_1657/master/2761.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1e33f577fb0699065d8d544315bb7cc0", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
