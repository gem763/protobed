The new disciplinary case must run its course.'\n\nEuan Philipps, spokesman for campaign group Labour Against Antisemitism, said: 'Today's High Court judgement, that the suspension of Chris Williamson MP must continue and that the disciplinary process must run its course, is welcome.\n\n'We hope that the Labour Party will now expel Mr Williamson as quickly as possible - along with the hundreds of cases of reported antisemitism our volunteers have submitted which remain undealt with.'\n\nA Labour Party spokeswoman said: 'The court has upheld Chris Williamson's suspension from the party and has said his disciplinary case must run its course.'", "description": "Chris Williamson's loss of the party whip was upheld at the High Court today - potentially stopping him from standing in his Derby North seat in any snap Brexit election.", "authors": ["David Wilcock", "Whitehall Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/17/19549222-0-image-a-69_1570724773749.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
