Danish comedian Sofie Hagen (pictured), for example, tweeted that the study was 'f**king ignorant'\n\nPsychologist Gil Greengross of Wales' Aberystwyth University and colleagues from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro reviewed 28 past studies that investigated how funny participants \u2014 5,057 in total \u2014 were.\n\nThe team also wanted to determine whether the stereotype that men are innately funnier than women had any grounding in reality.\n\n'This stereotype is shared by both men and women \u2014 but of course, just because it exists does not mean it is true,' Dr Greengross wrote in Psychology Today.\n\nIn many of such studies into humour, participants are asked to write a witty caption for a cartoon \u2014 which were then anonymised and rated by independent judges.\n\nAccording to Dr Greengross, the findings revealed that, 'to the best of our knowledge, on average, men appear to have higher humour production ability than women.'\n\nIn fact, having ruled out the existence of confounding factors like participant age or nationality, the team found that 63 per cent of men are funnier than the average woman.\n\n'The fact that men, on average, appear to be funnier than women, does not imply that every single man is funnier than every single woman,' he cautioned.\n\n'There are many great female comedians such as Sarah Silverman, Tina Fey, Ali Wong and historically, Lucille Ball, Joan Rivers, and many, many more.'\n\n'All these great comedians are funnier than 99.9 per cent of all men.'\n\nThe investigations judged participants' senses of humour \u2014 for example, by asking them to write a caption to go with a cartoon. Pictured, British comedian Romesh Ranganathan\n\nThe team have some theories as to why humour might come with a gender gap.\n\n'It is possible that the view that women are less funny is so pervasive that societal forces discourage girls and women from developing and expressing their humour, making a woman less likely to be perceived as funny,' wrote Dr Greengross.\n\n'There is, however, minimal evidence to support the view that our society suppresses women from producing and exhibiting humour.'\n\nThe researchers caution that the findings do not suggest all men are funnier than all women \u2014 with many women comedians being funnier than '99. per cent' of men. Pictured, American stand-up comedian and actress Ali Wong\n\n'On the other hand, the evidence does suggest that humour plays a major role in mating, with a strong evolutionary basis,' Dr Greengross added.\n\nWomen \u2014 who bear heavier costs of reproduction \u2014 are typically more discriminating when it comes to picking a mate, he explained.\n\nHumour is a good proxy for intelligence \u2014 which remains a desirable quality in a partner and would have been even more crucial during the hunter\u2013gatherer part of human evolution.\n\nPsychologist Gil Greengross of Wales' Aberystwyth University and colleagues from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro reviewed 28 past studies that investigated how funny participants \u2014 around 5,000 in total \u2014 were. Pictured, US comedian Tig Notaro\n\n'Men, on the other hand, prefer women who laugh at their humour,' Dr Greengross wrote.\n\n'That means that over our evolutionary history, men likely had to compete harder with other men to impress women with their sense of humour.'\n\n'Plenty of evidence supports this view, showing how important it is for women to find a man with a great sense of humour, while men generally do not place a high value on women's humour production ability.'\n\nComedian Marina Bye, pictured here with sibling Maddy, told Radio 1 Newsbeat that she felt the study was 'unnecessary', adding that 'they could've done something progressive'\n\nThe studies the team reviewed only focused on regular people \u2014 not professional comedians.\n\nHowever, comedian Marina Bye told Radio 1 Newsbeat that she felt the study was 'unnecessary', adding that '[the researchers] could've done something progressive.'\n\n'With comedy that's the last thing you want,' she said, expressing concern that the findings could discourage women from entering the comedy arena.\n\n'You want the worst and the best comedians to try because you never know. This study will cripple bravery.'\n\nStand-up comedian Eleanor Morton, pictured here with MP Ed Milliband, also dismissed the research.
