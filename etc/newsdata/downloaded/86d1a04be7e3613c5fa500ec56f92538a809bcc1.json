REUTERS/Alexei Filippov\n\nLast week, FIFA and the Asian Football Confederation turned down a request from the Football Federation of the Islamic Republic of Iran to move the game outside Hong Kong due to the protests that have hit the city over the past three months.\n\nBut Hong Kong coach Mixu Paatelainen stressed the visitors should not be affected during their stay in the Asian financial hub.\n\n\u201cOne thing I know is that Hong Kong is a safe place for any team to come and play,\u201d said the former Dundee United and Bolton Wanderers striker.\n\n\u201cProtesters don\u2019t come to protest against these teams who come here to play sport. There\u2019s no problem at all.\n\n\u201cI know that the Iran team will be safe and they can prepare here and there\u2019s no problem at all.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m aware of the protests, but we don\u2019t pay any attention to those things. We prepare for the task in hand and put the political issues aside,\u201d he said.\n\nGames involving the Hong Kong team have been a focal point for protests against the Chinese government in the past, with FIFA fining the Hong Kong Football Association in early 2016 after fans jeered the Chinese national anthem.\n\nThat, though, did not deter fans from continuing to protest, with further abuse directed at the anthem at subsequent matches.\n\nFans also protested against their government during Manchester City\u2019s friendly match against Hong Kong club side Kitchee in July and further protests are expected on Tuesday at the game at Hong Kong Stadium.", "description": "Iran's soccer players have nothing to fear from anti-government protests in Hong Kong, said the head coach of the city's representative team, despite an unsuccessful bid by the visitors to play Tuesday's World Cup qualifier in a neutral venue.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1428094522&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8810G", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
