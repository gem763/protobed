In the midst of chatting about their shared regard for shooting in the 35mm format, he said that while he shot much of his gangster film \u201cThe Irishman\u201d that way, there was also \u201ca great deal of CGI\u201d -- or computer-generated imagery -- because the decades-spanning plot called for the \u201cyouthification\u201d of stars Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Al Pacino.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re so used to watching them as the older faces,\u201d Scorsese said, explaining his concern. \u201cWhen we put them all together, it cuts back and forth \u2026 Now, it\u2019s real. Now, I\u2019m seeing it. Now, certain shots need more work on the eyes, need more work on why these exactly-the-same eyes from the plate shot, but the wrinkles and things have changed. Does it change the eyes at all? If that\u2019s the case, what was in the eyes that I liked? Was it intensity? Was it gravitas? Was it threat?\u201d\n\nHogg responded, \u201cIt\u2019s quite complicated.\u201d\n\nAnd so it is. We finally got a closer look at those complicated eyes in a trailer that dropped during De Niro\u2019s Wednesday appearance on \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.\u201d The Netflix film, based on the 2004 book \u201cI Heard You Paint Houses,\u201d jumps through the life of Frank \u201cThe Irishman\u201d Sheeran (De Niro) as he recounts the hit jobs he says he carried out for the Bufalino crime family.\n\nThis means we see him as a 20-something, as an elderly man and as everything in between. We also encounter characters played by Pesci (Russell Bufalino); Pacino (Jimmy Hoffa, whose assassination Sheeran and Bufalino plot); Ray Romano; Bobby Cannavale; Jesse Plemons; and Anna Paquin.\n\nOther than its remarkable length \u2014 after everyone balked at the 210-minute runtime, Scorsese trimmed it to a mere 209 \u2014 and cast of Oscar winners, \u201cThe Irishman\u201d has attracted the most attention for the CGI that so worried its director. While on \u201cThe Tonight Show,\u201d De Niro joked that the de-aging process \u201ctook a lot of work,\u201d but that he was happy \u201cbecause maybe it\u2019ll extend my career for another 30 years.\u201d\n\nA lot can happen in a lifetime. pic.twitter.com/S2eLY1dB88 \u2014 The Irishman (@TheIrishmanFilm) September 25, 2019\n\nWe, too, are happy, because if you have even a shred of a reason to de-age some of Hollywood\u2019s most esteemed actors, you should definitely do it. The world has become a high-speed Tilt-a-Whirl and, in certain contexts, it\u2019s best to lean into the chaos. Scorsese seems to get this, as does Ang Lee, whose upcoming movie \u201cGemini Man\u201d features Will Smith playing an assassin who must fight a younger clone of himself. Lee didn\u2019t take the easy route of simply casting Smith\u2019s rapper-actor son Jaden in the role, because, well, when does he ever take the easy route? (Case in point, \u201cGemini Man\u201d also employs the same, polarizing high frame rate that Lee used in 2016\u2032s \u201cBilly Lynn\u2019s Long Halftime Walk.\u201d)\n\nPerhaps they took a cue from David Fincher\u2019s 2008 film \u201cThe Curious Case of Benjamin Button,\u201d which centered on a man (Brad Pitt) who ages in reverse and scooped up three Oscars \u2014 for best art direction, makeup and visual effects. While the past few months have reminded us of how lovely it can be to see Pitt in his normal form, there is an argument to be made in favor of seeing him transform from an elderly man technically the age and size of a child, to a child the age (but not size?) of an elderly man.\n\nThere have been less ambitious de-aging efforts, of course, including a scene from \u201cCaptain America: Civil War\u201d in which Robert Downey Jr. plays a teenage Tony Stark \u2014 a notable visual effects job that Fallon referenced in the De Niro interview. There have been also slightly terrifying entries into the canon, such as the recent \u201cIt: Chapter Two\u2019s\u201d decision to digitally alter Finn Wolfhard\u2019s face because he grew up too much in the few years between the original film, released in 2017, and its sequel.\n\nYou win some, you lose some.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear where the de-aging in \u201cThe Irishman\u201d will rank in terms of its believability, as the effects featured in the trailer seem to have improved upon what was in the initial teaser. Regardless, Scorsese can rest easy knowing that his film\u2019s CGI faces will never be as horrific as the half-human, half-vampire baby Renesmee in the final installment of the \u201cTwilight\u201d saga (which, mind you, was already a replacement for a scary animatronic baby the cast and crew deemed \u201cChuckesme\u201d).
