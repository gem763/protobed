Other NATO allies Germany and France said they were banning weapons exports to Turkey. The head of the Arab League denounced the operation and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke to Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan to express his \"grave concern\" about the offensive.\n\nAnkara began its onslaught against the YPG militia, which it says is a terrorist group backing Kurdish rebels in Turkey, after Trump withdrew some U.S. troops there to support Kurdish forces in the fight against Islamic State.\n\nThe assault has raised international alarm over its mass displacement of civilians and the possibility of Islamic State militants escaping from Kurdish prisons leading to a revival of the jihadist group's insurgency in Syria.\n\nThe Kurdish-led administration in Syria's northeast said nearly 200,000 people had been uprooted so far by the fighting, while the U.N. World Food Programme said more than 100,000 had left Ras al Ain and the town of Tel Abyad.\n\nTurkey's stated objective is to set up a \"safe zone\" inside Syria to resettle many of the 3.6 million Syrian war refugees it has been hosting. Erdogan has threatened to send them to Europe if the EU does not back his assault.\n\nTurkish officials posted photos on Saturday showing deserted streets and Turkish-backed Syrian rebels standing on Kurdish militia flags in Ras al Ain.\n\n\"The (Syrian rebel) National Army took control of (Ras al Ain) town center this morning,\" a senior Turkish security official said, referring to Ankara-backed rebels. \"Inspections are being conducted in residential areas. Mine and booby trap searches are being carried out.\"\n\nMarvan Qamishlo, a spokesman for the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), in which the YPG comprises the main fighting element, said they had carried out only a \"tactical retreat\" in Ras al Ain in response to hours of heavy Turkish bombardment.\n\n\"Now the SDF's attack has started and there are very fierce clashes,\" Qamishlo told Reuters. \"The clashes are continuing in the industrial district,\" the part of Ras al Ain closest to the border.\n\nSpeaking as night fell Mustafa Bali, head of the SDF media office, said the SDF remained in control inside Ras al Ain.\n\nThe senior Turkish official said \"nearly all\" YPG forces had fled south from Ras al Ain. Turkish artillery continued to shell parts of the town, a Reuters reporter said.\n\nThe SDF holds most of the northern Syrian territory that once made up Islamic State's \"caliphate\" in the country, and has been keeping thousands of fighters from the jihadist group in jail and tens of thousands of their family members in camps.\n\nThe SDF accused Turkey-backed rebel fighters of killing a Kurdish politician in a road ambush on Saturday. The rebel force denied it, saying it had not advanced that far.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based organization which reports on the war, said Turkey-backed groups had killed nine civilians on the road, including Hervin Khalaf, co-chair of the secular Future Syria Party.\n\n(Graphic: Where Kurds live - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/SYRIA-SECURITY-TURKEY-USA/0H001QXBW8SM/KURDS.jpg)\n\nTURKEY SEEKS 'SAFE ZONE'\n\nIn the latest international censure of Turkey's incursion, Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Aboul Gheit called it an \"invasion of an Arab state's land and an aggression on its sovereignty\".\n\nIraq, the current president of the League, said the offensive \"will exacerbate humanitarian crises, increase the suffering of the Syrian people and strengthen the ability of terrorists to reorganize their remnants.\"\n\nTurkey dismissed the criticism, saying Syrian Arabs had been the biggest victims of the YPG, which it said had driven hundreds of thousands from their homes in areas it controls.", "description": "ANKARA/BEIRUT (Reuters) - Turkish-backed Syrian rebels advanced into the border town of Ras al Ain in northeast Syria on Saturday but it was unclear how far, with Turkey saying it had taken the town center, and Kurdish-led forces denying that and saying they were counter-attacking.
