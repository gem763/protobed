When they didn\u2019t show up for that event, the IAAF disqualified them from the rest of the meet, including the 200 and 4x100 relay, which both were hoping to run.\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press, Okagbare said an appeal to IAAF was in the works and that federation president Sebastian Coe had called her and told her the case was being reviewed.\n\n\u201cHe told me he understood what was going on, and to get some sleep,\u201d Okagbare said. \u201cMy hope is that they get the appeal on time.\u201d\n\nIf the appeal is accepted, Oduduru would run in the 200-meter heats set for Sunday and Okagbare would run Monday.\n\nIAAF rules state that, unless they\u2019re injured or sick, athletes who withdraw after a certain deadline become ineligible for the rest of the championships.\n\nOkagbare said both she and Oduduru repeatedly told the Nigerian federation that they had no plans to run in the 100.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the first time they\u2019ve done a thing like this,\u201d she said. \u201cThey deal with the African Games and national championships, but this is not Africa. We\u2019re not running at national championships. People here take the rules seriously and we keep bending them. It\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s incompetency. I feel like they\u2019re wasting my world championships. I don\u2019t know how many more I have. I\u2019m 30.\u201d\n\nOfficials at the Nigerian Athletics Federation did not immediately respond to emails sent by AP.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Two Nigerian medal contenders are in jeopardy of being booted from world championships because their federation entered them in events they never planned to run.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Eddie Pells"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
