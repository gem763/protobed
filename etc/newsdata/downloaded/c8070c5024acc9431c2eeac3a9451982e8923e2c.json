John Lewis (D-Ga.), the civil rights icon and fellow African American who also sports a shaved, bald head.\n\nNo longer in the shadows of other giants, Cummings had emerged as a powerful voice at home in West Baltimore, where he served as peacemaker during riots about police violence that spring. In Congress, he had risen to the role of top Democrat defending then-President Barack Obama from nettlesome GOP oversight investigations.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOver the next four years, after deciding to stay in the House, Cummings became a force of nature. After his elevation to chairman of the Oversight and Reform Committee, his investigations put the fear of political death in administration officials.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many friends would call me and be in fear because they got a letter from Cummings. But he was a man of fairness,\u201d Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said Thursday during tributes on the House floor after Cummings died Thursday morning.\n\nEven President Trump saw Cummings as a deep rival, particularly after he started investigations that examined how migrant children were being treated at the border. On a Saturday morning in late July the president launched into a Twitter attack against Cummings, against Baltimore, that was filled with venom.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAlready ailing, Cummings appeared a week later at a park opening in Baltimore where he called on his constituents to embrace hope for their city and ignore the presidential harassment. \u201cIt gives people light \u2014 it brings light into their lives. I have so much to do,\u201d Cummings said.\n\nThe lawmaker, at that moment, had completed a life story that seems like a political fairy tale in a Congress dominated by career politicians and family dynasties.\n\nHis parents were sharecroppers in South Carolina, toiling on the same land where their ancestors had served as slaves. In the 1940s, they moved to Baltimore and raised seven children, sending young Elijah to special-education classes because he struggled in elementary school.\n\nAD\n\nAbout 60 years later \u2014 after becoming an honors student at Howard University, serving 14 years in the Maryland state assembly, winning a special election in 1996 to the U.S. House \u2014 Cummings could scare the president of the United States.\n\nAD\n\nBut Cummings knew that alliances and respect from rivals would only make him more powerful. So his friendships and associations ranged from Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), the founder of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a leading candidate for the 2020 presidential nomination who worked with him on the opioid crisis and income inequality.\n\nBattling ligament issues the past two years, which led to an infection during one hospitalization, Cummings usually steered his walker to a seat in the front row of the House chamber, where the Congressional Black Caucus usually holds court.\n\nAD\n\nOn Thursday, as McCarthy, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and others paid tribute, that seat was filled with white hydrangeas and white roses. Lawmakers huddled and hugged at his seat during votes, whispering to one another about what Congress had lost.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt lost civility, it lost a degree of civility,\u201d Lewis said in an interview after votes. \u201cIt lost a greater sense of hope and optimism. Elijah Cummings was one of the most hopeful, one of the most optimistic individuals I ever met.\u201d\n\nHe never ran for an elected leadership position, but Cummings achieved a profile that few members of the Congressional Black Caucus have ever reached. His booming voice could instill fear among those meeting him for the first time.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to ask you plainly,\u201d Cummings told Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) when they first met. \u201cAre you here to do the work?\u201d\n\nThe 29-year-old political celebrity already had millions following her social media posts on everything from domestic policy to cooking. As she recounted in a series of Twitter posts, on that day Trump attacked Baltimore, Ocasio-Cortez promised she would.\n\nAD\n\nHe supported her for a seat on his committee and early on she repaid him with some of the best questioning of witnesses. \u201cYou want to be on his team,\u201d she wrote.\n\nIn late February, Cummings faced his first big test as chairman during a hearing with the president\u2019s former lawyer, Michael Cohen. The blockbuster hearing got live national coverage as Cohen testified about payments to buy the silence of Trump\u2019s alleged mistresses and his racist behavior.\n\nAD\n\nMeadows had an African American woman who worked for the Trump Corporation and the Department of Housing and Urban Development stand behind him as a prop to demonstrate some black support for the president.\n\nRep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), a freshman, called it a \u201cracist\u201d act, and Meadows demanded an apology. The entire hearing, a success for Democrats to that point, was about to go off the rails, until Cummings stepped in and negotiated the peace.\n\nAD\n\nThe next day, Meadows approached Tlaib on the floor. They talked and embraced.\n\n\u201cHe would always just calm the waters,\u201d Pelosi recalled Thursday.\n\nLewis said Thursday that as Cummings\u2019s stature grew, he was on the other end of the mistaken identity. On a recent flight from Atlanta to Washington, a former senator stopped by Lewis\u2019s flight seat.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHello Elijah,\u201d he told Lewis.\n\nBack in 2015, after Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) announced she would retire from the Senate in 2016, Cummings faced pressure to run for the seat, particularly after the riots in Baltimore.\n\nMaryland had never elected a black senator, and Cummings had a good sense of his chances to win. But he sometimes responded to inquiries by asking whether someone knew the average life expectancy of a black man in America.\n\nIt was about 69 years old, the age Cummings would have turned in January.\n\nAD\n\nInstead, he stayed in the House and became more powerful than most senators.\n\nIn one of his final prominent speeches, three weeks after Trump\u2019s Twitter outburst, Cummings connected today\u2019s hate-filled rhetoric to the mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, a couple of days before, calling on Congress to do better.\n\n\u201cGod has called me to this moment,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cI did not ask for it.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The Maryland Democrat, who died Thursday, knew that alliances and respect from rivals would only make him more powerful \u2014 so his friends ranged from Rep.
