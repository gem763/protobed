'While I was talking to Johannes on my office phone, my mobile rang with a call from 'Johannes', which I ignored.\n\n'Less than a minute after finishing the call with Johannes, the fake Johannes rang again. His voice was identical but as soon as I asked who was calling, the line went dead.'\n\nInsurer Euler Hermes, which paid out over the scam, said the criminals had not been identified.\n\nPhilipp Amann, head of strategy at the Cybercrime Centre at European police agency Europol, warned that similar attempts at fraud may have already been made but gone undetected.\n\nProfessor Anthony Glees, director of the Centre for Security and Intelligence Studies at the University of Buckingham, added: 'This is a real and present menace.\n\n'What is particularly disturbing is that we have long thought voices to be very distinctive. But this deep fake technology shows that even voices can be faked.\n\n'If that is the case, the sky is the limit to the extent that people can be defrauded. We have reached the final frontier of fakery and at the moment the fraudsters have got there first. We need to catch up with them.'\n\nRafe Pilling, senior researcher with cybersecurity firm Secureworks, said: 'Deep fake is certainly another tool that can be added to the criminal arsenal and businesses should design security systems that recognise this threat and counter it.'", "description": "It is thought to be the first time deep fake technology has been used to defraud a company, the UK executive was told to make the bank transfer to a Hungarian bank account immediately.", "authors": ["Jonathan Bucks For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/01/19347892-0-image-a-22_1570322692319.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
