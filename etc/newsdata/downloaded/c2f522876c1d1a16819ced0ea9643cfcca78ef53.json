This was only possible since a holding penalty and three false starts backed the Bucs up to their own 11 with eight seconds left in the half, and Bradley Pinion sent a punt just 39 yards.\n\nLittle-known rule could have ballooned Panthers\u2019 lead\n\nMost fans aren\u2019t familiar with fair catch kicks, possibly because there hasn\u2019t been one since Phil Dawson attempted it on Sept. 26, 2013.\n\nAll NFL fans know that teams can kick a field goal by snapping the ball about 8 yards back and holding it. That\u2019s the simple one. But if they call a fair catch on a punt, they may attempt a free kick from the line of scrimmage on the very next play with the defense standing at least 10 yards back.\n\nStory continues\n\n.@Panthers fair-caught a punt with one second in the half...\n\nThen tried a fair catch kick for three points!\n\n\n\nYou don't see this every Sunday. \ud83d\udc4b\ud83d\udc5f\ud83c\udfc8\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcfa: #CARvsTB on @NFLNetwork | @NFLUK\n\n\ud83d\udcf1: NFL app // Yahoo Sports app\n\nWatch free on mobile: https://t.co/xLc7ljuEnj pic.twitter.com/FAPYwxJa9d \u2014 NFL (@NFL) October 13, 2019\n\nUnfortunately, it was all for naught as Slye, whose career long is from 55 yards, missed wide right. Still, it was a chance to share one of the most quirky rules in the league with a new set of fans. There\u2019s a long history of the obscure play with some funny footage.\n\nNo team has made a free-kick attempt in over 40 years\n\nPanthers head coach Ron Rivera is 57, and he was still in high school the last time a team made a free-kick attempt. That honor belongs to San Diego Chargers kicker Ray Wersching, who made one from 45 yards out on Nov. 21, 1976.\n\nThere have been only six successful free-kick attempts since Curly Lambeau made one in 1921. Even then, the longest successful one came from Green Bay\u2019s Paul Hornung from 52 yards out in 1964.\n\nThe last eight attempts during the regular season have all been unsuccessful, although many were long-shots. Five of them came from 68 yards or longer with just seconds remaining in the first half.\n\nBecause the rule is so obscure, some coaches didn\u2019t even know how it worked. On Sept. 22, 1999, Dallas Cowboys coach Chan Gailey told punt returner Wayne McGarity to fair catch a punt, which he did on the Atlanta Falcons\u2019 47. But he didn't realize he could make an attempt with no time left on the clock, so the Cowboys missed out on a chance to add three points.\n\nPanthers kicker Joey Slye nearly became the first player to make a fair-catch kick attempt since 1976.
