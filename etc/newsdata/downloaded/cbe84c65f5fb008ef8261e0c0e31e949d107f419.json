His mental illness developed within three weeks of the EU referendum on June 23, 2016 (stock image)\n\nThe patient, in his forties, was so ill following the referendum he tried to burrow out of hospital with his bare hands (stock image)\n\nThe patient from Nottingham, whose anonymity has been protected, said: 'I was looking at the electoral map of voting for the EU. I am in a constituency that reflects an opinion that is not for me.'\n\nAll but one council area of Nottinghamshire voted Leave.\n\nHe was eventually diagnosed with acute and transient psychotic disorder (ATPD) \u2013 a mental illness characterised by a sudden onset of symptoms and complete recovery within three months.\n\nIn a report of the case published yesterday, his psychiatrist, Dr Mohammad Zia Ul Haq Katshu, said it was 'the first case of ATPD precipitated by Brexit'.\n\nWHAT IS ACUTE AND TRANSIENT PSYCHOTIC DISORDER? Acute and transient psychotic disorder (ATPD) is characterised by the onset of delusions, hallucinations and 'severe disruption of ordinary behaviour' that do not continue into the longer-term. These symptoms can develop quickly - within weeks - and recovery can be similarly rapid. Temporary breakdowns only happen to between four and 10 people per 100,000 each year. Usually complete recovery can be reached within a few months, often within a few weeks or even days. It is defined in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, a medical classification list by the World Health Organization (WHO). If the disorder persists for longer, it would require a change in classification. WHO says it may or may not be linked to stressful events preceding the onset of symptoms by one to two weeks. Acute schizophrenia-like psychotic disorder is a sub-category of ATPD. According to WHO, it is diagnosed when the psychotic symptoms justify a diagnosis of schizophrenia but have lasted less than a month. Symptoms which persist longer would change the diagnosis to schizophrenia. Psychosis can be triggered by a pre-existing mental health condition, such as schizophrenia, extreme stress, physical health conditions, such as malaria or a brain tumour, or substance misuse. Anti-psychotic medicines are usually recommended as the first treatment, the NHS says. They work by blocking the effect of dopamine, a chemical that transmits messages in the brain. While they may reduce anxiety within a few hours, it could take several days or weeks to have an effect on symptoms such as hallucinations.\n\nWriting in the journal BMJ Case Reports, Dr Katshu added: 'His wife reported that since the EU referendum results were declared on 24 June 2016, he started spending more time putting his thoughts across on social media.\n\n'He found it difficult to reconcile with the political events happening around him. He became increasingly worried about racial incidents.\n\n'His sleep deteriorated.'\n\nThe man became agitated in hospital and attempted to dig through the hospital floor to 'get the hell out of this place'.\n\nThe patient believed he was being spied on and that talks on the radio were directed at him.\n\nDr Katshu, a consultant psychiatrist and associate professor at the University of Nottingham, said political events could act as 'major psychological stressors'.\n\nHe wrote: 'His mental health deteriorated rapidly following the announcement of the results, with significant concerns about Brexit.\n\n'He presented as agitated, confused and thought-disordered.'\n\nThe psychiatrist also said he had 'auditory hallucinations and paranoid, referential, misidentification and bizarre delusions'.\n\nThe patient described his experiences as 'intense periods of accelerated thinking', of 'being distracted and consumed by my own thoughts', and of 'a series of theatrical episodes of which I am at the centre'.\n\nHe said: 'In one scenario I remember lying on my bed on the top floor of our house with my arms and legs spread-eagled.\n\n'I was convinced one of my wife's relatives was going to shoot a missile at me using heat-seeking technology and I wanted to provide him with the best possible target.'\n\nThe man also said he had family issues, and Dr Katshu said it was possible that \u2013 along with work-related stress \u2013 this had contributed to his illness.\n\nHe recovered within a fortnight after treatment with the anti- psychotic drug olanzapine.\n\nThe patient had experienced a similar episode 13 years previously following work-related stress.", "description": "Doctors in Nottingham had to section the man and sedate him after he was taken to hospital confused and paranoid in an episode which he described as being like daydreams.", "authors": ["Sam Blanchard Senior Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/02/00/19180186-0-image-a-28_1569972228382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
