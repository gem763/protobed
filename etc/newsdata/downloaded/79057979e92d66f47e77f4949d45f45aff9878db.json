You get films like Todd Phillips\u2019 Joker, apparently.\n\nCharles Pulliam-Moore: So. Let\u2019s talk about this piece of cinema that\u2019s had everyone very, very deeply in their feelings as of late. I\u2019m curious to hear from y\u2019all what you, I guess, came to the theatre expecting given how there was already so much Discourse\u2122 before most of us actually had a chance to see it. I feel like we all joked at one point or another that we were surprised it wasn\u2019t actually out because literally everyone had a take prepared.\n\nGermain Lussier: I had the opposite experience, Charles. I was fortunate enough to see the movie before it played any film festivals. There was just like the general positive buzz which, frankly, was surprising. And as I watched it I was captivated by it.\n\nI was interested in this character and this world and then things just started to feel wrong. Like, I was feeling for this person? And this person is doing what now? So ultimately I walked out conflicted but more or less positive simply because I like when a movie makes me think or shift gears while I\u2019m watching it. I just felt like, for a movie that\u2019s trying to say so much, it really doesn\u2019t end up with one dominant theme.\n\nCharles: ????\n\nJames Whitbrook: Hahaha, I think that was a similar case for me \u2014 the sheer density of discussion coming into this movie ahead of release, I had absolutely no idea what to expect. And that\u2019s kind of what I got leaving the cinema? I still have no idea what I watched.\n\nThere is just so much going on in this movie \u2014 so much trying to go on in this movie, rather \u2014 that I don\u2019t know what it said when it wasn\u2019t bludgeoning conflicting messages over your head several times over. I didn\u2019t enjoy it, but I can\u2019t really say \u201cOh I hated what it had to say\u201d or something, because\u2026 I still don\u2019t think it actually succeeded in saying anything.\n\nAutumn Noel Kelly: I walked into the theatre with a bad feeling and left with that same bad feeling. I actually really enjoy films where I walk out thinking, \u201cWhat just happened? I need to sit in silence and really process this.\u201d I did not want to think and process this film.\n\nThere was a dominating theme for me, and that was the feeling that the filmmakers didn\u2019t really know what they wanted their movie to say. Instead, it felt like they were hiding behind the definition of a \u201ccharacter study\u201d and using that as an excuse to not talk about strong messages that were clearly there.\n\nGermain: That\u2019s interesting. We basically all agree that the movie didn\u2019t really have anything to say. My argument is that it tried to say too much and failed but either way, we seem more or less in agreement. I wonder then, did my positive spin come because I saw it before the weight of all its social and political implications came reigning down? Or am I just more the target audience, if there is one?\n\nCharles: I mean. Yes, Germain. It\u2019s OK to be a straight white guy and say you like things that non-straight white guys don\u2019t. But you have to be able to explain why you like the thing when it comes to something like Joker, and honestly, I\u2019ve yet to hear any particularly convincing defences of the movie either from the fans or anyone who\u2019s worked on it.\n\nI think you\u2019re right about the movie trying to take on too much and ultimately failing to adequately examine anything, but I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about Phillips\u2019 going on the press circuit to talk about how his plan was always to make a character study film that wouldn\u2019t have been possible to get greenlit without the comic book trappings. Without the DC larger than life fate the Joker has, what is this movie about, really?\n\nArthur\u2019s a mentally-ill, depressed man who ends up taking his rage out on a bunch of random people, and by the end of the film he\u2019s a folk hero. If Batman isn\u2019t what this film\u2019s building toward, the Joker never becomes a supervillain. He\u2019s just a terrorist and the movie really wants you to like him. I just can\u2019t fuck with that.\n\nGermain: Yeah, I totally see your point. And I will try to defend what I can (I also wrote a whole review on this, click here to read it, but for the sake of our discussion, paraphrase incoming!) but before that, I think maybe you\u2019re getting a tiny bit wrapped up in Phillips\u2019 quotes. I think this is a Joker origin story. Period, and for better or for worse. So the \u201cgoal\u201d of it is to justify something.\n\nWhat? I\u2019m not sure, and that\u2019s where our feelings start to line back up. I don\u2019t know what the point is. I do think Arthur is a dangerous anti-hero. I also think Phoenix\u2019s performance, the film\u2019s locations, settings, costumes, music, it\u2019s a very expertly crafted movie that creates a very interesting world. And in that world, exploring someone, that\u2019s what I liked about it. Trying to solve the puzzle. I just don\u2019t think there is a solution. It\u2019s a mirror on its audience and that\u2019s kind of lazy.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck. (Image: WarnerBros.)\n\nAutumn: Phoenix is a very good actor and I think if you get caught up in his performance, it would be easy to disregard some of the willful blindness in the script. At first, I did. I actually thought the story was being deliberately evasive and thought the film was going to grow with the character. I feel like Joker tried to convince audiences it was a slow progression of a very mentally ill man. But then, in the first 20 minutes, they handed Arthur a gun?!?! From there on, it felt like the film was running with the narrative, \u201cYou can\u2019t invalidate one man\u2019s personal experience.\u201d And I don\u2019t know how I feel about that in this context.\n\nCharles: Right. Like, Autumn and I saw the movie together and there were multiple moments where we both leaned over and were like \u201c...what...is happening right now?\u201d The scene where Arthur meets Sophie on the elevator plays out like a delusion, which would make a fair amount of sense if Joker actually had a solid focus on mental illness as a theme.\n\nBut because the movie gets so muddled, you end up having to watch a scene where an obviously insane white man more or less threatens to kill a black woman and then she ends up deciding to date him, and all throughout the movie you\u2019re never really given a sense that Phillips put any thought into the optics or undertones to the decisions he made during the production process.\n\nJames: I think that might ultimately be my take from the movie \u2014 I agree with Germain in that I think Phoenix gives this absolutely incredible performance as Arthur, but it feels like the movie actively seeks to undermine that performance at every conceivable level it can.\n\nIt\u2019s so discordant in its pacing and tone and even editing, cutting about the place with a reckless abandon from one idea to the next, that it felt like every time Joker came close to doing something that was... to be left open to interpretation, by its audience \u2014 whether it was a question left to linger in the air, whether it was an emotion Phoenix was conveying, the script would come banging right in and make it clear. And it was often contradictory to the last time it had done it a few scenes ago.\n\nThe stuff with Sophie felt a lot like that \u2014 like, you\u2019re meant to think throughout that thread of the movie whether or not it\u2019s a delusion of Arthur\u2019s mind or if it\u2019s some sort of fucked up kindred spirit kind of thing that blossoms into an actual support structure for his descent\u2026 and then when it comes to the reveal that yes, it\u2019s in his head, it\u2019s not left understated.\n\nThe movie just plays a montage of all the times you\u2019re meant to have got that it wasn\u2019t real. There\u2019s not a single theme or subtext left to hang for the audience to latch on to at any point in the film, so it just constantly undermines any attempt to evoke a coherent thought.\n\nGermain: I think lots of what you are all talking about comes down to Todd Phillips as a director. Walking out of the movie I thought of The Wolf of Wall Street. That\u2019s a movie where the characters are awful people, you know they are awful, you hate them, and yet because Martin Scorsese is so good, you can still enjoy that.\n\nPhillips in no way has that deft of a touch. I think Joker is overly, prohibitively ambitious from a thematic standpoint and he just didn\u2019t have the ability to convey to the audience anything about Arthur other than sympathy. Even when he\u2019s literally killing people, there\u2019s still this undercurrent of catharsis we feel because we\u2019ve seen him go through so much. And ultimately that undercuts a lot of what I think the movie could have said about the mind of a villain.\n\nWhich, again, doesn\u2019t excuse it, but I think explains it. The dude who made The Hangover movies was going to have a hard time riding that line and while I respect the effort, I think he missed the mark.\n\nAutumn: The problem for me is, I don\u2019t have sympathy for him. Sophie, and all the supporting characters in this film, were hard for me to watch because every time I saw one of them I wished I didn\u2019t have to watch a story about Arthur. That scene where he shows up at Sophie\u2019s door out of nowhere to hook up was a deplorable scene for me to watch. Who in their right mind thought that was ok? Not to mention the second time he shows up...\n\nThe only thing that was really connecting me to Arthur was his relationship with his mother. I loved seeing the two of them together in that apartment for the first half. The scene where he is helping her in the bath and they are lying in bed together watching TV. That was real to me. And ultimately, the film just disposed of her carelessly too.\n\nZazie Beetz as Sophie. (Image: Warner Bros.)\n\nJames: That\u2019s the thing though: What does Joker actually want you to think of the Joker by the time he\u2019s stomping out of that psych eval with bloodied feet? Is he this populist, antifa, and anti capitalist scion? Is he a dangerous, murderous evil? Is he a mentally traumatised victim to be understood? Hell, it can\u2019t even decide if he\u2019s actually a hero or a villain.\n\nCharles: It\u2019s trying to say all of those things, but because the movie tries to tap into so much of the real world and current discussions about things like police brutality, the resistance to the fascistic right in the U.S., and \u2014 god helps us \u2014 fucking incels, the final product is this homunculus of a movie that ultimately frames Arthur as a hero.\n\nGermain: Autumn brings up an interesting question there. Did you feel sympathy for him? Like, the movie starts with him getting jumped for no reason. We see him get bullied, made fun of, ridiculed and more. All of that made me feel sympathy and yet, it seems like maybe I was on my own there. What about you all?\n\nCharles: I think one of the messier aspects of the movie is how it does push you to sympathise for Arthur for the first two thirds, especially in the context of his being a person who needs public health care services that end up being taken away because of Gotham\u2019s political shifts.\n\nIn the moments where we see Arthur getting subpar therapy that isn\u2019t really designed to help address his needs, we\u2019re meant to see Gotham as having failed to provide its most at-risk citizens the kind of basic social safety net that, in theory, would prevent all sorts of social issues including, but not limited to, becoming a supervillain.\n\nBut as the movie goes on, Arthur becomes less and less of a man really suffering, I think? After he murders the Wall Street bros on the train, you start to see a lot of his ticks and anxiety almost fade away and you get the sense that, like, he\u2019s a person who never could have been helped. There\u2019s another version of this movie that uses the dissonance between those two versions of Arthur in a more fascinating way, but Joker, to me, just fell short of doing anything more than deciding to make Arthur \u201ccool\u201d in order to move the film towards its climax.\n\nGermain: Yeah that\u2019s the delicate balance I was talking about that the movie lacks. There\u2019s probably a way for us to start sympathizing and then slowly start to hate and fear him. I think by the end we do fear him but those notes of sympathy are there. And even if that\u2019s not the case for anyone, how do you make a person we now sympathise with and know, a full-blown supervillain?\n\nIf Batman did meet Arthur Fleck\u2019s Joker, wouldn\u2019t the thought run through your mind of \u201cOh, don\u2019t beat that guy, he always got beat up?\u201d Or something. It\u2019s just not a productive place to end for any reason.\n\nDamnit why are you all making me like this movie less. I liked it! I thought!\n\nAutumn: Charles, I think you articulated my sentiment beautifully. I wanted to sympathise. When Arthur asked to increase his medication because he just wants to be happy, and the therapist said, \u201cYou\u2019re already on seven.\u201d When all of that gets taken away later in the film, and you know, he turns into a madman, I couldn\u2019t help but think, what about the people this actually happens to in real life? How would they feel about this moment? I found the lack of consideration for reality in moments like that to be particularly concerning.\n\nJames: What compounded a lot of my moments of whether or not we should be feeling sympathy for Arthur also came down to the audience I saw the movie with. I agree that, by the climax of the movie, the film itself has mostly lost interest in attempting to get you to sympathise with Arthur from the standpoint of him being a person suffering mental illness being failed by a political support system, but in the run up to that discarding, there were several points of Arthur at his lowest moments where my audience straight up laughed.\n\nLike, not with Arthur, but at him \u2014 the moment where he drops the gun at the kids hospital was received like a gag bit and not something completely horrifying. The moment after he walks into the hospital door after being questioned by the police, after his mother\u2019s just had a stroke (and at this point you\u2019re still meant to feel like he has this sympathetic bond with her, before, you know, she\u2019s casually disregarded via pillow), too. And it was just like\u2026OK, what is this movie\u2019s tonal problem that these pieces of emotional trauma and horror are met with raucous laughter?\n\nCharles: Right. And I think that with a movie like Joker, the audience is a fundamental part of the filmgoing experience because we can all sit here and ask ourselves \u201cWho is this movie for?\u201d but we all know, really. The Joker fanbase is very much a thing and I feel safe saying that your typical \u201cRelease the Snyder Cut\u201d type is who Warner Bros. had in mind as the target audience.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with liking the Joker, I think, but in the screening I first saw the movie at, I got the very distinct sense that a lot of people (who laughed and clapped at moments I thought were inappropriate) weren\u2019t engaging with what was happening on screen beyond the fact that the Joker was up there. I feel like people who actually loved and understood the Joker as a character would have issues with this movie?\n\nGermain: Joker is obviously influenced by the movies of Martin Scorsese, right? And he recently came out against Marvel movies, specifically, but really superhero movies as a whole. Which I think is interesting because Joker is an attempt at a deeper, Martin Scorsese-type movie released for an audience who don\u2019t necessarily want that movie.\n\nFor example, the fact anyone asked Todd Phillips about Robert Pattinson after that movie just proves the discourse isn\u2019t up to what this movie is aspiring to. What happens next is not the point. This is a movie that you need to watch and think about, like it or hate it. It\u2019s not a movie that needs an end-credits scene. And yet that\u2019s kind of why it was such a success, too: the success of modern superhero movies. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m rambling a bit but I think there\u2019s something interesting in a movie being a bit too elevated for its audience even though it isn\u2019t as elevated as it wants to be.\n\nCharles: \u201cInfluenced.\u201d Listen. Phillips is obviously a Taxi Driver fan, but he\u2019s a fan who apparently doesn\u2019t have anything substantive to add to the cinematic discourse surrounding the film, other than some shoddy nods to the film that appeals to a very particular type of film bro who likes to be loud online.\n\nJames: So, I can\u2019t say I agree that this is a piece of prestige cinema that\u2019s just too cerebral for the comic book movie fan, as much as Todd Phillips would like me to, because I feel like the film tries to have it both ways there (much like it does with basically any one of its messages). Because... well, I can talk about the one moment now that I did actually feel something about Joker that wasn\u2019t inherently confused: I hated \u2014 hated \u2014 that they tied all this into yet another Batman origin scene. I didn\u2019t need Crime Alley take #2907893724.\n\nI really didn\u2019t need it through the lens of \u201cOh, Bruce Wayne becomes Batman because of a Joker-inspired anti capitalist riot.\u201d And above all, it just felt like it cheapened the film, a bone thrown to comics nerds that doesn\u2019t actually have anything to say beyond \u201clook it\u2019s that thing you know.\u201d I hated it!\n\nGermain: Yeah it just didn\u2019t need it. It took away from whatever the movie was trying to say. Call it Gotham City, show the Waynes, we know what happens. You can\u2019t have it both ways.\n\nAutumn: You know I\u2019m trying to think about what I did like about the film, and I really did enjoy the moments of silence; where we are just following Phoenix were the smartest decisions. It did make me think about how hard it is to define a hero and a villain, in comics and in real life.\n\nCan you have heroic intent and be a \u201cvillain\u201d? It\u2019s complex and the film tried to go there. But for me, the final scene where he murders the host and goes on a long speech about \u201cnobody cares about me\u201d makes me really uncomfortable with calling the film elevated. Immediately after he terrorizes, everybody cares about him. Nah.\n\nCharles: Everyone on-screen cares about him and even though we see that his actions literally lead to the needless deaths of innocent people, Joker insists that we smile through it all and walk away thinking, I guess, \u201cwell now he\u2019s going on to bigger and better things as the one person alive who\u2019s capable of taking on the world\u2019s greatest detective,\u201d which just left me cold. That all being said, Frances Conroy was great. Loved seeing her on-screen, 10/10 would watch a movie about her character and her character alone.\n\nJames: I will say, given that the movie just broke a box office record \u2014 and I was personally baffled to see a queue unlike anything I\u2019ve ever seen at my local cinema trying to get into the next screening as I was leaving \u2014 it feels like an inevitability that we\u2019ll one day see Phoenix don the clown paint again for another outing.\n\nAnd for all the nothingness Joker settled on as a thesis for me, I\u2019m potentially interested to see what could become (perhaps especially so if Phillips didn\u2019t return to direct?) of this take on the character now that all this aimless navel-gazery of what the character is, isn\u2019t, could be or couldn\u2019t be, is out of the way. I want to see Phoenix get to engage with this character again in a movie that actually supports him doing so.\n\nGermain: If nothing else, I appreciate that this movie inspired such passionate emotions in all of us and a level of discourse that we don\u2019t regularly get with comic book movies. So while I\u2019m still on the positive side, all of these valid points made me think even more deeply about the film than I already have, and for that, I appreciate it and you all.\n\nCharles: ????", "description": "What do you get when a multi-million dollar corporation decides to capitalise on one of its most popular characters by centring them in a movie that taps into conversations about white domestic terrorism in the United States, incels and the ways in which folks with mental illnesses are often abandoned by society?
