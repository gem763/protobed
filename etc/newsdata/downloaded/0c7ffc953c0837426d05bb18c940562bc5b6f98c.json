REUTERS/Jose Cabezas\n\nAccording to a copy of the agreement seen by Reuters on Monday, El Salvador would assess whether to extend refuge to migrants returned by the United States.\n\nIn exchange, the United States pledged to help the poor, violence-stricken country expand its tiny asylum system.\n\nThe agreement, announced on Friday, is similar to \u201csafe third country\u201d deals the Trump administration wants with several Latin American countries traversed by growing numbers of U.S.-bound migrants, many of whom set out from Central America.\n\nGuatemala has already signed a safe third country agreement that requires asylum seekers passing through the Central American nation to seek refuge there first rather than in the United States. Guatemala\u2019s Congress has yet to ratify the deal.\n\nHonduras is in talks with the United States over the possibility of implementing a similar measure for Cuban asylum seekers.\n\nImmigration advocates have criticized the deals, saying Central American countries, from which many people flee violence, poverty and corruption, lack the capacity to process more asylum claims and cannot assure migrants\u2019 safety.\n\nThe U.S.-El Salvador deal will take effect only after details are hammered out including how to return asylum seekers to El Salvador and the number of people to be sent back, the document says.\n\nIt was unclear how such a deal would work, given that most migrants from other countries take routes that avoid crossing the small country that makes up the violent so-called Northern Triangle region along with Honduras and Guatemala.\n\nSalvadoran President Nayib Bukele, who took office in June, will be in New York along with Trump for the United Nations General Assembly. The two are slated to discuss regional security and investment in a meeting on Wednesday in addition to migration, said a statement from the Salvadoran presidency.\n\n\u201cPresident Bukele has suggested that the United States could contribute by promoting investment and job creation, so that fewer Salvadorans see the possibility of emigrating to that country as the only way out of their economic problems and lack of opportunities,\u201d the statement said.", "description": "El Salvador said on Monday its president would discuss migration with U.S. President Donald Trump this week in New York, after agreeing the United States could send back asylum seekers who cross El Salvador while journeying north.", "authors": ["Nelson Renteria", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1433125365&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M28U", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
