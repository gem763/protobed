Its candidates, moreover, will struggle to articulate what their party stands for:\n\n\u25baFamily values?

Not when the president misuses his powers for political gain.\n\n\u25baLimited government? Not when the president uses levers of power to go after the head of Amazon, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, the state of California, the auto industry, America\u2019s closest allies and many others \u2014 simply because they refuse to carry his water.\n\n\u25baConcern for conflicts of interest?
