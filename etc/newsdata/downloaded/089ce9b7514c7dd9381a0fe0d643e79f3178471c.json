Now we have a better head to head than Slovakia but you still have to capitalise on that.\n\n\u201cKieffer was a handful all night. I am really pleased with the goal and overall really pleased with his performance. He occupies the two centre-halves and he gives us a different option. He took a few knocks. It was a real competitive game. Two teams wanting to win and not taking a backwards step.\u201d\n\nIf Wales beating Slovakia had become predictable in recent years, Giggs\u2019s team selections remained anything but. However, he may finally have settled on a starting XI before the vital match against Croatia on Sunday after his players stuck to his plan diligently and delivered a mature performance.\n\nGiggs had some senior scholars such as the captain Ashley Williams at his disposal but instead opted to blood a host of freshers in this must-not-lose game in the university city of Trnava. The Charlton defender Tom Lockyer was handed a competitive debut after a run of six friendly appearances to take the total number of defensive changes to 16 in Giggs\u2019s nine competitive matches in charge. Wigan\u2019s Moore was chosen to lead the line in what proved to be an inspired selection.\n\nWales survived an early scare after Lockyer gifted possession for Marek Hamsik to set up Robert Mak, but Ethan Ampadu came to the rescue with a last-ditch block. Wales replied with a flurry of attacks that could prove crucial in the qualification race.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ethan Ampadu blocks Robert Mak\u2019s shot.

A minute later Dan James used his lightning pace to manoeuvre away from Peter Pekarik before delivering a perfect cross for Moore, who rewarded Giggs\u2019s brave selection by heading the ball back across Martin Dubravka and into the net for his first international goal.\n\nWilliams felt he should have been awarded a penalty after he was chopped down by Norbert Gyomber before James and Bale unleashed shots on target, but Wales were content to head in at half-time with a 1-0 lead.\n\nWales began the second half in the same positive fashion as the first, but their hard work was undone by a momentary lapse. Roberts thought he had cleared the danger from Pekarik\u2019s curling cross only to see Kucka advance on to the ball and unleash an unstoppable volley into the bottom corner.\n\nScotland\u2019s slender Euro 2020 automatic qualification hopes ended by Russia Read more\n\nThe equaliser seemed to drain the positivity within the Wales ranks as the hosts pressed for a second. Wayne Hennessey had to react at full stretch to deny Albert Rusnak\u2019s low drive before Kucka went within inches of scoring a second.\n\nJoe Rodon diverted a James free-kick towards goal but was denied by a crucial intervention from Gyomber as the game entered the final 10 minutes. The Slovakia defender was sent off for a second yellow card three minutes from time to give Wales hope of snatching a winner but in the end they will see the draw as a point gained heading into key games against Croatia and, next month, Azerbaijan and Hungary.", "description": "Kieffer Moore, a former lifeguard, gave Wales a first-half lead against Slovakia, who had a player sent off late on in the 1-1 draw", "authors": ["James Candy At The City Arena Trnava"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c90e959888dea9e821cd3d8d781b91be8e603fc2/0_162_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5c8bc52e605d8fa9f7338717aea50476", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
