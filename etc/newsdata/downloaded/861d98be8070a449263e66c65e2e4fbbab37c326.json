It was spotted going up and down Nathan Road several times, firing randomly at groups of bystanders and journalists.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why dye was sprayed on the religious building, as there were not many people around,\u201d said Mohammed Sadeque, 34, who came from Kolkata to settle in the city 12 years ago. But he appreciated fellow Hongkongers who helped to clean up the coloured mess afterwards.\n\nThe Civil Human Rights Front, which applied for the march today but failed, condemned police\u2019s use of a water cannon on the mosque, calling the action \u201ctotally unnecessary\u201d as there were only \u201ca few people\u201d nearby.\n\nHong Kong Unison, which reported that some of its members were doused in the dye and injured while safeguarding the mosque, issued a statement saying it was \u201coutraged by police's unjustifiable and rash action\u201d.\n\nVolunteers help clean up the Kowloon Mosque in Tsim Sha Tsui, after the police water cannon sprayed the building with its blue dyed water to disperse surrounding anti-government protestors at an illegal march.

It was unclear whether there was an apology.\n\nDemonstrators kicked off the illegal march in Tsim Sha Tsui peacefully but the initial calm dissipated in less than two hours as some protesters began blocking roads and throwing bricks and petrol bombs.\n\nSecondary students rally at HKU to protest mask ban\n\nArson attacks began from around 3pm and lasted for more than eight hours as they set off fires inside mainland-linked businesses and police and metro stations, before gutting a Xiaomi shop and Chinese medicine store Tong Ren Tang in Mong Kok.\n\nThe tens of thousands of protesters began their illegal march equipped with banners and umbrellas from Salisbury Garden in the shopping district of Tsim Sha Tsui towards the West Kowloon terminus of the high-speed rail link, which was heavily guarded by police.\n\nBut before long, the protesters headed north all the way to Sham Shui Po along Canton Road and Nathan Road, as radicals forced open the shutters of shops and banks with mainland links and began trashing them and setting fires to several of them, including a Bank of China outlet.\n\nApart from the branches of Best Mart 360 \u2013 which has been target of vandalism after being accused of having ties with the \u201cFujian gangs\u201d that had allegedly beaten protesters in the past \u2013 the Mong Kok branch of Chinese medicine group Tong Ren Tang was also smashed and its medicine cabinets ransacked. Protesters later returned to the medicine store to set it on fire.\n\nMasked anti-government protesters set stores on fire.

What do protesters want?\n\nThey then threw petrol bombs inside at least four metro stations through their closed exits \u2013 forcing the partial suspension of Tsuen Wan line and the closure of at least 14 stations. The city\u2019s railway operator MTR has been the target of protesters who accused the operator of aiding the police\u2019s clearance actions.\n\nBy evening, a bomb disposal robot \u2013 believed to be deployed for the first time during the four-month protests \u2013 had also detonated a suspected explosive device inside a cardboard box placed at the intersection of Lai Chi Kok Road and Tong Mi Road in Tai Kok Tsui.\n\nThe marauding protesters also set a traffic light controller ablaze, apart from the fires they started in the shops the broke into.\n\nPolice deployed a robot to dispose of a suspected bomb placed on Lai Chi Kok Road in Prince Edward.

As they retreated, protesters threw bricks at their vehicles, breaking the windows. Police then returned to clash again with the mob, before retreating yet again.\n\nFigo Chan Ho-wun, the vice-convenor of the front who pushed ahead the banned march alongside three pan-democrats in their personal capacity, claimed an estimated 350,000 people had taken part in it.\n\nA glossary of terms from the protests\n\nA 25-year old frontline protester, surnamed Tang, said protesters had resorted to more violent behaviour because peaceful protests had not worked.\n\n\u201cCarrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor just won\u2019t listen,\u201d the banking staffer said, referring to the city\u2019s chief. \u201cWe must continue with our fight.\u201d\n\nIn a statement released just before midnight, the Hong Kong government strongly condemned the acts of \u201crioters who completely disregard law and order\u201d.", "description": "Several mainland-China linked businesses were vandalised and set on fire by demonstrators as the protests kicked off their 20th week.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/7502df08-f33f-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39imagehires073452.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
