Zelenskiy agreed to Trump's requests. The aid was later provided.\n\n\"I was concerned by the call,\" Vindman said in his prepared opening statement to the three House committees conducting the inquiry. \"I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government's support of Ukraine.\"\n\n\"I realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma, it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained. This would all undermine U.S. national security,\" Vindman added.\n\nTrump has denied any wrongdoing in his dealings with Ukraine and has called the impeachment probe politically motivated.\n\nVindman's testimony was some of the most damaging to date for Trump, who faces the possibility of impeachment as he prepares to run for re-election. Biden is a leading contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination to face him.\n\nFederal law prohibits candidates from accepting foreign help in an election.\n\nVindman, appearing after receiving a subpoena from lawmakers despite the Trump administration policy of not cooperating with the impeachment inquiry, recounted listening in on the call in the White House Situation Room with colleagues from the National Security Council and Vice President Mike Pence's office.\n\nAfter the call, Vindman said he reported his concerns to the National Security Council's lead counsel.\n\nVindman said earlier in July he had also reported concerns about previous pressure by the administration on Ukraine to carry out politically motivated investigations to the lawyer.\n\n\n\n\n\nA PIVOTAL MEETING\n\nVindman also called into question the truthfulness of earlier testimony by another administration official, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland.\n\nAt a July 10 meeting in Washington with visiting Ukrainian officials, Vindman said Sondland, a former Trump political donor, told the Ukrainian officials they needed to \"deliver specific investigations in order to secure a meeting with the president.\" At that point, Vindman said, then-national security adviser John Bolton cut the meeting short.\n\nAccording to Vindman's opening statement, Sondland told other U.S. officials in a debriefing after the meeting that it was important that the Ukrainian investigations center on the 2016 election, the Bidens and Burisma.\n\n\"I stated to Amb. Sondland that his statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security,\" Vindman said.", "description": "A White House official testified on Tuesday he was so alarmed by hearing U.S. President Donald Trump ask Ukraine's president to investigate a political rival, Democrat Joe Biden, that he reported the matter to a White House lawyer.
