But with an \"impeachment inquiry\" sucking up all of the media oxygen, Democrats are having a hard time making their case and voters are already sick of the political posturing.\n\nIn Michigan, a usually solid blue state President Trump won by 10,704 votes in 2016, union members are switching their votes from former Vice President Joe Biden back to Trump.
