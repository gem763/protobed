For years, Democrats have insisted that \u201cnobody is coming for your guns,\u201d and they have used that line to explain why their coveted registry and desired licensing systems do not pose a threat to anyone but criminals.

With his \u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15\u201d language, O\u2019Rourke has abandoned even that. And for what? So that he might increase a few percentage points in a poll that he is never, ever going to win, and then disappear from electoral politics forever?", "description": "", "authors": ["Charles Cooke", "Nationalreview.Com Corner Beto-Is-A-Disaster-For-The-Gun-Control-Movement"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
