I still use Apple Pay to tap in on buses and trains \u2014 I\u2019m not going to seek revenge against the digital revolution just because it stung me.\n\n\"But I have now invested in a portable charger. I must stop forgetting to charge it.\"", "description": "Blogger Jemima Kelly's upcoming trip to the US was cancelled because she couldn't get a visa following her fare dodging conviction", "authors": ["Matthew Dresch", "Image", "Facebook", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20574234.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Bus-passenger-slapped-with-\u00a3476-fine-when-iPhone-battery-died-and-couldnt-prove-shed-paid-\u00a3150-fa.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
