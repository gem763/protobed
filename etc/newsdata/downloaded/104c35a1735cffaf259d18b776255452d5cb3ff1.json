And not all evangelical supporters have taken issue with Mr. Trump\u2019s decision. Robert Jeffress, pastor of First Baptist Dallas and a prominent supporter of Mr. Trump, said he \u201chappily\u201d deferred to the commander in chief, and he praised Mr. Trump for carrying through on a campaign promise to end American involvement in Middle Eastern conflicts.\n\n\u201cSome evangelicals may disagree with the president\u2019s decision,\u201d Mr. Jeffress said, \u201cbut I guarantee you there is not one evangelical supporter of the president who would switch their vote and support Elizabeth Warren or Joe Biden over a Syria decision.\u201d\n\nFranklin Graham stopped short of condemning Mr. Trump\u2019s policy outright. The evangelist said he communicated with the president or vice president \u2014 he would not specify which leader \u2014 about the troop withdrawal within the last 48 hours, and said he ultimately deferred to their determinations. He declined to give specifics of his conversation.\n\n\u201cThere are so many other issues at stake here,\u201d he said, listing things such as Turkey\u2019s membership in NATO and U.S. military bases in the country. \u201cIt is a very hard decision.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Evangelicals-Syria-Trump-Criticism.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
