A peak of 5.7million watched their win over Scotland on ITV.\n\nThe figure in Japan - to be revealed on Wednesday - is expected to be 10 times that, meaning half the country tuned in!\n\nAround 50 million Japanese people were thought to have watched Japan's win over Scotland\n\nIn the wonderful world of Japanese hotels Wales might have lost their first choice accommodation to England for quarter-final week, but reckon they have lucked out.\n\nAll teams drew lots before the tournament to determine who would get to choose their preferred spot for the knockouts in each city. Pool winners take priority - and so with England and Wales both playing in Oita this weekend England's luck-of-the-draw pick saw them ranked higher than their cross-border rivals.\n\nSo they are staying in the hotel Wales were in last week - which has a full arcade and bowling alley - whereas Wales are in a more tranquil spot up the coast.\n\nAnd the Welsh are happier for it - their swimming pool where the players underwent recovery swims on Monday overlooks the sea and it's a far calmer location. Of course, it has the mandatory bridal shop, though!\n\nWales have moved hotels and believe they have lucked out with a calm location\n\n'The Tongan Tor' Australian hooker Tolu Latu hammered a press conference questioner for asking about coach Michael Cheika's character.\n\nSmiling, he said: 'For us, it comes across as a stupid question so that's why we're all laughing.\n\n'Obviously, you're asking us a question that we think is a complete joke, so if you're going to ask us questions like that, we'll take it as a joke, and throw it back at you.'\n\nAustralia hooker Tolu Latu was left unimpressed by a question during a press conference\n\nWith 12 teams now on their way home from the World Cup the Japanese have sent them home with a message.\n\n'To our fellow rugby players and friends,' it read.\n\n'Thank you for showing everyone here in Japan what a great sport rugby is.'", "description": "WORLD CUP DIARY: Johnny Sexton was as combative off the field as he is on it on Monday, questioning the media coverage of Ireland's World Cup.", "authors": ["Will Kelleher For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/21/19708552-0-image-a-37_1571083626198.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
