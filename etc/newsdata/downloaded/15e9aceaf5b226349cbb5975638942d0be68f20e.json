A car pulled across the taxi blocking its way.\n\n\"Two masked men got out. One with a shotgun. Inside the taxi were two members of staff from a company escorting a former prisoner to an approved accommodation, the prisoner, who had just been released, and the driver of the taxi.\n\n\"The former prisoner was being moved to a half way house. He was being escorted to it as he was deemed a high risk.\n\n\"It was very frightening for the staff and the taxi driver. The men looked inside the taxi - apparently to check the identity of the former prisoner - then backed off, and got back in their car and drove off. The assumption is that he was not the man they were after.\"\n\nIt is understood the incident happened opposite a service road which leads to and from the prison.\n\nBosses at the prison were alerted immediately after the incident in case the kidnappers' true target was about to leave.\n\nMatt Spencer, Director at HMP Forest Bank, said: \u201cI can confirm an incident occurred this morning outside HMP Forest Bank but it would be inappropriate to comment further while a police investigation is underway.\u201d\n\nIn a statement GMP said: \"At around 10.26am this morning (Tuesday 29 October 2019), police were called to reports of suspicious circumstances at HMP Forest Bank, Swinton.\n\n\"Initial enquiries have established that four men \u2013 at least two of which were armed with guns \u2013 surrounded a vehicle as it left the premises.\n\n\"After approaching the vehicle, the men made off.\n\n\"No injuries were reported to police and no arrests have been made.\n\n\"Enquiries are ongoing.\"", "description": "Police are investigating after four men, two armed with guns, targeted a taxi outside", "authors": ["Neal Keeling"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20752862.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Masked-kidnappers.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
