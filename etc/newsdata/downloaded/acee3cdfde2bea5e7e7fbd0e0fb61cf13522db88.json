There must have been many British soldiers who obeyed orders at Passchendaele [Britain\u2019s most controversial first world war battle] although convinced they were wrongly conceived.\u201d\n\nPhilby gave the confession to his friend, MI6 intelligence officer Nicholas Elliott in Beirut, almost 30 years after his recruitment in Regent\u2019s Park in 1934. MI5 wanted to send its own interrogator to confront Philby but MI6 believed the double agent would be more likely to open up to an old colleague. The extracts, published on Tuesday, begin with the rendezvous in the London park, with the man who would become Philby\u2019s handler, Arnold Deutsch, known to the Briton only as \u201cOtto\u201d.\n\nPhilby was the son of a British empire official and privately educated before attending Cambridge University. He said Deutsch told him that \u201ca person with my family background and sensibilities could do far more for communism than the run-of-the-mill party member or sympathiser\u201d.\n\nSpy Kim Philby died disillusioned with communism Read more\n\nPhilby was the most successful of the British communists who spied for Moscow, known as the Cambridge Five. He revealed in the confession that one of his first tasks was to identify fellow Cambridge communists and after he presented a list, Deutsch and another Soviet spy, introduced to him as \u201cBig Bill\u201d, settled on Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean as potential recruits.\n\nPhilby said: \u201cI was in favour of recruiting Donald, but entered strong reservations with regard to Guy, on the grounds of his unreliability and indiscretion.\u201d However, he went on to say that he was overruled and Burgess \u201cmade no more difficulty\u201d than Maclean.\n\nIn 1951, both would defect to the Soviet Union, after a tip-off from Philby that they were under suspicion.\n\nThe confession extracts end with Philby\u2019s account of the last time he saw \u201cOtto\u201d, when his handler, who would be replaced by \u201cTheo\u201d, discarded his normal security precautions to call him at home and inform him he was coming round.\n\n\u201cHe arrived in a state of great agitation with a suitcase,\u201d said Philby. \u201cHe used my telephone to book an air passage to Paris, and left the following morning. I never saw him again.\u201d\n\nHandwritten notes on the confession say this incident took place in 1936, although elsewhere in the files Deutsch is recorded as leaving the country the following year. Philby was under suspicion from 1951 but was protected by a mixture of incompetence and incredulity that he could be guilty.\n\nIn 1963, Elliott confronted Philby, who was by then working as a journalist in Lebanon and had been officially cleared of spying in 1955, to offer him immunity from prosecution if he returned to London and provided a full confession. Instead, Philby stalled, providing small pieces of information before defecting onboard a Soviet freighter on 23 January 1963.\n\nGiven the huge embarrassment MI6 and the Foreign Office would have sustained if it became known Philby was a spy, some believe he may have been allowed or even encouraged to flee.\n\nBy contrast, for Deutsch, the recruitment of Philby and the other members of the Magnificent Five (Burgess, Maclean, Anthony Blunt and John Cairncross) was his most celebrated achievement.\n\nThe files reveal that Philby\u2019s handler tried to use the connection of his cousin, Oscar Deutsch, the millionaire owner of the Odeon cinema chain, as cover for his work for Soviet intelligence work, while in the UK.\n\nHis cousin, probably unaware of his intelligence role, told the Home Office in 1936 that he wanted to employ Arnold Deutsch at a salary of \u00a3250 as an \u201cindustrial psychologist\u201d, noting that he had \u201cmade an intensive study of psychology in relation to the cinema\u201d.\n\nThe post was described as investigating among other things the \u201cpopularity of certain types of films\u201d. But the file notes that Arnold Deutsch\u2019s application was rejected on the basis that a qualified British psychologist could easily be found, \u201ctherefore it was not considered that the employment of the alien should be recommended\u201d.", "description": "Double agent Kim Philby\u2019s confession partially released to National Archives", "authors": ["Haroon Siddique"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cec92162e444b3f08c291d7342481a07322abf73/0_76_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=78e6a5110a7941e96c390d498c2fcd5a", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
