And this is where we need to focus our anger!\n\n'The only way to convince these firms and governments to change direction is by non-violent, mass political disruption, which is why I fully support the efforts of Extinction Rebellion.\n\n'Am I a hypocrite? Yes, probably, but does that mean I should just sit back and watch as the planet slowly boils to death?'\n\nLowe is pictured posing alongside a private jet. She has recently jetted off to Greece and Milan\n\nPictures on her social media channels show she has recently taken advantage of private planes to jet off on luxury holidays.\n\nIn the last three months the 30-year-old model has also posted pictures of luxury holidays in Paxos, Greece with her mother Pearl Lowe and father, singer Danny Goffey.\n\nAnother trip to Corfu was sponsored by a high-end travel firm Globe and Trotter, which describes themselves as: 'a luxury hospitality agency specialising in international public relations, photography, and brand experiences'.\n\nWhen Lowe flew to Milan in February 2017 she bragged to her 350,000 Instagram followers: 'Leaving on a jet plane! @jetsmarter.'\n\nShe then followed it up with another similar snap of her in front of the jet on the tarmac.\n\nOn Sunday night Lowe hosted an Extinction Rebellion dinner attended by former Spice Girl Mel B and XR activist Tamsin Omond\n\nJetSmarter, which has now rebranded as FlyXO, charge around \u00a35,000 for a chartered flight from London to Italy.\n\nHer friend, TV producer Emily Ann Sonnet, who was also at Monday's protests, has recently been pictured jetting off to stay in Soho House in Malibu and the Shangri-La in Mauritius.\n\nHer other friend Jaimie, who is the daughter of actor Ray Winstone, also went on a \u00a3100,000 holiday with other celebrity pals to celebrate model Cara Delevingne's 25th birthday in Mexico in 2017.\n\nWinstone and nearly a dozen others were photographed waiting to board their private jet to Mexico, with the actress also posing at the wheel of a speedboat.\n\nJaimie has also taken advantage of the high life by flying by private plane to spend a mini-holiday with her father at the Toronto film festival in 2010.\n\nShe said at the time: 'I arrived on a private jet, that was a bit insane, that was a moment.'\n\nHer friend Jaime, who is the daughter of actor Ray Winstone, went on a \u00a3100,000 holiday with other celebrity pals to celebrate model Cara Delevingne's 25th birthday in Mexico in 2017\n\nOn the eve of the first day of protests, Lowe hosted an Extinction Rebellion dinner attended by former Spice Girl Mel B and XR activist Tamsin Omond, who married her fiancee Melissa amid demonstrations on Westminster Bridge Monday.\n\nThe event was sponsored by luxury candlemakers Jo Malone, whose products are believed to give off the same amount of pollution as a diesel car.\n\nOn the fifth day of mayhem in central London, Extinction Rebellion stopped BBC journalists from entering the corporation's New Broadcasting House at the top of Regent Street.\n\nThey say they are angry that BBC Radio 4's Today programme interviewed former Scotland Yard Commander Richard Walton, who previously wrote a report saying the group should be treated as 'anarchist extremists' by police.\n\nFormer counter terrorism commander Mr Walton criticised the force in July for its 'passive' and 'tolerant' response to protests in April and recommended officers adopt a 'proactive' approach to stopping the group's illegal tactics.\n\nSo far this week, more than 1,100 activists have been arrested after protests in Trafalgar Square and Whitehall, outside Government departments and at City Airport - just shy of the total arrested during the action in April.", "description": "Lowe, 30, actress Jaime Winstone, 34, and their TV producer friend Emily Ann Sonnet joined Extinction Rebellion protestors on their first day of demonstrations in London on Monday.", "authors": ["Lara Keay For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/11/19583784-0-image-a-42_1570791100363.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
