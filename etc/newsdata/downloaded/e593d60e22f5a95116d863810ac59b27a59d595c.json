His head was directly in line with mine, and I opened my eyes to see his face inches from my own, a startling apparition only partially illuminated by a little flashlight he pointed toward the floor.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHey, buddy,\u201d I whispered, my heart racing. \u201cEverything okay? You all right?\u201d\n\nHe stood there quietly for a moment, and then said: \u201cDad. Does everybody die? You, me, Mom, Dylan, Scout, everybody?\u201d\n\nThere was no fear in his voice, just intense curiosity.\n\nI\u2019m a recovering jazz pianist, market researcher and born-again atheist. This was the domain of my wife, a practicing psychotherapist and Jewish mother extraordinaire. I tried to trigger her alert system by jamming my elbow into her back. Her radar was either malfunctioning for the first time in eight years, or she was playing possum.\n\n\u201cDad!?\u201d he repeated.\n\nI had asked my mother a similar question when I was his age, when the \u201cIf I should die before I wake\u201d part of our evening prayer had suddenly loomed large. \u201cWill you and Dad die one day? Will I?\u201d I remember that moment, and her answer, as if it were yesterday. \u201cNot for a very, very long time. Don\u2019t you worry,\u201d she told me. I worried, piled into my parents\u2019 bed, and didn\u2019t sleep well for days. Dad cut the prayer from our evening repertoire.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWell, yes,\u201d I told my son. Before I could add the reassuring \u201cnot for a very, very long time,\u201d he asked a follow-up.\n\n\u201cEverybody? Even worms?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d I realized that adding the addendum about \u201ca very long time\u201d no longer made sense. I pivoted to the \u201cdon\u2019t worry\u201d clause when he asked, \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\n\nHoping for a prompt, I nudged my wife a second time. Still no reception.\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s a difficult question. It\u2019s not like saying that two and two equals four, or that your favorite color is red, or . . .\u201d\n\nHe cut me off. \u201cSo you don\u2019t know?\u201d\n\nI had been briefed and had a whole script prepared for \u201cWhere do babies come from,\u201d but nothing on mortality. With an apologetic shrug, I told him that no, I didn\u2019t know. Thinking that additional clarification might ease the blow, I added, \u201cNo one really knows.\u201d Our dog and my allegedly sleeping wife both groaned.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI tried to regroup. I knew we were at a pivotal moment at the nexus of faith, family and the meaning of life. This was a time for a father to shine.\n\nWe locked eyes, each of us deep in thought, until he broke the silence.\n\n\u201cCan I have some ice cream?\u201d\n\nMint chip being the better part of valor, I picked him up and carried him back to bed. Then, making an exception because of the gravity of the conversation, I brought him a bowl of ice cream and a glass of water.\n\n\u201cYou okay? You want to talk about it?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo thanks.\u201d Then, as if reassuring me, he added, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Dad, nobody knows.\u201d\n\nHe handed me the empty bowl and then asked for what he called a \u201cshort sleep.\u201d I had lain down next to him, and in seconds, he was back to his dreams.\n\nAD\n\nI climbed back into my own bed. My wife asked if our son was okay. I told her how he had faced the haunting question of mortality. I mentioned that my answers may not have been textbook and looked at her with an expression similar to the one my son had given me.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d she said. \u201cYou did good.\u201d\n\nI lamented that in between \u201ceverybody dies, nobody knows\u201d and the ice cream, I hadn\u2019t woven in the part about all of us being around for a very long time.\n\nShe added, \u201cYou were there for him.\u201d\n\nIf I have learned anything in 20 years of parenting, it was that: Above all else, just be there. And a little ice cream never hurts.\n\nEdward Manning is a freelance writer and recovering jazz pianist living in New York.\n\nFollow On Parenting on Facebook for more essays, news and updates, and join our discussion group here to talk about parenting and work.
