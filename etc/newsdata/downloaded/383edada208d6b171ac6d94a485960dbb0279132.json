This capacity will be upgraded by April or May next year, Li said.\n\nThe company also plans to set up 67 lead-acid battery collection and storage stations in six Chinese provinces, including Henan, Shaanxi and Shanxi, to form a social recycling network, Li said in a presentation to the conference.\n\nAround 10 are already in operation.\n\n\u201cWe want to gradually form a perfect secondary recycling usage industrial chain,\u201d Li said.\n\nChina\u2019s environment ministry in January said it aimed to raise the collection rate of lead-acid batteries for recycling to 70% by 2025, from an estimate below 30% in 2017.\n\nThe ministry said preferential tax policies would be offered to firms that produce recycled lead from waste batteries.", "description": "Henan Yuguang Gold and Lead <600531.SS>, China's largest lead producer, plans to set up a lead-acid battery production line as part of a downstream expansion, a company official said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Tom Daly", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
