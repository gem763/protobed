The Vibram\u2019s Arctic Grip\u2122 and Ice Trek rubber compounds are also pinnacle cold weather technologies specifically built for traction on frozen surfaces.\n\nKeen Terrador Ankle Waterproof Boots, $150 at Keen: Keen believes that being active is a mindset\u2014that a change of seasons only means a change of shoes. And its Terradora Ankle Waterproof boots might be the shoes you need to survive the elements on the trail. A KEEN.DRY breathable membrane, a higher-traction outsole, and a low-density EVA midsole make for a hiking boot that\u2019ll carry you to the summit. For added comfort, a thermal heat-shield footbed retains warmth without holding onto odor (probiotic technology naturally breaks down the odor in your sweat without any heavy metals or hazardous chemicals).\n\nTecnica Forge 5 GTX, $270 at Paragon Sports: Tecnica\u2019s Forge 5 GTX was intentionally designed for women embarking on long hikes. The boot is built with innovative Tecnica-specific fabric that\u2019s both resilient and elastic to conform to your foot\u2019s anatomy via thermoforming without sacrificing durability.

The boot is also equipped with a TPU torsional wishbone chassis for added support.\n\nSalomon Quest 4D GTX, $190-$230 at Backcountry: Salomon\u2019s Quest 4D GTX boots were carefully crafted to perform. The adjustable lacing system means that they\u2019ll fit snugly and support your feet in high-impact places like your toes, heel, and arch.
