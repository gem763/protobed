(AP Photo/Vincent Thian)\n\nHONG KONG (AP) \u2014 The teenager who was the first victim of police gunfire in Hong Kong\u2019s monthslong pro-democracy protests was charged Thursday with rioting and attacking police, as calls grew for the government to ban the wearing of masks to subdue rising violence in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.\n\nThe shooting of the 18-year-old Tuesday during widespread clashes marred China\u2019s National Day celebration and marked an alarming escalation in violence in the unrest that has rocked one of the world\u2019s top financial hubs since June.\n\nLocal media reported that Chief Executive Carrie Lam will hold a special Executive Council meeting on Friday to discuss a ban on masks, which have helped protesters conceal their identities, and other tough measures under a colonial-era emergency law.\n\nLam\u2019s office said it had no comment. Pro-Beijing legislator Michael Tien confirmed the meeting. Activists and some lawmakers warned that such harsh measures would only further alienate the people and could prompt a more ferocious backlash.\n\nAnger against the government has built up since Tsang Chi-kin was shot at close range after he struck a police officer with a rod.\n\nTsang was among seven people charged Thursday with rioting, which carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison. He also faces two additional counts of attacking two police officers, punishable by up to six months in prison.\n\nTsang and two others who were hospitalized did not appear in court. The government said Tsang\u2019s condition is stable. Dozens of supporters, many in black, sat outside the courthouse.\n\nThousands of people rallied in several areas Thursday night for a second straight day to demand police accountability for the shooting. Dozens stuck anti-police posters and well-wishes for Tsang on fencing outside his school in Tsuen Wan district in the north.\n\nIn the Taikoo Shing area, riot police fired volleys of tear gas after some protesters set up road barriers and smashed a surveillance camera at a subway exit. Hundreds of people earlier shouted abuse at riot police, who used pepper spray and detained at least two people.\n\nEarlier Thursday, over 1,000 students marched Thursday at the Chinese University. Many people felt that firing at Tsang's chest, close to his heart, was an attempt to kill him.\n\nPolice defended the shooting as \u201creasonable and lawful\u201d because the officer had feared for his life and those of his colleagues.\n\nVideos on social media of the shooting showed a group of black-clad protesters with bars and umbrellas clashing with police. They closed in on a lone officer, who opened fire as Tsang came at him with a rod. Just as another protester rushed in to try to drag Tsang away but was tackled by an officer, a gasoline bomb landed in the middle of the group of officers in an explosion of flames.\n\nThe protests that started in June over a now-shelved extradition bill have since snowballed into an anti-China campaign amid anger over what many view as Beijing\u2019s interference in Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy that was granted when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997. More than 1,750 people have been detained so far.\n\nPolice associations and some pro-Beijing groups have called for tougher measures.\n\nThe Junior Police Officers Association, representing front-line officers, said the force has been stretched thin. In a statement Wednesday, it urged the government to impose a curfew and other emergency measures to maintain public order.\n\nA pro-government group, including lawmakers and lawyers, said Thursday that authorities should use the example of a Canadian law that imposes a jail sentence of up to 10 years on anyone wearing a mask during a riot or unlawful assembly.\n\nLawmaker Elizabeth Quat said the ban would specifically target rioters and wouldn\u2019t curb citizens\u2019 freedom of assembly. While it wouldn\u2019t bring protests to a halt, she said it would help reduce the violence that has wracked the territory.\n\nBut Ip Kin-yuen, a legislator representing the education sector, warned it would be akin to \u201cadding oil to the fire\u201d and could further weaken the government in dealing with the crisis.\n\nLegislator Tien said protesters could challenge a mask ban and any curfew order, just as tens of thousands of people have defied police bans on rallies and taken to the streets in the past months.\n\nBut he said it could work if the government also responds to at least the key demand of the protesters, which is to hold an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality.\n\n\u201cThey need to use carrot and stick at the same time,\u201d Tien said.", "description": "The teenager who was the first victim of police gunfire in Hong Kong\u2019s monthslong pro-democracy protests was charged Thursday with rioting and attacking police, as calls grew for the government to ban the wearing of masks to subdue rising violence in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.
