Cannonier stuffed him on his first attempt, but Hermansson eventually secured a takedown and landed with back control.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nCannonier eventually scrambled out and to his feet, where he settled into a groove, fending off Hermansson\u2019s takedown attempts and landing some hard lead leg kicks and heavy punches.\n\nRound two began with Hermansson again shooting for the takedown, but he ate a brutal uppercut on the way in, immediately crashing to the canvas. Falling to his back, Hermansson covered up, as Cannonier dropped punch after punch until the referee stepped in and waved off the fight 27 seconds into the round.\n\nThough he was only ranked No. 9 coming into the fight, Cannonier defeated the No. 5 middleweight fighter in Hermansson. He is on a three-fight winning streak since moving to the 185-pound division, believing he is ready for a title shot.\n\n\u201cI want to thank Jack for taking this fight. He was actually fighting down in the rankings, it was a huge risk for him. He took it to me. He went for his shots like he said he was gonna do. It was an honor to be in here. I want to thank him for making me a better fighter, a better man,\u201d Cannonier said in the Octagon.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t use my mouth to let people know how I fight. Eventually, it\u2019s gonna be for the belt. It might as well be next.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nDanish fighter and Olympic Silver Medalist Mark Madsen made a lasting impression in his Octagon debut. He wasted no time getting Danilo Belluardo to the canvas, where he unloaded with elbows and punches, finishing his first UFC fight in just 72 seconds in front of his home country crowd.\n\n\u201cThe Hulk\u201d lived up to his destructive moniker, as Ion Cutelaba scored the thirteenth first-round finish of his career. Twelve of those finishes have come by way of knockout, as did his 2:35 finish of Khalil Rountree Jr. in Copenhagen.\n\nOvince Saint Preux made his case for having a submission hold renamed. He survived an early onslaught from Michal Oleksiejczuk to finish him with a Von Flue choke midway through the third round of their main card bout.\n\nThe victory marked Saint Preux\u2019s fourth time ending a fight with the Von Flue choke, more than any other fighter in UFC history. Perhaps it\u2019s time to rename the hold the Saint Preux choke.\n\nHe did it ...

Most of the prelims went to the scorecards, but Phillips didn\u2019t allow that to happen, firing away from the starting bell, and quickly laying Amedovski out cold.\n\n14 seconds!!@JohnPhillipsMMA comes out swinging and puts Amedovski away in the first round! #UFCCopenhagen pic.twitter.com/hZERFbh4wf \u2014 UFC (@ufc) September 28, 2019\n\nTRENDING > Report: Kamaru Usman and Colby Covington signed for UFC 245\n\nUFC on ESPN+ 18: Hermansson vs. Cannonier results\n\nMain Card\n\nJared Cannonier def.
