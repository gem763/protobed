Even Trump wouldn\u2019t do this.\n\nOn Sunday he tweeted a list of states that would be hit harder than anticipated by Dorian. All were on the east coast \u2014 except Alabama, which was surprised to find itself included since the latest forecasts at the time showed no risk in the Gulf. The local NWS took the unusual step of correcting the president publicly 20 minutes later in order to calm Alabamians who might have seen Trump\u2019s tweet.\n\nIn addition to Florida \u2013 South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated. Looking like one of the largest hurricanes ever. Already category 5. BE CAREFUL! GOD BLESS EVERYONE! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 1, 2019\n\nAlabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east. #alwx \u2014 NWS Birmingham (@NWSBirmingham) September 1, 2019\n\nTrump\u2019s friends in the media noted his error, and naturally he got mad and doubled down:\n\n\u2026.when in fact, under certain original scenarios, it was in fact correct that Alabama could have received some \u201churt.\u201d Always good to be prepared! But the Fake News is only interested in demeaning and belittling. Didn\u2019t play my whole sentence or statement. Bad people! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 2, 2019\n\nThe barest sliver of Alabama was included in early projections of Dorian\u2019s path but not by the time POTUS tweeted on Sunday:\n\nOvernight Friday the tiniest slice of Alabama was on the edge of the 5-day cone of uncertainty for the center of the storm. (No sharpie needed.) But by the time of the president's Alabama tweet the storm forecast had shifted well to the east. pic.twitter.com/GNwNF072d4 \u2014 Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) September 4, 2019\n\nSo \u2026 what happened at this photo op in the Oval Office this afternoon?\n\nSee the black line on the map in his hand, which conveniently covers Alabama? That\u2019s obviously not part of the official NWS map. And why is Trump bothering to show an outdated map of an earlier projection anyway? The current projections have Dorian climbing up the east coast.\n\nIt sort of looks like he got mad at the media for noting his error and decided to have an old map doctored \u2014 clumsily \u2014 to make it appear as though he was right all along about the storm reaching Alabama.\n\nReporters asked him about it following the photo op: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nREPORTER: That map you showed us today, it looked like it almost had like a Sharpie on it. TRUMP: I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know. pic.twitter.com/d2oZemOshh \u2014 JM Rieger (@RiegerReport) September 4, 2019\n\nI\u2019m open to the pro-Trump explanation because the anti-Trump explanation seems just too absurd. What is that explanation? What\u2019s with the line on the map?\n\nUpdate: The Right Scoop notes that Alabama was included in the very earliest projections of impact as of August 30 but that had long since changed by the time Trump tweeted on September 1. The fact that he (or someone else) had to draw a line on the map he displayed today suggests that the Alabama projections were so early that the NWS wasn\u2019t even making maps of the hurricane\u2019s projected landfall until after Alabama had been eliminated from the equation. If there\u2019s an NWS map showing Alabama in the storm\u2019s path, why didn\u2019t Trump just show that one? What\u2019s with the Sharpie?", "description": "Mystery.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/n.jpg"}
