Chile\u2019s biggest political crisis since the return of democracy almost 30 years ago was triggered by a 3% rise in metro fares, the protests which have engulfed and paralysed Lebanon by a proposed tax on WhatsApp calls. But the underlying causes run far deeper, and have been building for much longer. There is deep anger at political and economic systems that have ignored most of the population.\n\nThese countries are, of course, very different. Lebanon has been staggering along for years, due to both political dysfunction and endemic corruption. The central bank governor warns that its economy \u2013 long shored up by remittances from overseas \u2013 is now days away from collapse. Recently it emerged that, before he became prime minister, Saad Hariri gave $16m to a South African model: a sum encapsulating the gulf between the lives of those at the top and the rest.\n\nMeanwhile, Chile was seen as an economic success story, and its billionaire president Sebast\u00edan Pi\u00f1era had portrayed the country as an \u201coasis\u201d in a region of strife. But it is desperately unequal, a legacy of Pinochet\u2019s dictatorship and of the neoliberal settlement it bequeathed the nation \u2013 with precarious access to basic services, and the poorest fifth of the population living on less than $140 a month. So while both governments dropped the offending proposals, the movements had already outrun their initial causes. Lebanon\u2019s prime minister announced his resignation on Tuesday , though some suspect he is seeking political leverage. The Chilean president has fired hardline ministers, but protesters in Chilean cities lit fires and clashed with police following the announcements.\n\nHardline rhetoric and violence has further inflamed the public. Mr Pi\u00f1era insisted that \u201cWe are at war with a powerful and uncompromising enemy that respects nothing and no one.\u201d At least 20 have died, hundreds have been shot and beaten, and more than 7,000 arrested. In Lebanon, Hezbollah\u2019s leader, Hassan Nasrallah \u2013 who holds no formal position, yet calls so many shots \u2013 warned of foreign \u201cconspiracies\u201d inflaming the movement. When hundreds of men ransacked the main protest site on Tuesday, demonstrators blamed Hezbollah and another faction, Amal. Lebanon is used to interim governments and political chaos, but the stakes are higher as the economic strains become ever less tenable. Chile faces the real prospect of social breakdown, or a return to authoritarianism.\n\nProtest movements around the world are evolving at disorienting speed, partly thanks to technological developments and partly as they look to similar campaigns abroad. Meanwhile governments lumber along, unable to seize the initiative or even to respond at pace \u2013 not least because it is hardly in the interests of the powerful to offer the kind of fundamental concessions which will only weaken that power. But when things have reached this stage, there is no easy exit. Leaders may reach for sticks or sticking plasters, but there cannot be short-term solutions to long-term structural problems.", "description": "Editorial: Mass unrest has seized both countries.
