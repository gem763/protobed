Tom Williams | CQ-Roll Call Group | Getty Images\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Monday suggested that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff could face \"arrest for treason\" over his recent statement about Trump's call with Ukraine's president. \"Rep. Adam Schiff illegally made up a FAKE & terrible statement, pretended it to be mine as the most important part of my call to the Ukrainian President, and read it aloud to Congress and the American people,\" Trump tweeted. \"It bore NO relationship to what I said on the call. Arrest for Treason?\" he added. Neither the White House nor a spokesman for Schiff, D-Calif., immediately responded to CNBC's request for comment on the president's tweet. The fiery tweet accusing Schiff \u2014 a leading voice on the House's impeachment inquiry into Trump \u2014 of \"illegally\" misrepresenting him came days after the president said at a private staff event that \"we used to handle\" spies and treason \"a little differently than we do now.\"\n\nHe was referring to the sources used by a whistleblower, who filed a bombshell complaint last month alleging Trump was \"using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election\" by asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate rumors of wrongdoing against former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. In the same call, Zelensky had suggested Ukraine was about ready to buy weapons from the U.S. military. Trump responded, \"I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it.\" Trump appeared to be referring in that portion of the call to the origins of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe. He suggested he would have Attorney General William Barr \"call you or your people\" as part of the proposed investigation. Reporting about the complaint, which was made public last week along with a memorandum of Trump's July 25 call with Zelensky, led House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to back an impeachment inquiry into the president. Dozens of Democrats came out in favor of an inquiry as details about the call came to light. Nearly the entire House caucus now supports an impeachment inquiry. Schiff has characterized Trump's call with Zelensky as a \"classic organized crime shakedown,\" and took that analogy further in a contentious hearing Thursday with acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire.", "description": "In a hearing last week, Schiff delivered a self-described \"parody\" of Trump's call with Ukraine's president using mobster-like language.", "authors": ["Kevin Breuninger"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106155786-1569851539104gettyimages-1177250763.jpeg?v=1569851591", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
