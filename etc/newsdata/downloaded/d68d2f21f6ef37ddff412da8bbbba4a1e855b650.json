It's down to their little sister Elisa to break the spell and turn her brothers back into humans.\n\nThe task? Sew six shirts from aster flowers without speaking or laughing for six years.\n\nThere is a happy ending of course - and now kids and parents can live out the adventure for themselves.\n\n(Image: Efteling)\n\nThe Six Swans can be experienced in two ways; visitors can walk through the castle and take in the scenes, or opt to tide one of the three-metre-long swans along a small water stream.\n\nIn fact, it's the first time that the theme park has incorporated a ride into one if its attractions.\n\nIt's not all gentle attractions at the theme park; adrenaline-seekers can get their fill thanks to the thrilling rollercoasters on offer from the Baron to the Python.\n\n(Image: Efteling)\n\nWant to see it for yourself?

You can find out more on the Efteling website.\n\nThe Six Swans is the theme park's 30th attraction in the Fairytale Forest since the park first opened its doors in 1952. At the time it had just ten fairytale-themed attractions including Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood and Pinocchio.\n\nTo mark the milestone moment, the park will be hosting a temporary exhibition at the Efteling museum entirely themed around the beloved tales.\n\nFons Jurgens, CEO of Efteling, said: \"Fairytales have been the origin of Efteling since 1952. That is why we continue to enrich the Fairytale Forest with new stories. This relatively unknown fairytale is a classic - a beautiful and interactive addition that underlines our role as guardian of the fairytale.\"", "description": "Efteling theme park has unveiled its new attraction The Six Swans that's sure to be a hit with kids", "authors": ["Julie Delahaye", "Image", "Efteling"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20544067.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Efteling.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
