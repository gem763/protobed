The pilot program will offer customers perks for using the BetMGM app at select Buffalo Wild Wings locations in the state, with plans to expand the test to more states in the future.\n\n\u201cAs the largest sports bar in the country, Buffalo Wild Wings has the opportunity to pioneer sports gaming experiences for fans, and we are taking the first critical step on that journey through our partnership with BetMGM,\u201d Buffalo Wild Wings president Lyle Tick said in a statement. \u201cThis is a landmark relationship between two preeminent experience brands that puts us in a position to innovate the current sports watching experience to bring the best of sports gaming to our guests.\u201d\n\nThe partnership was announced as legal sports betting gains traction in a growing number of states. At present, 19 states have legalized sports gambling in some form, while seven have legalized mobile gaming. Nearly 40 million Americans will place a wager on an NFL game, according to a survey by the American Gaming Association.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBuffalo Wild Wings operates roughly 1,200 locations around the U.S. and has revamped its business strategy in recent months in a bid to reverse sagging sales and store traffic. The chain first confirmed its intention to pursue sports betting opportunities in August 2018.\n\nMGM has invested heavily in sports betting properties since the U.S. Supreme Court reversed a longstanding federal ban on wagers in 2017. The casino giant reached a three year, $25 million deal to serve as the NBA\u2019s official sports betting partner in July 2018 and has a similar partnership with the NFL\u2019s New York Jets.\n\nIn addition, MGM partnered with now-defunct Alliance of American Football on a sports gaming platform. The company acquired rights to AAF\u2019s gambling technology for just $125,000 in June as part of bankruptcy proceedings.\n\n\u201cOur partnership with Buffalo Wild Wings is an important development in MGM and Roar\u2019s position as the leader in sports entertainment and betting,\u201d said MGM Resorts Chairman and CEO Jim Murren. \u201cWith more than 1,200 sports bars across the country, Buffalo Wild Wings is firmly established as a \u2018go to\u2019 venue for sports viewing in all of its markets. Adding access to MGM\u2019s world class properties and the BetMGM mobile app will create unique customer experiences and redefine how fans enjoy sports.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nBuffalo Wild Wings said televisions at its restaurants will display custom sportsbook content, including live odds, at some point in the future.
