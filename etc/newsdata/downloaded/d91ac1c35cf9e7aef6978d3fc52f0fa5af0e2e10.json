Yet sometimes, investors buy a stock for its dividend and lose money because the share price falls by more than they earned in dividend payments.\n\nIn this case, Oil Company Bashneft likely looks attractive to dividend investors, given its 8.7% dividend yield and eight-year payment history. It sure looks interesting on these metrics - but there's always more to the story . When buying stocks for their dividends, you should always run through the checks below, to see if the dividend looks sustainable.\n\nExplore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Oil Company Bashneft!\n\nMISX:BANE Historical Dividend Yield, October 10th 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nCompanies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. Comparing dividend payments to a company's net profit after tax is a simple way of reality-checking whether a dividend is sustainable. In the last year, Oil Company Bashneft paid out 27% of its profit as dividends. A medium payout ratio strikes a good balance between paying dividends, and keeping enough back to invest in the business. One of the risks is that management reinvests the retained capital poorly instead of paying a higher dividend.\n\nIn addition to comparing dividends against profits, we should inspect whether the company generated enough cash to pay its dividend. Oil Company Bashneft paid out 438% of its free cash flow last year, which we think is concerning if cash flows do not improve. Paying out such a high percentage of cash flow suggests that the dividend was funded from either cash at bank or by borrowing, neither of which is desirable over the long term. While Oil Company Bashneft's dividends were covered by the company's reported profits, free cash flow is somewhat more important, so it's not great to see that the company didn't generate enough cash to pay its dividend. Were it to repeatedly pay dividends that were not well covered by cash flow, this could be a risk to Oil Company Bashneft's ability to maintain its dividend.\n\nConsider getting our latest analysis on Oil Company Bashneft's financial position here.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nBefore buying a stock for its income, we want to see if the dividends have been stable in the past, and if the company has a track record of maintaining its dividend. The first recorded dividend for Oil Company Bashneft, in the last decade, was eight years ago. It's good to see that Oil Company Bashneft has been paying a dividend for a number of years. However, the dividend has been cut at least once in the past, and we're concerned that what has been cut once, could be cut again. During the past eight-year period, the first annual payment was \u20bd213 in 2011, compared to \u20bd159 last year. The dividend has shrunk at around 3.6% a year during that period. Oil Company Bashneft's dividend has been cut sharply at least once, so it hasn't fallen by 3.6% every year, but this is a decent approximation of the long term change.\n\nWe struggle to make a case for buying Oil Company Bashneft for its dividend, given that payments have shrunk over the past eight years.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Dividend paying stocks like Public Joint Stock Oil Company Bashneft (MCX:BANE) tend to be popular with investors, and...", "authors": ["Simply Wall St"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QuYJkfexDSHAzAS.ocF_Fw--~B/aD00MzI7dz0xMTk0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/cba97727cc5bde124757318387415e9d", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
