Its biggest accomplishments so far are ending a government shutdown at the beginning of the year, and managing to avoid another one earlier this month.\n\nCongress did also clear a border spending bill that helped alleviate overcrowded conditions at Customs and Border Protection facilities.\n\nBut far more attention has been spent on pursuing investigations against Mr. Trump, with subpoenas and oversight hearings proving as popular as passing bills.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the Democrats have been preoccupied since November 2018 with overturning the results of the 2016 elections,\u201d said Mike McKenna, a strategist who advises Republicans on legislation. \u201cHate takes up a lot of mindshare and energy.\u201d\n\nMrs. Pelosi, aware of the dangers of being seen as the impeachment Congress, has spent months pleading with her lawmakers to talk about their legislative agenda rather than their investigative efforts back in their districts.\n\nShe\u2019s also sought to give them things to talk about.\n\nLast month she announced a new push to try to lower prescription drug prices by giving the federal government a broader role in negotiating the price paid. A vote is expected in coming weeks.\n\nThe legislation could shave hundreds of billions off the budget over the next decade and help bring what Americans pay for drugs in line with the rest of the world \u2014 but it could also stymy development of new drugs, the Congressional Budget Office calculated.\n\nDonald Wolfensberger, senior fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said as much as Mrs. Pelosi wants to talk legislation, she\u2019s running into a press corps far more interested in impeachment.\n\nMrs. Pelosi hasn\u2019t helped matters. When she kicked off a press conference two weeks ago she said she was there foremost to talk about bills \u2014 but she brought with her Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House intelligence committee, who at this point is spearheading her new impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s face it \u2014 the media is rather obsessed on the whole impeachment thing. That gets a lot of play,\u201d said Mr. Wolfensberger, who is the former director of the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson Center.\n\nAnd whatever legislation Democrats do pass through the House must survive the Senate, where the GOP is in control and where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has batted away Mrs. Pelosi\u2019s partisan bills.\n\nMr. Wolfensberger said it appears the Kentucky Republican is intent on making sure Mrs. Pelosi doesn\u2019t get credit for any big bills.\n\n\u201cThe House is churning out quite a few important bills but they\u2019re going nowhere in the Senate,\u201d he said.\n\nThe stalemate is all the more striking because divided government used to be when big deals got done. Welfare reform and balanced budgets emerged when the GOP held Congress and President Clinton, a Democrat, was in the White House.\n\nAnd in 1983, with Democrats in control of the House, then-Speaker Tip O\u2019Neill reached a deal with President Reagan, a Republican, to put Social Security on firm footing for decades.\n\nMr. Wolfensberger said not to expect those sorts of deals now because, for one thing, Mr. Trump isn\u2019t sending up major legislative packages to Capitol Hill.\n\nAnd Mr. McKenna offered another reason: the strained budget.\n\n\u201cMoney tends to be the lubricant of large, complex legislative deals,\u201d he said. \u201cThere really isn\u2019t much money left to spend. So it\u2019s a lot more difficult to buy off people, groups, and interests.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
