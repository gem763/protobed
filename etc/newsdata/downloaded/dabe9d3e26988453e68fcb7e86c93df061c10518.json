Further reporting indicates that the conversation amounted to a threat to withhold $250 million in military aid to Ukraine unless Zelensky investigates the family of Joe Biden, who is of course running to unseat Trump in 2020.\n\nAnd The Wall Street Journal has reported that during a single phone call in July, Trump made \u201cabout eight\u201d demands for Zelensky to work with his lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, to investigate Biden, though Trump did not mention the aid during the call. The Post reported that while there was no explicit quid pro quo during the call, that conversation is part of a broader set of facts included in the whistleblower complaint. According to the Post, a \u201cUkrainian official this year said he had no evidence of wrongdoing by Mr. Biden or his son, Hunter Biden.\u201d", "description": "The president supposedly dangled millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine in exchange for Kiev investigating Joe Biden.
