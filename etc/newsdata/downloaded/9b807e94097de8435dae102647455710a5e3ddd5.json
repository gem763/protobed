But doing so may be more difficult than it seems.\n\nOn Tuesday, the US Department of Justice opened a sweeping antitrust investigation of major technology companies and whether their online platforms have hurt competition, suppressed innovation or otherwise harmed consumers.\n\nIt said the probe will take into account \u201cwidespread concerns\u201d about social media, search engines and online retail services.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cWithout the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands,\u201d Makan Delrahim, the department's chief antitrust officer, said in a statement. \u201cThe Department's antitrust review will explore these important issues.\u201d\n\nThe terse but momentous announcement follows months of concern in Congress and elsewhere over the sway of firms like Google, Facebook and Amazon. Lawmakers and Democratic presidential candidates have called for stricter regulation or even breakups of the big tech companies , which have drawn intense scrutiny following scandals involving compromised user privacy, security lapses and misinformation and extremism that flourished on their platforms.\n\nFacebook is awaiting a significant judgment from the Federal Trade Commission over its privacy practices, one that will reportedly include a $5bn (\u00a34bn) fine and impose other limits on its operations. The FTC also reportedly plans to hand Google a multimillion dollar fine over its handling of children's information on YouTube. Europe has investigated and fined a number of major US tech companies over the past several years.\n\n\u201cIt seems like the nation's law enforcement agencies are finally waking up to the threat posed by big tech,\u201d said Stacy Mitchell of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, which has criticised Amazon for stifling independent businesses. Mitchell testified at a House hearing last week.\n\nPresident Donald Trump also has repeatedly criticised the big tech companies by name in recent months. He frequently asserts, without evidence, that they are biased against him and conservatives in general.\n\nBut Big Tech could also present a difficult target, as current interpretations of US antitrust law don't obviously apply to companies offering inexpensive goods or free online services. The Justice Department did not name specific companies in its announcement.\n\nThe Justice investigation mirrors a bipartisan probe of Big Tech undertaken by the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust. Its chairman, David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, has sharply criticised the conduct of Silicon Valley giants and said legislative or regulatory changes may be needed. He has called breaking up the companies a last resort.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Amazon and Facebook had no comment. Apple and Google referred inquiries to public statements by their executives.\n\nShares of Facebook, Amazon and Apple were down slightly in after-hours trading Tuesday.\n\nTraditional antitrust law focuses on dominant businesses that harm consumers, typically defined as price-gouging and similar behaviours. But many tech companies offer free products that are paid for by a largely invisible trade in the personal data gleaned from those services. Others like Amazon offer consistently low prices on a wide array of merchandise.\n\n\u201cThat is going to be a tough one for (regulators) to prove,\u201d said University of Pennsylvania law professor Herbert Hovenkamp.\n\nBeyond that, the companies could face scrutiny for buying up smaller rivals that might be a threat to their business. Last week, Cicilline accused industry giants of creating a \u201cstartup kill zone\u201d to insulate them from competition.\n\nFor instance, Google bought YouTube in 2006 when it was still a fledging video site struggling to survive an onslaught of copyright infringement lawsuits, and acquired the technology for its now-dominant Android software for smartphones in an even smaller deal. Facebook snapped up Instagram \u2014 now the fastest-growing part of its business \u2014 in its infancy, and Apple bought the technology powering its ubiquitous Siri assistant.\n\nThe Trump-era Justice Department has already tried to push the bounds of antitrust law, albeit unsuccessfully. The government employed a novel antitrust theory when it sued to block AT&T's acquisition of Time Warner, arguing that the combined company could hike prices for programming to consumers' detriment. It lost the case both in lower court and on appeal.\n\nIn his January confirmation hearings, Attorney General William Barr acknowledged curiosity about how Silicon Valley giants grew so huge \u201cunder the nose\u201d of antitrust enforcers. \u201cI don't' think big is necessarily bad,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I want to find out more about that dynamic.\u201d\n\nTrump has been a fierce critic of AT&T, which owns CNN, in addition to many large tech companies. At various times, he has publicly criticised Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon for allegedly shady, biased or unpatriotic behaviour.\n\nAP", "description": "Like Europe before it, the US\u00a0government looks ready to try reining in its technology giants.
