The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, by contrast, has recommended that the bond market be closed.\n\n2. China's economy is still slowing\n\nAsian markets rallied in relief at the results of U.S.-China trade talks at the end of last week, but the hard data continued to show the extent of China\u2019s problems.\n\nChinese fell at the steepest level since March in September. They dropped 3.2% on the year. fell an even steeper 8.2%, equalling their worst drop since 2016.\n\nThere was further evidence of the Chinese economy\u2019s struggles in a 5.2% annual drop in car sales, the 15th straight monthly decline. Even sales of new-energy vehicles \u2013 cars which are either wholly or partially electric-powered, fell for the third month in a row. That\u2019s due in large measure to the phasing out of subsidies for electric car purchases.\n\nOn an otherwise light day for data, the euro zone\u2019s fell by a worse-than-expected 2.8% on the year in August, despite a 0.4% monthly rebound.\n\n3. Softbank set to take over WeWork\n\nSoftbank is in talks to take control of WeWork\u2019s parent company, according to the Wall Street Journal and Financial Times, aiming to recapitalize the company at a sharply lower valuation than that which it was seeking from the public capital markets last month.\n\nThe papers reported that Softbank is also lining up billions of dollars in fresh debt from JPMorgan (NYSE: ). Both reports said that a deal wasn\u2019t guaranteed and the FT noted that if new money can\u2019t be raised, then bankruptcy proceedings may be necessary. The WSJ noted that We Co., the largest commercial tenant in some urban real estate markets, needs $3 billion to get through the next year.\n\nSoftbank is already We Co.\u2019s largest external shareholder, having invested over $10 billion in We Co. directly and through its Saudi-backed Vision Fund.\n\n4. Turkish assets falls under sanctions threat\n\nThe , and the local and bond markets, all fell sharply after both the U.S. and EU warned of imposing economic sanctions on the country if it continues its military operations in Kurdish-controlled areas of Syria.\n\nThe dollar rose as high as 5.9225 lira, the highest since June, after a weekend peppered with reports of atrocities committed and jailbreaks by Islamic State prisoners whose Kurdish guards had been redeployed to fight Turkish units.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan has counted on Turkey\u2019s significant geopolitical value to defy pressure from the West: he has threatened to reignite Europe\u2019s migrant crisis by sending 3.6 million Syrian refugees westward, while also threatening a major security realignment by buying new missile defense equipment from Russia rather than from its NATO allies.\n\n5. Not good enough, EU tells U.K. on Brexit plans\n\nThe retreated after its sharpest one-day rally in more than two years, after the EU\u2019s top negotiator Michel Barnier reportedly told EU diplomats that the U.K.\u2019s latest proposals on settling the Irish border chapter of the Brexit negotiations were unworkable.\n\nThe EU\u2019s reaction means that it\u2019s virtually impossible to agree a legally-binding withdrawal agreement at a summit due at the end of this week. As such, Prime Minister Boris Johnson will be forced under a recently passed law to ask the EU for another extension to the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline.\n\nOutgoing EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told an Austrian newspaper at the weekend that it would be \u201cunhistoric\u201d not to grant such a request.\n\nJohnson's government meanwhile is preparing for a general election: a new session of parliament opened by the Queen today will read out a laundry list of major spending promises for the time after Brexit.", "description": "Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Monday", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC302V7_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
