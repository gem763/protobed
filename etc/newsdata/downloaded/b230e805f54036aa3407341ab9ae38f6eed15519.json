And Emily Giambalvo tracks the lives of the dogs rescued from Michael Vick\u2019s dogfighting operation.\n\nPost Reports is the daily podcast from The Washington Post. Unparalleled reporting. Expert insight. Clear analysis. Everything you\u2019ve come to expect from the newsroom of The Post -- for your ears.\n\n\u2018This is a town that has seen better days\u2019\n\nIt took Congress until December 2017 to pass a bill targeting fentanyl \u2013 nearly four years after legislators first received warnings about the dangers of the drug. In that time, more than 67,000 Americans had died from overdoses from fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. And death rates are still rising.\n\n\n\n\n\nReporter Katie Zezima heard from nearly two dozen current and former members of Congress who expressed anger and exasperation that the rise of synthetic opioids drew so little action in Washington. They see Congress\u2019s failure as emblematic of a body that acts slowly and unimaginatively to America\u2019s most pressing problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIn 2018, Congress, after years of inaction, had finally passed three opioid packages to deal with the opioid crisis,\u201d Zezima says. \u201cThey freed up billions of dollars to go to communities that have been affected. But the wheels of bureaucracy turn really slowly, and places are really just starting to see the influx of money now.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTo see whether the money has made an impact, Zezima and audio producer Ted Muldoon visited Taunton, Mass., one of the first communities to feel the wave of fentanyl abuse. It\u2019s a town that has \u201cseen better days,\u201d Zezima says.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 47 dogs that made it out of Michael Vick\u2019s dogfighting ring\n\nSurvivors of Michael Vick\u2019s dogfighting operation thrive more than a decade after the former NFL quarterback pleaded guilty to running an illegal ring in southeastern Virginia.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scandal cast a spotlight on the number of dogfighting rings around the nation, and changed how dogs rescued during large-scale dogfighting busts are treated. Rather than being euthanized, Vick\u2019s dogs were given a chance to live.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSome of these major organizations spoke out and thought, \u2018Let\u2019s just try and see if these dogs could be pets,\u2019 \u201d reporter Emily Giambalvo says. \u201cThey knew that, if we change this in a public way, then we could really change how dogs from fight busts are handled in the future.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year, The Post tracked down all 47 dogs seized in the bust and documented their post-adoption lives in loving homes from California to Rhode Island.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:", "description": "Katie Zezima on why federal money has a limited impact in communities fighting the opioid crisis.
