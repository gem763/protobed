(Alexei Druzhinin/Sputnik via AP)\n\nWith Mariana Alfaro\n\nTHE BIG IDEA: The Russians keep coming.\n\nFacebook announced Monday afternoon that it took down a network of Russian-backed accounts that were posing as American voters in swing states. The social media company said the operation appeared well-resourced, reflected a sophisticated understanding of the culture wars that divide Americans, and bore all the hallmarks of the Internet Research Agency, the Kremlin-backed troll farm that interfered in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nFifty fake accounts were removed from Instagram, the photo-sharing app owned by Facebook. Only one of the accounts that was taken down was a traditional Facebook page. This reflects how America\u2019s adversaries continue to be aggressive and entrepreneurial, evolving to maximize their impact.\n\nGraphika, a social media analysis firm that examined the operation for Facebook, published a 30-page report about the fake pages, which were still in audience-building mode: \u201cMultiple accounts praised Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump. Accounts from both sides of the political spectrum attacked Joe Biden; some also attacked Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reason that networks of phony accounts are drawn to Instagram is because disinformation is increasingly visual in nature, and that\u2019s what Instagram specializes in,\u201d said Paul Barrett, deputy director of New York University\u2019s Stern Center for Business and Human Rights.\n\n\u201cThe disclosure from Facebook served as more evidence of what Trump has repeatedly questioned \u2014 that Russian actors not only interfered in the 2016 election but are continuing their efforts to interfere in American democracy,\u201d Tony Romm and Isaac Stanley-Becker report. \u201cThe task of safeguarding U.S. elections from interference by Russia and other foreign actors has been a source of tension in the Trump administration, with the president repeatedly calling the allegations of Russian involvement in 2016 a \u2018hoax\u2019 and top security officials being forced to tiptoe around the issue.\u201d\n\nFacebook\u2019s announcement comes ahead of chief executive Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s scheduled testimony before Congress on Wednesday. Lawmakers have been champing at the bit to question him about what the company is doing to safeguard U.S. elections in 2020. In an interview with The Washington Post last week, Zuckerberg said Facebook is in a \u201cmuch better place now\u201d to stop disinformation, with better artificial intelligence technology to detect nefarious activity and more staff focused on the problem. But he also said the problem posed by disinformation has worsened since 2016, and he said the U.S. government deserves part of the blame. \u201cUnfortunately, the U.S. did not have a particularly strong response to Russia after 2016 so it sent the signal to other countries that they could get in on this, too,\u201d he said.\n\nTo wit, Facebook also announced yesterday that it disabled three disinformation campaigns that originated in Iran. They were almost certainly sanctioned by the government in Tehran.\n\nMark Zuckerberg walks to a meeting in the Russell Senate Office building. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News)\n\n-- Non-state actors are pursuing innovative approaches, as well. Today\u2019s Wall Street Journal reports, for instance, that Islamic State militants have been posting short propaganda videos in recent weeks to TikTok, the social network that\u2019s popular with teenagers right now.\n\n\u201cThe videos\u2014since removed, in line with the app\u2019s policy\u2014featured corpses paraded through streets, Islamic State fighters with guns, and women who call themselves \u2018jihadist and proud,\u2019\u201d per Georgia Wells. \u201cMany were set to Islamic State songs. Some included TikTok filters, or images, of stars and hearts that stream across the screen in an apparent attempt to resonate with young people. \u2026 The app, owned by Beijing-based Bytedance Ltd., features short videos that started becoming popular in the U.S. in 2018 and has been embraced by teens. It was the third-most installed app world-wide in the first quarter, behind Facebook Inc.\u2019s WhatsApp and Messenger, and about 30% of users are under the age of 18.\u201d\n\n-- Twitter announced yesterday that it plans to create a new policy to combat manipulated media, including deep fake videos, ahead of the 2020 election. These distorted videos are increasingly realistic and lifelike. Twitter is asking for public feedback.\n\n-- It\u2019s a brave new world out there, and authoritarians keep trying to turn technological tools into instruments of oppression: The Russians passed a law earlier this year that lets Vladimir Putin take all the country\u2019s Internet traffic off the World Wide Web if he decrees that there\u2019s an \u201cemergency.\u201d The latest development is that the Putin administration now plans to hold annual exercises to prepare for such a scenario by effectively turning off the Internet.\n\n\u201cA new posting appeared October 21 on Russia\u2019s official government website to announce the exercise plans,\u201d according to Meduza, a Latvia-based online news outlet that covers the Kremlin. \u201cAn executive order allowing for the exercises will take effect on November 1. Specific arrangements to test the Russian Internet\u2019s isolation capabilities have been developed by the Communications Ministry and approved by the FSB, the Defense Ministry, the Federal Security Service, the Emergencies Ministry, and the Federal Service for Technical and Export Control.\u201d The FSB is the successor to the KGB, where Putin was once an officer.\n\n-- Bloomberg News posted a chilling story this morning about the expansion of the surveillance state in Moscow: \u201cThe fourth of 10 basic rules Western spies followed when trying to infiltrate Russia\u2019s capital during the Cold War\u2014don\u2019t look back because you\u2019re never alone\u2014is more apt than ever. Only these days it\u2019s not just foreigners who are being tracked, but all 12.6 million Muscovites, too. Officials in Moscow have spent the last few years methodically assembling one of the most comprehensive video-surveillance operations in the world. The public-private network of as many as 200,000 cameras records 1.5 billion hours of footage a year that can be accessed by 16,000 government employees, intelligence officers and law-enforcement personnel.\u201d\n\n-- The stories about disinformation efforts should be read against the backdrop of a major update in L'Affaire Ukraine: Current and former U.S. officials say that Trump\u2019s effort to pressure Ukraine for information he could use against political rivals came as he was being urged to adopt a hostile view of that country by its regional adversaries, including Putin.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s conversations with Putin, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and others reinforced his perception of Ukraine as a hopelessly corrupt country \u2014 one that Trump now also appears to believe sought to undermine him in the 2016 U.S. election\u201d Greg Miller, Greg Jaffe, John Hudson and Ellen Nakashima report. \u201cNeither of those foreign leaders specifically encouraged Trump to see Ukraine as a potential source of damaging information about [Biden], nor did they describe Kyiv as complicit in an unsubstantiated 2016 election conspiracy theory \u2026 But their disparaging depictions of Ukraine reinforced Trump\u2019s perceptions of the country and fed a dysfunctional dynamic in which White House officials struggled to persuade Trump to support the fledgling government in Kyiv instead of exploiting it for political purposes \u2026\n\n\u201cThe role played by Putin and Orban, a hard-right leader who has often allied himself with the Kremlin\u2019s positions, was described in closed-door testimony last week by George Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state \u2026 Kent cited the influence of those leaders as a factor that helped sour Trump on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the months leading up to their July 25 phone call \u2026 The efforts to poison Trump\u2019s views toward Zelensky were anticipated by national security officials at the White House \u2026 But the voices of Putin and Orban took on added significance this year because of the departure or declining influence of those who had sought to blunt the influence of Putin and other authoritarian leaders over Trump. \u2026\n\n\u201cTrump spoke with Putin by phone and met with Orban at the White House in the weeks between Zelensky\u2019s April 21 election and his May 20 inauguration. Trump also spoke with Putin on June 28, during a global summit in Japan, and by phone on July 31, days after the call in which he solicited a \u2018favor\u2019 from Zelensky. \u2026 Trump turned to Putin for guidance on the new leader of Ukraine within days of Zelensky\u2019s election. In a May 3 call, Trump asked Putin about his impressions of Zelensky, according to a Western official familiar with the conversation. Putin said that he had not yet spoken with Zelensky but derided him as a comedian with ties to an oligarch despised by the Kremlin.\u201d\n\n-- Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is in Russia today to meet with Putin about Syria\u2019s future. \u201cErdogan\u2019s meeting with Putin, the Syrian government\u2019s most powerful supporter, was widely expected to center on the thorny aftermath of Turkey\u2019s military operation and the rapidly shifting Syrian map of control, as U.S. troops withdraw and competing factions rush to fill the void,\u201d Kareem Fahim and Sarah Dadouch report. \u201cPutin\u2019s role as Syria\u2019s central power broker was bolstered after the Trump administration announced it was withdrawing its remaining troops from the north.\u201d\n\n-- Programming note: Today\u2019s 202 comes to you from the great state of Texas. I\u2019m here to cheer on the Nationals against the Houston Astros in Games 1 and 2 of the World Series. I\u2019m on vacation for the rest of the week to focus on baseball, and then attend my college reunion, but the newsletter is in the able hands of my colleagues. I\u2019ll be back on Monday, when hopefully Washington has won the championship.\n\nWelcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning briefing for decision-makers.\n\nSign up to receive the newsletter.\n\nTHE LATEST ON IMPEACHMENT:\n\n-- Trump once again lashed out against the impeachment process during a raucous Cabinet meeting, calling on Republicans to \u201cget tougher.\u201d Toluse Olorunnipa and Robert Costa report: \u201cIn extemporaneous remarks that lasted more than an hour, Trump railed against what he called a \u2018phony investigation\u2019 of his dealings with Ukraine and blasted the \u2018phony emoluments clause\u2019 of the Constitution, which played a role in forcing him to scrap plans to host a global summit at his private golf club in Florida. ... Trump sought to defend himself from emoluments clause charges by making baseless accusations against his predecessors, accusing Obama and Washington of using their office to conduct private business deals.\u201d\n\n\"Behind the scenes, Trump\u2019s erratic and bombastic behavior is causing growing alarm among Republican lawmakers, donors and advisers who have called for a more disciplined impeachment response from the White House. \u2026 The president has told several friends in recent days that he believes Democrats are divided and somewhat scattered about how to proceed in their impeachment inquiry, according to people who have spoken with him. \u2026 Many Republicans, however, have told officials in the White House and allies in Trump\u2019s orbit that they cannot mount effective arguments in defense of the president. ...\n\n\u201cAs the White House has resisted calls to build a political operation to counter the Democrats on impeachment, some outside Trump allies, including former White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, have mulled starting their own initiatives to boost the president. Bannon \u2026 had talks over the weekend with associates about launching a podcast that he hopes would serve as an outside war room of sorts for the embattled president. ... Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski is one of the people Bannon has contacted in recent days about being a guest on the podcast. Both Lewandowski and former Trump deputy campaign manager David Bossie have long been discussed by Trump aides as possible hires for a White House defense effort \u2026 Regardless of outside efforts, the clamor for a more efficient and united impeachment front is expected to carry on this week, as some Trump loyalists float names for a new chief of staff and the president and top aides consider their next steps.\u201d\n\n-- Trump\u2019s Cabinet meetings have become about everything except the business of his Cabinet, writes Josh Dawsey: \u201cUnder Trump, Cabinet meetings have become less about the business of his Cabinet than an opportunity for the president to invite in the assembled press to boast of his own accomplishments, lash out at his critics and to hear the praise flow forth from advisers seated around a large oval table. The gatherings, with the press in attendance, often stretch for 60 to 90 minutes. \u2026 Much of the event seemed about self-validation as Trump\u2019s allies describe a presidency under siege \u2014 and a president frustrated with an onslaught of criticism. \u2018I\u2019m very good at real estate,\u2019 he said, without being asked about his real estate prowess. For several minutes, he used the White House setting to talk up his resort in Florida while defending himself against claims that he uses the presidency to help his properties. \u2026 Without prompting, he informed the government\u2019s top officers \u2014 and the assembled news media \u2014 about his prowess at filling arenas.\u201d\n\n-- The Post\u2019s Fact Checker went over some of the most misleading claims Trump made during the 71-minute riff.\n\n-- A Republican resolution to censure House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) for his handling of the impeachment inquiry was tabled on a party-line vote. Meanwhile, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) distributed a \u201cfact sheet\u201d outlining what her office called a gross abuse of presidential power. The document argues Trump was involved in a \u201cshakedown,\u201d \u201cpressure campaign\u201d and a \u201ccover up\u201d to get Ukraine to dig up dirt on his political adversaries. (John Wagner, Brittany Shammas and Michael Brice-Saddler)\n\n-- Prepare for another big day in the impeachment investigation: Bill Taylor, the top official at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, is scheduled to appear for a deposition on Capitol Hill. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper, who works on Ukraine, Russia and Eurasia, is expected to appear in a closed session on Wednesday.\n\n-- Even as the investigation moves swiftly, House Democrats have resigned themselves to the likelihood that impeachment proceedings will extend into the Christmas season, per the New York Times: \u201cThere are risks for Democrats in the longer timeline, which could make it more difficult for lawmakers in politically competitive districts, who fear a backlash from constituents if they appear to be preoccupied with targeting Mr. Trump instead of addressing major issues such as gun safety or health care. And Democrats are all too aware that Mr. Trump has succeeded in the past in steering the subject away from allegations of misconduct on his part, as he did with the [Russia investigation]. This time, Democratic leaders hope to deny him the opportunity.\u201d\n\n-- Some depositions have been rescheduled because of the funeral services for Elijah Cummings. Nearly half a dozen Democrats are considering bids to replace Cummings as the chairman of the House Oversight Committee. Karoun Demirjian and Mike DeBonis report: \u201cRep. Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.) is serving as acting chair of the committee, as its most senior Democratic member \u2026 She intends to seek the gavel on a permanent basis. \u2026 But other members of the panel say they believe they have a stronger case for becoming the face of Congress\u2019s top watchdog panel \u2026 Reps. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.) and Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) both plan to launch bids to succeed Cummings as Oversight chair. \u2026 Some members of the Congressional Black Caucus are laying the groundwork to support Rep. William Lacy Clay (D-Mo.), who is African American and the third-highest-ranking Democrat on the panel, should he elect to run for the chairmanship \u2026 Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), who is the second-highest-ranking Democrat on the panel and is also African American, said Monday that she was supporting Maloney due to her seniority. But, she added, \u2018if something happens to her, I\u2019m next, and I will sure try to get it.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- A new CNN poll shows that half of Americans believe Trump should be impeached and removed from office, the first time that support for impeachment and removal has significantly outpaced opposition in CNN\u2019s polling on the topic.\n\n-- Vacancies Act drama: The White House personnel director told Trump his two top picks for Department of Homeland Security secretary are ineligible for the job. From the Journal: \u201cSean Doocey, head of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, informed the president that neither Ken Cuccinelli nor Mark Morgan, who head two prominent immigration agencies at the Department of Homeland Security, were legally eligible to lead the agency on an acting basis. \u2026 The federal statute that governs vacancies states that acting officials in cabinet-level positions must either be next in line for a position or hold a Senate-confirmed post. Under a third option, the official being elevated must have served for at least 90 days in the past year under the previous secretary. During the meeting Friday, Mr. Doocey briefed Mr. Trump on an opinion from the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel that the past secretary was [Kirstjen] Nielsen, not [Kevin] McAleenan ... Under that interpretation, Messrs. Cuccinelli and Morgan wouldn\u2019t qualify, as they joined the agency after Ms. Nielsen departed.\u201d\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau kisses his wife, Sophie Gr\u00e9goire-Trudeau, at his victory party last night. (Valerie Blum/EPA-EFE/Rex)\n\nTHE NEW WORLD ORDER:\n\n-- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has survived scandal and missteps to win a plurality of seats in parliament in Canada\u2019s election. But he failed to retain his majority, leaving his government dependent on the support of smaller parties to advance his agenda. Amanda Coletta reports from Toronto: \u201cTrudeau\u2019s Liberal Party has won more seats than Andrew Scheer\u2019s Conservatives, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. and CTV News projected \u2026 but fell short of the 170 needed for a majority in the 338-seat House of Commons. \u2026 The election will create Canada\u2019s fourth minority government in 15 years, and delivers a setback for Trudeau, the 47-year-old Liberal leader who swept to power in 2015 with a stunning landslide victory.\n\n\u201cWithout a majority, Trudeau could try to pass bills on a case-by-case basis, negotiating for the support of one or more of the other parties. He could also establish a formal coalition, in which parties share cabinet seats, but such arrangements are rare in Canada. Both the third-place separatist Bloc Quebecois and the fourth-place New Democratic Party appeared to have enough seats to help the Liberals stay in power. The first test of a minority government is the Speech from the Throne, in which the leader puts forth his agenda, and it\u2019s put to a vote. If Trudeau loses, his government collapses. The governor general, who represents the queen of England in Canada, could then call on other parties to try to form a government to avoid another election.\u201d Trudeau is expected to remain prime minister.\n\n-- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave up his struggle to form a governing coalition after last month\u2019s dead-heat election, opening a possible path to power for his rival, former army chief of staff Benny Gantz. Steve Hendrix reports from Jerusalem: \u201cIsraeli President Reuven Rivlin immediately said he would give Gantz a chance to assemble a majority of lawmakers, making him the first person other than Netanyahu authorized to form a government in more than a decade. Gantz will have 28 days to do what Netanyahu could not: entice at least 61 members of the Israeli parliament, or Knesset, to support his bid. Gantz\u2019s success is far from certain. Israel\u2019s complex political system all but ensures that the final outcome is not likely to be clear for weeks and that a third election in less than a year may be required. \u2026\n\n\u201cThe parties emerged from the September elections with a nearly identical number of seats, and neither was close to a controlling majority. The prime minister released a video Monday announcing an end to his efforts, two days before the deadline and on his 70th birthday \u2026 Netanyahu warned in the video that Gantz could assume power with the support of Israeli Arab lawmakers, whose party emerged as the third-largest in the Knesset, and that those parliamentarians \u2018encourage terror and oppose Israel\u2019s existence.\u2019 In a brief statement, Gantz\u2019s party said, \u2018The time for spin is over, and it is now time for action.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Trump confirmed what we previewed in yesterday's edition: A limited number of U.S. troops will remain in Syria to man a garrison on the nation\u2019s southern border with Jordan and to \u201csecure the oil\u201d elsewhere in the country. Kareem Fahim, Karen DeYoung and Susannah George report: \u201c\u2018I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary, other than we secure the oil,\u2019 Trump said of the U.S. military presence. \u2026 A \u2018small number of troops\u2019 would also remain in southern Syria at the request of Israel and Jordan, he added \u2026 A U.S. official with knowledge of Syria operations said the proposal calls for 200 U.S. troops to remain in the oil-producing area, both to keep it out of the hands of the Islamic State and to prevent it from being claimed by the Syrian government, which is steadily recovering territory with backing from Russia and Iran. ... Videos that circulated online showed some residents in northern Syria heckling the soldiers and pelting the vehicles, most flying large American flags, with objects said to be rocks and rotten vegetables.\"\n\n-- Despite Trump promising to end the \u201cendless wars,\u201d there are now more U.S. troops in the Middle East than when he took office and he has kept tens of thousands of others stationed elsewhere. From the Times: \u201cTens of thousands of American troops remain deployed all over the world, some in war zones such as Somalia, Afghanistan, Iraq and \u2014 even still \u2014 Syria. And the United States maintains even more troops overseas in large legacy missions far from the wars following the Sept. 11 attacks, in such allied lands as Germany, South Korea and Japan. Although deployment numbers fluctuate daily, based on the needs of commanders, shifting missions and the military\u2019s ability to shift large numbers of personnel by transport planes and warships, a rough estimate is that 200,000 troops are deployed overseas today.\u201d\n\n-- The Pentagon is drawing up plans to leave Afghanistan in case Trump blindsides the military by ordering an abrupt withdrawal there. From NBC News: \u201cThe contingency planning is ongoing, the officials said, and includes the possibility that Trump orders all U.S. troops out of Afghanistan within weeks. Officials cautioned, however, that the planning is a precaution and there is currently no directive from the White House to pull U.S. troops out of Afghanistan. One of the officials called it \u2018prudent planning.\u2019 Another official described the president's current approach to Syria as \u2018a dress rehearsal\u2019 for what could happen in Afghanistan.\u201d\n\n-- England is considering prosecuting a pair of British ISIS fighters known as the Beatles who\u2019ve been linked to a cell suspected of involvement in the killing of American and British hostages in Syria. Ellen Nakashima and Souad Mekhennet report: \u201cThe Crown Prosecution Service, an independent public authority in England and Wales, has agreed to review its previous decision not to prosecute the men. The move came after the United States military took custody of the two British men, Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh, almost two weeks ago. \u2026 Kotey and Elsheikh were captured in early 2018. Earlier, British prosecutors had argued that they were prevented from extraditing the men because they were being detained by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, a nonstate entity, making their transfer difficult. The men, whose British citizenship was revoked over their alleged affiliation with ISIS, are believed to be part of the cell suspected of crimes, including the beheading of Americans James Foley, Steven Sotloff and Peter Kassig, as well as two British aid workers.\u201d\n\n-- Northern Ireland legalized abortion and same-sex marriage. Amanda Ferguson reports: \u201cNorthern Ireland\u2019s abortion laws had been some of the most restrictive in the world \u2014 the procedure was banned in almost all cases except when a woman\u2019s life was at risk. Women could be imprisoned not only for getting an abortion in the territory but for seeking one. Caregivers, too, could be criminally charged for giving advice on obtaining an abortion. \u2026 But beginning Tuesday, all prosecutions will be dropped, including a high-profile case against a mother who bought abortion pills for her then-15-year-old daughter.\"\n\n-- The warming climate is making baby sea turtles almost all girls, scientists warn. Danielle Paquette reports: \u201c\u2018Males here could vanish in two or three decades,\u2019 said Adolfo Marco, a Spanish researcher who camps every summer on Boa Vista, one of Cape Verde\u2019s 10 islands in the Atlantic. \u2018There will be no reproduction.\u2019 \u2026 Humans don\u2019t know why the environment shapes the gender of some lizards, crocodiles and various species of sea turtles. Even slight shifts in the land can warp their reproductive fate. Sea turtle eggs that incubate in sand below 81.86 degrees Fahrenheit produce males, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, while nests in the mid-80s create a gender mix. Anything higher than 87.8 degrees, though, is 100 percent girls.\u201d\n\n-- Cities around the world broke out in protests this weekend, from fires in the heart of Barcelona to tanks on the streets of Chile. Miriam Barger reports: \u201cOne overarching theme: Protesters say they are sick of the ruling elite. From Beirut to Santiago, demonstrators say political and economic institutions aren\u2019t working for the masses or representing their interests, as slogans convey. \u2026 Another key takeaway: Public dissatisfaction is spreading in ways politicians and pundits can\u2019t predict.\"\n\n-- International observers believe there are irregularities in the results that show Bolivian President Evo Morales avoiding a runoff. Accusations of election fraud have triggered mass street protests. From the Times: \u201cWith about 95 percent of the votes counted, election officials said Mr. Morales received 46.8 percent of the votes, while his closest rival, Carlos Mesa, won 36.7 percent. To avoid a runoff, the incumbent needed a 10-percentage-point advantage.\"\n\n-- Japan\u2019s new emperor, Naruhito, completed his formal enthronement. Naruhito proclaimed his rule before roughly 2,000 guests, including Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. (Japan Times)\n\n-- Never forget: Just over a year after the murder of Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi, Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin will attend an economic conference in Saudi Arabia next week. (HuffPost)\n\nKamala Harris speaks at a rally on Saturday at a high school in Aiken, S.C. (Michael Holahan/Augusta Chronicle/AP)\n\n2020 WATCH:\n\n-- Kamala Harris rose to Democratic stardom by weaving a narrative about fighting for consumers against big banks as California's attorney general. A new book challenges her storyline. Politico has a preview: Aaron Glantz's book, \u201cHomewreckers,\u201d argues that \u201cHarris not only allowed Steve Mnuchin\u2019s OneWest bank to get away with foreclosing on tens of thousands of state homeowners, but then tried to bury the evidence. \u2026 [The book] posits that a group of Wall Street moguls including Trump Cabinet appointees Mnuchin and Wilbur Ross, as well as White House insiders like Steve Schwarzman and Tom Barrack, took advantage of \u2018a rigged system\u2019 to transfer billions of dollars from individual homeowners into their own pockets during the Great Recession. \u2026 \u2018All of these officials screwed up and dropped the ball \u2014 and hid it. The time period when all this homewrecking occurred was during the Obama presidency, and when AG\u2019s like Kamala Harris were on the job,\u2019 he said. \u2018It happened on her watch. And she\u2019s never been really forced to tell the other story -- and wrestle with the truth of what happened.\u2019\u201d Harris\u2019s campaign responded forcefully to the charges by highlighting Harris's work pioneering the Homeowner\u2019s Bill of Rights and her introduction of a bill that would empower state AGs to issue subpoenas to federal banks.\n\n-- Democrats are wondering if there is anybody else who could join the race. From Jonathan Martin in the New York Times: \u201cWhen a half-dozen Democratic donors gathered at the Whitby Hotel in Manhattan last week, the dinner began with a discussion of which presidential candidates the contributors liked. But as conversations among influential Democrats often go these days, the meeting quickly evolved into a discussion of who was not in the race \u2014 but could be lured in.\u201d Here are some of the \u201cwhite knights\u201d that some Democratic leaders would like to see enter the contest at the last minute:\n\nHillary Clinton and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who have \u201cboth told people privately in recent weeks that if they thought they could win, they would consider entering the primary \u2014 but that they were skeptical there would be an opening.\u201d\n\nFormer Secretary of State John Kerry, who associates say has wondered whether he should\u2019ve run and has found Biden\u2019s missteps \u201chard to watch.\u201d But he still thinks the former vice president is the best nominee.\n\nFormer attorney general Eric Holder, who is reportedly considering a last-minute entry but has conceded it may be too late.\n\nOhio Sen. Sherrod Brown, who said \u201cthe pressure on him to reconsider from labor leaders, Democratic officials and donors has \u2018become more frequent.\u2019\u201d\n\nFormer Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, who said \u201cit\u2019s nice to be rumored about\u201d before refusing to rule out a last-minute entry.\n\n-- Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) called for billions of new dollars to overhaul public schools from pre-K through 12th grade. She wants America\u2019s wealthiest to pay for it. Valerie Strauss reports: \u201cHer plan also would eliminate use of test scores for high-stakes decisions and end federal funding for new charter schools \u2026 Warren, who has touted dozens of plans for the country, said she would pay for her education vision with a proposed \u2018wealth tax\u2026. Some economists and other Democratic candidates have said the tax would not raise as much as Warren said it would and could not pay for everything she plans.\"\n\n-- Entrepreneur Andrew Yang said he won\u2019t join a minor party or run as an independent if he\u2019s not the Democratic nominee. Amy B Wang reports: \u201c\u2018I would never do anything that would increase the chance of Donald Trump becoming president [again],\u2019 Yang said at a Washington Post Live event. \u2018The goal is to beat that man, get him out of the Oval Office.\u2019 \u2026 Yang lightly criticized a wealth tax \u2014 such as the one fellow candidates [Berrnie Sanders] and [Warren] have made pillars of their campaigns \u2014 saying it had already been tried in other countries, only to be repealed because implementation problems meant it didn\u2019t generate as much revenue as expected. \u2018I am not conceptually against a wealth tax,\u2019 Yang said. ... 'I would not rule it out, but it\u2019s not, to me, the first and best choice.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Bernie Sanders defended Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) against claims she is a \u201cRussian asset,\u201d calling the suggestion \u201coutrageous.\u201d From CNN: \u201c\u2018Tulsi Gabbard has put her life on the line to defend this country,\u2019 the Vermont independent tweeted. \u2018People can disagree on issues, but it is outrageous for anyone to suggest that Tulsi is a foreign asset.\u2019 Sanders does not name Hillary Clinton in the tweet, but his comments appear to be aimed at the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee \u2026 Clinton's team on Monday declined to comment to CNN about Sanders' tweet. \u2026 Clinton's team, after receiving bipartisan criticism, said the former secretary of state was saying that Republicans and [Trump] were grooming the congresswoman.\u201d\n\n-- Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) is getting a lot of mileage out of her performance in the last debate. From the Times: \u201cRiding a post-debate wave of attention, Ms. Klobuchar blitzed New Hampshire and Iowa last week, attracting new supporters and donors in those two states with early nominating contests. After months stuck in the polling doldrums, Ms. Klobuchar is getting a second look. But she faces several challenges, among them that she is arguing how to win general election swing states but has yet to show how she would win the nomination first.\"\n\n-- Former Housing and Urban Development secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro threatened to drop out of the presidential race if he doesn\u2019t raise $800,000 by the end of October. From the Texas Tribune: \u201cWhile the last fundraising quarter was Castro's best yet \u2014 he raised $3.5 million \u2014 he continued to spend heavily, pushing his cash-on-hand total down to just $672,000, dangerously low for a White House bid. While Castro's campaign says he has the 165,000 donors needed for the November debate, he has not made any headway on the additional polling requirement: 3% in any four surveys or 5% in two polls in the early voting states. The other Texan in the race, Beto O'Rourke, is in a similar position, with just one qualifying poll. While he has not issued any threats to leave the contest, his campaign announced earlier this month that it needed to raise $2 million in six weeks to fund critical efforts to advertise and organize.\u201d\n\n-- Data shows that the most loyal Trump allies are Republicans who watch Fox News, writes Philip Bump: \u201cNearly half of respondents in PRRI\u2019s annual American Values Survey say that they disapprove of Trump and that nothing he could do would change their minds. By contrast, only about a quarter of respondents say the opposite: They\u2019ll stick with Trump no matter what. \u2026 No part of that group is more loyal than those Republicans who watch Fox News Channel. \u2026 Only about 3 in 10 Republicans whose primary news source is something other than Fox were as solid in their support of Trump. Even Republicans without a college degree, a bastion of Trump\u2019s support in 2016, and white evangelical Protestants were less likely to say that they expected to stick with Trump no matter what.\u201d\n\n-- Trump is going all-in on a trio of Southern governor\u2019s races in November. Politico\u2019s Alex Isenstadt reports: \u201cTrump is expected to barnstorm Kentucky, Mississippi, and Louisiana over the next few weeks \u2026 And Vice President Mike Pence is planning a bus tour through eastern Kentucky. Behind the scenes, Trump has been quizzing aides and allies on the three contests and been in touch with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) about [Matt] Bevin\u2019s reelection fight. He also speaks regularly with Bevin \u2026 The White House has calculated that Trump is likely to take the brunt of the blame for a loss whether he campaigns or not. So he\u2019s decided to jump in head-first so he can take credit if Republicans win.\u201d\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\n\nTrump tweeted this morning that he\u2019s the victim of what he called a \u201clynching\u201d:\n\nThis is the first time Trump has used the word \u201clynching\u201d as president, on Twitter or out loud. pic.twitter.com/540h8Cdtgo \u2014 Daniel Dale (@ddale8) October 22, 2019\n\nThe chair of the Congressional Black Caucus responded:\n\nYou are comparing a constitutional process to the PREVALENT and SYSTEMATIC brutal torture of people in THIS COUNTRY that looked like me? https://t.co/3v4oMuPC6C \u2014 Congressmember Bass (@RepKarenBass) October 22, 2019\n\nSo did other African American lawmakers:\n\nIf the President wishes to learn about actual lynching, I would encourage him to read, support, & pass my bill, the Emmett Till Antilynching Act, which makes lynching a federal hate crime.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately for him, there are no anti-impeachment sections. https://t.co/onWlWpifX6 \u2014 Bobby L.

I\u2019m so f------ glad we got Osuna!\u201d He was referencing embattled closer Roberto Osuna, who has been accused of assaulting the mother of his child:\n\nRidiculous. Lost for words. Women in baseball clubhouses have such a high tolerance for borderline intolerable things. The idea that anyone would make this up...\n\n\n\nAlso, we define \u201ca difficult time\u201d differently.

He hadn\u2019t been, you know, beaten up by a spouse. https://t.co/hb0oO7RnZG \u2014 Chelsea Janes (@chelsea_janes) October 22, 2019\n\nFrom the Sports Illustrated story: The Astros \"traded for [Osuna], and in terms of traditional organizational capital, the price was low: the Astros gave up their own struggling closer and two middling pitching prospects for him. But the price was low for a reason: Many teams didn\u2019t want to deal with the public backlash for acquiring Osuna. The Astros decided it was worth it. Since he got to Houston, Osuna has a 2.46 ERA and 50 saves. The Astros may win another World Series. But that doesn\u2019t mean they get to decide when the backlash ends. ... And that\u2019s the irony of that interaction with Taubman. None of those women were talking to him. They weren\u2019t even talking about Osuna. Taubman brought him up.\"\n\nA Houston Chronicle reporter at the scene said the Sports Illustrated writer's report is correct, and he expressed regret for not speaking out about the incident earlier:\n\nThe Astros called this @stephapstein report misleading. It is not. I was there. Saw it.
