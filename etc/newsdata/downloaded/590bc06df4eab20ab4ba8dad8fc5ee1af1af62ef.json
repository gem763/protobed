What hasn\u2019t a Kihnu woman done? They kept a running list of all of the necessary jobs they remember Kihnu women doing in the absence of men, from fixing tractor engines to performing church services when the Russian Orthodox priest wasn\u2019t available. So far, there has been only one job no one can claim.\n\n\u201cDigging a grave,\u201d Maie Aav, the museum director, said, \u201cbut even that is questionable.\u201d Like the elders, Aav, who is in her mid-40s, was also wearing a traditional skirt (called a kort), but hers had a slight colour variation to represent her younger age.\n\nVisitors to this peaceful isle in the Baltic Sea are struck by its windswept beaches surrounding pristine forests and the occasional brightly coloured farmhouse. At nearly 7 square miles, Kihnu is the seventh largest of Estonia\u2019s more than 2,000 islands.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

In contrast, Kihnu stands out precisely because of its inhabitants. The island is known for its abundance of women.\n\nMen began to fade from everyday life on Kihnu in the 19th century, thanks to their jobs at sea. Fishing and hunting seals took them away from home for months at a time. In response, Kihnu women stepped in and ran the island. Otherwise traditional female roles expanded to include anything their society needed to thrive and function. Eventually, this became ingrained in Kihnu heritage, as Unesco noted when it inscribed aspects of the culture on its Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2008.\n\nBut tiny, traditional Kihnu has a growing modern problem. The population is shrinking as islanders move away because of a lack of jobs.\n\nOn top of that, changes in the fishing industry are bringing a new stress: the men are coming home for longer periods of time. Some have even stayed.\n\n\u201cWe will have to commercialise eventually, but the question is which way is best for us,\u201d said Mare Matas, president of the Kihnu Cultural Space Foundation, which is dedicated to promoting and protecting the islanders\u2019 history and traditions through events, festivals and educational initiatives.\n\nLike many Kihnu women, Matas is a multitasking dynamo who is fiercely passionate about preserving her heritage. In addition to managing several homestays on the island (including one at her own home), she is also the current lighthouse keeper and an island tour guide.\n\nHer yellow house near the coast was a flurry of activity on the March afternoon I arrived by ferry from Munalaid Port, a harbour outside of Parnu, Estonia\u2019s fourth-largest city that\u2019s roughly 27 miles away. Her oldest daughter, Liis, then 18, was home from the mainland, where she lives during the week while she attends high school in Parnu. (There is no high school on Kihnu.) Anni, 12, and Maria, 9, were rushing to get ready for the school talent show that evening. (Her son Martin, 21, attends college in Tallinn, Estonia\u2019s capital, about 110 miles away.) Like their mother, they all have flaxen blonde hair and piercing cornflower blue eyes.\n\nAt first glance, the petite 43-year-old mother of four would fit in anywhere with her sleek, chin-length bob, trendy black glasses and delicate gold hoop earrings. However, her closet is full of an everyday uniform of sorts: hand-woven skirts and custom paisley aprons.\n\nAn apron worn over a Kihnu skirt signifies a married woman. Matas\u2019 husband, a fisherman, was away at sea.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 10 best European destinations 2019 Show all 10 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

During my visit, I encountered only two: a visiting documentary filmmaker and a builder fixing a house.\n\nKihnu society functions as a large, tight-knit family \u2014 and with that comes all of the typical big family behaviour. At the school talent show, knowing looks volleyed from blonde head to blonde head as the women scooted their chairs closer to friends to gossip in low voices or exchange pleasantries in louder ones. A toddler roamed around the schoolhouse gym freely, picked up and cuddled by unrelated women.\n\nThere is a clear hierarchy in Kihnu: children, community and, lastly, men.\n\n\u201cWe have totally different mentalities than people on the mainland. Kihnu women always want to do what is best for the family, especially the children,\u201d Aav told me during a visit to the Kihnu Museum, which displays the history and culture of the island and its important artifacts.\n\nThe island is not for everyone \u2014 nor do the women want everyone to visit. Kihnu women are known for their candour, and the island is not for the easily offended.\n\n\u201cMass tourism is not good for Kihnu,\u201d Aav said. \u201cWe want cultural tourism; people who are really interested in our culture, our lifestyle, how we are living. If they\u2019re interested, they\u2019re welcome, but they must accept it.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Kihnu\u2019s charm is that it is in no way set up for mass tourism. A large tree branch propped against a house\u2019s front door means nobody\u2019s home. The only street signs are for the island\u2019s four villages: Lemsi, Linakula, Rootsikula and Saare.\n\nThere are no lines on the road \u2014 and very few paved roads to paint a line on. There are no chains and no commercialisation. There is no ATM, no restaurant open year-round, and the first police station is currently under construction. Here, visitors are guests, not tourists. I stayed in Matas\u2019 homestead property and was quickly incorporated into her daily life, including meals, chores and island events.\n\n\u201cHow do you welcome in the modern world, but keep this ancient culture alive? They\u2019re in this limbo state of trying to find the balance,\u201d Silvia Soide, a folk dance teacher and photographer, said. Soide moved from Vancouver, British Columbia, to Kihnu in December 2008 in honour of her Estonian grandmother who fled the island during World War II.\n\n\u201cThe older generation wants to keep the traditions and culture alive, so they\u2019re teaching what they were taught. It should stay alive; it\u2019s a beautiful culture, but I know that younger people feel frustrated. They\u2019re welcoming in the outside world because it offers them a way of survival. It\u2019s a really great opportunity for Kihnu women to earn money during the tourism season,\u201d said Soide, imagining jobs such as cooking, innkeeping, sales and waitressing.\n\nKihnu can feel much larger than its four-mile length and two-mile width, as I found out on a walk to the rocky coast and back one morning. The only signs of life I encountered were a hound dog, fast asleep on a sun-warmed road, and a curious seal bobbing in the waves off the jagged coast. I turned off the beach down one of the many unmarked sandy roads that cut through the towering forests. Behind me, waves from the Gulf of Riga crashed against rocks. An occasional tree branch creaked or snapped in the wind. The forest grew wild, allowed to do what nature intended it to.\n\nI thought of the way Soide described the island. \u201cEverybody from Kihnu really loves Kihnu. It grows roots around your feet.\u201d The forest had a fairy-tale quality that made this seem plausible.\n\nMuch like Estonians at large, Kihnu\u2019s residents have all been through significant changes in their lifetimes \u2014 often political (including Soviet and German occupation) and often out of their control. When asked about the island\u2019s biggest changes, the answers vary wildly.\n\n\u201cTrousers,\u201d said the shy Roosie Karjam, 83, sitting in the museum\u2019s community room, after much thought and cajoling. Karjam, Kihnu\u2019s most famous weaver and a beloved elder, nodded her kerchiefed head firmly, her fingers twisting and untwisting as if weaving air. \u201cWomen never used to wear trousers.\u201d\n\nThat afternoon, armed with gifts of apples and schnapps, Matas and I went to visit 91-year-old Virve Koster at her log cabin in the woods. When asked what has changed during her lifetime, she laughed. \u201cOh, everything,\u201d she declared. Better known as \u201cKihnu Virve,\u201d she had reinvented herself in her Seventies, going on to become one of Estonia\u2019s top-selling female folk singers.\n\nAs a woman on Kihnu, there is a strong sense that everything is possible. If something needs to be done, a woman on Kihnu has done it, and another woman will probably do it again soon.\n\nThe conversation inevitably turned to the uniqueness of the island. While sitting across from Koster, Matas pondered the concept of feminism, often met with bewilderment here. The reasoning: Of course, women are capable. Of course, women are competent. But no, men and women aren\u2019t equal \u2014 women have proven they can do everything men can, but men can\u2019t do everything women can.\n\n\u201cPeople think we are making some statement with the women being in charge, but that\u2019s our culture,\u201d she reasoned. \u201cIt works. We can\u2019t imagine it any other way.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "In the Kihnu Museum on a tiny Estonian island, the elders, dressed in matching striped skirts, pondered a favourite question over coffee.
