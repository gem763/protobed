The actress and singer said that she was at the surgery to 'correct her asymmetrical lips' when the doctor opened an unmarked packet of the filler substance\n\nValentina, pictured, after she was provided the first aid. She said that she was hit in the face over and over by the surgeon with her own phone\n\nShe suffered from a broken nose, a head injury and concussion. According to the doctor, she had complained about another linked clinic's work\n\nThe extraordinary fracas in the surgical room came to light with the patient\u2019s video in which she alleged: 'I'm in the clinic now.\n\n'I got beaten up by a doctor for videotaping (the woman doctor) punching me.\n\n'She started hitting me in the face and head with my phone.'\n\nDr Sokolan did not initially comment on the incident but then accused the patient of behaving 'boorishly', swearing at her, then jumping on her.\n\nThe medic then said she reversed an earlier decision to do free corrective treatment for the patient after Sidorova was unhappy with the work of another linked clinic, she said.\n\nDr Olesya Sokolan (pictured left and right), 34, said that it was Sidorova who attacked her. She said the woman acted 'boorishly' and swore and jumped on her\n\nCosmetic surgeon, Dr Sokolan (pictured), 34, graduated in 2009 from highly respected First Moscow State Medical University, the oldest in Russia\n\nShe accused Sidorova of using 'obscene words..and provoking me' using her camera, and 'rushing' at her which caused her to fall causing concussion and an abdominal injury when she was in the early stages of pregnancy.\n\nSidorova, who had gone to Dr Sokolan, 34, to 'correct' her 'asymmetrical lips', gave a different account.\n\nThe patient alleged the doctor was using an unbranded substance to inject into her.\n\n'I asked why there was no official box and brand identification marks,' she said.\n\n'To which she replied: \u2018Either you trust the doctor or not.\u2019\n\n'I replied that I was seeing her for the first time and I would like to be convinced of the originality and quality of the drug, since I care about my health.\n\n'To which I heard the rude words: \u2018Get up and get out of here.\u2019\n\nSidorova said she started video recording the argument on her smartphone .\n\nThe doctor 'suddenly pulled the phone out of my hands' and then used it to strike her, she alleged.\n\nPictured: The entrance to the beauty parlour in Moscow. Sokolan said that she then ran and hid in a utility room. When she came to get her phone back, she said the staff said she belonged in a mental unit\n\n'The doctor hit me with strong and sharp blows to my head and face, nose, eye, and forehead.\n\n'I started to feel dizzy.\n\n'Sokolan tried to smash the phone against the floor.\n\n'Then the administrators ran in.\n\n'One held me, and the second tried to pull off the doctor, but she kept beating me on the back of the head.'\n\nSokolan then ran to hide in a utility room, and when Valentina went to reclaim her phone, she claimed the doctor tried to wedge her arms in the door.\n\nAs other patients looked on, members of staff claimed - wrongly - that she was 'a crazy one from a mental clinic' urging them to ignore her.\n\nShe persuaded a patient to call her husband who then phoned the police, she said.\n\nValentina\u2019s mother Yana Sidorova vowed to get justice. 'All those involved, the beautician, the administrators, and all the staff, will be punished'\n\nShe filed a complaint to police and was admitted to Moscow\u2019s Botkin Hospital where she was diagnosed with a a nose fracture, head injury and concussion.\n\nDr Sokolan graduated in 2009 from highly respected First Moscow State Medical University, the oldest in Russia.\n\nValentina\u2019s mother Yana Sidorova vowed to get justice.\n\n'All those involved, the beautician, the administrators, and all the staff, will be punished'.\n\nA friend of the singer actress Anna Nazarova told Peopletalk magazine that Valentia was 'terrified'.\n\n'I cannot conceive how this could happen,' she said.\n\n'Valentina has concussion, a head injury and a broken nose.\n\n'She is still in hospital.'\n\nShe demanded that the plastic surgery clinic is held responsible.\n\nPolice are reported to be investigating the dispute.", "description": "A Russian singer and actress is being treated for a head injury, broken nose and concussion - after claiming she was 'attacked' during treatment on her lips by a female cosmetic surgeon.", "authors": ["Will Stewart For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/16/20186484-0-image-a-53_1572017122019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
