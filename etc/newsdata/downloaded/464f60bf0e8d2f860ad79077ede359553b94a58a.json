'We do have it in the gift shop, spa and front desk,' a receptionist told DailyMail.com, speaking from a high-end mid-mountain resort located about 8,400 feet above sea level.\n\nIt also has a Jack Nicklaus-designed golf course \u2013 an obvious perk for President Trump during the June 2020 summit.\n\nAt the Montage resort in Deer Valley \u2013 another location state development officials identified as suitable for an event like the G7 \u2013 small Oxygen canisters go for $12. It is for sale at the spa, which also offers altitude tea for anyone who gets a 'bit dizzy,' according to a concierge.\n\nFormer Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah told DailyMail.com Deer Valley is well situated to host the event, which instead will be taking place in June 2020 at the president's golf course in Miami.\n\n'We hosted the Olympics so I'm sure we can host the G7,' Chaffetz said.\n\nActing White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney mentioned states that got passed over \u2013 Utah, Colorado, North Carolina, Michigan, Tennessee, Hawaii, and California\n\nThe Montage resort has oxygen canisters on hand for guests who may suffer from altitude sickness\n\nThe Stein Eriksin lodge boasts 'the finest amenities, and secluded alpine charm' \u2013 plus oxygen for sale in the spa\n\nBREATH OF FRESH AIR: The resorts are located at about 8,400 feet\n\nUtah is home to Sen. Mitt Romney, who blasted Trump's call to the president of Ukraine\n\nIT'S A GAS: The White House has twice raised the issue of altitude for why another site was not selected\n\n'It's world class,' said Lee Lonsberry, press secretary to Republican Utah Rep. Rob Bishop.\n\nIn August, Salt Lake City became the first city outside New York to host the UN's civil society conference. Eight thousand people registered for the event, held in the city's Salt Palace.\n\n'There are plenty of hotel rooms in Utah,' said Pete Codella, an officials with the Utah governor's Office of Economic Development. 'We had not heard about Utah locations being considered for the G7. Of course, Utah is happy to host anyone interested in meeting or visiting our great state,' he said.\n\nThe White House raised security, airport access, parking, and available rooms as factors in the decision made by a team \u2013 which got a direct recommendation from President Trump that his private club be considered.\n\nSean Stinson of Visit Salt Lake noted that Bill and Hillary Clinton visited Utah to ski in Deer Valley while Clinton was president, and President Bush also visited.\n\nAnother notable resident, Republican Sen. Mitt Romney, who delivered a blistering floor speech against the president's Syria policy and called the president's call to Ukraine 'deeply troubling,' bought a huge home in the Deer Valley resort area after his 2012 election loss.\n\nAlthough the resorts are as much as a mile high, 'I've never heard of altitude sickness being much of a thing in the Park City area and I lived there,' he said. 'If it's the group I'm thinking of, I don't know how fit they all are,' Stinson observed.\n\nGrisham noted that an interagency team scouted locations for taxpayers before the final selection was made.\n\n'We had members of our military office, Secret Service, advance teams. We had several people, the State Department, go out to ten different states and look at 12 different sites. All of them came back and made the recommendations to the president that Doral is the perfect place to hold such a summit.\n\nMulvaney told reporters Thursday the president's club was 'far and away \u2013 the best physical facility for this meeting' and won praise from the scouting group.\n\n'There's separate buildings with their own rooms, separate and apart from each building, so that one country can have a building, another country can have another, you folks could have your building for the press. And obviously, the common areas are going to be perfect for our needs down there,' he said.\n\nMulvaney also brought up the oxygen issue.\n\n'I mean, there was one place -- I won't say where it was -- where we actually had to figure out if we were going to have to have oxygen tanks for the participants because of the altitude. So, yeah, there's just -- there's limitations in other places,' Mulvaney said.\n\nBut asked by DailyMail.com if the White House would reveal a paper trail of how it decided to select Doral, Mulvaney said: 'If you want to see how we did this, the answer is no.'\n\nRomney also brushed off howls by outside government watchdog groups. 'There's no issue here on him profiting from this in any way, shape or form,' Mulvaney said of the president, saying Trump would not take make any money over the event.\n\nFormer director of the Office of Government Ethics Walter Shaub tweeted Friday: 'Trump is not be subject to the conflict of interest statute but, as the owner of the Trump Organization, he is subject to the Procurement Integrity Act. We need to know what information he obtained while he was participating in the selection of Doral for the G7.'\n\nAnother finalist that lost out was in Hawaii. Mulvaney said other losers were located in California, Colorado, Michigan, North Carolina, and Tennessee.", "description": "Two sites in Utah were rejected in favor of the President's Mar-a-Lago club, with the White House saying one could have made visiting guests 'sick' due to its high altitude.", "authors": ["Geoff Earle", "Deputy U.S. Political Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/21/19902056-0-image-a-20_1571430547249.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
