I only became aware of this because of an article by transgender activist and writer Katelyn Burns at Vox. (I know\u2026 I know\u2026 It\u2019s Vox. But bear with me here.) She starts out talking about the case of funeral director Aimee Stephens, who we\u2019ve discussed here on several occasions involving the lawsuit against Stephens\u2019 employer. (Side note: as a reminder, I\u2019m using the incorrect female pronoun for Burns because she\u2019s gone through \u201ctransition\u201d surgery. It\u2019s the same policy that I apply to others such as Chelsea Manning and anyone else who demonstrates the sheer bloodymindedness to have their private bits lopped off.)\n\nWhat Burns is writing about is \u201cthe rise of the TERFs.\u201d This was yet another term I was unfamiliar with until now, and it stands for \u201ctrans-exclusionary radical feminists.\u201d It has to do with feminist groups who reject the notion of men \u201cidentifying\u201d as women being actual women. This has the rest of the community up in arms, apparently. Here\u2019s a brief snippet of who she\u2019s talking about here.\n\nIn their amicus brief to the Supreme Court, the Women\u2019s Liberation Front, or WoLF, writes, \u201cSimply, Aimee Stephens is a man. He wanted to wear a skirt while at work, and his \u2018gender identity\u2019 argument is an ideology that dictates that people who wear skirts must be women, precisely the type of sex stereotyping forbidden by Price Waterhouse.\u201d Groups like WoLF are commonly referred to as \u201ctrans-exclusionary radical feminists,\u201d or TERFs. They alternate among several theories that all claim that trans women are really men, who are the ultimate oppressors of women. Most of their ideas \u2014 like that trans women are a threat to cisgender women\u2019s safety \u2014 are based on cherry-picked cases of horrific behavior by a small number of trans people. Above all else, their ideology doesn\u2019t allow for trans people to have self-definition or any autonomy over their gender expression.\n\nWow. Covering this subject has been really educational in ways I never anticipated. Yet another thing I\u2019d never heard of was the Women\u2019s Liberation Front or WoLF. It turns out that Burns isn\u2019t ginning up some sort of insult to WoLF by calling them \u201cradical feminists.\u201d If you go to WoLF\u2019s home page, the first line you see below the banner literally reads, \u201cWe are a radical feminist organization.\u201d\n\nWhat I\u2019m immediately finding fascinating about WoLF and related groups is the seeming dichotomy in their positions. On the one hand, their entire raison d\u2019etre is clearly to \u201ccrush the patriarchy\u201d (the word patriarchy is littered across their website like empty Cheetos bags on the floor of a fat dude\u2019s apartment) and to save women from the caustic effects of toxic masculinity. But at the same time, they are sticking to basic scientific truths about the two genders of human beings and how they operate, refusing to offer the male-to-female transgender individuals a spot in the clubhouse.\n\nThis is very different from the cases we\u2019ve seen of female athletes speaking out against such individuals when they barge into and dominate girls\u2019 and women\u2019s sports. Of course, they get roasted by the same groups, but they handle it very differently. In the cases where prominent female athletes have spoken up and suggested that women\u2019s sports should be reserved for actual women, they always couch their objections carefully in LGBT code. Their statements invariably begin with something along the lines of, \u201cOf course we\u2019re not saying that these women can\u2019t identify and live as they choose, but...\u201d\n\nNot that it does them any good, of course. You\u2019ll recall that Martina Navratilova was pilloried mercilessly for expressing an opinion like this, as was British Olympic swimmer Sharron Davies. (Outsports magazine literally compared Navratilova to Joseph Goebbels.) Davies recounted how she\u2019d spoken to many female athletes who felt the same way but were afraid to say so in public because they dreaded the transgender mafia descending on them like locusts.\n\nStill, this story remains one more data point to keep in mind as the ongoing transgender social justice wars continue. And now you\u2019ve got a nifty new acronym to keep in your back pocket.
