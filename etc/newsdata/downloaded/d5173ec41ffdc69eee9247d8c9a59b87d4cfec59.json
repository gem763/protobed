Tim Ryan drops out of presidential race", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan traveled to Kentucky to call on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to bring House-backed gun regulation bills to the U.S. Senate floor for a vote. AP\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Rep. Tim Ryan, who focused his presidential campaign on trying to win over working class voters who voted for President Donald Trump in 2016, has ended his bid for the White House.\n\nHe made his announcement in a video posted to his Twitter account Thursday.\n\n\"After seven long months of hard work, I'll be returning home to my family and friends and community in Ohio to run for re-election for my congressional seat,\" he said in the video.\n\nRyan, 46, has served as the U.S. Representative for Ohio\u2019s 13th Congressional District since 2003.\n\nIn April, Ryan announced his bid for the presidency during an appearance on ABC\u2019s \"The View,\" where he spoke about manufacturing plant closures across Ohio, insisting that the federal government needed to intervene.\n\n\"How do we come together, the best of government, the best of the workforce, the best of the free enterprise system and dominate the electric vehicle market so we're creating jobs?\" Ryan prompted during his campaign announcement.\n\nMore: Who is still running for president in 2020? An interactive guide\n\nI\u2019m announcing today that I am withdrawing from the Presidential campaign.\n\n\n\nI got into this race in April to really give voice to the forgotten people of our country. I look forward to continuing that fight.\n\n\n\nThank you, to everyone who supported this campaign. pic.twitter.com/BT4z3fQ205 \u2014 Tim Ryan (@TimRyan) October 24, 2019\n\nLike other moderate candidates in the field, Ryan often framed his electability as tied to an ability to win over blue collar voters.\n\n\u201cI am a progressive who knows how to talk to working class people, Ryan said on \"The View.\" \u201cI know how to get elected in working class districts because at the end of the day, the progressive agenda is what is best for working families.\u201d\n\nBut Ryan never managed to get more than 1% support in a national poll since entering the race, according to a list compiled by FiveThirtyEight that dates back to November. He failed to reach even that modest mark among Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic in a Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday.\n\nHe staked his platform on replenishing the store of industrial jobs lost in the last two decades, alluding to white, working class voters he sought to reclaim from Trump, in a CNN op-ed.\n\n\"In 2012, President Barack Obama won my home county by 23 points,\" he wrote. \"Just four years later, Trump won... they believed he could make things better. But I've been watching those same voters slip away from Trump. From farmers to factory workers, they are onto his scheme.\"\n\nThe list: Who is running for president in 2020? An interactive guide\n\nCLOSE The 2020 election is nearing and with that, comes the caucuses and primary elections. But what\u2019s the difference? Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nRyan's focus on courting industrial, heartland voters often alienated him from the progressive politics that characterized a number of his fellow candidates.\n\nDuring the first Democratic debate, for instance, Ryan said that Democrats wouldn't be able to confront problems such as climate change until they won the confidence of the whole country, rather than just coastal voters.\n\n\u201cWe have a perception problem with the Democratic Party,\" he said. \"We are not connecting to the working-class people in the very states I represent, in Ohio, in the industrial Midwest. We\u2019ve lost all connection.\"\n\nPrior to his presidential bid, Ryan was perhaps best known for challenging House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for her leadership position in 2017, when she served as House minority leader.\n\n\u201cAs I saw the blue firewall collapse, I was like: I need to step up,\u201d he told The Washington Post at the time, referring to Trump's fresh Oval Office victory. \u201cI need to be a bigger voice in the party.\u201d\n\nRyan ultimately lost, but won one-third of the caucus\u2019 support. He helped lead the charge to oust Pelosi again following the 2018 midterm elections, which also failed.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/10/24/election-2020-tim-ryan-drops-out-of-presidential-race/2011788001/", "description": "In April, Ryan\u00a0announced his bid for the presidency during an appearance on ABC\u2019s The View, where he spoke about manufacturing plant closures in Ohio.", "authors": ["Jason Lalljee", "Published P.M.
