Last night, she said there was 'no limit' to the party's ambitions.\n\nThe Lib Dems' official election policy is to stop Brexit by revoking Article 50 if they win. Otherwise, they will continue the campaign for a second referendum.\n\nPlease do not stand in our seats Tory MPs urge Farage Tory MPs have begged the Brexit Party to stand aside in their seats amid fears it could split the vote, the party's chairman has claimed. Richard Tice said he had received 'numerous' pleas from Tory MPs. One texted him to warn that their seat could fall to the Remain-supporting Liberal Democrats in the election. They said that they were a Brexiteer and therefore should be spared, Mr Tice said. The Brexit Party is understood to have vetted 600 candidates and will field them in most seats across the country \u2013 except Northern Ireland. However, there have been calls from some Brexiteers for an informal electoral 'pact' between Nigel Farage's party and the Tories. Downing Street has so far rejected the idea. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme yesterday, Mr Tice urged the Government to form an alliance with his party as soon as a General Election is called. He predicted that a 'Leave alliance' between Mr Farage and Boris Johnson would deliver a 'thumping election victory'. The MEP said: 'We have made a generous offer to the PM, that if you stand for a clean-break Brexit, we will stand down and not fight with your candidates.' However, he was reluctant to say whether Mr Farage's party would stand candidates if Mr Johnson campaigned during the election on the basis of his Brexit deal. He said: 'We will not negotiate live on air. We will negotiate with the Conservatives.' And although Mr Farage is ardently opposed to the Prime Minister's agreement with the EU, the party leader has also hinted that candidates might not stand in every seat in the next election. Asked if the party would place candidates in every constituency if Mr Johnson asks voters to back his new deal, Mr Farage said: 'We will discuss that over the next couple of days.'\n\nThe party is already polling well in Golders Green in north London, where Luciana Berger is standing, and hopes to pick up Richmond in south-west London and the Cities of London and Westminster which Chuka Umunna hopes to win.\n\nThey are also confident of taking seats in Oxfordshire and several in Scotland. The party is confident of winning at least 40 seats, and hopes to add 40 more, and 140 on top of that, on a very good night. The plan is known as the 40-40-140 strategy.\n\nIts main policies are to bring about proportional representation, so smaller parties are better represented, and to allow votes for 16-year-olds. The party has also called for reform of drugs laws, greater equality and environmental action.\n\nThe Lib Dems need an election before Brexit happens as their revoke policy would no longer apply after we have left.\n\nGoing to the polls at this point would also mean the Lib Dems can capitalise on Labour's division ahead of Brexit and Mr Johnson's failure to leave by October 31.\n\nLabour is split between its Leave-backing heartlands in the North, the Midlands and Wales, and its younger Remain-backing voters in big city centres.\n\nIt has therefore adopted a fudged position, calling for a second referendum on a deal that it has pledged to negotiate.\n\nBut after Brexit, the party will be able to get back to domestic issues, which it claims helped it do better than expected in 2017.\n\nSpeaking in Parliament yesterday, Miss Swinson acknowledged that due to a lack of support for a second referendum, an election was the next best outcome.\n\n'We need to see the path forward, and if it is not going to be through a People's Vote, if there is not the support for a People's Vote in this Parliament, then we need to look at the other way to do that, and right now that is through having a General Election,' she said.\n\n'We have to act, we cannot just wait, because my fear is that either the Government pushes ahead with their Withdrawal Bill and it is delivered and delivers Brexit on the back of Labour votes, or that we end up in January, a couple of weeks away from the deadline of crashing out without a deal, and find ourselves in the same precarious position.\n\nBut that time the EU says, 'I'm sorry we've extended, we've extended again, and we cannot keep doing so if you do not find a path to resolve this'.'\n\nYesterday, Miss Swinson confirmed that conversations were taking place with the Greens and Plaid Cymru for a Remain alliance, according to Sky.\n\nShe said 'stop Brexit' candidates would be favoured in seats but added that the vast majority of seats will have a Lib Dem candidate.\n\nSecond referendum for Scottish independence \u2018will be at the heart of Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s SNP manifesto and any coalition dealings with Labour\u2019\n\nNicola Sturgeon will put the SNP\u2019s push for a second independence referendum at the heart of her election campaign.\n\nThe first minister of Scotland said that her party\u2019s message would be \u2018clear, simple and unambiguous \u2013 vote SNP to demand independence and secure Scotland\u2019s right to choose\u2019.\n\nThe Scottish nationalists are confident of picking up a string of seats from both Labour and the Conservatives.\n\nAt present they have 35 MPs \u2013 down from the 56 they picked up at the 2015 general election \u2013 their high water mark.\n\nIf Jeremy Corbyn fails to secure a Labour majority, it is likely he would be forced to ask the SNP for their support in propping up his government.\n\nThat means he may have to sign up for a second independence referendum in 2020 \u2013 six years after the last one. At her party conference in Aberdeen earlier this month, Miss Sturgeon was explicit that in the event of a hung parliament her party would make having another independence ballot an automatic condition for gaining the SNP\u2019s support.\n\nWhile she insisted her party would \u2018never put the Tories into power\u2019 her message to Mr Corbyn was: \u2018If you don\u2019t respect Scotland\u2019s right to choose our own future at a time of our own choosing, don\u2019t even bother picking up the phone\u2019.\n\nMr Corbyn said on a recent trip north of the border that there would be \u2018no pacts with any other party\u2019.\n\nYesterday the SNP\u2019s Westminster leader Ian Blackford welcomed an election. He said: \u2018We on these benches are simply not prepared to sit back and allow Scotland to be taken out of the European Union against its will.\n\nSo on that basis, Mr Speaker, I welcome the opportunity of an election, because make no mistake, the election that\u2019s coming is going to be the right of Scotland to determine its own future.\u2019\n\nEarlier he told BBC Scotland that if Brexit went ahead a referendum on independence would be an insurance policy \u2018making sure we stay in Europe\u2019.\n\nHe added: \u2018We want to see Boris Johnson defeated and out of No 10.\u2019", "description": "The Liberal Democrats will target Remain-leaning seats in London and the South West as they try to pick up voters unhappy with Labour's divisions and Tories' commitment to leave the EU.", "authors": ["Claire Ellicott Political Correspondent For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/00/20354058-0-image-a-12_1572395216578.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
