The city\u2019s poorest residents are most at risk in the heat\n\nThe hellish future of Las Vegas in the climate crisis: 'A place where we never go outside'\n\nThe hellish future of Las Vegas in the climate crisis: 'A place where we never go outside'\n\nThe Clark county death investigator Jill Roberts vividly recalls the sunny 115F (46C) afternoon last summer when she entered a Las Vegas home with no functional air conditioning. The indoor heat felt even worse than the broiling temperature outside. She climbed up the stairs, through thick, stifling air, landing in a third-story bedroom where the resident had died in sweltering conditions. The room had no fan and the door was shut. It felt as if it couldn\u2019t get any hotter.\n\n\u201cOur elements are unforgiving. Especially on those 115F days, it doesn\u2019t take a lot,\u201d Roberts told the Guardian. \u201cIn that situation I\u2019ll go stand in the sun in the 115F heat to do my paperwork as opposed to staying in the house because it\u2019s that hot.\u201d\n\nThe coroner\u2019s office in Clark county, which encompasses Las Vegas, often records heat as a contributing factor to accidental deaths. There are hikers succumbing to lethal temperatures in the surrounding desert and heat-related deaths in cars and homes when occupants forgo cooling. Roberts has seen homeless people with post-mortem burns from collapsing on hot streets.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Chris Mitchell, wearing a Darth Vader costume, pours water over his head to cool off along the Las Vegas Strip on 20 June 2017.

A June study of coroner data by the Las Vegas-based Desert Research Institute found a correlation between heatwaves and heat-related deaths in southern Nevada, both of which, they say, are on the rise. And a recent Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) report warns that without global action to reduce carbon emissions, the city will probably experience 96 days of heat above 100F by the end of the century, including 60 days over 105F, and seven \u201coff the chart\u201d days that would break the current heat index.\n\nEvery city has its own challenges in adapting to climate change, even those that are supposedly accustomed to severe heat. In Las Vegas, a laissez-faire attitude toward growth has allowed high temperatures to become even more deadly, and the scorching heat now threatens the city\u2019s basic functionality.\n\nLike the tourist guzzling alcohol by the resort pool, smiling and flirting until he faints from dehydration, southern Nevada has welcomed unfettered development since the 1930s \u2013 the advent of the home cooling era \u2013 when its population began to double in size nearly every decade despite limited water resources and increased drought. The resorts have long been the economic driver. Over a third of the area\u2019s workforce is supported by the 40 million visitors a year who descend on their gargantuan hotel towers, bustling casinos and massive convention halls. And as tourism grows, so does the population.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Southern Nevada has welcomed unfettered development since the 1930s.

Outward growth also led to vehicles motoring further across the sprawling metropolis, increasing heat-trapping carbon emissions.\n\nNow, with growth having continued each year since 2011, and new home developments returning to boom-era levels, Sin City is reckoning with a future that looks downright hellish.\n\n\u201cThe thing about Vegas is, we always do feast and famine,\u201d said Tick Segerblom, a former state senator who now sits on the Clark county commission, which governs the Las Vegas Valley. \u201cWe never bother to say, \u2018Where are we going? What are we doing?\u2019\u201d\n\nDuring summer months, when Las Vegas city buses break down notoriously often, many pedestrians carry umbrellas to protect their skin, and those without cover often \u201cshadow walk\u201d, following the shade of palm trees, signs and buildings to avoid direct exposure to a sunshine that can cause humans to overheat.\n\nThe city\u2019s poorest residents are most at risk. Fans and cooling systems can save lives, said Jill Roberts, the coroner office investigator, \u201cbut some people just don\u2019t have the funds to fix their air conditioning or have working equipment\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ricki McElwee walks with a bag of his ice on his head to cool off, 25 July 2018, in Las Vegas. Photograph: John Locher/AP\n\nHundreds of homeless people living in the city choose to camp in storm drains rather than sleep above ground \u2013 another dystopian irony to the city\u2019s reputation for glitz and glamor. Those who dislike the tunnels often have to work hard to stay cool. Marcy Averett, 49, and her husband spend 15 hours a day collecting recyclables. But each day before they set off, they buy ice.\n\n\u201cI have to have cold water. I don\u2019t know how people do it with hot water,\u201d she told the Guardian on an August afternoon as she dragged a shopping cart filled with aluminum cans out of the blistering sun, into the shade of a highway overpass. An orange cooler hung from the side of her cart. Averett had a spray bottle to mist her face and neck, and applied lip balm as we spoke. \u201cI put medicated moisturizer on my lips constantly, all day every day, and my lips are still cracked. It\u2019s this heat.\u201d\n\nLike many other rapidly warming cities across the United States, Vegas has only recently begun to reckon with its future.\n\n\u201cThe real question is, do we want a place where we just go from our houses to our cars to our offices, and never go outside because it\u2019s too hot?\u201d Segerblom, the former state senator, asked. \u201cHow many months of the year is that tenable?\u201d\n\nRachel Licker of the Union of Concerned Scientists warned that southern Nevada\u2019s productivity and essential services will become increasingly stressed as temperatures rise \u2013 construction projects will slow or stop more frequently to ensure worker safety; police and postal workers may be affected; and since studies show schoolchildren perform worse as temperatures rise, teachers may need to adjust testing schedules and standards for days if not months at a time.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ashawn Rabb, five, runs through a fountain of water at the Red Ridge kids water park, in Las Vegas, in June 2013.

Planting more native trees and shrubs, enforcing energy-efficient building standards, zoning to promote upward rather than outward growth, and developing alternatives to blacktop roads and concrete sidewalks are all policies that could have a major impact.\n\nTo lessen its own carbon footprint, the city of Las Vegas began powering all government buildings and streetlights with renewable energy in 2016. The state\u2019s largest energy consumers, the multi-thousand room hotels and casinos on the Strip, have also made environmental sustainability a priority in recent years. MGM Resorts has over 20 acres of solar panels atop the Mandalay Bay convention center, and much of the electricity flowing through properties like the Bellagio, Luxor and New York, New York comes from a solar array in the Mojave Desert.\n\n\u201cWe do feel it\u2019s our responsibility to find innovative ways to use less energy and procure clean energy for our resorts,\u201d said Mark Campbell, MGM Resorts\u2019 executive director of sustainability. The company also donates unserved banquet food to a local food bank and uses smart thermostats to avoid cooling vacant rooms.\n\nFor their part, Nevada voters passed a ballot initiative requiring state utilities to get 50% of their electricity from renewable sources by 2030. As a constitutional amendment, the proposal needs to pass a second time to take effect. But state lawmakers made that vote moot by adopting the standards on their own, on Earth Day 2019, through a legislative bill that received unanimous support. Nevada is rare state now in which reducing carbon emissions has become a bipartisan concern.\n\nIn seeking more access to clean energy sources, the state hopes to get ahead of the dilemma posed by longer and more intensive air conditioning seasons that amount to more greenhouse gas emissions spewed into the air.\n\n\u201cHeat is currently the top killer for weather-related hazards in the United States,\u201d said Licker. \u201cThose kinds of numbers would just get worse if we\u2019re headed toward really significant climate change.\u201d", "description": "Las Vegas is the fastest-warming city in the United States.
