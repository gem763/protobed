But ideas for growing the innovation economy remain in short supply.\n\nAnd while each of the parties has voiced support for innovative firms, the policies they\u2019ve unveiled to date do not include significant new programs or funding for those that are growing quickly.\n\nFrom big tech to data privacy and stock options, The Logic has broken down the key promises on innovation from the Conservative Party, the New Democratic Party (NDP) and the Green Party, as well as the Liberal Party\u2019s promises\u2014and the decisions it made in its first term in government\u2014to highlight how they would affect startups and firms in fast-growing sectors.\n\nBig Tech\n\nThe Green Party\u2019s Elizabeth May was the only one to mention Big Tech at the first leaders\u2019 debate in early September. \u201cWe don\u2019t tax Google or Facebook\u2014they take billions out of this economy,\u201d she said, in response to a question about how she would fund a promise of a guaranteed livable income.\n\nWhat they\u2019re proposing: Big Tech Greens: The party\u2019s platform includes a corporate tax on \u201ctransnational e-commerce companies doing business in Canada\u201d that will require firms to \u201cregister, collect and remit taxes where the product or service is consumed.\u201d It will also require social media platforms to only allow users with \u201cverifiable identities,\u201d in order to prevent harassment and the spread of misinformation. NDP: The party is proposing \u201ca national working group to counter online hate and protect public safety, and make sure that social media platforms are responsible for removing hateful and extremist content before it can do harm.\u201d It will also require digital media companies to pay the same taxes and make the same contributions to Canadian content as Canadian broadcasters. Conservatives: Leader Andrew Scheer said the party will ensure that content creators receive more of the revenue that currently goes to social media platforms like Facebook and Google, which sell advertising against their content. Liberals: In May, the current government released a digital charter, a set of high-level principles that will guide legislative changes if the Liberals are re-elected. It states that Canadians can expect platforms not to spread hate, violent extremism or criminal content, and that companies will be penalized if they violate the new rules.\n\nThe current government, under the Liberals, has participated in international policy discussions on measures similar to those proposed by the Greens.\n\nIn June, G20 finance ministers including Canada\u2019s Bill Morneau agreed to come up with new international taxation rules by 2020. They will require large multinational firms to pay taxes in the country where they make sales, even if they are headquartered elsewhere, or pay an agreed-upon minimum rate on their global earnings.\n\nMeanwhile, the NDP has focused on the tech giants\u2019 content-moderation practices.\n\nMelanie Richer, director of communications and media, said the party will pass laws to \u201cdesignate large, significant platforms as social platforms, with specific, legislated responsibilities,\u201d citing the recommendations of the House ethics committee. In a December 2018 report, the committee called for legislation \u201cimposing a duty\u201d on platforms to take down \u201cmanifestly illegal content in a timely fashion.\u201d An NDP government will enforce the rules through escalating fines.\n\nTalking Point The major parties in this federal election want to change the way innovative companies in fast-growing sectors are funded, taxed and regulated. But they\u2019re making those promises with consumers in mind, while offering little help to companies trying to scale up.\n\nLiberal leader Justin Trudeau has also said social media platforms that violate the digital charter will face \u201cmeaningful financial consequences,\u201d but the current government has not announced what those would be. And, Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez said in July that if re-elected, the Liberals will require streaming services to host \u201cmeaningful levels of Canadian content\u201d and contribute to its creation.\n\nThe Green Party has not explained how its proposed verification process will work, or how it would enforce the rule. The party did not respond to The Logic\u2019s request for comment.\n\nWhile the Conservatives have not yet proposed new rules for social media content, party MPs Bob Zimmer and Peter Kent were among the most prominent members of the House ethics committee. The party did not respond to a question about whether it would implement the committee\u2019s recommendations.\n\nThe ethics committee also proposed new legislation allowing the Competition Bureau to consider \u201cnon-price effects, such as data-driven mergers\u201d when evaluating whether to let large deals proceed. No party has adopted that recommendation in its platform, although the digital charter\u2019s principles include \u201cfair competition in the online marketplace.\u201d\n\nGoogle Canada declined to comment for this piece. Colin McKay, head of public policy and government relations, said the company is ready to work with whatever government is formed after the election.\n\nFacebook declined to directly answer The Logic\u2019s questions. \u201cAs we\u2019ve shared before, new rules for the internet should protect society while also supporting innovation, the digital economy and free expression,\u201d said Erin Taylor, communications manager for Facebook Canada, in a statement. She added that the company \u201cwelcome[s] conversations with policy makers and legislators.\u201d\n\nData\n\nIn an email to The Logic, Ben Bergen, executive director of the Council of Canadian Innovators (CCI), a lobby group representing growth-stage Canadian tech firms, called for all the parties to release data strategies that address \u201copen technologies, data sciences, competition, standard-setting, strategic regulations, trade agreements, algorithm ethics and IP.\u201d However, the parties\u2019 early proposals have focused on consumer privacy rights, rather than on how important data is to innovative businesses.\n\nWhat they\u2019re proposing: Data Greens: They will require \u201call government departments, companies, banks and political parties\u201d to report any data breaches. NDP: The party\u2019s platform includes no specific proposals on data. Conservatives: The party will require companies to provide \u201cplain language use agreements.\u201d It will also set up an expert committee to set \u201cbinding cyber security standards for critical infrastructure sectors,\u201d and penalties for failing to meet them. Liberals: The digital charter was accompanied by proposals for changes to the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), Canada\u2019s consumer privacy law, such as giving users the ability to share or transfer data, and to delete information they\u2019ve given to companies.\n\nThe Liberals\u2019 charter was the product of the National Digital and Data Consultations, which were conducted between June and October 2018. Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains told The Logic in April that the principles would \u201ccreate predictability and certainty for businesses.\u201d However, the charter doesn\u2019t contain new regulations, only guidelines that will influence those new rules.\n\nThere\u2019s little difference between some of the opposition\u2019s promised fixes on data and what the current Liberal ministry has proposed. The government\u2019s PIPEDA changes, for example, include a requirement that organizations provide plain-language information about how they use the data they collect; the Conservative proposal is very similar.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, some of the opposition\u2019s promised fixes on data are in fact already covered by existing laws, like the Green Party\u2019s reporting requirement. Government departments, companies and banks are already required to disclose a breach to the federal privacy commissioner if it includes sensitive personal information that could cause harm to those affected. The Green Party is also promising to \u201csignificantly increase\u201d the watchdog\u2019s powers, though it does not specify how.\n\nArtificial intelligence\n\nCanada is creating hundreds of AI startups. Firms in the subsector raised US$421 million in 2018, according to a report from PwC and CB Insights. But the space faces challenges, including a declining number of patents filed in the country each year between 2016 and 2018. Element AI, a Montreal-based firm whose executives are advising the government on AI and data standards, raised its latest investment round at a flat valuation, sources told The Logic. The company has struggled to launch products, and its staff has dropped seven per cent since March, LinkedIn data shows.\n\nWhat they\u2019re proposing: Artificial intelligence Greens: The party is proposing a tax on large companies equivalent to the income tax of workers who lose their jobs to automation, which will pay for retraining programs. It will also set up a parliamentary committee to make regulatory recommendations on the \u201cethical, environmental, social and economic implications\u201d of AI. NDP: The party\u2019s platform contains no specific proposals on AI. Conservatives: The Conservatives say they will create regulatory standards to ensure \u201cethical and secure [AI] use.\u201d It did not respond to The Logic\u2019s questions about what kind of rules it would implement, or to which uses and sectors they would apply. Liberals: In 2017, the current government launched a $125-million strategy focused on recruiting and retaining academic AI researchers. In May, it appointed an advisory council of tech executives and academics to identify ways to help the subsector grow.\n\nNone of the parties\u2019 proposals include specific measures to improve access to funding or increase patenting activity in the Canadian AI subsector, although the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research has appointed 46 new research chairs with funding from the Liberal government\u2019s AI strategy.\n\nOn the regulatory front, the country\u2019s leading AI companies are already promising to develop and deploy the technology ethically. In December 2018, the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al (UdeM) published a declaration on responsible AI development, the principles of which include ensuring that it does not discriminate against people for their ethnicity or sexual identity, and that automated decisions that affect people should be explained to them in plain language. Signatories include companies like Ottawa-based MindBridge Analytics, which makes AI-based auditing tools; UdeM\u2019s Mila, a research institute started by Yoshua Bengio, who also co-founded Element AI; and the Montreal branch of the NextAI accelerator.\n\nRegardless, Mike Murchison, CEO of Ada Support, a Toronto-based customer service chatbot platform with clients including Telus and Air Asia, told The Logic he believes governments should play a regulatory role in the ethical regulation of AI. He cited transparency regulations about informing people whether they\u2019re speaking to a human or an AI program, and rules to ensure that companies are using a diverse data set to prevent their algorithms from producing biased outcomes.\n\nWhile the Green Party\u2019s platform promises to make Canada \u201cthe global leader in AI development and regulation,\u201d it focuses heavily on imposing new rules, rather than fostering innovation. Murchison said the Greens\u2019 automation tax proposal targets the wrong kind of company. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want our customers to be taxed,\u201d he said. \u201cI would actually rather the onus be on the technology provider to \u2026 invest in reskilling and [be attuned to] these societal changes that the technology is producing.\u201d\n\nInnovation funding\n\nThe NDP and Conservative plans could mean the end of the Strategic Innovation Fund (SIF), the Liberal government\u2019s flagship funding program that has backed growth-stage Canadian companies like MindBridge; Vancouver-headquartered biotech firm Stemcell Technologies; and Waterloo-based quantum computing startup Isara Corporation.\n\nWhat they\u2019re proposing: Innovation funding Greens: The party\u2019s platform contains no proposals for business innovation funding or programs. NDP: The New Democrats will \u201crestore the Automotive Innovation Fund, create strategies focused on adding value and innovation for the high-tech, forestry, agriculture, aerospace and manufacturing sectors,\u201d said Richer. Conservatives: The Conservatives will cut $1.5 billion in \u201ccorporate welfare handouts.\u201d It also promised to review federal innovation programs to ensure they back firms \u201cwith patents, technologies and economic benefits that remain in Canada.\u201d Liberals: The party is proposing that the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) run a three-year pilot project to give up to $50,000 to a maximum of 2,000 new small businesses every year.\n\nIn the 2017 budget, the Liberals consolidated the automotive fund into the SIF, which is open to companies from any sector. Automotive firms have been awarded over $260 million from the new fund, or 12.9 per cent of the total, The Logic\u2019s analysis shows. However, the NDP is promising to reestablish it as a standalone program, arguing that its cancellation showed the Liberal government had \u201cgiven up on the auto sector,\u201d and that Ottawa should take a \u201csector-specific\u201d approach to innovation support. The NDP has \u201cnot taken a commitment for the rest of the SIF,\u201d Richer said.\n\nThe Conservative Party did not directly answer a question about whether it would eliminate the SIF if elected. \u201cWe will conduct a comprehensive review of all business subsidy programs \u2013 any corporate welfare that makes rich people richer will be eliminated,\u201d said Simon Jefferies, associate director of media relations.\n\nBut the party has expressed a desire to focus on Canadian innovation, which could affect the SIF. In February, The Logic reported that the program awarded just over half the $951 million it allocated between July 2017 and January 2019 to the Canadian subsidiaries of foreign companies, though all recipients are required to spend the money on domestic projects.\n\nA Conservative government review of the federal innovation support system would be the second in as many ministries. After a year-long study, the Liberals cut up to two-thirds of the federal government\u2019s 92 innovation-support programs in the 2018 budget.\n\nThis election, the Liberal Party is connecting its proposed $50,000 grant program to small firms\u2019 role as \u201cCanada\u2019s largest employers.\u201d Small businesses employed 69.7 per cent of private-sector workers in 2017, according to Statistics Canada.\n\nThe funding would also address a significant concern for BDC, the country\u2019s largest early-stage technology investor. In June 2018, it told The Logic it was concerned about a decline in the number of new IT companies founded in Canada.\n\nThe grant could \u201chave a very material impact\u2014it\u2019s effectively angel funding,\u201d said Murchison, noting that he raised about $50,000 for Ada\u2019s first round of financing. The median size of an angel investment round in Canada in 2018 was $120,000, according to the National Angel Capital Organization, an industry group.\n\nThe Liberal proposal marks a shift from the approach they took in their first term, which saw them refocus R&D- and commercialization-support organizations, like the Industrial Research Assistance Program and Sustainable Development Technology Canada, on larger projects for growth-stage firms, and order the regional development agencies to \u201cplace greater emphasis in helping firms scale up.\u201d\n\nThe party did not respond to The Logic\u2019s request for comment on its innovation policies.\n\nStock options\n\nThese proposals have focused on the deduction as a way to pay for their spending promises. But Canadian tech firms have expressed concerns that implementing these policies could hurt their ability to hire staff.\n\n\u201cOur members rely on [stock-options plans] to attract and retain the highly-skilled talent needed to expand their companies globally,\u201d said the CCI\u2019s Bergen. \u201cWhen only 1% of Canadian companies grow beyond 500 employees, the government\u2019s priority should be on seeing more companies reach this pinnacle of success instead of penalizing those who do.\u201d\n\nWhat they\u2019re proposing: Stock options Greens: The party is promising to \u201cclose tax loopholes that benefit the wealthy,\u201d citing the stock-option deduction\u2014which allows taxpayers to claim income from options at the lower capital-gains rate\u2014as one example. NDP: The party is proposing to tax 75 per cent of capital gains\u2014the difference in the price for which you buy and sell a house or security\u2014up from the present 50 per cent, which will reduce the size of the stock-option benefit. It will also eliminate the deduction for employees at \u201cbig companies,\u201d said Richer. Conservatives: The party did not answer a question from The Logic about whether it will maintain the scheduled cap. \u201cWe\u2019ll have more to say on these topics as the campaign continues,\u201d said Rudy Husny, associate director of media relations, noting that the party has not yet released its full platform. Liberals: The 2019 federal budget imposed a $200,000 cap on the options taxpayers can claim at the capital gains rate.\n\nSome of the parties have included carve-outs for such firms. The Liberal plan will not apply to employees of \u201cstart-ups and rapidly growing Canadian businesses,\u201d although the government is still determining which companies will qualify for the carve-out. A three-month consultation on the matter ended in mid-September; in April, The Logic reported that publicly traded scale-ups will be exempt.\n\nRicher said the NDP recognizes that \u201coptions help start-ups and growing businesses attract talent for competitive levels of compensation,\u201d and will maintain the deduction for \u201csmall and medium enterprises.\u201d Federal programs typically define such companies as one with 500 or fewer employees, meaning staff at fast-growing firms like Shopify and Ceridian would lose the tax benefit. When asked if the NDP would use this definition, Richer said it would work with startups to ensure the changes don\u2019t hurt their ability to hire.", "description": "Big ideas to bolster the economy are in short supply", "authors": ["Murad Hemmadi", "Hanna Lee"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Federal_party_leaders-1024x683.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
