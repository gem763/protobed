And 82 percent of people think robots can do things better than their managers\n\nThe team administered an online survey to full-time employees ranging from 18-74 years old across 10 different countries.\n\nAnd included in the study was a variety of HR leaders, managers and employees.\n\nAfter combing through answers and combing the data, the team found that 64 percent of people would trust a robot more than their manager and half have turned to a robot instead of their manager for advice.\n\nWorkers in India (89 percent) and China (88 percent) are more trusting of robots over their managers, followed by Singapore (83 percent), Brazil (78 percent), Japan (76 percent), UAE (74 percent), Australia/New Zealand (58 percent), U.S. (57 percent), UK (54 percent) and France (56 percent).\n\nIt was also found that more men (56 percent than women (44 percent) have passed over their manager for AI.\n\nAnd 82 percent of people think robots can do things better than their managers.\n\nHOW DOES ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE LEARN? AI systems rely on artificial neural networks (ANNs), which try to simulate the way the brain works in order to learn. ANNs can be trained to recognise patterns in information - including speech, text data, or visual images - and are the basis for a large number of the developments in AI over recent years. Conventional AI uses input to 'teach' an algorithm about a particular subject by feeding it massive amounts of information. AI systems rely on artificial neural networks (ANNs), which try to simulate the way the brain works in order to learn. ANNs can be trained to recognise patterns in information - including speech, text data, or visual images Practical applications include Google's language translation services, Facebook's facial recognition software and Snapchat's image altering live filters. The process of inputting this data can be extremely time consuming, and is limited to one type of knowledge. A new breed of ANNs called Adversarial Neural Networks pits the wits of two AI bots against each other, which allows them to learn from each other. This approach is designed to speed up the process of learning, as well as refining the output created by AI systems.\n\nWhen asked what robots can do better than their managers, survey respondents said robots are better at providing unbiased information maintaining work schedules, problem solving and managing a budget\n\nHowever, employees did note that their managers were better at understanding their feelings, coaching them and creating a work culture.\n\nEmily He, SVP, Human Capital Management Cloud Business Group, at Oracle said,\n\n'The latest advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence are rapidly reaching mainstream, resulting in a massive shift in the way people across the world interact with technology and their teams.'\n\n'As this study shows, the relationship between humans and machines is being redefined at work, and there is no one-size-fits-all approach to successfully managing this change.\n\n'Instead, organizations need to partner with their HR organization to personalize the approach to implementing AI at work in order to meet the changing expectations of their teams around the world.'", "description": "A global survey has found that more than 60% of employees prefer to interact with AI than their human mangers -- and 82% feel the technology does a better job with helping them.", "authors": ["Stacy Liberatore For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/19/19754884-0-image-a-38_1571165044258.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
