The ball is not allowed to be kicked more than ten metres in the air; penalties kicked in to touch cause a change of possession. It is rugby, just about, but certainly not as you know it. This is Rugby X.\n\nIt is the brainchild of Ben Ryan, Olympic gold medal winning coach of the Fiji Sevens team, and one of the pre-eminent thinkers in the game. Ryan is not a man with delusions of grandeur for the event \u2013 in fact, you got the sense he\u2019d have been rather more content with a low-key launch at a school in central London.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

And then for the entry, developmental level, to have a contact version of the sport in Rugby X that is very simple, that requires the least amount of technical knowledge of any format \u2013 you can play it anywhere!\n\n\u201cThe Caribbean have already contacted us and talked about running this because of the lack of pitches, as an entry level to propel them into the sevens game. The prison service we have talked with, local councils have talked to us, some of the youth games. There is a lot of interest.\u201d\n\nIt is a smart, and necessary, idea, but you couldn\u2019t help but feel those words rung slightly hollow as Ryan talked deep in the bowels of the O2. There was a strange disconnect between his outline for what Rugby X can be, and what the crowd were provided with at the event.\n\nWith the tagline \u201cit\u2019s rugby, accelerated\u201d, it was always going to be fast. But what could not quite be prepared for was the fire, fury and the frenzy, rugby accelerated to the point where most were simply clinging on for dear life. The games came too close together, the tries too often, and the rule changes made the action hard to follow at times. A laissez faire approach to officiating didn\u2019t help matters.\n\nThe unfamiliarity of the format was perhaps best underlined by England\u2019s lack of celebration at the conclusion of the women\u2019s final, decided by a one-on-one series of tie-breakers at the end of a drawn game \u2013 the players did not realise they had won by scoring a third consecutive point in attack, and were preparing another defender. It seemed the players weren\u2019t quite fully up to speed on the format, either.\n\nGiven the relative anonymity of the combatants, certainly to the wider sporting world, and you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find out what actually happened from anyone who attended, and particularly the details. Even Rob Vickerman, ex-sevens star and a true expert on the game, at times struggled to keep up while doing an admirable job shouting out try scorers from pitchside. Substitutions came often and in a sweeping manner and the most ardent of sevens followers were struggling to keep up with the changes in personnel as players came and went before patterns could develop. In the end, Argentina won the men\u2019s competition, and England the women\u2019s.\n\nYou\u2019d be forgiven for feeling a little lost in what was an incredibly artificial atmosphere. There was a coordinated, relentless attack on your senses from the word go: flashing lights and flamethrowers to gee things up; up-tempo pop music blasted at every conceivable opportunity; on-pitch \u201centertainment\u201d from a man in a bedazzled jacket to make even an inebriated aunt at a wedding cringe.\n\nIt didn\u2019t seem to have occurred to anyone that, in actuality, the rugby held people\u2019s attention. A little bit of time to reflect and catch your breath between games without music blaring or lights flashing wouldn\u2019t have gone amiss. A half-time is something to consider, too, if only to add a degree of structure and break things up a touch.\n\nThe timing was odd, too. Rugby X found itself plonked in the middle of Rugby World Cup Final week, ostensibly to piggy-back off of the tournament\u2019s popularity, but existing more as a weird aside to events in Japan. Will anyone actually remember Rugby X after this weekend?\n\nOrganisers may point to the matinee session (which was healthily attended, though not close to full) as a real sign of potential growth \u2013 a good portion of this early crowd were children, enjoying some half-term entertainment.\n\nAnd while some oohed and aahed at the more audacious offloads that a fine set of players produced during the afternoon, the loudest the children ever got was to count down to zero at the end of each game. That seems precisely the sort of engagement such an event is trying to avoid. Figures of 92 or 93 per cent capacity were touted ahead of the later session, but there were more swathes than smatterings of empty seats throughout the evening.\n\nParticularly in the early games, before teams had fully sussed how to defend in the new format, it seemed tries were able to be scored rather simply; a wide pass, one tackle half-slipped through, one well-timed offload. While there is a certain pleasure in a basketball-style end-to-end thriller, it is not demanding to want more meat on the bone, more substance to complement the style. The better games of the night were those that were slightly more messy and inaccurate, those where defences found a degree of parity, and teams truly had to work for their tries. The women\u2019s games stood out in this manner \u2013 the physical capabilities of the players seemed closer, and the games were better for it. The England-USA final was an outstanding contest.\n\nSo that was Rugby X, which is, for now at least, more spectacle than sport. It is exactly the sort of harmless fun that pervades sport, which is fine, but should we not yearn for more? If Ryan and like-minded people truly believe this can fundamentally change rugby, this was not, perhaps, the event to convince the naysayers.\n\nThe future of the format seems relatively easy to forecast. Ryan is really driving this as rugby for the community, for those who do not regularly get the opportunity to play the game, and in that sense it has real potential. The prison service links are incredibly intriguing, and the idea of introducing it to schools who do not provide rugby as part of their sporting curriculum something that has been required for a long while. Rugby has consistently failed to access such populations and it remains a game predominantly played by the elite. It would be a better sport if that was not true.\n\nThe event? That\u2019s harder to say. It is a crowd-pleaser, no doubt, but relatively expensive, and plagued with the familiar problems such events have \u2013 overpriced food and drinks, endless queueing, etc. But there are also real problems with the lack of attachment the crowd seemed to feel to the teams. How do you expect to keep the crowds coming back if they feel no connection to the players? Is it simply an event at which kids can while away the half-term hours, and the after-work city folk can engage in cathartic drunken reverie, or is it something more?\n\nUSA Men\u2019s Head Coach Mike Friday compared it to Masters Football, the relatively short-lived indoor footballing venture that saw ex-players trundle around uncomfortably at increasingly sparse arenas. Hardly lavish praise, but perhaps that is what Rugby X the event will ultimately become, a novelty sideshow with faces old rather than faces new to add a degree of familiarity, to grab the casual fan. I suspect a celebrity game may be floated (engagement for such events are generally quite good) to try and access a different sort of fan. Greg O\u2019Shea of Ireland, who I understand won a programme called Love Island, was the most popular and widely-recognised player on show, which is perhaps indicative of what the event truly was.\n\nAnd that\u2019s a real shame, for there were some magnificent players on show, outstanding athletes who seemed, unfortunately, secondary to the pomp and circumstance. As one remarked to me afterwards, it was \u201can experience\u201d.\n\nBut the future of rugby? I have my doubts.", "description": "In to the O2 Arena\u00a0the crowds came, more than willing to escape a chilly late October evening for the promise of potential \u2013 a new format of rugby was to be introduced, one that certain corners of the rugby world had pronounced as the future of the game.", "authors": ["Harry Latham-Coyle"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/30/12/rugby-x-general.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
