All those who are into motorbikes, they crash like I did,\" he said, grimacing and moaning while sat in the back of a car beside Go.\n\n\"I can't bear it, it's around my belt area (waistline), about three inches. It's really painful,\" added the president, who Go said was on his way back to the Philippines.\n\nPanelo said the pain was \"a consequence\" of the motorcycle accident that the presidency said Duterte had suffered on the palace grounds.\n\nThe leader fell off his vehicle just 10 days after he publicly revealed that he has myasthenia gravis, which causes muscle weakness and can result in drooping of eyelids, blurred vision as well as weakness in a person's extremities.\n\nQuestions over his health have swirled since he took office in 2016, with Duterte at times skipping events and meetings or discussing his various ailments in long and rambling speeches.\n\nHe has previously said he used to take fentanyl, a potent opioid painkiller, because of a spinal injury caused by other motorcycle accidents when he was younger.\n\nAccording to Duterte, his doctor made him stop using fentanyl on learning he was \"abusing the drug\" by using more than the prescribed patches.\n\nDuterte has also said he suffers from migraines and other illnesses including Buerger's disease, which is characterised by inflammation of blood vessels, usually due to smoking.\n\nDuterte will see his neurologist Wednesday after flying back to Manila late Tuesday, while his daughter Sara Duterte Carpio will represent him at the emperor's banquet late Tuesday, Panelo said.\n\nThe Filipino leader attended Naruhito's enthronement ceremony earlier Tuesday using a cane to help him walk, he added.\n\nSenator Go also released a photo of the president sitting down with his forehead propped up by a cane.\n\nThe Philippine constitution requires the handover of power to the vice president if the leader dies or is incapacitated.\n\nHowever Panelo said Tuesday \"the public can rest assured that there is nothing to worry about as regards the physical health and condition of the president\".", "description": "Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, suffering from \"unbearable pain\" in his spine after a motorcycle accident, is cutting short a trip to Japan, his spokesman said Tuesday.
