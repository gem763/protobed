Very grateful for patience of all affected in distressing circumstances \u2014 Dr Antony Stokes LVO (@embAntony) September 24, 2019 Report\n\nSue Petrow said she and other guests had refused to pay extra charges demanded by the hotel.\n\nHolidaymakers like Sue may have paid for their rooms and meals months in advance, but hotels would normally only receive the money from Thomas Cook several weeks after their stay.\n\nReports suggested there was widespread concern in Cuba over whether the industry insurance fund Atol, which covers payments in the event of a firm failing, would foot the costs.\n\nThe fund covers bills that have been run up since Thomas Cook's collapse on Monday morning.\n\nHowever, bills run up at hotels before Thomas Cook's collapse will not be covered. Affected hoteliers will have to apply to the liquidators for their money.\n\nCounting costs\n\nDame Hutton said the CAA had issued guarantees for payment to 3,000 hotels around the world, and had already started making the first payments. The CAA had 200 staff working with Thomas Cook employees, she added.\n\n\"Given how much those hotels are owed by Thomas Cook, it's hardly surprising that they are suspicious and angry,\" she said.\n\nThomas Cook owes hotels \u00a3338m, with one hotel in Mexico owed \u00a32.5m, she added.\n\nThe Insolvency Service has written to local tourist boards to make sure hotels are working with the CAA on payments, Dame Hutton said.\n\nRepatriation\n\nOn Monday, the CAA launched the UK's largest peacetime repatriation operation to bring more than 150,000 people back to the UK after the collapse of the holiday firm.\n\nSo far, more than 95% of people have been brought back on their original day of departure, the CAA said.\n\nOn Tuesday, 70 flights brought back more than 14,000 passengers, it said. There are 70 flights scheduled on Wednesday, bringing back a further 16,500 people.\n\nThe flying programme will continue until 6 October with more than 1,000 flights planned.\n\nRichard Moriarty, chief executive of the CAA, said: \"I would like those remaining on holiday to enjoy the rest of their stay because we aim to also fly you home on the day when you were originally booked to fly with Thomas Cook, or very shortly thereafter.\n\n\"This remains a highly complex operation and I would like to thank holidaymakers for their patience as some inconvenience and disruption is likely.\"\n\nHow are customers protected?\n\nIf you are on a package holiday, you are covered by the Atol scheme.\n\nThe scheme will pay for your accommodation abroad, although you may have to move to a different hotel or apartment\n\nAtol will also pay to have you brought home if the airline is no longer operating\n\nIf you have a holiday booked in the future, you will also be refunded by the scheme\n\nIf you have booked a flight-only deal, you will need to apply to your travel insurance company or credit card and debit card provider to seek a refund\n\nWhat are your rights? Read more here.\n\nThe CAA has set up a dedicated website to keep Thomas Cook customers updated with the latest advice and news.\n\nIt is running a call centre and Twitter feed with open direct messages to respond to holidaymakers 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nThe call centre can be reached on 0300-303-2800 inside the UK and +44 1753-330330 from abroad.", "description": "The Civil Aviation Authority says flights have been arranged to get Thomas Cook holidaymakers back.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1308B/production/_108936977_suepetroe.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
