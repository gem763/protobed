It showed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi looking like a winner, cigarette in one hand, cocktail in the other, rocking a gold-flecked chiffon gown and surrounded by shining gold statuettes.\n\nOnly the face was actually Pelosi\u2019s, however. It had been Photoshopped onto the body of actress and writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge pictured at an Emmys after-party celebrating a very good night. But the feeling of female power the Pelosi meme projected as it was forwarded again and again \u2014 that was not about the Emmys, but about politics.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an intense hunger for a female superhero right now, and the showdown between the most powerful woman in the country and the most powerful man is potent symbolism,\u201d said Jo Piazza, author of \u201cCharlotte Walsh Likes to Win,\u201d the bestselling book (and soon to be Amazon original starring Julia Roberts) that Piazza says she wrote in the first place to fill a post-2016 \u201cneed for portrayals of powerful women who aren\u2019t afraid of their power.\u201d\n\nWomen who study women agree that this week marks a moment. But because the biggest takeaway of recent years is that American women are not of one opinion, there are any number of interpretations of what that moment is about.\n\nSome envision Pelosi, D-Calif., all but wearing a cape and taking on a man who has shown more than a little disrespect to women in his personal life. She has been celebrated for this before \u2014 sarcastically slow-clapping Trump at his State of the Union speech, tapping her shades into place while exiting the White House after a showdown with him over the border wall, and chastising the president for having a \u201ctemper tantrum,\u201d one of the many times she treated him like a flailing toddler.\n\nOthers, though, just see a woman \u2014 a person \u2014 doing her job. Time was when this would have been a big deal, says Judith Warner, currently a journalism fellow at the Reflective Democracy Campaign and a longtime analyst of women\u2019s issues, who wrote the first biography of Hillary Clinton, in 1993. In 2007, when Pelosi became the first woman speaker in history, \u201cshe was still an emblem of change,\u201d Warner says. \u201cBut she\u2019s now one of many, many more women in politics in general, in Congress more specifically, and \u2018woman warrior on behalf of women against a powerful man\u2019 is not the first framing that comes to mind.\u201d\n\nWarner and others also note that there are women on both sides of the aisle \u201cpushing against\u201d Pelosi. On one side are the white women who voted for Trump in 2016, and his defenders in the White House, in Congress and on Fox News. On the other, the insurgent progressives in Pelosi\u2019s own party who believe she has been too slow to embrace the call for impeachment and view her as not leading the charge but reluctantly following it.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi and President Trump.
