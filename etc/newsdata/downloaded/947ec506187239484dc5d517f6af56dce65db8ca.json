She was the prime minister who is likely to go down in history for ultimately failing to reach the summit of her own personal Matterhorn.\n\nYet in her first public interview since leaving Downing Street \u2013 at a book festival in where she was asked about what book she might now find the time to write \u2013 Theresa May revealed that it was the dark rumours surrounding how four of Edward Whymper\u2019s climbing party fell to their doom that most appealed to her.\n\n\u201cA number of people sadly died on the way down and there is a question as to the rope that was used. Why it broke is an interesting question,\u201d said May, to laughter from an audience at the Henley literary festival for a talk about her career and the books that had inspired her.\n\nAnyone seeking a parallel to her own ill-fated attempt to drag the Conservative party towards a difficult Brexit deal may be struck by the Guardian\u2019s 1865 account of the accident, in which it is reported that after the leader of the expedition decided to press on to the summit against the expectation of others in the group, one of the party slipped and dragged three others to their demise.\n\nSpeaking as the Conservative party conference took place in Manchester, May did not point out any similarities, but suggested that her interest writing a real-life 19th century whodunnit set in the Alps was a combination of her love of detective novels and walking near the Matterhorn with her husband.\n\n\u201cI suppose because we like walking in the Alps I might like to write something about that,\u201d said May, after vigorously shaking her head when asked if she was planning to write a memoir, or had kept diaries while in Number 10.\n\nZermatt celebrates centenary of Matterhorn's first climb: from the archive, 17 July 1965 Read more\n\nInterviewed for an hour by Olympic gold medal-winning rower Dame Katherine Grainger, nothing had changed when it came to May\u2019s famous reticence. Her stack of cookbooks now numbered 150 but she couldn\u2019t name a favourite. She also hadn\u2019t read David Cameron\u2019s recently published memoirs. Instead, detective fiction in the form of an Inspector Montalbano novel was currently beside her bedside.\n\nOne of the more striking revelations about a book that had shaped her centred on Rachel Carson\u2019s Silent Spring, the 1962 text that is sometimes credited with laying the foundations of the modern environmental movement.\n\nMay had not read it but said that it had shaped her mother\u2019s thinking. May said: \u201cI know that my mother was very taken by it and it impacted on her, and that sort of fed through to me. In a sense it was quite unusual for vicar\u2019s wife in north Oxfordshire to read a controversial book like that but I am very glad that she did.\u201d\n\nRather than awakening May up to a radical green agenda, however, Silent Spring seemingly had a more abstract effect of making her \u201ccognisant of the environment in which you are operating\u201d while also showing the impact a book could have.\n\nAdding that she didn\u2019t believe her mother would have been \u201cdemonstrating on the streets\u201d, May expressed regret that not enough attention had been paid to the issues raised by Carson.\n\n\u201cI always say now that on climate change, my husband and I enjoy walking in Switzerland in the Alps and there is one particular place where over the years we have been going there we have been seeing the glacier retreating year by year and you just think: something is happening, something is changing here and we need to think about how we manage it.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, one of the few moments when May was questioned about contemporary controversies came when she was asked if she was surprised by the reaction to her honours list, which bestowed a knighthood on Geoffrey Boycott, the the former England cricket captain.\n\nThe honour sparked controversy owing to his conviction in a French court more than 20 years ago for assaulting his then girlfriend.\n\n\u201cWell I put my honours list together believing that there were people who I believed should be honoured in that way,\u201d said May, shifting uncomfortably in her seat.\n\n\u201cThere was reaction in a variety of ways to my resignation honours. You just put together the names that you thought were appropriate.\u201d", "description": "Ex-PM says she would like to write novel based on ill-fated 19th century ascent of Matterhorn", "authors": ["Ben Quinn"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7760fe4028c98eefe78d85ee968ac9d9a044b4cb/13_0_3484_2091/master/3484.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b32854a1457739ae3071cd4dfa039946", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
