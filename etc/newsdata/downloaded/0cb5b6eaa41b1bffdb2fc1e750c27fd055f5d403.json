It\u2019s an insult to all of these people, and the suffering they\u2019ve weathered, to frame the ballcarrier in the Beltway\u2019s latest partisan power contest as a whistleblower.\n\n\u2026\n\n\u201cHe or she\u201d [the individual who filed a complaint with the ICIG] was instantly celebrated as a whistleblower by news networks and major newspapers.\n\nThat last detail caught the eye of Kiriakou, a former CIA Counterterrorism official who blew the whistle on the agency\u2019s torture program.\n\n\u201cIt took me and my lawyers a full year to get [the media] to stop calling me \u2018CIA Leaker John Kirakou,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s how long it took for me to be called a whistleblower.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\nActual whistleblowers are alone. The Ukraine complaint seems to be the work of a group of people, supported by significant institutional power, not only in the intelligence community, but in the Democratic Party and the commercial press.", "description": "Matt Taibbi writes that the federal bureaucrat who set off Democrats' impeachment inquiry does not deserve the \"whistleblower\" moniker.", "authors": ["Breitbart News"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1171142809-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
