Photo: courtesy of retailer\n\nHeading off to college has a way of wiping everyone\u2019s slate clean. No one cares if you were voted coolest, funniest, or best-dressed in high school, but moving forward, they might care if you have a video projector, comfortable seating, extra snacks, or, according to Stanford University senior Amanda Tu, Lord Jones CBD gummies in your dorm room. The things you use to decorate your dorm room can help curb homesickness, break the ice with fellow students, host fun parties that attract lots of students or potential new friends or, if that\u2019s not your thing, keep socializing to a minimum. When it comes to the latter, Reed College junior Zack Youcha advises against making video games a focal point in your room because they often attract lots of people and make it hard to kick them out. \u201cI had a guy who would just walk into my place and play PS4 without asking all the time. It was awful,\u201d Youcha tells us.\n\nWhile some may think that the clean slate that comes hand in hand with going to college is a bad thing, we see it as a major positive. Your four (or more) years on campus present the enviable opportunity to reinvent yourself. To help you self-reinvent in style, we asked Tu, Youcha, and 20 more intimidatingly cool and design-minded students from 19 universities across the country (and across the pond) to tell us about all the statusy stuff to bring to school so that you\u2019ll look like the big man \u2014 or woman \u2014 on campus. Read on for 33 things (excluding video games) that will help you make friends and influence people outside of the classroom, according to our cool college students \u2014 who, if you\u2019re interested, come from Yale, the University of Pennsylvania, Brown, Columbia, the University of South Carolina, Tulane, Haverford, Reed, George Washington University, Syracuse, Barnard, Boston College, Stanford, Eton/Imperial College London, Ohio State, Leeds University, Goldsmiths, Lehigh, Goddard College, and Philadelphia University.\n\nMood lighting\n\nNovelty Lights 25 Foot G30 Outdoor Patio String Lights with 25 Clear Globe Bulbs Nearly every student we talked to agreed that the quickest way to zhuzh up a sterile dorm room is to add soft lighting. More than half of our cool students \u2014 12, in total \u2014 say they use string lights to create mood lighting in their own rooms, or have seen some kind of string-light configuration (ranging from full curtains of twinkly fairy lights to remote-controlled, color-changing bulbs) in their friends\u2019 dorms. Daniella Isabel Apodaca, a senior at Columbia University, told us she hangs slightly larger globe-shaped string lights like these \u201caround my room every year.\u201d In addition to softening the often unflattering standard dorm-room lighting, she says the bigger exposed bulbs solve another problem: \u201cIf you want to sleep or watch a movie, but your roommate needs some light, usually having just the string lights on provides a happy medium.\u201d $17 at Amazon Buy $17 at Amazon Buy\n\nKohree 33ft 100 LEDs 16 Colors, USB Powered Multi Color Changing String Lights with Remote Stella Vujic, a sophomore at Yale, told us these remote-controlled lights give her the flexibility to quickly change a dorm room\u2019s vibe. \u201cI know several people that have string lights that can change color around their room,\u201d she says. If you\u2019re going for something chill and relaxing, switch them to white or warm yellow, and if you\u2019re \u201cfixing to have a party,\u201d switch them to blue or green. $16 at Amazon Buy $16 at Amazon Buy\n\nHimalayan Glow 1001 Table Lamps, Pink Salt Lamp In addition to string lights, Tu says that pink Himalayan-salt lamps are definitely a thing on her campus. \u201cI\u2019m hard-pressed to think of a single cool girl on campus who doesn\u2019t have one in her room. The glow is super mellow, they\u2019re not that expensive, and people have fun licking them when they are intoxicated.\u201d When we followed-up on the lamps\u2019 lickable appeal, Tu told us: \u201cI think every single person I\u2019ve talked to who owns or knows someone who owns a salt lamp has licked it once. It\u2019s not a trend so much as the intuitive thing to do, I guess.\u201d $17 at Amazon Buy $17 at Amazon Buy\n\nHeng Balance Lamp Gunner Park, a junior at Cornell who spent his summer interning at HypeBeast, first discovered this design-y but still affordable alternative to your standard desk lamp in a friend\u2019s room. He told us he was surprised that the sculptural piece \u2014 which would look just as nice in an adult apartment \u2014 didn\u2019t cost a lot more than the more run-of-the-mill desk lamps you can buy. $85 at MoMA Design Store Buy\n\nPhotos and art for a gallery wall\n\nFujifilm Instax Mini 9 Camera $50 (was $69, now 28% off) Once you\u2019ve secured your mood lighting, the next most agreed-upon way to inject style into your dorm room is through a gallery wall. Eighteen of the rising sophomores, juniors, and seniors we talked to say they like to use a mix of posters, framed art, and personal mementos and photos to do so. Many of the students expressed a fondness for using vintage-looking photographs, telling us about several different ways they get that aesthetic, including using affordable instant cameras or going even more low-fi with a cheap disposable one and drugstore prints. Lillie Walsh, a Junior at Goddard College, has a collection of old and new instant cameras that she uses to help decorate her dorm. \u201cI use my father\u2019s old Polaroid 600 from the \u201990s, and I also own a couple of Fujifilm Instax Mini cameras.\u201d Christel Langu\u00e9, who graduated from Lehigh University last year, also likes using instant cameras because they create photographs that are more lasting than the ones filling up her cell phone. \u201cOne thing that makes me sad about smartphones is that we take so many pictures and never look at them again. Polaroid walls are a fun way to make memories and not forget about them.\u201d If you do prefer using your smartphone as a camera and want to make prints of your digital images, our panel of cool students told us to check out Framebridge for affordable printing and framing, Parabo Press for customizing photos using retro filters and square formats, and Snapfish, which lets you print tons of photos cheaply and quickly through an app. $50 at Amazon Buy $50 at Amazon Buy\n\nFujifilm QuickSnap Flash 400 Disposable 35mm Camera Nicolas DeStevens, who graduated from Philadelphia University with a degree in fashion marketing last year, told us he has seen a lot of students using disposable cameras instead of instant ones. \u201cOne trend that is pretty big right now is using disposable cameras, like the \u201990s. Once the pics are developed, just stick them on your wall.\u201d $25 for 2 at Amazon Buy $25 for 2 at Amazon Buy\n\nSonic Editions Framed 1968 Muhammad Ali Print, 16'' x 20'' Carl Escoffier, a recent graduate of Leeds University who is about to start at Goldsmiths, recommends this framed limited-edition vintage print of Muhammad Ali to anyone who, like him, could use some help him with \u201cMonday morning motivation.\u201d $300 at Mr Porter Buy\n\nBuy Art For Less Violet Green and Red, 1951 no 6 by Mark Rothko 36x24 Art Print Poster A handful of students recommend buying poster versions of famous works of art, including Youcha, who directed us to this poster of a Mark Rothko painting. He says it will make you \u201cseem educated\u201d in addition to \u201cadding color to an otherwise bland room.\u201d $5 at Amazon Buy $5 at Amazon Buy\n\nField Studies Chromatic Crystal Grid Apodaca says her favorite posters come from artist Paul Baxendale, who shares his work on Instagram via the handle @fieldstudieseditions. She likes them \u201cbecause they add a modern, southwestern vibe to my room.\u201d This print is available in a bunch of sizes so you can tailor it to your gallery wall. From $50 at Field Studies Buy\n\nMotivated Wall Art Atlanta Poster Both Annabelle Williams, a senior at the UPenn, and her friend and recent UPenn graduate Shiv-Louis van de Ven told us that vintage-looking city maps are a great way add a touch of home to a dorm-room gallery wall. Williams directed us to this brand for its map of Philadelphia (where she hails from); that map is currently out of stock, but there are a ton of other available options, like this print of Atlanta. $16 at Amazon Buy $16 at Amazon Buy\n\nNice-smelling things\n\nMalin + Goetz Cannabis Candle Many dorms have rules against candles because they pose a fire hazard. But of the 14 students who say it\u2019s important to have something to mask dorm-room funk, candles were the most recommended thing to do so by far, with eight students telling us that scented candles are essential to creating an inviting atmosphere. \u201cYou really never want to be in someone\u2019s space if it\u2019s dirty or smelly,\u201d says Langu\u00e9, who suggests getting an essential-oil diffuser if your dorm doesn\u2019t allow candles (or you don\u2019t think you can sneak one in). Van de Ven likes this one from Malin & Goetz because of its \u201crich earthy notes that say style, not skunk.\u201d Vujic adds that, despite her campus\u2019s no-open-flame rule, in her experience, \u201cpeople just have candles anyway and hide them when it\u2019s time to check on dorms.\u201d $55 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nMuji Aroma Diffuser 11SS Ultrasonic Waves With Light For those who believe that rules aren\u2019t made to be broken, this essential-oil diffuser from Muji is another effective way to freshen dorm-room air. Three students, including Park (who has used this to mask the aroma of his frat house), say they prefer using electric oil diffusers because, while candles look nice, a diffuser does a better job at improving the scent of an entire room. $58 at Amazon Buy $58 at Amazon Buy\n\nP.F. Candle Co. - No. 21: Golden Coast Diffuser Another three students say they like reed diffusers, which freshen air through the slow evaporation of essential oils and require neither flame nor electricity. Theo Hales, a former Eton student and a current second-year student at the Imperial College of London, says that his reed diffuser was a worthwhile investment because it became an integral part of his dorm d\u00e9cor. \u201cI had a reed diffuser in my room for the last two years and the improvement was massive,\u201d he says. $28 at Amazon Buy $28 at Amazon Buy\n\nExtra seating\n\nWashed Corduroy Floor Pillow \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to have people over when the only seating options are the floor or crowding onto someone\u2019s bed,\u201d says Tulane junior Sanjali DeSilva, 1 of 12 students who mentioned extra comfortable seating as a must-have for dorm-room hangs. Six students said the best kind of extra seating is a structured floor pillow that can either be sat on or leaned against. Meg Schwieterman, a sophomore from the University of South Carolina with her own style blog, and Tu specifically recommended these square pillows from Urban Outfitters. Schwieterman says they\u2019re \u201cthe perfect extra seating to pull out when you have guests, like a beanbag\u2019s cool older sister.\u201d $49 at Urban Outfitters Buy\n\nBig Joe Large Fuf with Removable Washable Cover Floor pillows have not entirely replaced beanbag chairs in our cool students\u2019 dorms, however, with Hales and Vujic telling us they prefer them in their spaces. Hales says he uses his for hanging out or studying, telling us there\u2019s nothing quite like the feeling of crashing onto one at the end of a busy day. He suggests buying a few, so \u201cyou\u2019ve got plenty of space for friends to join.\u201d Vujic agrees, telling us she likes beanbag chairs because they\u2019re affordable and versatile. This extra-large model isn\u2019t the cheapest option, but it\u2019ll offer more support and the cover is machine washable. $110 at Amazon Buy $110 at Amazon Buy\n\nYour Zone Canvas Flip Chair Several students told us that the best type of extra seating is something that can fold out into a bed for sleepovers. Not all of them have room for such pieces, but DeSilva recommends this style, which she calls the \u201cperfect\u201d futon chair for her and her roommates. \u201cIt made it so easy to have guests over, and they could even spend the night, no need for the hassle of an air mattress,\u201d she explains. $99 at Walmart Buy\n\nConnected Stripe Rag Rug If you don\u2019t have room for extra seating, 12 students say putting down your own rug can be an alternative that doubles as a way to hide some dorm rooms\u2019 less than nice-looking wall-to-wall carpeting. \u201cPut down a rug!\u201d implores Schwieterman, who says the ideal style is one that\u2019s \u201ceasy to clean while still being soft.\u201d This rug, from Urban Outfitters, is the one she went with after \u201ca ton of research.\u201d Williams agrees that any rug is better than being \u201cbarefoot on linoleum or wood dorm floors.\u201d As does Dani Goodman Rabner, a sophomore at Barnard, who told us that covering up an \u201cugly linoleum dorm floor\u201d is key. She adds that bringing your own rug will \u201cmake you think less about how many other people have stepped on your floor before you.\u201d From $24 at Urban Outfitters Buy From $24 at Urban Outfitters Buy\n\nStylish storage\n\nFarm Plast Set of 6 Square Milk Crates While all of our students had something to say about cool-looking storage solutions, one recurring item stood out among their responses \u2014 plastic, multicolored milk crates. Three of the cool students we spoke to (coincidentally, all men) told us that plastic milk crates are a storage trend they can get behind. Both Park and Youcha say they like using milk crates for storage because they make your dorm room look cool in a kind of bohemian or utilitarian way, and they\u2019re actually super useful. \u201cYou can make bookshelves, fake dressers, stools, stairs, and Halloween costumes, and everyone will recognize you as modest, yet crafty and awesome,\u201d Youcha explains. DeStevens likes milk crates for their throwback appeal, as well as for how affordable and widely available they are \u2014 though, if you\u2019re looking to splurge, he suggested crates from cult-y artist collective\u2013cum\u2013fashion brand Braindead (which are currently out of stock). \u201cIf you\u2019re lucky, your parents will have some from the \u201970s in your basement that you can take,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if you have the money totally buy the Braindead milk crates.\u201d $57 for 4 at Amazon Buy $30 for 6 at Farmplast Buy\n\nStuff for entertaining\n\nWhile video games were somewhat controversial among our cool students, eight of them told us they either have a projector, know friends with a projector, or wish they owned one. As Caroline Tien, a senior at Haverford, puts it, \u201cYou can\u2019t go wrong with a projector,\u201d and having one will score you major cool points, whether you\u2019re hosting bigger groups or just your new best friend. This model comes recommended by Schwieterman, who says it\u2019s easy to \u201ctack a sheet up on the wall, make a batch of microwave popcorn, and host a movie night!\u201d\n\nPortable mini projector LED micro projector Pia Mileaf-Patel from Brown says she uses this inexpensive mini-projector, which hooks up to her Bluetooth speaker, to screen movies. Vujic agrees that the mini-versions are the way to go. \u201cThe smaller ones are definitely a thing for movie night,\u201d she says. $48 at Amazon Buy $48 at Amazon Buy\n\nThe status appliance\n\nFrigidaire Mini Refrigerator Hales told us that the tiny mini-fridge his friend sneaked into the dorms was a \u201cpower move\u201d because it circumvented the no-fridge rule in his dorm. And Youcha says that stocking one with a collection of rare sodas, like Surge or Cactus Cooler, \u201cwill impress people way more than any alcohol.\u201d They were two of the seven people who told us that mini-fridges are a coveted appliance for a dorm room, and also came recommended by several RAs in our comprehensive guide to practical dorm essentials. Strategist\u2019s resident Cool Guy, Chris Black, agrees that mini-fridges are a way to flex your d\u00e9cor know-how on campus. He recommends the extremely sleek-looking SMEG mini-fridge (with a $1,000 price tag that reflects its high design). But for something slightly more budget-friendly that\u2019ll still turn heads, consider this retro mini Frigidaire. $180 at Urban Outfitters Buy\n\nA nonschool hoodie or fleece\n\nChampion Reverse Weave Hoodie Sweatshirt Status hoodies \u2014 whether from expensive designer brands, streetwear labels, concert merch tables, or a vintage store \u2014 are popular among fashionable people of all ages, so we wanted to know more about the ones our cool students wear. Six of our panelists told us that they see more Champion sweatshirts on campus than any other brand. Bella Morford, a senior at Boston College, explains their appeal: \u201cStudents like them because they are simple, comfortable, and on the cheaper side.\u201d Another popular hoodie trend, according to Vujic, is to wear ones (whether new or vintage) from colleges that aren\u2019t your own. \u201cHonestly, a lot of people wear hoodies from other colleges. I guess when you\u2019re at school, everybody knows you go to Yale or wherever, so people don\u2019t wear Yale gear as much here. If people have a sister or brother who goes to another college they\u2019ll wear that college\u2019s sweatshirt.\u201d $60 at Urban Outfitters Buy\n\nShadow Hill Neon Out of Control Pullover Four students told us that their favorite nonschool hoodies come from Shadow Hill, another brand they often see on campus. Morford is a fan, as is Langu\u00e9, who says Shadow Hill hoodies are appealing because they\u2019re \u201caffordable\u201d and so soft that \u201cI literally sleep in it.\u201d Other brands mentioned for their hoodies include Kith, Seam, Bianca Chandon, Supreme, and Heron Preston. $95 at Shadow Hill Buy\n\nPatagonia Men's Retro Pile Fleece Jacket A few students said that Patagonia fleeces are universally beloved for their gorpcore appeal, especially at schools where the winters are really brutal. Park says that \u201cthe Patagonia fleece is very popular since it\u2019s functional, somewhat dorky, and appeals to everyone.\u201d Vujic also likes Patagonia, but says its quarter-zip styles \u2014 which she says are sleeker than the teddy-bear fleece \u2014 are more ubiquitous on her campus. $140 at Patagonia Buy\n\nOther essential gear\n\nBeyond hoodies and fleeces, our panelists told us about their favorite brands of some staple, non-gendered gear common on all college campuses, including backpacks, shower shoes, and water bottles. When it comes to backpacks, our panel of cool college students gave us a ton of great ideas for stylish and functional options. But the most mentioned and coveted backpack was the Fj\u00e4llr\u00e4ven Kanken, which six students told us is by far the one they see the most among style-minded students. \u201cGood God, they are everywhere,\u201d says Mileaf-Patel, who adds that she tends to see them in the khaki-green color, specifically. Tu agrees that \u201cthe No. 1 status backpack is definitely the Fj\u00e4llr\u00e4ven Kanken,\u201d but says she sees the above \u201cwarm yellow color\u201d more often. Cool students aren\u2019t the only ones noticing the Kanken \u2014 three RAs also mentioned it when we asked them about practical dorm-room essentials.\n\nAdidas Adilette Slides The overall most popular shower shoes, according to our student sources, are Adidas slides \u2014 specifically the black ones with the white stripes. As Tu puts it, \u201cAdidas slides are a trendier option for shower shoes, for folks who want to level up from basic Old Navy flip-flops.\u201d From $17 at Amazon Buy From $17 at Amazon Buy\n\nBirkenstock \u2018Essentials - Arizona EVA\u2019 Waterproof Slide Sandal Two of the students we spoke to, however, say they prefer wearing Birkenstocks EVAs in the shower, and have noticed an uptick in others doing the same. \u201cI wear plastic Birkenstocks, they\u2019re cute and I can wear them other places,\u201d says Morford. Vujic also told us that a lot of people on her campus have the EVA Birks, too. From $31 at Amazon Buy From $31 at Amazon Buy\n\nCrocs Unisex Classic Clog $35 (was $40, now 13% off) Both Park and Tu say they\u2019ve noticed the beginnings of a Crocs shower-shoe wave. Park explains the appeal: \u201cThey\u2019re really easy to slip on and off, and they also protect your entire foot from all that gross stuff. Plus, you can use them as lounge shoes once they dry.\u201d $35 at Amazon Buy $35 at Amazon Buy\n\nHydro Flask Wide-Mouth Vacuum Water Bottle - 32 fl. oz. Six students mentioned Hydroflask, the same water bottle that Strategist managing editor Maxine Builder swears by, as the hands-down \u201cit\u201d water bottle for college students. Tu says the brand is a \u201cclassic choice,\u201d and told us that most students cover their Hydro Flasks \u201cin stickers, of course,\u201d so there isn\u2019t one specific \u201cIt\u201d color. The RAs we spoke to for our other dorm-room guide agreed that Hydro Flask is a brand that\u2019s super prevalent on campuses. $40 at REI Buy\n\nS'well Vacuum Insulated Stainless Steel Water Bottle, 17 oz, Titanium $35 (was $42, now 17% off) A handful of students \u2014 five to be exact \u2014 told us S\u2019well water bottles are super popular, too. Park was one of them, noting that the brand\u2019s titanium bottle is one he sees a lot. \u201cA lot of people, including myself, have been using the S\u2019well titanium water bottle. It has a really sleek design, and it\u2019s really light.\u201d Like Hydro Flask bottles, S\u2019well ones were also mentioned by RAs in our companion guide. $35 at Amazon Buy $35 at Amazon Buy\n\nNalgene Tritan Wide Mouth BPA-Free Water Bottle Nalgene, the maker of what we declared the next status water bottle earlier this year, is considered the coolest brand by four students, including Escoffier, who says bigger is always better when it comes to water bottles, and describes his favorite Nalgene as \u201ca big-ass water bottle.\u201d The size comes particularly in handy after a late night partying, he adds. \u201cYou may think it\u2019s too heavy, but you\u2019ll thank me when you\u2019re hungover in your bed and realize there\u2019s still a good few glugs of water left in there.\u201d From $11 at Amazon Buy From $11 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
