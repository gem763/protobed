She began her strike following the deadly mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, which left 32 people dead within a single August weekend.\n\n\u201cThe news cycle would change, the conversation would die down, and I would go back to living my life,\u201d Stephenson recalled thinking that weekend.\n\n\u201cThere have been so many petitions and marches, and the change hasn\u2019t happened. For me it became more than a political issue, it was a moral issue.\u201d\n\nStephenson says she does not have as much \u201cskin in the game\u201d as other violence prevention organizers. She\u2019s never been personally impacted gun violence, and describes her community as a quiet and safe place to live. However, she doesn\u2019t think that this disqualifies her from being a part of the growing movement to address gun violence.\n\n\u201cThe whole country has been affected. We behave differently than we used to in the past,\u201d Stephenson says. \u201cYou might not be someone directly affected by gun violence, but I think we\u2019re all the person to take on this issue.\u201d\n\nStephenson says she will continue her hunger strike until she sees a \u201cgood faith effort from the government in the direction of keeping the public safe\u201d. In particular, she\u2019s urging lawmakers to take up the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019 which passed through the majority democratic Senate more than seven months ago. Democratic leaders and anti-gun violence advocates have been calling on Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell to call for a vote on the bill.\n\nStephenson says she\u2019s taking cues from civil rights protesters like the Freedom Riders, who rode across the south of the United States to protest segregated bus terminals, and the activists who were sprayed with fire hoses and attacked by police and their dogs in the mid-20th century.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a powerful way to say \u2018we\u2019re willing to die for our beliefs, we\u2019re willing to die to combat cruelty\u2019,\u201d Larry Solomon, a lecturer at San Francisco State University\u2019s College of Ethnic Studies says of the legacy of hunger strikes.\n\nMarch for Our Lives unveils sweeping gun reform agenda: 'The time is now' Read more\n\n\u201cWhen you protest on this level you\u2019re [saying] that we\u2019re fighting something so inhumane that we are willing to die for it,\u201d he continues.\n\nSolomon advised three of the four students who went on a 10-day hunger strike at San Francisco State in 2016 to protest budget cuts that would affect the College of Ethnic Studies. And although he is skeptical that Stephenson\u2019s strike will move the federal government into action, he believes that the value of this kind of action can go beyond policy.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t know what the legacy of any of these actions will be for a while,\u201d Solomon says of the different forms of activism around ending gun violence.\n\n\u201cWhen the history of gun control is written this may be a chapter of it,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt might be the thing that got a group of student activists to say \u2018I\u2019m going to do something too\u2019.\u201d\n\nNow almost a month and a half into the strike, Stephenson says she\u2019s \u201cfeeling cold all the time, and carrying stuff is more of a struggle\u201d. She\u2019s had to stop exercising, and is in regular contact with her doctor who is advising her to stop the strike and resume her regular diet.\n\nWhile her hunger strike has yet to get national attention, she says that the support she is getting from her co-workers, family, and local community is helping her continue her demonstration. She also says she\u2019s donating to pro-gun control congressional candidates and working with local chapters of gun violence prevention groups like Moms Demand Action.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t afford to sit on this and wait,\u201d Stephenson says. \u201cI\u2019m going to keep plugging away until something changes or [this hunger is] hurting me too much.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a regular person and I think that enough is enough. This is something that America can do better with.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "description": "Shai Stephenson began her protest after two deadly mass shootings in one weekend left 32 people dead", "authors": ["Aben\u00e9 Clayton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/048c958599ddc61871b791d3ff1f78fb1012dc98/0_142_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b9695c01dec58325ef190b3b87705f7b", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
