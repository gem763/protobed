Bogut is not popular in China after criticising Chinese swimmer Sun Yang. The crowd at a Boomers game in Shanghai last month booed every time Bogut touched the ball.\n\n\"When you are in the business of sport in China you need to understand the local culture and the taboos,\" says Johnny Lu, the chief executive of Beijing-based sports consultancy Chang Shi Sky Sports & Technology.\n\n\"You need to know what you can say and what you can't say. Sport can be a very vulnerable business in China because things can change very quickly.\n\n\"Every single Chinese person has strong feelings about this. You can't offend China on these issues of sovereignty.\"\n\nAndrew Bogut's criticism of Chinese swimmer Sun Yang was not well received when basketball's World Cup hit China. Getty\n\nAustralia's National Basketball League declined to comment. Other Australian sporting bodies active in China were also reluctant to discuss the issue.\n\nPrivately, some say sporting organisations are unprepared for the sensitivities of operating in China. Beijing has not hesitated to \"punish\" Australian companies when diplomatic ties have been strained.\n\nExperts say grappling with hyper-sensitive China can be confusing. Some Chinese basketball fans were privately critical of the decision by China's CCTV broadcaster to pull the games, saying it was an over-reaction. But it is easy to find sports lovers in China who have no issue punishing the NBA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMayers Wu, a 22-year-old university student, took a train from a neighbouring city to Shanghai this week for an NBA event where fans got to meet the players, only to find it had been cancelled.\n\n\"I\u2019m quite upset about it as I have been waiting for the event for quite a few months,\" she told AFR Weekend.\n\n\"However, nothing can be tolerated on the issue of state sovereignty. I believe China has done the right thing. We can miss a basketball match, but we can\u2019t lose our beliefs.\"\n\nShow must go on\n\nThere was no sign though that fans were losing their appetite for the game at a packed stadium in Shanghai.\n\nThere were few empty seats as thousands turned out to see the Brooklyn Nets beat the Los Angeles Lakers. While there were fewer promotional events during breaks as sponsors stayed away, the mood in the crowd was enthusiastic.\n\nA man who identified himself as Mr Zhang said he paid 15,000 yuan ($3100) for a VIP seat and flew from Beijing for the game. The 25-year-old interior designer said he had mixed feelings about coming as he was upset about the Hong Kong comments but was a huge fan and did not want to miss out.\n\nThe NBA is also copping it from fans and politicians in the United States who accused it of pandering to hyper-sensitive China.\n\n\"Brands who make geopolitical gaffes will increasingly have to wrestle with cultural sensitivities in China while ensuring consumers in their home markets don't see them as sell-outs,\" says Mark Tanner, the managing director of Shanghai-based marketing firm China Skinny.\n\nThere could be an upside for Australian sporting bodies treading on egg shells from the NBA fallout. Lu says if basketball, China's most popular sports, is out of favour then more people might start watching AFL.", "description": "China's backlash against American basketball this week is a wake-up call for Australian sports officials looking to break into the world's second-largest economy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7155%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_514%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/546ec42115d96b424f91fd5b2fa864354c15c996", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
