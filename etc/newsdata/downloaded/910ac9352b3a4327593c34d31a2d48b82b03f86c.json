Britain is set for a December election to try to break the Brexit deadlock.\n\nIt is expected the Irish government will stick with its preference for an election in May 2020.\n\nVaradkar\u2019s minority government, run via a cooperation deal with the main opposition Fianna Fail party, was supposed to last only until the end of 2018 but its lifespan was extended as Dublin took on a pivotal role in Brexit talks.", "description": "Ireland's prime minister on Wednesday ruled out holding a parliamentary election before Christmas, according to national broadcaster RTE.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446527850&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T11H", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
