While the Wall Street darling has taken steps to shore up GE\u2019s finances and largely stanched the flow of negative news, he\u2019s still dealing with many of the same problems that confronted him on his first day.\n\nThe deflating 12-month stock performance underscores the magnitude of the challenge Culp took on when he agreed to steer GE through one of the worst slumps in its history. The Boston-based maker of jet engines, medical scanners and gas turbines has struggled with a deep decline in its power-equipment business, as well as cash flow concerns, persistent insurance liabilities and debilitating debt.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there are a lot of people who have the capacity and credibility that Larry has,\u201d said Steve Tusa, a JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst and GE\u2019s highest-profile critic. \u201cBut it\u2019s a huge task to turn such a long-cycle business that is this levered.\u201d\n\nGE fell 1.8% to $8.78 at 10:39 a.m. in New York.\n\nPortfolio Revamp\n\nCulp, 56, has been aggressive. He sold GE\u2019s biopharmaceutical business to Danaher Corp. for $21.4 billion, divested a jet-leasing unit and unloaded part of GE\u2019s stake in Baker Hughes, bringing in fresh cash and easing investors\u2019 liquidity concerns.\n\nHe has also asked for patience, saying the turnaround effort will take years. In a note to investors Tuesday, Culp reflected on the achievements in his first year -- including improving operations and winnowing the portfolio -- while acknowledging that the balance sheet still needs work.\n\n\u201cSimply put, we have too much debt, and as I promised we are working to reduce it thoughtfully and soon,\u201d Culp said. At the end of the second quarter, GE had \u201cindustrial net debt\u201d of $54.4 billion, according to a regulatory filing.\n\nWith the progress GE has made, Culp said he\u2019s \u201cmore optimistic now than I was a year ago.\u201d The CEO will provide an update on the turnaround efforts when GE reports third-quarter earnings on Oct. 30.\n\nEarly Rally\n\nCulp came to GE with a gleaming resume, having boosted sales, profit and market value at manufacturer Danaher during his tenure there as its top boss. His surprise appointment as GE\u2019s first outsider CEO sparked a 17% rally in the shares during his first week.\n\nA reality check came quickly. In Culp\u2019s first earnings presentation several weeks later, he slashed the dividend to a penny a share, recorded a $22 billion charge related to the power unit and revealed expanded federal investigations of GE\u2019s accounting.\n\nThere may have been a mismatch of expectations initially as investors hoped for a quick fix to problems that will take time to resolve, said Deane Dray, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. After the stock decline late last year, GE climbed 23% in 2019 through Monday, slightly ahead of a Standard & Poor\u2019s index of U.S. industrial companies.\n\n\u201cHe was a storied CEO coming into a vortex of risk,\u201d Dray said. \u201cIt\u2019s been triage, but we\u2019re nowhere near the crisis that was going on when he walked in the door.\u201d\n\nTo-Do List\n\nCulp still has a number of tasks on his to-do list, including naming a new chief financial officer, wrapping up portfolio changes and fixing the power business, Dray said. A rebound in GE\u2019s share price could \u201ccoincide with the pace of turnaround in power.\u201d\n\nIn the long term, however, Culp\u2019s rescue attempt could weigh on results by leaving the company smaller and more constrained, said Bill Campbell, director of research for Paragon Intel, which analyzes new CEOs.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the earnings power of a post-divestiture GE?\u201d he said. \u201cThe market needs to start evaluating what the company can actually earn and how much cash they can generate once they divest all these businesses.\u201d\n\n(Updates with CEO note to investors in seventh paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Richard Clough in New York at rclough9@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Brendan Case at bcase4@bloomberg.net, Susan Warren\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- A year ago, General Electric Co.\u2019s investors cheered the appointment of Larry Culp as the right move to fix the broken company.But the payoff is taking time to materialize, with GE trading 19% below its level when Culp took the reins.
