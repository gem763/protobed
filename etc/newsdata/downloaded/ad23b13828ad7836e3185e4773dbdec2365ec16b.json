The Air Force this year alone has made 259 stops at the airport and stayed overnight 220 times, according to a Politico count.\n\nThe initial findings of the review did not specify how many of the stays took place during the Obama or Trump administrations, but the publication noted that Air Force crews made 95 stops at the airport and stayed overnight 40 times in 2015.\n\n\u201cAs a practice, we generally send aircrews to the closest, most suitable accommodations within the government hotel rate,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nThe hotel, which is described as a luxury resort on its website, offers rooms for about $250 per night.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
