He held his right shoulder lower than his left. The slightest turn of his head required a hard effort, starting at his waist.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t pick up my arm right now so I can\u2019t pitch,\u201d he said, and, \u201cI\u2019m as disappointed as I could possibly be.\u201d\n\nScherzer, with Stephen Strasburg the Washington Nationals co-ace, said he experienced minor neck spasms Friday and Saturday and awakened Sunday morning to discover the symptoms had worsened, to the point he was unable to dress himself. His wife assisted. On his drive to Nationals Park, he\u2019d texted teammate Joe Ross, his tentative replacement for Game 5, telling Ross the start would be his. The content of the text, Scherzer said, was, \u201cGet ready.\u201d\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nInto a series tied at two games apiece, then, the thunderbolt that one of the sport\u2019s finest pitchers would miss his scheduled start and was questionable to pitch in any capacity in the final two or three games. Scherzer received a Cortisone injection into the area \u2014 his right trapezoid, he said, was also affected \u2014 that doctors told him could require 48 hours to alleviate the pain.\n\nThe Nationals were to fly Monday to Houston. Game 6 is scheduled for Tuesday night, Game 7 for Wednesday night.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just hoping that the doctors are right,\u201d Scherzer said, \u201cand that something could be possible for Game 7.\u201d\n\nWashington Nationals starting pitcher Max Scherzer was scratched from his Game 5 start on Sunday.

Those injuries, he said, were not related to his current physical issues. He pitched earlier in the season with a broken nose, suffered in a bunting drill the day before, and expressed frustration Sunday he could not pitch through his current pain.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve dealt with other little neck spasms, little issues in the past, as well,\u201d he said, \u201cboth on the right and left side and I\u2019ve always been able to kind of address it and keep it from really getting out of hand. Unfortunately, this one got out of hand. \u2026 This is just a little thing that turned into a big thing that turned into a giant thing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a muscle spasm. In talking to the doctors here, the nerve that\u2019s in the neck is all jammed up. Thankfully, from the doctors, what they say, as long as I have no numbness coming down my arms or anything, you don\u2019t actually deal with anything serious, any long-term damage there.\u201d\n\nRoss pitched two innings in Game 3 of the World Series, his only postseason appearance. Strasburg is scheduled for Game 6. Game 7 would fall on regular rest for An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez, though the Nationals would almost certainly prefer to pitch Scherzer, if he is capable.\n\n\u201cI went around and talked to a bunch of the boys and explained what was going on,\u201d Nationals manager Dave Martinez said. \u201cThey were all upbeat. ...Every one of them said, \u2018We got this. We\u2019ll pick him up.\u2019\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Sidelined by a neck injury, Nationals ace Max Scherzer is left hoping he might be available for a possible Game 7 of the World Series.", "authors": ["Tim Brown"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/COKkW4N_9BT2my6s4CHdxA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zkmeRtSRdwStRD1nOwKwDA--~B/aD0zNDU4O3c9NTE4NztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/d1875ed0-f915-11e9-bdbf-acac7fb0bf74", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
