REUTERS/Susana Vera\n\nThe criticism was echoed by Thailand\u2019s army chief, who on Friday spoke of \u201chidden agendas\u201d in meetings between opposition activists.\n\nThe embassy statement, posted on its official Facebook page late on Thursday, came days after Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong posted a picture on social media with prominent Thai opposition figure Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit.\n\n\u201cSome Thai politicians have contacted the group that wants to separate Hong Kong from China, showing gestures of support,\u201d the embassy said in a Thai-language statement without naming individuals.\n\n\u201cThis is wrong and irresponsible. China hopes that relevant people will understand the truth about problems in Hong Kong, act carefully and do useful things for the friendship between China and Thailand.\u201d\n\nWong and Thanathorn met on Oct. 5 at the Open Future Festival in Hong Kong, attending as speakers at the annual event.\n\n\u201cUnder the hard-line authoritarian suppression, we stand in solidarity,\u201d Wong wrote in a tweet that showed a picture of him standing next to the Thai politician.\n\nThanathorn\u2019s Future Forward Party declined to comment when contacted by Reuters on Friday.\n\nThai army chief General Apirat Kongsompong indirectly criticised Thanathorn\u2019s meeting with Wong on Friday during a press briefing in which he accused opposition politicians of inappropriate behaviour.\n\n\u201cWong came to Thailand countless of times. To meet whom? The meetings had hidden agendas. Were they conspiring, cooking up something together?\u201d Apirat said.\n\n\u201cAnd with the incidents in Hong Kong, someone went, to give moral support, to give encouragement,\u201d Apirat added, showing the picture of Thanathorn and Wong that was posted on social media, though Thanathorn\u2019s body was blacked out.\n\nThailand was run by a military junta for five years after then-army chief General Prayuth Chan-ocha overthrew an elected government.\n\nElections held in July were won by Prayuth\u2019s pro-army party in a vote that opposition parties said was organised to ensure continuation of military control of politics.\n\nThe Thai Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the Chinese embassy\u2019s statement but referred to a statement in September stating that Thailand regards the situation in Hong Kong as China\u2019s internal affairs.", "description": "The Chinese embassy in Bangkok has condemned Thai politicians for showing support to Hong Kong activists amid mass anti-Beijing protests, saying that such move could harm the relationship between the two countries.", "authors": ["Panu Wongcha-Um", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439578079&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A0F4", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
