Interestingly enough, most of these stories are centered around women. Curl up in a warm blanket and let these ladies tell their terrifying stories.\n\nIn old Japan, samurai would play a game: The Hyakumonogatari Kaidan. They would sit in a circle of one hundred candles and every time someone told a story, one candle would be blown out. Once the final candle was blown out, the room would be plunged into darkness and a ghostly figure would appear.\n\nWhile I can\u2019t tell one hundred stories, here are seven of the scariest stories featuring female yurei (Japanese ghosts) and yokai (Japanese monsters and spirits) that you can tell your friends, maybe even your older and braver kids, as a spooky bedtime story.\n\n1. The Secret of the Yamamba\n\n\u00a9 Photo by natsuki_1811\n\nThe Yamamba look like harmless old women, but are actually terrifying mountain yokai that consume human flesh. One of their oldest legends is from the Konjaku Monogatari:\n\nOnce upon a time, a Buddhist priest was caught out in a storm but luckily passed by a lonely hut. A kind old woman invited him inside, welcoming him with food and a warm fire. As welcoming as she was, she gave the priest a strange warning: \u201cNo matter what, do not look in the back room.\u201d\n\nUnable to overcome his curiosity, the priest failed to heed the old woman\u2019s warning. As soon as she stepped out to gather more firewood, the priest peeped through a crack in the door. To his horror, he discovered the room filled with half-eaten corpses. The priest realized that the old woman was a Yamamba, luring unsuspecting travelers into her home only to shred them to pieces for her next meal. He fled from the hut as fast as he could and never looked back.\n\n2. The Legend of the Jorogumo\n\n\u00a9 Photo by zoe_marie_creations\n\nThe Jorogumo is a half-woman, half-spider yokai that can transform itself into a beautiful woman when hunting for unsuspecting men to devour!\n\nA young samurai was accosted in the street by an alluringly gorgeous woman. Although she was beautiful, the samurai saw through her disguise, realizing she was not a human but some kind of yokai. He immediately drew his sword and plunged it towards her, but only injuring the strange woman before she quickly retreated. The samurai followed the scarlet trail of spotted blood, all the way to an old, abandoned house. Inside, he found dozens of bodies bound in spider silk, and a giant Joro spider, dead from the injuries it had received.\n\n3. The Tale of Oiwa\n\n\u00a9 Photo by coolarttokyo\n\nNot all scary stories are made up\u2014The Tale of Oiwa is based on a real event that took place in 17th century Edo:\n\nOiwa was a stunningly beautiful young woman who was married to the samurai Iemon, a petty man who only loved her for her head-turning looks. Another woman, Oume, was madly in love with Iemon and out of jealous rage, she tricked Oiwa into using a cream that was laced with poison. It disfigured Oiwa\u2019s face, causing one of her eyes to droop and her hair to fall out, without her even noticing.\n\nDisgusted with her new appearance, Iemon wished to divorce Oiwa and marry Oume. The despicable samurai hired his friend Takuetsu to rape Oiwa, so that he would have the grounds for divorce. Takuetsu was so shocked by Oiwa\u2019s appearance, he couldn\u2019t follow through with the orders. Instead, he told Oiwa of Iemon\u2019s plan, and showed Oiwa her own face in a mirror. Seeing her deformed face for the first time, Oiwa was so horrified that she stole Takuetsu\u2019s sword, killing herself. With her last breath, she cursed Iemon\u2019s name.\n\nOn the night of Iemon\u2019s remarriage to Oume, the ghost of the disfigured Oiwa appeared before him. A terrified and guilty Iemon quickly fled from Oiwa, but no matter how far he ran, he couldn\u2019t escape her hauntings. After that night, no matter where Iemon looked\u2014even in the very lanterns he used to light his path\u2014he would see Oiwa\u2019s face staring back at him.\n\n4. The Woman of the Snow (Yuki-onna)\n\nThe Yuki-onna is a kind of snow spirit yokai. She usually takes the life of humans who wander into her frozen lands, sometimes even falling in love:\n\nA young man in search of his fortune was passing through the snow-covered mountains, when he\u2019s caught in a sudden snowstorm and loses his way. Nearly frozen to death, he almost gives up hope when a strange woman, covered in frost and with a face as pale as snow, appeared before him\u2014a Yuki-onna. Because he was still so young, the Yuki-onna took pity on him, and guided him to a warm cabin in the woods, saving his life. In exchange for his rescue, however, she made him promise never to tell anyone of their meeting.\n\nYears later, the young man met and married a charming girl named Yuki, and they lived happily together for many years. But one day, the young man told his wife about how he was once saved by the mysterious Yuki-onna, breaking his promise. As he reveals this tale to his wife, her face grew pale and frost began to cover her body\u2014his wife\u2019s true identity was the Yuki-onna. The promise broken, she vanished back into the winter\u2019s night.\n\n5. The Ghost of Okiku\n\n\u00a9 Photo by matthewmeyerart\n\nOkiku\u2019s story is sure to keep you up all night, and if it doesn\u2019t, her ghost will!\n\nThere was once a girl, Okiku, who lived in Himeji Castle as a servant of the samurai Aoyama. One of Okiku\u2019s tasks was to care for her master\u2019s collection of ten valuable plates. But one day, while Okiku was washing the plates, she realized one was missing. No matter how many times she counted, she always came up one short. Her master was so enraged that she had lost his plate that he threw her down a well.\n\nMurdered so brutally, Okiku\u2019s soul could not rest. Every night, her ghost crawled out from the well to continue counting her master\u2019s plates. She would count to nine, then, upon realizing that the tenth plate was still gone, she would let out an ear-piercing shriek. Okiku\u2019s screams kept everyone in the castle up all night long for weeks on end, until a Buddhist priest finally appeased her.\n\n6. The Black Hair\n\nThis thousand-year-old legend is one of the first terrifying stories within the kaidan:\n\nOnce upon a time, there was an impoverished samurai living in Kyoto with his wife. A wealthy lord from a distant land invited the samurai to be his vassal. Because it was such an honorable opportunity, he had no choice but to accept, leaving his wife to wait in poverty at home until he returned.\n\nYears later, having dutifully served his lord, the samurai finally returned to Kyoto. Although his house was in disrepair, his wife was still there to happily welcome him home. Finally reunited, the two spent the entire night talking and laughing together before drifting off to sleep. When the samurai awoke, the warmth he had felt just the night before from having his arms wrapped around his loving wife was no longer there. Instead, he opened his eyes to see that he was only holding a cold skeleton, shrouded in long, black hair.\n\nThe samurai learned that his wife passed away from sadness the summer before, but her skeleton had remained in the house all the while, waiting faithfully for his return.\n\n7. The Peony Lantern\n\n\u00a9 Photo by sixxonillu\n\nAlong with Oiwa and Okiku, Otsuyu is one of the three female ghosts that make up the \u201cNihon san dai kaidan\u201d or Japan\u2019s big three ghost stories:\n\nOne dark night, the samurai Ogiwara spotted an elegant woman carrying a peony lantern wandering through the streets of Edo. For Ogiwara, it was love at first sight. He invited the beautiful woman, Otsuyu, to accompany him home where they talked, laughed, and enjoyed each other\u2019s company. That night, Ogiwara\u2019s neighbor, hearing eerie laughter coming from Ogiwara\u2019s garden, peeked over the wall. He saw Ogiwara holding, not a woman, but a laughing skeleton! The next morning, Ogiwara\u2019s neighbor revealed to him what he had seen. Horrified, Ogiwara went seeking advice from the priest at a nearby temple.\n\nTo his shock, Ogiwara found Otsuyu\u2019s grave at the temple. He realized that the woman he had fallen in love just the night before with had died long before they had even met. Now that Ogiwara knew the truth, Otsuyu\u2019s ghost no longer appeared before him.\n\nEven after discovering the truth Ogiwara missed Otsuyu desperately. After some time, he could no longer bear his sadness and returned to the temple where Otsuyu lay buried. At the temple gates, Otsuyu appeared before him once more. Reaching out her hand, she asked Ogiwara to accompany her home. Without hesitation, Ogiwara took her hand, walking with her into the darkness.\n\nAfter his final visit to the temple, Ogiwara vanished. The priest, concerned, opened Otsuyu\u2019s grave. Inside the coffin lay two bodies: Ogiwara and Otsuyu, together forever.\n\nWhich of these stories do you find the spookiest?
