USA TODAY\n\nIn the aftermath of the Washington Nationals\u2019 Game 6 victory over the Houston Astros on Tuesday, all conversations are prefaced with the seventh-inning call that set the baseball world \u2014 and Nats manager Dave Martinez \u2014 on fire.\n\nTrea Turner was running to first base when reliever Brad Peacock\u2019s throw got to the bag the same time Turner did, and he made it to second with Yan Gomes standing on third following the play. But home plate umpire Sam Holbrook ruled Turner out for interference and Gomes returned to first. Had Anthony Rendon not homered two batters later to increase Washington's lead to 5-2, the call could have had more serious ramifications.\n\nOf course, controversial calls in the MLB postseason are nothing new. From fan interference to obstruction, playoff umpires have seen it all over the years.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the most controversial plays over the past 35 years in postseason history.\n\nFan interference call on Jose Altuve's 'homer'\n\nIn the first inning of last year's ALCS Game 4 between the Boston Red Sox and Houston Astros, a fan interference call prevented a potential game-tying, two-run home run for Jose Altuve.\n\nAs Red Sox right fielder Mookie Betts went back to the right field wall and reached for the ball, a frenzy of fans in the front row did the same. In doing so, the fans made contact with Betts\u2019 glove, preventing him from making the catch. Umpire Joe West called Altuve out on fan interference.\n\nIn a game that ended in an 8-6 Red Sox victory, the impact of the call was impossible to ignore.\n\nChase Utley\u2019s slide upends Ruben Tejada\n\nIn the bottom of the seventh of Game 2 of the NLDS in 2015, the New York Mets were trying to preserve their 2-1 lead with a pair of Los Angeles Dodgers on the bases and one out.\n\nPitcher Bartolo Colon hit a ball to Daniel Murphy just to the right of second base. Murphy flipped the ball to shortstop Ruben Tejada, who stepped on second and turned to get the inning-ending out at first. That\u2019s when Chase Utley, running from first base on the play, slid directly into Tejada, upending him and ending all chances of a double play. Utley was called safe after a review, when it was determined that Tejada never touched the bag.\n\nUmp calls infield fly rule on Andrelton Simmons\n\nWith one out and two runners on in the bottom of the eighth inning, the Atlanta Braves were threatening to chip away at the St. Louis Cardinals\u2019 6-3 lead in the 2012 NL Wild Card Game.\n\nBraves shortstop Andrelton Simmons hit a high pop up to left field that fell in between Cardinals fielders Pete Kozma and Matt Holliday. As a result, the bases were loaded. That is until left field umpire Sam Holbrook ruled that Simmons was out on account of an infield fly. The MLB rulebook cites that an infield fly is in play if the ball could \u201cordinarily have been handled by an infielder \u2014 not by some arbitrary limitation such as the grass, or the base lines.\u201d However, the ball seemingly dropped closer to where the left fielder Holliday was originally positioned, not the shortstop Kozma.\n\nDespite the ball traveling well into left field, Simmons was called out on an infield fly, cutting the Braves\u2019 rally short. The Cardinals went on to win, 6-3.\n\nCardinals win on a walk-off obstruction call\n\nThe St. Louis Cardinals were tied 4-4 with the Red Sox in the bottom of the ninth of Game 3 of the 2013 World Series. St. Louis had runners on second and third with one out and a chance to take a series lead with a win. They got the walk-off they were looking for, just not in the fashion they might have expected.\n\nAllen Craig was ruled safe on an obstruction call against Red Sox third baseman Will Middlebrooks, who tripped Craig as he darted for home on a ball that sailed past third base. Umpire Jim Joyce called obstruction and Craig scored the game-winning run, despite never actually touching home plate.\n\nThe play marked the only time a postseason game has ever ended on an obstruction call.\n\nMatt Holliday slides, misses home plate\n\nMatt Holliday\u2019s slide into home in the 13th inning of a tiebreaking playoff in 2007 remains memorable.\n\nWith closer Trevor Hoffman on the mound and an 8-6 lead, the Padres were three outs away from a spot in the NLDS.\n\nThe Rockies tied the game on RBI hits from Kazuo Matsui and Holliday, when Jamey Carroll came to the plate with a chance to win the game.\n\nCarroll shot a liner into the glove of Padres right fielder Brian Giles, who made an impressive throw to home. Holliday slid, driving his hand into the foot of the Padres catcher. He was called safe by home plate umpire Tim McClelland, but it was unclear as to whether Holliday actually touched the bag.\n\nTo this day, there is no clear-cut evidence of Holliday actually touching the bag, so McClelland\u2019s word still stands. With the modern influence of replay review and better camera quality, one has to wonder how this play would have unfolded if it took place a decade later.\n\nThe Steve Bartman play\n\nThe Steve Bartman play in Game 6 of the 2003 NLCS lives on in baseball lore because of a no-call on fan interference, partially leading to the Chicago Cubs\u2019 blowing a late-inning lead and eventually the series.\n\nFlorida Marlins second baseman Luis Castillo sent a fly ball into foul territory along the left field line. Cubs left fielder Moises Alou made his way to the wall in time to make a play on the ball, when Bartman intercepted the ball before Alou could potentially make the catch.\n\nCubs shortstop Alex Gonzalez botched a potential inning-ending double play just moments later, and the Marlins poured on eight runs in the inning to go on to win the game as well as the series.\n\nMany in the stadium, including a demonstrative Alou, clamored for fan interference, which would have called Castillo out.\n\nJeffrey Maier helps Derek Jeter\u2019s home run\n\nJeffrey Maier became one of the most famous fans in baseball history when was on the receiving end of Derek Jeter\u2019s controversial home run in Game 1 of the 1996 ALCS.\n\nAs supported by multiple replay review angles, Maier reached over the right-field wall to haul in Jeter\u2019s fly ball, preventing Baltimore Orioles right fielder Tony Tarasco from making the catch below. Tarasco was directly under the ball and appeared to be right in line to make the catch, but Maier caught it first and the Yankees went on to win in extra innings, 5-4.\n\nUmpire Don Denkinger\u2019s blown call\n\nThere is little controversy about this one; Jorge Orta was out at first.\n\nThe Cardinals were clinging to a 1-0 lead heading into the ninth inning of Game 6 of the 1985 Word Series when the Kansas City Royals\u2019 Orta hit a slow grounder to the right side of the infield. First baseman Jack Clark fielded it and tossed it to relief pitcher Todd Worrell, who was covering first. Replays showed that Orta got to the bag after the ball got to Worrell, but first base umpire Don Denkinger called him safe.\n\nOrta was pulled for pinch runner Onix Concepcion, who scored the game-tying run as the Royals went on to win the game and later the series.\n\nContributing: Chris Bumbaca", "description": "Baseball is a game of intricacies and subjectivity.
