His response was an ambitious plan to modernize procedures that would also shave $5.2 billion off a projected $17.8 billion price tag. If successful, Thompson\u2019s plan meant that the 2020 count would come close to matching the $12.3 billion cost of the 2010 census.\n\nFour years later, those projected cost savings appear to be in serious jeopardy. Annual budgets have fallen far short of what\u2019s needed to fully implement Thompson\u2019s plan, and internal costs have risen.\n\nHanging in the balance is the fate of the census itself, the nation\u2019s largest civilian exercise, which is required by the U.S. Constitution. Thompson is also gone, and his 30 June departure has only added to the uncertainty at the government\u2019s oldest and largest statistical agency.\n\nThis story, as well as companion stories to be published this week on Science Insider, takes an in-depth look at the myriad political, technical, and budgetary issues that are confronting the Census Bureau, which generates some of the world\u2019s most widely used demographic data.\n\nA re-engineered census\n\nWhy does it cost upward of $12 billion to get simple demographic information\u2014age, gender, race/ethnicity, and household relationships\u2014about every U.S. resident? The answer lies in how the Census Bureau carries out the mandate it was given in 1789 to conduct an \u201cenumeration\u201d of every person in each state for the purpose of apportioning the number of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Over time, the government has come to rely on data from the census and its longer annual offshoot, the American Community Survey (ACS), to allocate half-a-trillion dollars through health, welfare, housing, infrastructure, education, and other federal programs.\n\nClose to two-thirds of the country\u2019s population is fairly easy to count, it turns out. That large cohort\u2014which probably includes anyone reading this story\u2014respond promptly to the agency\u2019s decennial query. But connecting with that final third of the population is what really drives up the cost. (The decennial census is actually a survey of the U.S. population and housing units, although that dual focus derives from tradition rather than from the original intent of Congress.)\n\nThompson confronted the challenge head-on by proposing to re-engineer the three major components of the census:\n\nthe master address file that underpins everything else;\n\nself-response rates; and\n\nthe massive workforce deployed to count those who don\u2019t respond to the agency\u2019s initial solicitation.\n\nTo pull off a complete and accurate 2020 nose count, that agency has to perfect what it calls \u201coperations and systems.\u201d There are some 35 of these, including internet and telephone systems for answering census questions, the traditional mail-in paper form, hand-held devices to help field workers track down those who haven\u2019t already responded, and the use of information obtained from other government agencies or third parties\u2014including geospatial data from satellites\u2014to update the master file of 143 million addresses. Some systems and operations have changed little since the 1970 census, Thompson notes.\n\nUpgrading those operations and systems for the 2020 census could save $5.2 billion, Thompson has estimated. It\u2019s a coincidence, he adds, that the figure conforms to a congressional directive to do the 2020 count at the price of 2010\u2019s. \u201cI never actually promised that,\u201d he says. \u201cI just knew we could do things more efficiently. And I wanted a number I could stand behind, not one that we just pulled out of the air.\u201d\n\nFalse savings\n\nHis strategy assumed that Congress would provide the funding in the years leading up to Census Day on 1 April 2020 to ensure that all of the moving parts meshed. But that hasn\u2019t happened. Since 2015, Congress has appropriated about $170 million less overall than the bureau has estimated it needs to stay on track for a modernized count. And the trend is going in the wrong direction.\n\nWill the big bucks be there? Tight budgets to date contrast sharply with what the 2020 Census will need in the next few years, according to a 2016 estimate from then-Census Bureau Director John Thompson.\n\nFor instance, the $800 million request from President Donald Trump for 2018 is $112 million below what Thompson had estimated 2 years ago would be needed for that year. And it appears likely that Congress will go along with that request, although it may not happen until well after the 1 October start of the next fiscal year.\n\nWith Census Day less than 1000 days away, Thompson says the agency is running out of time to recover from those skimpy budgets. The bureau \u201cis moving ahead to do a complete and accurate census in 2020,\u201d he asserts. \u201cBut Congress is, at some point, going to have to pony up the money that\u2019s needed to do a good census.\u201d\n\nWhat that means is spelled out in the agency\u2019s budget request to Congress for fiscal year 2017, submitted by the former President Barack Obama's administration in February 2016. The numbers may be scary to fiscal conservatives: $912 million needed in 2018, $2.05 billion in 2019, and $6.15 billion in 2020.\n\nThe good news, Thompson notes, is that those numbers are, respectively, $877 million, $1.6 billion, and $2.5 billion less than they would have been for those years absent a re-engineered census. But Congress shouldn\u2019t be looking for additional savings, he warns: \u201cThose numbers are not going down.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, its recent tight budgets have forced the Census Bureau to curtail, delay, or cancel several activities designed to test or implement improvements. In some cases, it has also meant ditching planned improvements and falling back on tried-and-true methods, including a method of first contacting millions of residents in rural and remote areas that Census officials had hoped to replace with a more efficient approach.\n\n\u201cAs with everything else, we have to balance the risk versus our mitigation approaches,\u201d Lisa Blumerman, associate census director and head of the 2020 Census, explained after a 11 July project management review, a quarterly update of the state of the 2020 census held at the agency\u2019s headquarters in Suitland, Maryland. \u201cOur focus is on procedures designed to ensure that we can conduct a complete and accurate census.\n\nCensus advocates don\u2019t blame the bureau for taking that cautious strategy. But they say the approach is penny-wise and pound-foolish. \u201cThe Census Bureau is inadequately funded,\u201d argued Representative Jos\u00e9 Serrano (D\u2013NY), the top Democrat on the House spending panel that oversees the agency, at a markup last month of a 2018 spending bill. \u201cThe Trump administration has shortchanged the important planning and testing tools that are needed now to prevent higher costs in the future. Without this crucial testing now, initial response rates will drop and costs will rise.\u201d\n\nBut his words, and those of other Democrats, fell on deaf ears. The panel\u2019s Republican majority rejected Serrano\u2019s amendment to add $384 million to the agency\u2019s overall $1.5 billion request. On 13 July the full appropriations committee approved a bill that would provide only a $51 million boost in 2018 for the account that includes the 2020 census and ACS.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t do any more\u201d\n\nThis fall the Census Bureau will issue a new estimate for overall cost of the 2020 census that will almost certainly be much higher than the earlier $12.5 billion price tag. But how much higher is anybody\u2019s guess. And some of the increase can\u2019t be blamed on Congress and the new administration: This spring Census officials disclosed that a new information technology system being used to manage the rest of the census\u2019s interlocking systems will cost at least $309 million more than initially budgeted.\n\nBut Thompson won\u2019t be around to find out the impact of those and other changes to his master plan. On 15 May he announced that he was stepping down as director and retiring from government on 30 June. (Thompson spent 27 years at the Census Bureau before joining the private sector in 2002, returning in August 2013 to lead the agency.)\n\nHe announced his departure less than a week after disclosing the IT cost overrun to congressional overseers. His boss, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, had already launched a review of all the cost estimates for the re-engineered census, saying he didn\u2019t have confidence in numbers generated by an appointee of the Obama administration.\n\nThe implied partisanship at the government\u2019s leading statistical agency may have been the last straw for Thompson. As director he made little headway in winning over conservative Republican legislators who have long complained that the 70-some question ACS, which in 2005 replaced the long form of the decennial census, is unduly burdensome and an invasion of privacy (see stories here, here, and here). And the agency\u2019s recent budgets have certainly complicated his plans for 2020.\n\n\u201cYou work and you work,\u201d Thompson told Science Insider last week, \u201cand at some point you take stock and you say, \u2018I\u2019m at the point where I\u2019ve done all I can do and I can\u2019t do any more.\u2019 It\u2019s time to go.\u201d\n\nThompson says Ross never raised the option of his staying on, although a 2012 law aimed at minimizing disruptions during the 10-year census cycle would have allowed Trump to appoint Thompson to a second 5-year term. (Thompson was 4 months into a 1-year extension of his first term when he announced his departure.)\n\n\u201cThe new person will be nominated by the current president and confirmed by the current [Republican] Senate,\u201d Thompson says. \u201cSo he or she will have a real mandate. I\u2019m not going to get into any finger pointing with Wilber Ross,\u201d adds Thompson, who this week started a new job as head of the Commission of Professional Associations on Federal Statistics in Washington, D.C. \u201cI respect him, and I know he wants to have a good census. And I\u2019ll leave it at that.\u201d\n\nCutting back\n\nRoss has appointed two highly respected career Census Bureau employees\u2014Ron Jarmin and Enrique Lamas\u2014to lead the agency until a permanent director is in place. But they will have limited clout in dealing with Congress and the White House at a time when the agency needs a strong advocate.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges facing any director is riding herd on the wildly fluctuating budget for the decennial census. Over the current 10-year cycle, for example, it will rise from a low of $66 million in 2012 to a projected peak of $6.2 billion in 2020. At the same time, the long ramp-up gives Census officials some leeway in scheduling the iterative tests needed to ensure the seamless integration of individual systems and operations.\n\nCensus officials have been able to use that flexibility to absorb initial budget shortfalls for 2020. But they hit the wall in September 2016, when Congress failed to pass a 2017 budget on time and instead froze spending indefinitely at 2016 levels. On 18 October, Blumerman announced that she was canceling two field tests scheduled for April 2017, one in Puerto Rico and one on two Indian reservations in Washington state.\n\n\u201cGiven the current uncertainty about FY [fiscal year] 2017 funding, the Census Bureau will not continue expending resources to prepare for the FY 2017 field tests, only to receive insufficient resources to conduct them,\u201d her memo reads. \u201cIt is a risk we are unwilling to take.\u201d Continued planning for the tests, she added, \u201cwould all but guarantee wasted efforts and resources.\u201d\n\nHer memo said that the agency still needs the information the canceled tests would have provided, and it raised the prospect of incorporating the tests into the final dress rehearsal for the 2020 census. Census officials had chosen three locations, with a combined 700,000 households, for the so-called End-to-End Census Test in April 2018. Each location offered a different set of characteristics that can be important in conducting the census. For example, Providence county in Rhode Island offered an East Coast, urban area with a varied population. Three counties in southern West Virginia represented a rural and mountainous setting. And Pierce county in southwestern Washington state featured a large military base.\n\nSix months later, however, Census officials decided that the full dress rehearsal would take place at only one site, in Providence. The news was revealed in the president\u2019s 2018 budget, and the unspoken but clear implication was that there wasn\u2019t enough money in that request to conduct a three-site test. At this month\u2019s project management review, Blumerman praised the demographics of the single remaining site and said, \u201cWe feel very comfortable that Providence county will allow us to test what needs to be tested in the End-to-End test.\u201d\n\nAn internet option\n\nThe 2020 census will be the first one that can be completed over the internet. Previous versions consisted of paper questionnaires\u2014some 400 million were printed in 2010\u2014that needed to be filled out and mailed back. The paper version will still be available, although the agency plans to print only 140 million copies this time around. And paper will still be the only option for some 10% of the U.S. population living in rural and remote areas or without mailable addresses. For the first time, the public will also be able to complete the questionnaire by calling a toll-free number that will be staffed by trained operators offering assistance in several languages.\n\nCensus officials hope that most people will choose the internet option. Over the past 3 years it has run small-scale tests of the cloud-based operation in several cities that have gone relatively smoothly. But those tests can\u2019t simulate what will happen after the census \u201cgoes live,\u201d when officials say the website could receive as many as 2 million simultaneous hits.\n\nThe key to a high self-response rate is publicity. The Census Bureau conducts a massive communications campaign in the run-up to every census with help from thousands of local and regional governments, civic organizations, and corporate partners. But Census officials have canceled the advertising campaign that was to accompany the 2018 dress rehearsal, citing a tight budget. That decision eliminates the only scheduled large-scale test of what public service messages and other outreach efforts are most effective in raising self-response rates, as well as the opportunity to tap some of those partnerships before the buildup to 2020.\n\nGetting good addresses\n\nAnother challenge facing the bureau is making sure it has reliable addresses. As part of preparations for the 2010 census, some 150,000 people walked more than 6.5 million kilometers to identify every housing unit in the country. For the 2020 count, Thompson has projected the agency could save almost $1 billion, and maintain its high standards, by tapping into readily available, high-resolution geospatial data. In particular, Census officials set a goal of having in-house employees verify 75% of the nation\u2019s housing units by poring over satellite imagery and other data from commercial mapping services.\n\nBut last fall, citing a shortage of funds, Census officials canceled the second phase of that two-step in-house exercise, the part aimed at resolving discrepancies that had been identified by an initial analysis. The Census Bureau estimates it will now need to physically verify 30% of the units, a rise of five percentage points. The Government Accountability Office has estimated that the additional field workers could cost an extra $22 million, although it says the agency hasn\u2019t tracked the current operations well enough to know how much additional canvassing will be needed in 2019.\n\nPuerto Rico has traditionally presented a special challenge because of its nonstandard system of addresses. The agency had scheduled a field test this spring involving 123,000 housing units in the San Juan area in hopes of resolving those differences. The exercise would also have tested local attitudes toward using the internet self-response option, as well as any logistical problems related to offering Spanish versions of all three self-response options.\n\nBut the Puerto Rico test was canceled because of the budget shortfall. Also canceled were two scheduled tests this spring on two Native American reservations in Washington state, that were designed to measure the agency\u2019s ability to use tribal enrollment data in enumerating residents as well as how the new electronic system of updating addresses works in areas without unique addresses.\n\nOff the beaten track\n\nAnother recent change with potentially significant budgetary implications involves the agency\u2019s interactions with some 12 million housing units in rural and remote areas. They are places without regular mail service and unique, city-style addresses, or those that are simply really hard to reach. These areas are not covered in the address canvass exercises done in advance of the actual census.\n\nIn past censuses, the first step was to have field workers update the list of housing units in their assigned blocks. Then they would knock on the door of those residences and hope that someone answers who is willing to be enumerated. If not, they would leave a note saying a census worker had been there and would be returning.\n\nThat operation was known as update/enumerate (U/E). One variation, called update/leave (U/L), involved updating the address but not knocking on any doors. Instead, the enumerator left a paper questionnaire, with a cover letter instructing the residents to mail it back.\n\nThe re-engineered census called for the elimination of U/L and the sole use of U/E in those areas. Only this time the field worker would verify or update the address electronically, presumably on a tablet, before knocking on the door. At that point, the census taker will leave information if no one is home, giving residents an option to respond through the internet or telephone, but also letting residents know that the census taker will return otherwise. The operation envisioned additional door-knocks for U/E households, unless the residents have answered the questions.\n\nHowever, this month Blumerman announced the agency had decided to scrap that plan and, instead, would restore U/L for all but 500,000 of the 12 million units. The major difference, she explained, was that field workers will not be doing any enumeration after updating the address. \u201cWe will simply be leaving the package,\u201d she said.\n\nBlumerman said she could not comment on the cost implications of the new approach, pending release of the new life-cycle estimate, nor whether cost was a factor in the agency\u2019s decision. But outside experts speculate that the agency may be banking on a high rate of self-response through the internet option, thereby reducing the percentage of households that would end up in the more costly nonresponse follow-up (NRFU) pool.\n\nThe proposed new U/E system was never tested in the field, notes Terri Ann Lowenthal, a census consultant and former congressional staffer based in Stamford, Connecticut, and that no such test appears in the revised schedule of remaining tests.\n\nAnother reason for its demise could be unanticipated logistical challenges. Atri Kalluri, who manages IT systems for the decennial census, told reporters this month that it isn\u2019t possible for field workers to do both update and enumerate operations on the same mobile device because they require different software platforms that can\u2019t run on the same device. He said census officials also don\u2019t want to burden field workers with carrying two different devices, that is, a tablet and a smartphone. So any enumeration would have had to be done the old-fashioned way, with paper rather than electronically.\n\nWhen they don\u2019t answer\n\nHigh self-response rates are the Holy Grail for census takers. But the reality is that rate has been dropping steadily, from nearly 80% in past decades to below 63.5% in 2010. And those nonrespondents are harder to find, thanks in part to economic disruptions and a growing population of immigrants.\n\n\u201cThere is undoubtedly a lot of distrust of government among the immigrant community,\u201d Thompson acknowledges. \u201cSo it\u2019s going to take a real effort, especially through the partnerships, to get the word out and explain to the community why it\u2019s important to be counted and that the census is confidential.\u201d\n\nThere are two major components of NRFU. One is being able to weed out bogus addresses, that is, those attached to housing units that are vacant or that don\u2019t exist at all. The second is getting the necessary information from valid addresses.\n\nThe Census\u2019s traditional approach to that challenge was through field operations. That requires not just workers\u2014600,000 in 2010\u2014but also the physical infrastructure\u201412 regional centers and nearly 500 local offices\u2014to manage them. The 2020 census hopes to cut those numbers in half, and save a projected $2.5 billion.\n\nSome of the savings will come through automating procedures like recruitment, training, and payroll. But the real innovation for 2020 is the use of so-called administrative records. That refers to all the demographic information already on file with U.S. government agencies.\n\nBy and large, those records won\u2019t obviate the need for people to answer the census because they are not sufficiently detailed to meet the bureau\u2019s data quality standards. \u201cRemember, they are not trying to do a census using administrative records,\u201d Thompson says. \u201cWhat they are trying to do is use administrative records where they can help the Bureau apply its resources more effectively.\u201d\n\nOne such application is in reducing the number of viable addresses. Thompson estimates that Census may be able to eliminate up to half of the country\u2019s vacant units\u2014some 14 million in 2010\u2014through the use of commercial and government records. That pruning, he says, will both reduce the number of units that enumerators must visit and improve the odds that someone will answer their knock on the door. In 2010, for example, enumerators visited a single address as many as six times in pursuit of the information.\n\n\u201cNo time to lose\u201d\n\nAlthough he\u2019s no longer in charge, Thompson says he has full confidence in the abilities of the current 2020 census leadership team. \u201cThey don\u2019t need me to do a good job,\u201d he says with a laugh.\n\nBut Thompson is deeply worried about forces beyond their control. \u201cThe FY 2019 budget will be really critical for the Census Bureau,\u201d he says. \u201cThey have been deferring and deferring things. But nothing can be deferred in 2019. There\u2019s simply no more time to lose.\u201d", "description": "Tight budgets are undermining plans to save $5 billion", "authors": ["Jeffrey Mervis"], "top_image": "https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/Census%20Story%20main%20image_rev.jpg?itok=NPd9Aloa", "published_at": "2017-07-24"}
