It\u2019s actually been a bust.", "language": "en", "text": "In reality, Trump\u2019s regulatory rollback has largely been a bust. In some cases, in fact, it\u2019s been an outright fraud: The Trump administration has added bureaucracy and uncertainty for businesses that it either willfully misunderstands or overtly dislikes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nConsider a list of Trump\u2019s major deregulatory efforts, many of which involve allowing companies to pollute more.\n\nYes, there are a few identifiable, isolated winners from this agenda. Like, imagine you run a company whose business model depends on dumping lead, mercury or arsenic into the water; pumping methane or fine particulates into the air; or using pesticides that give kids brain damage. Sure, recently loosened restrictions on these toxic activities might fatten your profit margins.\n\nBut whether such policy changes significantly boost the overall economy is a different question entirely.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne reason to distrust the administration\u2019s claims about these regulatory rollbacks: In its official cost-benefit analyses of such changes, it has used a lot of shady \u2014 one might say dishonest \u2014 assumptions. In other words, it\u2019s cooking the books.\n\nFor instance, in some cases it has thrown out solid scientific studies that happen to produce inconvenient results. In others, it has disqualified large categories of benefits historically counted in such assessments. It has also arbitrarily scaled back estimates for the social cost of carbon. And so on.\n\nThese are all wonky, technical accounting changes that go largely unnoticed by the public. That\u2019s by design. The goal is to make Trump\u2019s deregulatory efforts look like they\u2019re turbocharging the economy.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn fact, even some of the companies the Trump administration claims to be helping have protested that they\u2019re being harmed. As a result, several major deregulatory changes have faced opposition not just from the usual tree-huggers and public-health advocates, but from industry, too. That\u2019s been true for the administration\u2019s laxer requirements for methane and mercury emissions, as well as its automotive fuel-efficiency standards.\n\nIn those cases \u2014 as with the trade wars \u2014 the Trump administration seems plainly confused about what policies will be \u201cpro-business.\u201d In others, though, its regulatory changes seem deliberately anti-business. Or at least they seem designed to hurt certain disfavored businesses or populations.\n\nSuch as: legal immigrants and anyone who attempts to employ them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has stretched out processing times for visa approvals and begun demanding time-consuming new paperwork from employers seeking to hire skilled workers. For instance, employers have been asked to document every possible project a prospective immigrant employee might work on over the next three years.\n\nEven when such documents are handed over and approved, the agency has issued skilled-worker visas valid for periods much shorter than the standard three-year duration that employers have expected and planned around \u2014 instead granting visas good for as short as a single day. In at least one case, Citizenship and Immigration Services mailed out a worker\u2019s visa three weeks after it expired.\n\nMaybe the agency is just incompetent. But these kinds of policies, alongside skyrocketing visa denial rates, seem intended to make life more expensive and uncertain for skilled immigrants and the companies that depend on them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhich is a shame, given research suggesting that making the U.S. skilled-immigration system more restrictive has the unintended effect of pushing jobs and innovation outside of the United States.\n\nMost of these immigration-related policy changes have taken place secretly, without going through the notice-and-comment rulemaking process required by law. That\u2019s despite Trump\u2019s new executive order that bans \u201csecret or unlawful bureaucratic interpretations of rules and guards against unfair or unexpected penalties for non-compliance.\u201d\n\nBut even regulations that have gone through the formal rulemaking process haven\u2019t always met the Trump administration\u2019s own stated commitment to reducing red tape and business costs.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTake the new family planning \u201cgag rule,\u201d which prevents reproductive health clinics that receive federal funds from even referring patients to outside abortion services. Or another new Trump administration rule allowing health-care professionals to discriminate against LGBTQ patients in the name of \u201creligious freedom.\u201d In both these cases, the Trump administration didn\u2019t bother even trying to cook the books; by the administration\u2019s own economic cost-benefit analyses, both rules have high compliance costs for affected firms and zero quantified benefits.\n\nFor years, Republicans have claimed Democratic policies are about \u201cpicking winners and losers.\u201d The Trump administration\u2019s forte, it seems, is in solely picking the losers.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAD", "description": "Many of the changes are simply worse for the economy.", "authors": ["Catherine Rampell", "Columnist Covering Economics", "Public Policy", "Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/rQiMbnX1WMrRfFKm1qgN1A8q7W4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3XFQQPXWUYI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
