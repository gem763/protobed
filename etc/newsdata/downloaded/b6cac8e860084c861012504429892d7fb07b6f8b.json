Controversial celebrities, like porn stars, make particularly easy targets within a sex-obsessed culture that promotes shame in desire\u2019s stead, vilifying what it cannot possess or police. Some porn consumers feel particularly entitled to their hate, projecting their self-gratifying guilt and moral qualms onto a person they\u2019ve never met but will gleefully call a whore\u2014a dehumanizing tactic to solidify their moral righteousness and justify the death threats.\n\nTouted as one of the most-downloaded BBW stars, Sofia Rose embodies the concept of unfettered beauty, no longer handcuffed to societal pressures. As the reigning BBW XXX Performer of the Year, Rose continues to defy conventional stereotypes, collecting over a dozen awards in the last three years alone\u2014and that\u2019s after working in the adult industry for over a decade. As her popularity has increased, so have the death threats. \u201cI used to get them every so often, a handful of times a year, but now I\u2019m getting them on a weekly basis. They come on all platforms\u2014I get emails, text messages, I have a number published on an app for messages, and on Twitter and Instagram,\u201d says Rose.\n\n\u201cOne of the guys went so far as to say he got my personal information from public voting records,\u201d she continues. \u201cAnd there was a photo of a gun, which obviously could have been downloaded from the internet, but it was a photo of a gun laying on a bed and he said, \u2018I have your information.\u2019 Then he talked about another performer and said, \u2018just like I got hers\u2019 and he used her real name. It was a performer I know personally so I know her legal name.\u201d\n\nAt first, Rose did what most anyone with a substantial social-media following would do: she posted the threats on Instagram to show her over 657,000 followers what she was forced to deal with every week. However, the attention might have been exactly what these knuckle-draggers were looking for. \u201cI\u2019ve stopped posting about it publicly. I stopped giving them any kind of attention because I thought that was encouraging the behavior,\u201d says Rose. \u201cI don\u2019t acknowledge them at all and I don\u2019t say anything on social media about being scared. I don\u2019t want to give them any power.\u201d\n\nThe threats are escalating, according to Rose, growing significantly worse this year in direct correlation with her success as a top BBW performer. \u201cI get guys that say, \u2018How dare you block me,\u2019 and then just get into some graphic violence of what they\u2019re going to do to me,\u201d says Rose. \u201cI had one guy send me a message every day telling me I only had so many days to live. He was saying it like he knew I was going to be somewhere and he was going to blow up things. That one really scared me.\u201d\n\nBecause Rose is an adult performer, reporting the death threats may feel like an exercise in futility. They come in anonymously, and until it becomes physical the authorities aren\u2019t incentivized to dedicate resources. \u201cI take every threat seriously because I don\u2019t know. I save them, I don\u2019t delete them, so if something happens there\u2019s a record,\u201d says Rose. \u201cReporting it falls on deaf ears because I\u2019m a sex worker. It doesn\u2019t matter that I\u2019m someone\u2019s mom, someone\u2019s daughter, someone\u2019s wife.\u201d\n\n\u201c Reporting it falls on deaf ears because I\u2019m a sex worker. It doesn\u2019t matter that I\u2019m someone\u2019s mom, someone\u2019s daughter, someone\u2019s wife. \u201d\n\nThough the bulk of it is online, that hasn\u2019t stopped some from hunting her down in person. \u201cThe threats were very fresh. I\u2019d just gotten them days before this show in Chicago. This man had flown in from India and he would not leave the booth I was signing at. He was harassing me and following me around, he kept insisting that I take him in the back behind the curtain and give him a quick blowjob. He was being very aggressive to the point where when I had to leave, I got scared,\u201d recalls Rose, who at that point decided to get help from the event\u2019s security team. \u201cI let them know this guy was following me around and wouldn\u2019t even let me walk to the bathroom without following me. So I just stood there and wouldn\u2019t leave until they got Exxxotica\u2019s security to walk me out.\u201d\n\nAfter that nerve-racking experience, Rose decided to put her safety first and cut back on the public appearances: \u201cI\u2019m really uncomfortable going to events. I have my own bodyguard service that I hire now. They\u2019re very comforting but it never really eases your nerves because you\u2019re always looking over your shoulder, wondering if someone is following you. There\u2019s no way to know who\u2019s posing a threat.\u201d\n\nSofia Rose has maintained a steady career in the adult industry since 2006. She\u2019s a seasoned pro with years of experience to credibly differentiate between a normal and excessive amount of death threats; the latter has come with increased visibility and fame. Rose has her own theories as to why. \u201cWhen people ask me in general, why do you think you get death threats? I say, because I\u2019m confident and I\u2019m fat. And people feel entitled,\u201d says Rose. \u201cMen feel entitled to me because I\u2019m supposed to be grateful for any attention that I\u2019m getting. I joke about it that way, but I feel like there\u2019s a common theme. I block them on social media and they get angry about it and the common theme is rejection. They\u2019ve been rejected, and how dare a fat woman reject you. It always leads back to my thighs.\u201d\n\nThe deluge of \u201cfat whore\u201d and \u201cfat bitch\u201d comments aside, it\u2019s the anger that Rose finds most disconcerting. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d be targeted or that people would be so angry or triggered by me or my confidence,\u201d says Rose, who strives to promote body positivity.\n\n\u201cIt says a lot about our society and its decline in the last few years\u2014people have become more aggressive and race has become more of an issue,\u201d says Rose. \u201cIt\u2019s disheartening because I never thought people were that vile, or that angry, and that angry towards fat people! Or women of color, or people in the adult industry. I have all of those stigmatizing factors. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a combination. Maybe I\u2019m supposed to feel low about myself because of all three of those things, but it\u2019s the opposite. I\u2019m empowered by it.\u201d", "description": "BBW adult star Sofia Rose opens up to Aurora Snow about the large volume of death threats she receives\u2014and how they only seem to be increasing as her popularity grows.", "authors": ["Aurora Snow"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571447928/191018--snow-porn-harrassment-tease_ezsk8e", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
