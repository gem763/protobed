Instead, he told investigators that he was devoted to helping Ukraine resolve its grinding five-year-old conflict with Russian-armed separatists and tried to satisfy the president\u2019s suspicions about Ukraine but was never fully kept in the loop.\n\nNonetheless, his account, as related by a person familiar with his testimony and the documents released by the committee, raises significant questions for the president as well as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and others.\n\nMr. Volker told the House investigators that he was eager to help the newly elected Mr. Zelensky build a relationship with Mr. Trump that would bolster Ukraine but found last May that Mr. Giuliani\u2019s efforts were convincing the president that Ukraine was full of \u201cterrible people\u201d who \u201ctried to take me down\u201d in 2016.\n\nThe new Ukrainian government sought Mr. Volker\u2019s help in managing Mr. Giuliani. In July, Mr. Yermak asked Mr. Volker to connect him with the former New York mayor, which Mr. Volker agreed to do. Mr. Volker met with Mr. Giuliani for breakfast on July 19 and, he told the committee investigators, warned the former mayor that his theory about corruption involving Mr. Biden was unfounded and implausible and that his sources about it were not credible.\n\nThe Ukrainians were wary of being dragged into American domestic politics. \u201cPresident Zelenskyy is sensitive about Ukraine being taken seriously, not merely as an instrument in Washington domestic, reelection politics,\u201d William B. Taylor, the top American diplomat in Kiev, wrote in a text message a couple days after the breakfast.\n\nMr. Giuliani talked with Mr. Yermak the next day and then advocated a phone call between the two presidents. At the same time Mr. Trump had ordered his aides to hold up the $391 million in congressionally approved aid to Ukraine, with no explanation provided to the agencies involved. Then he got on the phone with Mr. Zelensky to ask for \u201ca favor.\u201d\n\nA week after the phone call, on Aug. 2, Mr. Giuliani met in Madrid with Mr. Yermak and then said the Ukrainian president should issue a statement committing to fighting corruption. A week later, Mr. Volker talked with Mr. Yermak and then reached out to Mr. Giuliani.", "description": "While President Trump has denied any quid pro quo in pushing Ukraine to investigate his foes, text messages indicate that his own team saw it otherwise.", "authors": ["Peter Baker"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/04/us/politics/04dc-prexy1/04dc-prexy1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
