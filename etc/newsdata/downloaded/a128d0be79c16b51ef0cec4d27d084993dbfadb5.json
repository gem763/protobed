The rand also declined sharply - almost reaching R14.90/$ last week, after starting May at R14.30. But by Monday morning, it was trading at R14.55\n\nRenewed trade tensions between the US and China \"sparked a sharp decline in nonresident capital flows to EM,\" IIF economists Jonathan Fortun and Greg Basile wrote.\n\nThe findings underscored not only ongoing trade tensions between the US and its trading partners, but the widespread volatility felt across global financial markets in recent months.\n\nThe IIF's report came on the heels of President Donald Trump's announcement on Thursday that he planned to impose tariffs of up to 25% on goods coming into the United States from Mexico until the \"illegal immigration problem is remedied.\"\n\nTrump's surprise announcement sent stocks reeling and the Mexican peso plunging.\n\nThe IIF economists noted the stark difference in equity and debt flows into emerging market during the month of May. While $14.6 billion (R212.9 billion) poured out of the former, $9 billion (R131 billion) flowed into the latter asset class.\n\nThe outflows from global stock markets were widespread during May, and not confined to one particular country, the IIF said.\n\n\"The reading for EM ex-China equity flows was -$7.4 bn (107.9 billion), while China equity flows were -$7.2 bn (105 billion), showing generalized outflows for equities across the whole EM complex,\" the economists said.\n\nReceive a single WhatsApp every morning with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "Investors pulled $14.6 billion out of emerging markets in May, the report found.
