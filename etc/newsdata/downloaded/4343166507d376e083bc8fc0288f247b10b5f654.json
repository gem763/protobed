This means that investors who purchase shares on or after the 9th of October will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 24th of October.\n\nNoni B's next dividend payment will be AU$0.06 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of AU$0.1 per share. Last year's total dividend payments show that Noni B has a trailing yield of 5.0% on the current share price of A$2.895. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing.\n\nView our latest analysis for Noni B\n\nIf a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Noni B distributed an unsustainably high 173% of its profit as dividends to shareholders last year. Without more sustainable payment behaviour, the dividend looks precarious. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. The company paid out 90% of its free cash flow over the last year, which we think is outside the ideal range for most businesses. Cash flows are usually much more volatile than earnings, so this could be a temporary effect - but we'd generally want look more closely here.\n\nAs Noni B's dividend was not well covered by either earnings or cash flow, we would be concerned that this dividend could be at risk over the long term.\n\nClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.\n\nASX:NBL Historical Dividend Yield, October 5th 2019 More\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nStocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. It's encouraging to see Noni B has grown its earnings rapidly, up 70% a year for the past five years. Noni B's dividend was not well covered by earnings, although at least its earnings per share are growing quickly. Generally, when a company is growing this quickly and paying out all of its earnings as dividends, it can suggest either that the company is borrowing heavily to fund its growth, or that earnings growth is likely to slow due to lack of reinvestment.\n\nMany investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Since the start of our data, ten years ago, Noni B has lifted its dividend by approximately 14% a year on average. It's exciting to see that both earnings and dividends per share have grown rapidly over the past few years.\n\nFinal Takeaway\n\nIs Noni B an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Earnings per share have been growing, despite the company paying out a concerningly high percentage of its earnings and cashflow. We struggle to see how a company paying out so much of its earnings and cash flow will be able to sustain its dividend in a downturn, or reinvest enough into its business to continue growing earnings without borrowing heavily. With the way things are shaping up from a dividend perspective, we'd be inclined to steer clear of Noni B.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see Noni B...", "authors": ["Simply Wall St"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Qxw7GjL_LTkEMobsACPiog--~B/aD00MzI7dz0xMTk0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/5ac545d110371f7c463ceb30568152e2", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
