Actor Eddie Murphy has plans on reprising his role as Axel Foley for \"Beverly Hills Cop 4,\" one of the signature performances of his long and storied career, according to a recent interview.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nMurphy, whose interpretation of Foley produced an iconic character of the movie industry in the 1980s, is currently working on another '80s sequel -- \u201cComing to America.\u201d That film was one of the top-grossing films of 1988 and is expected to come out next year.\n\nFoley was a Detroit police officer, dropped into posh Beverly Hills for a murder investigation. The movie, released in 1984, grossed over $234 million domestically. The smash-hit underscored Murphy\u2019s comedic appeal, as the movie outperformed classics released that year such as \u201cGhostbusters\u201d and \u201cIndiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,\u201d as well as \u201cThe Karate Kid.\u201d\n\nMurphy announced his plans to reprise the role on the eve of the release of \"Dolemite is my Name,\" a biopic of comedian, blaxploitation artist and musician Rudy Ray Moore. The film will be in select theaters Friday, and will be available on Netflix starting Oct. 25.\n\nMurphy remains a powerful box office draw, even as his production has slowed down in recent years. A new generation knows him as the voice of the \u201cShrek\u201d character, Donkey, but he has mostly worked on smaller projects over the past decade.\n\nHe told Collider.com that he\u2019ll begin filming the next \u201cBeverly Hills Cop\u201d installment soon. The comedian also confirmed that he will be hosting \"Saturday Night Live\" in what looks like a December appearance.\n\n\u201cYeah that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing after \u2018Coming to America 2.\u2019 We\u2019re doing 'Beverly Hills Cop' and then the plan is to get back on stage and do standup,\u201d Murphy told the site. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ll be doing mostly is standup. These movies and 'Saturday Night Live,' it\u2019s kind of like \u2026 I\u2019m looking at it as a bookend. If I decided I wanted to stay on the couch forever, I ended it on a funny note.\u201d\n\nWith films about nostalgia in-style, Murphy could again be a powerhouse at the box office.\n\nThree iterations of the Beverly Hills series all proved a success, but each with declining box office returns. The third and most recent movie was released in 1994.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Eddie Murphy is planning to begin filming soon on another installment of \"Beverly Hills Cop.\"", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/08/0/0/eddie-murphy-AP.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
