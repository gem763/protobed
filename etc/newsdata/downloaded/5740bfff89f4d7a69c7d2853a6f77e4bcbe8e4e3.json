Right after he threw a pass to receiver James Washington, Ravens linebacker Matt Judon hit Rudolph from behind, but safety Earl Thomas came from the front to sandwich the quarterback while striking him on the side of the cheek area with his helmet.\n\nRudolph instantly went down and his body appeared to go limp as his helmet slammed into the turf. Rudolph lay on the ground motionless while teammates immediately called for Pittsburgh\u2019s medical staff to come and tend to Rudolph.\n\nAfter a few minutes, Rudolph eventually appeared to regain consciousness and sat up. He eventually walked off the field very slowly, with assistance from teammates and medical staff.\n\nRudolph was later diagnosed with a concussion and ruled out for the remainder of the game. The team said he was taken to the hospital, and ESPN's Jeremy Fowler reported he returned home after further evaluation.\n\n\u201cI hit the strike zone like we talk about,\u201d Thomas said after the game, according to ESPN. \u201cI didn\u2019t go high. I didn\u2019t intentionally try to hurt him. I\u2019m worried about him. I heard he\u2019s at the hospital. My prayers go out to him and his family. I\u2019ve never tried to hurt anybody.\u201d\n\nUndrafted rookie Devlin Hodges out of Samford entered the game in Rudolph's place. He completed seven of nine passes for 68 yards and ran twice for 20 yards, but the Steelers fell to the Ravens 26-23 in overtime.\n\nRudolph took over as Pittsburgh's quarterback after Ben Roethlisberger suffered a season-ending elbow injury to his right arm during the team\u2019s second game. He completed 13 of 20 passes for 131 yards and a touchdown before exiting.\n\nFollow Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes.", "description": "Steelers QB Mason Rudolph needed teammates' assistance to leave the field after taking a helmet-to-helmet hit from Ravens S Earl Thomas.", "authors": ["Lorenzo Reyes", "Published P.M.
