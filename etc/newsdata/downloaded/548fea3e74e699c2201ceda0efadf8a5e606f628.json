Unusually, none of the parties were provided with advance copies of the judgment due to its sensitivity. Only seven of the 11 justices who heard the case were present in court.\n\n\n\nThe first legal question the judges had to resolve was whether the prime minister\u2019s decision \u2013 exploiting residual, royal prerogative powers \u2013 was \u201cjusticiable\u201d and could consequently be subjected to scrutiny by the courts. The English high court declined to intervene; the Scottish appeal court concluded that judges did have legal authority to act. The supreme court supported the Scottish interpretation.\n\nDelivering judgment, Hale said: \u201cThe question arises in circumstances which have never arisen before and are unlikely to arise again.\u201d\n\nThen, giving the court\u2019s judgment on whether the decision to suspend parliament was legal, Hale said: \u201cThis court has \u2026 concluded that the prime minister\u2019s advice to Her Majesty [ to suspend parliament] was unlawful, void and of no effect. This means that the order in council to which it led was also unlawful, void and of no effect should be quashed.\n\nQuick guide The six key paragraphs in the supreme court's verdict Show Hide That the court judgment was not about Brexit \u201cIt is important, once again, to emphasise that these cases are not about when and on what terms the United Kingdom is to leave the European Union. They are only about whether the advice given by the prime minister to Her Majesty the Queen on 27 or 28 August, that parliament should be prorogued from a date between 9 and 12 September until 14 October, was lawful and the legal consequences if it was not.\u201d That the court had the right to act \u201cThe first question is whether the lawfulness of the prime minister\u2019s advice to Her Majesty is justiciable. This court holds that it is. The courts have exercised a supervisory jurisdiction over the lawfulness of acts of the government for centuries.\u201c That the prorogation was not \u2018normal\u2019 \u201cIt prevented parliament from carrying out its constitutional role for five out of the possible eight weeks between the end of the summer recess and exit day on 31 October. Proroguing parliament is quite different from parliament going into recess. While parliament is prorogued, neither house can meet, debate or pass legislation. Neither house can debate government policy. Nor may members ask written or oral questions of ministers or meet and take evidence in committees\u2026This prolonged suspension of parliamentary democracy took place in quite exceptional circumstances: the fundamental change which was due to take place in the vonstitution of the United Kingdom on 31 October. Parliament, and in particular the House of Commons as the elected representatives of the people, has a right to a voice in how that change comes about. The effect upon the fundamentals of our democracy was extreme.\u201d That Boris Johnson\u2019s advice to the Queen was unlawful \u201cThe court is bound to conclude, therefore, that the decision to advise Her Majesty to prorogue parliament was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of parliament to carry out its constitutional functions without reasonable justification.\u201c That parliament has not been prorogued \u201cThis court has already concluded that the prime minister\u2019s advice to Her Majesty was unlawful, void and of no effect. This means that the order in council to which it led was also unlawful, void and of no effect and should be quashed. This means that when the royal commissioners walked into the House of Lords it was as if they walked in with a blank sheet of paper. The prorogation was also void and of no effect. Parliament has not been prorogued. This is the unanimous judgment of all 11 Justices.\u201d What happens next? \u201cIt is for parliament, and in particular the Speaker and the Lord Speaker, to decide what to do next. Unless there is some parliamentary rule of which we are unaware, they can take immediate steps to enable each house to meet as soon as possible. It is not clear to us that any step is needed from the prime minister, but if it is, the court is pleased that his counsel have told the court that he will take all necessary steps to comply with the terms of any declaration made by this court.\u201d The full judgment and the summary judgment can be downloaded from the Supreme court website.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis means that when the royal commissioners walked into the House of Lords [to prorogue parliament] it was as if they walked in with a blank sheet of paper.

It prevented parliament from carrying out its constitutional role for five out of a possible eight weeks between the end of the summer recess and exit day on 31 October.\n\n\n\n\u201cParliament might have decided to go into recess for the party conferences during some of that period but, given the extraordinary situation in which the United Kingdom finds itself, its members might have thought that parliamentary scrutiny of government activity in the run-up to exit day was more important and declined to do so, or at least they might have curtailed the normal conference season recess because of that.\n\n\u201cEven if they had agreed to go into recess for the usual three-week period, they would still have been able to perform their function of holding the government to account. Prorogation means that they cannot do that.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe court stopped short of declaring that the advice given by Johnson to the Queen was improper. It was a question. they said, they did not need to address since they had already found the effect of the prorogation was itself unlawful.\n\nDozens of remain supporters who had been waiting in the rain outside the supreme court since early morning erupted into cheers as news of the ruling filtered through .\n\n\n\nThe Scottish National party\u2019s Joanna Cherry, a barrister who was among those who challenged the prorogation in Edinburgh, was first out to give her reaction. \u201cThere is nothing to stop us, myself and my colleagues, immediately resuming the important job of scrutinising this Tory government, which has us hurtling towards Brexit,\u201d she said. \u201cBoris Johnson must have guts for once, and resign.\u201d\n\n\n\nGina Miller, who had taken the case to the supreme court, then emerged, flanked by lawyers and others.\u201cToday is not a win for any individual or court,\u201d she said, reading a prepared statement. \u201cIt\u2019s a win for parliamentary sovereignty.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe prime minister must open the doors of parliament tomorrow,\u201d she added.\n\n\n\nThere were jeers and booing from a handful of far right activists from the For Britain Party, who chanted \u201ctraitor\u201d as the SNP parliamentary leader, Ian Blackford, gave interviews nearby. \u201cWe love you Boris, we do,\u201d they sang.\n\nPlay Video 1:34 Boris Johnson: supreme court ruling has made getting Brexit deal harder \u2013 video\n\nSpeculation before the ruling was that the court would find against the prime minister; that they were unanimous came as a surprise.\n\nNeither of the two main lawyers who represented the government, Lord Keen QC and Sir James Eadie QC, were in court to hear the news of their crushing defeat.\n\nJames Libson, the solicitor at the law firm Mishcon de Reya, who represented Miller in this case, said:\u201cThis second success for our client Gina Miller in the supreme court is a testament to her resolve to take whatever steps are required to ensure executive overreach does not become a feature of our democracy. This case shows that our courts can be relied on to hold the executive to account when necessary and is evidence of the robustness of our system of separations of powers.\u201d\n\nElaine Motion, the senior solicitor with the Edinburgh law firm Balfour+Manson, who represented Cherry and the 75 other petitioners in the Scottish case, said the ruling upheld the \u201ccritical importance\u201d of the sovereignty of parliament.\n\nIn a statement, Motion said: \u201cIt is a huge vindication for the parliamentarians who led the way with the challenge in Scotland and an even more significant reinforcement of the critical importance of the rule of law and the sovereignty of parliament. Hopefully parliament can now get back to its essential work.\u201d\n\nLabour\u2019s Ian Murray, one of the MPs who brought the case in Scotland, described the result as \u201chistoric\u201d and an \u201castonishing rebuke to Boris Johnson for his disgraceful behaviour\u201d.\n\nThe wording of the judgment is unusually clear and forthright. While securing the absolute supremacy of parliament over the government or executive, it marks a significant moment in asserting for the judiciary an enhanced position within the UK\u2019s unwritten constitution. Some will see it as a further advance in the supreme court\u2019s development into a constitutional court.\n\n\n\nThe judgment declares: \u201cThis court is not \u2026 precluded by article 9 [of the bill of rights] or by any wider parliamentary privilege from considering the validity of the prorogation itself ... That advice [to the Queen] was outside the powers of the prime minister to give it. This means that it was null and of no effect.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 1:23 Boris Johnson should have the guts to resign, says SNP's Joanna Cherry \u2013 video\n\nGovernment lawyers had told the court, which sits in Westminster directly opposite parliament, that the justices should not enter into such a politically sensitive area, which was legally \u201cforbidden territory\u201d and constitutionally \u201can ill-defined minefield that the courts are not properly equipped to deal with\u201d.\n\nEirik Bjorge, professor of law at Bristol University, said: \u201cThe court has shown that in extreme circumstances it is not afraid of policing the executive even in the middle of what used to be referred to as forbidden territory for judges:high policy and the royal prerogative.\u201d\n\nDespite torrential rain, the first members of the public began queueing outside for seats in the supreme court at 5.20am on Tuesday eager to be present for the historic decision.", "description": "Judges rule on PM\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks at height of Brexit crisis", "authors": ["Owen Bowcott", "Severin Carrell", "Ben Quinn", "Martin Kettle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fef0b354329787fa35dcd04a920aef88092faa37/0_158_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a5c06e95d1cb7ca5d611f1162f4504bf", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
