You're absolutely huge',\" she told the police.\n\n\"I had already said we were not going to have sex. You end up getting to know someone over a cup of tea and I invited him in to be sociable. I thought he was going to have a cup of tea and chat.\"\n\n(Image: Ric Mellis/Hyde News & Pictures Ltd)\n\nPrior to Schubert's arrival, the woman told the police, they had discussed sleeping in the same bed if he came over to her house but she had said nothing would happen and she would wear her pyjamas.\n\nThe woman added: \"Given his size, we would not have fitted comfortably in the same bed. There is personal space and there is personal space. Even if I had a king size bed...I'd have no personal space at all. I'd have nowhere to go.\n\n\"There had already been a conversation. He had invited me over to his and he had a king size bed. I said to him that if I felt comfortable I'd sleep in a king size bed, but I'd have my personal space.\n\n\"When he arrived and I saw his size I just thought: 'There is absolutely no way. I said I did not know he was as big as what he was. Literally'. It doesn't stop me liking someone because of his size but it was never my intention to sleep with him.\"\n\n(Image: PA Archive/Press Association Images)\n\nSchubert, from St Neots, Cambridgeshire, had chatted up the complainant through Match.com messages where he told her about how he earned a living selling \"designer clothes, shoes, anything I can get my hands on\" over online auctioneering marketplace, eBay.\n\nShe told officers he was \"morbidly obese\" in appearance and that he was so large his tee-shirt didn't cover his stomach.\n\nThe defendant, on trial accused of two counts of rape and two counts of sexual assault by penetration, sat wearing a dark coloured blazer and tee-shirt as he listened to the chat history between him and the complainant being read out before the jury and Judge Nigel Daly.\n\nThe trial continues.", "description": "Christopher Schubert, described as a \"big, cuddly bear\", met the woman on dating site Match.com and then visited her home in Oxfordshire", "authors": ["Charlie Moloney", "Bradley Jolly", "Image", "Ric Mellis Hyde News", "Pictures Ltd", "Pa Archive Press Association Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20537746.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Woman-said-dating-site-rape-accused-fatter-than-his-pictures.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
