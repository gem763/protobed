Checking and balancing these three separate, yet intertwined, branches of the federal government became the Framers\u2019 key goal. Devotees of Newtonian physics, they searched for a governing system whose movements and gravitational pulls would function like \u201ca machine that would go of itself.\u201d\n\nYet they had only recently broken the bonds of arbitrary monarchical rule in the bloody Revolutionary War, so they had to find ways of mitigating the possibility that \u201cenlightened statesmen may not always be at the helm,\u201d as Madison expressed his fear. In his blueprint for the Philadelphia Convention, he proposed that the executive could be removed and disqualified from holding future office after impeachment and conviction for \u201cmalpractice or neglect of duty.\u201d Madison borrowed from the British parliamentary practice of removing the monarch\u2019s ministers for subverting the state or violating the rule of law.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnother Virginian, George Mason, argued for \u201csome mode of displacing\u201d the executive, without reducing him to a \u201cmere creature of the legislature.\u201d He worried that a president might gain office by corrupt means \u2014 bribing the Electoral College, for example. \u201cShall a man who has practiced corruption, and by that means procured his appointment in the first instance, \u2026 escape punishment by repeating his guilt?\u201d\n\nMadison agreed. Waiting to turn a corrupt president out of office by defeating him at the ballot box was insufficient. Like all of the Founders, who worried about improper influence from outside the nascent country, Madison warned that the president might even \u201cbetray his trust to foreign powers.\u201d\n\nAs the Philadelphia Convention drew to a close, delegates substituted \u201ctreason and bribery\u201d for Madison\u2019s initial impeachment criteria. Mason wanted to add \u201cmaladministration,\u201d but his Virginia compatriot worried that such imprecision would make the president a tool of the Senate, which the Constitution had selected to try impeachment cases after indictment by the House of Representatives. Mason suggested \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors against the State\u201d as a substitute. The Constitution\u2019s final version eliminated the last three words, prompting debates to this day on how to define what constitutes high crimes and misdemeanors.\n\nMason still worried that the impeachment clause was insufficient to prevent presidential exposure to foreign influence. Virginia Gov. Edmund Randolph tried, unsuccessfully, to convince him that if a president accepted payments from a another country, he would be in violation of the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause \u2014 an impeachable high crime.\n\nWhy did the Founders choose the Senate, instead of the Supreme Court, as the forum for impeachment trials? Alexander Hamilton asserted that the nation\u2019s highest court would be too small (only six justices initially) to undertake such a momentous responsibility. The Framers\u2019 selection of the chief justice to preside over presidential impeachments achieved, Hamilton believed, \u201cthe prudent mean\u201d of combining the highest-ranking judge in the federal judiciary with the upper house of the national legislature.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWhere else than in the Senate could have been found a tribunal sufficiently dignified, or sufficiently independent?\u201d Hamilton asked rhetorically. What a quaintly anachronistic argument, reflecting that in the original Constitution, and until 1913, U.S. senators were not directly elected by voters, mistrusted by the Founders, but chosen by state legislatures.\n\nComposer Lin-Manuel Miranda should wax lyrical on Hamilton\u2019s still-relevant observation that impeachments \u201cproceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust.\u201d They are \u201cPOLITICAL,\u201d he emphasized. Because impeachable offenses injure \u201csociety itself \u2026 the prosecution of them will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole community, and to divide it into parties more or less friendly or inimical to the accused.\u201d\n\nHamilton predicted with acute foresight that in impeachments these factions \u201cwill enlist all their animosities, partialities, influence and interest on one side or on the other; and in such cases there will always be the greatest danger that the decision will be regulated more by the comparative strength of parties, than by the real demonstrations of innocence or guilt.\u201d\n\nAnd back to Madison\u2019s reality check and balance: \u201cWhat is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature? \u2026 In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: A dependence on the people is, no doubt, the primary control on the government; but experience has taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions.\u201d\n\nSoon we will learn if the impeachment \u201cprecaution\u201d can operate as Madison and Hamilton hoped.\n\nBarbara A.
