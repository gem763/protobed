And this is the first of 11 formally presented courses for just 16 diners at the kitchen bar.\n\n\u201cFor me, zensai is a showcase of all the techniques used in preparing for kaiseki, as well as of the season\u2019s finest produce,\u201d says Miyazawa.\n\nHe studied kaiseki in Japan and Singapore for 20 years before moving to Ishizuka in 2018 and winning two Good Food Guide hats for the restaurant.\n\nMiyazawa hopes his guests leave having gained a small understanding of the philosophy and technique behind the food they have eaten.\n\n\u201cI love the kaiseki way of thinking, and the precision it requires,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think any other cuisine has the same level of philosophy and craft.\u201d\n\nNot showing off, then, but proudly preserving his culture\u2019s greatest gastronomic tradition.", "description": "Kaiseki, the pinnacle of Japanese dining, is not just food \u2013 it's a way of thinking.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.9375%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_173%2C$y_760/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1e4f2246bd0a073e587754c2e637507c51ba118d", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
