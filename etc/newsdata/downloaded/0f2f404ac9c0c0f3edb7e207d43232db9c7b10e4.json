News and TMZ. They previously had a 50-50 custody arrangement.\n\nView photos Britney Spears with sons Sean Preston and Jayden James Federline in August.

However, it just became \u201cofficial and formalized\u201d on Aug. 28, because they reportedly wanted to test it out and see how it went before making it official.\n\nThis news comes at the same time as a report from The Blast, which says Federline filed a police report against Spears\u2019s father, Jamie Spears, on Aug. 25, alleging battery on his minor son, Sean Preston. The incident reportedly took place while Spears had custody of the boy. The website states that Spears got both sons away from her father \u2014 and Federline was called to pick them up.\n\nThe case is currently with the Ventura County District Attorney's Office for charging consideration, The Blast reports.\n\nView photos Kevin Federline, celebrating his 40th birthday at Crazy Horse III Gentlemen's Club in 2018, has a new custody agreement with ex Britney Spears.

She\u2019s been candid about battling anxiety and had a very public mental breakdown in 2007 when she initially separated from Federline and, for a time, lost custody of their children altogether. Spears has a conservatorship in place with her father in charge.\n\nSpears, who hasn\u2019t spoken publicly about losing time with her boys, loves sharing their adventures on social media. In early August, the trio visited Disneyland.\n\nThey often go to Hawaii with the performer and take other fun trips.\n\nTheir posh lifestyle with their famous mom factored into Federline seeking the court\u2019s help in renegotiating their custody agreement last year. K-Fed sought increased child support payments because Spears was making more money and he was making less than when they first came to terms in 2007.\n\nIn court documents, Federline\u2019s legal team noted that when the children were with Spears, they had private chefs and tutors as well as \"toys\" including ATVs, video game systems, iPads and laptops. It also noted that Spears takes them on multiple vacations a year at luxury resorts. However, Federline \u2014 who was receiving about $20,000 a month in child support \u2014 couldn\u2019t afford to take them on vacation. He said he didn\u2019t have space in his house for his sons to have sleepovers.", "description": "Britney Spears\u2019s new custody agreement scales back the amount of time she gets with her two sons \u2014 and that\u2019s just part of the Spears family drama.", "authors": ["Suzy Byrne", "Editor", "Yahoo Entertainment"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/tUF0qFUINrlO.gfYcgiTXg--~B/aD04NDg7dz0xMTU0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/fdb5ab90-ce83-11e9-95ff-c2a074fa40a3"}
