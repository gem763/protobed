However, Brown becoming a free agent again doesn\u2019t mean the NFL\u2019s investigation into his other sexual misconduct allegations are going away anytime soon.\n\nInvestigation into sexual assault allegations against Antonio Brown continues\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nShortly after Brown\u2019s release, the NFL announced that its investigation into sexual assault and rape allegations against the free agent is still ongoing. The allegations stem from the lawsuit filed last week by his former trainer Britney Taylor.\n\nAdditionally, the NFL said it could also sideline Brown if he signs with a new team before the end of its investigation by placing him on the commissioner\u2019s exempt list.\n\nStatement of Antonio Brown\u2019s status from the NFL: pic.twitter.com/veWL9TwLD6 \u2014 Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) September 21, 2019\n\nPlayers on the commissioner\u2019s exempt list can still be paid, but are prohibited from playing in a game or practicing with their team. You can imagine how that kind of potential situation might discourage what few teams are still interested in Brown from signing him.\n\nAs ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter reports, Brown\u2019s career has been effectively put on pause as both the NFL\u2019s investigation and proceedings for Taylor\u2019s lawsuit continue.\n\nStory continues\n\nNFL now can conduct its investigation of Antonio Brown without any time pressure. It's hard to imagine another team would attempt to get in the way of that. So Brown's NFL career is on pause and possibly could even be over. \u2014 Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) September 20, 2019\n\nThe NFL recently took a major step in its investigation against Brown by interviewing Taylor, who accused Brown of forcibly raping her in 2018. She also accused him of exposing himself to her and kissing her without her consent, then later masturbating onto her back while she watched a church service on her iPad in 2017.\n\nIt could be a while before Antonio Brown finds his fourth team of the last year.

The NFL also declined to place him on the commissioner\u2019s exempt list at that point, allowing him to play in Week 2.\n\nBrown\u2019s reported attempt to contact another woman who accused him of advancing on her while wearing nothing but a towel and texting photos of her children to his associates eventually proved to be the final straw for the Patriots.\n\nDespite all of those pending matters, Brown\u2019s agent Drew Rosenhaus still clarified on Twitter that Brown hopes to play with another team soon.\n\nIt's unfortunate things didn't work out with the Patriots. But Antonio is healthy and is looking forward to his next opportunity in the NFL. He wants to play the game he loves and he hopes to play for another team soon. \u2014 Drew Rosenhaus (@RosenhausSports) September 20, 2019\n\nWe\u2019ll see if any team is interested in a player that is facing a sexual assault lawsuit and suspension, has incinerated every bridge in sight over the last year and would possibly be prohibited from playing but still get paid if brought on board.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Antonio Brown is a free agent against after his release from the Patriots.
