Only customers with Full Self-Driving Capability or Enhanced Autopilot will get access to the Smart Summon feature.\n\nThe version 10 upgrade also allows Model S, Model X, and Model 3 cars to connect to a driver's Netflix, YouTube, and Hulu accounts so that they can watch videos, while parked, on the vehicles' iPad-like displays. The feature is expected to come in handy when customers wait and charge their vehicles.\n\nChina-based Tesla owners will soon be able to do the same with iQiyi and Tencent video.\n\nTesla is also rolling out a \"Car-aoke\" feature, widely requested by customers, which includes a library of music and song lyrics that passengers and drivers can use while parked or driving.\n\nAccording to a study by DMEAutomotive, singing out loud is the top non-driving activity that people do in the car, and more than half of drivers do it when they're behind the wheel.\n\nCEO Elon Musk promoted the update earlier in the day.\n\nWATCH: Elon Musk and Jack Ma debate whether humans are smarter than computers", "description": "Tesla Smart Summon, in the new Version 10 software update, will let customers who have the Full Self-Driving Capability or Enhanced Autopilot summon their cars as long as they're within line of sight.", "authors": ["Lora Kolodny"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105773926-1551733568737model-3---red-driving-sunset.jpg?v=1551733606", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
