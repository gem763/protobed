It\u2019s a good lesson for me, hopefully it\u2019s a good lesson for other people as well,\u201d Marsh told reporters.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day it\u2019s a game of cricket. Sometimes you get beaten, you get out, and you can\u2019t be punching walls. As a captain, I\u2019ve done a lot of work in setting a good example on and off the field over the last 18 months since I took over. This is a small hiccup for me.\u201d\n\nMarsh was recalled to Australia\u2019s test side for the final Ashes match against England last month and national coach Justin Langer has been in touch with him.\n\n\u201cHe just told me I\u2019m an idiot basically. He was disappointed for me,\u201d said Marsh, the son of former Australia opener Geoff Marsh.\n\n\u201cJust the feeling of letting your team mates down and not being able to be a part of the journey for the next four to six weeks, that was the point I wanted to stress to the lads, that I was sorry.\u201d", "description": "Australia all-rounder Mitchell Marsh broke his hand punching a dressing-room wall in frustration during a Sheffield Shield match and could be out of action for six weeks.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
