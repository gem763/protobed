Germany indicated its support for Tusk's proposal.\n\nDiplomats are scheduled to meet again on Friday, and Tusk was planning to continue his consultations with the 27 heads of state and government.\n\n\u201cThe French have not specified any date,\u201d an EU diplomat said. \u201cThey told the Coreper meeting [of EU ambassadors] that they were not opposed to a technical extension that is limited in time to allow the British parliament to finalize its ratification process.\u201d\n\nTusk, so far, has sought to characterize the extension as a technical matter, though EU officials recognize any delay could create space for major political developments in Britain.\n\n\"The meeting was not meant to take any formal decisions and it didn't,\" a senior EU official said. \"All agreed on the need for an extension to avoid a no-deal Brexit. The duration of an extension is still being discussed. There was a strong preference to use a written procedure to take the final decision.\"\n\nDiplomats are scheduled to meet again on Friday, and Tusk was planning to continue his consultations with the 27 heads of state and government.\n\n\u201cWe cannot decide for them,\u201d one diplomat said after the meeting.\n\nSeveral diplomats said they recognize and agree with the logic of Tusk's proposal to grant the extension request as submitted by Johnson on Saturday in accordance with a U.K. law known as the Benn Act.\n\nThat extension would create space for the U.K. to potentially hold a national election in December, or for Johnson to muster sufficient support in the U.K. parliament to win ratification. EU officials and diplomats said they are eager to avoid Brussels getting pulled into Britain's internal political dispute or being accused of taking sides for or against Johnson or anyone else.\n\nDiplomats said there was also some tension over the speed with which Tusk publicly recommended granting a delay, shortly after the U.K. parliament voted against Johnson's legislative timetable for ratifying the bill on Tuesday.\n\nSome EU countries chafed at what they viewed as an effort by Tusk to avoid debate or discussion about the extension. But the diplomats said the objections were a matter of principle regarding the EU's own internal functioning and not because leaders disagree with Tusk about the need for an extension, or because they prefer to hold another leaders' summit. (They don't.)\n\nA diplomat said that ambassadors were unanimous \"that an extension will be needed to overcome the deadlock in London and that decision should preferably be taken by written procedure.\"\n\nSome EU leaders, notably French President Emmanuel Macron, have long said that they would only agree to an extension if there was a good reason, such as to allow a general election in the U.K. But confronted with the near certainty of Britain crashing out without a deal on November 1, those countries seem to be backing away from any ultimatum.\n\nA second diplomat said EU leaders could not predict how an extension of the deadline would be used in London \u2014 whether it would simply give Johnson time to advocate leaving without a deal, or if it would allow his opponents in the Labour Party to simply continue delaying while refusing to allow a national election.\n\nA third diplomat said that ambassadors agreed on the general \"expectation that the U.K. will inform the EU about its next steps\" \u2014 though such updates have not been particularly useful in recent days.\n\nThe same diplomat said that ambassadors were unanimous \"that an extension will be needed to overcome the deadlock in London and that decision should preferably be taken by written procedure.\"\n\n\"Mood in the room points to a longer extension,\" the third diplomat added, signaling January 31 as the likely date.\n\nBut others cautioned that the discussion is far from complete.\n\nIn any event, it seems that British MPs eager for a decision in Brussels could spend their time further scrutinizing the roughly 600-page Withdrawal Agreement.\n\nMa\u00efa de La Baume contributed reporting.", "description": "With Westminster still stuck, EU countries move toward delaying the October 31 deadline for the UK\u2019s departure.", "authors": ["David M.
