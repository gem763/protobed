Here's what happened", "language": "en", "text": "CHICAGO \u2013 Students flocked to camps, friends' houses, safe havens and bowling alleys on Thursday as about 32,000 Chicago Public Schools teachers and aides went on strike in the nation's third-largest school district.\n\nWhile parents scrambled to find places for their children, attitudes toward the strike \u2014 at least those expressed publicly \u2014 remained split. Many said they wanted teachers to be paid well and wanted the schools to have more support staff in the form of nurses and school psychologists, a key demand of the union.\n\nBut people also said they respected that Mayor Lori Lightfoot has a responsibility toward taxpayers. Community leaders said they respected CPS CEO Janice Jackson, who was previously a principal in some of Chicago's toughest neighborhoods.\n\n\"We understand both sides,\" said Wilonda Cannon, a senior director at Breakthrough, a community center in the East Garfield Park neighborhood that provided daytime educational activities for about 20 kids Thursday. \"We just want them to come to an agreement soon.\"\n\nNegotiations continued Thursday morning and afternoon between city and union leaders, but no deal was reached. Teachers are expected to be back on the picket lines at 6:30 a.m. Friday.\n\nAfter rejecting the Chicago Teachers Union\u2019s demands, which led to the strike call, Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced classes for about 360,000 students would be canceled until the walkout ends.\n\nCPS strike: What else you need to know\n\nOn Day One of the strike, public workers and kids rose before the sun to picket outside their schools, chanting, holding posters and cheering at buses and cars that honked as they drove by. They donned hats, gloves and scarves for the 44-degree morning and warmed up with doughnuts and coffee.\n\nOutside Chalmers Elementary on the city\u2019s West Side, some held signs saying: \"Speed limit 30, not a class size for young children\" and \"Dumbledore wouldn\u2019t let this happen.\"\n\nMaggie Sermont, 32, a CTU school delegate and middle school special education teacher, has taught for seven years at Chalmers, which serves mainly low-income students and students who are experiencing homelessness.\n\n\"This is a difficult neighborhood to work in,\" she said. \"We have a lot of churn and burn and teachers going out the door. No one is working at Chalmers Elementary school for the pay. We really want to help the kids, and we need wraparound services, clinicians, specials teachers.\"\n\nIn the afternoon, educators across the city converged downtown for a mass demonstration near the Board of Education headquarters. Thousands of teachers clad in red and support staff in purple continued their chants, including, \u201cLori Lightfoot, get on the right foot!\u201d and \"Get up! Get down! Chicago is a union town!\" They banged buckets, clanged bells and shook tambourines as they marched through downtown.\n\nKaleb Autman, a supporter of the strike, leads teachers and SEIU supporters at Breakthrough, a non-profit for those affected by poverty. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot later read a book to children at the center. More\n\nBuildings remained open\n\nPer orders from CPS, buildings remained open on a normal bell schedule for children to attend \u2013 staffed by administrators and other non-union employees. Meals were served. But only about 6,700 children attended CPS schools Thursday, according to an official estimate that afternoon. That's less than 2% of the approximate 360,000 children enrolled in the district.\n\nShani Blackwell, a CPS mother, said disruptions in the school week are particularly challenging for her 8-year-old son. They live in the Austin neighborhood on the city's West Side.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in the weird space of like \u2013 I support the teachers, but it\u2019s a hardship for me,\" Blackwell said. \"My son is a special education student, so while the district offered to keep the schools open, there won\u2019t be the personnel there that he needs.\"", "description": "Chicago Public Schools teachers went on strike Thursday morning, seeking smaller class sizes, more support staff and a pay raise.", "authors": ["Grace Hauck", "Erin Richards", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ZAra2Wd4D_qENcM6DrWULQ--~B/aD0yMjM0O3c9MzM1MTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/1bb732a41305dc042e4d14a69b8d87b2", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
