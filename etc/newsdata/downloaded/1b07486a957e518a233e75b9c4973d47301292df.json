Not every Democrat wants to get their feet wet, however. Roll Call reports that a number of House Democrats want to wait on starting impeachment proceedings, some for electoral issues and others unconvinced that Ukraine-Gate warrants such a move in the first place:\n\nA cascade of Democrats facing competitive races backed an impeachment inquiry this week, which likely spurred Speaker Nancy Pelosi to drop her objections to using that word to describe ongoing probes. Some vulnerable incumbents are not using the \u201cI\u201d word, however, and the Republican-leaning districts they represent help explain why. These lawmakers are not defending President Donald Trump. But they want more information about allegations that he pressured the newly elected Ukrainian president to investigate a potential 2020 opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden. They particularly want to read the full complaint from a whistleblower who raised concerns about the president\u2019s actions. Some also say an inquiry should be bipartisan, while one has questioned whether Trump\u2019s actions rise to the level of impeachment. Of the 44 Democrats named to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee\u2019s Frontline program for vulnerable incumbents, 10 had not backed a formal impeachment inquiry at press time.\n\nI\u2019m surprised it\u2019s only ten. The electoral risks attendant to impeachment are enormous, as I point out in my column at The Week. Pelosi\u2019s freshman class might just be sacrificial lambs for a doomed project:\n\nMore critically, Democrats have been selling impeachment for months \u2014 and the American public isn\u2019t buying it, even with the shifting rationales Democrats have made in arguing for it. A new Politico-Morning Consult survey started after the Ukraine allegations first emerged last week shows that support for impeachment hasn\u2019t budged since the release of the Mueller report, ticking down a point from the previous week to 36 percent. More than half of respondents had heard \u201csome\u201d or \u201ca lot\u201d about the Ukraine whistleblower complaint, but it didn\u2019t impact the results at all. Worse yet, impeachment isn\u2019t selling where Democrats made their best gains in the midterms. A majority of suburban respondents oppose starting the impeachment process (35 percent/50 percent), with a wider gap among rural respondents (27/59), while urban voters are more ambivalent than one might guess (47/35). Impeachment trails by double digits in the South (33/53), Midwest, (36/48), and even in the Democrat-friendly Northeast (37/48). Without a smoking gun more convincing than the Zelensky call, Democrats have no hope of moving those numbers, which have remained fairly constant since early this year. CNN reported this morning that some in Pelosi\u2019s caucus had already started warning about what would happen when the transcript turned out to be less than advertised by impeachment advocates, and that moderates had tried to insist that Pelosi wait for an explicit quid pro quo before taking the leap. That would have been good advice, as it turns out. Pelosi\u2019s now stuck with delivering impeachment regardless of public sentiment about it, and then preparing for the backlash in the suburbs, Midwest, and South if she succeeds. Alea iacta est, indeed.\n\nThe problem here is that impeachment isn\u2019t going to work. Democrats have been pitching it for months to no effect. Even if they do enough of their own caucus to impeach Trump, it\u2019s going to look bitterly partisan rather than a reasonable course of action. Republicans are not going to cooperate, especially not in the Senate by removing Trump on the basis of a party-line impeachment on questionable grounds. All of that means Democrats will have sacrificed their suburban frosh class for nothing at all but appeasing their progressive base.\n\nThe smart play would be censure, not impeachment, but it\u2019s too late for that now as well. Declaring \u201calea iacta est\u201d means Pelosi\u2019s on the hook to deliver an impeachment now. Whether these Democrats want to get their feet wet in that Rubicon is immaterial \u2014 they\u2019ll drown in it no matter what.", "description": "Alea iacta est!", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
