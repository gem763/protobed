However, smartphone sales have declined over the past few quarters due to market saturation.\n\nThe Chinese government, which in June handed out 5G licenses to the three major telecom operators, has pushed for the fast map-out of 5G network across the country as it views the next-generation network as one of the core components for showing its technological strength, particularly at the time when it is embroiled in a trade war with the United States.\n\nWhile China Unicom and China Telecom have promised to invest about 8 billion yuan ($1.1 billion) and 9 billion yuan on 5G network construction this year, China Mobile announced in August that its budget for 5G network investment had been raised nearly 50% to 24 billion yuan for 2019.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\nChina issues 5G licenses to local telcos, TV network\n\nChinese government awards commercial 5G licenses to the country's three biggest telcos--China Mobile, China Telecom, and China Unicom--as well as state-owned China Broadcasting Network, just as Huawei announces it will be deploying 5G technology in Russia, with tests to start this year.\n\nChina to lead APAC tech spend, 5G race ahead of global markets\n\nChina will remain Asia's largest in terms of tech spending, growing 4 percent this year and 6 percent in 2020, and lead global markets in the 5G race where its investments in telecommunications account for 57 percent of the country's overall spend.\n\nHuawei tests 5G downloads in China as government due to issue licenses\n\nHuawei is also scheduled to ship its foldable 5G smartphone, the Mate X, this month.\n\nEricsson: 5G can boost enterprise revenue, but security controversy slowing down industry\n\nTouting its low latency and high speeds, Ericsson says 5G can introduce a multitude of new applications for businesses and give telcos the cost efficiencies they seek, but the persistent controversy over cybersecurity--specifically involving Huawei--is leading to uncertainty and a general slowdown in the market.\n\nBT first foreign telecom company to secure China licenses\n\nThe UK telco has secured nationwide licences in China that will enable it to directly contract and bill Chinese customers, marking the first time a foreign telecommunications company has been allowed to do so across the country.\n\nWhy China will surpass the world in 5G deployment speed (TechRepublic)\n\nWhat Mobile Experts coined as the 'China Surge' will lead to massive 5G deployments through 2021.", "description": "China Unicom has struck a deal with its rival China Telecom to build their 5G networks together to cut costs.", "authors": ["Cyrus Lee"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/12/21/862a11fe-0420-4242-a77a-bc02635bc6a8/thumbnail/770x578/fac95f30b2ded2f7bca686e4a1c159a4/istock-546436570.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
