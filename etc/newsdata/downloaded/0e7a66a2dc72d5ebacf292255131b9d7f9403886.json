We know that the manufacturing sector globally is being impacted by what\u2019s happening with trade, so we would expect that exports and manufacturing would be weak and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve seen,\u201d Rosengren said, in an interview on CNBC.\n\nEquity markets sold off sharply this weak after data from the Institute for Supply Management for September showed the weakest reading for manufacturing activity in about a decade, with a report from ISM on nonmanufacturing coming in at a three-year low.\n\nRead: U.S. manufacturers experience worst month since Great Recession\n\nThe Boston Fed chief said the data are still consistent with the economy slowing only modestly, to around a 1.7% annual rate over the second half of the year.\n\nIt would be more concerning of the economy slowed much more than that, he added.\n\nThe September job report was consistent with an economy that could grow at a steady pace, Rosengren said. The big question remained whether it would weaken from here.\n\nOther issues still up in the air are whether the factory weakness spills over to areas not directly affected by trade concerns and whether consumers remain confident to keep spending, he said.\n\nRosengren voted against the two Fed rate cuts this year. He has said he\u2019s worried that pushing the economy with rate cuts would lead to different \u201cpockets\u201d of financial instability.\n\nAfter weak ISM factory and service-sector reports, investors now see an 80% chance of a rate cut at the meeting on Oct. 29-30, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\n\nRosengren said he was open-minded about what he would advocate at the meeting. He said he would be focusing on data about consumers, he said.\n\nStrong auto sales in September seemed to belie concerns about the consumer, he noted.\n\nRosengren said Fed interest-rate policy are below neutral and would foster growth in coming months.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already had two easings. Easings don\u2019t have their impact immediately,\u201d he said.\n\nStocks jumped after the jobs report was released, as investors breathed a sign of relief the data wasn\u2019t as bad as many had feared but wasn\u2019t strong enough, perhaps, to dissuade the Fed from cutting rates at the end of this month.
