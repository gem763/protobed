(AP) - Phillip Lindsay ran for 114 yards, Denver\u2019s defense forced three turnovers and the Broncos got their first win under Vic Fangio by defeating the Los Angeles Chargers 20-13 on Sunday.\n\nJoe Flacco completed 14 of 20 passes for 162 yards and a touchdown as Denver (1-4) raced to a 17-0 lead in the second quarter and held on for the 500th victory in franchise history.\n\nLos Angeles (2-3) struggled most of the day and had two turnovers inside the Denver 5. The Chargers got within 17-10 midway through the fourth quarter, but Denver\u2019s Brandon McManus put it out of reach with a 46-yard field goal with 1:55 remaining.\n\nChase McLaughlin\u2019s 32-yard field goal brought LA back within a touchdown with 15 seconds remaining, but Denver recovered the onside kick to put it away.\n\nPhilip Rivers was 32 of 48 for 211 yards with two interceptions. Melvin Gordon was held to 31 yards rushing in his first game back after a holdout. Fellow running back Austin Ekeler had 15 receptions for 86 yards.\n\nThe Broncos dominated from the start and scored touchdowns on their first two drives for the first time in 17 games. Lindsay\u2019s 4-yard run up the middle marked the first time Denver scored on its opening drive this season. The Broncos didn\u2019t have a play over 20 yards on the first drive over the first four games. But Flacco had a 26-yard strike to tight end Jeff Heuerman and Lindsay had a 21-yard gain off left guard to put the Broncos deep in Chargers territory two plays into the game.\n\nAfter a Chargers punt, Denver took a two-TD lead when Courtland Sutton went 70 yards up the left sideline. Sutton caught the ball at the Chargers 45, slipped out of an attempted tackle by Rayshawn Jenkins and then eluded a diving Roderic Teemer for this third touchdown in the past two games.\n\nMcManus added a 40-yard field goal to give Denver a 17-0 halftime lead.\n\nLos Angeles had two chances to score in the first half, but came up empty both times. New kicker McLaughlin\u2019s 48-yard field goal was partially blocked midway through the second quarter. Ekeler then was stopped at the Broncos 1 by Kareem Jackson and fumbled as he tried to reach the goal line. It is the first time since 2012 the Chargers have been shut out in the first half at home.\n\nThe Chargers\u2019 red zone woes continued in the third quarter. Kyzir White\u2019s interception of Flacco gave them the ball at the Denver 7, but Rivers tried to throw it into double coverage and was picked off by Alexander Johnson in the end zone on third-and-goal from the 2.\n\nThe Chargers finally get on the board with 31 seconds remaining in the third quarter when Desmond King returned a punt 68 yards. It is the second punt return TD in his career, the eighth player in franchise history with multiple scores.\n\nLos Angeles closed to 17-10 on McLaughlin\u2019s 45-yard field goal with 6:52 remaining.\n\nSLOW RETURN\n\nGordon had 38 scrimmage yards in his first game back after a 64-day holdout due to a contract dispute. The Chargers got him involved quickly with a 4-yard screen pass on their first play. Gordon reported back on Sept. 26 and was activated prior to last week\u2019s game at Miami but did not play.\n\nThe Chargers came into the game averaging 103.5 rushing yards but were held to 35. The Broncos allowed 225 yards to Jacksonville\u2019s Leonard Fournette a week ago and had the third-worst run defense.\n\nINJURIES\n\nBroncos: CB De\u2019Vante Bausby was strapped to a backboard and taken off the field on a cart during the second quarter. He was injured when he collided with Johnson while making a tackle on Ekeler. Bausby was taken to a local hospital and was reported to have movement in his arms and legs. \u2026 LB Justin Hollins suffered a knee injury during the second half.\n\nChargers; C Mike Pouncey suffered a neck injury during the first half and did not return.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBroncos: return home to face Tennessee next Sunday.\n\nChargers: host Pittsburgh next Sunday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Phillip Lindsay ran for 114 yards, Denver's defense forced three turnovers and the Broncos got their first win under Vic Fangio by defeating the Los Angeles Chargers 20-13 on Sunday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joe Reedy"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/06/aptopix_broncos_chargers_football_04528_c0-137-3280-2049_s1770x1032.jpg?8d8b3abdc71affaac657bc28d1a2e8492c999b50", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
