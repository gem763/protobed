(Zach Gibson/Getty Images)\n\nColumnist\n\nThe Trump administration recently revealed its grand plan for turbocharging economic growth: Make Drinking Water Dirty Again.\n\nThe talking heads who get trotted out to defend President Trump frequently tout his supposedly stellar economic record. He\u2019s unleashing gangbusters growth, they claim. You might not like the tweets, but you can\u2019t deny that his tax cuts and deregulation have jump-started the economy.\n\nBut those tax cuts, so far, have been a bust, never delivering the sustained surge in business investment that Trump surrogates promised. In fact, business investment shrank last quarter, and recent indicators suggest it could weaken further. That\u2019s partly because of Trump\u2019s trade wars, of course.\n\nMajor independent forecasters predict that the economy will grow about 2.2 percent in 2019. As I noted in a recent column, that means we added $2 trillion to federal deficits to get us to . . . the average growth rate we saw during President Barack Obama\u2019s second term.\n\nWell done, Mr. President.\n\nMoreover, Trump surrogates have never provided actual evidence for the assumed straight line between the president\u2019s deregulatory agenda and economic growth.\n\nSo let\u2019s consider the kinds of federal regulations that Trump has been rolling back, the ones that are supposedly boosting the economy.\n\nAs a case study, take the administration\u2019s decision Thursday to formally repeal a rule that granted expanded federal oversight of U.S. waterways. We are reverting to water-pollution standards from 1986 \u2014 a year from Trump\u2019s favorite decade, which was not exactly a high-water mark, so to speak, for environmental protections.\n\nFor context, this is one of many deregulatory actions Trump has taken to allow more pollution. Others include allowing power plants to dump more lead, arsenic and mercury into the water; relaxing restrictions on the release of methane and fine particulate matter into the air; and legalizing a pesticide linked to brain damage in children.\n\nThis latest case involved the bodies of water the federal government can protect under the Clean Water Act, which makes it illegal to pollute a \u201cwater of the United States\u201d without a permit. An Obama administration rule clarified that \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d include streams and wetlands that feed larger waterways, including those used for drinking water. The government cost-benefit analysis it produced at the time found that this rule produced net economic benefits.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s cost-benefit analysis, however, came to the opposite conclusion \u2014 chiefly because it abruptly decided that the largest category of benefits previously attributed to the rule could no longer be quantified at all. (The Trump administration said the research that had been used to quantify the benefits of protecting wetlands was too old, even though it cited even older research elsewhere in the same report.)\n\nTherefore, these benefits were effectively assigned a value of zero. Voila, the rule must go.\n\nThis legerdemath aside, it\u2019s not exactly clear how allowing greater water pollution would help supercharge economic growth. Sure, it might save some business a few bucks to be able to just dump toxic waste into a local tributary without a permit, but it\u2019s difficult to argue this kind of thing has a substantial positive impact on the overall economy or public welfare.\n\nAfter all, it\u2019s generally less costly to not pollute the water system in the first place than to try to clean it up once it\u2019s already polluted. Just ask Flint, Mich.\n\nMore broadly, this episode helps illustrate how Trump\u2019s allegedly economy-enhancing deregulatory agenda often relies on a false dichotomy: If a policy is pro-environment, it must not be pro-business.\n\nBut, in fact, several of the Trump administration\u2019s harmful deregulatory actions have faced significant opposition from the very businesses the administration claims to be helping.\n\nMajor players in the fossil-fuel industry have opposed that methane emissions relaxation I mentioned earlier, because they want to be able to make a credible case that natural gas can be clean and climate-friendly (or in any event, cleaner and climate-friendlier than some alternatives).\n\nThe auto industry has likewise opposed the administration\u2019s rollback of fuel-efficiency standards. Four major automakers hashed out a deal with California that sets efficiency floors above federal requirements and provides automakers more regulatory certainty so they can plan for the future. The supposedly pro-business Trump administration\u2019s response was to weaponize the Justice Department, launching a bogus antitrust investigation into the automakers.\n\nThe cumulative economic costs of such actions \u2014 based on damage to the environment, human health and rule of law \u2014 may be hard to fully quantify. But we know they\u2019re not zero.", "description": "Despite administration claims, the president\u2019s deregulatory agenda, so far, hasn\u2019t spurred the economic growth that was promised.", "authors": ["Catherine Rampell", "Columnist Covering Economics", "Public Policy", "Politics", "September At Pm", "Catherine Rampell Is An Opinion Columnist At The Washington Post.
