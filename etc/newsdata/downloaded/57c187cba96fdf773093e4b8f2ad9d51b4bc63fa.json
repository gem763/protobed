Carter is serving a 15-month sentence after it was revealed that she pushed Roy to end his life over text message and repeatedly chastised him when he hesitated.\n\n\u201cThe time is right and you are ready... just do it babe,\u201d Carter reportedly wrote in one message.\n\nThe district attorney said Monday that You\u2019s case is distinct in that she waged \u201ca complete and utter attack on this man\u2019s will and conscience and psyche,\u201d telling him to kill himself \u201cthousands of times\u201d over their 18-month relationship.\n\nOn May 20, Urtula\u2019s family was in town from New Jersey to watch him walk across the stage during his graduation from Boston College.\n\nHe never made it.\n\nBoston Globe via Getty More\n\n\u201cWhat appeared to be a self-inflicted horrific tragedy ended up being a lot more than that\u201d when authorities began looking through his cellphone, said Richard Sullivan, superintendent of the Transit Police Department.\n\nThe ensuing investigation revealed that You was \u201cphysically, verbally, and psychologically abusive\u201d to Urtula and was tracking his location on her phone the morning of his death, Rollins said.\n\nSchool officials said Urtula, a biology major, was a gifted student from Cedar Grove, New Jersey.\n\nHe was working as a researcher at a New York hospital after completing his coursework the previous December, said Joy Moore, the interim vice president of student affairs, when she announced Urtula\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cWhile today is a day for celebration, we ask you to take a moment to remember Alexander, his family, and friends in your prayers during this most difficult time,\u201d Moore said in May.\n\nSpeaking at the press conference on Monday, Rollins said that You \u201cmade demands and threats with the understanding that she had complete control\u201d over Urtula. She \u201cin fact was present when\u201d he killed himself, the district attorney added.\n\nThe indictment alleges that You\u2019s behavior \u201cwas wanton and reckless\u201d and that she \u201ccreated life-threatening conditions\u201d for Urtula.\n\nIn domestic abuse, said Rollins, \u201ca perpetrator is not limited by the gender or the gender of their partner.\u201d\n\nYou left for South Korea after Urtula\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cThere are any number of ways that we can try to extradite her back from Korea,\u201d said the district attorney. \u201cWe are fully fluent in the ways we can get her back if she doesn\u2019t want to do so voluntarily. We are cautiously optimistic that she will return on her own.\u201d\n\nIf you or a loved one are struggling with suicidal thoughts, please reach out to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), or contact the Crisis Text Line by texting TALK to 741741\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGot a tip?
