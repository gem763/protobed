Since the kids, it's hard to plan properly, make sure we have childcare so we just don't do it and I really miss that.'\n\nDuring their Cambridge punting date, the couple decide to look back at the photo of their 2015 date, with Paul exclaiming: 'Look how slim my face is!' to which Sam adds: 'Do you know what's going to be different from our selfie when we take it?!'\n\nWith Paul joking: 'Me being four stone heavier?'\n\nTo which a giggling Sam replies: 'No! I was just going to say, us looking older.

It goes all over, it's like you're swollen rather than flabby.'\n\nThe brunette beauty met Paul in an Essex bar in October 2014 following the split from her on-off TOWIE boyfriend Joey Essex.\n\nOlder: With Paul joking: 'Me being four stone heavier?'

(pictured in 2015, right)\n\nShe previously told MailOnline: 'I didn't expect to meet anyone... particularly after such an on-off relationship. I suppose they say it happens when you're not looking for it.'\n\nIt was revealed just ten months later that they were expecting their first child together and they welcomed son, Paul Jr., now three, in December 2015.\n\nThe couple went on to welcome their second child, a daughter called Rosie, now 22-months, in November 2017.\n\nOnly recently, Sam candidly spoke to MailOnline about her relationship with Paul and how they are constantly pressurised by fans to get married, but they don't let the comments bother them.\n\nSmitten: The brunette beauty met Paul in an Essex bar in October 2014 following the split from her on-off TOWIE boyfriend Joey Essex (pictured in 2015)\n\nSam said: 'I actually don't [feel pressurised]. I know everyone asks all the time, especially since Billie and Greg got married - it's been more heightened. It's really not top of my priorities.\n\n'I always say to Paul, he's not anyway, but I always say: \"Don't every feel pressure\" and he's like \"No, I don't.\"\n\n'I do look forward to when it does happen as it will be a whole new chapter for our lives. I don't mind that it's not happening right now as I'm really busy and I've got it to look forward to.\n\nPressures: Only recently, Sam candidly spoke to MailOnline about her relationship with Paul and how they are constantly pressurised by fans to get married, but they don't let the comments bother them\n\n'We've just done Billie and Greg's wedding, a big build up, so that was epic then I think we've got it all again to come. I think I'm alright holding off for a bit, it's exciting times ahead.'\n\nAnd when asked whether she would ever document her wedding on the series, Sam admitted: 'I haven't even thought about it, personally for me, it\u2019s part of my life, I\u2019ve done it forever.\n\n'I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just Paul\u2026 whether it\u2019s a decision Paul and I would have to make together.'\n\nThe Mummy Diaries continues at 9pm on ITVBe.", "description": "The TOWIE star,\u00a028, organises the romantic trip after revealing that they haven't been out for dinner just the two of them since she welcomed their second child, Rosie, in November 2017.", "authors": ["Olivia Wheeler For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/11/19484762-0-image-a-7_1570615978537.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
