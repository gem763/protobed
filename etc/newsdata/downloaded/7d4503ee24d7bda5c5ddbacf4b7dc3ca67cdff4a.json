This presents a potential risk to DOD personnel and family members, though there are no known specific credible threats to the opening of the Joker on 4 October.\n\nIncels are individuals who express frustration from perceived disadvantages to starting intimate relationships. Incel extremists idolize violent individuals like the Aurora movie theatre shooter. They also idolize the Joker character, the violent clown from the Batman series, admiring his depiction as a man who must pretend to be happy, but eventually fights back against his bullies.\n\nWhen entering theatres, identify two escape routes, remain aware of your surroundings, and remember the phrase \u201crun, hide, fight.\u201d Run if you can. If you\u2019re stuck, hide (also referred to as \u201csheltering in place\u201d), and stay quiet. If a shooter finds you, fight with whatever you can.\n\n** this is a condensed version of an HQ Army Materiel Command, G-3, Protection Division Security message **", "description": "The U.S. military cautioned service members on the potential for mass shooters at screenings of the \"Joker\" movie following extremist posts on social media.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8c17a71e00003000726424.png?cache=vmcwoigfuc&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
