Petrarca, according to listing agent Brandon Trentham, who shares the listing with his Compass colleagues Yoon Hoshue, Jill Camac and Lauren Feldesman.\n\n\n\nMore: Second Penthouse at 108 Leonard in Manhattan Lists for $9.15 Million\n\nPetrarca was \u201can architect who brought a modern sensibility to the old blocks of Tribeca,\u201d according to his 2003 obituary in the New York Times.\n\n\n\nThe newspaper referred specifically to the Petrarca-designed row of three houses that includes this property on Reade Street, noting that they \u201cevoke 19th-century loft buildings with red bricks, sweeping stone arches, multi-pane windows and cornices. Yet they are also clearly contemporary, with broad expanses of glass and exposed steel beams.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe owners, Michael George and Elaine Pang, who are both in finance, bought the house in 2005 for $7.4 million, property records show.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen we moved in, we spent two-and-a-half years gutting it and upgrading everything to our standard,\u201d Mr. George said in an email. \u201cAmong the larger jobs we did, we took off the wall at the top of the stairs and replaced it with a structural glass wall. Above it, we installed a steel spa; in the basement, we built a drainage system, installed false walls with old bricks and put in a zinc roof.\u201d\n\n\n\nThey also air-conditioned the basement vaults to create a proper wine cellar, he said.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Worldwise: Ennismore CEO Sharan Pasricha\u2019s Favorite Things\n\nOther notable features in the five-bedroom home include a sundeck that holds the stainless steel hot tub and has 360-degree views of the city, an elevator, an Italian marble and iron spiral staircase with a motion-activated lighting system, a balcony, a time-controlled fish tank and custom closets and cabinetry throughout.\n\n\n\nA townhouse in Tribeca is somewhat of a rarity. In fact, StreetEasy shows there is just one other townhouse currently on the market in the tony neighborhood.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Liz Lucking"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-108399?width=1280", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
