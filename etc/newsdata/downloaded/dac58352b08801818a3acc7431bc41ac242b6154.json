You\u2019ll know this if you saw the clip of Labour\u2019s Emily Thornberry on Question Time a week or so back tortuously trying, and failing, to explain her party\u2019s Brexit policy. So the Lib Dems\u2019 decision to declare that they will be revoking Article 50 if they win a majority at the next general election clearly has a lot going for it. But it also comes with dangerous downsides.\n\nOne thing it certainly does is distinguish the Lib Dems from Labour. There\u2019s no way that Corbyn can match that offer. So for those who think \u201cbollocks to Brexit\u201d (which Lib Dem activists, I learned down in Bournemouth, like to sing to the tune of Waltzing Matilda), Jo Swinson really is the only game in town.\n\nAs such, Revoke is essentially a heat-seeking missile aimed at die-hard Remain voters in the constituencies, most of them Tory, that the Lib Dems have a pretty good chance of winning as long as, that is, the anti-Brexit vote isn\u2019t split.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nTrue, even precision-guided weapons tend to result in some collateral damage. There will undoubtedly be some less-convinced Remain voters who will be put off by a policy that Labour and the Tories, having promised to implement the result of the 2016 referendum, are already labelling (without a great deal of justification some would say) as \u201cundemocratic\u201d.\n\nBut if we\u2019ve learned anything from the last three years, it\u2019s that you really can\u2019t have your cake and eat it. In politics, trade-offs come with the territory. And under first-past-the-post in particular, as the Lib Dems know better than anybody, it\u2019s not simply about how many votes you get, it\u2019s about where you get them.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. \u2018Brexit is like...\u2019 The Top 20 Twitter analogies Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.\" Shutterstock / sasha2109\n\nDoubters, some of them brave enough to voice their concerns about the policy down among the faithful in Bournemouth, worry that it will remove any chance they have of winning back some of the Eurosceptic south-west seats that, until they lost them in the post-coalition catastrophe of 2015, they\u2019d held through a combination of atavistic partisan loyalty and bloody hard work.\n\nWell, they may be right. But, although candidates fighting those former bastions of liberalism won\u2019t like to hear it (and may of course prove everyone wrong) those seats are very probably lost to them anyway. So if Revoke opens up possibilities in, say, London, where seats are genuinely in play, then that may well be a price worth paying.\n\nA bigger problem, perhaps, is that the policy is based on a transparent falsehood, fallacy and fantasy \u2013 namely that the Lib Dems are going to win the overall majority that will allow them to implement it.\n\nSure, stranger things have happened. But right now, it\u2019s painfully obvious that far fewer voters than ex-Labour and ex-Tory MPs are coming over to the Lib Dems. Current polling puts them at around 20 per cent, if that. True, political geography, as we\u2019ve already pointed out, matters. But, unless the numbers change significantly, it\u2019s going to have to weave some pretty dark magic to get them nearer to 330 than 30 seats in the Commons.\n\nDuring any election, then, Lib Dem spokespeople are almost certainly bound to find themselves forced by the media to admit that their central policy is undeliverable. They will be accused of making a promise they can\u2019t possibly keep, and asked if they risk letting down their supporters like they did over, oh, I don\u2019t know, the abolition of university tuition fees.\n\nThey may be able to handle that (they could argue that if they can\u2019t get what they want, then they will resume their call for a second referendum at which they will campaign for Remain). However, a trickier question would follow \u2013 namely, are they really saying, as Jo Swinson appears to be, that she won\u2019t under any circumstances help put Jeremy Corbyn into Downing Street, even if that ensures a second referendum will take place?\n\nWould doing that really be worse than happily entering into a coalition with David Cameron which, they\u2019ll be reminded by Labour, unleashed five years and more of austerity on some of the country\u2019s most vulnerable people?\n\nAnd all that ignores what some see as Revoke\u2019s biggest risk of all. It relies on Brexit not happening before the next election.\n\nIf Boris Johnson pulls off a miracle and takes the UK out of the EU by the time we troop back to the polls again, then the Lib Dems are going to look not so much like one-trick pony as a no-trick pony.\n\nBut hold your horses. That supposedly doomsday scenario might not be such a disaster, after all \u2013 at least for the Lib Dems if not for the country as a whole.\n\nIf we do leave, not everyone will be chuffed to bits or simply heaving a sigh of relief. And even those who are will soon find Brexit ain\u2019t really over. As for those who aren\u2019t, they will be angry \u2013 really angry \u2013 and they won\u2019t be much less angry with Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party than with Boris Johnson and the Tories.\n\nAt that point, \u201crevenge voting\u201d could become a thing \u2013 and perhaps a very big thing for Jo Swinson and the Liberal Democrats.", "description": "There\u2019s a lot to be said for clarity.
