Trump was faced with three complementary impulses: the political utility of opposing military conflicts, the ambitions of his \u201cfriend\u201d Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and his explicit indifference to the fate of the Kurds and the region.\n\nLate last month, about a week before the White House announced that it would allow Turkey free rein in the region, Trump praised the Kurds who\u2019d fought alongside the United States in the struggle against the Islamic State militant group (which is also known as ISIS).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey fought with us. They died with us. They died,\u201d Trump said after being asked how the United States would support the Kurds. \u201cWe lost \u2014 tens of thousands of Kurds died fighting ISIS. They died for us and with us. And for themselves. They died for themselves. But they\u2019re great people. And we have not forget \u2014 we don\u2019t forget \u2014 I don\u2019t forget. What happens someday later \u2014 but I can tell you that I don\u2019t forget.\u201d\n\nSince the call with Erdogan that kicked off the brutal new fighting in the region last week, Trump\u2019s view of the Kurds has been less generous. Speaking to reporters Wednesday, he waved away concerns about the fate of the Kurds by embracing their new alliance with the Syrian government \u2014 which was itself allied with Russia in tension with U.S. interests as the Syrian civil war unfolded.\n\n\u201cSyria\u2019s friendly with the Kurds. The Kurds are very well protected,\u201d Trump insisted. \u201cPlus, they know how to fight. And by the way, they\u2019re no angels, but they were with us. They are no angels, but they are fighting.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe \u201cno angels\u201d formulation is a classic form of victim-blaming. The Kurds being targeted by Turkey were our allies at the end of September, a \u201cgreat people\u201d \u2014 but now that they are being killed by Turkey, Trump wants us to know that they were perhaps morally impure.\n\nThe last time he publicly described a group using that term was in 2013, when he tweeted that the young black and Hispanic men who had been arrested for the rape of a jogger in Central Park in the 1980s were, in fact, \u201cno angels.\u201d On the campaign trail, he continued to insist on the guilt of the five men, despite their having been subsequently exonerated. At the time of their arrest, Trump responded by buying a full-page ad in New York tabloids calling for a reinstatement of the death penalty.\n\nThe Post\u2019s Dan Lamothe spoke with U.S. forces who\u2019d fought with the Kurds in the region.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt feels like we\u2019re abandoning our closest ally in the fight against ISIS, and we\u2019re abandoning them to a fate that is going to end very poorly for them,\u201d one told Lamothe. Another said he \u201c[couldn\u2019t] even look at the atrocities\u201d being committed against the Kurds.\n\nTrump also shrugged at an expansion of hostilities pitting Turkey against Syria directly.\n\n\u201cIf Syria wants to fight for their land, that\u2019s up to Turkey and Syria, as it has been for hundreds of years, they\u2019ve been fighting,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd the Kurds have been fighting for hundreds of years. That whole mess, it\u2019s been going along for a long time. Syria may have some help with Russia, and that\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of sand,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a lot of sand over there. So there\u2019s a lot of sand there that they can play with.\u201d\n\nThis is an unusually revealing comment from Trump. He likes to proclaim that he speaks with directness, though that\u2019s often just a term he uses to describe saying disrespectful things that aren\u2019t true. In this case, though, Trump\u2019s comments seem direct: Who cares. It\u2019s just sand. Let Syria and Turkey fight over it.\n\nAD\n\nIs there any doubt that this is sincerely how Trump feels? That, facing blowback over his acquiescence to Erdogan, he wants to reinforce that the Kurds bore some culpability for their fate and that the area\u2019s not worth defending anyway?\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not a policing agent, and it\u2019s time for us to come home,\u201d Trump said Wednesday by way of rationalizing the abandonment of the Kurds.\n\nAbout a minute later, his comments turned to another country in the region.\n\n\u201cYou read where we\u2019re sending some troops to Saudi Arabia. That\u2019s true, because we want to help Saudi Arabia. They have been a very good ally,\u201d Trump said.\n\nOne difference between these allies and the Kurds? Saudi Arabia was paying the United States for the troops. The negotiation over sending troops to Saudi Arabia, Trump added, \u201ctook a very short time. Like maybe about 35 seconds.\u201d\n\nLots of sand to play with there, too, but Trump didn\u2019t bring that up.\n\nAD", "description": "He also declared that the Kurds being targeted by Turkey were \"no angels.\"", "authors": ["Philip Bump", "National Correspondent Focused Largely On The Numbers Behind Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/miBXK_Y6Enhf81JhCrwz9zjy9Go=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-16-2019/t_169a040409be4ab1a1ef266b6e4cf7f4_name_d4d4519a_f02f_11e9_bb7e_d2026ee0c199_scaled.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
