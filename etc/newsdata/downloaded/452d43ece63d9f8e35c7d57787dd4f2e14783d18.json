The Palo Alto, California-based automaker declined to comment on the incident.\n\nThis less-than-ideal situation made headlines days after the chase ensued Friday night, exacerbating rumors that the department didn\u2019t follow policies regarding their patrol fleet, according to a department spokesperson.\n\nHowever, the department's public affairs manager, Geneva Bosques, said the mishap was nothing more than a lesson regarding their Tesla pilot progam.\n\nIn January of 2018, the department purchased a used 2014 Tesla Model S 85 in an effort to improve their efficency with a goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by \"25 percent from its 2005 baseline through economically practical strategies by the year 2020.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing modifications, the car hit the streets in March 2019.

When Hartman started nine hours later, around 2 p.m., the car was at 50 percent battery life. Per department policies, before a car is taken out, they are required to have at least a half a tank of gas or a 50 percent battery charge.\n\nIt wasn't until the end of Hartman's shift when a roughly 10-minute pursuit ensued, causing Hartman to draw concerns over his battery life. Fortunately, Hartman was surrounded by several officers who were readily available to take over the No. 1 position if needed.\n\nWithin the first six months of the pilot program, the car has been in two high-speed pursuits, according to the department, which added that the car has so far exceeded expectations and has more power than its average patrol car.\n\nIn regards to Friday, the department chalks it up to nothing more than \"running out of gas\" which happens often but rarely makes headlines.", "description": "Amid a high-speed police pursuit in Northern California with speeds exceeding 100 miles per hour, a mazed officer noticed a warning in his car\u2014it was running low on electricity.", "authors": ["Daniella Genovese"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Tesla-Fremont-PD.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
