They\u2019re both smart people. \u2026 They do wonderful work,\u201d he told \u201cAmerica\u2019s News HQ.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut they\u2019re pushing a case that falls apart from the sheer weight of its lunacy, as though the Hollywood community needs to be purged of this social and intellectual hygiene problem called conservative thinking. It underscores the fact that we aren\u2019t receptive to a diversity of thought which is the exact opposite of what you feel the liberal way would be, and I find that obscene,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Hurley, who played Elaine\u2019s boss J. Peterman in 22 episodes over the last few seasons of \u201cSeinfeld.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump plans a Sept. 17 fundraiser in Beverly Hills, which prompted the \u201cWill & Grace\u201d co-stars to call for donors to be publicly disclosed.\n\n\u201cThe public has a right to know,\u201d Ms. Messing wrote on Twitter in support of Mr. McCormack\u2019s calling for the list to be printed \u201cso the rest of us can be clear about who we don\u2019t wanna work with.\u201d\n\nMr. O\u2019Hurley attributed liberals\u2019 fondness for Internet dogpiles and doxxing to be in the nature of their ideology.\n\n\u201cI think they have the bully pulpit right now to say it out loud,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Hurley said. \u201cI think there is a nature among liberal thinkers to form packs, to form groups, whereas the conservative mind is basically an individual, and they\u2019re tougher to find.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
