Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota dropping the extremely obvious \u201cHouston, we have a problem\u201d line during her opening statement to Sen. Kamala Harris of California comparing President Donald Trump to the Wizard of Oz, some lines had viewers cracking up while others fell flat, to say the least.\n\nWe\u2019ve rounded up some of the best and worst moments, and the assorted reactions to them on Twitter.\n\nSen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and his dual-language response to a question about his veganism:\n\nCory Booker and these jokes are a theme.\n\n\n\nQ: Should people, including Latin Americans, become vegans like you?\n\n\n\n\"No,\" Cory Booker says before turning to the dad jokes we all know him for having.\n\n\n\n\"I want to translate that into Spanish, 'No.' \" \u2014 Yamiche Alcindor (@Yamiche) September 13, 2019\n\nBooker's dad joke energy is strong tonight.

That is so spot on and accurate. #DemDebate \u2014 Sarah Nicole \ud83d\udc8b\ud83d\udc84\ud83c\udf39\ud83d\udc1d (@miss_flawless4) September 13, 2019\n\nTrump is definitely no wizard, but he is that #ReallySmallDude fooling some of the people in America and playing this country as if he was the Wizard of Oz. #staywoke pic.twitter.com/PwSHBf2L79 \u2014 C.

Stokes (@RobertFStokes1) September 13, 2019\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Asian so I know a lot of doctors.\u201d LOL @AndrewYang. He also said that we are talking about healthcare all wrong. It should be a given, a right, so that Americans can go about living our lives & fulfilling our dreams. Agree! #DemDebate \u2014 Leana Wen, M.D. (@DrLeanaWen) September 13, 2019\n\nAndrew Yang saying he\u2019s Asian and knows a lot of doctors is a bit jarring. As an Asian American doctor, I\u2019ve seen my share of model minority stereotypes. But seeing an Asian guy on the presidential debate stage is the biggest source of pride I\u2019ve felt in a long time. #DemDebate \u2014 Eugene Gu, MD (@eugenegu) September 13, 2019\n\nAnd finally, to summarize:\n\nHarris: \"Trump is like the guy in Wizard of Oz HAHAHA\"\n\n\n\nBooker: \"Let me translate that into Spanish: 'No.' Hehehe\"\n\n\n\nKlobuchar: \"It's like the Day After Tomorrow but Today lol\"\n\n\n\nAmerica: \"Please kill me now\" \u2014 Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) September 13, 2019\n\nKAMALA: I\u2019m not Trump\n\nBETO: \u201cNo\u201d (in Spanish)\n\nKLOBUCHAR: You betcha I ate a salad with a comb.\n\nBERNIE: Make Medicare, Not War\n\nBOOKER: Dagnabit!
