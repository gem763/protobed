But for many Members of Parliament \u2013 especially women MPs \u2013 the impact is personal as they face routine threats and intimidation, both in person and online.\n\nMPs have reported a sharp increase in the number of threats of murder, rape and assault they have received from individuals angry at their stance on Brexit and other political issues. An all-party parliamentary committee report released on October 18 said that abuse of MPs is now \u201ccommonplace\u201d and that it is \u201cundermining their engagement with constituents, how they express themselves on social media, and carry out their democratic duties\u201d.\n\nThe murder of West Yorkshire MP Jo Cox just days before the 2016 referendum on whether the UK should remain or leave the European Union shocked the country, but now many MPs fear that they or one of their parliamentary colleagues will be next as the deeply polarised sentiment around Brexit leaches into other areas of public discourse.\n\nOn Thursday we\u2019ll get the thoughts of MPs and other public figures involved in the Brexit debate and consider what\u2019s needed to guarantee their safety and keep UK democracy open, transparent and accountable. Join the conversation.\n\nRead more:\n\n'Abuse is virtually constant': female MPs speak about the threats they face \u2013 The Guardian\n\nThe UK is spending record sums keeping politicians safe since an MP's murder - Quartz\n\n\n\nWhat do you think?
