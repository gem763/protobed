Huawei may be, according to various U.S critics, any or all of the following:\n\nComplicit in Chinese espionage.\n\nSubject to Chinese policy that could force it to be complicit in espionage in the future.\n\nA beneficiary of theft of trade secrets.\n\nA violator of trade sanctions.\n\nAnd all this is also intertwined with President Trump's trade negotiations with Beijing.\n\nThe intrigue: If you set aside the potential espionage and other crimes, Huawei is an attractive supplier for 5G equipment. It offers price advantages in a thinly populated market for 5G equipment, and shunning the firm would harm Germany's economic relationship with China.\n\nGermany has argued it can take other steps to protect its cellphone infrastructure even if it uses Huawei's equipment. On Tuesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel pushed back on the Trump administration's warning, saying Germany would define its own security standards, per Reuters.\n\nWhat they're saying: Historically, presidents try not to play chicken with our allies.\n\n\"Public threats with regard to intelligence sharing are not the way to go to influence policy in Berlin or anywhere else,\" said Michael Morell, former deputy director of the CIA and current host of the Intelligence Matters podcast.\n\nAnd the U.S. comes out ahead by sharing, noted Chris Painter, the State Department's former top diplomat for cybersecurity issues. \"The U.S. shares sensitive information on threats and other issues for its own benefit \u2014 not just the benefit of the receiving country. Halting such sharing would undercut our ability to be aware of and collectively counter shared threats and would be shooting ourself in the foot.\"\n\nMeanwhile, President Trump remains a wild card in the struggle to implement his own policies.", "description": "Washington is waging an international campaign to sour the world on China's Huawei.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/0-Uj7nmSuqOPNiH5XevrCfMNTA4=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/03/12/1552404404205.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-12"}
