They\u2019re hoping that there\u2019s internet-only customers out there that don\u2019t already have a Roku, an Amazon, an Apple, a Chrome Cast, a PlayStation, Xbox, I don\u2019t really understand that. Honestly, those boxes are sold a ton.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know of anybody who has an internet-only service and goes, \u2018but I have no way to stream anything because I have no box and I have no smart TV. Doesn\u2019t everybody have one a smart TV or one streaming box in their house?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NBC streaming service, Peacock, is supposed to launch with a huge back catalog, including \"The Office\" and \"Parks & Recreation,\" which have been on Netflix, as well as new series, including reboots of \"Saved by the Bell,\" and \"Punky Brewster\" as well as a highly-anticipated reboot of \"Battlestar Galactica\" from \"Mr. Robot\" creator Sam Esmail.\n\nComcast reportedly will charge around $10 per month for Peacock, but Rayburn does not see this having much impact in terms of appeal. \u201cYou\u2019re basically paying to rent a box from Comcast that has their guide on it, and yeah, you can buy movies and TV shows through it, but why would you do that through Comcast. Why wouldn\u2019t you do that through iTunes or Google Store? Why wouldn\u2019t you use a streaming subscription service?\" asked Rayburn.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/09/0/0/Comcast.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
