The president also thanked Russia, Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Syrian Kurds for their assistance in the strike, but emphasized that US agents were at the heart of the operation.\n\nNewsweek first reported that Baghdadi was believed to have been killed.\n\nTrump first sparked excitement later on Saturday night, when he tweeted after the operation had concluded that \"Something very big has just happened!\" The White House later announced that Trump was slated to make a \"major statement\" Sunday at 9:00 a.m.\n\nAl-Baghdadi's killing marks a major victory for US forces after the reclusive leader has spent the last five years in hiding while the United States placing a $25 million bounty on his head in 2016.\n\nTrump called the former leader a \"sick and depraved man\" who \"was vicious and violent and he died in a vicious and violent way,\" and that the \"world is now a much safer place.\"", "description": "Trump said he \"wanted to make sure this kept secret, I didn't want to have men lost, and women, I didn't want people lost.\"", "authors": ["Ellen Cranley"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db5a776dee01951aa38b1e2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
