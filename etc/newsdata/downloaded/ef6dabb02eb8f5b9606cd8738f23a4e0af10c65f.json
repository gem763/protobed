It hopes for a \u201cnear term\u201d agreement allowing the two companies to retain their earnings, Mnuchin said in an interview with Fox Business Network.\n\n\u201cThey have been in conservatorship too long and we want to make sure they\u2019re not in conservatorship on a permanent basis,\u201d Mnuchin said of the two companies that guarantee more than half of the mortgages in the United States.\n\n\u201cSo our first choice is to work with Congress on a bipartisan basis, but if we can\u2019t do that we\u2019re perfectly comfortable moving for it on the administrative side.\u201d\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac securities soared on Monday, with their preferred shares last up more than 15 percent, while the common stock was up more than 19%.\n\nThe Treasury said on Thursday the government should draw up a plan to begin recapitalizing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, while calling on Congress to act on comprehensive housing reform.\n\nMnuchin said he hoped to get Congress on board in three to six months, otherwise \u201cwe\u2019ll move on, on the administrative front.\u201d\n\nMnuchin, as well as other top housing officials, will testify on Tuesday before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee on the report. Investors will listen closely for further detail on the administration\u2019s plan, as well as whether Congress is interested in pursuing housing finance legislation.\n\nThe Treasury holds warrants representing 80% of Fannie and Freddie\u2019s common stock, as well as senior preferred stock agreements that allow it to sweep the firms\u2019 profits into its coffers. That arrangement has left Fannie and Freddie with just around $3 billion of capital each.\n\nOn Friday, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overruled a lower court that had backed the federal government\u2019s claim to those profits. The ruling clears the way for Fannie and Freddie investors to make legal claims for a share of the companies\u2019 profits.\n\nMnuchin said an agreement with FHFA allowing the two companies to keep their earnings \u201cwill be a significant increase in capital.\u201d\n\nHe said it was unclear when he Fannie and Freddie would come out of conservatorship.", "description": "U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Monday the Trump administration would take administrative measures to overhaul mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac if it failed to secure congressional support for its plan within six months.", "authors": ["Pete Schroeder", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427947459&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF88154", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
