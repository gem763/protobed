It\u2019ll be a good challenge but we\u2019re definitely up for it.\"\n\nFront-rankers Tendai Mtawarira and Bongi Mbonambi, as well as Lood de Jager retain their places in the starting line-up, having been elevated to the XV from the one which lost against New Zealand in the opening match of the tournament.\n\nThe starting XV boasts 665 caps - the most in a Springbok team since the 2015 Rugby World Cup - when the squad included three Test centurions in Jean de Villiers, Victor Matfield and Bryan Habana.\n\n\"When we set out on this campaign at the start of last season, one of the things we said we wanted to do was broaden and deepen the experience in the squad,\" said Erasmus.\n\n\"We're now in a position where everyone in the starting XV has had a proper taste of top-level Test rugby and we've got a strong spine of Test experience for these high-pressure matches.\n\n\"You need that experience when it comes to handling the pressure situations we will face on Sunday and I think we've achieved that now.\"\n\nThe team to meet Japan contains five players with 50 or more caps in Willie le Roux, Duane Vermeulen (who wins 50th cap as a No 8 - a Springbok record), Pieter-Steph du Toit, Eben Etzebeth and centurion Mtawarira.\n\nThere are another four players in the 40s in Kolisi, De Jager, De Allende and Handr\u00e9 Pollard. Twelve of the starting XV - and 21 of the 23 - were in the team that overcame Japan six-tries-to-one (41-7) in Kumagaya, Japan, six weeks ago.\n\nThe only absentees are Trevor Nyakane (prop) and Jesse Kriel (centre), who have both been invalided out of the tournament. De Jager and prop Vincent Koch - who is on the bench - are the only two players who were not in the match 23 for the victory over Japan.\n\nErasmus again announced a six-two replacement split in favour of the forwards (rather than the traditional five-three), as was successfully deployed against the Azzurri.\n\n\"We will look at our replacement strategy on a game-by-game basis and for this opponent on this occasion we believe we\u2019ll need fresh legs among the forwards at some point,\" said Erasmus.\n\n\"We're very fortunate in that we have a squad that has a number of highly versatile players among forwards and backs who can slot into a number of positions to cover all eventualities.\"\n\nThe Springboks are aiming to reach the Rugby World Cup semi-finals for the fifth time in seven appearances while, for Japan, it is their first appearance in the play-off rounds at the ninth attempt.\n\nThe winner will play the victor in the France v Wales match in Yokohama on Sunday, October 27.\n\nSouth Africa's quarter-final with Japan kicks off at 12:15 (SA time) on Sunday.\n\nTeams:\n\nJapan\n\nTBA\n\nSouth Africa\n\n15 Willie le Roux, 14 Cheslin Kolbe, 13 Lukhanyo Am, 12 Damian de Allende, 11 Makazole Mapimpi, 10 Handre Pollard, 9 Faf de Klerk, 8 Duane Vermeulen, 7 Pieter-Steph du Toit, 6 Siya Kolisi (captain), 5 Lood de Jager, 4 Eben Etzebeth, 3 Frans Malherbe, 2 Bongi Mbonambi, 1 Tendai Mtawarira\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Malcolm Marx, 17 Steven Kitshoff, 18 Vincent Koch, 19 RG Snyman, 20 Franco Mostert, 21 Francois Louw, 22 Herschel Jantjies, 23 Frans Steyn\n\n- SA Rugby", "description": "Springbok coach Rassie Erasmus has named his team for their Rugby World Cup quarter-final clash against Japan.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9445/23a4df0ba8844f4da85a20554710d07d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
