Here are four tips to negotiate your dream role", "language": "en", "text": "1. Apply for a dream job even if it\u2019s not advertised as flexible\n\n\u201cThe easiest way to describe flexible working is if you have flexibility on where, when, or how much you work,\u201d says Karen Mattison, joint CEO and co-founder of Timewise. \u201cWhat I would advise is to find the job you want to apply for, and even if there\u2019s no mention of flexibility, apply anyway\u2026 assume that it\u2019s something that you can negotiate later.\u201d\n\n\u201cIdeally, it would be good to do some research on the organisation because if they don\u2019t do flexible working for their current staff, it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll offer it to a new person. But if they\u2019ve got a culture of flexible working and part-time working is quite normal, which many businesses have now, it\u2019s more likely that they will be open to that as a negotiation point. My personal feeling is if they are not asking you [in the job interview] about flexible working options, don\u2019t mention it too early in the [job application] process.\u201d\n\n2. Don\u2019t be afraid of negotiating\n\n\u201cI think the focus of the interview and the hiring process should be on whether you are the right person for the job and do they want you,\u201d says Karen Mattison. \u201cOnce they want you, then you\u2019re in a position to negotiate flexibility. You may not get everything you want, but your currency is much higher because you\u2019re the preferred candidate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe challenge is that it\u2019s like poker - when do you show your hand? If you do it too soon, and the employer hasn\u2019t fallen in love with you yet, you just become that annoying person who just says what they can and can\u2019t do before you\u2019ve actually got the job. Once the employer wants you, then you\u2019re in a negotiation situation and we now know that nine out of 10 employers are open to discussing some form of flexibility for the right candidate. Once you know you\u2019re the right candidate, that\u2019s a different kind of conversation.\u201d", "description": "Advice from Karen Mattison, joint CEO of Timewise, a flexible working consultancy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07nvvq0.jpg"}
