We need to win, but finals arrive later.'\n\nBarcelona's Luis Suarez wheels away after netting the winner against Inter Milan in a 2-1 win\n\nThe former Italy and Juventus coach said he felt that every game the team played was important, and that the key to success was consistency in their approach.\n\n'There's a need to pick up an important result in every game, so our approach won't change tomorrow, not even our idea or mentality.\n\n'I don't go back, this is my idea of \u200b\u200bfootball. Going backwards would mean standing in a line behind the ball and waiting to be slapped.\n\n'We want to slap them instead. I can't change, whether it's for Lazaro, Godin or anyone else.'\n\nTheir upcoming opponents Dortmund are unbeaten in both their Champions League games so far this season, beating Slavia Prague 2-0 away from home before holding Barcelona to a 0-0 draw at home.\n\nBorussia Dortmund are unbeaten in the Champions League and drew 0-0 with Barcelona\n\nOn the weekend Inter came away from Sassuolo with a 4-3 win, with strikers Lautaro Martinez and Romelu Lukaku each scoring a brace, but Conte wants the team to focus on their own performance against Dortmund after shipping three goals.\n\n'We prefer to think about ourselves,' he added. 'We conceded three goals against Sassuolo through the balls we lost.\n\n'We must be careful against Borussia because they\u2019re very good on the break. We know this, but we want to play our football too.'", "description": "Ex-Chelsea manager Conte has favoured a 3-5-2 system this season, which has been effective in Serie A, but failure to beat the Germans could put Inter at risk of crashing out of the Champions League.", "authors": ["Oli Gamp For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/16/20043536-0-image-a-39_1571759814934.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
