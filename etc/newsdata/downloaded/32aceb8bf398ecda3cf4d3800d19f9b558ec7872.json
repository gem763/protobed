The comedian was widely condemned and lost sponsors, hosting gigs and tour dates over the stunt. She said she was investigated for months by the Department of Justice and placed on the federal no-fly list during that time.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ms. Griffin repeated her claims that she\u2019s been blacklisted in Hollywood over the incident.\n\n\u201cI still do not have one single day of paid work ahead of me for the rest of my life. Now, you tell me that\u2019s not because I\u2019m a 58-year-old female in comedy,\u201d she claimed.\n\nKTLA\u2019s Mark Kriski chimed in, saying, \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of 58-year-old comedians that are working out there.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre ya?\u201d Ms. Griffin shot back. \u201cName five women.\u201d\n\nMr. Kriski said he\u2019s \u201cnot into the comedy thing,\u201d before Ms. Griffin interrupted with, \u201cI thought so.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s with the new guy?\u201d she asked the other anchors. \u201cLook, the point is, it\u2019s a male-dominated field, which I really don\u2019t want to hear your take on that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got guests here every day,\u201d Mr. Kriski responded.\n\n\u201cYeah, OK, that\u2019s all right,\u201d Ms. Griffin scoffed. \u201cBut you should know your stats, though.\n\n\u201cAnyway, working in a male-dominated field is something where I deal with that sort of thing every day,\u201d she continued, referring to Mr. Kriski\u2019s comment. \u201cSo I spend most of my day trying to talk to older white guys and explain, \u2018I just want to do what I do.\u2019\u201d\n\nNotably, five working female comedians over the age of 58 include Ellen DeGeneres, Joy Behar, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Roseanne Barr and Whoopi Goldberg.\n\nMs. Griffin later posted a clip of the exchange on Twitter.\n\nEvery once in a while, Momma has to get a little savage. pic.twitter.com/ur0CaVvtuu \u2014 Kathy Griffin (@kathygriffin) October 23, 2019\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
