A search of the immediate area did not locate him,\" the release states.\n\nPolice are urging the public to avoid engaging with Mathews if they see him, and to contact police immediately.\n\n\"The RCMP believe Mr. Mathews may be under a significant amount of pressure due to this ongoing investigation and the extensive media coverage it has garnered,\" the release says.\n\nThere are no indications Mathews has crossed into the U.S., an RCMP spokesperson later told CBC News. Sgt. Paul Manaigre said via email other law enforcement agencies, including the Canada Border Services Agency, have been notified.\n\nManaigre also said there's no indication Mathews knew the owner of the property where his vehicle was found.\n\nMounties swarmed Mathews' home in Beausejour, Man., on Aug. 19 and seized a number of firearms after a Winnipeg Free Press investigation into the Base, a neo-Nazi group trying to establish itself in Manitoba. Mathews was neither arrested nor charged with any crime.\n\nA spokesperson confirmed Aug. 25 that the eight-year member of the reserves had been released from the Canadian Armed Forces.\n\nThe next day, the RCMP said he had gone missing.\n\nHe is being investigated by the RCMP and the Forces for alleged ties to the Base, described by anti-hate activists as a white supremacist group that tries to get its members into the military to train for what it says is a coming race war.\n\nMathews worked as a combat engineer and had basic explosives training as a member of the Winnipeg-based 38 Canadian Brigade Group. The former master corporal had also received leadership training and was in charge of a group of reserve soldiers.\n\nPosters for the Base appeared on the streets in Winnipeg this summer, and Mathews is alleged to have been involved in trying to recruit new members.\n\nMathews went missing shortly after his alleged links to a neo-Nazi group were reported by the Winnipeg Free Press. (Courtney Rutherford/CBC)\n\nThere were conflicting initial accounts from the Forces over when they first became aware of Mathews' alleged link to the Base.\n\nHis brigade commander told the media the military had no knowledge of the alleged link in May, when Mathews worked his last shift with the reserves. Days later, Chief of Defence Staff Gen. Jonathan Vance said the military's counter-intelligence unit became aware of it in April.\n\nThe military has refused to provide details of its investigation.\n\nAnyone with information of his whereabouts is asked to contact RCMP at 204-268-1234 or Crime Stoppers anonymously at 1-800-222-8477.
