He marveled at the fighting, saying, \u201cIt was pretty vicious,\u201d and adding,\u201cIt was nasty.. . .It\u2019s not fun having bullets going all over the place.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump defended his handling of the situation because, as he saw it, he had given the Turks and Kurds a lesson in \u201ctough love.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout a little tough love \u2014 you know what tough love is, right? \u2014 they would\u2019ve never made this deal,\u201d Trump said. He thanked Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for being \u201ca gentleman\u201d in agreeing to a five-day cease-fire during negotiations Thursday in Ankara with a U.S. delegation led by Vice President Pence.\n\nTrump\u2019s withdrawal of troops in Syria drew sharp and sustained criticism from across the political spectrum, including from some of his staunchest Republican allies in Congress. But he claimed Thursday, \u201cnow they\u2019re all happy, and I\u2019m happy with them.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump made his comments from center stage at the American Airlines Center, where an estimated 20,000 people packed the arena for his often meandering, one-hour-and-27-minute speech. He received some of his loudest applause when he vowed to stop \u201cendless wars\u201d and vowed to \u201cbring our soldiers back home.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOutside the arena in downtown Dallas, hundreds of protesters \u2014 many of them Kurdish American \u2014 gathered with Kurdistan flags and signs denouncing Turkey\u2019s invasion of Syria. There was a massive red sign that read: \u201cKurds lost 11,000 lives. Trump rewarded them a \u2018great betrayal.\u2019\u201d And there were chants of: \u201cWe want Turkey out of NATO,\u201d and \u201cTrump betrayed the Kurds!\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump flips on his ideals so fast and it\u2019s so sad that one Sunday night he just decided, \u2018I\u2019m going to change how I feel\u2019 and the rest of the government is just letting him do it,\u201d said Fran Guzman, 32, a teacher who lives in Dallas. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBilal Omar, 37, came to the rally with his two young children. In 1988, Omar\u2019s family fled their home in Iraq after a chemical weapon attack and spent several years in refugee camps before eventually resettling in upstate New York in 1994. Omar moved to Arlington, Tex., six years ago and works as a real estate agent and tax preparer.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFor the past many years, the U.S. has been fighting and many Kurds have been killed trying to liberate that area \u2014 and in a matter of hours, Trump gave it to Russia, Iran and Syria, as if nothing has happened,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Kurds stand up for [American troops], they took bullets for them, they never thought in a million years that the U.S. would just turn its back.\u201d\n\nOmar accused Trump of making this decision to distract from the impeachment proceedings. He looked across the street at Trump supporters walking into the rally and said: \u201cThey don\u2019t even understand what\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nFarther down the street, a group of friends who are in a motorcycle club together said they agree with the president\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cWhy do we need to have our soldiers over there for decades. When is a good time to pull out? If not now, when? Why do we have to have our soldiers dying for people that don\u2019t care about us?\u201d said Aaron Ferguson, 30, a diesel mechanic who lives south of Dallas in Glenn Heights.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not our war,\u201d said Heather Sumrall, 40, a medical assistant instructor from Alvarado, Tex. \u201cWhy are we over there fighting their civil war? It\u2019s their civil war. That would be like a husband and a wife fighting and then the neighbor comes over. That\u2019s none of your business.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nInside at the rally, Trump continued his weeks-long assault on congressional Democrats who are leading the impeachment inquiry into his conduct in office, which Democratic leaders say is an unconstitutional abuse of power.\n\nThe president repeatedly slammed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) as \u201ccrazy\u201d and he claimed a \u201cgreat betrayal\u201d by House Democrats and the media to \u201coverthrow\u201d the results of the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t believe anymore that they love our country,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\nTrump added, \u201cThey continue the outrageous impeachment witch hunt with nothing \u2014 with nothing. They come after me, but what they\u2019re really doing is they\u2019re coming after the Republican Party, and what they\u2019re really, really doing is they\u2019re coming after and fighting you. And we never lose.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "At a campaign rally in Dallas, the president thanked Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for being \u201ca gentleman\u201d in agreeing to a five-day cease-fire during negotiations with a U.S. delegation led by Vice President Pence.", "authors": ["Philip Rucker", "White House Bureau Chief", "Jenna Johnson", "National Political Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/upG3upYi9s9jFTfO6tMiuvWn8VY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GDAGLJXRKMI6TCPL5RLM2QKHGI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
