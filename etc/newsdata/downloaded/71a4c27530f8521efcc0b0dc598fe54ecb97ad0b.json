Sign up here.\n\nThe U.S. and China agreed on the outlines of a partial trade accord Friday that President Donald Trump said he and his counterpart Xi Jinping could sign as soon as next month.\n\nAs part of the deal, China would significantly step up purchases of U.S. agricultural commodities, agree to certain intellectual-property measures and concessions related to financial services and currency, Trump said Friday at the White House. In exchange, the U.S. will delay a tariff increase due next week as the deal is finalized, though new levies scheduled for December haven\u2019t yet been called off.\n\nThe agreement marks the largest breakthrough in the 18-month trade war that has hurt the economies of both nations. Importantly, Trump said the deal was the first phase of a broader agreement. The president indicated he could sign a deal with Xi at an upcoming November summit in Chile.\n\nWhile the limited agreement may resolve some short-term issues, several of the thorniest disputes remain outstanding. U.S. goals in the trade war center around accusations of intellectual-property theft, forced technology transfer and complaints about Chinese industrial subsidies.\n\nXi told Trump in a letter -- which the White House distributed on Friday -- that it\u2019s important the countries work together to address each others\u2019 concerns. \u201cI hope the two sides will act in the principle and direction you and I have agreed to, and work to advance China-U.S. relations based on coordination, cooperation and stability,\u201d the letter said.\n\nPhase Two\n\nThe Trump administration also said issues related to Huawei Technologies Co. aren\u2019t part of Friday\u2019s deal and will be a separate process. The Chinese telecommunications equipment maker, which was placed on an export blacklist in May, will be discussed in a second phase of the negotiations, the president told reporters later Friday.\n\nEquities advanced globally Friday amid growing conviction that the world\u2019s two biggest economies would negotiate a trade truce, though U.S. stocks pared gains after Trump\u2019s announcement near the close of trading. Trump tweeted earlier Friday that if the countries did reach an agreement, he would be able to sign it without a lengthy congressional approval process.\n\nTrump\u2019s announcement drew a wary welcome from even Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cAfter so much has been sacrificed, Americans will settle for nothing less than a full, enforceable and fair deal with China,\u201d Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley said in a statement after the announcement. \u201cFarmers in Iowa know far too well that the trade war has caused real financial pain in the heartland. But we need to know more about this deal and follow-through from China will be key.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday and earlier Friday, Liu and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer held the first senior-level discussions between Washington and Beijing since a previous agreement fell apart in May and tariffs were raised in the months after.\n\nWhat Our Economists Say\n\n\u201cPast experience is that U.S.\u2013China trade agreements aren\u2019t worth the paper they are written on, and this one hasn\u2019t even been written down. For now, though, indications on trade are a little more positive. If that persists, it could help put a floor under sliding global growth.\u201d\n\nTom Orlik and Yelena Shulyatyeva, Bloomberg Economics\n\nClick here for the full note\n\nThe U.S. was threatening to increase tariffs on Tuesday on about $250 billion of Chinese imports to 30% from 25%. More duties on $160 billion of Chinese products were targeted for Dec. 15.\n\nThe threat of those import taxes on U.S. consumers, falling around the holiday season, raised the prospect that the U.S. economy would slide toward a recession heading into Trump\u2019s 2020 reelection bid. The American manufacturing industry, which Trump vowed in 2016 to revitalize, is already contracting in part because of the trade war.\n\nThe Trump administration said that as part of the deal, China would scale its purchases of U.S. farm goods over two years to an annual total of $40 billion to $50 billion. Trump encouraged U.S. farmers to buy more land and Deere & Co. tractors in response.\n\nChina in recent weeks had already discussed buying more U.S. products such as soybeans, pork and wheat. Some traders remained skeptical that buying soybeans from the U.S. represented a significant breakthrough in the overall trade talks, Bloomberg reported Friday.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars.
