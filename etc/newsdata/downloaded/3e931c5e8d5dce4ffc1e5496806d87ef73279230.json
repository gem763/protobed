The day after the release of Michael Horowitz\u2019s damning inspector general report on the former FBI director, Trump blasted Comey for attempting a \u201ccoup\u201d against his administration. Trump helpfully ended his tweetstorm with the Fox & Friends clip that apparently inspired it, in which former CIA analyst and \u201cDemocratic strategist\u201d Bryan Dean Wright demanding more action against \u201cComey, [former CIA director John] Brennan, and the rest of these characters\u201d:\n\nBoth Wright and Steve Doocy criticized Attorney General William Barr for not imposing \u201cconsequences\u201d on Comey for his \u201ccoup\u201d attempt. If Trump and Barr don\u2019t press charges, Wright says, it will result in one of two damaging outcomes. Either conservative elements in the intelligence/law enforcement communities will attempt a coup in the next Democratic administration as revenge, or outrage will force the disbanding of these agencies \u2014 both of which would be dangerous to the US, Wright warns.\n\nThat\u2019s the kind of argument that would have set off a righteous attack from Trump on his previous AG and his lack of action against Trump\u2019s political enemies. Curiously, however, Trump used the opportunity to praise Barr for his restraint:\n\nThe disastrous IG Report on James Comey shows, in the strongest of terms, how unfairly I, and tens of millions of great people who support me, were treated. Our rights and liberties were illegally stripped away by this dishonest fool. We should be given our stolen time back? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 30, 2019\n\nThe fact that James Comey was not prosecuted for the absolutely horrible things he did just shows how fair and reasonable Attorney General Bill Barr is. So many people and experts that I have watched and read would have taken an entirely different course. Comey got Lucky! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 30, 2019\n\nSomewhere in Alabama, Jeff Sessions is beating his head against his desk.\n\nTrump\u2019s correct about Barr\u2019s restraint, although it\u2019s surprising to see Trump value that. The Horowitz report speaks for itself in laying out all of the ways in which Comey abused his authority and access for political purposes, but prosecuting him over the leaks would have been very difficult. Technically, Comey mishandled classified information, but selling that to a jury when the material (but not the information itself) was only classified retroactively would have been tough. A prosecution would have looked more political than a non-prosecution.\n\nSo why is Trump so sanguine that \u201cComey got lucky\u201d after making the former FBI director one of his main betes noires over the past two years? Perhaps Trump sees the Comey report as vindication enough for his attacks. It might also be that Trump expects Horowitz\u2019 next report on the broader issues of Operation Crossfire Hurricane to be even more damning, and maybe provide stronger evidence of actionable misconduct. This report was just an appetizer, after all \u2014 if a coup really was attempted, that\u2019s the main course.", "description": "\"Comey got Lucky!\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Taylor Millard", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Andrew Malcolm"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/wright-coup.png"}
