However, it might provide some context that could temper the hysteria swirling around Ukraine-Gate, the allegation that Trump abused his authority to pressure Volodymyr Zelensky into investigating Hunter Biden. Newsweek picks up on an interview conducted by Russian reporters with the Ukrainian president, who scoffed that he could have felt pressure by Trump in the first place (via Twitchy):\n\n\u0417\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0421\u041c\u0418:\n\n\u0415\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0442\u044c \u2013 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0443, \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0430, \u0441\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f, \u043d\u0438 \u0443 \u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0442, \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043c \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0443-\u0442\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0447\u044c. pic.twitter.com/inCQ3yb9Ej \u2014 \u0420\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d \u0420\u044f\u0431\u0447\u0443\u043a (@ryabtchuk_roman) September 25, 2019\n\nAhead of their meeting at the United Nations General Assembly set for Wednesday, the Ukrainian president lightheartedly dismissed the controversy swirling over his phone call with Donald Trump. \u2026 \u201cNobody can put pressure on me because I am the president of an independent state. The only one person, by the way, who can put pressure on me\u2026is my son, who is 6 years old,\u201d he said, according to UNIAN. Another correspondent asked the Ukrainian president if he would ask Trump for anything during their first-ever meeting on Wednesday. \u201cWe can talk about support. Asking is definitely not about Ukraine. Ukraine is a new, strong country, asking nothing from anyone. We, ourselves, can help someone,\u201d Zelensky added.\n\nWell, what did people expect Zelensky to say \u2014 especially to Russian reporters? Yeah, I was totally intimidated by the American president. No world leader is going to claim to have been unduly pressured by another leader unless there\u2019s a clear national or personal benefit to it, and especially not when any sign of weakness invites the Bear Next Door to sniff out more weakness. That\u2019s not how you get out of office alive in Ukraine.\n\nSo even in the literal sense this is meaningless, except that the transcript of their call also suggests that Zelensky didn\u2019t feel threatened or intimidated, either. Both men spent considerable time praising each other, which is SOP for these kind of congratulatory calls, and also reminding each other what they can do for each other too. Trump\u2019s pursuit of personal hobby horses like Crowdstrike and the Bidens are discordant notes and worthy of criticism, but there\u2019s no hint of a threat or quid pro quo, and Zelensky brought up the Biden issue first in his mention of Rudy Giuliani. It would be strange indeed to have done that and later claim to have felt threatened by Trump\u2019s subsequent acceptance of Zelensky\u2019s offer of assistance.\n\nHowever, it doesn\u2019t actually matter in legal/political terms if Zelensky felt threatened by Trump. What matters is whether Trump abused his office and used US foreign aid as leverage to go after his political appointments, not whether it worked. Politically, this statement from Zelensky might dial down the heat a bit (although even that seems pretty optimistic), but it doesn\u2019t answer the allegation itself.\n\nThus far, the transcript certainly gives room for criticism of Trump and his focus on self-interest rather than national interest in this conversation, as Philip Klein rightly pointed out this morning, and that\u2019s a fair point to criticize. It\u2019s also a fair point to bring up in the next election, although Trump\u2019s relentless self-focus didn\u2019t do Trump too much harm the first time around. However, the transcript doesn\u2019t support the allegation of, and therefore not an impeachment for, abuse of power. Zelensky\u2019s input is interesting to consider, but it\u2019s not a game-changer. It\u2019s not much more than color commentary for the game.\n\nUpdate: Zelensky emphasized that the conversation was \u201cnormal\u201d in a joint press avail this afternoon at the UN:", "description": "\"Nobody can put pressure on me because I am the president of an independent state.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/zelenszkiy.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
