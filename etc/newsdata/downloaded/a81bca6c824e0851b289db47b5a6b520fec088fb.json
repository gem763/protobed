This would preclude them from coordinating Puigdemont\u2019s trial and the lack of civilian judges would necessitate a military tribunal.\n\nCatalonia has descended into widespread unrest following the conviction of nine separatist leaders from the region\u2019s failed 2017 independence bid, with a cumulative prison sentence of almost 100 years handed down.\n\nAlso on rt.com Flaming barricades & tensions: Unrest continues to grip Barcelona after Spain jails pro-independence Catalan leaders (VIDEOS)\n\nThere have been repeated scuffles and skirmishes on the streets, between pro-independence protesters and police, for four consecutive nights.
