Biden may be more loquacious, more comfortable talking to blue-collar and rural voters than Hillary, but he\u2019s low-energy on the trail and lacks what has become an essential trait: true star power.\n\nBarack Obama has it. Michelle Obama maybe even more. Trump? The Wall Street Journal just ran a story about the fanatical \u201cFront Row Joes\u201d \u2014 a significant portion one-time Obama supporters \u2014 traveling the country to faithfully attend Trump\u2019s rallies.\n\nSo what has the Democratic postmortem of 2016 generated? Another reheated, pre-packaged candidate of yesteryear, the \u201cmost electable\u201d despite, like Hillary, having already lost two presidential elections.\n\nThe referendum on Biden has been passed, yet we are told that now, really, is his time. Whether we like him or even want him is, quixotically, irrelevant.\n\nHis own wife said as much a few weeks ago.\n\n\u201cYour candidate might be better on, I don\u2019t know, health care than Joe is, but you\u2019ve got to look at who\u2019s going to win this election,\u201d Jill Biden said. \u201cAnd maybe you have to swallow a little bit and say, \u2018Okay, I personally like so-and-so better,\u2019 but your bottom line has to be that we have to beat Trump.\u201d\n\nAside from the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu \u2014 really, where is the logic in that statement?\n\nAnalysts and wonks can insist Biden is The One they all want, but we know it\u2019s early, and Elizabeth Warren is on a long-term upward trajectory. (A CBS/YouGov Tracker poll released Monday showed Biden\u2019s lead for convention delegates narrowing considerably, with Warren right behind.)\n\nAn aside: How can the party of progressives, in the #MeToo era, conceivably warn against fielding a female candidate this time around? Too much at stake, we\u2019re paternalistically told. The last female candidate lost. Let\u2019s try that again later, when the election isn\u2019t as important. Be satisfied with a VP nod.\n\nWarren has a freshness and momentum that Bernie Sanders, her closest competitor, lacks. Her followers are near-fanatical; in August, the New York Times reported that she may be the most popular Dem running, drawing fans by the thousands. Trump will call her \u201cPocahontas\u201d for her Native American debacle, but he can\u2019t bully her the way he did Hillary. There\u2019s no troublesome husband, no sleazy foundation exposed for self-dealing and favor-trading. Warren\u2019s unofficial slogan, \u201cI have a plan for that,\u201d underscores her readiness and reason for running.\n\nBiden, on the other hand, can\u2019t quite pull that together. Back in April, when asked why Democrats should choose him as the one to beat Trump, here\u2019s what he said: \u201cThat\u2019ll be for the Democrats to decide.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s low-energy on the trail and lacks what has become an essential trait: true star power.\n\nSeriously? Imagine if Trump uttered such a tautology. (Not to mention what similar incoherence did to Ted Kennedy in 1979.)\n\nFive months later, Biden still hasn\u2019t come up with a solid reason. When even the Times runs a story headlined \u201cDoes Joe Biden Want to Be Doing This?,\u201d as they did last week, one might reconsider demanding the nomination and promising victory.\n\n\u201cWe are in a battle for the soul of this country,\u201d Biden likes to say, but that sounds rather lofty when we all know what will decide 2020: the economy. \u201cStronger Together\u201d was Hillary\u2019s similarly esoteric slogan and premise in 2016, and we all know what decided that election: the economy.\n\nElizabeth Warren, love her or loathe her, has very definite ideas about the economy. She, unlike Biden, has called for the breakup of Big Tech. (He is \u201copen\u201d to it.) Her fight isn\u2019t for the soul of the country but for the middle class. All those things we\u2019re told make Biden inevitable \u2014 the hardscrabble childhood, the intellect, experience, stoicism and grit \u2014 Warren has in spades.\n\nThis Thursday, for the first time, voters will see Warren and Biden head to head in a primetime televised debate. If Biden\u2019s track record is any indication, there\u2019s every reason to expect Warren will dominate. In that case, Dems would do well to reconsider what \u201celectable\u201d looks like.", "description": "A Democratic front-runner whose nomination, we\u2019re told, is inevitable, whose decades of high-level experience in government and whose unflagging lead in the...", "authors": ["Maureen Callahan", "September"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/joe-biden-is-shaping-up-to-be-an-uninspiring-hillary-2.0.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
