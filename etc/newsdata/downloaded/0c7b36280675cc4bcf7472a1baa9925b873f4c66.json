At a synagogue in the city of Halle, Germany, 51 worshippers were assembled to observe the holiday.\n\nSuddenly, a gunman banged on the synagogue doors, firing several rounds into the lock, hoping to gain access to the building. He even lit an explosive and stuck it onto the door jamb. The man had already killed two people: one at a nearby restaurant, and another one directly outside the synagogue.\n\nBut somehow \u2014 improbably \u2014 the door held. Horrified worshippers held each other and prayed as they watched the events unfold on the synagogue\u2019s security cameras. The gunman eventually cursed in frustration and drove away.\n\nHis inability to open the door likely saved dozens of lives.\n\n\u201cWe were very, very, very afraid,\u201d Max Privorozky, the head of Halle\u2019s Jewish community, told CNN, adding that the building had \u201cgood doors\u201d that were \u201cbetter than weapons.\u201d\n\nPolice arrived about 10 minutes later and apprehended the suspected gunman. According to multiple news outlets, the heavily-armed gunman \u2014 allegedly Stephan Balliet \u2014 confessed and cited anti-Semitic and right-wing extremist motives for his actions. He live-streamed the attack. Authorities found explosives and ammunition in his vehicle.\n\n\u2022 Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

She described her ordeal on a public Facebook post.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made it out with our lives, in health and amazing spirits,\u201d she writes. \u201cFor whatever reason, the man with the gun was stalled or prohibited from entering the synagogue.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeveral hours later, with the threat of the gunman still at large, police units escorted us out of the synagogue and to a local hospital to check for signs of shock and trauma,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe are still here, trying to make sense of what happened and what is going on. Please know that we are safe.\u201d", "description": "Survivor of Attack on German Synagogue Speaks Out", "authors": ["Steve Helling"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/S4AwdIvhMQLtSDCGDiyNRw--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MjcwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/3d2474bc63f3c7f42f4f5ffb4e339d62", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
