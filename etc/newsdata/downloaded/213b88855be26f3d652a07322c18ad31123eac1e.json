Sydney hit a 77% clearance rate from 198 auctions, while Melbourne hit a 75% clearance rate from 495 auctions.\n\nAs an indication as to how different auction activity is this year compared to last, a summary for August 2019 shows in Sydney auction numbers were down 27% while in Melbourne they were down 15%.\n\nThis, along with increased search activity on realestate.com.au, has led to a big jump in clearance rates.\n\nWe continue to see solid signs of recovery in price growth in premium suburbs such as Vaucluse, Collaroy and Summer Hill.\n\nA strong imbalance between search and listings suggests that these price rises are going to spread to other parts of the market.\n\nSearch figures on realestate.com.au in Melbourne and Sydney are well and truly up, heavily influenced by the stimulus in the market.\n\nInterestingly, buyers in Brisbane, where search numbers are down, are not as active as those looking on Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast at the moment.\n\nWhile buyers are back in Sydney and Melbourne, it isn\u2019t being matched by seller activity. This is well down.\n\nIf you have a property and you want to sell \u2013 now is the time to list and make the most of the increase in buyer activity.", "description": "The most recent downturn in Sydney and Melbourne was never going to be the worst downturn ever recorded, despite all the hype.
