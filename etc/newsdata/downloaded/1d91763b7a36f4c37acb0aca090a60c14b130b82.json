Are YOU tough enough to stay?", "language": "en", "text": "When I wake up at 7am in my sumptuous room in the glorious Grantley Hall country house hotel in Yorkshire, it\u2019s tempting to remain in my kingsize bed.\n\nMy paper\u2019s been delivered, I\u2019m bolstered by a host of fat feather pillows (plus prop-up wedge purloined from the pillow menu), I have a sleek coffee machine and real milk and I\u2019ve raised the blackout blind via a wall switch.\n\nUnfortunately, however, I am not staying at this Relais & Ch\u00e2teaux hotel to lie around. I\u2019ve barely flung on my luxury velour robe (very comfortable: no need to trouble Housekeeping to fetch an anti-static, hypoallergenic bamboo alternative from the bathrobe menu) when there is a brisk \u2018rat-a-tat\u2019 at the door.\n\nWriter Anna Maxted went to stay at an exercise hotel in a Grade-II country mansion. Her luxurious stay included in-room exercising and jogging underwater\n\nShe also tried out the spinning at altitude class, where the rooms oxygen content is lowered to match that of a mountain. This is meant to raise heart rate and improve resistance\n\nDuncan Roy, 29, a transatlantic rowing champion and director of the hotel\u2019s cutting-edge gym and wellness facility, is standing there in sports gear next to a state-of-the-art rowing machine. He looks surprised to see me in a dressing gown. \u2018Don\u2019t worry,\u2019 I say, \u2018I\u2019m wearing my fitness kit underneath.\u2019\n\nDuncan wheels in the rowing machine and places it on the velvety carpet. In-room personal training is part of the five-star service \u2014 for those guests, who don\u2019t wish to work out in the gym \u2014 but there\u2019s also a far more important reason he\u2019s here: this is one of the first hotel rooms in Britain that is altitude-enabled.\n\nThis means the amount of oxygen in the air can be reduced \u2014 last night, Duncan set it at 1,800 m, \u2018higher than Ben Nevis\u2019. Before I crawled into those pristine white cotton sheets, I checked my heart rate and the amount of oxygen in my blood with the provided pulse oximeter (a little clip you stick on your finger).\n\nWhen I\u2019m tootling around at sea level, my heart rate is 58 beats per minute (bpm), and my SpO2 level (the degree of oxygen in my blood) is 99 per cent. This is within the normal range (95-100 per cent) and important because, when your oxygen level is low, the cells in your body may struggle to work properly.\n\nBut, when I woke, after a night of breathing thinner air, my heart rate was 68 bpm and my SpO2 level had dropped to 96 per cent. I felt a very mild shortness of breath, I tell Duncan, but I wasn\u2019t gasping. And I slept well. He\u2019s \u2018really chuffed\u2019 with my oxygen level \u2014 he didn\u2019t set the altitude at a \u2018crazy level\u2019, so as not to fatigue me.\n\nDespite all the exercise Anna never felt any aches and pains, however, due to the luxurious private yoga classes and massages that were also on offer\n\nThe hotel, which attracts athletes and exercise obsessed over 50s, is based at country mansion Grantley Hall, in Yorkshire\n\nThe point of all this? For athletes and amateur fitness fans alike, there are health benefits of sleeping and training at altitude, as your body metabolically adapts to less oxygen. That is, it improves to cope with the tougher conditions \u2014 meaning that when you come back down to earth, you\u2019re a little bit superhuman.\n\n\u2018Sleeping at altitude prompts the body to create rejuvenating red blood cells that carry oxygen to the muscles, which makes you more efficient at handling the oxygen,\u2019 says Duncan.\n\nMeanwhile, exercising at altitude \u2018gives you a muscular adaptation to the lack of oxygen\u2019. This boosts your fitness as your body becomes accustomed to operating on less oxygen, so, when you return to an environment packed with the stuff, both your speed and endurance improve.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s why Mo Farah, before the London Marathon, will be in Kenya on a nine-week training programme at 2,400m,\u2019 he adds.\n\nMy own training programme is less ambitious, but, for me, challenging enough. (My rowing is the first of three sessions before breakfast.) Duncan calls it \u2018a bit of a warm-up\u2019. He checks my blood oxygen levels again, then I\u2019m off.\n\nAnna also enjoyed some early morning jogs through the grounds of the picturesque estate\n\nHer bedroom was altitude enabled, which meant it could lower the oxygen level. She had it set to 1,800metres, or higher than the Ben Nevis peak\n\nI\u2019m soon curiously out of puff. I\u2019d obeyed Duncan\u2019s instructions to keep the bathroom door closed all night, to maintain the mountainous, atmospheric conditions, but to open it or a window if I didn\u2019t feel well. Yet the difference in oxygen wasn\u2019t noticeable \u2014 until now. I feel tired, even though this is fairly light exercise. It is harder to fill my lungs.\n\nTen minutes in, I\u2019m exhausted. I dream of buttered toast, a gentle float in the cloistered pool, a post-sauna chill in the \u2018snow room\u2019 (a little glass-fronted room inches deep in actual snow), perhaps a citrus essence facial in the spa. \u2018I want you to concentrate,\u2019 says Duncan. \u2018Let\u2019s go! Feel the energy! Big drive! Remember to breathe!\u2019\n\nFrankly, none of this is what one expects in a Grade II-listed stately home\n\n\u2018I\u2019m trying!\u2019\n\nThe final two minutes are torturous. I have rowed only a measly 1,000 m. \u2018Start feeling the benefits of this altitude air we\u2019re breathing in,\u2019 says Duncan. Currently, I feel none.\n\n\u2018You\u2019re working really hard \u2014 last ten seconds!\u2019 I can\u2019t respond. I\u2019m panting like an angry cat. My SpO2 level has dropped to 93 per cent. \u2018But, by the time you\u2019ve recovered and got your breath back,\u2019 says Duncan, \u2018we\u2019ll see that come back up.\u2019\n\nSure enough, we leave my room, skip down the spiral staircase and I\u2019m re-energised \u2014 fortunate, as my next appointments are EMS (electrical muscle stimulation) and a run on the underwater treadmill.\n\nThe luxurious room also contained a lounge with enough space for a rowing machine\n\nThe bathroom was a favourite place of retreat and had stunning views of the landscape\n\nBoth are excellent for rehabilitation and increasing strength if you have injuries, weaknesses or want to intensify training while minimising wear and tear, as there\u2019s little impact on joints.\n\nI perform squats and bicep curls while wired up to a machine that delivers electrical pulses, stimulating my muscles to contract and intensifying each movement by a factor of between nine and 18.\n\nTraining while being zapped is a relatively low-effort and strangely enjoyable way of supercharging your exercise.\n\nThen I jog in a small tank, which fills waist-high with lukewarm water.\n\nFrankly, none of this is what one expects in a Grade II-listed stately home, reopened as a country house hotel after an \u00a380 million renovation project. Sure, it befits your Downton Abbey for the 21st century to boast three restaurants (one headed by Michelin-starred chef Shaun Rankin) and glorious grounds complete with helipad.\n\nAnd certainly, after a wander in the fresh air \u2014 Wellingtons provided \u2014 and \u2018a full Yorkshire\u2019, boozy lunch, tea and cake in the cosy drawing room and cocktails in the bar prior to a chomp through the exquisite eight-course tasting menu at dinner, you might consider breaking a mild sweat in the gym.\n\nThe tank that she is jogging in has been filled waist-high with lukewarm water. Trainers at the hotel include a former transatlantic rowing champion and regimental sergeant major\n\nThe high-altitude spinning class, with low oxygen, aims to get participants fitter faster\n\nBut the service offered here for serious athletes, and middle-aged exercisers like me keen to fine-tune their wellness regimen, is exceptional. Olympic athletes Daley Thompson and Sebastian Coe are fans, having stayed at Grantley Hall for its grand opening this July.\n\nThe hotel is also attracting guests who hit 50 and, after years of relative sloth, become fitness-obsessed. (It seems we middle-class exercisers want to sweat in state-of-the-art luxury, log every wellness stat and personal best and be precision-coached by elite experts.)\n\nWhen the UCI Road World Championships, a week-long cycling world championship, took place in Yorkshire last month, an influx of middle-aged amateur cyclists converged on the hotel.\n\nAfter my underwater run, I\u2019m hankering after a fancy afternoon tea, but instead, Duncan whisks me off to the gym.\n\nHere, a machine analyses my body composition and biometrics. I\u2019m 50 and, to my crowing glee, it assesses my metabolic age as 35. I\u2019m a healthy weight, with a good amount of muscle and low visceral fat (the bad sort stored around internal organs), but my overall fat percentage, 21.8, is lower than desirable (23 to 33.9 per cent is ideal). It\u2019s valuable information, as my hair\u2019s been falling out at an alarming rate \u2014 and this could be why.\n\nA bathroom within the hotel. Anna said that, 'It seems we middle-class exercisers want to sweat in state-of-the-art luxury, log every wellness stat and personal best and be precision-coached by elite experts'\n\nAnother luxurious bathroom at the sumptuous hotel in Yorkshire, near\n\nPrior to my visit, Duncan also arranged a FaceTime consultation with nutritionist Sian Baker. I\u2019d grumbled about my hair. Sian suspects my habit of not eating until 11am, a form of intermittent fasting, is stressing my body.\n\nShe\u2019s recommended menu choices at Grantley, suited to my \u2018goals and aspirations\u2019 (one of which is not to go bald).\n\nFor lunch, I choose poached salmon, high in protein, followed by spiced ginger cake, lots of carbs. Sian reckons that, with all the exercise, I\u2019ll need the energy. As if to prove the point, I\u2019m packed off to a spinning at altitude class, in the altitude-enabled studio. My SpO2 level is noted, then master trainer Anoushka Moore adjusts the high-tech bike so I\u2019m comfortable (all things being relative).\n\nToday\u2019s training is colour- coded \u2014 the mini-screen above my handlebars changes from white to blue, green, yellow and red, according to effort, speed, resistance and energy expended.\n\nI\u2019m assigned to a team and all my stats are visible on the wall. Oh, hooray.\n\nSo, apart from stimulating red blood cell production, remind me why I\u2019m masochistically spinning at altitude? (It\u2019s set at 1,800 m, \u2018a good entry level\u2019 declares Duncan.) Essentially, says Anoushka, it will boost my high-intensity work rate, my performance at endurance sport, and resistance training. \u2018It offers a potent stimulus for adaptation. In short, it gets us fitter faster.\u2019 The class is exhilarating \u2014 though, despite the distractions of music, scenery and the challenges of remaining green or ascending to yellow, there are moments I fear my heart might go \u2018splat\u2019.\n\nThough I cycle 24.32 km, my numbers (faithfully recorded, as with every endeavour here) reveal I spend 18.58 minutes languishing in the \u2018white zone\u2019 \u2014 and a piffling two minutes in the red. I blame the thin air. Anoushka insists I \u2018smashed it\u2019.\n\nTruth is, I might have quit, but Duncan had prepared me for battle. He\u2019d set up a pre-visit session with Lee Evans, of Mind Power Solutions, a specialist in mental resilience training.\n\nLee, a former regimental sergeant major in the Army\u2019s 24 Commando Engineer Regiment, told me: \u2018So many people chuck themselves into work and everything else falls apart. I work with people to sustain high performance in their lives, while keeping their relationships strong, and maintaining their health.\u2019\n\nAfter an intense hour with Lee, I resolved to use \u2018self-talk\u2019 to increase self-awareness and intent, rather than doubt and take responsibility for my feelings.\n\nAnd if that situation is difficult? \u2018Have the courage to honour the struggle. Realise: \u201cI\u2019m going to learn from it, because I\u2019m developing.\u201d Don\u2019t be a moaner or complainer. That\u2019s not honouring the struggle. That\u2019s sucking the life out of everyone!\u2019\n\nBefore lunch the next day, I have a PT session, tailored to my lower back issues. After checking for muscular imbalances, Scott coaches me in single and double leg hip thrusts \u2014 great for the glutes, apparently \u2014 and squats, which improve core stability.\n\nRehabilitation expert Paul Martin joins us to advise. I feel like a rusty vintage car being restored by skilled mechanics.\n\nEven my three-minute session in the cryotherapy chamber, which drops as low as minus 85c, is bearable, as Duncan amuses me by playing Ice Ice Baby.\n\nThis treatment stops any post-exercise inflammation and burns up to 800 calories, he says. Readings show my skin temperature drops more than 10c, enhancing the benefits. It gives new meaning to \u2018freezing your butt off\u2019!\n\nHappily, the pampering is as spectacular as the fitness. From a private yoga session on the helipad, to deep tissue massages, the attention to recovery means I don\u2019t feel an ache or a twinge.\n\nI leave Grantley Hall on a high \u2014 and not just because of the altitude training.", "description": "Anna Maxted stayed at the fitness crazed hotel in Grantley Hall, Yorkshire.
