The remaining group went from an average of $43,897 to $43,057, remaining similar wages.\n\nResearchers found that those whose salary rose lowered their risk of cardiovascular disease by 14 percent.\n\nThis is mainly because of a lower risk of heart failure, according to Wang, who was a master's of public health student at Harvard at the time of the study.\n\nBut participants whose income dropped had a 17 percent higher risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\nThat's because these adults were at a greater risk of suffering a heart attack or a stroke.\n\nWang says there are several other mechanisms that could put someone whose had a a pay cut at risk for cardiovascular disease\n\n'It could induce changes in health behavior. Studies have shown people with financial stress are more likely to eat calorically-dense food, which is cheap,' he said.\n\n'There's a link between CVD and alcohol and cigarette use, and an increase in stress and depression, seen in CVD risk.'\n\nThe team says one of the limitations of its study is that participants who developed health issues may have been more likely to experience a salary cut.\n\nWang hopes that both doctors and the general public are aware of the risk financial circumstances could have on heart disease.\n\n'There's social factors that are a significant part of someone's risk for cardiovascular disease,' he said.\n\n'It's subject that's not been very talked about in medicine. We focus on medical devices and medication. In the future, we should focus on both.'", "description": "A new study from Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, found that the risk of strokes and heart attacks rose nearly 20 percent for those whose salary decreased.", "authors": ["Mary Kekatos Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com", "Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/15/19495008-0-image-a-3_1570631105664.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
