Locally (and appropriately) known as SLO, the city basks in its location.\n\nWhich is perfectly understandable. Compact, walkable SLO is halfway between San Francisco and LA, less than 10 miles from the nearest coast, at quirky Pismo Beach, and filled with cute galleries, cocktail joints and innovative restaurants that make the most of the area\u2019s abundant produce. And did we mention the wineries?\n\nIt\u2019s long been a popular stop along the classic Pacific Coast Highway road trip and a whispered secret among regular weekenders. But its popularity is growing, with new hotels moving in to meet demand \u2013 Hotel SLO, with two restaurants, a spa and gardens, is downtown\u2019s biggest property since it opened in August 2019, while Hotel Cerro, from the team behind Richard Branson\u2019s Necker Island, followed in September.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nWhat to do\n\nHang out at the farmers\u2019 market\n\nThe year-round Thursday night Farmers\u2019 Market is more like a party, with a stretch of Higuera Street overtaken by street food vendors, stalls selling local honey and avocados, and musicians, from local crooners to brass quintets.\n\nThis bustling outdoor event is free, but take some cash for spiced elote (Mexican-style corn on the cob) and sizzling BBQ tri-tip beef sandwiches.\n\nSip your way through the Edna Valley\n\nThe town is surrounded by invitingly striped hillsides, which means one, brilliant thing: wine. The Edna Valley AVA has around 30 wineries. Let someone else do the driving on a guided tour: Breakaway Tours runs small-group day trips for $119, visiting four wineries with a picnic lunch included.\n\nThe Edna Valley is especially known for pinot noir and crisp, mineral-forward white wines, though it also has a burgeoning ros\u00e9 scene. Sip unusual pinks made from Mourvedre and Grenache at Malene, where tastings are poured in a super-cute vintage Airstream trailer.\n\nSUP with sea otters\n\nThere are several pretty, off-beat beach towns a short drive from SLO, and Morro Bay is one of the best for wildlife spotting. It\u2019s home to a distinctive volcanic rock peak, stretches of honey-hued sand, and adorably laid-back sea otters.\n\nThey\u2019re easy to spot around the harbour, floating on their backs and sometimes cuddling pups to their bellies. And you can get even closer on a stand-up paddle board. Join a two-hour Nature Tour with SUP Morro Bay, paddling around the estuary and sand spit, for $25.\n\nTake a photo in Bubblegum Alley\n\nEither side of this 70ft-long alleyway is decorated with masticated, multi-coloured balls of gum. Find it between Garden and Broad just off Higuera Street. It\u2019s a little disgusting if you chew over it for too long, but makes for a fun snap.\n\nEat cake in a pink palace\n\nA riot of pink and Flintstones-esque architecture, the Madonna Inn may not be to everyone\u2019s taste. But this iconic hotel, just on the edge of downtown SLO, is too kitsch to ignore. Celebrities who\u2019ve stayed in the eye-popping themed rooms range from Debbie Harry to Kim Kardashian, but you can just swing by for a whopping wedge of cake in the Copper Cafe. Do use the facilities \u2013 the ladies\u2019 loo is blazingly pink and red, while the men\u2019s comes complete with boulders and a waterfall.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nThere are several big chains off the Highway 101, but stay downtown to experience the best of the city\u2019s food and nightlife scene.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t get more heart-of-the-action than SLO Brew Lofts, which has five generously sized suites (more like apartments, really) tucked above the SLO Brew pub, popular for live music. The Castaway, with four-poster bed and a separate lounge/kitchen area is cosy for couples, while the three-bed Voyager, complete with private roof terrace, is perfect for groups. All have record players, cocktail kits, and fridges crammed with the craft beers and surprisingly delicious tinned wine produced just downstairs. Doubles from \u00a3275, room only.\n\nThe Kinney SLO is close to Cal Poly university, whose Performing Arts Center often hosts concerts. Colourful rooms \u2013 plastered with posters and art \u2013 communal areas with games and sofas, and a sociable outdoor pool complement the college vibe. Doubles from \u00a370, room only.\n\nThe Butler Hotel is a quieter option that\u2019s still walkable from downtown attractions. Each of the six rooms has custom-made furniture, local artwork and cosy touches like waffle robes and pillow-top beds. Doubles from \u00a3180, room only.\n\nWhere to eat\n\nSLO was doing slow food before it became a thing. Dinner crawls are a popular way to experience several restaurants in one night (with so many great places, it makes perfect sense).\n\nYou could begin with a cheeseboard and maybe some balsamic glazed brussels sprouts at hip Granada Bistro, perch at Luna Red\u2019s twinkly outdoor bar for some zingy tacos, and head to late-opening Batch for ice-cream cookies.\n\nYou might want to linger a little longer at the Vegetable Butcher, though. Veggies are the star of the menu, showcased in sharing dishes like Mexican mole street corn, shot through with notes of smoke and chocolate, steak with kale chimichurri sauce, and the ridiculously pretty spring vegetable shishito, with gossamer-thin tempura batter and edible petals.\n\nOr taste one of the area\u2019s specialities: Santa Maria\u2013style BBQ, the star of which is tender beef tri-tip grilled slowly over oak. Try it at Old San Luis BBQ, which serves its soft, well-seasoned meat in a no-frills spot with a range of Central Coast craft brews.\n\nPrepare your tastebuds \u2013 and eyes \u2013 before entering Doc Burnstein\u2019s Ice Cream Lab. It\u2019s a flourish of fanciful colours and flavours from birthday cake to merlot raspberry truffle, made with wine.\n\nWhere to drink\n\nTaste a variety of vintages from Edna Valley and nearby Paso Robles at snug Luis Wine Bar, with monthly rotating wine flights and a creekside patio.\n\nThe Station SLO, a sleek bar in a converted garage, goes against the grape by specialising in European wines.\n\nCraft beer here is as varied and terroir-driven as the wine. Seek out Central Coast Brewing to sip unusual infusions like chai lager and hear live music surrounded by fermentation tanks.\n\nSour fans will adore Libertine, which specialises in lip-smackingly tart ales fermented with wild yeast and sharp fruits.\n\nOr try Cider Bar, with around two-dozen taps to choose from and an indoor/outdoor seating area.\n\nFinish an evening at Nightcap, the latest addition to the Granada Hotel and Bistro. Bartenders at this tucked-away cocktail lounge shake, stir and swizzle drinks like the Gilded Lily, a potent concoction of vodka, gin, vermouth and St-Germain.\n\nWhere to shop\n\nDowntown\u2019s shopping scene is a mix of high street names, indie boutiques, vintage shops and stores selling local artisan crafts. Monterey Street has a stretch of cool one-off shops including JunkGirls, with cute home decor items, art and jewellery made with recycled materials. Nearby Boo Boo Records has racks of new and used vinyl and buttery soft T-shirts featuring its rooster logo. The store also hosts intimate gigs.\n\nWhen in California, check out the surf shops. Small regional chain Moondoggies Beach Club has a store here, filled with all the artfully faded hoodies and baseball caps you could ever need.\n\nCynically (but perhaps accurately) named Just Looking Gallery has a selection of pieces by local artists. Check out the vintage-style travel posters featuring Central Coast landmarks \u2013 you might actually be tempted to buy.\n\nArchitectural highlight\n\nThe 18th-century Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa, one of 21 Spanish missions dotted along California\u2019s coast, looms elegantly above the banks of San Luis Creek, just on the edge of downtown. The porticoed, bright-white building has a small museum and daily docent-led tours, both free.\n\nNuts and bolts\n\nWhat currency do I need?\n\nUS dollars (USD).\n\nWhat language do they speak?\n\nEnglish.\n\nShould I tip?\n\nAround 18-20 per cent is standard in restaurants and $1 per drink in bars. For tour guides, $5-10 is expected.\n\nWhat\u2019s the time difference?\n\nEight hours behind the UK.\n\nWhat\u2019s the average flight time from the UK?\n\nAround 11 hours to LAX, plus around a 3.5-hour drive or one-hour connecting flight to San Luis Obispo.\n\nTransport\n\nDowntown SLO is very walkable, though a rental car is handy for exploring the nearby attractions and beaches.\n\nBest view\n\nHike the dirt paths that spiral to the top of Madonna Mountain for views over the city to a string of volcanic peaks known as the \u201cNine Sisters\u201d.\n\nInsider tip\n\nCatch one of the free Concerts in the Plaza, every Friday evening from mid-June to mid-September in Mission Plaza.", "description": "San Luis Obispo, surrounded by wineries, volcanic mountain peaks and pale, velvety hills on California\u2019s Central Coast, likes to take things nice and easy.
