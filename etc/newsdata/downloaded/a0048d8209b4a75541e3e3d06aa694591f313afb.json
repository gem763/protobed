Seth Moulton (D-MA) wrote in a letter to Tufts in 2018.\n\nOver the past two years, more than 20 American colleges and universities have ended their relationships with the Confucius Institute over bipartisan concern that China was using the organization to exert control on American higher education. For example, Breitbart News reported in September 2018 that the University of North Florida had cut ties with the Confucius Institute.\n\nTufts University claims that the Confucius Institute has not attempted to censor or suppress speech during its tenure on campus. In fact, administrators claim that the Confucius Institute has provided unique resources and opportunities for students.\n\nJames Glaser, Tufts\u2019 dean of the School of Arts and Sciences, said that the \u201cwell-researched\u201d decision to renew their contract with the Confucius Institute was made so that students will continue to have access the institute\u2019s resources, namely Chinese-language and culture courses. \u201cI\u2019m confident that we have arrived at a very thoughtful and well-researched decision,\u201d Glaser said. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased that our students will continue to have access to a resource that helps them enhance their language skills and their understanding of Chinese culture. In addition to the enhanced oversight our new agreement establishes, we also will be establishing a committee of Tufts faculty to weigh in on the qualifications of proposed Chinese staff and the CITU\u2019s activities in general to ensure that they align with our policies and priorities.\u201d\n\nStay tuned to Breitbart News for more updates on this story.", "description": "Tufts University announced this week that it will maintain its partnership with the Confucius Institute, a controversial organization backed by the Chinese government.", "authors": ["Tom Ciccotta"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/07/Chinese-flag-barbed-wire-housing-compound-Xinjiang-China-Uighur-Getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
