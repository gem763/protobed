I think I played really well today. I just like to finish the year this way. Especially after making the final last week, I was much more confident in coming to this tournament.\u201d", "description": "Former French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko proved too strong for defending champion Julia Goerges in the Luxembourg Open final as she cruised past the German 6-4 6-1 on Sunday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191020&t=2&i=1443056820&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9J0K4-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
