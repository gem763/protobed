On Aug. 7, 1981, the words \u201cFINAL EDITION\u201d blared from above the paper\u2019s nameplate. It really was.\n\nThe life of the paper is recounted in \u201cThe Evening Star: The Rise and Fall of a Great Washington Newspaper,\u201d a new book by Faye Haskins, a former archivist and photo librarian in the D.C. Public Library\u2019s Washingtoniana division.\n\nAD\n\nHaskins came to the District in 1971. She admits that over the next decade, she had little interaction with the Star.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI was always a Post subscriber,\u201d she said.\n\nThat made Haskins a blank piece of paper when it came to the Star.\n\n\u201cHaving never known about it, it was surprising to me to learn it was such an important paper and had such significance in the city\u2019s history,\u201d she said. \u201cIts history got buried because it did have a slow decline. Its heyday was in a much earlier time.\u201d\n\nThe Star was founded in 1852 by a printer named Joseph Borrows Tate. It passed through several owners before being sold in 1867 to a group that included Crosby Noyes and Samuel Kauffmann. Kauffmann handled the business side of the paper while Noyes, the Star\u2019s star reporter, oversaw the newsroom.\n\nAD\n\nNoyes was one of those driven, self-made figures that the 19th century seemed to conjure up regularly. He was an illegitimate son from Maine who gladly left the cold winters of that state in 1848 when a publisher there told him if he moved to Washington, he\u2019d pay him $1 for every story he sent back.\n\nAD\n\nBy 1855, Noyes was working at the Star. He covered the 1859 hanging of abolitionist John Brown, ending his dispatch with the words \u201c[The] body swung perpendicular, turning slowly round and round \u2026 with the fluttering of the coat shirts in the breeze, giving it singularly the appearance of a cornfield scarecrow.\u201d\n\nFor the next century, members of the Noyes and Kauffmann families ran the Star and were active in the commercial, political and philanthropic life of the District.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAs Katharine Graham said, they were on every board of every bank and business in the city,\u201d said Haskins, who now lives outside Austin. \u201cThe Star was known for being a good local paper. It really covered local news, from politics to culture.\u201d\n\nBy the time of the paper\u2019s 1952 centenary, \u201cThey really were on the top of the world,\u201d Haskins said. Two years later, The Post bought the Washington Times-Herald, in an instant leapfrogging the Evening Star, an afternoon paper.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey were not aggressive enough,\u201d Haskins said of the Star\u2019s managers. \u201cThey became really stale, not so much in the newspaper, but in the business decisions.\u201d\n\nEven in decline, the Star earned the loyalty of its employees, people like columnist Mary McGrory.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cShe absolutely loved the paper,\u201d Haskins said. \u201cShe came there as a book reviewer. Then Newby Noyes, the national editor, asked her to go to the Joe McCarthy hearings. She became famous because she did these really astute observations of the man, naming him as a bully.\u201d\n\nThe Star, Haskins said, \u201cwas a conservative paper editorially, but they didn\u2019t mess with their reporters.\u201d\n\nAmong those journalists were some who went on to work at The Post and elsewhere, including David Broder, Diana McLellan and Howard Kurtz.\n\nIn 1974, Joseph Allbritton bought the Star. He sold it four years later, concerned FCC rules wouldn\u2019t allow him to own the paper and his TV station, WJLA. New owner Time Inc. seemed not to know what to do with a daily newspaper. When the Star folded, readers mourned.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPeople were worried that the [U.S.] capital was a one-paper town,\u201d Haskins said. \u201cThat\u2019s what a lot of people complained about. Even if they weren\u2019t strong [Star] supporters, they thought there was a need for another voice, a viewpoint that was different. The more voices you have, the better.\u201d\n\nOf course, today many communities would love to have even a single newspaper.\n\nFaye Haskins will be speaking about her book at 1 p.m. Nov. 9, in the Peabody Room at the Georgetown Public Library; 6 p.m. Nov. 14, at the Historical Society of Washington in the Carnegie Library; and noon Nov. 25, at the D.C. History Conference at the University of the District of Columbia.\n\nFor previous columns, visit washingtonpost.com/john-kelly.\n\nAD", "description": "A new book says in a town full of newspapers, the Evening Star once stood above the rest.", "authors": ["John Kelly", "Local Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/HDgaeG4yYLzJzl51U3X5UWsgL9g=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GUFHC5XQF4I6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
