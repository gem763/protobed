(Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post)\n\nA maintenance project scheduled to keep part of Maryland\u2019s Chesapeake Bay Bridge closed for most of the next two years has created what many motorists and residents say is unprecedented traffic misery on both sides of the bay.\n\nAutumn backups are rivaling those typically seen on the busiest summer beach weekends. Eastbound backups one recent Friday stretched for 14 miles, snarling traffic across a large swath of Anne Arundel County for 10 hours.\n\nIn Queen Anne\u2019s County, where the bridge touches down on the Eastern Shore, traffic headed west on a recent Sunday evening stacked up for almost nine miles. The area now sees Monday morning backups that motorists say have added up to 45 minutes to already lengthy commutes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a mess,\u201d said Jeff Straight, spokesman for Queen Anne\u2019s County Public Schools.\n\nSome of the school system\u2019s buses are regularly delayed up to 20 minutes, he said. Some special needs students who cross the bridge to attend schools in Annapolis and Baltimore have gotten stuck on buses for up to two hours.\n\n\u201cThe idea of this going on for two years is kind of sobering,\u201d Straight said.\n\nWith about 40,000 vehicles crossing daily, the impacts of closing one lane of the westbound span to replace the bridge deck have rippled far beyond the crossing. Area residents say Waze and other navigation apps have spread the problem by rerouting motorists onto local roads that quickly become swamped.\n\nThe Maryland Transportation Authority, which operates the bridge, declined to make anyone available for an interview.\n\nIn an emailed statement, spokeswoman Kelly Melhem said the $27 million project is \u201ccritical\u201d to preserve the four-mile bridge, and the transportation authority is asking for \u201cpatience and understanding during these necessary safety repairs.\u201d\n\nMelhem said the authority has \u201cconsistently warned motorists to expect major delays with this project,\u201d adding that 600 seats remain free on state commuter buses between Kent Island, Baltimore and Washington.\n\n\n\nCommuters wait outside toll booths to cross the bridge on Oct. 10. (Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post)\n\nTo keep traffic moving, she said, the agency has recently implemented cashless tolls on Thursday and Friday afternoons and evenings and resumed temporary two-way operations on the westbound span to clear \u201csevere\u201d eastbound backups when necessary.\n\nMelhem said the authority is working with local school systems, public safety officials and employers to try to reduce the traffic impacts.\n\nBut local officials say the state gave them little warning about the severity of the impacts and has ignored their ideas for how to reduce delays.\n\nQueen Anne\u2019s County Commissioner James J. Moran (R) said he\u2019s heard \u201ccrickets\u201d from the authority.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get a response,\u201d Moran said at a recent board meeting. \u201c. . . We\u2019re in the dark.\u201d\n\nAnne Arundel County Executive Steuart Pittman (D) questioned why the authority didn\u2019t implement all-electronic tolling at the bridge before beginning the work and hasn\u2019t tried adjusting tolls as a financial incentive to travel off-peak.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been frustrating for us as a county,\u201d Pittman said. \u201cWe can\u2019t seem to get much of a conversation going about how we can improve the situation.\u201d\n\nUnder a public grilling from Comptroller Peter Franchot (D), state Transportation Secretary Pete K. Rahn apologized for the 14-mile backup in the Annapolis area on Sept. 27. Rahn said the authority \u201cdid not have a response already in an advance plan\u201d for what he called unanticipated traffic due to unseasonably warm fall beach weather.\n\n[Maryland transportation chief apologizes for hours-long Bay Bridge backup]\n\nFranchot has since called on the authority to suspend the project for the fall and winter, until the state works with local officials to better reduce the traffic fallout. The authority has said doing so would make backups worse by pushing work into the busier spring and summer months.\n\nMoran and other public officials say they\u2019ve heard from residents so worn out from increasingly unpredictable bridge commutes that they\u2019ve quit jobs or planned to move closer to them. State government agencies and some local employers have begun to offer condensed workweeks and encourage Eastern Shore employees to work from home.\n\nBusinesses near the bridge say backups are keeping customers away, as local residents try to stay out of the spillover traffic and motorists heading to and from the Eastern Shore remain in the queues.\n\n\n\nConstruction on the bridge has closed one of the westbound lanes. (Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post)\n\nSarah Maldonado said she passed nine-mile backups on westbound Route 50 and adjacent Main Street as she headed in the opposite direction to work on a recent Sunday. She said business that evening at Fisherman\u2019s Inn, a restaurant in Grasonville where she\u2019s the manager, was off by almost 25 percent.\n\n\u201cUsually [returning] beach traffic backs up, but it moves,\u201d Maldonado said. \u201cIt might be crawling, but it moves. This wasn\u2019t moving. \u2026 It was literally the worst I\u2019ve ever seen it.\u201d\n\nWorkers who live five miles away spent an hour getting to the restaurant, she said.\n\n\u201cEvery time the phone rang,\u201d Maldonado said, \u201cwe knew it was another employee saying they were stuck in traffic.\u201d\n\nThe problems started in late September, when the authority closed the right lane on the westbound span for the repairs. The state also narrowed westbound Route 50 to two lanes nearly two miles before the bridge, pushing the bottleneck further back.\n\nThat left two, rather than three, westbound lanes for weekday commuters and Sunday evening drivers returning from the shore.\n\nThe closure also affected eastbound traffic because the westbound span previously was converted to two-way traffic at peak times, giving eastbound drivers an additional lane. That particularly helped on Thursday and Friday evenings, when Eastern Shore visitors join commuters.\n\nThe longest eastbound backup came on the first Friday after that traffic was limited to its own span. The delays prompted the authority to take the rare step of lifting tolls for several hours until traffic cleared after 11 p.m.\n\n[Study: A new span close to Bay Bridge would provide most traffic relief]\n\n\n\nThe bridge, seen from Sandy Point State Park in Anne Arundel County. (Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post)\n\nAnne Arundel County Council member Amanda Fiedler (R) said backups in areas near the bridge were the worst she\u2019d seen in 40 years.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever anticipated a scenario like that,\u201d Fiedler said. \u201cIt was gridlock \u2014 and \u2018gridlock\u2019 is an understatement.\u201d\n\nTo try to prevent a reoccurrence, the state implemented cashless tolls from noon to 10 p.m. on Thursdays and Fridays so motorists don\u2019t have to stop at the toll booths. Those without an E-ZPass are billed the $4 cash toll by mail without the usual additional fee.\n\nThe state also resumed temporary two-way operations on the westbound span when needed to clear severe eastbound backups.\n\nBoth changes have helped ease eastbound traffic, motorists and public officials say. However, they say, the occasional two-way operations have made westbound traffic worse because it leaves those motorists a single lane that quickly backs up into Queen Anne\u2019s just as schools and workplaces let out.\n\nBecause the westbound span\u2019s two lanes have been narrowed, the authority has prohibited trucks and other large vehicles from using it in either direction during two-way operations. That has left them parked on the eastern side of the bridge for several hours at a time.\n\n[Maps of sites for an additional bay crossing rile Md. residents]\n\n\n\nA traffic jam ahead of the bridge. (Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post)\n\nRegular bridge commuters say they hope traffic improves as temperatures fall and fewer tourists join the fray.\n\nDelaware resident Sharell Henley, who drives to the Washington region for sales appointments, said she recently enrolled her 8-year-old daughter in a $77 per week child-care program because she can no longer guarantee when she\u2019ll get home.\n\nHenley said she is also trying to telework more and has begun leaving home by 3:30 a.m. to ensure she\u2019s on time to 8 a.m. appointments.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not leaving it to chance anymore,\u201d Henley said one recent morning while filling her gas tank a few miles east of the bridge.\n\nMatt Nagel said the project has lengthened his days hauling sand and stone from the Eastern Shore to concrete plants and construction sites on the other side of the bay.\n\nNagel, who makes two round-trips over the bridge daily, said eastbound Friday backups that used to start in the late afternoon are now underway by lunchtime. On a recent Monday morning, he said, he got stuck for 45 minutes trying to head west.\n\n\u201cWe work 10- to 12-hour days anyway,\u201d Nagel said recently as he stopped at a McDonald\u2019s on Route 50 in Stevensville. \u201cSo any delay isn\u2019t good.\u201d\n\nSome traffic watchers questioned why the state started the project in late September, when beach temperatures and large weekend events still draw crowds.\n\nMelanie Pursel, president of the Greater Ocean City Chamber of Commerce, said businesses are worried the delays will scare off the fall and spring visitors that Eastern Shore communities have worked for years to attract.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s just kind of stunned everyone, how bad the backups are,\u201d Pursel said. \u201cWe all knew it would be an inconvenience, but this is pretty dramatic.\u201d", "description": "Md. officials say they\u2019re working to reduce delays, but local leaders say their ideas are ignored.", "authors": ["Katherine Shaver", "Reporter Covering Urban Planning", "Transportation Issues", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/t_7RReoW_8Te-TjQExH5mgzy2lo=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MGBRO2HLWUI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
