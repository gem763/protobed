The counties affected by the outages are: Alpine, Amador, Butte, Calaveras, El Dorado, Kern, Lake, Mendocino, Napa, Nevada, Placer, Plumas, San Mateo, Sierra, Sonoma, Tehama and Yuba counties.\n\nThe shutoffs will begin at about 2 p.m. in the Sierra Foothills region, 3 p.m. in North Bay counties, 1 a.m. Thursday in San Mateo and Kern counties.\n\nWeather forecasts show that peak wind speeds will end at about noon Thursday in North Bay, San Mateo County and the Sierra Foothills, with peak wind periods expected to end at about noon Friday in Kern County.\n\nPower will only be restored to the areas once PG&E has a chance to inspect the de-energized power lines once the high winds subside, according to a company press release.\n\nAccording to the utility company, power will be safely restored \u201cin stages as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nPG&E expects to have power restored for the majority of customers within 48 hours after the hot, dry and windy weather has passed.\n\nFinancially speaking, the preventative power outages will cost the utility company an estimated $2 billion, which includes both commercial and residential customer impact, according to estimates by Michael Wara of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment.\n\nPG&E filed bankruptcy in January after announcing it was facing more than $30 billion in liabilities because its power lines\u2019 helped ignite the deadly Camp Fire in Butte County, California, last year. The fires killed 85 people led to $16.5 billion in damages.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "PG&E are deliberately cutting power to 17 California counties to avoid the catastrophic wildfires that left 85 dead in last year's Camp Fire.", "authors": ["Matthew Mcnulty"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/PGE-iStock.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
