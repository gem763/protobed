It has been retweeted more than 120,000 times.\n\nThe game - which sees up to 100 competitors battle to be the last player standing - is broken up into seasons which last several months, with the start of each new season marked by in-game events.\n\nThis latest showpiece coincides with the end of the game's 10th season - with many now expecting a large-scale refresh of the game and its island setting before it returns for the 11th season, likely to begin in the coming days.\n\nPrevious large Fortnite events have included a meteor shower, a rocket launch, and a fight between a giant robot and a monster taking place across the map earlier this year.\n\nSince its initial release in 2017, Fortnite has become one of the world's most popular video games.\n\nthe free-to-play game has attracted more than 100 million players and seen its in-game dance moves replicated by a number of athletes during major global events, including the 2018 Fifa World Cup.\n\nThe game held its own inaugural World Cup Finals earlier this year, where more than 100 players competed for a total prize pot of \u00a324 million.", "description": "Fortnite has disappeared and been replaced with a black hole \u2013 and it is a mystery what happens next.
