I'd never seen a two-metres tall player before', he told The Athletic.\n\n'He played for Liverpool and we played them in a cup game at Anfield. I was thinking \"Wow, what can I do today with this guy?\"\n\n'Then I saw Bellamy next to him, not a great player on the ball but very, very fast. He would run into space, Crouch would jump into the air. I'd never seen football played like this.\n\nVidic was left for dead by Fernando Torres in March 2009, a 4-1 defeat where he was sent off\n\nVidic had praised for Chelsea striker Didier Drogba, who he met on a number of occasions\n\nVidic claimed Manchester United's 4-1 defeat at rivals City in 2013 was his worst game\n\n'I'd never had a No 9 and a sharp, fast, player next to him. I knew how to deal with them individually but not both of them at the same time. I played alongside Wes Brown, it was a tough game, a long game. We lost 1-0.'\n\nVidic also praised the other three forwards on his list, Didier Drogba, Sergio Aguero and Luis Suarez.\n\nHe called Chelsea legend Drogba a 'very clever player who would get into the brain of the defenders.'\n\nVidic adds when talking about Aguero, that the 4-1 defeat at Manchester City in 2013 was his worst game for United.\n\nFor Suarez, he pinpointed his 'instinct' and energy for getting the better of his opponents.", "description": "In eight trophy-laden years at Manchester United, Nemanja Vidic came across his fair share of bruising centre-forwards.", "authors": ["James Dutton For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/11/19623704-0-image-a-23_1570877821269.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
