While the pop star has processed her breakup in the public eye, Hemsworth has laid relatively low and kept close to family in his native Australia.\n\nIn August, the \u201cHunger Games\u201d alum broke his silence on the divorce, sending nothing but love Cyrus\u2019 way.\n\n\u201cHi all Just a quick note to say that Miley and I have recently separated and I wish her nothing but health and happiness going forward,\u201d he wrote on Instagram. \u201cThis is a private matter and I have not made, nor will I be making, any comments to any journalists or media outlets. Any reported quotes attributed to me are false. Peace and Love.\u201d\n\nHemsworth and Brown\u2019s love connection arrives shortly after Cyrus began dating her new beau Cody Simpson, having pressed pause on her relationship with reality TV star Kaitlynn Carter.\n\nInstagram\n\nSimpson revealed that it\u2019s \u201csafe to say\u201d the two are an official pair after they got the rumor mill buzzing with a \u201cmake-out session\u201d in public this week.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy. We are very, very happy,\u201d he said of his romance with Cyrus at a recent event, according to People. \u201cShe\u2019s creative. She\u2019s very passionate about what she does, and I\u2019m very similar in that sense. That\u2019s why we get along so well.\u201d", "description": "The Australian actor went on PDA-filled back-to-back dates with the \u201cDynasty\u201d star.", "authors": ["Entertainment Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da351162100005009acd762.png?cache=u3ahyq6xru&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
