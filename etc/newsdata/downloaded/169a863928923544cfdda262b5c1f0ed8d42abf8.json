However, according to him, the selection process for these women would be very thorough.\n\nAccording to him, the whole pregnancy won't take place in space. It'll just be 24-36 hour mission for the labour. He says this feat is right now only possible in the Lower Earth Orbit, through a very thorough selection procedure including the participants would need to have experience of two flawless deliveries as well as high natural resistance to radiation.\n\nHe said, \"You can induce the labour process like they do in IVF clinics on a daily basis. Planning is, of course, an issue - it is hard to plan a natural process like this if there is something wrong with the weather, or a delay with the launch.\"\n\nDon't Miss 530 SHARES 802 SHARES 436 SHARES 39.1 K SHARES\n\nHe further added, \"We could never work with just one pregnant woman. We would have maybe 30 participants and they could step out at any moment. But the experts that we work with, they believe, and I believe, that this is possible at a lower risk level than an average Western-style delivery on Earth. That would be the only way to make this possible.\"\n\nHowever, he mentioned that while this is possible right now, he isn't planning on doing it anytime soon. He has given a 12-year estimate, pertaining to not just funding but also further developments in space travel.\n\nReuters\n\nPrevious NASA studies have tested rats giving birth in 1-g force in space. While they were successful in delivering babies (even after exposure to microgravity), they experienced twice the labour contractions that they would feel on Earth.\n\nIt'll be really interesting to see how this really pans out, as it will definitely open new avenues for researchers for life in space and beyond. More importantly, one definitely needs to understand that it's not just about the achievement to get it first in space, what's more, important is the health of the child and the mother post-delivery.", "description": "Dr Egbert Edelbroek, founder and CEO of SpaceBorn United stated at the Space and Science Congress of Asgardia- the Space Nation (in Darmstadt in Germany) that the company is creating missions that would allow pregnant women to give birth in the orbit.
