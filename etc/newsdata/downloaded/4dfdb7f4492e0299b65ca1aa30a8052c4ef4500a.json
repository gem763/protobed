You must have known the theft would be found out and the world would come falling down around you.\n\n\u2018You did all this at a time you were preparing for your marriage.\u2019\n\nProsecutor Gerard Rogerson said Doran and Mr Mahone had known each other since school and he proposed two years earlier in September 2015.\n\nThe said the groom and his friends met up at Cleator Moor Celtic FC clubhouse for drinks before the midnight transfer to Leeds Bradford Airport.\n\nBut on arrival at the airport at 5am they discovered the flights and hotel had not been booked.\n\nMr Rogerson said: \u2018It was then it dawned on Mr Mahone what was going on and he realised no bookings were made.\n\n\u2018Paperwork was produced including a Jet2 confirmation form. When it was looked at it became clear it was a fake document.\u2019\n\nThe court heard Mr Mahone tried to ring Doran but she did not answer. She rang back later \u2018wanting to talk\u2019 but was told to \u2018leave him alone and he wanted nothing to do with her\u2019.\n\nIn a victim impact statement Mr Mahone said: \u2018The whole experience has left me embarrassed. I trusted her, I loved her at the time and put all of my trust in her. I\u2019ve lost confidence, I find it difficult to talk to women because I\u2019m scared of getting hurt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I feel sorry Rachel took others\u2019 hard-earned money too.\u2019\n\nThe court heard Doran suffered a number of miscarriages which affected her mental health (Picture: PA)\n\nKim Whittlestone, defending, said Doran suffered three miscarriages in 14 months.\n\n\u2018The impact on her mental health was significant,\u2019 Ms Whittlestone said.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s clear they did have an impact on her state of mind. One can only assume as a result of these pressures she behaved in the way she did.\u2019\n\nShe said Doran did not set out to steal but began dipping into the stag do fund, later applying for loans and gambling to try and claw the money back.\n\nMs Whittlestone said Doran has been \u2018shamed\u2019 and targeted in her community following the scam and had left her home to go and live in a hostel.\n\nShe added that her family and friends had \u2018washed their hands of her\u2019 and she had tried to take her own life.\n\nMs Whittlestone told the court: \u2018This is a devastating case for all involved.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
