Everyone is professional and in all clubs there is talk of players going away,\u201d he told Danish news outlet Ekstra Bladet while on international duty.\n\n\u201cThat side of the matter has no bearing on how we have performed so far this season.\n\n\u201cIf I, as a football player, took all the rumours to me, I would float on a cloud. But I know that it can\u2019t all be true.\n\n\u201cIt does not affect me what is written.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

We have to win every time and it\u2019s the same feeling we have as players as well.\n\n\u201cWe as players must try to keep all the negative things completely out.\n\n\u201cBut the reason for our results is actually hard to answer. We can\u2019t close the matches, even though we are ahead. But we have also been unlucky.\u201d", "description": "Christian Eriksen insists uncertainty surrounding his and some of his Tottenham team-mates\u2019 future is not the cause of their horrible start to the season.
