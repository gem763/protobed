In the overall ranking at the halfway mark, Diocesan Boys\u2019 School (DBS) was holding a comfortable lead in the boys\u2019 category, while Diocesan Girls\u2019 School (DGS) was 70 points ahead of its opponents in the girls\u2019 category.\n\n\n\nThe six new records were mainly from last week\u2019s record-breakers. Michael Cheuk Ming-ho of DBS lived up to expectations of renewing his best time from last year in the Boys\u2019 Grade A 200m Freestyle event, pushing the record from 1:50.30s to 1:50.11s.\n\n\n\nMichael\u2019s schoolmate Wesley Ng Cheuk-yin set a new record in Boys\u2019 Grade A 100m Backstroke. The Form Six student managed to complete the race in 57.38s, 0.2 seconds faster than his personal best time set last month.\n\nSeven records set on first day of Hong Kong Interschool Swimming Competition\n\n\u201cI\u2019m quite satisfied with the time, but I think my turns were not very good, I didn\u2019t propel myself fully,\u201d Wesley said.\n\n\n\nTwo star DGS swimmers also refused to let their supporters down. In Girls\u2019 Grade A 200m Freestyle event, record-holder Tinky Ho Nam-wai smashed her own record from last year to win the race with a new record of 2:02.60s.\n\n\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I thought my performance was just average. I was aiming at a faster time,\u201d the Form Six student said. \u201cFor my afternoon races, I just want to do my best. I don\u2019t want to give myself too much pressure.\u201d\n\nTinky Ho on doing what comes naturally\n\nFellow DGS student Lillian Wong Sze-ting outswam her competitors in the Girls\u2019 Grade B 50 Freestyle event with a record-breaking time of 26.03s.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Chloe Cheng of Marymount Secondary School smashed the Girls\u2019 Grade B 100m Freestyle record, with a faster time of 2:02.00. The teenager said she was facing some really strong opponents this year, such as Audrey Lau Ping-yi of DGS, but she was glad to reach a new personal best time.\n\nChloe Cheng knocked a second off her PB and smashed the Grade B 100m freestyle record.

He finished the Boys\u2019 Grade A 200m Individual Medley event in 2:05.98s. The record was set by a LSC graduate Marcus Mok Kai-tik last year, whom Benz said has inspired him to strive for the best time no matter what.\n\n\n\n\u201cLast year, Marcus was able to set the record right after he returned from the Youth Olympics. He was proof that the number of competitions we take part in shouldn\u2019t limit our performance, I really want to thank him for inspiring me,\u201d the Form Five student said.\n\nBenz Lau broke a La Salle alum's individual medley record.
