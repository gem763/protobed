The move was made possible through donations totaling $160 million.\n\n\u201cThe burden of financial debt is a real issue for potential medical students and graduates ... and we feel that eliminating student debt, for those who qualify, will go a long way to enhance and to mitigate the student stress going forward,\u201d Choi told Yahoo Finance.\n\nA look of the crowd at the announcement.

Upon graduation, they spend five to ten years in residencies \u2014 or fellowships \u2014 where they are paid around $56,000, according to Glassdoor.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s during those first 10 years, they really [are really stressed],\u201d Dr. Choi said. \u201cThis impacts well-being, it contributes to physician burnout, and they may even get a moonlighting job in the evening \u2014 which is very common to pay off the debt.\u201d\n\nOn top of that, \u201cwhen you have burned out physicians, the quality of care that you will [give] to your patients will certainly be compromised,\u201d added Dr. Choi. \u201cSo it's not good for the patients as well. So we believe that this will have long-term and short-term benefits to providing the best care for our patients.\u201d\n\nWeill Cornell isn\u2019t the only medical school in New York that\u2019s offering a full ride. New York University also has a similar program for all students, which offers a full ride regardless of income. Up north, Columbia University also offers a tuition-free program, but it\u2019s similar in design to Weill Cornell\u2019s, which is based on financial need.\n\nScholarship covers all students who qualify for financial aid\n\nWeill Cornell said that 52% of its students will be impacted by this new financial program.\n\nThe program \u2014 or scholarship \u2014 the school explained is available to all medical students with demonstrated financial need, beginning with the current batch of students.\n\n\u201cBy replacing student loans with scholarships that cover tuition, housing and other living expenses, the program ensures that all students, including those from economically diverse backgrounds, can pursue their medical education without financial burden,\u201d the school stated in a press release.\n\nThe cost of attendance at Weill Cornell has been on average $90,000 a year. The average need-based grant for the 2018-9 year was only around $38,000. Students have been left to take out loans to cover the remainder.\n\n\u201cI feel so very blessed to be here right now,\u201d one student told Yahoo Finance. \u201cOne of my biggest hesitations from coming to medical school was the financial costs... Knowing that I would have to take out hundreds of thousand dollars, that was really looming over my head. But now... my medical education is a bit more bearable.\u201d\n\nFunded by donations\n\nThe idea of a debt-free education is a contentious one, which has been proposed by many politicians including Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. But the fact that Weill Cornell was using donations \u2014 not taxpayer money \u2014 was an important one, Bankrate Senior Economic Analyst Mark Hamrick told Yahoo Finance.", "description": "The New York-based college made the announcement on Monday morning to its students in a bid to ease debt pressures and encourage more applicants.
