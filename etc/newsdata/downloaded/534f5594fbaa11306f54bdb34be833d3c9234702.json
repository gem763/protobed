Yet we still have no idea what kind of economic relationship the UK will have with the 27 countries it leaves behind. (Some of the debate in London recalls in its insularity the apocryphal 1930s headline: \u201cFog in Channel: Continent Cut Off\u201d.) Insofar as one can hazard a guess, the most likely outcome seems to be a more remote relationship than Leave supporters talked about in the referendum campaign and than most commentators envisaged shortly after the vote.\n\nBut, despite that change of direction, and the certain loss of the so-called passport, which would allow financial services to be sold freely across the EU, the feared large-scale exodus of firms and financiers from London does not seem to be under way. The French bakeries and German sausage shops are still doing a roaring trade. Why?\n\nThe City of London has an eco-system that is very hard to replicate. Jason Alden\n\nTwo very recent pieces of evidence give a sense of what is happening on the ground, while politicians continue to argue. The accounting firm EY has monitored firms\u2019 declared intentions in response to Brexit over the last three years. The latest survey, published in mid-September, indicates that 40 per cent of firms plan to move some of their operations and staff out of London, while 60 per cent of larger firms have announced such moves.\n\nBut the number of jobs that are to be moved from London to another European city is now only 7,000, far lower than estimates made a couple of years ago. Interestingly, the two locations that, according to EY, have benefited most so far are Dublin and Luxembourg. That is good news for London, because both are niche centres and unlikely to emerge as powerful rivals across the full spectrum of financial activities. Had Paris and Frankfurt been the principal beneficiaries, the long-term consequences could be far more threatening. Their marketing campaigns are so far yielding only modest returns.\n\nThere is, however, some more worrying news for London in the survey. Firms confirm that they are likely to move assets out of the UK on a large scale. The latest estimate is that around \u00a31 trillion (1.8 trillion) of assets under management may move to other centres when Britain leaves the EU. Many employees who are responsible for these assets will remain in London for now, but that could change over time.", "description": "Prophecies of a European challenger for London's financial services crown have proven wide of the mark -- and are likely to remain so, writes Howard Davies the chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_109/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e473aa66a7e5b5b6eb2c1305fdbdc3e9a27d4be4", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
