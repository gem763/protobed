These expectations raise the question though of just how aggressively the Fed can cut rates and still call them an \u201cinsurance\u201d policy against a future downturn, and whether or not the Fed decisions are based on market expectations, rather than the other way around.\n\n\u201cIf the Fed clearly signals that this cut is the last cut for sometime, then I\u2019d expect it a pretty nasty reaction from stocks as markets want more rate cuts, and if markets can\u2019t have more rate cuts they want flexibility for more rate cuts,\u201d wrote Tom Essaye, president of the Sevens Report, in a Tuesday note to clients.\n\nGeraghty argued, however, that tomorrow\u2019s meeting could be a good opportunity to reassert its control over the monetary-policy narrative. \u201cI think it\u2019s very important for the Fed to signal their intentions clearly,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise you\u2019ll drive stock prices artificially higher and the Fed doesn\u2019t want a crash.\u201d", "description": "Analysts fear that the central bank\u2019s prescription of \u201cinsurance\u201d cuts will have run its course, leaving the market without a key pillar of support,...", "authors": ["Chris Matthews", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HG082_jay_po_ZG_20190321070916.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
