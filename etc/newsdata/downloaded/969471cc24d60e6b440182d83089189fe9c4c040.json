There are others about far-off admirers.\n\nThis is a story of both.\n\nIn 2014, Christopher Ward visited an art exhibit that explored the relationship between the French Impressionist Edgar Degas and the American artist Mary Cassatt. The two were inseparable in the late 1870s. They kept studios blocks from each other in Paris and met frequently when in town.\n\nMr. Ward, a playwright, was captivated by the pair. \u201cI looked at my wife and said, \u2018This is a play,\u2019\u201d he recently recalled.\n\nMr. Ward\u2019s \u201cThe Independents,\u201d which began performances on Thursday at the Jerry Orbach Theater in Manhattan , explores the artists\u2019 relationship in the late 1870s. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved Mary Cassatt,\u201d Mr. Ward said. Like writers before him, Mr. Ward was curious about the dynamic between the Cassatt and Degas. Cassatt, a single woman who moved to Paris in 1866 to pursue painting, left few accounts behind. Degas didn\u2019t write much either. Historians agree, though, that it was one of the most significant artistic relationships of that era.", "description": "The artists\u2019 mysterious relationship was one of the most significant of the Impressionist era.
