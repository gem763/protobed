The call, and who from the Trump administration was on it, as was Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, has become a matter of congressional interest.\n\nPentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman told a news briefing that the department\u2019s general counsel\u2019s office has directed all pertinent Ukraine-related documents and records be provided for cataloguing and review. He noted congressional interest in a possible investigation by the Pentagon\u2019s inspector general.\n\nHouse Democrats have launched a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump.\n\nThe Republican president, who denies any wrongdoing, asked his Ukrainian counterpart in a July phone call to investigate whether Biden, his predecessor Barack Obama\u2019s vice president, had shut down an investigation into a gas company that employed his son Hunter.\n\nThe call came after Trump ordered the government to freeze the military aid. He later lifted the freeze, and the Pentagon has resumed sending aid to Ukraine.\n\nIn a separate briefing with reporters, the head of U.S. forces in Europe said he was in favor of sending additional Javelin antitank missiles to Ukraine.\n\n\u201cRight now it is my military advice that I think we should go forward with that,\u201d Air Force General Tod Wolters told reporters at the Pentagon, referring to the sale of additional Javelin missiles to Ukraine.\n\nOn Thursday, the State Department announced that it had approved the potential sale of 150 Javelin missiles to Ukraine.\n\nUkraine is mired in a conflict with pro-Russian separatists in the east of the country.", "description": "No one from the U.S. Defense Department was listening to a July phone conversation between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that is at the heart of a House of Representatives impeachment inquiry, the Pentagon said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
