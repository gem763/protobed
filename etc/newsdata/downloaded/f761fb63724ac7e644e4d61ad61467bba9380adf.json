Tupou failed a head injury assessment and has been ruled of selection.\n\nJapan qualified for the quarterfinals for the first time after topping Pool A with four wins, including an upset over an Irish team that was ranked No. 1 before the tournament.\n\nSouth Africa has won the title twice, but was stung by a shocking loss to Japan in 2015 that was later dubbed the Miracle of Brighton.\n\nJapan starting XV: Ryohei Yamanaka, Kotaro Matsushima, Timothy Lafaele, Ryoto Nakamura, Kenki Fukuoka, Yu Tamura, Yutaka Nagare; Kazuki Himeno, Pieter Labuschagne, Michael Leitch (captain), James Moore, Luke Thompson, Jiwon Koo, Shota Horie, Keita Inagaki.\n\n___\n\n12:40 p.m.\n\nDan Biggar has successfully followed return-to-play protocols following a head injury and has been included in Wales\u2019 team to play France in the quarterfinals on Sunday.\n\nThe flyhalf sustained a concussion in an accidental collision against Fiji in a 29-17 win for the Welsh on Oct. 9. The Welsh Rugby Union says Biggar has remained symptom-free since the game and completed the return-to-play protocols, so he has been deemed fit to play by an independent concussion consultant.\n\nCenter Jonathan Davies has recovered from a knee injury also sustained against Fiji while winger George North has shaken off a knock to his ankle to also start.\n\nIt meant Wales coach Warren Gatland was able to name the same team that started the 29-25 win over Australia in the pool stage.\n\nWales have beaten France seven times in their past eight meetings.\n\nLineup: Liam Williams, George North, Jonathan Davies, Hadleigh Parkes, Josh Adams, Dan Biggar, Gareth Davies; Josh Navidi, Justin Tipuric, Aaron Wainwright, Alun Wyn Jones, Jake Ball, Tomas Francis, Ken Owens, Wyn Jones. Reserves: Elliot Dee, Rhys Carre, Dillon Lewis, Adam Beard, Ross Moriarty, Tomos Williams, Rhys Patchell, Owen Watkin.\n\n___\n\n12:10 p.m.\n\nThe big hits have started between England and Australia before a ball has been kicked in their quarterfinal match.\n\nAustralia flyhalf Matt Toomua was in good form with reporters on Thursday, listing the \u201cweaknesses\u201d of his former teammates at Leicester who will be featuring for England in Oita on Saturday. Among them were Manu Tuilagi being a \u201cterrible snooker player,\u201d George Ford \u201cnever buying a beer\u201d and Ben Youngs not even being the best rugby player in his family, with his brother, Tom, having also played for England.\n\nYoungs responded on Friday after England training.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very happy with himself. He sent me a videotape. And he\u2019s not far wrong with some of it,\u201d Youngs said, smiling. \u201cBut I thought it was quite ironic - he knows what it\u2019s like to play second fiddle, especially being married to Ellyse Perry. I feel for him. He knows my pain.\u201d\n\nPerry is one of Australia\u2019s most famous sportswomen, having represented the country at both football and cricket.\n\n___\n\n11:55 a.m.\n\nJamie Joseph gets to do what no other coach of the Japan national team has ever done at a Rugby World Cup when he announces his squad Friday for the quarterfinal match against South Africa.\n\nJapan is hosting the Rugby World Cup for the first time in Asia, and has reached the knockout stage for the first time after topping Pool A with wins over Ireland, Scotland, Samoa and Russia.\n\nTwo-time champion South Africa placed second in Pool B after an opening loss to the defending champion All Blacks. Despite South Africa\u2019s big win in a warmup match last month against Japan, it\u2019s the game four years ago that is getting most attention before this Sunday\u2019s quarterfinal at Tokyo Stadium. Japan\u2019s win over the Springboks at Brighton in 2015 was the biggest shocker ever at the tournament.\n\nThis time, the Japan team knows it won\u2019t be sneaking up on any teams.\n\nWales and France will also confirm their lineups for their quarterfinal meeting in Oita on Sunday.\n\nIn the first of the quarterfinals on Saturday, Australia and England will meet in Oita and New Zealand will play Ireland in Tokyo.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Latest on Friday at the Rugby World Cup in Japan (all times local):", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
