Hagibis will pass but the turbulent air at the Scuderia may continue to roll.\n\nTeam orders left Ferrari looking poorly organised and impotent at the previous race in Russia. They want more victories now they have the car to achieve them. But, as Lewis Hamilton suggested, perhaps what they need \u2013 with the mechanical finally firing \u2013 is a rethink.\n\nIn Sochi, Ferrari attempted to micromanage the start between Charles Leclerc and Sebastian Vettel. Vettel took the lead and disobeyed orders to give it back, and the team could not explain why they had used such intricate instructions and yet not made their implementation clear to both drivers. They also failed to appreciate that Vettel might choose to interpret the plan in his own way. As well may Leclerc in future.\n\nJapan orders evacuations as Typhoon Hagibis arrives Read more\n\nFerrari started the season with Vettel the clear No 1 driver. Leclerc\u2019s performances, not least two wins in the past four races, have usurped him and the two were at odds in Russia. Both pointed out in Japan that the matter has been discussed and clarified. \u201cWe need to obey team orders and what is clear is that the situation wasn\u2019t clear for both of the drivers starting the race,\u201d said Leclerc. \u201cI think that\u2019s most important.\u201d\n\nYet perhaps clarity is not the most important aspect, but rather the fundamental shift that has occurred in the team. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting dynamic they have there, because obviously Seb was No 1, and now clearly not,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cFrom the energy, from the outlook, [Ferrari is] trying to ramp Charles up to be [the No 1]. Is that good for a team? I don\u2019t think so. But that\u2019s the philosophy they\u2019ve had forever.\u201d\n\nFerrari have pursued a lead-driver policy extensively. When Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen played second fiddle to Vettel it made no difference, with harmony ensured by Vettel being quicker than his teammate. Leclerc has allowed no such comfort and suddenly shifting focus from one driver to another is rarely harmonious.\n\nHamilton experienced this in his debut season, joining McLaren where then world champion Fernando Alonso was No 1. When the young Briton proved himself almost immediately and became a title challenger, McLaren gave him equal footing. \u201cWhen I was with Fernando, he was the hired No 1,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then mid-season that dynamic shifted, and it didn\u2019t go well for the team.\u201d\n\nHamilton joined Mercedes in 2013, where the team allow their drivers to race with no No 1 designated driver (albeit within rules of engagement). He believes he has enjoyed a management philosophy from which Ferrari should learn.\n\n\u201cOver the course of history you\u2019ve seen world champions in the same team and there\u2019s always going to be friction in a racing team because you\u2019ve got this conflicting target,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s the team but it\u2019s also an individual target between the two drivers. So you are constantly trying to balance that conflict. It\u2019s all about trying to find the balance and how it\u2019s managed from the top down. It\u2019s just about respect and how it\u2019s managed.\u201d\n\nFerrari\u2019s principal, Mattia Binotto, admitted he could still not guarantee control over his two forceful talents. \u201cHow much I\u2019m confident it will not happen [again], I\u2019m not at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI think these are both very good drivers. They are all going for a single objective which is winning themselves but what is more important is that at least we, between us, we\u2019ve got clarity and fairness and that\u2019s key.\u201d\n\nBeware the enemy within: Leclerc and Vettel continue a timeless F1 tradition | Richard Williams Read more\n\nThe problem he and Ferrari face is that this approach, however much clarity is applied, may still not work. Perhaps the concept of a favoured lead driver must be discarded. Mercedes, who could secure their record-equalling sixth consecutive constructors\u2019 title in Japan, have done handsomely without it, as Hamilton wryly observed.\n\n\u201cThere are different philosophies up and down the paddock,\u201d he said. \u201cProbably mostly just between our two teams in particular and over the following years we will see if it works or it doesn\u2019t. It hasn\u2019t worked for a long time over there [Ferrari] and most likely will not work going forwards either, but that\u2019s not bad for us.\u201d", "description": "Sebastian Vettel started the year as Ferarri\u2019s lead driver but his young teammate has disrupted the status quo", "authors": ["Giles Richards"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af49a53a7104eee818085d97d6c64766ed4a05ce/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d9295a9769a713cd0e14dc3dce86738c", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
