If markets make a new all-time-high and still have the support of the central banks, that\u2019s good for liquidity; liquidity will go into BTC, and \u201cif there\u2019s an interest in acquiring some volatility, that\u2019s where you\u2019re going to see people buying BTC\u201d.

S&P\u2019s best years in the last decade have coincided with BTC\u2019s best years, he says.\n\nOn the question about Bitcoin being a hedge against risk, Lee replied: \u201cBTC may be ambidextrous [\u2026] in that it works well in a risk-on world, but when you start to get nervous, then you treat it like digital gold. What we had in the summer was neither environment; it was a market that looked like it was on a precipice, that looked like it could fall \u2014 but it never did. And I think getting stuck in that trend was bad for BTC.\u201d\n\nLee thinks that \u201cwe\u2019re inching closer\u201d to record-highs. \u201cOur base case has been for a second-half rally in the S&P 500 to greater that 3,125 \u2013 all-time-high is around 3,025 \u2013 I think we\u2019re going to surpass that soon, and it would be bullish for Bitcoin.\u201d Furthermore, if those two hit an all-time-high, it may bring about the start of an alt season.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cimg.co/w/videos/0/5d7/b6b988287d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
