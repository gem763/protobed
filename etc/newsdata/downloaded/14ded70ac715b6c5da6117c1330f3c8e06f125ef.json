He said that no party except VOX had truly fought against the separatist movement.\n\n\u201cSpain is at a critical moment when the three powers have failed: the executive because it came to the allied power with the same ones who want to annihilate Spain; the legislature because with its inaction has allowed the separatists to reach this point; and the judiciary for having made a ruling tailored to the ruling party and its separatist partners,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile being critical of the three branches of government, Abascal praised the Spanish Crown, currently headed by King Felipe VI, saying: \u201cThe only institution that has lived through Spain\u2019s historic moments, as well as the only one that has fulfilled its obligations to the Spanish people, has been the Crown.\u201d\n\nAbascal went on to add that VOX would seek to implement a state of emergency under article 116 of the Spanish constitution to \u201crestore order and constitutional legality in Catalonia\u201d.\n\n\u201cOnce the constitutional order has been restored, we will proceed to call for the illegalisation of the separatist parties,\u201d he said.\n\nAbascal also commented on the \u201cTsunami Democr\u00e0tic\u201d group currently under investigation by Spanish authorities which recently distributed fake boarding passes in El Prat airport to disrupt air travel.\n\n\u201cThe Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic is a new tool created by separatism to destabilise Spain through violent actions aimed at breaking our homeland and subduing the people of Catalonia,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe Catalan oligarchs [are] encouraging violent groups to sow chaos with a general blessing,\u201d he added.\n\nThe group has been likened to the Hong Kong demonstrators by some due to their decentralised nature.\n\nYouTube Blacklists Spain\u2019s Populist \u2018Vox\u2019 Political Party https://t.co/TvlQJYWmhN \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 20, 2019\n\nVOX has seen a surge of growth in the last year, winning 11 per cent of the vote in last year\u2019s regional election in Andalusia. In April, the party entered the Spanish national parliament for the first time.\n\nDue to a lack of a coalition deal, Spain faces yet another national election in November.
