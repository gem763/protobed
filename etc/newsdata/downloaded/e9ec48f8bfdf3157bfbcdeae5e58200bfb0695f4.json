Democrats say they expect her to appear despite the White House\u2019s position that no administration officials cooperate with the probe.\n\nYovanovitch was recalled from Kyiv in May as Giuliani \u2014 who is Trump\u2019s personal attorney and has no official role in the U.S. government \u2014 pushed Ukrainian officials to investigate baseless corruption allegations against the Bidens.\n\nIn a July 25 call, Trump told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that Yovanovitch was \u201cbad news,\u201d according to a partial transcript released by the White House.\n\nNeither Giuliani nor Trump have specified their objections. But a former diplomat, recalling a recent conversation with Yovanovich, said she was removed after insisting that a request for Ukrainian officials to join in an investigation be relayed according to long-established protocol.\n\nThe former diplomat said Yovanovitch refused to do \u201call this offline, personal, informal stuff\u201d and made clear that the U.S. government had formal ways to request foreign governments\u2019 help with investigations.\n\nThe former diplomat insisted on anonymity to disclose the private conversation.\n\nThe State Department traditionally relies on mutual legal assistance treaties, under which U.S. and foreign officials agree to exchange evidence and information in criminal investigations.\n\nYovanovitch is scheduled to speak to the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Reform committees behind closed doors Friday as part of the impeachment investigation. Despite Trump\u2019s assertion that his administration will not cooperate, three people familiar with the deposition said that Yovanovitch is expected to appear. The people requested anonymity to discuss the closed-door meeting.\n\nOn Thursday, 10 Democratic senators sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo demanding an explanation for Yovanovitch\u2019s removal before the end of her three-year assignment.\n\n\u201cIn particular, her early recall raises questions about whether you put the personal interests of the President above the Department\u2019s career personnel or U.S. foreign policy,\u201d they wrote.\n\nEarlier this week, the White House sent Congress a letter outlining its opposition to the impeachment probe and refusing to cooperate with requests for information, including interviews with administration officials. The House committees have moved to subpoena officials instead.\n\nEven before the testimony, the attention on Yovanovitch was renewed Thursday after U.S. prosecutors arrested two Florida businessmen tied to Giuliani, charging them with campaign finance violations. An indictment filed in the case alleged that the men, who were raising campaign funds for a U.S. congressman, asked him for help in removing Yovanovitch, at least partly at the request of Ukrainian government officials.\n\nYovanovitch has led U.S. embassies in Kyrgyzstan and Armenia and is now a State Department fellow at Georgetown University. The director of the Georgetown program, Barbara Bodine, said the former envoy is declining all requests for interviews.\n\nFormer colleagues of Yovanovich said Trump allies\u2019 characterizations of her as politically motivated are off-base.\n\nShe is \u201ca top-notch diplomat, careful, meticulous, whip smart,\u201d and unlikely to have badmouthed Trump, either to Ukrainian officials or her colleagues, said John Herbst, a predecessor as ambassador in Ukraine who worked alongside Yovanovitch there in the early 2000s.\n\nYovanovitch has always known that the role of diplomat \u201cwasn\u2019t about her\u201d but about \u201cserving American national interests and supporting the people around her,\u201d said Nancy McEldowney, a former U.S. ambassador to Bulgaria who now directs a Foreign Service program at Georgetown.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Writer Jocelyn Noveck contributed to this report.", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine was removed from her post after insisting that Rudy Giuliani's requests to Ukrainian officials for", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/10/01b520_trump-impeachment-ukraine-ambassador-15689-marie-yovanovitch-in-nov-30-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
