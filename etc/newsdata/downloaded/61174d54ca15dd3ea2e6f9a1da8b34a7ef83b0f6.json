Those would be symptoms that we wouldn\u2019t expect to see in an otherwise healthy teenager without any other explainable cause.\"\n\nNot knowing what could be behind their symptoms, the doctors ran tests and conducted a \"social history\" that asked the teens about their lives and habits to find the cause.

New statistics will be released on Thursday.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control report that 62% of patients are between 18 and 34 years old -- and 38% are younger than 21.\n\nIt was also found that most of the lung illnesses associated with vaping involve THC, with or without nicotine.\n\nDoctors are advising people to be honest with their physicians if they are experiencing similar symptoms and to be treated immediately.\n\n\"It\u2019s very important to be honest and to tell your trusted health care provider all the details that you can think of related to vaping especially if you\u2019re experiencing an unexplained cough, weight loss, fatigue or other respiratory symptoms,\" Gutzeit said.\n\nAbove all, they\u2019re urging people to stop vaping all together.\n\nDr. Louella Amos, a pulmonologist at Children\u2019s Hospital of Wisconsin who was part of that group of physicians to see the outbreak first hand, said, \"My mantra is that nothing other than air should be inhaled.\"", "description": "Doctors who first sounded the alarm on the vaping outbreak speak out about how they first saw the signs of an epidemic.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/vape-pens-display-rt-jt-190917_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
