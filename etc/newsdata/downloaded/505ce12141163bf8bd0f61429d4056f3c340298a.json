Bernie Sanders addresses union members in Ottumwa, Iowa, in July. He wants to expand worker ownership of the companies that employ them.\n\nBut critics of worker-owned companies, including some socialists, have noted that even those companies are subject to the competitive demands of a global, for-profit market. That means that worker-owners are often under pressure to embrace exploitative practices even if those practices negatively affect them and their co-workers.\n\nStill, Sanders believes that more worker-owners would at least be a monumental improvement on the status quo.\n\nWith that in mind, he would also force corporations to give their workers the right of first refusal to buy the company before it is shuttered or sold. Companies that automate jobs or outsource them to cheaper workers in other countries would have to give the affected American employees shares in the company. And he would create a U.S. employee ownership bank, which would provide loans to workers trying to buy the companies that employ them, as well as centers to teach the advantages of worker ownership to employees and those business owners looking to sell.\n\nIn addition, Sanders\u2019 corporate accountability plan features an array of changes to corporate governance, tax law and antitrust enforcement. Sanders would ban large-scale stock buybacks and force corporations to obtain new federal charters requiring them to weight the interests of the diverse array of stakeholders rather than just shareholders.\n\nHe is calling for the restoration of the top corporate income tax rate of 35%, which was cut to 21% under President Donald Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cut legislation, and the closing of loopholes and tightening of disclosure requirements to crack down on the use of offshore tax havens. Other Democratic presidential candidates, such as Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, have said they are open to raising the top corporate tax rate to the high 20s, but not to its pre-2017 level.\n\nSanders also plans to toughen up antitrust enforcement on U.S. corporations by overhauling the Federal Trade Commission; writing merger rules that weigh impacts on workers and innovation, rather than just price competition; and barring companies from forcing workers into non-compete agreements and other anti-competitive practices.\n\nAs Sanders scrambles to improve his standing in the polls and regain momentum after his heart attack at the start of the month, he has been releasing a steady stream of ambitious policy proposals, most of which relate to his signature issue of economic inequality. In the past few weeks, he has put out plans to eliminate medical debt, curb CEO pay and get rid of corporate money in politics.\n\nSanders\u2019 obvious competitor in the Democratic contest for progressive economic ideas is Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who has surpassed him in both national and early-state polling.\n\nThe closest analog to Sanders\u2019 corporate accountability and democracy reforms is Warren\u2019s Accountable Capitalism Act, a bill she introduced in August 2018 that requires 40% of corporate board members to be chosen by employees. She does not yet have a plan to devolve corporate ownership to workers as well.\n\nCorporate reform has been a strong suit for Warren, but Sanders evidently believes it is an area where she can be bested. Warren drew criticism from left-wing commentators for a Friday tweet from her Senate account that detractors thought painted an overly rosy picture of labor-management relations prior to the country\u2019s rightward economic shift in the 1970s and \u201980s.\n\n\u201cFor most of America\u2019s history, when our companies did better, our workers did better \u2015 and America built a thriving middle class,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe Accountable Capitalism Act will help realign our skewed market incentives so companies & workers can once again do well together.\u201d\n\nThe Sanders campaign still sees the types of working-class voters who gravitate toward former Vice President Joe Biden as ripe targets for persuasion. But his team has grown increasingly willing to draw distinctions between him and Warren, signaling a weakening of the truce they had reportedly negotiated before launching their respective presidential campaigns.\n\nIn an interview with ABC News\u2019 Jonathan Karl that aired on Sunday, Sanders began to underscore their differences.\n\n\u201cElizabeth, I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am, I believe, the only candidate who\u2019s going to say to the ruling class of this country, the corporate elite, \u2018Enough, enough with your greed and with your corruption,\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cWe need real change in this country.\u201d", "description": "Big companies would have to give 20% of their shares to employees under a new proposal from the Democratic candidate.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da3e806200000330b50075b.jpeg?cache=bedhz6cmsn&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
