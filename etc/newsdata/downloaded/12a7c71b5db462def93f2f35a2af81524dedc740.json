But after holding off the field in a dramatic parallel bars final, he left with a number of superlatives to his name.\n\nFraser is only Great Britain\u2019s third world champion in any gymnastics discipline, and he is the youngest we have ever had. From a broader perspective, he has also become the first black male to claim gold at this level.\n\n\u201cI was not aware of that until I did an interview with a reporter from the BBC,\u201d Fraser said of this last honour. \u201cWhen she told me, I was astounded. It\u2019s pretty cool, the first of many records I hope.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been incredible, the amount of support I have had since I got home on Monday. Everyone has been really supportive, and has helped me deal with this new title, but I am still finding it surreal.\u201d", "description": "The breakthrough star of last week\u2019s World Gymnastics Championships, 20-year-old Joe Fraser, told The Daily Telegraph on Wednesday of his next ambitions:", "authors": ["Simon Briggs", "Tennis Correspondent", "Sam Wallace", "Brian Moore", "Mick Cleary"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/gymnastics/2019/10/16/TELEMMGLPICT000212908077-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqNadeZm0KzkFwpSYJhHDpPbQMI5hkDcUBB5qZKQzbZSY.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
