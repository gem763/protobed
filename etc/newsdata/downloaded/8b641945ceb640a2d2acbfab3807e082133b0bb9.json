Magnetic pulses pass through an electromagnetic coil which is held to a patient\u2019s head. Clicking sounds fill the room and the patient\u2019s neural activity is temporarily altered over the course of a few minutes.\n\nA brain scan is visible to her right, the target area already visualised.\n\n\u201cThe neuronavigation tells you whether or not you\u2019re at the right place,\u201d Gallop says of the process, known as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). \u201cIt\u2019s replicable so you know when the participants come in the next time, you\u2019re stimulating the same area.\u201d\n\nGallop\u2019s work carries deep personal significance: \u201cMy sister had anorexia so I was exposed to family therapy from a young age. And truthfully, it really exposed me to how treatment is very difficult \u2013 making a full recovery from anorexia is very difficult.\u201d\n\nNew treatment innovations are urgently needed for eating disorders, which affect an estimated 1.25 million people in the UK. Hospital admissions have almost doubled in the last six years and patients are sent hundreds of miles away from home for treatment. Earlier this month, new figures showed that one in six consultant posts in eating disorder services are vacant. Patients with eating disorders are twice as likely to die prematurely than the general population.\n\nResults from the project, led by the psychiatrist Prof Ulrike Schmidt at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King\u2019s College London, have been cautiously promising.\n\n\u201cOur brain imaging and behavioural studies suggest that the way in which rTMS might work is by reducing activity in a brain region \u2013 the amygdala, involved in anxiety and threat responses \u2013 and dampening patients\u2019 emotional arousal, stress and anxiety,\u201d says Schmidt.\n\nQuick guide What is the Upside? Show Hide Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame? This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.

It also appears to influence their choices, shifting towards \u201chigh-calorie tasty foods rather than their typical anorexia very low-calorie choices\u201d.\n\nUltimately, she says, that means patients become more relaxed around eating. One participant credited rTMS for helping to dim the \u201cpunishing thoughts and catastrophic guilt\u201d she had endured in her 30 years with anorexia.\n\n\u201cWhilst the difference is small, it is hugely significant. It has allowed me to eat morsels of food that would have not only been immediately dismissed before the therapy, they would have made me want to scream,\u201d the patient said.\n\nIt is relatively early days for rTMS (which has also been trialled in bulimia), which the researchers emphasise currently works best alongside traditional talking therapy. A 2018 randomised controlled trial showed 45% of those with anorexia receiving real rTMS reached normal weight 18 months after the study, compared with about 10% of those who received a sham treatment.\n\nHowever, participant numbers were small and there was a placebo effect during treatment. \u201cOne needs to exert a degree of caution here,\u201d Schmidt says, warning about the unrealistic promises some private rTMS clinics are making to patients and families. \u201cOnly proper large-scale trials will be able to answer the question of whether the early encouraging results of rTMS treatment in anorexia nervosa hold up to further scrutiny.\u201d\n\nThe huge demand for treatment, and the paucity of existing services, appear to be stimulating an array of experimentation in the field. A second \u201cneuro-hack\u201d under development involves deep brain stimulation (DBS), an established surgical procedure in Parkinson\u2019s. Seven people with longstanding and severe anorexia have been recruited to a pilot study at the University of Oxford \u2013 preliminary results are expected towards the end of 2020.\n\nThe aim, explains one of the investigators, the psychiatrist Rebecca Park, is to stimulate a brain region called the nucleus accumbens, the \u201chedonic hotspot\u201d which is central to reward processing.\n\n\u201cIn eating disorders, what is rewarding in life changes,\u201d Parks explains. \u201cIt\u2019s as if reward becomes warped towards pursuit of thinness. The eating and exercise rituals, obsessions and habits that characterise the disorder become entrenched over time.\u201d\n\nThe DBS process, which can trigger complications, involves implanting electrodes into the brain that are linked by extension leads to an implanted pulse generator (in the form of a rechargeable pacemaker) placed beneath the skin below the collarbone.\n\nThe researchers quote \u201can overall risk of stroke of less than 1%, a haemorrhage-causing death of 0.01% and a risk of wound infection of 5%\u201d. There are concerns about trialling a treatment that is so invasive and experimental without definitive data to support its use. The team\u2019s ethical framework will include \u201cchecks and balances at all stages, supported by an independent ethicist who will act as a patient advocate\u201d.\n\nPark concedes \u201cthere is a risk of instilling false hope, as DBS is not a magic bullet and is unlikely to help everyone\u201d. Nevertheless she believes that evaluating it ethically for anorexia is a step in the right direction.\u201d\n\nA third group of researchers based in Barcelona are innovating in a completely different space: a video game with built-in biofeedback that rewards emotional control.\n\nOn a virtual tropical island, gamers enjoy sun and sand before experiencing tumultuous storms. The app is connected through Bluetooth to a single sensor that transmits heart rate and heart rate variability data from participants to the device. If participants can regulate their reactions and remain calm, their cardiac response is registered by the sensor, which rewards them by dissipating the storm. If they cannot regulate their emotions, the storm intensifies.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Screenshot from the game e-Estesia, being developed as a treatment for eating disorders... Photograph: e-Estesia\n\nThis is biofeedback \u2013 gameplay dynamically adjusting to reactions. Improving this sort of emotional control can help those with eating and gambling disorders, conditions which both affect impulse control and emotional regulation, says Fernando Fern\u00e1ndez-Aranda, head of the eating disorders unit at Bellvitge University hospital in Barcelona, who developed the game along with colleague Susana Jim\u00e9nez-Murcia.\n\nNone of these innovations can mask a shortfall of funding and expertise, as evidenced by the deaths of Averil Hart, who endured \u201cclear failures of care\u201d, and Hannah Bharaj, who was denied anorexia treatment. A recent Commons report concluded a lack of understanding was costing lives. Making the most of emerging technologies also means training health professionals and funding resources.\n\nMeanwhile, trials like the one at King\u2019s College London will continue to search for treatments. Gallop, whose sister did eventually recover, aims to trial TMS in younger people, who she believes might respond especially well because of their brain plasticity.\n\n\u201cI think it gives parents hope,\u201d she says, \u201cespecially if your child has already gone through an unsuccessful trial of talking therapy, you kind of feel like you\u2019re running out of options.\u201d\n\nFor these families, the hunt for a cure must continue.\n\nThis article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.
