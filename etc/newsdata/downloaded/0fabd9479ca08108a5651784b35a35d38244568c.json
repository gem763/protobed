Let's see what that investment may do to the price of MO in the weeks ahead.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of MO, below, we can see that prices have been in a downtrend for much of the past 12 months. Prices are retesting the late December low so will we need to look at a weekly chart for next support. MO is below both moving averages -- 50- and 200-days -- and both averages have negative slopes. The On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has been weakening from April and tells us that sellers of MO have been more aggressive. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator has been below the zero line since late April.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of MO, below, we went back 10 years to find what might be \"next support.\" The farther to the left you go on a chart the less reliable a support (or resistance) level becomes. MO is below the declining 40-week moving average line. The weekly OBV line is bearish and so is the MACD oscillator.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of MO, below, we can see a bearish downside price objective of $34.60.\n\nBottom line strategy: All kinds of government entities will be lining up against Juul, lawsuits with big awards are coming and who knows what else.
