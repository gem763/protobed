This week, the White House finally announced initial appointments to the President\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, and \u2014 to no one\u2019s shock at all \u2014 it\u2019s overwhelmingly dominated by industry interests. The message the White House is sending once again is clear: This is an administration of business, not science.\n\nOf the seven announced members on Trump\u2019s council, only one \u2014 K. Birgitta Whaley, an expert in quantum physics at the University of California at Berkeley \u2014 works at an academic institution. Two don\u2019t have doctoral degrees, The Post reported Tuesday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe most troubling of the new members is A.N. Sreeram, chief technology officer at Dow Chemical, a company that has already played an unseemly role in the Trump administration. The chemical company donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration funds, and its then-chief executive, Andrew Liveris, served as an adviser to the president early in the administration and helped develop a 2017 executive order directing government agencies to evaluate federal regulations that were supposedly \u201cpunishing companies.\u201d Later, the administration reversed course on a proposal to ban chlorpyrifos, a pesticide then produced by Dow Chemical, despite conclusions from the Environmental Protection Agency that it has harmful effects on children\u2019s brain development.\n\nSreeram himself has made alarming statements. Last year, he said in an interview with the Economic Times that lithium ion battery-powered cars were a \u201cfad,\u201d downplaying the threat of global warming and promoting diesel-fueled vehicles. \u201cI am glad that the globe is warming, because Michigan was under 2 km of snow 12,000 years ago,\u201d Sreeram said.\n\nSreeram declined to comment for this article, though a representative from Dow Chemical said the quote doesn\u2019t reflect the views of the company.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat Trump is staffing his scientific advisory council with mostly industry voices doesn\u2019t tell us much new about the president. For almost three years, his administration has been ignoring, silencing and disparaging scientists, including those in his own agencies.\n\nBut the White House council has some symbolic significance. Since the Truman administration, the president\u2019s scientific advisory council has served primarily as an institution of good governance. Previous White Houses have displayed it as evidence that the president is listening to scientists on the pressing scientific issues facing the nation. That\u2019s why previous administrations \u2014 Republican and Democratic alike \u2014 have named members of their council in the first year of their terms. Barack Obama announced several of his appointees as president-elect.\n\nIt\u2019s not wrong for the council to include industry voices; a major part of the council\u2019s purpose is to advise the president on the technology challenges facing the U.S. economy. We should want smart business people to contribute to the president\u2019s understanding of these issues. But to have a council tilted so far toward industry voices only furthers the expectation that Trump\u2019s decisions will fall in their favor or that their reports might ignore pressing scientific issues, such as the effects of climate change.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe White House has time to correct this. The council is expected to expand to 16 members, giving the president plenty of space to appoint independent thinkers. But it\u2019s difficult to imagine him embracing the task. Nor will it be easy for the White House to find bona fide scientists who are willing to take on the job if it means years of being disparaged or ignored.\n\nSuch is reality when the president touts drilling on public land while denigrating the Endangered Species Act; promoting the coal industry while downplaying climate change; and staffing his administration with business interests while gutting government science agencies. And every time industry interests win out over scientists, there\u2019s one clear loser: the public.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD\n\nAD", "description": "His newly announced scientific advisory council is dominated by industry-aligned experts.
