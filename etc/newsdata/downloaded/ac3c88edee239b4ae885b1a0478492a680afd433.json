Heated press conferences and interviews leading up to the bout ended with a statement victory from McGregor. Poirier was defeated by technical knockout just 1:46 into the opening round.\n\nThe contest marked the last time Poirier competed at 145 pounds, while it brought McGregor closer to his first UFC title as the 2015 Featherweight Championship.\n\nPoirier moved up to lightweight and has since amassed a 9-2 record with one no contest.\n\nNow, it appears he wants a chance to avenge the loss.\n\nMcGregor has not competed since being defeated by Nurmagomedov at UFC 229 in October 2018. He announced his shocking retirement from MMA in March 2019 but has recently expressed interest in fighting again before the end of the year.\n\nRead more: Conor McGregor says he thinks he will fight again this year \u2014 and that he wants a rematch with Khabib Nurmagomedov", "description": "Dustin Poirier tweeted on Tuesday that he believes a rematch with Conor McGregor \"makes a lot of sense at this point.\"", "authors": ["Alexandra Licata"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7813e92e22af1efd5a01d3-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
