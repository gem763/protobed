It looks bad, it smells bad.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not illegal. Nothing is illegal about it,\u201d the reporter continues. \u201cI mean, you\u2019re benefiting from your father\u2019s name. You\u2019re trading his name.\u201d\n\nThe undercover reporter, playing along with Perez\u2019s claims that the vice president\u2019s son didn\u2019t break any laws, is heard replying: \u201cEverybody does that, though.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the problem,\u201d Perez is seen responding. \u201cHow do you go and say that Donald Trump is the person, get him out of here and convict him when your son is doing the same shit?\u201d\n\nProject Veritas\u2019s undercover video release came just hours after ABC News aired its high-anticipated interview with Hunter Biden, who denied accusations of corruption regarding his business dealings in China and Ukraine. However, in the same interview, he conceded to having poor judgment by conducting business with foreign-owned companies while his father \u2014 2020 Democrat White House hopeful former Vice President Joe Biden \u2014 was in the Obama White House.\n\n\u201cIn retrospect, look, I think that it was poor judgment on my part,\u201d Biden told ABC News interviewer Amy Robach. \u201cIs that I think that it was poor judgment because I don\u2019t believe now when I look back on it \u2014 I know that there was \u2014 did nothing wrong at all. However, was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is a swamp in\u2014in\u2014in many ways? Yeah.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I take full responsibility for that,\u201d he continued. \u201cDid I do anything improper? No, not in any way. Not in any way whatsoever. Did I make a mistake based upon some ethical lapse? Absolutely not.\u201d\n\nLater in the interview, Biden conceded he would \u201cprobably not\u201d have been a board member of Ukrainian energy giant Burisma Holdings if he were not the son of a vice president.\n\n\u201cI gave a hook to some very unethical people to act in illegal ways to try to do some harm to my father,\u201d he stated. \u201cThat\u2019s where I made the mistake.\u201d\n\nAs Breitbart News extensively reported on Hunter Biden\u2019s foreign business activities.\n\n[The younger Biden\u2019s] investment company scored a $1.5 billion investment deal with the Bank of China after traveling with his father on Air Force Two to the country in 2013. In regard to Ukraine, Hunter Biden was paid $83,000 monthly as a board member of the gas giant Burisma Holdings, despite having no expertise in the energy section. The former vice president forced out former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin as he was investigating Burisma Holdings and even boasted to the Council of Foreign Relations last year that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired.\n\nTuesday\u2019s video is part of an ongoing series by Project Veritas in which the group will release undercover footage from inside CNN aimed at further revealing the news network\u2019s partisan slant. Monday\u2019s video showed a CNN media coordinator stating network president Jeff Zucker harbors a \u201cpersonal vendetta\u201d against President Donald Trump.", "description": "An undercover video released by Project Veritas shows CNN's Evan Perez saying Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings \"smells bad.\"", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/evan-perez-hunter-biden-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
