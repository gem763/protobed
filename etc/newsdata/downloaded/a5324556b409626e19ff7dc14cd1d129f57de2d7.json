The Falcons sent a sixth-round pick to Philadelphia and acquired a seventh-rounder.\n\nThe trade comes one week after the Falcons lost strong safety Keanu Neal to a season-ending torn left Achilles tendon.\n\nThe 29-year-old Cyprien had only one tackle for the Eagles this season. He started a combined 70 games in his first five NFL seasons, including four with Jacksonville. He started 10 games for Tennessee in 2017 and missed the 2018 season with a knee injury.\n\nThe 25-year-old Riley, a third-round pick from LSU in 2017, was a backup in Atlanta\u2019s first four games this season. He started a combined 16 games his first two seasons.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Atlanta Falcons have bolstered their safety position by acquiring Johnathan Cyprien from Philadelphia in a trade that sent linebacker Duke Riley to the Eagles.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
