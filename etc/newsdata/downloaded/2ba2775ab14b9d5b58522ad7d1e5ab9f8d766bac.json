REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/Files\n\nFrom killings to violent robberies and kidnappings for ransom, crime has been surging in recent years in the East African country, stoking widespread public anger.\n\nUgandans complain that most crimes go unsolved because police are corrupt and not interested in investigating cases involving ordinary citizens, although security officials deny this.\n\n\u201cWe need to work on the courts,\u201d Museveni said in a statement posted on his official social media accounts late on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThey need to move quickly on the cases of murder...the punishments must also be severe, including the hanging of killers.\u201d\n\nThe ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM) party, he said, believed in a justice system that extracts \u2018an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth\u2019.\n\n\u201cWe need to make this clear to the courts. It must be an eye-for-eye,\u201d Museveni said. \u201cNothing less will be acceptable.\u201d\n\nDeath is the maximum penalty in Uganda for a range of crimes including murder, treason and defilement, but executions are rare.\n\nMuseveni\u2019s statement came after two recent murders figured extensively in Ugandan media.\n\nLast Thursday, his nephew was found lying on his back on the tarmac on an expressway near the capital, dead from gunshot wounds. His body was found near his parked vehicle, where a woman was in the back seat, also dead from gunshot wounds.\n\nOn Aug. 30, the bodies of a woman working for a local non-governmental organisation and her driver were found dumped in a swamp just east of the capital Kampala, two days after they were kidnapped in their own vehicle outside the gate of the woman\u2019s home.\n\nMuseveni blamed the deaths of the NGO worker and her driver partly on the negligence of police officers who, he said, had not acted swiftly to use a recently installed CCTV system on all Kampala roads to intercept their vehicle and rescue the victims.\n\nPolice who were negligent, he said, have been arrested and he has ordered that they be tried and dismissed.\n\n\u201cIf those who are in uniform today cannot do their job, there are plenty who will replace them.\u201d", "description": "Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni has said he wants courts to hand out eye-for-an-eye-style sentences for all murder convicts, to help stem soaring violent crime that claimed the life of his nephew last week.", "authors": ["Elias Biryabarema", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428588390&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A0DE", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
