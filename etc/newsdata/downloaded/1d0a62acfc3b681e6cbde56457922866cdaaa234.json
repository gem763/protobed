Photo: Courtesy of Networks\n\nThe twin forces of Peak TV and the streaming era ensure that a massive TV event is always looming, no matter what month it is. Yet the allure of the traditional fall TV season remains strong, with broadcast networks saving their (potentially) best and brightest for an autumn bow, and streaming purveyors rising to the occasion with their own high-profile shows \u2026 or their own high-profile programming slates, as this year sees the addition of two major players to the streaming game.\n\nWhile much of what Disney+ and Apple TV+ will offer still remains shrouded in mystery, both nascent platforms will launch with attention-grabbing, big-name original series this fall, in the midst of a season with no shortage of attention-grabbing, big-name series. The TV landscape may be massive, but at least there will always be something worth watching. Here\u2019s what you should keep on your radar in the months ahead.\n\nWhat We Think Will Be Great\n\nBy Matt Zoller Seitz\n\nSeptember\n\nBless the Harts (Fox; 9/29)\n\nIn the spirit of Bob\u2019s Burgers and King of the Hill, this animated sitcom is about a poor North Carolina family whose love for one another helps them weather a brutal American economy. Kristen Wiig stars as the heroine, a single mother and waitress; Maya Rudolph plays her lottery-obsessed mother. Created by former Saturday Night Live writer Emily Spivey (who created the short-lived but very likable parenting sitcom Up All Night, starring Rudolph, Will Arnett, and Christina Applegate).\n\nOctober\n\nAlmost Family (Fox; 10/2)\n\nAdapted from the Australian comedy series Sisters, the plot of this comedy-drama is sparked by the revelation that a fertility doctor (Timothy Hutton) fathered 100 children by various patients without their knowledge or consent. Brittany Snow, Megalyn Echikunwoke, and Emily Osment play half-sisters getting to know each other; the format of the series allows for 97 more half-siblings to appear, not coincidentally matching the minimum number of episodes required to land a decent syndication deal. Executive-produced by Jason Katims (Relativity), this is a series TV fans will want to watch if only to have an opinion on it; when critics pointed out during a summer press-preview event that the doctor\u2019s actions constitute a form of rape, the panel seemed blindsided.\n\nBatwoman (CW; 10/6)\n\nSeemingly set in the aftermath of Christopher Nolan\u2019s The Dark Knight Rises, this series from Caroline Dries and Greg Berlanti takes place in a Gotham City abandoned by Batman and in danger of being overrun by dark forces. Enter Kate Kane (Ruby Rose), a.k.a. Batwoman, a street fighter and vigilante who also happens to be an out lesbian. The latter detail is particularly bold given the way non-straight characters have been marginalized in movies and TV shows cashing in on superhero mania. Batwoman was introduced in the 2018 \u201cElseworlds\u201d crossover episode of the CW\u2019s DC Comics\u2013based programs, so future crossovers are guaranteed.\n\nMr. Robot (USA; 10/6)\n\nThis apocalyptic hacker drama and social satire from Sam Esmail (Homecoming) was always up front about acknowledging its film-history references, in particular those to New York\u2013based thrillers with a strong dose of paranoia. The fourth and final season, which returns Oscar-winning star Rami Malek to his signature role as Elliot Alderson, cranks the show\u2019s meta tendencies up a notch, setting this final leg of episodes at Christmastime in the tradition of Gotham-based classics like Three Days of the Condor and The French Connection. Esmail has referred to the entire 13-episode package, shot during the summer and faked being set in winter, as \u201ca Christmas episode.\u201d The bill for tinsel, ornaments, and light strands must have been enormous.\n\nNancy Drew (The CW; 10/9)\n\nKennedy McMann stars as the \u201cgirl detective\u201d whose adventures fueled a decades-long series of mystery books, ghostwritten by a variety of authors under the pseudonym Carolyn Keene. Although the intrepid teenage sleuth hasn\u2019t been seen on American television in 40 years (where she shared a time slot with the Hardy Boys), the timing of her return couldn\u2019t be more perfect between the return of the Drew-like Veronica Mars and regular name-checks on such varied current series as Riverdale, Brooklyn 99, and Stranger Things. The executive producers include Josh Schwartz (The O.C.) and Stephanie Savage (Gossip Girl), a positive sign.\n\nTBA\n\nFor Life (ABC; fall)\n\nProduced by Without a Trace creator Hank Steinberg and Curtis \u201c50 Cent\u201d Jackson, this legal drama about a convict who becomes a lawyer behind bars was inspired by a true story. Combining journalistic grit with the structural pleasures of a network series, the show follows the hero\u2019s ongoing struggle to overturn his own unjust conviction with more self-contained stories about his representation of other inmates. 50 Cent\u2019s G-Unit was also responsible for the long-running Starz series Power, which likewise took a sincere interest in crime, prison, and rehabilitation.\n\nWhat We Think Will Be Big\n\nBy Jen Chaney\n\nSeptember\n\nUnbelievable (Netflix; 9/13)\n\nThis limited series, based on Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning investigative reporting by ProPublica and the Marshall Project, focuses on a Lynnwood, Washington, rape case in which a young woman (Kaitlyn Dever of Booksmart) is accused of lying about her attack. Not long after, a pair of Colorado detectives (Merritt Wever and Toni Collette) attempt to solve rape cases that could be connected to what happened in Washington. There are many crime shows on TV, but only this one has Susannah Grant, writer of Erin Brockovich, as showrunner, sharing directing duties with Lisa Cholodenko, director of The Kids Are All Right.\n\nThe Good Place (NBC; 9/26)\n\nThe smartest, most thought-provoking comedy on network television returns for a fourth and final season, complete with one more attempt by Michael (Ted Danson), Eleanor (Kristen Bell), Chidi (William Jackson Harper), Tahani (Jameela Jamil), Jason (Manny Jacinto), and TV\u2019s most endearing robot, Janet (D\u2019Arcy Carden), to prove that humans are capable of self-improvement.\n\nEvil (CBS; 9/26)\n\nThis new crime-horror drama from Michelle and Robert King, creators of The Good Wife and The Good Fight, has the potential to appeal to the usual CBS procedural crowd as well as those seeking TV that breaks from traditional molds. It focuses on a criminal psychologist, played by Katja Herbers of Westworld, who crosses career paths with a priest-in-training (Mike Colter of Luke Cage) and his colleague (Aasif Mandvi) who investigate possible supernatural occurrences on behalf of the Catholic Church.\n\nThe Politician (Netflix; 9/27)\n\nProlific television producer Ryan Murphy\u2019s first Netflix show is this darkly comedic portrait of a teen (Ben Platt of Dear Evan Hansen) who wants to get to the White House someday and is convinced the first step is winning his high school\u2019s presidency.\n\nOctober\n\nLiving With Yourself (Netflix; 10/18)\n\nPaul Rudd has never starred in his own scripted series, but that changes with this mind scrambler about a guy named Miles who goes to an exclusive spa that promises to make him a better person. The effects of that visit are \u2014 spoiler alert \u2014 not what he expected. In the cafeteria of Peak TV, this one would sit at the same table as The Good Place and Amazon\u2019s Forever.\n\nWatchmen (HBO, 10/20)\n\nThe brilliant comic by Alan Moore and David Gibbons, which was made into a so-so movie back in 2009, gets the TV treatment in a series that uses the source material as a jumping-off point to create its own alternate contemporary reality. Molded by creator Damon Lindelof, that reality is present-day: Regina King, who starred in Lindelof\u2019s The Leftovers, is an Oklahoma cop; there\u2019s a rising threat from a white-supremacist group whose members wear masks reminiscent of Rorschach\u2019s (the character from the comic); and Robert Redford \u2014 yeah, that Robert Redford \u2014 has been president for several years. If this is as good as it looks, this could be HBO\u2019s next big zeitgeist show. (Note: This piece has been corrected to reflect that Redford will be the president in Watchmen, but will not be a member of the cast.)\n\nNovember\n\nThe Mandalorian (Disney+; 11/12)\n\nDisney+ is another major streaming service that\u2019s launching this fall, and it\u2019s kicking off with The Mandalorian, the first-ever live-action Star Wars television series. Set in the years immediately after Return of the Jedi, the show will focus on a gunfighter in the mold of Boba Fett, portrayed by Game of Thrones and Narcos star Pedro Pascal.\n\nTBA\n\nThe Morning Show (Apple; fall)\n\nThe launch of Apple\u2019s new streaming service, Apple TV+, is going to be a major headline grabber, and this new series will be a big part of those headlines. Inspired in part by Top of the Morning, the book by CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter about the morning-TV wars, The Morning Show will follow the internal politics at a network daytime program and star some extremely high-profile actors \u2014 Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, and Steve Carell \u2014 as the talent who smile when the camera is on and snipe at each other when it isn\u2019t.\n\nThe Witcher (Netflix; fall)\n\nAnother contender in the \u201cnext Game of Thrones\u201d horse race, this fantasy-drama (based on the books by Andrzej Sapkowski that have spawned, among other things, a video-game franchise) stars Henry Cavill as Geralt of Rivia, who hunts monsters on an ancient continent divided into two kingdoms.\n\nHis Dark Materials (HBO; fall)\n\nOr could this be the next Game of Thrones? HBO\u2019s next attempt at epic fantasy is this adaptation of the beloved Philip Pullman books. It follows Lyra (Dafne Keen of Logan), a girl with special gifts, who sets out to stop a plot to secretly abduct hordes of children. Keen stars alongside James McAvoy, Ruth Wilson, and Lin-Manuel Miranda.\n\nFull Calendar\n\nFriday, September 6\n\n12 a.m. Elite, Netflix\n\n12 a.m. The Spy, Netflix\n\n12 a.m. Archibald\u2019s Next
