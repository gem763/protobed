While growing up, we work towards a certain goal and try to work very hard to fulfill that.\n\nMuch like all of us, Prathamesh too had many aspirations and he was on road to making rapid strides to achieve big things in life. At a very young age he found love in judo.\n\nIn a country like India where cricket is always the de facto sports that kids take interest in, Prathamesh took a different, challenging path of judo.\n\nA very brave kid who loved nothing more than challenges, he worked really hard and sweated it out, trying to be the best he could be at a very young age.\n\nAfter impressing with his skills and passion for the sport, Prathamesh soon was under the radar of his district sports association who rewarded his hard work with a place in the district team that played at the state-level competitions.\n\nDon't Miss 15 K SHARES 10.4 K SHARES 7.3 K SHARES 9.4 K SHARES 3.1 K SHARES\n\nMilaap\n\nAfter a very impressive showings in the state-level tournaments, he was quickly drafted into the state judo team and played quite a few nationals. Compared to other players, he was very young, but that didn't faze him from holding his own and displaying his undoubted ability.\n\nIt was all going to plan - at a young age, Prathamesh was starting to find his feet and carving out a reputation for being one of the exciting judo prospects in the country. But as has been the case on so many occasions, life can be very cruel sometimes. What was all falling in place, one moment shattered a dream that was finding its way up.\n\nDhanaji, Prathamesh\u2019s father, was working on a farm while Prathamesh was away at the sports complex for his routine practice when he received a call from Prathamesh\u2019s friends. Prathamesh had collapsed during the practice session. They asked Dhanaji to hurry.\n\nMilaap\n\nIt can't get more heartbreaking than this, and it surely is a dream crusher. An unexpected turn of events that has put a promising career at a standstill. After everything that went wrong at a training session, it was revealed Prathamesh had suffered traumatic subluxation. In simple terms, a dislocation in the cervical spine.\n\nThe spinal injury occurred in C4 and C5 sections of the spinal cord which is considered a severe condition. Due to this condition, Prathamesh\u2019s hands and legs swelled abnormally and he wasn\u2019t able to move his body. He also faced breathing complications. He underwent urgent surgery and is kept under observation at the ICU.\n\nThe 16 year-old Prathamesh had been even dreaming of working tirelessly to represent his country abroad and make a name for himself.\n\nWhile talking to Milaap, a crowdfunding NGO, his father Dhanaji said, \"He would often ask me to get him a passport saying that he would need it for international competitions. But now my son is lying on this hospital bed. And I don't have anything to save him. Nothing! \u201d\n\nIt is as sad as it can get - a very promising career being halted and put at an indefinite pause. Prathamesh was destined for a fruitful and successful career. He was looking like a player who go establish himself and achieve great things.\n\nBut the unfortunate turn of events has broken a bright dream.\n\nThere is light at the end of the tunnel, and Prathamesh is showing tremendous improvement and reacting well to the treatment. He can move his hands slightly, while the lower body is still paralysed.\n\nFor the dream and determination alone, he should win this battle too. It is a struggle, but he has shown he is a fighter.\n\nPrathamesh's dream can't die so young, he deserves another shot at life. We can only pray he gets back at it and wins the fight.", "description": "We all have big aspirations and dreams in life.
