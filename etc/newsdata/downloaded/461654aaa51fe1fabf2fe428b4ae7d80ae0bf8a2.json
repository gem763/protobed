Officers will have a Samsung Galaxy Smartphone which they can use to access dispatch alerts, notifications from gunshot detection systems, and real-time viewing and control of security cameras. Officers can then dock their phones in the car or police station to benefit from a larger screen and keyboard when entering collected evidence. All officers in Chicago\u2019s 11th should be using the DeX system by the end of the year.\n\nAt a press conference announcing the initiative, Chicago Police Department Chief Jonathan Lewin said that the main benefit of the new system is mobility. Although some of the department\u2019s previous in-car computers have been removable, officers rarely bother because of their size and weight. Now they\u2019ll be able to have their machines with them at all times. There are also potential cost benefits. One study commissioned by Samsung estimated that departments could save as much as 15 percent in the first year, and 32 percent annually thereafter, by using the system.\n\nLewin noted that \u201cthe system seamlessly takes an officer through the entire lifecycle of an incident\u201d including getting dispatch assignments while on the street, conducting name checks, vehicle checks, and beginning incident reports. He said the system also supports viewing and controlling (tilt, pan, and zoom) the district\u2019s security cameras, and can also view mapping data to see if an incident is part of a trend. It also benefits from the Android app ecosystem, and Lewin said that he expects officers to use their phones to record audio, take photos, and take notes.\n\nAccording to the Police Chief, the phones will build on the police department\u2019s existing systems like the Strategic Decision Support Centers it started investing in back in 2016. It also integrates with the department\u2019s \u201cShotSpotter\u201d gunshot detection system which is installed in 11 of Chicago\u2019s 22 police districts. In the future, there are plans to integrate the system with the department\u2019s in-car cameras, and to allow officers to contribute to reports by speaking directly into their phones.\n\nThe Chicago Police Department expects all officers in its 11th district to be equipped with the smartphones and DeX docking systems before the end of the year, as part of the pilot program. However, Superintendent Eddie Johnson noted that \u201cnearly half\u201d of all Chicago Police officers already have a department-issued Samsung smartphone.\n\n\u201dWe\u2019re by far the most advanced department in the US with technology,\u201d Lewin said, and indicated that he thought more police departments across the country could adopt the technology in the future. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see departments follow the lead of Chicago.\u201d", "description": "Police in Chicago\u2019s 11th district are trialing using Samsung DeX to replace their existing in-car computer systems.
