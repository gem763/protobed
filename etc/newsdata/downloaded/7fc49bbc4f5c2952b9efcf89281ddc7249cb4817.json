Bernie Sanders made his formal return to the race during Tuesday\u2019s 2020 Democratic presidential primary debate at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio.\n\nAnd Sanders tried to cut off CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett, one of the debate\u2019s moderators, as she tried to ask him about his health.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m healthy, I\u2019m feeling great,\u201d he said, before pivoting briefly to a question about opioids that was asked just before.\n\nSen. Cory Booker noted that Sanders is also in favor of medical marijuana.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not on it tonight,\u201d Sanders quipped.\n\nAt 78, Sanders is the oldest candidate running for the Democratic nomination. Former Vice President Joe Biden is 76 and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the third-oldest candidate, is 70. If any of them win the White House, they would be the oldest president ever inaugurated. (Donald Trump is 73.)\n\n\u201cYou are 78 and just had a heart attack,\u201d Burnett persisted. \u201cHow can you reassure voters that you are up to being president?\u201d\n\nSanders responded by inviting Burnett and viewers to a rally in Queens, N.Y., on Saturday, promising a surprise guest and vowing to continue his \u201cvigorous campaign.\u201d (According to multiple reports, the surprise guest is Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who will endorse him for president at the event.)\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders thanks those who wished him well, including his rivals, \"for their love, for their prayers\" during his recovery from a heart attack, and says he's \"healthy\" and \"feeling great.\" #DemDebate https://t.co/r4XqxLbfaP pic.twitter.com/6cf3unOFDY \u2014 CNN (@CNN) October 16, 2019\n\nThe Vermont senator, who has been reluctant to put a spotlight on his personal life, then took the opportunity to give thanks for the outpouring of support he\u2019s received.\n\n\u201cLet me take this moment, if I might, to thank so many people from all over this country, including many of my colleagues up here, for their love, for their prayers, for their well wishes,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cAnd I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart. And I\u2019m so happy to be back here with you this evening.\u201d\n\nOn Oct. 1, Sanders underwent a heart procedure after experiencing chest pains at a campaign event in Las Vegas. He was transferred to Desert Springs Hospital Medical Center, where doctors inserted two stents to alleviate an artery blockage. He was discharged from the hospital three days later. His doctors said he had suffered a myocardial infarction, or heart attack, before he was hospitalized.\n\nAfter consulting with a cardiologist upon returning to his Burlington, Vt., home, Sanders initially told reporters that he would likely scale back his campaign schedule.\n\n\u201cWe were doing [in] some cases five or six meetings today, three or four rallies and town meetings and meeting with groups of people. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to do that,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cBut I certainly intend to be actively campaigning. I think we can change the nature of the campaign a bit. Make sure I have the strength to do what needs to be done.\u201d\n\nBut in an interview with \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d the next day, Sanders said he \u201cmisspoke\u201d when he suggested he\u2019d scale back his campaign.\n\n\u201cI misspoke the other day. I said a word I should not have said and media drives me a little bit nuts to make a big deal about it,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get back into the groove of a very vigorous campaign. I love doing rallies and I love doing town meetings.\u201d\n\nThe Sanders campaign has scheduled three public events in the next two weeks: the Queens rally, a forum on criminal justice in Columbia, S.C., on Oct. 26 and a \u201cMarch to End Corporate Greed\u201d in Des Moines, Iowa, on Nov. 1.\n\nv More\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "After suffering a heart attack two weeks ago, the Vermont senator made his formal return to the race during Tuesday\u2019s 2020 Democratic presidential primary debate.
