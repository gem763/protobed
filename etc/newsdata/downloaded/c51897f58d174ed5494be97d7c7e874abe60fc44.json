Although jumped by 2.89% yesterday on the back of that the government announced on Friday, it was a very sector-specific rally that we experienced yesterday. and indices were the biggest beneficiaries yesterday as their value surged by 5.47% and 4.31% respectively. However, and indices were a big dampener, as it declined by 2.91% and 1.58% respectively.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze why we had a sector-specific movement yesterday.\n\nInvestors believe that Banking is one of the sectors that will get maximum relief from the tax cuts. Banks such as ICICI Bank (NS: ), HDFC Bank (NS: ), Kotak Mahindra Bank (NS: ), and AXIS Bank Ltd (NS: ) falls under 30%+ tax bracket, and hence are likely to benefit the most. No wonder some of the banking stocks such as HDFC Bank made 52 weeks highs yesterday.\n\nFMCG is another interesting sector in which we have seen a spurt in demand for its goods when companies reduce their prices. It had happened in the past when GST rates were reduced on FMCG products and companies passed on these to consumers in the form of price cuts. A similar thing will likely happen after the corporate tax rate cuts as it will allow the FMCG companies to pass on the savings to consumers.\n\nThe Auto sector has been in the limelight over the last few months, mainly due to news around a steep fall in sales and subsequent job losses hampering the industry. However, corporate tax rate cuts come as a significant relief to the sector, and it will mean that the auto companies can reduce the prices of vehicles to spur demand. Although the industry did not get any relief through GST rate cut, nonetheless, the corporate tax rate cut is still a big thing for the industry. Auto stocks had a nice run-up on Friday, and that continued on Monday as well. For example, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (NS: ) jumped by 4.6% yesterday after surging by 10% on Friday.\n\nThe decline in IT and Pharma stocks in a broad-based rally was a surprise yesterday. However, we need to remember that these stocks did have a run-up even when the whole market was under pressure before the tax rate cuts announcement. This is because IT and Pharma stocks depend highly on Rupee movement (see ) as these are export-oriented industries. These companies gain from Rupee depreciation. The global worries in the form of US-China trade war were taking a toll on Rupee before, but after the corporate tax rate cut announcement, Rupee has again appreciated below 71 levels against Dollar.", "description": "Shares Analysis by Investing.com (Puneet Sikka/Investing.com) covering: USD/INR, Nifty 50, Nifty Bank, Nifty FMCG.
