I bowled quite a lot for Lancashire at the start of the season and was in really good form before I got injured at an annoying time.\u201d\n\nAnderson is targeting a comeback in November during the two-match test series in New Zealand, but said he was prepared to wait until the four-test tour of South Africa in December and January.\n\n\u201cI never like looking too far ahead, I just want to get my calf sorted and look to the next series to see if I can get myself fit for New Zealand and if not, then South Africa,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nAnderson said he was also considering a vegan diet to prolong his career.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m open-minded ...
