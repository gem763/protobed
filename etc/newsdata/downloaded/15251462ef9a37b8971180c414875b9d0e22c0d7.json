Its editor, Craig Warhurst, said sorry \u201cto those of you in the community who feel let down and betrayed by the image\u201d.\n\nThe image accompanied an analysis of the federal election result in which the paper argued that the Queensland Labor leader was now in danger of losing power after her party\u2019s poor showing in the state.\n\nThe acting Queensland police minister, Craig Crawford, was among those who called the image disgraceful, particularly in the context of an epidemic of violence against women.\n\nLess cash after comment: advertisers sock it to Alan Jones after Ardern controversy | The Weekly Beast Read more\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t condone a newspaper or anybody putting anybody\u2019s head in crosshairs,\u201d he told ABC radio in Brisbane. \u201cBecause that does incite violence. To some people out there it is an invitation to shoot the premier. There is absolutely no doubt what a person\u2019s face in crosshairs means.\u201d\n\nAfter the initial complaint the the paper\u2019s deputy editor, John Farmer, told Palaszczuk\u2019s office he did \u201cnot intend to pull down the front page from online, nor apologise\u201d and offered to publish a letter.\n\n\u201cThe front page is not an attempt to incite violence against the Premier,\u201d Farmer said. \u201cThis was never our intention and it would never be at any time.\n\n\u201cWhat the front page seeks to highlight is the fact that Labor\u2019s poor performance in the federal election in Queensland means the State Government is now in the political sights of the conservative parties in Queensland. A lot of that centres around the Adani process.\u201d", "description": "Sunshine Coast Daily image \u2018had the potential to trigger violence\u2019 against premier", "authors": ["Amanda Meade"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/027ebc20bea0e44b4b8df792843371a53fb2260a/322_632_3796_2278/master/3796.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ca73c3429e8f50368089604c57e8c41f"}
