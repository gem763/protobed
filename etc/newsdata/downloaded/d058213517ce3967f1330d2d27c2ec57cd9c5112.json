Not enough for MEPs puzzled by new Commission", "language": "en", "text": "STRASBOURG \u2014 It's not just the \"European way of life\" \u2014 it's Ursula von der Leyen's way of naming other jobs that's causing trouble with members of the European Parliament.\n\nLeading MEPs said Tuesday they would urge the European Commission's president-elect to clarify posts she plans to fill \u2014 such as commissioners responsible for \"democracy and demography\" and \"international partnerships.\" They also want her to explain the absence of policy areas such as fisheries, research, culture and social policy from other job titles.\n\nThe MEPs argue that clarification is crucial to let Parliament prepare the confirmation hearings of von der Leyen's nominees, scheduled for the week of September 30. Without a better understanding of the portfolios, MEPs say, they can't decide which committees should take the lead in scrutinising nominees, who are due to take office on November 1.\n\n\"We must clarify the competence of each candidate because for now, it is not clear and her letters of mission are not clear either,\" said an official from the center-left Socialists and Democrats (S&D), the second-biggest group in the Parliament, referring to von der Leyen's letters outlining the commissioners' portfolios. \"And if that's not clear, we can't prepare the hearings.\"\n\nVon der Leyen's plan to create a vice president responsible for \"protecting the European way of life,\" whose portfolio includes migration policy, has attracted by far the most criticism \u2014 mainly from liberals, social democrats and greens. But it's by no means the only title that has caused controversy.\n\n\"I think it is extremely important for Europe to refer to our culture, and to strengthen our culture\" \u2014 Manfred Weber, EPP group leader\n\nManfred Weber, the leader of the center-right European People's Party (EPP) group, defended that position on Tuesday. But even his group, the biggest in the Parliament, is not happy with some titles proposed by fellow EPP member von der Leyen.\n\nWeber said the EPP group would ask von der Leyen to include the word \"culture\" in one of the portfolios. \"I think it is extremely important for Europe to refer to our culture, and to strengthen our culture,\" he said.\n\nWeber also said \"fisheries\" would be a more appropriate word than \"oceans\" to include in the job title of the Lithuanian nominee Virginijus Sinkevi\u010dius, who is slated to become commissioner for environment and oceans.\n\nPhilippe Lamberts, the co-leader of the Greens group in the Parliament, went further in his criticism of the portfolios, particularly the plan to create a commissioner for \"democracy and demography\" for Croatian nominee Dubravka \u0160uica.\n\n\"Well, what does that mean?\" he asked. \"That now women can make children so that there are more little white babies, preferably Christian, so we can again have better control over all these barbarians who stand at our borders?\"\n\nLamberts said that, under von der Leyen's plans, there would no longer be a commissioner with clear responsibility for social affairs.\n\n\"When you read the letters of mission, the social issue is only restricted to one question: People must have a job. What does that mean?\" he asked, adding that the EU had ambitious social policy measures to put in place.\n\nThe committee hearings for nominees will take place from September 30 to October 8, with two live-streamed sessions on the first day, six hearings a day on October 1, 2 and 3, three hearings on October 7 and the hearings of the three executive vice presidents on October 8. MEPs will then vote on the entire College of Commissioners in the week of October 23.\n\nIratxe Garc\u00eda, the leader of the S&D group, and Dacian Ciolo\u015f, the head of the liberal-centrist Renew Europe group, are expected to raise portfolio issues with von der Leyen this week. She will then meet them again with Parliament President David-Maria Sassoli on Thursday in a session of the legislature's Conference of Presidents.\n\nVon der Leyen's clarifications should allow the Parliament to prepare the groundwork for the hearings, with coordinators collecting questions from committees and sending these to the political groups' leaderships.\n\n\"There are pieces of information about certain commissioners which could be worrying\" \u2014 Iratxe Garc\u00eda, S&D group leader\n\nAs well as pushing back on some planned portfolios, MEPs say they intend to be tough with any candidate who has shown a lack of integrity. Some national delegations in the party groups have made clear that they will vote down certain controversial candidates, although it is clear party political considerations are also playing a role in their stances.\n\nThe Romanian delegation within Renew Europe has declared it will reject Rovana Plumb, the Romanian social democrat proposed as transport commissioner who was named in a corruption case in 2017.\n\nThe Hungarian delegation in the S&D group plans to reject L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Tr\u00f3cs\u00e1nyi, the Hungarian candidate for relations with the EU's neighbors who is an ally of right-wing Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n .\n\n\"There are pieces of information about certain commissioners which could be worrying and my group is going to be tough when it comes to obeying the law and meeting certain standards,\" Garc\u00eda told reporters on Tuesday. \"But of course we also have to respect the presumption of innocence.\"", "description": "Lawmakers want changes to portfolios in von der Leyen\u2019s team.", "authors": ["Ma\u00efa De La Baume", "Eddy Wax"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190916_EP-092467A_DLL_031-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
