But in his first in-person appearance with the leader he allegedly pressured to investigate his political rivals, Trump appeared more interested in matching Zelensky up with another unlikely ally: Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\u201cI really hope that Russia\u2014because I really believe that President Putin would like to do something\u2014I really hope that you and President Putin can get together and solve your problem,\u201d Trump said at the United Nations on Wednesday, as Zelensky sat stone-faced. \u201cThat would be a tremendous achievement, and I know that you\u2019re trying to do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve really made some progress with Russia,\u201d Trump added, telling Zelensky that \u201cit\u2019d be nice to end that whole disaster.\u201d\n\nThe prospect of such a friendship is, in a word, unlikely. Ukraine and the Russian Federation have been engaged in a slow-motion war since Putin\u2019s invasion and subsequent occupation of the Ukrainian region of Crimea in 2014, which has resulted in the displacement of 1.5 million Ukrainians and thousands of deaths. Speaking at the United Nations, Trump said that while he thought that Ukraine should possess Crimea, he blamed the loss of the region on President Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just one of those things,\u201d Trump said of the annexation.\n\nIn freewheeling remarks that occasionally dipped into ranting conspiracism, Trump defended himself allegations of impropriety in a July phone call with Zelensky, in which he asked the newly elected Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden, the former vice president and Trump\u2019s potential re-election opponent. In the phone call, a putative transcript of which was released on Wednesday morning, Trump offered Zelensky the assistance of personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr in his quest for dirt on Biden and his son.\n\n\u201cA lot of people want to find out about that, so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great,\u201d Trump said at the time. \u201cBiden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it... It sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nInside the Call: How Trump Pushed Ukraine to Probe Biden\n\nThat phone call\u2014as well as the existence of a whistleblower complaint filed with the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general allegedly regarding Trump\u2019s attempts to obtain information on a political rival\u2014has prompted a flood of congressional Democrats to come out in support of launching an impeachment inquiry against the president. Those efforts culminated on Tuesday evening with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announcing that she would back such an inquiry.\n\nZelensky, looking uncomfortable, issued a weak denial in response to a question about whether he felt pressured to support an investigation into Biden in exchange for hundreds of millions of dollars in congressionally appropriated military aid to the country, which Trump had withheld ahead of their phone call.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t want to be involved in democratic open elections, elections of USA,\u201d Zelensky said. Of the phone call, Zelensky called it \u201cnormal.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think, and you read it, that nobody pushed me,\u201d Zelensky added.\n\n\u201cIn other words, no pressure,\u201d Trump interjected. \u201cI appreciate the answer.\u201d\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet our top stories in your inbox every day.
