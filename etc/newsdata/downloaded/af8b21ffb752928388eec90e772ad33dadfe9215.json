(Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 A federal judge in Manhattan on Wednesday stayed for 24 hours a subpoena seeking eight years of President Trump\u2019s tax records and gave the Justice Department until Monday to decide whether to intervene in the case.\n\nU.S. District Judge Victor Marrero told the attorneys representing Trump and the Manhattan district attorney pursuing the documents that he would decide on a longer-term stay after the two sides took another day to work out some of their differences, including about the handover of documents unrelated to the tax returns.\n\nThe Department of Justice had asked the court to pause the case while it considers whether to join Trump in requesting a preliminary injunction. The case raises significant constitutional issues that the department is reviewing, the motion says.\n\nTrump is fighting a grand jury subpoena asking Mazars USA, his longtime accounting firm, to turn over federal and state tax returns from the president and his businesses. The subpoenas are in connection with Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.\u2019s investigation into hush money payments to two women who say they had affairs with Trump.\n\nIn court Wednesday, Trump\u2019s attorney, William Consovoy, argued that Vance, a Democrat, was conducting an unlawful criminal investigation of a sitting president.\n\nJustice Department policy says a sitting president cannot be indicted. Trump\u2019s lawsuit goes further, saying he cannot be subject to any criminal proceedings until out of office.\n\nAllowing such inquiries would give local authorities the power to hamstring the president and should be prohibited, Consovoy said. If Vance\u2019s office is allowed to proceed, other states may follow his lead in attempting to harass the president, he said.\n\nTrump \u201cis not subject to criminal process while he\u2019s in office,\" Consovoy said.\n\n[Trump\u2019s bank has tax records Congress is seeking in subpoenas targeting the president\u2019s finances]\n\nLegal experts say that would be a leap from existing precedent. In 1974, for instance, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that President Richard Nixon had to comply with a subpoena from investigators and turn over tapes of his conversations in the Oval Office.\n\nMarrero questioned whether Trump\u2019s argument meant that the president\u2019s businesses could not be investigated for criminal activity because the investigation could potentially implicate him in wrongdoing. \u201cHow would the district attorney know if a business is engaged in criminality if it can\u2019t investigate? What happens if the statute of limitations is about to expire?\" he said. \"Will the business get off scot-free, riding on the tails of the president?\u201d\n\nTrump is seeking sweeping immunity for himself, those close to him and his business, the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s office argued. \u201cThey have no authority for the breathtaking grant of immunity they seek,\u201d assistant district attorney Solomon Shinerock told the court.\n\nAllowing even a short stay \u201cmeans they win and we lose,\" said Carey Dunne, the general counsel for the Manhattan district attorney. The grand jury\u2019s work would be \u201cirreparably impeded by additional delay.\"\n\nSome potential charges may become moot if their statutes of limitations runs out and the case could become difficult to investigate, said Shinerock, who also argued that the matter should be litigated in state court, not federal.\n\nThe subpoenas cover \u201ca much larger bundle of documents than just tax returns\u201d and involve not just the president but also his businesses and \u201cmany\u201d third parties, Shinerock said. The documents also date back to 2011, when Trump was not in office, he said.\n\nThe district attorney\u2019s subpoena focuses on payments to Stormy Daniels, an adult-film actress, who was paid $130,000 by then-Trump attorney Michael Cohen for her silence before the 2016 election; and Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model who was paid $150,000 by American Media Inc., the publisher of the National Enquirer. Trump has denied having affairs with either woman.\n\nOn Aug. 29, a grand jury subpoenaed Mazars, the president\u2019s accounting firm, for tax records dating back to 2011, Vance\u2019s office said in its motion seeking to have Trump\u2019s lawsuit thrown out. The subpoenas are part of an effort to understand how the Trump Organization accounted for the payments to Daniels and McDougal and who was involved, the district attorney\u2019s office said.\n\nThe case is the latest in a string of lawsuits by Trump seeking to block investigations into his finances as well as those of his family members and businesses. Trump has also appealed a federal court order that cleared the way for Deutsche Bank, the president\u2019s biggest creditor, and Capital One to hand over years of financial records from Trump, his three eldest children and the president\u2019s company to two House committees. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit has heard arguments in that case but not ruled.\n\nLast week, a federal judge sided with the Trump campaign and blocked a new California law requiring presidential candidates to release five years of tax returns to run in the state\u2019s March 2020 primaries.\n\nRead More:\n\nComing to Trump\u2019s defense: An unconventional lawyer for an unconventional president\n\nTrump\u2019s bank has tax records Congress is seeking in subpoenas targeting the president\u2019s finances", "description": "", "authors": ["Renae Merle", "Reporter Covering White-Collar Crime", "Wall Street", "Deanna Paul", "Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News", "September At Pm", "Renae Merle Covers White-Collar Crime", "Wall Street For The Washington Post.
