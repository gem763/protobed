A sprawling master bedroom comes with two adjoining bathrooms and walk-in closets.\n\n\n\nPerhaps the biggest draw, though, at least for car collectors, is the house\u2019s seven-car attached garage. Visitors\u2014and owners\u2014can drive their cars up a starlight quartzite driveway and enter the air conditioned space. Inside is a 58-foot wall animation and a turntable with surround sound, according to the listing.\n\n\n\nJoel Danto\n\nAt the moment, the house is being shown with a limited edition 2019 White Aston Martin Vantage, a 2016 Ultraviolet Porsche GT3 RS, 2015 Blue McLaren 650S and a 1988 Red Ferrari Testarossa in the garage. Those cars are available to buy in a separate deal, according to a representative from Compass, the brokerage that\u2019s handling the sale.\n\nMore: Shonda Rhimes Sells Los Angeles Home for $7.16 Million\n\nThe seller is developer Essam Ali, who bought the property in 2016 for $7.5 million through his development firm Royal Excel Enterprises Corp., records show. Building permits show that he demolished the existing house and poured about $2.21 million into erecting the main house and guest house, and installing the pool, with the design guidance of luxury residential home designer Roman James.\n\nMr. Ali referred media inquiries to the house\u2019s brokers. Sally Forster Jones, Shauna Walters and Janet Muradian of Compass are all representing the house.\n\n\n\nCompleted this year, the 16,450-square-foot house comes with all of the newest home gadgets, including a security system, Lutron and Crestron lighting technology, and a Delos wellness system, which optimizes indoor air, water and light quality.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: J.K.
