(Jonathan Newton / The Washington Post)\n\nAs the Washington Capitals watched their two-goal lead against the Carolina Hurricanes dissipate in their home opener, flashes of last season\u2019s first-round playoff exit danced in the minds of the Capital One Arena crowd.\n\nHere the Capitals were, again facing a pesky Hurricanes team that failed to go away in April\u2019s series after Washington opened with two wins before falling in double-overtime of Game 7. The Capitals managed to take that seven-game misery and concentrate it into 60-plus minutes, losing, 3-2, in overtime when Carolina\u2019s Jake Gardiner beat Braden Holtby for the game-winner.\n\nGardiner\u2019s wrister past the right shoulder of Holtby clanged off the cage twice before settling into the back of the net. It didn\u2019t hurt as much as Brock McGinn\u2019s deflection that beat Holtby last spring, but it certainly stung.\n\n\u201cAnytime you have a lead, you want to keep pushing, but you don\u2019t want to push and not have support coming back,\u201d Holtby said. \u201cWe just got caught there a little bit, especially against a team that transitions so fast. That\u2019s why it\u2019s hard to protect a lead. You\u2019ve got to learn from it and get better.\u201d\n\nThe Capitals got an early power-play chance when Jordan Staal was called for hooking 19 seconds into overtime but failed to take advantage. Washington was 0 for 6 with the man advantage. The Capitals (2-0-1) have converted 18.2 percent of their power plays (2 for 11) through three games.\n\n\u201cWe just weren\u2019t sharp,\u201d forward T.J. Oshie said of the team\u2019s work with the man advantage Saturday night. \u201cWe didn\u2019t execute many plays. They did a good job of pressuring. We knew they were going to pressure; we\u2019ve seen these guys a lot. Each side is probably comfortable with the other\u2019s units, and we just didn\u2019t execute what we wanted to do.\u201d\n\nAfter offseason addition Garnet Hathaway and Oshie gave the Capitals a two-goal lead entering the third period, Carolina came roaring back with goals from forward Erik Haula and defenseman Jaccob Slavin, who knotted it with 10:10 remaining.\n\nHoltby was tested early, stopping 10 shots in the first 13 minutes and 25 of 28 overall. He faced multiple high-danger chances, including two early breakaways. One was against Sebastian Aho, who stole the puck from Alex Ovechkin at the blue line for a nifty shot that Holtby turned aside.\n\nThe Capitals have held their own without center Evgeny Kuznetsov, who was suspended for three games by the NHL for \u201cinappropriate conduct,\u201d and defenseman Michal Kempny, who is still coming back from a torn hamstring from April. Kuznetsov is expected to make his debut Tuesday at home against the Dallas Stars.\n\nAfter Saturday\u2019s game, Capitals Coach Todd Reirden acknowledged what\u2019s missing from the power play with Kuznetsov out and emphasized the need to be better once he returns.\n\n\u201cAlways disappointed to be ahead in a game like that and see us let them back in and ultimately get the extra point,\u201d Reirden said. \u201c. . . We did some good things in these three games and some stuff to grow on.\u201d\n\nThere is still no timetable on Kempny\u2019s return, and Reirden said Saturday that he wants to see Kempny do five-on-five work before making that decision.\n\nWashington will have to make some roster moves to get under the salary cap with the return of Kuznetsov. On Saturday, the Capitals continued to use the same lineup and got a strong performance from their fourth line. Hathaway, Brendan Leipsic and Nic Dowd were the team\u2019s best unit Friday night in a 2-1 win over the New York Islanders and continued that impressive play Saturday.\n\nHathaway opened the scoring by beating Hurricanes goalie James Reimer top shelf at the 17:53 mark of the first period. It was Hathaway\u2019s first goal as a Capital, and he was assisted by Leipsic, who also recorded his first point with Washington. Hathaway said the group continues to mesh but needs to work on communication, considering the three have never played together before.\n\n\u201cWe are getting a lot of chemistry right now,\u201d Hathaway said. \u201cYou could see the last few games we are building on. We are getting some momentum. It is just sticking with it, and, you know, every day you are picking up a different aspect of how the other guy plays, and I think we are just going to get better.\u201d\n\nThe Capitals signed both Hathaway and Richard Panik to four-year deals this offseason, moves that already have paid dividends.\n\nPanik slid into the third-line gap left by Brett Connolly and is contributing on both the power play and the penalty kill. Hathaway\u2019s aggressiveness and ability to create on the ice have him contributing early. Hathaway almost scored twice Saturday, but his would-be tally in the second period was waved off after a replay review determined Leipsic interfered with Reimer.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got some good material of mistakes that I think we can learn from,\u201d Oshie said. \u201cThat\u2019s a big thing early in the year, that you make those mistakes early and you can kind of nail it in and eliminate those. You never know where you\u2019d be if a couple of those mistakes in the third didn\u2019t happen.\u201d", "description": "Carolina rallies for two goals in third period before Jake Gardiner wins it in OT, 3-2.", "authors": ["Samantha Pell", "Reporter Covering High School Sports", "October At Pm", "Samantha Pell Covers High School Sports For The Washington Post.
