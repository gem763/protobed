The WhatsApp issue broke whatever they were still holding on to.\"\n\nSeveral big fires burned on main roads, as black smoke rose above Beirut's iconic blue Mohamad al-Amin Mosque and the towering St. George Church, in an apocalyptic twist to the postcard-perfect image of the country's sectarian coexistence.\n\n\"Thank god, the people have awoken,\" Rami said.\n\n'Too little, too late'\n\nProtesters were also outraged when bodyguards accompanying Education Minister Akram Chehayeb shot into the air with assault rifles earlier in the evening, a move Chehayeb later said was \"necessary.\"\n\nProtesters clash with police in downtown Beirut during protests on Thursday night [Wael Hamzeh/EPA]\n\nAs people filled the streets, Telecoms Minister Mohammed Choucair announced the reversal of the WhatsApp decision based on a request by the prime minister.\n\nBut it was too little, too late.\n\nThe country ground to a standstill, with demonstrations from Tripoli and Jbeil in the north to Baalbeck and Taalabaya in the eastern Bekaa Valley and Nabatieh and Tyre in the south.\n\nIn Nabatieh, hundreds of men headed to the homes of local parliament members, including Yassine Jaber and Hani Qobeissi of the Amal Movement - headed by Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri - and the leader of Hezbollah's parliamentary bloc, Mohammad Raad.\n\n\"Speaker Berri's appetite hasn't been satisfied in 30 years,\" one man, who identified himself as a father of two, told reporters in Nabatieh.\n\nMany were in the streets for the first time.\n\n\"We always used to follow on Facebook and social media, but now we're really fed up,\" Mohammad al-Mubayed told Al Jazeera, standing behind his wife, Sara in Beirut's Riad al-Solh Square near parliament.\n\n\"We saw people were in the streets and felt that we just couldn't stay home.\"\n\nSimilarly, 16-year-old protester Fatima had never been to the streets before, and was only 12 when the last big rallies erupted in the capital in 2015 over politicians' mismanagement of solid waste.\n\nLike many Lebanese who leave the country in search of better opportunities, Fatima and her family have been trying for years to head to Europe, but have been unsuccessful.\n\nNow, she said the protests had reinvigorated her. \"I feel like I can do something here,\" she said.\n\nDemand for change\n\nThe nationwide protests begun with just a couple dozen people chanting for revolution in Beirut's main square.\n\nFor about ten hours, protestors remained in the streets, until they were violently dispersed by baton-wielding riot police, who fired rubber bullets and shot tear gas [ Wael Hamzeh/EPA]\n\nThey multiplied into hundreds and then thousands as they marched around the capital's streets, blocking roads.\n\nFor about ten hours, protesters remained on the streets, until they were violently dispersed by baton-wielding riot police, who fired rubber bullets and shot tear gas.\n\nThe security forces also destroyed tens of motorcycles that had been parked along roadways by protestors and hit several TV cameramen covering the demonstrations.\n\n\"Now that the people are all against them, they realise that it's getting out of their control, so they've taken the decision to end it with heavy force,\" Ali, 34, said from Martyr's Square, as riot police approached.\n\nSome protesters had also lobbed stones and other objects at security forces, and grew increasingly destructive throughout the night, setting fires, destroying billboards and tearing signs out of pavements.\n\nThere was another sombre note, with reports that two men residing in a residential building in the centre of Beirut had died as a result of suffocation from a fire lit by protesters in the building.\n\nThe Lebanese Red Cross said it had rushed 22 people to hospitals and treated 70 on the ground during the protests, while the Internal Security Forces said 60 police officers were injured.\n\nAll schools, universities and banks were expected to remain closed on Friday with a new wave of protests expected.\n\n\"I'm not here for myself,\" Ahmad Halawi, 35, from South Lebanon said. \"I have two children. I'm here because I want them to have a future and a country to grow up in. I really hope that this is the end of people blindly following traditional parties. There has to be change in this country.\"", "description": "Leader of a major party suggests prime minister should resign as thousands take to the streets across the country.", "authors": ["Timour Azhari"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/18/f2a159afc84744e7b9fe8f3a0bfc1c6b_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
