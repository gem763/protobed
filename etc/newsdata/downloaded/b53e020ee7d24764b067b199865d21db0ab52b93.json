Rick Scott: We must not tolerate Iranian aggression against US or Israel", "language": "en", "text": "While I visited Israel many times when I served as governor of Florida, my most recent trip gave me a clearer perspective on Israel\u2019s proximity to its enemies: Hamas, Hezbollah, ISIS and Iran.\n\nI visited nearly all of Israel\u2019s borders and one thing is clear: Israel is a country nearly surrounded by nations and terrorist groups that want it wiped off the face of the Earth. And Iran is leading that charge.\n\nUnlike so many other nations \u2013 including many in Europe \u2013 that depend on the U.S. for military aid, Israel is a true partnership. Israel does not depend on U.S. troops on the ground and serves as a model of a well-armed democracy that fights to defend freedom.\n\nJOEL ROSENBERG: NETANYAHU IN BIG TROUBLE \u2013 WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT TUESDAY'S ISRAELI ELECTION\n\nFrankly, the United States should have this expectation of every single nation that we assist with military aid.\n\nIsrael is the only democracy in the Middle East, and our only hope for stability in the region. Israelis value human rights, support free markets and have a strong and capable military of men and women who love their country.\n\nDemocrats who want to cut funding to Israel are hypocrites \u2013 they espouse virtues like love, equality and freedom, yet they want to defund the only nation that truly shares those values in the Middle East.\n\nDuring my trip, I had the opportunity to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and I reiterated my support for his actions to block anti-Semitic members of Congress from visiting Israel last month. Now, many of these Democrats are suggesting cutting the U.S. investment in Israel.\n\nDuring my time with Prime Minister Netanyahu we also discussed the imminent threat of Iran. While Israel has a host of enemies, Iran continues to prop up the terrorist groups that surround Israel \u2013 and Iran wants Israel completely eradicated.\n\nJust look at the facts:\n\nThe Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) chief, Brig. Gen Hossein Salami, said earlier this year: \u201cIsrael will be destroyed and will not have enough graves to bury their corpses.\u201d\n\nJust last year, the deputy head of IRGC, Brig. Gen. Mohammad Reza Naqdi said: \u201cIsrael must be destroyed and wiped out.\u201d\n\nAnd Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei recently said: \u201cIsrael is a malignant cancerous tumor that must be eradicated.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s not forget, Iran displays long-range ballistic missiles with the inscription \u201cIsrael Must be Wiped Out.\u201d\n\nIran\u2019s attack last weekend on Saudi Arabian oil facilities only further shows its inability or unwillingness to be a fair and honest player on the world\u2019s stage.\n\nIran\u2019s leaders have sent a message that if they can\u2019t sell oil then no one can. That is essentially a declaration of war.\n\nThe Iranians will not stop unless they are made to stop. They have attacked the free flow of oil and commerce in their region as a direct challenge to the United States. They have attacked shipping for months now.\n\nThe Iranians mean to humble us, drive us from the region, isolate Israel, and establish a new order in the Middle East. That is an affront to U.S. national security and worldwide economic stability.\n\nIran needs to know that acts of aggression against the United States or Israel will not be tolerated. Until the United States increases pressure on the Iranians, they will continue these attacks.\n\nWe have to protect the safety and security of our military assets and our men and women in uniform in the region, as well as the security of our allies, especially Israel.\n\nMilitary conflict is not our first choice, but we must take this seriously. Every attack and every provocation unanswered by the U.S. and freedom-loving countries around the world is an encouragement to Iran\u2019s hateful and violent regime.\n\nI know there has been discussion about President Trump meeting with Iranian officials at the U.N. General Assembly next week. It is critically important to the safety and security of the U.S. and Israel that he does not make any concessions to Iran.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nIn fact, the president needs to be crystal clear on the repercussions if Iran continues making threats and taking provocative action.\n\nAs my friend Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said this week: \"The problems with Iran only get worse over time so it is imperative we take decisive action to deter further aggression by the ayatollah and his henchman.\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t agree more. Now is not the time to ease sanctions on Iran or hope that it will somehow become an honest broker.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPresident Trump was right to abandon the reckless Iran nuclear deal that President Barack Obama got us into. The sanctions the Trump administration has levied on Iran are now working.\n\nI hope European leaders will come to their senses and help the U.S. hold Iran accountable.\n\nNow is not the time to let up.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM SEN.
