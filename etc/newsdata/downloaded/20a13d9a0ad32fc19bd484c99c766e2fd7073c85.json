Shocking worker exploitation, destruction indigenous communities. Police tactics disgraceful. They sent horses right into crowd. pic.twitter.com/LfdVkosUOF \u2014 Lee Rhiannon (@leerhiannon) October 28, 2019\n\nFootage uploaded to Twitter showed mounted police using horses to attempt to break up groups of protesters who blockaded the entrance to the conference, with a 23-year-old woman taken to hospital with a leg injury after allegedly being struck by a police horse.\n\nA disgusting display of police force this morning as people peacefully protest #IMARC. Victoria is clearly joining the rest of Australia in a crackdown on the right to protest + our democracy. The Victorian Labor Government is protecting corporations rather than our communities. pic.twitter.com/6KfzRxi88X \u2014 Victorian Greens (@VictorianGreens) October 28, 2019\n\nDue to multiple injuries reported today at the #IMARC protest including suspected broken bones we are calling upon @VictoriaPolice to immediately withdraw the mounted unit from crowded protest areas and prohibit their use on future days of the protest event.@ibacVic @VEOHRC pic.twitter.com/pYlmM72xqX \u2014 Melb Activist Legal (@ActivistLegal) October 29, 2019\n\nOther footage appeared to show a police officer hitting a woman in the back with a baton while she was facing away from the officer with her hands raised.\n\nActivist legal observer group Melbourne Activist Legal Support alleged that officers had been using batons and capsicum foam to force protesters to move, not in response to any violence on the part of the protesters.\n\nDespite the crowds being loud and non-compliant, it appeared that the use of OC spray and batons was a measure to force compliance with a direction to move, rather than in response to violence or serious physical threat to police or bystanders. \u2014 Melb Activist Legal (@ActivistLegal) October 29, 2019\n\nIn a press conference, Tully said that pepper spray was used twice in the course of arrests made throughout the day. According to Tully, 50 arrests were made, the bulk of them for \u201coffences relate to obstruction of the footpath or intentionally obstructing an emergency services worker.\u201d Two arrests were made for alleged animal cruelty offences, with police accusing two protesters of having slapped police horses.\n\nProtests are expected to continue throughout the week.", "description": "Victoria Police have defended their actions after a 23-year-old woman was hospitalised in clashes with mounted police at a mining conference.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/20191029001429490821-original.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
