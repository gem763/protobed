Each has already been allocated an England Test player, and chosen two local icons.\n\nOne of Welsh Fire\u2019s icons is ex-South Africa batsman Colin Ingram, who has proved such a success with Glamorgan.\n\nThere is bound to be keen interest in the likes of UK-based players such as Simon Harmer\n\nTwenty-four of the remaining 96 places will be taken up by some of the best global short-form talent, but there is bound to be keen interest too in the likes of UK-based players like Simon Harmer and Cameron Delport, of Twenty20 champions Essex.\n\nLikewise Hampshire duo Kyle Abbott and Rilee Rossouw, plus Derbyshire\u2019s ex-West Indies fast bowler Ravi Rampaul \u2014 the Vitality Blast\u2019s leading wicket taker in 2019 \u2014 plus Holland internationals Roelof van der Merwe and Colin Ackermann.\n\nThe ECB have received in excess of 600 player applications for the competition \u2014 with both the home and overseas sections including more than 300 apiece.\n\nThe full list of names will be published on Monday ahead of next Sunday evening\u2019s event in which Trent Rockets \u2014 with England Test captain Joe Root in their ranks \u2014 get the process under way with the first pick of two rounds of \u00a3125,000 players.\n\nWorld Cup winner Mark Wood has priced himself at \u00a360,000 ahead of the draft process\n\nIn anticipation of the competitive nature of the draft process, World Cup winners Mark Wood and Liam Plunkett have priced themselves at \u00a360,000 and \u00a350,000 apiece \u2014 a player can be bought for more than their category price but not for less. Dozens of others have refused to put prices on their heads to remain as attractive propositions as possible.\n\nMeanwhile, three-time Ashes winning coach Andy Flower has left the ECB after 12 years following a reshuffle of the organisation\u2019s structure.\n\nFlower, who led England to a Test series victory in Australia in 2010-11 and home wins in 2009 and 2013, was most recently in charge of England Lions. During his five years in charge of the senior side, he also won the World Twenty20 \u2014 England\u2019s first global success.\n\nSportsmail revealed that Flower was negotiating a severance package earlier this month and confirmation of his departure came in the same week that Mo Bobat was appointed as the ECB\u2019s new performance director.", "description": "Only about 50 English cricketers are expected to be selected in next Sunday's Hundred draft, with anticipation building that nearly half of the successful candidates will be from overseas.", "authors": ["Richard Gibson For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/19/19632886-0-image-a-12_1570904539590.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
