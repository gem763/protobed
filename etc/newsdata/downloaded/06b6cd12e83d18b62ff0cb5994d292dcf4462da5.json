The first time you don't believe it.\"\n\nExplaining how they met, Shirley said: \u201cWe met on panto as friends. It didn\u2019t really take off until March\u2026 for him. I fell in love way before... I think for me it was first sight.\n\n\u201cHe was going through a difficult time in his relationship. We did become friends and then probably in about February I said, \u2018I love you Danny\u2019 and he said, \u2018I know\u2019. It took a while.\u201d\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nDaniel revealed he was going through a break-up when they first met - and Shirley offered to \"keep an eye\" on him.\n\nThings got a bit awkward when the Loose ladies starting asking when they were going to get married.\n\n\"Ask me Danny, ask me,\" joked Shirley as her red-faced boyfriend played down the idea.\n\nHe said: \"It's early days. I want to enjoy this.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nShirley also spoke about Sunday night's controversial result - with Dev Griffin and Dianne Buswell becoming the third couple to be sent home.\n\nThe head judge confessed it was difficult to send anyone home from the competition.\n\nBut she claimed the public were responsible and should have voted in stronger numbers if they wanted to save them.\n\n(Image: BBC/Guy Levy)\n\nShirley added: \"People have got to get out there and vote. we do our job. As you can see there were many people saved with lot lower scores.\"\n\n\"It's just so important...I respect everybody at home who\u2019s been watching fifteen series. Everyone has a favourite. We do our job to the best we can.\n\n\"We have to do it right there in that split second on the one minute 20 seconds. We have to make a decision.\n\n\"The three judges were unanimous. It wasn\u2019t down to me. It was unanimous and I agreed.\"\n\n*Loose Women airs weekdays on ITV at 12.30pm", "description": "The Strictly Come Dancing head judge could not stop giggling - and even asked Daniel Taylor to marry her", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Itv", "Bbc Guy Levy"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20578082.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Shirley-Ballas-gets-frisky-with-younger-boyfriend-Daniel-live-on-Loose-Women.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
