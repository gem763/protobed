I can\u2019t go in that room.\u201d\n\nWarburton, who announced his retirement from rugby last year, said he had been approached for a number of TV programmes. \u201cI was asked to go on I\u2019m a Celebrity this Christmas and I love that programme. It\u2019s the one thing I watch every time \u2026 but I can\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nHe even agreed to attend a meeting in London but got cold feet two days before, fearing he would need hypnotherapy. \u201cI said to them: \u2018I can\u2019t go on there.\u2019 I said: \u2018I\u2019m not being arrogant, it would be good telly \u2026 but for who?\u2019\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not doing it,\u201d he told the Cheltenham audience. \u201cI say this now, and then next year \u2026.\u201d\n\nWarburton retired, aged 29, having won 79 Test caps. He led Wales to a grand slam and the British Lions to a historic 1-1 Test series draw in New Zealand.\n\nMany people imagine he lives a glamorous life but he told the audience he was an ordinary guy who lived on an ordinary street, walked his dog, liked going to his local Indian restaurant and enjoyed binge-watching Friends.\n\n\u201cI think they think I\u2019m going to be at Monaco, then I went to Miami and I was doing a shoot with Vogue,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what it\u2019s like at all.\u201d", "description": "Ex-Wales captain tells Cheltenham literature festival he could never go on I\u2019m A Celebrity", "authors": ["Mark Brown"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7644f35292abdb0fbe83249dd7a7a5b60c95b849/0_150_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a29e3521c7843ad58fd04dff9aabf26f", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
