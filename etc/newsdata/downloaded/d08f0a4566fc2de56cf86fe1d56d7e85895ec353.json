Each voter is undecided, but open to voting for the leader they are across from and looking for the answers they need for a question that relates to their lives.\n\nWe invited leaders who are running national campaigns. We provided a date range in order to have them all recorded and aired in the span of one week. Mr. Bernier initially declined our offer to participate due to scheduling issues and we have since invited him for an interview later in the campaign. Mr. Blanchet was not invited as the Bloc Quebecois is only running candidates in one province.", "description": "Green Party Leader Elizabeth May sat down with five undecided voters from across the country to answer questions about how she would tackle the issues that matter most to them.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5306271.1570058524!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/the-national-presents-face-to-face-with-the-federal-party-leaders.JPG"}
