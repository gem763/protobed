His plea resolved a criminal case that became public following an FBI raid at his Las Vegas home in September 2014, U.S. Attorney Nicholas Trutanich and defense attorney David Chesnoff said.\n\nRashid won\u2019t have to register as a sex offender, both sides said.\n\nHe pleaded guilty to one charge of using an interstate facility to aid unlawful activity, Trutanich said in a statement. Rashid admitted that for more than a decade he operated escort businesses that \u201cinduced and enticed numerous women to engage in prostitution,\u201d Trutanich said.\n\nIn some instances, prosecutors said Rashid\u2019s credit card was used to pay airfare and other travel-related expenses for women he featured in advertisements for prostitution on paid websites such as Backpage and Eros.\n\n\u201cWe think this is a just resolution,\u201d said Chesnoff, speaking for his client and Atlanta-based attorney Steven Sadow. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased this matter has been resolved, as the allegations date back many, many years.\u201d\n\nA California Bay Area native, Mall has worked with a variety of artists including Tyga, Justin Bieber, Usher, and Sean Kingston. His 2013 collaboration with Tyga, \u201cMolly,\u201d reached No. 66 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Mall also was featured in the VH1 reality TV series \u201cLove and Hip Hop Hollywood.\u201d\n\nAt the same time the FBI served warrants at his million-plus-dollar home southeast of the Las Vegas Strip, agents raided his business, Las Vegas Concierge VS1, just off the Strip.\n\nA little more than two years later, in May 2016, a fire damaged the home and left an exotic pet wildcat called a caracal dead. The species is native to Africa, the Middle East, and India, and can grow to about 40 pounds (18 kilograms).", "description": "\u201cMally Mall\u201d pleaded guilty to operating a prostitution enterprise disguised as escort businesses, prosecutors and his attorneys said.", "authors": ["Breitbart News"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/JamalmallymallRashid1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
