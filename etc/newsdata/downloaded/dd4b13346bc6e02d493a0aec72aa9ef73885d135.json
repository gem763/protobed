Big mistake. And a somewhat expensive one.\n\nMust read: iOS 13: Security and privacy settings you need to tweak and check\n\nThe problem happened when I rented a car that featured Apple CarPlay. But to use CarPlay I needed a USB-A-to-Lightning cable. I only had a USB-C-to-Lightning cable (in fact, I had three, for some reason -- probably satisfying my inner hoarder).\n\nUgh.\n\nNo problems, I thought. I'll hook up my Android smartphone and use Android Auto.\n\nBut I only had USB-C-to-USB-C cables with me.\n\nDouble ugh.\n\nSo, I headed out in search of a cable, and came across one in a service station I pulled over into to use the rest room. I hastily, hungrily grabbed it and took it to the cash desk.\n\n\"$25,\" the cashier said (well, it was actually \u00a329.99, since I live in the UK, but that's close enough to $25.\n\nI blinked.\n\n\"$25, just for the cable,\" I asked, wondering if maybe there had been a mistake.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the cashier.\n\n\"That's ridiculous,\" I protested, caught somewhat off-guard.\n\n\"I know,\" said the cashier, then leaning in conspiratorially to add, \"that's the nature of these service stations. Profiting off things people have lost or forgotten.\n\nI nodded in agreement, and paid up. As I was leaving, I was muttering under my breath something about highway robbery.\n\nSo, I paid big bucks for a cable that I'd owned up to a few weeks ago, and could have, with prior forethought, picked up a replacement for off the internet for a few bucks.\n\nThe moral of the story is this; keep hold of your old cables. You never know when they might come in handy. In fact, do what geeks do, and put them in a box marked \"random cables,\" and put that box away somewhere convenient.\n\nAnd when someone asks you why you have a box of old cables, look them squarely in the eye and say, \"one day they'll come in useful.\"\n\nSee also:", "description": "In my attempts to declutter, I tossed away my old USB-A-to-Lightning cables - a big, and quite expensive mistake.", "authors": ["Adrian Kingsley-Hughes"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/08/05/c88a3a09-ace4-407b-8106-15b919d3c301/thumbnail/770x578/40cc15d3f35d8d345e4e0136b9c1a17d/006.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
