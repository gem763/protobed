I\u2019ve always said I would do that.\u201d\n\nSince the announcement of the show\u2019s return, many fans have expressed their desire to see Gretel Killeen return as host.\n\nEven former winner Reggie Sorensen told news.com.au last week, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have Gretel. She is the mother of Big Brother.\u201d\n\nKilleen refused to comment on the speculation during an appearance on Weekend Sunrise, but according to Rob McKnight from TV Blackbox, she won\u2019t be returning to the show.\n\n\u201cMy sources are telling me it\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d McKnight said on Nova\u2019s Chrissie, Sam and Browny. \u201cGretel will not be doing the show.\u201d\n\nBig Brother is coming back, and @gretelkilleen just might be hosting! \ud83d\udc40 pic.twitter.com/ujixmKMl8r \u2014 Sunrise (@sunriseon7) October 4, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s not yet known which network the Big Brother reboot will air on in 2020, but McKnight is confident it will screen on Channel 7.
