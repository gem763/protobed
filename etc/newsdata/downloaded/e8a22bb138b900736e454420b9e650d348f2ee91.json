We're the bad guys in the minds of these NBA players and coaches and their little parade of being so woke...They're doing the bidding of the shoe companies and protecting China and demonizing us and our culture and dramatically changing our culture,\" he continued. \"These guys can rail against our government, our president and be applauded for it. They don't have the courage to speak out against a communist government. All kinds of human rights violations. It's the epitome of hypocrisy and cowardice.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the NBA has sent out a league wide memo to security guards about \"political\" signs at games. Over the past two days, signs at different games were confiscated for references to \"freeing Hong Kong\" and googling the \"Uyghurs.\"\n\nH/T RealClearPolitics", "description": ".10/10/2019 14:34:00PM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Pavlich", "Guy Benson", "Julio Rosas", "Bronson Stocking", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/282/270e4897-dfe4-4044-943a-bf82f9227ed3.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
