A former senator, she was vice-presidential candidate in the 2018 election.\n\nMore:\n\nThe position of mayor of Bogota, the capital, is as the most influential political position in Colombia, after the presidency.\n\n\u201cClaudia Lopez's win in Bogota is historical on several levels,\u201d said Arlene Tickner, political science professor at Rosario University.\n\n\u201cShe will be the first woman and the first openly-gay politician to occupy the second most important elected office in Colombia, and her long-standing fight against corruption will hopefully create a battle cry that other like-minded elected officials throughout Colombia can join.\u201d\n\nSunday's elections were the first at the regional and local level since the signing of the controversial peace deal between the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), which ended a bloody 52-year long conflict.\n\nBrash and forthright\n\nLopez\u2019s brash style of speaking and strong opposition to Colombia\u2019s right-wing politicians made her popular with left and centre voters, but public opinion on her election was mixed. She won 35 percent of the vote to secure victory.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very sad,\u201d Haide Caldas, a 69-year-old Bogota shopkeeper told Al Jazeera an hour after Lopez\u2019s victory announcement. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s a good option. She doesn\u2019t seem like a person with clearly defined thoughts and her opinion fluctuates from one day to another.\u201d\n\nPia Quiroga, 44, a teacher who voted for Lopez said, \u201cIt\u2019s marvellous, we\u2019re so happy. She\u2019s going to manage the city really well and with less corruption.\u201d\n\nLopez is one of the first openly lesbian politicians in Colombia along with her partner Angelica Lozano, also a politician and member of Green Alliance. Both have advocated for LGBT+ issues in Colombia throughout their careers.\n\nJohana Rincon, 29, teacher, said as a woman and lesbian, she felt Lopez's diversity was a \"good thing for Bogota and Colombia,\u201d and 43-year-old designer Oscar Ospina said it was \u201cgreat a woman has the chance to take up the position\u201d.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a bit scandalous and overreacts a bit, but she also has a good personality,\u201d Ospina said.\n\nColombians were voting in the first regional and local elections since a 2016 peace deal. Many took their dogs with them to the polling station. [Luisa Gonzalez/Reuters]\n\nShift to left\n\nOthers see her blunt and straightforward way of doing things as refreshing.\n\n\u201cI love her,\u201d said 69-year-old jewellery seller, Lucia Garcia.\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019s fascinating. She does things heads on and what you see is what you get. I\u2019ve 100 percent faith in her and I\u2019m so happy.\u201d\n\nIn congress, Lopez once called former president Alvaro Uribe \u201ca leech running to the sewer\u201d.\n\nPerdimos, reconozco la derrota con humildad. La lucha por la democracia no tiene fin. \u2014 \u00c1lvaro Uribe V\u00e9lez (@AlvaroUribeVel) October 27, 2019\n\nUlribe, a conservative, acknowledged the strong showing of centrist and left-leaning candidates, in a tweet.\n\n\"We lost, I recognise the defeat with humility. The fight for democracy has no end.\u201d\n\nIn 2013 Lopez briefly left Colombia after receiving death threats for her research on paramilitary activity in politics.\n\nShe has long fought against corruption in Colombia and in August 2018 tried unsuccessfully to pass a citizen-driven anti-corruption bill.\n\n\n\n\u201cClaudia has been rhetorically very strong against corruption and it\u2019s likely she makes it the centrepiece of her administration,\u201d said Sergio Guzman, a political analyst.\n\n\u201cHer election is a good news story for alternative political movements for demonstrating a much stronger ideological position than traditional parties.\u201d", "description": "Left-wing Claudia Lopez is known for her straight talking approach and commitment to fighting corruption.", "authors": ["Steven Grattan"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/28/5e89d411c276453dbef98f0f4178fcc1_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
