But when they lose, they lose big.", "language": "en", "text": "However, when seniors did report losing money to a fraud, their losses were higher. People 80 and older lost the most, reporting a median individual loss of $1,700, which was more than four times the median losses of consumers in their 20s and 30s, and more than two to three times higher than in other age groups.\n\nAD\n\nThe FTC collects and analyzes consumer report information through an online database it calls the Consumer Sentinel Network. Law enforcement agencies and other organizations contribute consumer reports to the database, which is searchable by criteria such as the type of fraud. Last year, consumers reported nearly 3.1 million cases of fraud, according to the FTC.\n\nAD\n\nHere are the median losses to fraud last year, according to the FTC report:\n\nAges 20-29: $400\n\nAges 30-39: $385\n\nAges 40-49: $455\n\nAges 50-59: $508\n\nAges 60-69: $600\n\nAges 70-79: $769\n\nAges 80 and older: $1,700\n\nSeniors were scammed the most by tech support scams. Online fraud came in second.\n\nOlder adults were 371 percent more likely to report losing money on these scams than younger consumers, the FTC said. The aggregate amount older consumers reported losing on tech support scams in 2018 was nearly $21 million.\n\nAD\n\nThe FTC provides advice in this guide: How to Spot, Avoid and Report Tech Support Scams.\n\nFraudsters are getting to older adults most often by calling them. In fact, seniors were four times more likely than other consumers to be contacted by phone.\n\n\u201cThis high rate of phone fraud reporting was driven largely by reported calls from government impostors, particularly Social Security Administration impostors,\u201d the FTC report said. \u201cIn numerous instances, the scammers contacted the consumers daily, building relationships and creating trust. Frequently, large money losses occurred through multiple contacts over the course of weeks or months.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRead:\n\nAD\n\nAlthough fraudulent wire transfers still reign as the top payment preference by swindlers, gift cards are becoming the most frequently reported method of payment demanded by fraudsters.\n\n\u201cDuring the course of 2018, the number of older adults who said they paid with gift cards or reload cards increased dramatically,\u201d the FTC wrote in its report. \u201cIn fact, during the second half of 2018 (and continuing into 2019), gift and reload cards were the most frequently reported payment method by older adults, even for tech support scams. This is a concerning trend as gift and reload cards offer virtually no fraud protections for consumers. Credit cards offer the strongest fraud protections for consumers.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat\u2019s particularly sad about victimizing seniors is how it leaves them feeling.\n\n\u201cMany reported feeling a loss to their self-image as competent people with a lifetime of experience that would help them avoid being fooled,\u201d the FTC said. \u201cSome reported seeing this as proof that they were now too old to be handling their own money.\u201d\n\nYour Thoughts\n\nIf you were a victim of a scam, how have you dealt with the loss?

Something that irritates me immensely, though, is the inability to filter out HMO plans. Just not an option, while I swear it was in the past. For anyone comparing plans, I would say enter your drug(s), no matter how much you don\u2019t want to do it. My husband takes 20 plus and I hate typing in all those names, dosages, etc. But the difference is incredible; just one of his drugs could cost us $50,000 per year without any insurance. I can find only one plan where the co-pay is reasonable (under $75 a month), so of course that\u2019s the plan we will stick with. The formulary is everything, so do the homework and compare, compare, compare.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still in phase one of my review process,\u201d wrote Angie Green of Clinton, Md. \u201cSo far, it annoys me in a major way that I cannot get access to the Medicare Plan Finder on my iPad. It opens the tab and then just stops there with a blank page. Medicare should provide a solution to this problem so that those if us with six year old devices can get access.\u201d\n\nRobert Guth of Goshen, Ind., doesn\u2019t like the new Medicare Part D comparison tool. \u201cThere are two reasons,\u201d he said. \u201cOne, I am unable to rank plans by total costs, just by monthly premium or by drug charts. Total cost is the sum of the two and must both be considered. Two, the drug costs are not accurate. I entered some Tier 1 and Tier 2 drugs, and the standard drugstore cost is provided, but the preferred drugstore price is not used, so the cheapest plan is not correct if I plan to use a preferred store. My cheapest plan was several plans lower on the list, which I determined by comparing the actual formulary and the statement of changes. I am a retired health actuary, so I have enough experience to calculate this carefully.\u201d\n\nLast week, one reader suggested laminating your Medicare card to protect it from wear and tear. But others pointed out that Medicare discourages lamination of your card. I could not find any such warning on the official Medicare.gov website; however, the Social Security Administration discourages people from laminating their Social Security card because it prevents detection of many security features.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStill, one reader had a suggestion to protect your paper Medicare card. \u201cI got 10 plastic credit card size sleeves for $6 online that work perfectly,\u201d Karen wrote.\n\nAt Medicare.gov, read: 5 things to know about your Medicare card, including how to replace it should it become damaged or lost.\n\nSubscribe and stay informed\n\nIf you\u2019re viewing this post online, sign up to automatically receive Michelle Singletary\u2019s newsletters right into your email box: \u201cYour Retirement\u201d on Mondays and \u201cPersonal Finance\u201d on Thursdays\n\nRead and share Michelle Singletary\u2019s Color of Money Column on Wednesdays and Sundays in The Washington Post.
