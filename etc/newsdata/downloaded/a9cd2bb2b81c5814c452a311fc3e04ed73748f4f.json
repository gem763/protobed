Although amid the laughs is the sheepish realization that we\u2019ve all wondered at times why science can\u2019t find a way to temporarily lower the temperature of the water, a.k.a. huge swaths of the Atlantic Ocean, when a storm is inbound, to deprive it of fuel.\n\n\u201cSurely DARPA can figure out how to quickly and efficiently cool hundreds or even thousands of miles of ocean water on a few weeks\u2019 notice,\u201d I caught myself thinking yesterday before cringing.\n\nLet he who is without dopey geoengineering fantasies cast the first stone at this guy and his Navy ice flotilla idea.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s new FEMA administrator.

Jeb\u2019s state pride is understandable but is this really a \u201cFlorida man\u201d clip? That accent sounds Rhode-Island-ish to me.\n\n2. Didn\u2019t the feds actually try to do something like this once? Right, granted, it was more complicated than dropping ice and sending planes into the storm to try to counteract the hurricane\u2019s rotation, but every sophisticated failed plan \u2014 and potentially successful one \u2014 starts with a simpler thought.\n\n3. This isn\u2019t the nuttiest hurricane geoengineering idea America has heard this week, is it? At least this guy\u2019s plan would avoid showering southern Florida with radioactive fallout.", "description": "Ice, ice baby.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "Taylor Millard", "Andrew Malcolm", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/f.jpg"}
