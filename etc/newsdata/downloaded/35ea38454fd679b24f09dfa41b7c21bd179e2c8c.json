We do, so we started asking. Welcome to Why Is Your Skin So Good. Photo: Courtesy of Elisabeth Lovell\n\nWant more skin care? Join our Facebook Group, The Beauty of It All.\n\nElisabeth Leary, the founder and creative director behind salon and beauty shop WHITEROOM Brooklyn, used to \u201cattack her skin.\u201d \u201cI started a rigorous and ill-informed skin-care routine in my teens,\u201d she remembers. \u201cI started getting acne and [used] every harsh chemical under the sun. I was left with not only acne but raw, flaky, dried-out skin.\u201d\n\nThen she tried a more gentle and holistic approach. Though she explains, \u201cI won\u2019t claim to use a purely all-natural regimen. We all need a little science to help us out, especially when anti-aging is involved.\u201d Leary tries to avoid unknown ingredients like fillers, parabens, and overwhelming fragrances.\n\nShe\u2019s also learned to incorporate the counterintuitive into her routine. With combination skin \u2014 dry and oily \u2014 she was afraid of adding more oils into her rotation. To her surprise, oils and serums are what ultimately changed her skin for the better. She says of one in particular, \u201cNothing has ever made my skin look so nourished and luminous.\u201d Read on for the holy grail product \u2014 and why it\u2019s worth its $185 price tag.\n\nGrown Alchemist Hydra+ Oil-gel Facial Cleanser \u201cI like to double cleanse at night to thoroughly remove the makeup and grime from the day. An oil cleanser on its own doesn\u2019t feel like it gets my skin totally clean, but I start with one to break up what is on my skin. I like the Grown Alchemist as an oil cleanser in particular because it is a lighter formula that slightly foams up and rinses off pretty clean.\u201d $65 at Amazon Buy $65 at Amazon Buy\n\nDr. Loretta Micro-Exfoliating Cleanser \u201cThis is is a gentle exfoliant. It has a light gel consistency and I think it is most effective when left on for three to five minutes. If left to sit, you will start to feel a slight tingle, but nothing too abrasive. It contains 2 percent salicylic acid, which gently exfoliates, detoxifies, and removes dead skin cells. It also contains coconut oil which hydrates and nourishes the skin.\u201d $35 at Dermstore Buy\n\nGrown Alchemist Balancing Toner \u201cI apply this after cleansing to rebalance my skin. It brings the skin back to its natural pH after cleansing and prepares the skin to properly absorb moisturizer. Rose and chamomile also calm the skin and reduce redness after cleansing. After applying, I definitely feel like my skin absorbs my serums and moisturizers better, and overall looks softer and brighter. When I don\u2019t tone, it takes a bit longer for everything to absorb and my skin doesn\u2019t feel as soft to the touch.\u201d $34 at Goop Buy\n\nVintner's Daughter Active Botanical Serum \u201cI learned about Vintner\u2019s Daughter through all the amazing press they were getting when the product first came out. When they reached out to me about carrying them at WHITEROOM, I was excited to try the product. I immediately placed an order after seeing how good my skin looked after using it for only a couple of days. The holy grail of facial serums, this oil contains 22 whole plant, cold-pressed botanical ingredients. Nothing has ever made my skin look so nourished and luminous. I am for sure a believer.\u201d $185 at Violet Grey Buy $185 at Goop Buy\n\nSkin Gym Black Obsidian Facial Roller \u201cRolling reduces puffiness and increases circulation. I roll in an upward motion and around my eyes to help de-puff. I\u2019m not sure I actually notice a huge difference, but it feels good, and I do think my skin feels softer after doing it.\u201d $68 at REVOLVE Buy\n\nJoanna Vargas Revitalizing Eye Cream \u201cJoanna Vargas is a well-known facialist who has a studio in New York, along with her own line of skin-care products. I learned about her line through friends who had gotten facials there and loved the products. I often avoid eye creams because they don\u2019t feel like they fully absorb, are heavy, and make my makeup run. I like this one because it is lightweight. I never look in a mirror half way through the day and find myself looking like a raccoon. This eye serum also allegedly reduces puffiness and improves elasticity.\u201d $75 at Dermstore Buy\n\nVerso Lip Serum \u201cSleeping in this treatment keeps my lips hydrated and even a little plumper when I wake up.\u201d $65 at Dermstore Buy\n\nJoanna Vargas Daily Hydrating Cream \u201cI wear this moisturizer day and night because it is super-moisturizing but not too heavy or greasy. All of the ingredients in this line are naturally derived. This moisturizer contains galactoarabinan, which is a plant collagen derived from the larch tree that allegedly promotes cell turnover.\u201d $75 at Dermstore Buy\n\nVerso Intense Facial Mask \u201cOnce a week, I will use the Joanna Vargas exfoliating mask (below) and follow it up with a Verso sheet mask. It is the most hydrating, softening mask I have ever used. I make sure I have one or two with me when I travel. It brings everything back to life after a long flight. This sheet mask contains something called Artificial Moisture Factor, which allegedly supports the skins ability to retain moisture. The effects can reportedly last up to 120 hours, and your skin will be noticeably softer and more hydrated. I have noticed that when I use the Verso mask my skin does look more dewy and plumper for at least two days. The hydration it offers I think lasts for closer to three or four days even after the other effects have worn off.\u201d $80 at Barneys New York Buy\n\nJoanna Vargas Exfoliating Mask \u201cThis mask is a super-grainy clay mask that has volcanic ash to draw out impurities. I apply it to clean skin, let it dry fully, and then rehydrate with water and use the grainy texture to scrub and exfoliate further. I only use this once a week.\u201d $75 at Dermstore Buy\n\nIf you buy something through our links, New York may earn an affiliate commission.\n\nStay in touch.
