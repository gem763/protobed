Justice Department officials said Frese did so in an effort to \"curry favor\" with the journalist, and that he hoped it would benefit the other journalist's career with whom he was allegedly romantically involved.\n\nOfficials declined to identify the foreign country about which they say Frese disclosed information regarding their weapons systems, as well as the two journalists to whom he allegedly leaked information. Regarding the privacy concerns of the journalists, U.S. Attorney Zachary Terwilliger said that the surveillance warrant was specifically targeting Frese and not the phones of the journalists.\n\nA grand jury approved an indictment Tuesday charging Frese with two counts of transmitting national defense information to unauthorized persons, and could face a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison on each count, according to a press release.\n\nProsecutors note Frese is presumed innocent unless proven guilty. He is expected to appear in court Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThis is a developing story.
