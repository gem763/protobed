You cannot fall off of a ship unless you are acting like a moron!\u201d Blosic said in a social media post obtained by the Sun.\n\nBlosic then claimed that he immediately went to guest services, and officials on the ship soon tracked the woman down.\n\n\u201cI showed the concierge. The staff captain then wanted to meet with me and get a copy of the photo. We easily determined the cabin number since it\u2019s on the hump,\u201d he said.\n\nRoyal Caribbean\u2019s guest conduct policy states that \u201csitting, standing, laying or climbing on, over or across any exterior or interior railings or other protective barriers, or tampering with ship\u2019s equipment, facilities or systems\u201d is forbidden for the safety of all passengers.\n\nFailure to adhere to the rules may result in ship security, law enforcement intervention, and ultimately removal from the ship.\n\nThis is not the first time Royal Caribbean has had to ban a passenger for life. In January, a cruise passenger on a Royal Caribbean cruise ship docked in Nassau in the Bahamas jumped from the 11th-floor balcony and was ordered by ship security to pack up his things and leave the ship for good.", "description": "A Royal Caribbean passenger has been banned for life from sailing with the cruise liner after risking her life to take a selfie.", "authors": ["Katherine Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/cruise-ship-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
