Through the suit, he\u2019s trying to force the disclosure of these people\u2019s names, something that would have profound implications for every part of the internet where anonymity is the norm.\n\nThere are many ethical ambiguities in the media men list, a clearinghouse for anonymous allegations where someone wrote that \u201crape accusations\u201d had been made against Elliott. While Elliott told my colleague Bari Weiss that he has, in the past, been \u201cunaware of boundaries and transgressed them without realizing,\u201d he insists he is innocent of rape, and has no way to clear himself of an anonymous charge that has ruined his life. If this is true, he deserves sympathy.\n\nDonegan, however, didn\u2019t write the allegations against Elliott. And his suit attempts to use her fiery feminism against her, saying she has a \u201cwell-documented history of publicly publishing statements professing a hatred of men.\u201d Seeing this, any woman who contributed to the list \u2014 or merely forwarded a link to it \u2014 might feel the need to temper her anger at the patriarchy online.\n\nDuring the civil rights era, Southern segregationists waged what Elena Kagan once called, in her pre-Supreme Court days, a \u201ccampaign which intended to curtail media coverage of the civil rights struggle\u201d through libel lawsuits against journalists. That became more difficult with the 1964 Supreme Court decision New York Times Company v. Sullivan, a case involving a full-page ad in The Times, paid for by the Committee to Defend Martin Luther King and the Struggle for Freedom in the South, that contained factual errors. The court\u2019s decision required people claiming libel to prove \u201cactual malice,\u201d not simply untruths.\n\nRoberta Kaplan, a renowned feminist lawyer who is now representing Donegan, told me that after Sullivan, it became conventional wisdom that defamation lawsuits aren\u2019t \u201crational or appropriate ways to settle disputes about truth or falsity, except in really exceptional circumstances.\u201d", "description": "Angry men go to court to silence their critics.", "authors": ["Michelle Goldberg"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/22/opinion/22goldberg4/22goldberg4-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2018-10-22"}
