An official told the newspaper there was no evidence of improper behaviour by the president.\n\nAccess to a transcript of at least one conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin was also curtailed.\n\nIt is unclear if notes on these calls were placed in the classified information storage system.\n\nWhat is the impeachment inquiry about?\n\nThe proceedings focus on the phone conversation Mr Trump had with Mr Zelensky on 25 July.\n\nIn a complaint filed last month, a whistleblower from the intelligence community reported his \"urgent concern\" that the president had used his office to \"solicit interference from a foreign country\" in the 2020 US election.\n\nA rough transcript of the conversation, released by the White House this week, shows that the president urged his newly elected Ukrainian counterpart to investigate discredited corruption allegations against Mr Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption US citizens react to the latest developments\n\nDemocrats accuse Mr Trump of illegally seeking foreign help in the hope of smearing Mr Biden - a frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nMr Trump is also accused of using military aid for Ukraine as a bargaining tool.\n\nPresident Trump has dismissed the proceedings as a \"hoax\" and \"another witch-hunt\". On Saturday he accused leading Democrats of \"presidential harassment\" and branded them \"Democrat Savages\".\n\nOn Friday, three House committees subpoenaed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for documents about the administration's dealings with Ukraine.\n\nKurt Volker, US special envoy to the country, resigned on the same day.", "description": "Officials limited access to notes on the president's calls to some foreign leaders, US media report.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4CEA/production/_109009691_tv056865336.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
