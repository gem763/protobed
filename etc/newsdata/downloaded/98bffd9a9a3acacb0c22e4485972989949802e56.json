The hearing is testing evidence about how another businessman, Nigel Elias, acquired $8.5 million shares in Affinity. Mr Elias has not been charged.\n\nThe court on Thursday saw Ms Hutson\u2019s lawyer Neil Clelland, QC, questioning Mathew Bastianon, a senior lawyer with ASIC\u2019s corporations and corporate governance team.\n\nAsked how Ms Hutson had become the primary target of their investigations, Mr Bastianon said that a referral had come to ASIC\u2019s enforcement division after the Takeovers Panel had made findings about parties who had bought shares during the attempted takeover.\n\n\u201cThose associations included links between Ms Hutson and various other persons in relation to the purchases that were undertaken by entities,\u201d Mr Bastianon told the court. That included Mr Elias\u2019 private company West Bridge, he said.\n\n\u201cOne of our lines of inquiry was to see if there was any link between Ms Hutson and any of those acquisitions,\u201d he said.\n\nTurning point\n\nMr Bastianon said a key moment was probably when Mr Elias told ASIC that Ms Hutson had asked him to incorporate a company for the purpose of purchasing shares in Affinity. \u201cAt that point in time, a direct connection was made to Ms Hutson,\u201d he said.\n\nHe estimated ASIC had issued about a dozen notices for compulsory examination under ASIC\u2019s powerful Section 19 powers. The court also heard five search warrants had been executed on one morning in August 2016, including a 6.50am raid on a home in Brisbane's Red Hill that Ms Hutson had listed as her address.\n\nHe was repeatedly questioned about any inconsistencies between initial evidence from witnesses and subsequent official statements to ASIC.", "description": "The star corporate lawyer is defending charges brought by the regulator.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3659%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_174%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a4374722a698e3bb02bcef2a4267ccc1b22a040d", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
