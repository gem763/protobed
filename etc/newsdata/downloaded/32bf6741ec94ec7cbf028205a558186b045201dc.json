Mattis Has Some Thoughts About Trump's 'Bone Spurs'", "language": "en", "text": "Jim Mattis hasn\u2019t said much publicly since he stepped down as President Trump\u2019s defense secretary last December, but he had plenty to say Thursday night \u2014 at Trump\u2019s expense.\n\nThe decorated Marine Corps general, speaking at a black-tie dinner in New York in his first public remarks since departing his government post, certainly could have focused on the president\u2019s military or foreign policy blunders and scandals, of which there are many, past and present. But instead, Mattis delivered a string of one-liners roasting Trump for everything from his evasion of the draft to his well-documented love of golf.\n\n\u201cI earned my spurs on the battlefield. Donald Trump earned his spurs in a letter from a doctor,\u201d Mattis said Thursday referring to Trump\u2019s admission that he managed to avoid serving in Vietnam because a doctor diagnosed him with bone spurs in his feet.\n\nMattis later quipped, \u201cA year according to White House time is about 9,000 hours of executive time, or 1,800 holes of golf.\u201d (Conservative estimates peg the cost of Trump\u2019s golf habit to taxpayers at $100 million.)\n\nIt was just a day after Trump called Mattis the \u201cworld\u2019s most overrated general,\u201d and Mattis had to acknowledge the superlative.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m honored to be called that by Donald Trump, because he also called Meryl Streep an overrated actor,\u201d Mattis also said on Thursday night. \u201cSo I guess I\u2019m the Meryl Streep of generals.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not just an overrated general. I\u2019m the greatest, the world\u2019s most overrated,\u201d he said, mocking Trump\u2019s proclivity for hyperbole.\n\nMattis left the Trump administration in December after nearly two years as the defense secretary \u2013\u2013 a healthy stint, compared to how quickly other Cabinet officials have fled their posts.\n\n\u201cI had no choice but to leave,\u201d Mattis said after retiring. His confidantes have told reporters that Mattis found the president tactically unskilled and personally difficult to like. Late in his time at the Pentagon, Mattis and Trump began to clash more frequently over defense strategy, and as early as 2017, Mattis was caught on film hinting at the Trump administration\u2019s dysfunction to U.S. troops stationed in Jordan.\n\n\u201cOur country right now, it\u2019s got problems we don\u2019t have in the military,\u201d Mattis said at the time. \u201cYou just hold the line until our country gets back to understanding and respecting each other and showing it.\u201d\n\nCover: Former U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, center, delivers the keynote address during the 74th Annual Alfred E.
