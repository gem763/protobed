Now the teachers for the nation's third-largest school district want the city's government to do more to lower housing costs and put more resources into helping homeless students. The demand for affordable housing citywide -- for students and their financially-strapped families as well as for school employees -- is a departure from previous civil strikes. This new stance is part of the union's \"social justice\" agenda.\n\nMORE ON FOX BUSINESS . . . CHICAGO BECOMES FIRST MAJOR CITY TO COLLECT 'NETFLIX TAX'\n\nOn Monday the 25,000 members union flatly rejected Mayor Lori Lightfoot's request to return to classrooms while contract talks continue.\n\nNeither side has spoken publicly about any discussion of the affordable housing issue during bargaining sessions. But the union has made clear that the issue is an important one for its membership.\n\nChicago is certainly not the only U.S. city where the issue of affordable housing for teachers and other school employees is significant. But Robert Bruno, a professor of labor and employment at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, said he doesn't know of any other cities in which the issue has pushed its way into contract negotiations.\n\nHe said that's because the chasm continues to grow nationwide between teachers' salaries and the cost of affordable housing at a time when urban school districts also are having an increasingly difficult time recruiting and retaining teachers.\n\n\"Teacher unions around the country are watching this very closely,\" Bruno said.\n\nThe Chicago union hasn't released details of its housing proposal -- and it's unclear what changes, if any, such language would require of the city.

They've also referenced approaches to help teachers used elsewhere, including a California school district that's building affordable housing for teachers and a Colorado program that covers a portion of teachers' down payment for a home.\n\nTeachers also want more staff dedicated to helping students who are homeless and working with families that are close to losing their housing. The union announced some progress on that issue Sunday night, but exact details haven't been released.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Affordable housing among striking Chicago teachers' demands", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/chicago-teachers-AP.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
