He was shivering and drenched from the dirty water.\n\nPiengkamol has been taking care of him for the last week but the dog, which she has nicknamed 'Luck', still refused to eat.\n\nInstead, he woke up in the morning and waited on the edge of the jetty, looking out over the water with a sadness in his eyes and hoping that his owner will return.\n\nEvery time a boat passed by, 'Luck' bounded to the end of the pier expecting to see someone - but each time the boat passed by without stopping.\n\nPiengkamol said the sad dog has stayed in the same position and refused to go anywhere else.\n\nShe said: ''He fell from the boat that was riding past my house.
