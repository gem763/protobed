Terms weren\u2019t disclosed.\n\nBeyond releasing a crush of superhero movies for the big screen in recent years, Disney has also expanded its Marvel universe beyond theaters with new programs for broadcast TV and its coming Disney+ streaming service.\n\n\u201cWe believe audio is the next natural step to bring the Marvel Universe to fans around the world,\u201d said Marvel Entertainment President Dan Buckley in a statement. The company\u2019s \u201cAvengers: Endgame\u201d is the highest-grossing film of all time.\n\nThe deal marks SiriusXM\u2019s first major foray into creating podcasts and signals a bet that exclusive content will bring more listeners to its subscription service, which costs $8 to $21 a month, and the free, ad-supported Pandora.\n\nThe multiyear deal will kick off in 2020 with four new scripted series based on the Wolverine, Hawkeye, Black Widow and Star-Lord characters, and a fifth series in which all four team up. The companies also plan to develop unscripted podcasts examining Marvel history and regular talk shows, including an interview segment featuring celebrity guests.\n\nAny shows created under the agreement will begin as exclusive to SiriusXM and Pandora services.\n\nScott Greenstein, SiriusXM\u2019s content chief, says Marvel appeals to a broad range of consumers and pointed to its success across media, from comics and theatrical releases to its partnership creating original series for Netflix Inc.\n\n\u201cWhen they go into an area deep, they generally do make a difference,\u201d he said.\n\nMusic-streaming services have been turning to podcasts to better compete with radio for share of listening time and to improve margins. Spotify Technology SA acquired three podcast companies this year and struck a deal with the entertainment-production company started by Barack and Michelle Obama to develop and produce podcasts exclusive to the streaming service. Radio companies, too, including iHeartMedia Inc., Entercom Communications Corp. and PRX have been expanding their podcast efforts as well.\n\nEarlier this year, SiriusXM made available clips from some of its most popular talk shows to Pandora as podcasts to increase nonmusic audio content on the music-streaming service. SiriusXM has waded into the medium with a similar approach to its satellite radio service, focusing on big brands and talent. Examples include joining with LeBron James and Maverick Carter\u2019s company Uninterrupted to produce \u201c17 Weeks,\u201d a weekly football podcast that is distributed widely, and with the 90s rap group Wu-Tang Clan to produce a podcast that accompanied Hulu original series \u201cWu-Tang: An American Saga.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s approach has also meant being selective. Unlike other services like Apple Inc. \u2019s Podcasts, iHeart and Spotify that have built up vast libraries with tens or hundreds of thousands of podcasts, Pandora\u2014with around 5,000 podcasts\u2014has attempted a more curated approach with a focus on recommendations.\n\nU.S. ad revenue from podcasts climbed 53% to $479 million last year, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. It is expected to rise to $678.7 million this year and to top $1 billion by 2021. Among the U.S. population over 12 years old, the share of people who have ever listened to a podcast topped 50% last year, according to Edison Research, while an estimated 90 million\u2014or 32% of the population\u2014are monthly podcast listeners.\n\nWrite to Anne Steele at Anne.Steele@wsj.com", "description": "Coming soon to a podcast near you: superhero stories.
