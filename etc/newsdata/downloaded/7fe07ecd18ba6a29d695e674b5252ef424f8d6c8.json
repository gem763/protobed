Take Mithali Raj\u2019s case. Recently, she completed 20 years in international cricket\u2014a feat that is Sachin Tendulkar is the only other Indian to accomplish, but the comment section on Twitter was still stuck at which language she prefers to converse in. Can we please move on?\n\nIn a recent Twitter brawl, you would\u2019ve noticed Sachin congratulating the captain for guiding the team to a sweeping 3-0 victory over South Africa. It coincided with her achievement which even the God of cricket noticed. Mithali seemed to be over the moon as she replied to the glorious tweet. \u201cIt feels nice to be acknowledged by a person who I have looked up to all my life .. thank you champion\u201d, she wrote. However, as usual, there appeared a wild troll going by the handle, Sugu, who commented, \"She doesn't know Tamil. She will speak in English, Telugu, Hindi.\" When the world is appreciating talent, why not ruin everyone\u2019s mood by picking a personal battle of language preference? Mentality of a troll decoded 101.\n\n\u0ba4\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bcd \u0b8e\u0ba9\u0bcd \u0ba4\u0bbe\u0baf\u0bcd \u0bae\u0bca\u0bb4\u0bbf..\n\n\u0ba8\u0bbe\u0ba9\u0bcd \u0ba4\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bcd \u0ba8\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0bb1\u0bbe\u0b95 \u0baa\u0bc7\u0b9a\u0bc1\u0bb5\u0bc7\u0ba9\u0bcd..\n\n\u0ba4\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0ba9\u0bbe\u0baf\u0bcd \u0bb5\u0bbe\u0bb4\u0bcd\u0bb5\u0ba4\u0bc1 \u0b8e\u0ba9\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1 \u0baa\u0bc6\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bc8.. but above it all I am very proud indian ! Also my dear sugu ,you constant criticism on each and every post of mine ,you day to day advice on how and what should I do is exactly what keeps me going https://t.co/udOqOO2ejx \u2014 Mithali Raj (@M_Raj03) October 15, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, I would like to dedicate @vasugi29 a very famous song by a strong independent woman I admire a lot . Enjoy :) https://t.co/o34CtfCZCB \u2014 Mithali Raj (@M_Raj03) October 15, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nMithali, though, was not having any of it. She was quick to reply in Tamil, showing him exactly the place he needs to be. \u201cBut above it all I am very proud Indian! Also my dear Sugu, you constant criticism on each and every post of mine, your day to day advice on how and what should I do is exactly what keeps me going,\" she wrote. We thank god for the masterclass in badassery Mithali just exhibited, because someone needs these trolls to understand just how pointless their opinion is.\n\nThis isn\u2019t an uncommon practise in today\u2019s internet world. Mostly all celebrities are trolled incessantly for their choices\u2014sometimes even crossing the line between moral policing and downright sexism. From Malaika Arora Khan, Parineeti Chopra to Disha Patani and Ananya Panday\u2014 there is hardly a name in the industry or outside who has not been subjected to the crazy trolling. At least we can thank the celebs who take the time out to actually teach them a lesson because it must be hard to deal with it on a constant basis . The next time you spot a troll doing the nasty deed on a celebrity profile, make sure you call it out. If we don\u2019t, they might actually start believing women need to be policed. Even on the internet!", "description": "Another day, another celebrity trolled. This time it\u2019s Indian women\u2019s cricket team captain, Mithali Raj who recently completely 20 years in the industry. Yet, we see them trolls not being able to handle it in the comment section!", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://im.idiva.com/content/2019/Oct/iDiva_Mithali-raj_Social_5da71e0908db1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
