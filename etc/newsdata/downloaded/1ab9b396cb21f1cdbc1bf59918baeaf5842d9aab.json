The decision is expected to be formalized through a written procedure.\"\n\nThe term flextension means that the U.K. will be able to leave earlier if the Brexit deal secured by Prime Minister Boris Johnson is ratified before Jan. 31.\n\nTusk's announcement came as European Union diplomats met in Brussels to sign off on the new delay for Britain's departure, which had been on Oct. 31.\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson, like his predecessor Theresa May, has struggled to get a deal through Parliament.
