He stood with his new national security adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, named earlier in the day to replace John Bolton, ousted Sept. 10.\n\nO\u2019Brien has served since spring 2018 as the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs. He helped secure the release of Christian pastor Andrew Brunson from a Turkish prison. Earlier this year, O\u2019Brien took the lead in achieving the release of American rapper A$AP Rocky from a jail in Sweden.\n\nTrump said O\u2019Brien has \u201cbrought a lot of people home.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s worked with me for quite a while now on hostages, and we\u2019ve got a tremendous track record with respect to hostages,\u201d Trump said.\n\nO\u2019Brien, a lawyer, told reporters he expects continued foreign policy success with the Trump administration, and praised the president\u2019s foreign policy team.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "But will it be sanctions or war?", "authors": ["Fred Lucas"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XXEQn1ChhQdwxe3YeL_EWw--~B/aD05NjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/491f7f4160fa17658732de0c8b1d1a62", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
