It was also reported that some of the suspects operate using vehicles. Mostly cellphones and money are stolen.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe would like to encourage the public to refrain from walking alone and please avoid dark areas. Learners should also walk in groups,\u201d says Theunis.\n\nRobberies occur when cellphones are made visible, he explains.\n\n\u201cWe urge the public to refrain from listening to music on their cellphones. Earphones indicate that people are in possession of cellphones.\n\n\u201cPeople should not create an opportunity to become victims of crime.\u201d\n\nTheunis says theft out of motor vehicles often happens when valuable items are left visible. \u201cOne modus operandi is where remote jamming is used to break into vehicles.\n\n\u201cOwners or drivers should ensure that their vehicle is locked when using a remote control.\n\n\u201cPeople are still leaving valuables like laptops, cameras and cash in their vehicles. This creates opportunities for thieves to break into their vehicles.\n\n\u201cWe would also like to urge the community to report suspicious actions and people and to please write down registration numbers of vehicles that were involved in criminal activities,\u201d he adds.", "description": "There has been an increase in robberies and theft out of motor vehicle incidents in Goodwood.", "authors": ["Tarryn-Leigh Solomons"], "top_image": "http://graph.facebook.com/1470345243209060/picture", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
