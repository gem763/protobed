But that\u2019s a scenario I\u2019ve been forced to imagine thanks to \u201cbad 1d imagines,\u201d a Tumblr blog (and Twitter account) that brings together all the worst One Direction memes and micro fan fiction posts from across the web into one heinous wall of horror.\n\n\u201cImagines\u201d are a popular form of fan fiction, structured as an image macro \u2014 usually just a photo and a simple prompt to help you imagine a situation. It\u2019s common for them to have \u201c(Y/N)\u201d in them, which is a fill-in-the-blank for \u201cyour name.\u201d There are literally thousands of these featuring images of One Direction, which should come as no surprise. And, I suppose, given the range of the English language and the unplumbed depths of the human imagination, it should also be no surprise that many of these are super weird, incredibly violent, or both.\n\nI love them.\n\nA lot of fan fiction is poorly written, and that is because most people are not good at writing fiction. But it\u2019s not a big deal because you don\u2019t really need to be talented at the craft of writing in order to create an enjoyable fantasy for yourself. For example: \u201cImagine... Harry Styles smooches you on the cheek real polite and then hands you a library card you lost 18 months ago.\u201d Wow, nice.\n\nIt\u2019s sort of like how you don\u2019t need to be an expert baker to make an enjoyable cake. It\u2019s cake! It\u2019s pretty much going to be fine unless you go really crazy, and in that case you end up with the cake-equivalent of this:\n\nThe best thing about \u201cbad 1d imagines\u201d is that it\u2019s all submissions and images ripped from other blogs or Instagram accounts \u2014 the 20-year-old operator of the blog says they don\u2019t make anything themselves. Some of the posts seem sincere, some are plainly parody, and some are honestly disturbing no matter how they were intended. The submissions process follows the What Not to Wear rules of entry, meaning that any Tumblr user submit on behalf of any friend, acquaintance, or total stranger.\n\nYes, that process is a little mean. But nobody ever said the art world was all kittens and roses, and nobody in their right mind would deny that these memes are art.\n\nThe only way i wanna go <3 pic.twitter.com/E2aLhbWffT \u2014 bad 1d imagines (@BAD1DIMAGlNES) January 25, 2016\n\nK then pic.twitter.com/WyS0H0ylSN \u2014 bad 1d imagines (@BAD1DIMAGlNES) November 27, 2015\n\nOne Direction is one of the most important things that has ever happened to the microblogging platform Tumblr. Even though the band no longer exists, GIFs of their old concerts, conspiracy theories about their young children, and paparazzi shots of their afternoon iced tea runs in Calabasas are essential to the fabric of the site. Over a year into the group\u2019s indefinite hiatus, they\u2019re as powerful a presence on the platform as they ever were.\n\nAnd in particular, fan fiction about the four (at one point, five \u2014 RIP Zayn) members of the band is still incredibly popular. As per Tumblr\u2019s weekly fandom metrics, the group is still regularly among the top 20 musical acts on the site, and when the site published a comprehensive report at the end of last year, One Direction was the third most popular topic for fan fiction. The synapse-razing images embedded in this post are barely a fraction of a percent of a snapshot of a sample of what\u2019s out there.\n\nSo it\u2019s nearly impossible to imagine One Direction ever leaving us completely, and it\u2019s easy to imagine being brutally murdered or maimed by a member of One Direction.\n\nWTF HE GONNA DO WITH THEM THOUGH pic.twitter.com/gbAEoo52GX \u2014 bad 1d imagines (@BAD1DIMAGlNES) September 1, 2015\n\nYou can vote in this poll if you want, but it\u2019s really just for show.", "description": "It happens to everyone: you\u2019re dead and you\u2019re a ghost and your famous boyfriend Niall Horan of the famed British boy band One Direction won\u2019t stop singing love songs to you because he is so cute...", "authors": ["Kaitlyn Tiffany", "Apr"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S_A1Z7BMl_MQ2iA8ebD0v6jAWFc=/4x164:500x443/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/54210271/bad_1d_imagines_niall_ear.0.jpg", "published_at": "2017-04-12"}
