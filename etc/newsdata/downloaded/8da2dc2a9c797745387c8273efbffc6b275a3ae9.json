With the U.S. coming into the picture, there is a choice, there are options for the consumers, better for energy security, for diversification.\"\n\nFracking advocates say it vastly increases natural gas supply \u2014 a cleaner fuel than crude oil \u2014 and cuts costs for consumers.\n\nNatural gas mining and extraction employs more than 162,000 workers in the U.S., according to 2019 figures from the Energy Futures Initiative and the National Association of State Energy Officials. More than 625,000 Americans work in the wider natural gas industry.\n\nThe Turkish energy expert and economist maintained, however, that climate change is a real concern and warrants commitment to finding solutions that involve the oil and gas industry, rather than exclude it. Climate and environmental scientists also point to the polluting effects of fracking, which has led to earth tremors and contaminants leaking into groundwater.\n\n\"I think climate change is serious issue \u2014 the oil industry, gas industry have to be part of the solution rather than being the problem or a barrier,\" he said.\n\n\"But stopping oil and gas production is something that I wouldn't advise to the U.S. government or another government. But they have to produce oil and gas in a sustainable manner, and of course technologies and projects are already there to make sustainable oil and gas production.\"", "description": "Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA, told CNBC that a ban on fracking would have \"major implications\" for the U.S. energy industry.", "authors": ["Natasha Turak"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105789134-1552409051692p3110130.jpg?v=1552491427", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
