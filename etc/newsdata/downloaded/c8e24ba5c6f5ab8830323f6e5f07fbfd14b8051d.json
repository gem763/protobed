That year he visited New York City for the first time. He stayed for a few weeks, touring the city and crashing with friends in Queens and Flatbush.\n\nAD\n\nWhat difference could one misplaced Minnesotan make in a city of 8 million? Well, that fall, the Amazin\u2019 Mets won the World Series. In January, the Jets had stunned everyone by winning the Super Bowl.\n\nAD\n\nCould it be that, just as homeopaths believe an infinitesimal dose of a medicine diluted in water can create a miracle cure, a little bit of Dave goes a long way?\n\n\u201cTen years later, in 1979, I moved back to Pittsburgh to go to grad school,\u201d Dave said. \u201cIn January 1979, the Steelers beat the Cowboys in the Super Bowl.\u201d That same year the Pirates won the World Series.\n\nFast forward a decade. In 1989, Dave moved to Kalamazoo, Mich. That year the Detroit Pistons won the NBA championship, and the Michigan Wolverines were NCAA national champs in basketball.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think it really struck me after being in Michigan and looking back over the years that ended in 9,\u201d he said. He was a human rabbit\u2019s foot.\n\nDave\u2019s work then took him to Des Moines.\n\n\u201cThere weren\u2019t any major league teams in Iowa in 1999, but the Des Moines Dragons in the International Basketball League won the championship, and the Iowa Barnstormers were division champs in Arena Football,\u201d he said. (Hard core AFL fans will recall Iowa lost in the playoffs to eventual champs the Orlando Predators.)\n\nAD\n\nDave moved to the Washington area in 2001. (He lives in Silver Spring.) Now here we are in 2019, another year ending in 9. The Mystics just won the WNBA championship, and the Nationals are leading the Cardinals in the NLCS.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou heard it here first: I predict the Nationals will win it all, and I have the record to prove it,\u201d Dave said.\n\nBut, Dave, you were also living here in 2009, when the Nats went 59-103 and the Redskins went 4-12. What went wrong?\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to figure that out,\u201d he said. \u201cI definitely missed that decade. I wasn\u2019t much help.\u201d\n\nPerhaps that was the exception that proves the rule. In any event, Dave is pretty sure how things are going to turn out this year for the Nats.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve thought of franchising myself, selling myself to some city that needs some championships,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nThe ultimate sacrifice\n\nWhat true fan of Washington football would not have been cheered by the banner towed behind an airplane above Miami\u2019s Hard Rock Stadium during Sunday\u2019s Skins-Dolphins game? It read: \u201cHelp Skins Fans Fire Bruce Allen!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOf course, even if Allen, the team president, is fired, who\u2019s going to fire owner Dan Snyder? The only hope I see for the hapless team is if Snyder fires himself. Could it happen?\n\nWhen Snyder bought the team in 1999, newspaper profiles focused on how he\u2019d grown up adoring the burgundy and gold, how he went to his first Skins game at age 7, how his mother would make \u201cRedskins chili\u201d to serve to Dan and his friends when they watched games on TV, how he proudly wore his Skins belt-buckle to school. He was, it seems, someone who loved the Redskins.\n\nAlas, we sometimes hurt the people we love the most. We desire someone so much that our love becomes obsessive, destructive. We micromanage their lives. We get suspicious. We lash out. We sign Albert Haynesworth.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEven Snyder must realize there\u2019s only one common denominator in the team\u2019s abysmal performances since 1999: him. If Snyder really loved the team \u2014 loved the team rather than loved owning the team \u2014 he would sell it.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened to another beloved (and occasionally maligned) Washington institution. The Meyer-Graham family had been connected to The Washington Post since 1933, when Eugene Meyer bought the paper at a bankruptcy sale. For decades, it was a journalistic and financial success. Then came the Internet. Journalists were laid off. Bureaus were closed.\n\nIn 2013, Meyer\u2019s grandson Don Graham and great-granddaughter Katharine Weymouth sold their beloved Post to billionaire Jeff Bezos. It was the only way for it to survive. To put it another way: For Don so loved The Post that he sold it, that whosoever readeth the paper should have everlasting news.\n\nFor Dan Snyder, the question boils down to: Would you rather own a losing team or root for a winning one?\n\nFor previous columns, visit washingtonpost.com/john-kelly.\n\nAD", "description": "Wherever Dave Feehan moves, championships follow.
