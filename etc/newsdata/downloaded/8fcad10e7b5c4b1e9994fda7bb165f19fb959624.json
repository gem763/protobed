Has some fantastic action and loved how the film features 3 female protagonists that all kick-ass. So awesome seeing Linda Hamilton back as Sarah Connor.\"\n\nMeanwhile, writer Christopher Schmitt said : \"Saw a surprise advanced screening of @Terminator : Dark Fate. If you\u2019re a fan, go see it \u2014 it\u2019s the #Terminator sequel we\u2019ve been waiting for.\"\n\nGermain Lussier of Gizmodo and io9 wrote : \"Terminator: Dark Fate is basically Terminator: The Force Awakens. A satisfying, exciting reboot that\u2019s essentially the best parts of T1 & T2 in a blender. Davis, Reyes & Hamilton are excellent, the action wows & while it\u2019s familiar, it\u2019s easily the best T3 yet. Terminator is back\"\n\n(Image: Twentieth Century Fox)\n\nMatt Singer of Screencrus.com said : \"TERMINATOR\u2019s thought of as Arnold\u2019s franchise. DARK FATE makes it clear he wasn\u2019t the key ingredient that made it work. It was Linda Hamilton. She\u2019s incredible in this, and the movie\u2019s very solid. (I recently defended all the TERMINATOR sequels, so make of this what you will.)\"\n\nFinally, Mike Ryan of Uproxx noted : \"I was skeptical of TERMINATOR: DARK FATE. Thought the trailers were not great. But I would up enjoying it quite a bit, and the difference maker (vs the other post T2 sequels) is Linda Hamilton. It\u2019s always been HER story and Hamilton adds the needed weight here.\"\n\nWell, maybe we should get our hopes up after all!\n\nTerminator Dark Fate is released in UK cinemas on October 23, 2019.\n\nAre you excited for Terminator Dark Fate?
