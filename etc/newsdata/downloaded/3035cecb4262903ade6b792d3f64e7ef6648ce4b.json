But the higher tax rate will still hit an economy suffering from slowing global demand and bitter trade tensions.\n\nThe government and central bank policymakers expect the impact from the 2%-point tax hike to be much smaller than that of the previous increase.\n\nTo ease the pain on low-income households, some food and non-alcoholic beverages will be exempt from the higher tax rate.\n\nThe government has also set aside 2 trillion yen for discounts and shopping vouchers as well as public works spending. Another 300 billion yen will be spent on tax breaks for housing and car purchases.\n\nBut that may not be enough to boost consumption.\n\n\"The reduced tax rate and reward points system may limit the pain to shoppers,\" said Koya Miyamae, a senior economist at SMBC Nikko Securities. \"Still, consumer sentiment tends to deteriorate before and after a tax hike, which will in turn dampen economic activity.\"\n\nIf the pain proves bigger than expected, the government has said it is ready to deploy additional measures.\n\n\"I'll take the initiative to check the economic situation closely and take additional economic measures flexibly, if necessary,\" Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said on Monday.", "description": "Japan proceeds with twice-delayed sales tax hike as growth sputters", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF901SG_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
