Each of these cases has also prompted inspiring community activism.\n\nThe concept of \u201cenvironmental justice\u201d has only recently entered the mainstream, so our new environmental justice reporter, Nina Lakhani, asked five luminaries of the movement to explain it in their own words.\n\nThey reveal why, alongside global heating and the extinction crisis, it is one of the most pressing issues of our time.\n\nDr Robert Bullard: the \u2018father of environmental justice\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dr Robert Bullard. The \u2018father of environmental justice\u2019 is currently distinguished professor of urban planning and environmental policy at Texas Southern University.

This study found that between the 1930s and 1978, 82% of all the waste in Houston was dumped in black neighborhoods, even though only 25% of the population was black. This was not random or isolated; it was targeted and widespread across the southern states and the nation. We lost in court but the concept of environmental racism was born.\n\nThe seminal Environmental Justice principles adopted by the National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit in 1991 built on this [legal case] and became the foundation for social justice movements across the world. Even so, the same discrimination and racism continues to dictate who gets dumped on and who gets resources to mitigate floods, wildfires and other disasters. Of course those with wealth and political clout do best; if you have money you can buy bottled water or move house. The poor cannot go anywhere.\n\nKandi Mossett-White: the indigenous champion\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kandi Mossett-White, from the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation in North Dakota, is the native energy & climate campaign coordinator at Indigenous Environmental Network. Illustration: Daniela Gilbon/The Guardian\n\nQ: How are native communities impacted by environmental discrimination?\n\nWe cannot talk about environmental injustice without understanding the historical context of colonization and capitalism. The federal government put us on reservations on land they believed to be worthless, but many turned out to be rich in \u201cresources\u201d. This means we\u2019re in the way of profits. In most cases we don\u2019t want these megaprojects coming in and destroying our land and water, but it happens anyway. The situation is even worse for our brothers and sisters in the global south where people are silenced, disappeared and killed to make money with no hope of justice.\n\nI grew up in a community full of environmental injustices without knowing it. So many people I knew \u2013 young and old, men and women \u2013 got cancer, including me during my second year in college. I thought this was normal. Our territory is contaminated by the coal industry, uranium mining, over fertilization and oil. But environmental injustice is a tangled web, it\u2019s about so much more than pollution. Whenever there\u2019s a new megaproject, the area is overwhelmed by men, there\u2019s an influx of money, and a rise in organized crime. After the oil boom in 2007, the number of missing and murdered indigenous women increased, and so did drugs. Gangs came and recruited our young people to sell drugs and many of these young men are now in jail or dead.\n\nMustafa Ali: resigned from the US government under Trump\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mustafa Ali. Policy expert and community organizer, and former head of the EPA environmental justice program who resigned in 2017 after working in over 600 communities over 24 years as the Trump administration prepared to gut the agency. Illustration: Daniela Gilbon/The Guardian\n\nQ: What role does the state play in creating environmental inequalities?\n\nEnvironmental injustice is about [the state] creating sacrifice zones where we place everything which no-one else wants. The justification is always an economic one, that it makes sense to build chemical plants on so-called cheap lands where poor people and people of color live, but which are only cheap because all the wealth and economic opportunities have been stripped out. The people who live in these areas are unseen, unheard and undervalued.\n\nEnvironmental justice is about communities being able to reclaim their power, like Spartanburg in South Carolina, which received a $20,000 EPA environmental justice grant [to help clean up contaminated industrial sites], which it leveraged to almost $300m [from public and private sources, to build housing, a job training facility and health centers on the rehabilitated lands].\n\nIt took a long long time to build trust with communities, create statutes, and programs, which are now being dismantled. The cuts to the EPA proposed by the Trump administration are about protecting the industries which supported Trump\u2019s campaign, and power and discrimination. It\u2019s about showing communities of color and poor communities the administration can do whatever it wants to them because their lives don\u2019t matter.\n\nJamie Margolin: mobilizing the world\u2019s young people\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jamie Margolin. Climate justice youth activist and organizer, and founder of #ThisIsZeroHour. Illustration: Daniela Gilbon/The Guardian\n\nQ: The fight for \u2018climate justice\u2019 has become central to the environmental justice movement. Why are you and so many young people getting involved?\n\nClimate justice has mobilized young people because there\u2019s something in it for everyone. Whether you care about animals, science, pollution, racism, or sexism, all these issues are intertwined with the climate crisis in the worst possible way. Poor people and people of color are much more likely to die in climate disasters than rich people. This means addressing racism, colonialism and patriarchy, because inequalities do not exist in a vacuum, and neither does the climate crisis. It\u2019s the result of all the other societal evils.\n\nFor me, the climate crisis has been looming over my entire life \u2013 and future. Three things happened in 2017 which motivated me to act: the US leaving the Paris agreement, Hurricane Maria destroying Puerto Rico and the wildfires in Canada, which created a thick layer of smog over Seattle that felt apocalyptic. At the beginning my dream with the #ThisIsZeroHour campaign was to mobilize a lot of people for a youth climate march, but it\u2019s got bigger and bigger and we now have a hundred chapters. So far it has been very US focussed but that\u2019s changing.\n\nLeeAnne Walters: Flint\u2019s prize-winning activist\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest LeeAnne Walters. Flint resident, community activist and winner of the 2018 Goldman environmental prize who helped expose the scandal by convincing the city to test the lead-contaminated water. Illustration: Daniela Gilbon/The Guardian\n\nQ: What did we learn from the Flint scandal, in which 100,000 residents were exposed to excessive lead from their tap water?\n\nThe Flint scandal showed the American people and the world that access to clean water in the US is not always a given. It showed that we have testing methods that are flawed, and we need them fixed, and that sometimes the people who are paid to protect us don\u2019t always do what is in our best interests. It has become my personal mission to make sure we get the Lead and Copper Rule [a federal regulation which limits the concentration of these heavy metals in public drinking water] changed so it protects people like it\u2019s supposed to. I want everyone to know that as of today the EPA has not kept its promises to fix the laws, and still allows states to cheat on water testing.\n\nQ: How can people get involved in the struggle for environmental justice?\n\nI was an ordinary citizen compelled to take action after watching my children break out in rashes, scream in agony from taking a bath, unexplained illnesses, losing their hair, and being told the problem was specific to my house even though the same things were happening to children all over Flint.\n\nI made the decision to teach myself about how water is treated, about federal laws, and about how to properly test water, because listening to governmental officials lie to my face disgusted me. When situations like this happen, everyday people need to protect themselves. They need to follow their gut if they feel something is wrong. They need to unite because together we are stronger.\n\nSit down in your groups and communities and figure out people\u2019s strengths. You will have defeats \u2013 use those as learning experiences. You will have victories, rejoice when those happen. Our environment plays a huge role in our health and future generations\u2019 health, so it is our duty as ordinary people to protect it and fight back. We can make a difference.\n\nTo contact Nina Lakhani, the Guardian\u2019s new environmental justice reporter, e-mail nina.lakhani@theguardian.com.", "description": "Five luminaries explain the concept of \u2018environmental justice\u2019 and reveal why, alongside the climate crisis, it is one of the most pressing issues of our time", "authors": ["Nina Lakhani"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66ee48a6f5ba522d817999d6b8b0ebb5b29831e1/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e81a364b78ee94f86efb25e732cc200d", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
