The ban also applies to companies that hold immigrant detainees for the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.\n\nA Geo Group spokesperson said that the company, which operates four private prisons and two immigration detention centers in California, has been in talks with Ice and the US Marshals Service, and that they believe the new law will be struck down by the courts.\n\n\u201cIn particular, we believe the restrictions to force a phase-out of federal detention facilities under private management run afoul of the US Constitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause,\u201d the company\u2019s spokesperson said. \u201cStates cannot lawfully pass legislation mandating the closure of federal facilities that displease them on the basis of ideological differences.\u201d\n\nCalifornia lawmakers disagree and say the ban is part of a broader criminal justice reform push that will protect prisoners serving criminal sentences and immigrants in civil detention from dangerous conditions inside privately run jails.\n\n\u201cWe are sending a powerful message that we vehemently oppose the practice of profiteering off the backs of Californians in custody, that we will stand up for the health, safety and welfare of our people, and that we are committed to humane treatment for all,\u201d said the assemblymember Rob Bonta, who authored the measure, AB 32.\n\nCalifornia bans private prisons \u2013 including Ice detention centers Read more\n\nGrisel Ruiz, the supervising attorney for the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, predicted the law would withstand any legal challenge by the Trump administration or private prison companies.\n\n\u201cThis is a step in the right direction,\u201d said Ruiz. \u201cIt\u2019s bold and big and totally within California\u2019s police powers to do this.\u201d\n\nSeveral constitutional legal scholars chimed in during hearings for the bill this past summer about whether the ban could be applied to private prisons housing federal prisoners and immigration detainees. The UC Berkeley law dean, Erwin Chemerinsky, wrote in an analysis of the bill that states had broad powers to protect citizens and non-citizens within their borders.\n\n\u201cI do not believe that this is pre-empted by federal law or violates any intergovernmental immunity doctrine,\u201d wrote Chemerinsky. \u201cQuite importantly, California is not regulating the federal government; it is regulating private companies, which is very much within the state\u2019s constitutional authority.\u201d\n\nAn Ice spokesperson, Paige Hughes, said Department of Homeland Security attorneys still needed to review the law. But Hughes added: \u201cThe idea that a state law can bind the hands of a federal law enforcement agency managing a national network of detention facilities is wrong.\u201d\n\nHughes said the law could result in Ice transferring detainees out of the state and far away from families and attorneys.\n\nRuiz said that Ice should release immigrant detainees rather than transferring them out of state. \u201cIf fed chooses to transfer people, then advocates will view that as a retaliatory act against California and we will fight tooth and nail to defend those people.\u201d", "description": "Lawmakers seek to protect prisoners and detained immigrants but private prison company expects courts to strike down measure", "authors": ["Darwin Bondgraham"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60bc4d1870bf6ea1425c63fba014e1c979f424d4/0_168_2520_1512/master/2520.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=94161dcbc670576fb073bb8a872a5220", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
