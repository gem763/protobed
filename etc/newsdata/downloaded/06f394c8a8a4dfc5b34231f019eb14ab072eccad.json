The official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity, said previous efforts to broker deals with the Kurds had failed because negotiating \u201cwill not change their basic motivation and will not change their tactics.\u201d\n\nThe official reiterated that Turkey would halt the operation and withdraw its forces only after the border area is cleared of \u201cterrorists\u201d but would not stay in Syria \u201cone more day than is necessary.\u201d\n\nThe Pentagon had said before the operation began that the U.S. military would not support it, but it had not openly criticized the invasion. The U.S. pulled about 30 special operations troops out of observation posts along the invasion route on the Syrian border.\n\nIn a written statement, the chief Pentagon spokesman, Jonathan Hoffman, said that in a phone call Thursday with his Turkish counterpart, Defense Secretary Mark Esper \u201cmade it clear\u201d that the U.S. opposes the incursion.\n\nHoffman said Esper told Defense Minister Hulusi Akar that his government\u2019s military actions \u201cplace at risk\u201d the progress made to defeat the extremists, and Esper urged Turkey to stop its incursion. Turkey views elements of the U.S.-backed Syrian militia as terrorists and a border threat.\n\n\u201cWhile the secretary reaffirmed we value our strategic bilateral relationship, this incursion risks serious consequences for Turkey,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cThe secretary also reiterated his strong concern that, despite U.S. force protection measures, Turkey\u2019s actions could harm U.S. personnel in Syria.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. has about 1,000 troops in Syria.\n\nInternational aid agencies have warned of a humanitarian crisis, with nearly a half-million people at risk near the border.\n\nEsper \u201cstrongly encouraged Turkey to discontinue actions in northeastern Syria in order to increase the possibility that the United States, Turkey and our partners could find a common way to deescalate the situation before it becomes irreparable,\u201d Hoffman said.\n\nGen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, spoke by phone Wednesday with his Turkish counterpart to discuss the security situation in Syria. Details were not released.\n\nEsper and Milley planned to hold a noon news conference to discuss Syria.\n\nThe Turkish incursion has complicated U.S. military efforts in the region, even as Washington seeks to deter Iran from further attacks on Saudi Arabia following a drone and cruise missile assault in September that damaged key Saudi oil facilities. In response, the U.S. said it as deploying additional air defenses to Saudi Arabia.", "description": "The Pentagon criticized the latest move by Turkey to launch an offensive against Syrian Kurds who partnered with the U.S. to fight ISIS.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da0af3e200000690550006a.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
