Kamala Harris received when she went after Biden on the issue of race in the first debate in June. Castro was fundraising off of his attacks on Biden not long after the debate ended.\n\n\"I had a critical choice to make on the debate stage last night,\" Castro said in an email to supporters. \"I could either play it safe and give Vice President Biden a free pass like everyone else. Or I could speak up, challenge the conversation, and demand answers for you and your family.\"\n\nCastro has denied that he was attempting to raise questions about Biden's mental fitness by challenging the former vice president on if he could remember what he said \"two minutes ago,\" but that's how it's been widely interpreted.\n\nMSNBC's Chris Matthews described Castro's remarks as a \"cheap shot\" as CNN's Chris Cuomo suggested he went \"too low\" in that moment and asked if he regretted it.\n\nThere's an ongoing debate as to whether Castro was correct (PolitiFact rated his statement \"Mostly False\").\n\nThe transcript shows Biden at one point stating that his plan includes an option in which \"you automatically can buy into this.\" This is what Castro was seizing on in the heated exchange, which he made clear in a subsequent tweet. Both campaigns have since claimed they were in the right.\n\nAfter the debate, some of the other Democratic candidates criticized Castro's tactics. \"I will disagree with Joe on our record and our vision for the future. I am not going to go after him personally, that's not right,\" Sen. Bernie Sanders told CNN.\n\nBut others, like Sen. Cory Booker, defended Castro.\n\n\"Look, I think that we are at a tough point right now, because there's a lot of people who are concerned about Joe Biden's ability to carry the ball all the way across the end line without fumbling,\" Booker said.\n\n\"I think that Castro has some really legitimate concerns about, can he be someone in a long grueling campaign that can get the ball over the line? And he has every right to call that out,\" he added.\n\nMichael Gordon, a Democratic strategist and principal at a strategic communications firm Group Gordon, told Insider in a Friday phone interview he believed Castro's attack ultimately backfired.\n\nGordon said the attack \"absolutely hurt Castro significantly more than it hurt Biden because of the nature of the attacks. They were more personal than policy-based and he just came across as angry rather than thoughtful...he needs to do something more original than simply attacking the front runner.\"\n\nGordon also suggested that while Castro's attacks backfired on him in the short term, they may have actually helped Biden's main rivals \u2014 Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who had the benefit of Castro going after Biden on their behalf without being subject to the same amount of backlash.\n\n'He did the Democratic party a service'\n\nStephen Nu\u00f1o-P\u00e9rez, an associate professor and chair in the department of politics and international affairs at Northern Arizona University, also questioned whether it was politically prudent for Castro to go this route.\n\n\"I don't know if it was wise for him to do it,\" he told Insider on Friday, and it might hurt Castro down the line if he's vying to be on the ticket as a vice presidential candidate.\n\nA FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos poll of Democratic primary voters confirmed Gordon and Nu\u00f1o-P\u00e9rez's predictions, finding that Castro's net favorability decreased by 6.8% after the debate \u2014 the biggest drop of any candidate.\n\nBut despite the controversy and potential political consequences, Nu\u00f1o-P\u00e9rez also said Castro did Democrats a huge favor.\n\n\"[Castro] did the Democratic party a service, because now the Democrats are talking about how Biden is continuously messing up. He's 76-years-old and this an issue the Democrats need to be honest about going into the election,\" he said.\n\nRead more: Joe Biden responded to a debate question about slavery and reparations by going off on a tangent about how black parents should raise their kids, and people aren't happy about it\n\nNu\u00f1o-Perez said that the Democrats are offering contradictory messages by saying 2020 is the \"most important election in our lifetime\" while simultaneously protecting someone (Biden) who they know is a \"continual-gaffe machine,\" adding that Castro \"pointed that out last night in a very direct way.\"\n\nEchoing these sentiments, Preston Mitchum, an activist and adjunct law professor at Georgetown Law Center, told Insider, \"People should have the right to actually talk about their concerns about Biden and his fitness to run for office without having complaints lodged against them that they're being ageist.\"\n\nMitchum, who identified as a Democrat, said the Democratic party is going to have a rough time in this election if the ageism defense is \"all we have.\" The party has to take a hard look at what it wants, he said, and question whether someone like Biden is really the person who can go \"toe-to-toe\" with Trump.\n\nBusiness Insider is interested in hearing from voters who are following the 2020 Republican primary about questions they have for candidates.
