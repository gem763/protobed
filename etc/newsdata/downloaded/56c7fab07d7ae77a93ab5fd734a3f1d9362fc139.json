The Games, which are celebrating their 53rd year welcomed 84 cities to the event on July 10. Considering that the ICG\u2019s first edition had just nine participant cities, the figures for this year were monumental.\n\nThe Games, which are now under the aegis of the International Olympic Committee were born from one man's desire to \u201ccreate a better world based on friendship.\u201d Today, the ICG is an internationally recognised sports competition for children between 12 and 15-years-old.\n\n\u201cMy childhood suffered from the second World War. It destroyed my family (...) sport seemed to be one of the best means to bring together young people from different countries\u201d, explained once Metod Klemenc, dubbed the \u201cspiritual father\u201d of ICG.\n\nThe opening ceremony was dedicated to the history of the Games, sparking memories of its early origins in Celje, Slovenia in June 1968.\n\nThis year's participants played in Ufa's main stadium. \u201cWe have created modern sports and recreational infrastructure. There are stadiums, training and recreation complexes with state-of-the-art equipment\u201d, said Radiy Khabirov, Acting Head of the Republic of Bashkortostan. In total, more than 400 volunteers brought the competition to life across 16 city venues and 5 sports facilities. The event was sponsored by Gazprom PJSC.\n\nThe Young Ambassadors\u2019 team of the Gazprom International Children\u2019s Social Programme Football for Friendship (F4F) also took part in the event. \u201cI believe that sport is a truly unique tool, helping people of different gender, nationality and age to find not only a common language but also to follow the right path in life by promotion of a healthy lifestyle, teamwork, as well as passion for personal development and reaching the top goals,\u201d said Ananya Kamboj, the Young Ambassador of Football for Friendship from India.\n\nOn July 13, for the first time in the history of the ICG, its participants played a match in accordance with the principle of Football for Friendship: they got the chance to play side by side with their former rivals in mixed teams. The young ambassadors from Football for Friendship had an active role as coaches and young referees.\n\nF4F ambassadors also awarded the participants with special trophies that bestowing commitment to the programme\u2019s nine core values: friendship, equality, fairness, health, peace, devotion, victory, traditions, and honour.\n\n\u201cDignity, strength of character, kindness must be the basis of the personality of every human, and it would be great if they were accepted as norms of conduct,\u201d said Jennifer Chavez Suarez, a Young Ambassador from Bolivia.", "description": "The Opening Ceremony of the International Children\u2019s Summer Games (ICG) saw 192 athletes take part in Ufa, the capital city of the Republic of Bashkortostan.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/02/96/04/1000x563_cmsv2_f25fecce-a648-5314-a6f5-de145c5ba8e4-4029604.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-17"}
