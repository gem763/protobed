If adopted these number plates could then be used to provide owners with benefits like free or cheap parking and the ability to use bus lanes as vehicles with \u201czero emissions\u201d would be easier to single out.\n\nUK Government Department of Transport\n\nThe announcement forms part of the UK government\u2019s \u00a31.5 scheme which looks to make the country the best place in the world to own an electric vehicle. In a press release, the DofT says since the publication of this plan, it has seen record registration of \u201czero emission vehicles\u201d and has marked its intention to become the first G7 country to legislate for net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\nTransport Secretary, Grant Shapps, called the new number plates \u201ca really positive and exciting way to help everyone recognise the increasing number of electric vehicles on our roads\u201d. According to The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), sales of all-electric vehicles have risen sharply in the UK since last year despite an overall drop in car sales.\n\nA mock up of how the green number plates could look UK Government Department of Transport\n\nRead More | 161 MPH Taycan revealed as Porsche's first electric car\n\nIs a green number plate enough?\n\nSome charities, however, believe that there is a lot more the government could be doing. Friends of the Earth campaigner, Jenny Bates, said \u201cGreen number plates may encourage some people to choose cleaner cars, but if ministers really want to boost the take-up of electric vehicles they should introduce more charging points and better financial incentives.\u201d\n\nThe campaigner also highlighted the importance of encouraging people to use greener transport alternatives like rail season tickets and e-bikes to help reduce the number of cars on the road. \u201cIt\u2019s not just exhaust emissions that are the problem: brake and tyre wear produces the most health-damaging fine particle pollution,\u201d she added, \u201c the only real solution to the impact of road transport is to cut traffic levels\u201d.", "description": "The UK government has announced new green number plates on electric vehicles that could offer drivers extra perks.", "authors": ["Rosie Frost"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/25/26/48/1000x563_cmsv2_daa63357-e2a1-5f64-a822-dadfc7e7df0e-4252648.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
