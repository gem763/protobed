But Alphabet\u2019s investment team is far from the only group investing in the restaurant infrastructure as a service business.\n\nPerhaps the best capitalized company focusing on distributed kitchens is CloudKitchens, one of two subsidiaries owned by the holding company City Storage Solutions.\n\nCloud Kitchens and its sister company Cloud Retail are the two arms of the new venture from Uber co-founder and former chief executive, Travis Kalanick, which was formed with a $150 million investment.\n\nAs we reported at the time, Travis announced that he would be starting a new fund with the riches he made from Uber shares sold in its most recent major secondary round. Kalanick said his 10100, or \u201cten one hundred\u201d, fund would be geared toward \u201clarge-scale job creation,\u201d with investments in real estate, e-commerce, and \u201cemerging innovation in India and China.\u201d\n\nIf anyone is aware of the massive market potential for leveraging on-demand services, it\u2019s Kalanick. Especially since he was one of the architects of the infrastructure that has made it possible.\n\nOther deep pocketed companies have also stepped into the fray. Late last year Acre Venture Partners, the investment arm formed by The Campbell Soup Co., participated in a $13 million investment for Pilotworks, another distributed kitchen operator based in Brooklyn.\n\nMeanwhile, Kitchen United has been busy putting together a deep bench of executive talent culled from some of the largest and most successful American fast food restaurant chains.\n\nFormer Taco Bell Chief Development Officer, Meredith Sandland, joined the company earlier this year as its chief operating officer, while former McDonald\u2019s executive Atul Sood, who oversaw the burger giant\u2019s relationship with online delivery services, has come aboard as Kitchen United\u2019s Chief Business Officer.\n\nThe millions of dollars spicing up this new business model investors are serving up could be considered the second iteration of a food startup wave.\n\nAn earlier generation of prepared food startups crashed and burned while trying to spin up just this type of vision with investments in their own infrastructure. New York celebrity chef David Chang, the owner and creator of the city\u2019s famous Momofuku restaurants (and Milk Bar, and Ma Peche), was an investor in Maple, a new delivery-only food startup that raised $25 million before it was shut down and its technology was absorbed into the European, delivery service, Deliveroo.\n\nAndo, which Chang founded, was another attempt at creating a business with a single storefront for takeout and a massive reliance on delivery services to do the heavy lifting of entering new neighborhoods and markets. That company wound up getting acquired by UberEats after raising $7 million in venture funding.\n\nThose losses are slight compared to the woes of investors in companies like Munchery, ($125.4 million) Sprig, ($56.7 million) and SpoonRocket ($13 million). Sprig and Spoonrocket are now defunct, and Munchery had to pull back from markets in Los Angeles, New York, and Seattle as it fights for survival. The company also reportedly was looking at recapitalizing earlier in the year at a greatly reduced valuation.\n\nWhat gives companies like Kitchen United, Pilotworks and Cloud Kitchens hope is that they\u2019re not required to actually create the next big successful concept in fast food or casual dining. They just have to enable it.\n\nKitchen United just opened a 12,000 square foot facility in Pasadena for just that purpose \u2014 and has plans to open more locations in West Los Angeles; Jersey City, N.J.; Atlanta; Columbus, Ohio; Phoenix; Seattle and Denver. Its competitor, Pilotworks, already has operations in Brooklyn, Chicago, Dallas, and Providence, R.I.\n\nWhile the two companies have similar visions, they\u2019re currently pursuing different initial customers. Pilotworks has pitched itself as a recipe for success for new food entrepreneurs. Kitchen United, by comparison is giving successful local, regional, and national brands a way to expand their footprint without investing in real estate.\n\n\u201cOne of the directions that the company was thinking of going was toward the restaurant industry and the second was in the food service entrepreneurial sector,\u201d said Collins. \u201cWould it be a company that served restaurants with their expansions? Now, we\u2019re in deep discussions with all kinds of restaurants.\u201d\n\nSmaller national fast food chains like Shake Shack, or fast casual chains like Dennys and Shoney\u2019s could be customers, said Collins. So could local companies that are trying to expand their regional footprint. Los Angeles\u2019 famous Canter\u2019s Deli is a Kitchen United customer (and an early adopter of a number of new restaurant innovations) and so is The Lost Cuban Kitchen, an Iowa-based Cuban restaurant that\u2019s expanding to Los Angeles.\n\nKitchen United is looking to create kitchen centers that can house between 10-20 restaurants in converted warehouses, big box retail and light industrial locations.\n\nUsing demographic data and \u201cdemand mapping\u201d for specific cuisines, Kitchen United said that it can provide optimal locations and site the right restaurant to meet consumer demand. The company is also pitching labor management, menu management and delivery tools to help streamline the process of getting a new location up and running.\n\n\u201cIn all of the facilities, all of the restaurants have their own four-walled space,\u201d says Collins. \u201cThere\u2019s shared infrastructure outside of that.\u201d\n\nSome of that infrastructure is taking food deliveries and an ability to serve as a central hub for local supplier, according to Collins. \u201cOne of the things that we\u2019re going to be launching relatively soon here in Pasadena, is actually in-service days where local supplier and purveyors can come in and meet with seven restaurants at once.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also possible that restaurants in the Kitchen United spaces could take advantage of restaurant technologies being developed by one of the startup\u2019s sister companies through Cali Group, a holding company for a number of different e-sports, retail, and food technology startups.\n\nThe Pasadena-based kitchen company was founded by Harry Tsao, an investor in food technology (and a part owner of the Golden State Warriors and the Los Angeles Football Club) through his fund Avista Investments; and John Miller, a serial entrepreneur who founded the Cali Group.\n\nIn fact, Kitchen United operates as a Cali Group portfolio company alongside Miso Robotics, the developer of the burger flipping robot, Flippy; Caliburger, an In-n-Out clone first developed by Miller in Shanghai and brought back to the U.S.; and FunWall, a display technology for online gaming in retail settings.\n\n\u201cKitchen United\u2019s data-driven approach to flexible kitchen spaces unlocks critical value for national, regional, and local restaurant chains looking to expand into new markets,\u201d said Adam Ghobarah, general partner at GV, and a new director on the Kitchen United board. \u201cThe founding team\u2019s experience in scaling \u2014 in addition to diverse exposure to national chains, regional brands, regional franchises, and small upstart eateries \u2014 puts Kitchen United in a strong position to accelerate food innovation.\u201d\n\n\n\nGV\u2019s Ghobarah actually sees the investment of a piece with other bets that Alphabet\u2019s venture capital arm has made around the food industry.\n\nThe firm is a backer of the fully automated hamburger preparation company, Creator, which has raised roughly $28 million to develop its hamburger making robot (if Securities and Exchange Commission filings can be believed). And it has backed the containerized farming startup, Bowery Farming, with a $20 million investment.\n\nGhobarah sees an entirely new food distribution ecosystem built up around facilities where Bowery\u2019s farms are colocated with Kitchen United\u2019s restaurants to reduce logistical hurdles and create new hubs.\n\n\u201cAs urban farming like Bowery scales up\u2026 that becomes more and more realistic,\u201d Ghobarah said. \u201cThe other thing that really stands out when you have flexible locations \u2026 all of the thousands of people who want to own a restaurant now have access. It\u2019s not really all regional chains and national chains\u2026 With a satellite location like this\u2026 [a restaurant]\u2026 can break even at one third of the order volume.\u201d", "description": "If investors at some of the biggest technology companies are right, the next big restaurant chain could have no kitchens of its own.
