Isis was and is a deeply bureaucratic organisation.\n\nSoon, the group will announce a successor, continue to rebuild and attempt to show its strength with more attacks. None of which detracts from what will be a huge blow to the terror group, both symbolically and practically.\n\nBaghdadi was responsible for untold deaths and suffering: under his command, Isis committed genocide against the Yazidi people and took thousands of women as slaves. It murdered hostages and massacred civilians \u2013 most of them Muslims in Iraq and Syria.\n\nBorn in the Iraqi city of Samarra in 1971 and radicalised by the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, Baghdadi claimed to have descended from the prophet Muhammad. His background in religious instruction gave him legitimacy in the eyes of his jihadist followers.\n\nHe would prove to be as effective as he was evil. In a few short years, he took the organisation from an underground insurgency to a proto-state that ruled over millions of people.\n\nIn a statement delivered from the White House on Sunday morning, US president Donald Trump struck a triumphant tone as he described Baghdadi\u2019s death in grisly detail.\n\n\u201cHe died like a dog. He died like a coward. The world is now a much safer place,\u201d he said. \u201cBaghdadi\u2019s demise demonstrates America\u2019s relentless pursuit of terrorist leaders,\u201d he added.\n\nAnd yet, Baghdadi\u2019s death will not be the end of Isis. In fact, his death comes at a time when Trump\u2019s policy in Syria may be assisting its resurgence.\n\nA chaotic partial withdrawal of US troops from the Syrian border earlier this month precipitated a new round of conflict in northeast Syria, just months after the caliphate was defeated there.\n\nTurkish troops launched an attack against Kurdish forces, a key US ally in the fight against Isis, just days after the Trump administration said the US would not stand in its way.\n\nMore than 200,000 people have since been displaced in the fighting. Dozens of civilians have been killed and more than 100 Isis prisoners are thought to have escaped.\n\nThe SDF, which worked alongside the US military to defeat Isis in Syria, has slowed its operations against sleeper cells in order to fight Turkey and its Syrian proxies.\n\nThe US troop presence in Syria, while small in number, had acted as a deterrence for a Turkish attack against the SDF, which Ankara views as a terror group for its ties to Kurdish separatists in Turkey.\n\n\u201cEliminating a terrorist leader of this significance and prominence is a major accomplishment for the intelligence and military personnel who made it possible. And it\u2019s a serious step in degrading Isis\u2019s ability to continue radicalising and recruiting,\u201d said Joshua A Geltzer, a former senior director for counterterrorism on the National Security Council in the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cBut the group is bigger than Baghdadi, and this operation alone doesn\u2019t come close to overcoming the strategic error Trump made in abandoning America\u2019s top ground partners in the fight against Isis \u2013 a fight that\u2019s far from over.\u201d\n\nIn its response to Baghdadi\u2019s death, the SDF reiterated that the Turkish operation that Trump gave a green light to has provided \u201ca fertile ground for the revival of Isis and threatens the region and the entire international community\u201d.\n\nAdding to the confusion over his policy in Syria, Trump repeated his desire on Sunday to use US military personnel to protect oil fields in the east of the country, identifying it as a top priority.\n\nMen who fled the last Isis-held area of Syria line up to be questioned by American and Kurdish intelligence officials (Richard Hall) More", "description": "Long before the Isis caliphate met its downfall, before it lost its first battle, when its brutal fighters ruled over a land that spread across two countries and carried out massacres at will, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi knew he was on borrowed time.Such are the perils of leading an international terror organisation", "authors": ["Richard Hall"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/n98AZTz9J61wXO_K_noKqw--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/73029fbb09a1ee97fbdff4fd384b311c", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
