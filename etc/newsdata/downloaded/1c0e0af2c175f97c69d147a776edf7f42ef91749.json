Trump questioned if the process unfairly favored Amazon, long seen as the front-runner.\n\nA challenge from Amazon\u2019s cloud-computing arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS), involving allegations that the president improperly intervened in the contract process would be unprecedented. Some of the top federal contracting experts in the country told The Hill they can\u2019t think of any similar case in recent history.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had other contracts that have had major issues which were fought out in the public but none of which I\u2019m aware where the president is alleged to have somehow tried to influence the procurement process,\u201d Dave Drabkin, a former top procurement executive at the General Services Administration, told The Hill.\n\nSteven Kelman, former head of the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s Office of Federal Procurement and current professor of public management at Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School of Government, called the president\u2019s involvement in a specific contract \u201cextremely unusual, close to unheard of.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s against the norms and expectations of a system,\u201d Kelman said.\n\nFor months, market analysts and tech experts predicted that Amazon would receive the highly sought-after contract, called the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI), noting Amazon is the No. 1 player in the cloud-computing space with an approximately 48 percent market share. The military has given AWS, which provides cloud-computing for the CIA, its highest data management certification.\n\nMicrosoft, which has a slightly lower data certification, is a close second in the cloud computing wars and has been stepping up its outreach to government agencies.\n\nKelman called Microsoft a \u201cplausible\u201d contender. But Friday\u2019s news of the decision came as a shock to everyone watching the JEDI saga unfold. It appeared to also catch Microsoft by surprise. The company did not offer a statement until the next day.\n\n\u201cWe brought our best efforts to the rigorous JEDI evaluation process and appreciate that DoD has chosen Microsoft,\u201d Toni Townes-Whitley, Microsoft\u2019s president of U.S. regulated industries, said in a statement.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe process has been mired in controversy.\n\nOver the summer, Trump publicly questioned whether the JEDI contract was written with Amazon in mind, touting the argument that had been circulated for months by Amazon\u2019s cloud-computing rival Oracle and a procession of Republican lawmakers.\n\nDuring a news conference, Trump said, \u201cI\u2019m getting tremendous complaints about the contract with the Pentagon and with Amazon. They\u2019re saying it wasn\u2019t competitively bid.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of the greatest companies in the world are complaining about it, having to do with Amazon and the Department of Defense, and I will be asking them to look at it very closely to see what\u2019s going on,\u201d he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. Donald (Don) John TrumpTrump Jr. sending copies of 'Triggered' book to Romney, top Democrats Transgender cyclist responds to Trump Jr. criticizing her women's world championship win Trump says he doesn't want NYT in the White House MORE, has publicly referred to the JEDI contract as the \u201ccorrupt #BezosBailout,\u201d claiming it was written to bolster profits for the Amazon chief.

LangevinAmazon poised to escalate Pentagon 'war cloud' fight House Dems introduce bill to fight social media disinformation Hillicon Valley: Senate passes bill to boost cyber help for agencies, businesses | Watchdog warns Energy Department failing to protect grid | FTC sues Match for allegedly conning users MORE (D-R.I.) said in a statement to The Hill. \u201cIf the President in fact took additional steps to influence the contract award, that would be a deeply disturbing development.\u201d\n\nIf Amazon decides to protest the bid, they\u2019re likely to do so either in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, the court that hears monetary claims against the government, or before the Government Accountability Office, the country\u2019s top auditing body.\n\nFranklin Turner, a top government contracting lawyer and partner with the law firm McCarter & English, said Amazon will face a \u201csteep uphill battle\u201d as it seeks to prove any nefarious conduct by the president.\n\nIt\u2019s technically legal for a president to be involved in a federal contracting process, experts said, but it\u2019s against well-established regulations for a contract award decision to involve any factors other than what is laid out in the original solicitation.\n\nIn order to prove wrongdoing in court under those rules, Amazon would have to prove Trump\u2019s feelings toward Bezos factored into the Pentagon\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cThe red flags here ... are that it\u2019s highly atypical for the president of the United States to express such clear disdain for a competitor in a major acquisition like this,\u201d Turner said.\n\nThe protest process will likely hold up the contract for several more months, if AWS chooses to file a lawsuit or complaint.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have lobbied the Pentagon and White House with a flurry of letters and statements about the JEDI contract over the past several months. While members of the House Armed Services Committee warned against holding up the JEDI contract award process any further, top GOP lawmakers \u2014 most prominently Sen. Marco Rubio Marco Antonio RubioDem lawmaker raises concerns over 'eavesdropping' smart speakers Schumer, Cotton request TikTok security assessment House passes bill taking aim at anonymous shell companies MORE (Fla.) \u2014 called on Esper and Trump to freshly review the investigation over allegations that it unfairly favored Amazon.\n\nIn a July letter, Reps.

We cannot delay this program any further if we want to compete and win against our adversaries.\n\nRepublicans are finding themselves backed into a corner as the swirling allegations around the JEDI contract heat up. Several Republican lawmakers who have previously weighed in on the contract, including Rep. Mac Thornberry William (Mac) McClellan ThornberryWalden retirement adds to GOP election woes Overnight Energy: Automakers group sides with Trump in emissions lawsuit | Latest on California wildfires | Walden won't seek reelection | Park Service scraps plan to charge protesters for security Oregon GOP Rep. Greg Walden won't seek reelection MORE (R-Texas), the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, declined to comment on Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats are likely to pounce on any allegations of misconduct as they accuse the president of abusing the power of his office to spurn a rival.\n\nThe JEDI contract will allow Microsoft to develop cloud-computing infrastructure for the U.S. military for up to 10 years, ending in October 2029, though it begins at only two. And it\u2019s a \u201cparadigm-changer\u201d for the company\u2019s business, said Wedbush Securities equity analyst Dan Ives, as the top tech firms in the world duke it out over the \u201c$1 trillion of cloud spending expected to happen over the next decade.\u201d\n\nWith billions of dollars on the line and intense competition for the array of federal cloud-computing contracts that are certain to follow JEDI, Amazon is likely to fight hard.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re surprised about this conclusion,\u201d an AWS spokesperson said on Friday night. \u201cAWS is the clear leader in cloud computing and a detailed assessment purely on the comparative offerings clearly lead to a different conclusion.\u201d", "description": "The fight over the Pentagon\u2019s $10 billion \u201cwar cloud\u201d contract is entering a new phase after the Department of Defense (DOD) awarded the lucrative contract to Microsoft over rival Amazon in a shocking move.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/web_amazon_istock_final_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
