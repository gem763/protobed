Stand with Hong Kong,\u201d referencing the ongoing protests in the region. On Sunday, he clarified in a series of tweets, \u201cI did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China. I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives.\u201d (New York Times)\n\nTalking point: The Rockets have lost several high-profile partnerships as a result of Morey\u2019s tweet, including with the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA), which said Sunday it was ending its relationship with the team. NBA partner Tencent Holdings, which streams the league\u2019s games in China thanks to a deal worth a reported US$1.5 billion, said Sunday it will no longer carry Rockets games. The league issued a Chinese-language statement in the country saying it was \u201cextremely disappointed in the inappropriate comment.\u201d Its tone differed from its U.S. statement, where spokesperson Mike Bass said though Morey made clear his views didn\u2019t represent those of the team or the league, \u201cthe values of the league support individuals\u2019 educating themselves and sharing their views on matters important to them.\u201d China is among the largest markets for the NBA outside of the U.S. Tencent reported 490 million viewers last year, with 21 million people watching Game 6 of the 2019 finals. In comparison, 18.34 million people watched the game on ABC, according to Nielsen.", "description": "", "authors": ["Hanna Lee"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
