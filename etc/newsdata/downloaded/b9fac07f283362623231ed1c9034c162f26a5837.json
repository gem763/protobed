(U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service / AP/AP)\n\nJohn Podesta, the chair of Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, served as counselor to President Barack Obama and chief of staff to President Bill Clinton.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s rush to allow oil companies to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, one of the last unspoiled wildlands in the world, has, to no one\u2019s surprise, become a complete fiasco.\n\nThe fossil-fuel lobbyists who run President Trump\u2019s Interior Department have bullied government scientists, ignored public opposition and cut every imaginable corner to hold an auction \u2014 this year \u2014 that will threaten the largest concentration of polar bears in the United States, the calving grounds of the Porcupine caribou herd and a place of unparalleled natural beauty.\n\nTo add public insult to the injury of shameless self-dealing, Trump\u2019s point man who was tasked with selling off the refuge to oil companies, Joe Balash, just took a top job at a foreign oil company that \u2014 no kidding \u2014 has reportedly been \u201cweighing\u201d a bid at the auction that Balash himself organized when he was at the Interior Department.\n\nInvestigations and court challenges are sure to come soon. Regardless, the Trump administration\u2019s climate calamity in Alaska must be stopped.\n\nAmid the Interior Department\u2019s saga of scandal, it can be easy to lose sight of what is at stake in the administration\u2019s drive to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The Gwich\u2019in people refer to the refuge\u2019s coastal plain, which stretches from the edge of the Brooks Range north to the Arctic Ocean, as \u201cthe sacred place where life begins.\u201d The Porcupine caribou herd \u2014 nearly 200,000 strong \u2014 migrates to the coastal plain each summer to breed. With Arctic sea ice melting rapidly, the United States\u2019 polar bears have become even more dependent on the refuge for their survival.\n\nThe mind-boggling reality of the Trump administration effort to drill in the region is that this extraordinary place \u2014 and the living things that depend on it \u2014 would be sacrificed for oil that the United States does not need and that, in our current climate crisis, our planet cannot afford to burn.\n\nEven the most optimistic proponents of drilling the refuge admit that no significant amount of oil is expected to reach markets until at least 2030. By that time, the United States will need to be well on its way to transforming our transportation system from one dependent on oil to one powered by clean, renewable electricity.\n\nGiven this reality, auctioning off drilling rights is economically foolish and environmentally catastrophic. It would attempt to lock the United States \u2014 and the world \u2014 into future carbon pollution that would devastate our planet. By one estimate, drilling the refuge would contribute an equivalent annual amount of carbon pollution as adding 13 million cars to the road.\n\nThe impacts of this pollution will be worsened by Trump\u2019s other anti-climate attacks in Alaska, including a push to allow new logging in the world\u2019s largest remaining temperate old-growth forest. Trump\u2019s plan in the Tongass National Forest will weaken one of America\u2019s most powerful and effective carbon sponges and endanger the area\u2019s billion-dollar commercial salmon industry.\n\nDetonating a carbon bomb by drilling the refuge while simultaneously chopping down old-growth forest will aggravate the pressures on an Alaskan environment that is already warming at twice the rate of the rest of the world.\n\nIn the coming days, the House of Representatives will take a first step toward restoring protections for the coastal plain of the refuge. Rep. Jared Huffman\u2019s (D-Calif.)\u2019s Arctic Cultural and Coastal Plain Protection Act, which House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is expected to bring to the floor for a vote on Thursday, would block the administration\u2019s oil folly and reinstate long-standing protections for the refuge.\n\nIn the event that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) stops the House bill, it will fall upon a new presidential administration and a new Congress to rescue the refuge and protect the Tongass to avert climate catastrophe.\n\nTo their credit, several Democratic candidates for president have already made clear that they will fight to protect the refuge and reverse the damage that Trump is doing in Alaska and across our nation\u2019s public lands. This stand is both right and popular. Polling consistently shows that most Americans oppose drilling the refuge and want to see more, not less, of our lands and waters protected.\n\nWhat will future generations make of this moment in time? In just the past two months, we have seen massive flooding in the Midwest and Southeast, a supercharged hurricane raze islands in the Bahamas and massive fires tear through the Amazon. We experienced the hottest month ever recorded on Earth.\n\nHistory will note that Trump didn\u2019t merely fiddle while the planet burned but tried to throw the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and Alaska\u2019s old-growth forests into the flames. We must not let him.\n\nRead more:\n\nDan Sullivan: Developing Alaska\u2019s wildlife refuge is a win-win-win\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: What\u2019s one more bad thing in the GOP tax bill?
