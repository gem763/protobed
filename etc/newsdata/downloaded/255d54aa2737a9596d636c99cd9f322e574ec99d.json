Palmer: \u2018Schiff\u2019s a Liar \u2014 I Hope It Gets Back to Him\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "For the most part, Rep. Adam Schiff\u2019s (D-CA) Republican colleagues have low regard for the House Intelligence Committee chairman, who is leading the push for President Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment.\n\nDuring an appearance on Birmingham, AL radio\u2019s Talk 99.5, Rep. Gary Palmer (R-AL), the chairman of the House Republican Policy Committee, put that on display.\n\nHe was asked about the whereabouts of the so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u201d claiming a quid pro quo between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who was promoted by Schiff.\n\n\u201cI was in a briefing Wednesday with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), and I was with the senator Thursday morning, and I am at the point the story has changed on the whistleblower that I am now referring to that individual, whoever it is, as an unnamed collaborator in effort to overthrow a president,\u201d Palmer said on Monday\u2019s \u201cMatt & Aunie Show.\u201d\n\nThe Alabama Republican went on to call Schiff a liar, which Palmer said was demonstrated by his track record.\n\n\u201cSchiff\u2019s a liar,\u201d he continued. \u201cI hope it gets back to him. It\u2019s the consensus that we have. He\u2019s proven himself over and over again to be unreliable. He makes things up as he goes.\u201d\n\nPalmer noted he was onboard with a measure to censure Schiff and referred to his tenure as a federal prosecutor.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m one of the original signatures to censure,\u201d Palmer added. \u201cWe should have done it a long time ago. This is a pattern. I started looking at some of Schiff\u2019s background, and right after he got elected to Congress, he got elected during George W. Bush\u2019s presidency. You may remember, President Bush fired seven U.S. attorneys, and Schiff immediately initiated an investigation. He said the firing of those seven U.S. Attorneys was political.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve got news for him: It\u2019s always political. Bill Clinton fired all 96 U.S. Attorneys the same day after he got elected,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt is the president\u2019s prerogative to have whomever he wants to serve as a U.S. Attorney. So, Schiff has been into this investigation, try to take people down, try to impeach kind of stuff e er since he has been there. He had a rather undistinguished career as a U.S. Attorney himself.\u201d\n\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor", "description": "For the most part, Rep.
