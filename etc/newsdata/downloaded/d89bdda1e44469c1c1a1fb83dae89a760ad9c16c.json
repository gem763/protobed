But the Taliban and Pakistan confirmed the two sides met.\n\nThis is the first meeting Khalilzad has held with the Taliban since last month when US President Donald Trump declared \"dead\" a deal that seemed done but for the signing, blaming an uptick in violence by the Taliban, that included the death of a US soldier.\n\nStill, Trump said he wants to exit Afghanistan, ending the US's longest war, and withdraw its 14,000 troops.\n\nHe as criticised the Afghan government for not doing more to defend Afghanistan and relying on US and NATO troops to police the country.\n\nWhile details of Khalilzad's meeting with the Taliban have been sketchy, there have been reports that the two sides did discuss prisoner exchanges, with the freedom of two professors - an American and an Australian - of the American University of Afghanistan featuring in the discussions.\n\nAmerican professor Kevin King and Australian Timothy Weeks were kidnapped in Kabul August 7, 2016.\n\nThe Taliban have released videos of the two men and have said their conditions have deteriorated.", "description": "Officials of the Afghan armed group say shadow governors, Sheikh Abdul Rahim and Maulvi Rashid,were among those freed.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/7/1ad40c2262864b1d9ac51e28a0aaa890_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
