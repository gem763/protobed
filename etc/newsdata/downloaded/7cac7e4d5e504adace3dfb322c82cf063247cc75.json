They worry that could send Biden to a crippling loss behind Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg, who have highly organized campaigns in Iowa, said the Democrats, most of whom spoke on condition of anonymity to speak candidly about the campaign\u2026\n\nEven though Biden told reporters in Iowa last week he was \u201cworking like hell\u201d to win, Democrats there say he has a lot of ground to make up.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say if action isn\u2019t taken soon, you\u2019re going to find that a person who was 7 or 14 points behind Biden will be breathing down his neck or actually ahead of him,\u201d said Kurt Meyer, chairman of the Mitchell County Democratic Party. \u201cThere\u2019s still time because the caucuses are not on Oct. 27, but action needs to be taken.\u201d\n\nA defeat in Iowa would not end the Biden campaign. He is heavily favored in South Carolina, the fourth contest of the nominating season, but it would slice into his chief argument \u2014 that he\u2019s best suited to beat President Donald Trump.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
