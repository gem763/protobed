Another 10,080 are severely ill after using e-cigs, most of which contained THC\n\n'We really don't think using those products is safe right now,' said CDC Principal Deputy Director, Dr Ann Schuchat.\n\nShe and FDA officials on the call said they think it's unlikely that the epidemic of lung illnesses and deaths has even reached its peak, nor is it declining.\n\n'And in case it's going up, we want to intensify our warning,' they said.\n\n'This is a very concerning outbreak and very difficult to control.'\n\nAlthough 78 percent of the cases reported were among patients who had used THC - 37 percent said they had only used THC - health officials are not yet ready to rule out nicotine e-cigarettes as a possible cause of severe lung damage.\n\nNearly 60 percent of the 570 patients officials have collected data on said they'd used nicotine e-cigarettes, and 17 percent said they had only used nicotine.\n\n'I wish we had more answers about the specific products causing these illnesses,' said Dr Schuchat.\n\n'We're not optimistic that tomorrow we're going to be able to pull all those [products that are] risky from the market,' added an FDA deputy associate commissioner for regulatory affairs, Judy McMeekin.\n\nAlthough the outbreak of these mysterious illnesses began in the Midwest, the latest deaths have bee concentrated around the South.\n\nOne death has been reported in each Alabama, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, and Virginia.\n\nTwo people have died in each California, Kansas and Oregon.\n\nMost patients - about 70 percent - are male and their ages range from 27 to 71.\n\nCDC Deputy Director Ann Schuchat said last Wednesday before Congress there will 'probably be hundreds' more cases.\n\nWorking with the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), the FDA is trying to trace the vapes that have made people sick to their sources and intend to press criminal charges against their makers - but not against users.\n\n'FDA is not pursuing any actions associated with personal use of any vaping products, our interest is in the suppliers,' said FDA Acting Commissioner Ned Sharpless last week.\n\n'But to be clear, if we determine that someone is manufacturing or distributing illicit, adulterated vaping products that caused illness and death for personal profit, we would consider that to be a criminal act.'\n\nOn the Thursday call, McMeekin said: 'We are focused on identifying the products making ill and following the supply chain to the source, not personal use of vaping products.'\n\n'We do have a lot of concerns about black market sources, but I think it's permature to rule out other products,' added Dr Schuchat.\n\nShe added that most sickened people were purchasing their illicit THC vape products from the street, rather than in brick and mortar stores or from authorized dealers.\n\nLast week, a major bust was made by local law enforcement in Minnesota.\n\nPolice and health officials there seized some 77,000 illegal vape cartridges that contained THC - the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis - a haul worth an estimated $3.8 million.\n\nCommissioner Sharpless said the second prong of the FDA's coming enforcement actions will be to try to stem the so-called 'teen vaping epidemic.'\n\nSome one in four high school students have used e-cigarettes in the past month, according to the CDC's latest figures.\n\nThe most popular flavors among under age users are fruity, mint and menthol ones, and companies like Juul Labs are facing investigations into whether their sweet flavored vapes were intentionally marketed to children and teens.\n\nA huge stash of nearly 77,000 illegal THC vapes in colorful packaging branded 'Dank Vapes' (pictured) was confiscated in Minnesota Monday by law enforcement officials as US health officials warned bootleg e-cigs may be to blame for hundreds of lung illnesses\n\nMichigan and New York have temporarily banned flavored e-cigarettes and Massachusetts has halted the sale of all e-cigarettes for the next four months. Illinois is currently legislating a flavored e-cig ban.\n\nSharpless was careful to clarify that the FDA soon-to-come enforcement actions, which have been backed by President Trump, will not constitute a ban on flavored e-cigarettes.\n\n'Rather, FDA intends to enforce existing law that limits the marketing of such products,' he said.\n\n'This policy would not mean that flavored e-cigarettes could never be marketed.\n\n'If a company can show through an application to FDA that a specific product meets the standard set forth by Congress, then the FDA would authorize that [e-cigarette] product for sale.'\n\nBut until then, the FDA will expect e-cigarette companies to pull their products from shelves.\n\nSharpless said that it is the 'FDA's intention to soon finalize a compliance policy related to flavored [e-cigarettes],' but did specify when 'soon' might be.", "description": "Some 80% of patients are under 35 and 16% are 18 or younger.
