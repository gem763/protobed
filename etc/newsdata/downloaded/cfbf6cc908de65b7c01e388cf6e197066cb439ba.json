(Ramon Espinosa/Associated Press)\n\nMCLEAN\u2019S TOWN, Bahamas \u2014 Jeffrey Roberts lifted a mustard-yellow curtain from the ground to hunt for passports and other documents at the place where his family\u2019s home stood before Hurricane Dorian blasted into Grand Bahama Island.\n\nWhat was underneath was sodden and unrecognizable. He shuffled across a white tile floor, the only clear sign this had once been a house, and found a pair of rusty old pliers, only to toss them in frustration. They clattered across the tiles, breaking the silence that had enveloped the fishing community of McLean\u2019s Town.\n\nRoberts was one of thousands of people beginning to return to salvage what few scraps they can from the devastation of Dorian, even as the dark storm clouds of Tropical Storm Humberto hovered above Saturday to remind that that the storm season has not yet passed.\n\n\u201cWe got to take what God gives us,\u201d Roberts said.\n\nIn this case, at least, that was a break: Humberto narrowly missed the island over the weekend and was projected to curve north and then northeast, staying well off of Florida\u2019s east coast.\n\nBy Sunday morning, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said the storm was located about 135 miles (220 kilometers) north-northwest of Great Abaco Island and was moving at 7 mph (11 kph) north-northwest with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 kph).\n\nThe U.S. National Hurricane Center said it would likely become a hurricane by Sunday night, but would remain far from the Bahamas and the U.S. coast by the time it reaches that strength.\n\nThe storm briefly shuttered a couple of small airports, sent people in damaged homes to seek shelter and threatened to interrupt the distribution of sorely needed supplies, including food and water.\n\nAs the storm passed, however, Roberts and others were already returning to the task at hand: resuming their cleanup and recovery efforts in communities such as McLean\u2019s Town devastated by Hurricane Dorian two weeks ago.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres visited the nearby island of Great Abaco on Saturday to support humanitarian efforts in the wake of the storm, which left thousands in need of food, water and shelter.\n\n\u201cHurricane Dorian has been classified as Category 5. I think it\u2019s Category Hell,\u201d the secretary-general said, adding he was horrified by the \u201clevel of systematic devastation.\u201d\n\nThe islands\u2019 official death toll from the hurricane remained at 50 and the number of missing at an alarming 1,300 people, although officials cautioned the list is preliminary and many people could just be unable to connect with loved ones.\n\nMeanwhile, detritus was piled high in the fishing village at the eastern end of Grand Bahama as neighbors tried to salvage what was left behind.\n\nPatrice Higgs stood barefoot in her backyard with gray mud caked on her feet, staring listlessly at the horizon. She occasionally pointed at some of her belongings that remained tangled in the debris and out of reach, including a cream-colored loveseat.?\n\nShe said she lost five relatives to Dorian.\n\n\u201cMy sister, my niece, my nephew, my aunty and my cousin,\u201d she said, as dark clouds threatening rain hung overhead.\n\nThe couple then took a break and sat outside as they watched a neighbor, Cecil Leathen, pry his boat out of fallen trees with the help of a backhoe operated by another neighbor.\n\nFriends nestled a soggy couch cushion between the backhoe and the boat\u2019s motor to protect it as they successfully pushed it onto a trailer.\n\nThen Leathen raised his right fist into the air in celebration.\n\n\u201cIt takes some time,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll get it back together.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
