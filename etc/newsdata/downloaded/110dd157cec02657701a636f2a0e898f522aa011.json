Fiji crossed again moments later, but scrumhalf Frank Lomani\u2019s try was also scratched by the TMO after a forward pass.\n\nWorse was to come for Wales when hooker Ken Owens was yellow-carded in the eighth minute for flipping number eight Viliame Mata on his back in an ugly tackle.\n\nThe barnstorming Semi Radradra, named player of the match, made Wales pay at once, setting up a try for fullback Kini Murimurivalu in the right corner.\n\nFlyhalf Ben Volavola failed to covert either try, however, and Fiji\u2019s gains were further squandered by lock Tevita Cavubati who was yellow-carded for a shoulder charge in the 17th minute.\n\nBiggar wasted no time setting up Wales\u2019 first try with a sumptuous cross-kick to Adams. Wales\u2019 forwards then ramped up the pressure and Fiji\u2019s scrambling defence was soon on the brink of collapse.\n\nFlanker Semi Kunatani saw yellow for a fourth off-side penalty and soon after Adams was strolling over for his second five-pointer as the Welsh sliced open Fiji\u2019s threadbare right flank.\n\nFiji were fortunate to trail by only four points at 14-10 at the break but blew a chance to retake the lead in the 49th minute with another forward pass disallowing a try for Radradra.\n\nBIGGAR WORRY\n\nThe game turned on its head minutes later, however, as Davies was yellow-carded for a ruck infringement.\n\nFiji kicked for the corner, rumbled a lineout drive to the line and were awarded a penalty try after Wales collapsed the maul.\n\nRugby Union - Rugby World Cup 2019 - Pool D - Wales v Fiji - Oita Stadium, Oita, Japan - October 9, 2019 Fiji players look dejected after the match REUTERS/Edgar Su\n\nA shudder went through the Welsh crowd when Liam Williams clattered into Biggar as both attempted to catch a clearing kick. After several minutes of medical attention, Biggar groggily got to his feet and jogged off the field.\n\nHis replacement Rhys Patchell stepped up to slot a 42-metre penalty and minutes later Adams had his hat-trick, again at the corner following a stunning linebreak by Davies.\n\nFiji provided plenty of highlights but were guilty of a defensive blunder late on as scrumhalf Gareth Davies cantered through a hole to set up Williams for the sealing try.", "description": "Winger Josh Adams grabbed a hat-trick of tries as a battered and bruised Wales battled to a 29-17 bonus-point win over Fiji on Wednesday to book their place in the Rugby World Cup quarter-finals.", "authors": ["Ian Ransom", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438820166&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9810I", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
