In Mexico, the man commanded a squad of approximately 240 men armed with machine guns, grenades, and homemade cannons.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, U.S. District Judge Hilda Tagle sentenced 34-year-old Luis Ivan \u201cEl Machin\u201d Nino Duenes to 20 years in prison on conspiracy charges related to the mass importation of cocaine and marijuana. Nino Duenes previously pleaded guilty to those charges in 2014 in a cold plea with prosecutors, but his sentencing hearing was postponed numerous times.\n\nOn October 26, 2011, Nino Duenes and his boss Jose Luis \u201cWicho\u201d or \u201cXW\u201d Zuniga crossed from Rio Bravo, Tamaulipas, into Texas where authorities arrested them near the river. The bosses were fleeing from a rival faction of the Gulf Cartel after a series of fierce battles. At the time of their arrest, the group had various bricks of cocaine, cash, and a jeweled handgun. Since then, Zuniga has been convicted and sentenced to 50 years in prison.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, prosecutors claimed Nino Duenes \u201cutilized automatic weapons, grenades, homemade cannons, and body armor\u201d to provide security for the Gulf Cartel\u2019s drug trafficking operations. Prosecutors also claimed Nino Duenes was the commander for Wicho\u2019s forces and led a squad of approximately 240 gunmen into violent shootouts.\n\nIldefonso Ortiz is an award-winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.
