(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Redskins and Bears have met 50 times in their franchises\u2019 histories, including seven times in the postseason, but Monday\u2019s matchup at FedEx Field will be their first on \u201cMonday Night Football.\u201d The outcome will mark the end of one of two seven-game streaks.\n\nThe Redskins have lost seven straight \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d games since a Colt McCoy-led upset of the Cowboys in 2014, including blowout defeats at New Orleans and Philadelphia last year, and have been outscored by an average of nearly 14 points in those games. The Redskins have also won seven straight games against the Bears dating back to 2004, their longest active winning streak against any team.\n\nWashington\u2019s struggles on \u201cMonday Night Football,\" especially at home, have been well-documented. The Redskins are 2-16 at FedEx Field on Monday night since the stadium opened in 1997 and 6-23 on Monday night overall during that span. Washington\u2019s 23 losses and .207 winning percentage on \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d since 1997 are both league worsts.\n\nThe Bears are 16-11 on \u201cMonday Night Football\" since 1997, including an impressive 9-6 mark away from Soldier Field. Only five teams that have played at least five road games on \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d since 1997 have a better winning percentage.\n\n[Redskins' defensive struggles turn up the heat on Josh Norman, Jay Gruden]\n\nFor whatever reason, the Redskins have dominated their series with Chicago in recent years, with Kirk Cousins, Robert Griffin III, Donovan McNabb and Mark Brunell among the quarterbacks to earn wins during the streak. Washington\u2019s last loss in the series came on Dec. 21, 2003, when Paul Edinger drilled a 45-yard field goal with five seconds remaining at Soldier Field to drop the Redskins to 5-10.\n\nHere\u2019s a look back at the Redskins\u2019 seven-game winning streak against the Bears. (If you\u2019re in the mood for misery, most of the Sports fronts from the Redskins\u2019 Monday night home losses since 1997 can be found here.)\n\nDec. 24, 2016: Redskins 41, Bears 21\n\nKirk Cousins threw for 270 yards and ran for a pair of touchdowns, and the Redskins intercepted five passes in a blowout win at Soldier Field that kept their playoff hopes alive. Cousins\u2019s wife packed him a snazzy Christmas suit for the occasion.\n\n[Booger McFarland on the Redskins defense, 'iconic' FedEx Field and Bruce Allen]\n\nDec. 13, 2015: Redskins 24, Bears 21\n\nDustin Hopkins\u2019 field goal in the final minute was the difference, giving Washington its first road win of the season. The triumph sparked a four-game winning streak to end the season that helped the Redskins clinch the NFC East title.\n\nOct. 20, 2013: Redskins 45, Bears 41\n\nIn a game that featured eight lead changes, running back Roy Helu\u2019s touchdown in the final minute put the Redskins ahead for good.\n\nOct. 24, 2010: Redskins 17, Bears 14\n\nDeAngelo Hall tied an NFL record with four interceptions, all of them in the game\u2019s final 24 minutes, and returned one for a 92-yard touchdown to overcome McNabb\u2019s 17-for-32, two-interception performance.\n\nDec. 6, 2007: Redskins 24, Bears 16\n\nTodd Collins replaced an injured Jason Campbell in the second quarter and helped Washington snap a four-game losing streak. Collins won his next three starts to lead the Redskins to an improbable playoff berth.\n\nSept. 11, 2005: Redskins 9, Bears 7\n\nJohn Hall kicked three field goals and Cornelius Griffin sacked Bears rookie Kyle Orton to force a fumble that preserved Washington\u2019s win at home.\n\nOct. 17, 2004: Redskins 13, Bears 10\n\nOla Kimrin kicked a pair of field goals to help the Redskins beat Chicago at Soldier Field in a defensive struggle.\n\nRead more on the Redskins:\n\nEreck Flowers knows he has a long way to go, but with Redskins, he\u2019s enjoying football again\n\nToo many near-misses doom the Redskins in a frustrating loss to the Cowboys\n\nCase Keenum is part of the solution, but the Redskins\u2019 problem might be too big\n\nFor the Redskins, 0-3 would mean doom.
