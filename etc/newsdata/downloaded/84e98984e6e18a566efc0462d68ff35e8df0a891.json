In 2016, the then-vice president threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees to Ukraine if the government did not fire the country\u2019s top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin. According to the New York Times, \u201cAmong those who had a stake in the outcome was Hunter Biden \u2026 who at the time was on the board of an energy company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch who had been in the sights of the fired prosecutor general.\u201d The Post reports that it is \u201cunclear how seriously Shokin \u2014 who was under fire by U.S. and European officials for not taking a more aggressive posture toward corruption overall \u2014 was scrutinizing Burisma when he was forced out.\u201d But what is clear is that Biden bragged about getting him fired, declaring last year: \u201cI looked at them and said, \u2018I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money.\u2019 Well, son of a b----. He got fired.\u201d\n\nThis weekend, Biden told reporters, \u201cI have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.\u201d That is flatly untrue. Hunter admitted in an interview with the New Yorker that his father expressed concern about the Burisma post at least once: \u201cDad said, \u2018I hope you know what you are doing,\u2019 and I said, \u2018I do.\u2019\u201d Moreover, the New Yorker reports that, \u201cIn December, 2015, as Joe Biden prepared to return to Ukraine, his aides braced for renewed scrutiny of Hunter\u2019s relationship with Burisma. Amos Hochstein, the Obama Administration\u2019s special envoy for energy policy, raised the matter with Biden.\u201d That same month, the New York Times published an article about how Hunter\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine undermined the vice president\u2019s anti-corruption message, which quoted a Biden spokesman saying it had no impact.\n\nSo, Biden was fully aware of his son\u2019s involvement with Burisma when he pressured Ukraine to fire the prosecutor in 2016. He should have known that his using U.S. aid as leverage to force the prosecutor\u2019s dismissal would create, at a bare minimum, the appearance of a conflict of interest. Federal ethics regulations require \u201call employees to recuse themselves from participating in an official matter if their impartiality would be questioned.\u201d Biden violated these rules. Imagine if Trump pressured Ukraine to fire a prosecutor who was investigating a company that employed Donald Trump Jr. as a board member. No one would be giving Trump a pass.\n\nOn Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced that Congress will initiate a formal impeachment inquiry over the Ukraine episode, a move Joe Biden endorsed in a speech, declaring, \u201cIt\u2019s time for the Congress to fully investigate the conduct of this president.\u201d Such an investigation will be far more damaging for Biden than the president. It will keep the story of Biden\u2019s conflict of interest in the news through the 2020 election. Millions of Americans will learn the word \u201cBurisma.\u201d Senate Republicans can demand that Hunter Biden testify, and subpoena Obama White House aides such as Hochstein to explain under oath what the vice president knew and when he knew it.\n\nPut aside the prosecutor\u2019s firing. Hunter took the position with a Ukrainian natural gas company just a few weeks after his father visited Ukraine in 2014 to urge its government to increase its natural gas production. Hunter Biden had no expertise in Ukraine or natural gas. It will not just be Republicans calling this suspicious; nonpartisan experts in ethics law will testify that this a major conflict of interest.\n\nAnd the focus will not just be on Ukraine but also how, as The Post reported, \u201cfor more than two decades, [Hunter\u2019s] professional work often tracked with his father\u2019s life in politics, from Washington to Ukraine to China.\u201d Trump will use an investigation to paint Joe Biden as a creature of the Washington swamp who used his official position to enrich his son. While Senate Republicans will not remove Trump from office, Democratic primary voters might decide that Biden and his troubles are a distraction they do not need. The irony is the Democrats\u2019 investigation might do more to deny Biden the presidency than Trump.\n\nRead more:\n\nEd Rogers: The whistleblower complaint may end up being worse for Joe Biden than Trump\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: Congress, don\u2019t fall into this trap\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: In Ukraine, Trump\u2019s allies are corrupt oligarchs and Russian stooges\n\nCarl Bildt: Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine are helping the Kremlin and hurting the U.S.\n\nGreg Sargent: Here\u2019s a timeline of Trump\u2019s latest scandal.
