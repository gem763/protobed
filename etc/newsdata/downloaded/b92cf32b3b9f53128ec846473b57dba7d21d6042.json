Getty Images\n\n\u201cAs a club off the pitch we have a set of visions, missions and values and at the top of that sits supporting the team to \u2018win trophies\u2019.\n\n\u201cTwo words, because ultimately that is what our fans want and that is what we need to deliver.\u201d\n\nCity have been the domestic benchmark for their rivals, with four Premier League titles, four League Cups and two FA Cups since 2011. However, Moore insists Liverpool are following their own path.\n\n\u201cWe feel good about the club in its entirety and we don\u2019t compare ourselves with any other football club,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat Liverpool had to do was bring in a world-class manager, which we have, bring in a world-class squad, which we have, play exciting football, bring in players that are going to draw crowds no matter where they go \u2013 we\u2019ve done that \u2013 build financial security at the club, we\u2019ve done that.\n\n\u201cIt all sets us up for success going forward. It is not a question of us comparing ourselves versus another club.\u201d\n\nExactly nine years ago Fenway Sports Group \u2013 then New England Sports Ventures \u2013 completed their \u00a3300m purchase of the club.\n\nTheir first job was paying off the \u00a3237m owed to major creditors Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 ruling out any threat of the club\u2019s holding company being put into administration.\n\nThey inherited a club, unthinkably, in the Premier League\u2019s bottom three with six points from their opening seven matches during the short-lived reign of Roy Hodgson.\n\nSustained investment in the squad and infrastructure has elevated the American group to the highest point of their ownership, with the club posting \u00a3125m record profits \u2013 re-invested back into the squad even before the financial results were announced in February \u2013 winning the Champions League and starting this season brilliantly.\n\nIt has not all been plain sailing with walk-out protests over ticket price rises in 2016 and a recent issue over the failed attempt to trademark the word \u2018Liverpool\u2019 but on-field success has appeased fans.\n\n\u201cFrom a prestige perspective it (the Champions League victory) kind of gets us back to where we once were in what we liked to call \u2018European royalty\u2019, so the impact is massive,\u201d said Moore.\n\n\u201cWhen we look at the health of the club our revenues have doubled in the last five years and been reinvested back into the squad. We have steadied the ship from some dark days nine years ago.\n\n\u201cWe take great pride in our business model: a self-sustaining football club. Simply, you drive revenues as best you can to invest on the pitch and that investment on the pitch pays off and global sponsors and advertisers want to be a part of that.\n\n\u201cThey continue to give the football club revenue which will again drive investment on the pitch and we win more games.\n\n\u201cIt is a virtuous cycle and that is the modern business model for high-performing football clubs: invest, invest, invest for success.\n\n\u201cYes, we had that headline, \u00a3125million, but all of that money, by the time we had announced that, had been reinvested in players like Virgil Van Dijk, Alisson Becker, Naby Keita and Fabinho. But the club is in fine shape financially.\n\n\u201cI think, as you saw from Jurgen\u2019s comments, he has the squad he likes and we have locked this squad up on long-term contracts, which is important.\n\n\u201cHe has built the chemistry and these players are content, motivated and excited to win \u2013 not just for Jurgen and the coaching staff but for the people of Liverpool and broader global fanbase.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Liverpool\u00a0chief executive Peter Moore believes adding a long-awaited league title to their Champions League triumph is the \u201cbarometer of success\u201d by which the club is judged.
