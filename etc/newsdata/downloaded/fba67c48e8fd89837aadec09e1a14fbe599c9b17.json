The problem? They may have accidentally named an attack by Russians after an attack made by Americans.\n\nBe forewarned, I\u2019m gonna be dropping a few minor *spoilers* for the Modern Warfare campaign.\n\nDuring the mission \u201cThe Highway of Death,\u201d major character Farah Karim describes a stretch of road in the fictional Urzikstan in which Russian soldiers bombed forces retreating from the capital city. The Russians, in case you couldn\u2019t surmise, drew the short straw for \u201cCall of Duty baddies\u201d this time around, as did a fictional, Arabic-speaking terrorist group called Al-Qatala.\n\n\u201cHighway of Death\u201d is also the name of a road that leads from Kuwait City to Basra, Iraq. To perhaps oversimplify it, in 1991 American, Canadian, British, and French forces attacked Iraqi soldiers leaving the city \u2014 reportedly the latter were retreating. While there\u2019s no definite number of casualties, estimates range between 200 and 600.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019ve been enjoying Modern Warfare, but this is a bit of a sharp reminder that these war-based games are never without real-world context. I was hoping the game\u2019s writers just came up with a spooky-sounding name for the location and perhaps weren\u2019t aware of the actual location and the things done there, but the similarities are there. Perhaps they thought that enough time had passed that we wouldn\u2019t make the connection.\n\nIf that was the case, well\u2026\n\nSo, uh, it turns out that the new Modern Warfare game just sorta lies about a US war crime and makes it a Russian one because it needs the US forces to be seen as the good guys. So that's\u2026 I don't really have words for how to feel right now.

That starts to reach levels of banana republics where art is created to venerate nationalism as volunteered propaganda. \u2014 SJW \u2013 Spooky Justice Wario (@imranzomg) October 28, 2019\n\nAs with the \u201cWhite Phosphorus\u201d thing that happened before the game\u2019s release, it\u2019s questionable how many players of Call of Duty actually care. And at least with the White Phosphorus, one could make the argument that it\u2019s no more or less heinous than anything else CoD has allowed players to do in the past.\n\nBut in this case co-opting actual military history, intentionally or not, is a little more (to use a loaded term) problematic. As you might expect, Russians aren\u2019t exactly thrilled to be the villains again \u2014 Sony\u2019s already refused to sell the game on the Russian PlayStation Store.\n\nGiven the game\u2019s director told GameSpot (regarding the single-player campaign): \u201cIt\u2019s about civilian collateral damage kind of being, unfortunately, part of the equation.\u201d I can\u2019t say much without spoiling, but the whole moral (if one can call it that) of the story is that no one\u2019s on the side of the angels in war \u2014 I don\u2019t see any reason, assuming the writers were aware of what they were referencing, for them to \u201cRussian-wash\u201d the Highway of Death, given it makes the exact same point very succinctly.\n\nWe\u2019ve reached out to Activision for comment.\n\nRead next: Report: Google is trying to acquire Fitbit", "description": "", "authors": ["Rachel Kaser"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F05%2FModern-Warfare-Reboot.jpg&signature=ce9415337a80f9da2d7e19ec0441656c", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
