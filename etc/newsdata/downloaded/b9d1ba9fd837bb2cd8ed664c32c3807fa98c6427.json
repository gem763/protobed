But if a general election comes first, we will take on the tired old parties with an unambiguous stop Brexit message,\" the party said in a statement.\n\nPolls suggest it's highly unlikely the Lib Dems would win a majority in a forthcoming general election. The party's support is at around 18 percent, behind the Conservatives on 33 percent and Labour on 25 percent. Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson also today ruled out the possibility of joining a coalition with Labour, telling the BBC's Andrew Marr show that Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn \"is not going to be put into No. 10 with Liberal Democrat votes.\"\n\nHowever, the new policy hardens the Lib Dems' position as the most strongly opposed to Brexit among U.K. mainstream parties. That may help attract voters who opted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum.\n\nThough the next U.K. general election is not scheduled until 2022, a snap election is widely expected due to an impasse in parliament over Brexit. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has vowed to take the country out of the EU, deal or no deal, on October 31. His push to call an early election failed twice in parliament last week as his opponents say they want to ensure a no-deal Brexit is off the table before holding a vote.", "description": "Party says it still wants another referendum but will campaign to stop EU exit if election comes first.", "authors": ["Emma Anderson", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1174829702-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
