G\u00e4vleborg county, which includes G\u00e4vle, has among the highest rates of unemployment in the country, at around 9.5 percent, and, like the rest of Sweden, it is struggling to integrate large numbers of immigrants who arrived during Europe\u2019s 2015 migration crisis. The jobless rate nationally rose to 7.1 percent in August, the highest since December 2015.\n\nExporting industries are now also facing the dual threats of a no-deal Brexit and a U.S.-China trade war. Economic growth in Sweden was just 0.1 percent in the second quarter of this year and a survey of manufacturers this month showed activity fell to the lowest level since 2013.\n\nAt the college, L\u00f6fven met a group of students who already have professional qualifications from abroad and who are now learning additional skills needed for the Swedish labor market, including the language.\n\nSeveral took the chance to challenge L\u00f6fven.\n\n\u201cWhy does it take so long for us to have our qualifications validated?\u201d asked a Palestinian dentist.\n\n\u201cThere is no path for us onto the labor market,\u201d said an agronomist from the Middle East.\n\nConfidence sags\n\nWith opinion polls showing voter support for the Social Democrats ebbing, L\u00f6fven can ill afford a prolonged period of economic stagnation, and it is vital for state finances that immigrants quickly transition to the labor market and begin contributing to the tax base.\n\nSupport for L\u00f6fven\u2019s minority government in parliament also remains fragile and could quickly collapse if the economy were to lose further momentum, raising the prospect of an early election. The next scheduled election isn\u2019t until 2022.\n\nThe Social Democrats, the dominant political force for the past century, made their name as the party of workers during Sweden's industrialization, but analysts say it has work to do to staunch a loss of blue-collar votes.\n\n\u201cConfidence in the Social Democrats' unemployment policy has fallen in recent years,\u201d said Tommy M\u00f6ller, a political scientist at Stockholm University. \u201cResearch suggests the party has lost its previously so-clear issue ownership in this area, which has been a key factor behind its long-term success,\u201d he said.\n\nIn G\u00e4vle, L\u00f6fven declined to comment on the 2020 target and referred questions to Employment Minister Eva Nordmark, who was traveling with him.\n\nL\u00f6fven, a former union boss who took over as leader of the center-left party in 2012, has put job creation at the center of much of his strategy.\n\nIn 2013, needing to build momentum to dislodge the two-term, center-right government of Fredrik Reinfeldt, L\u00f6fven announced a surprise target at his party\u2019s congress in Gothenburg.\n\n\u201cWe are going to reach the lowest unemployment rate in the EU, that is a binding target goal on the way to full employment,\u201d L\u00f6fven said. He set a deadline of 2020.\n\nHe edged the election in 2014 and continued to defend his ambitious unemployment target despite growing signs that it was unrealistic.\n\nAnother unconvincing victory at the polls in 2018 has left him reliant on a complex alliance of four other parties to stay in power, and this year, pressure increased on him to drop his jobless target. In September, a ranking of the 28 EU states\u2019 unemployment rates saw Sweden in 22nd place, down from 12th in 2013.\n\nIn its budget for 2020, announced in September, the government allotted SEK 1.3 billion (\u20ac120 million) to labor market initiatives including state-subsidized jobs, but the goal of the EU\u2019s lowest unemployment rate by 2020 was absent.\n\nL\u00f6fven\u2019s political opponents pounced.\n\n\"The target has been abandoned like many of the unemployed,\u201d said Ulf Kristersson, the leader of the largest opposition party, the Moderates, in a speech on September 30.\n\nDirection of travel\n\nIn G\u00e4vle, L\u00f6fven declined to comment on the 2020 target and referred questions to Employment Minister Eva Nordmark, who was traveling with him.\n\nShe said the government\u2019s focus in coming years would be on matching jobseekers to available jobs.\n\nThe government needs to ensure that companies can employ people with the right qualifications and that people are correctly trained for the jobs which are available and which will be available in the future, she said.\n\n\u201cI know there has been a lot of discussion about the 2020 target, but I would say it has been important as a kind of compass which points the direction in which we need to try and travel,\u201d she told POLITICO.\n\nIn the college classroom, an Indian pharmacist, back for a visit with her former classmates, told Nordmark and L\u00f6fven that she felt her journey to the labor market had at times been slowed rather than helped by government processes.\n\nShe said she had only been able to secure a job as a trainee when she had broken away from the programs that were supposed to be supporting her job search.\n\n\u201cI hear what you are saying,\u201d said L\u00f6fven. \u201cI\u2019ll take that with me.\u201d", "description": "The Social Democrat leader struggles to retain his credibility as champion of working people.", "authors": ["Charlie Duxbury", "Laura Greenhalgh", "Laura Kayali"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1137539518-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
