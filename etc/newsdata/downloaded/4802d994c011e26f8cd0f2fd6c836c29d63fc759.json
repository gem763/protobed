Electric vehicle makers will benefit. Tesla\n\nCarbon emissions from fossil fuels hit a record last year, but estimates vary of how much it would cost to meet the Paris target of keeping the global temperature rise to within 2 degrees. The International Renewable Energy Agency says $US750 billion a year is needed in renewables over a decade. United Nations scientists say $US300 billion spent on reclaiming degraded land could offset emissions to buy time to deploy zero-carbon technologies. Here are Morgan Stanley's estimates for the five key technology areas and some of the 33 companies it says are set to benefit.\n\n1.
