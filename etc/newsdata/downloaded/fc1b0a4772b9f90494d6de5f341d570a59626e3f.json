And that was the whole point, according to Stephanie Lundquist, Target's executive vice president of food and beverage.\n\nThinking they were sitting down with third-party researchers for a survey, these customers gave detailed \u2014 and occasionally brutally honest \u2014 feedback about what dismayed and delighted them about the Minnesota-based retailer's grocery options.\n\nLundquist explained how her team tackled overhauling the chain's grocery options during her keynote speech on Sunday at the second annual Groceryshop conference in Las Vegas.\n\n\"They thought we were researchers, so they were really honest about what they liked, and what they didn't,\" Lundquist said.\n\nLundquist herself met shoppers in their own homes to \"listen to them talk about their lives and what they're looking for from retailers.\"\n\nThe result has been a major shift in the company's grocery strategy. These \"immersion trips\" also gave rise to Target's latest brand, Good and Gather, which Lundquist said was slated to become the chain's \"biggest owned brand\" once it's fully rolled out next year.\n\n\"We spent hundreds and hundreds of hours listening to our guests as we started building this brand,\" Lundquist said. \"We shopped our stores with them, we ate with them, and we learned a lot.\"\n\nThe Target executive, who has worked at the chain since 2006, said the company first began to tackle groceries a bit over a decade ago. She said that the operation was \"a huge undertaking, undertaken quickly,\" with Target refitting 1,000 stores to accommodate fresh food between 2008 and 2012.\n\nRead more: 7 mind-blowing facts about Target's business\n\n\"Within a few years, we turned grocery into a $15 billion business,\" she said. \"As a result, we ended up with a food and beverage category that generates sales on par with the categories that had defined Target for decades, like home, apparel, and accessories.\"\n\nBut there was a catch. Target's swift entry into having groceries meant that the chain \"also ended up with a food and beverage department without much of a point of view.\"\n\nLundquist said that the rest of the store offered shoppers a true \"Tarjay\" experience \u2014 referencing the chain's longtime French-sounding nickname among shoppers.\n\n\"But in food, we were simply functional or transactional,\" she said. \"And that's not what a Target experience should ever be.\"\n\nBy interviewing guests, Lundquist said her team discovered specific areas where they \"needed to step up our game,\" namely in digital and supply chain. In some cases, like in her conversation with a Chicago-area shopper named Vanessa, the Target grocery team heard stories that were \"really great to hear.\"\n\n\"I'll never forget this,\" she said. \"We were sitting in her living room, and Vanessa told me the reason she picked this particular apartment is because it's near a Target store.\"\n\nIn other cases, as Lundquist put it, \"the truth hurts.\"\n\n\"We needed to hear all of it because when you add it all up, listening to our guests is what led to our enterprise strategy that we unveiled in 2017, a decision to invest $7 billion to strengthen some of the things our guests say they love about Target, like our owned brands, our stores, and our team,\" she said.\n\nSpecifically, Lundquist said that guest feedback prompted them to double down on brands that guests \"were really responding to,\" like Clif Bar, Oakley, and Annie's. Target has also implemented more \"rigorous testing\" when it comes to its food products.\n\n\"Nothing makes the cut to the shelf unless it's been validated with taste tests and scored as well or better as comparable products,\" she said.\n\nTarget's Good and Gather will cut out artificial flavors, sweeteners, synthetic colors, and high-fructose corn syrup. And Target's grocery team is also focused on ensuring its supply chain is fully compliant in matters of labor, animal welfare, and reliability.\n\n\"We can control the ingredients in our products, the quality, and the taste, and we can control whether our brands deliver on our purpose of helping our guests find joy every day,\" Lundquist said. \"We're doing these things because our guests shouldn't have to make any sacrifice when it comes to getting food at a good value.\"", "description": "Stephanie Lundquist, Target's EVP of food and beverage, said that in its bid to roll out grocery options, the chain created a lineup that was just OK.", "authors": ["\u00c1ine Cain"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7f912e2e22af052164bb48-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
