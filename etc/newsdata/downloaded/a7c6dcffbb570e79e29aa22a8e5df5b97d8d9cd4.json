REUTERS/Lim Huey Teng\n\nSoutheast Asia\u2019s third-largest economy has seen a string of racial flare-ups over the past year and a half, as Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad\u2019s nascent government grapples with an increasingly unhappy majority that fears it is losing its special privileges.\n\nThe union between former ruling party UMNO, which was ousted by Mahathir\u2019s coalition in a general election last year, and Islamist party PAS, promises that political power will return to the ethnic Malay-Muslims should they win in the next polls due in 3 years.\n\n\u201cThe confusion within the government now is because of the absence of brave and worthy Malay leaders,\u201d UMNO President Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said at the signing of the charter, attended by thousands of members from both parties.\n\nPrime Minister Mahathir\u2019s administration has had to delay or withdraw many of its planned reforms after a backlash from the opposition and conservative groups representing ethnic Malays.\n\nMalaysia had to withdraw plans to ratify a U.N. convention against racial discrimination, and to accede to the Rome Statute, which would have seen it joining the International Criminal Court.\n\nMahathir has also had to repeatedly state that the government would not extradite Indian Islamic preacher Zakir Naik, despite an ongoing police investigation for alleged stoking of racial sentiments.\n\n\u201cWe have seen several government policies that have made us Muslims feel threatened... the government now is just pressing down on the Malays and Islam,\u201d university student Mohamad Ilman Hakim said at the charter signing event.\n\nMohamad Ilman, 21, said the UMNO-PAS union is necessary to push for greater Malay-Muslim representation in positions of power, particularly in government and parliament.\n\n\u201cWe see this as a union of the the faithful that will be a platform to help the Malays and Muslims to get their voices out.\u201d", "description": "Malaysia's two oldest political parties signed a charter of formal cooperation on Saturday, presenting arguably the largest political platform for the majority Malay-Muslims at a time of simmering racial and religious tensions.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190914&t=2&i=1429851140&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8D0NL", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
