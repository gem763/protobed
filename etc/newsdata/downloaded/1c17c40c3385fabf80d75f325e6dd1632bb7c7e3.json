The merger will combine New York Media, the publisher of the influential, 51-year-old New York Magazine, as well as five thriving digital brands, with Vox Media, the decade-old company known for building modern media brands and the technology that enables them. Together, as Vox Media, the company will reach hundreds of millions of people and be home to the industry\u2019s leading journalists and creators, building communities and serving audiences across websites, TV and streaming services, podcasts, live-event stages, social platforms, and print magazines. The new Vox Media will also boast multiple, diverse revenue streams including the most scaled premium brand advertising solutions, affiliate commerce shopping, digital and print subscriptions, conferences and events, and a leading TV and audio studio. The deal, which is subject to customary closing conditions, is expected to close later this fall.\n\nVox Media Chairman & CEO Jim Bankoff will remain at the helm of Vox Media, leading all aspects of the expanded company. Pam Wasserstein, currently CEO of New York Media, will take on the new role of President, Vox Media, to oversee strategic initiatives, including commerce and consumer businesses, and the current New York Media brands as a member of Vox Media\u2019s executive team; she will also be named to the Vox Media board of directors.\n\n\u201cI have long admired what Pam and the New York Media team have built, especially their ability to shape conversations with some of the most relevant and ambitious work in digital, print, and events,\u201d says Jim Bankoff, Chairman & CEO of Vox Media. \u201cThis combination puts Vox Media in an unparalleled position to lead the media industry forward by focusing on the highest-quality offerings, most robust business models, and strongest company culture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have drawn inspiration from Vox Media, watching their growth trajectory and success in developing premium editorial brands and leading the industry in areas like podcasting and entertainment. As I began talking with Jim about what the future might look like together, it quickly became apparent that our companies pair incredibly well. We share core values \u2014 above all, a commitment to journalistic excellence \u2014 and each bring complementary areas of expertise to the enterprise. In this partnership, I\u2019m looking forward to creating a new kind of media company with him and our combined teams,\u201d says Pam Wasserstein, CEO of New York Media.\n\nSince New York\u2019s founding in 1968, the magazine\u2019s sophisticated, witty, passionate voice has found a readership far beyond its namesake city. Historically built on advertising, the company has diversified its business in recent years to include affiliate e-commerce with The Strategist (expanding into the U.K. in early October), a digital subscription product, as well as popular consumer events such as Vulture Festival. It also produces several podcasts, and stories from New York have been optioned for movies and TV, from Saturday Night Fever to the recent box-office hit Hustlers. New York Media will join Vox Media with six esteemed editorial properties \u2014 New York, Vulture, The Cut, Intelligencer, The Strategist, and Grub Street \u2014 that have earned 41 National Magazine Awards since 2006; a 2016 George Polk Award for \u201cCosby: The Women,\u201d a powerful precursor to the #MeToo movement; and the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for criticism.\n\nVox Media, prior to this merger, included seven editorial networks \u2014 SB Nation, The Verge, Polygon, Eater, Curbed, Recode, and Vox \u2014 and diverse lines of business including the Concert publisher-led marketplace, the Vox Creative brand studio, the Chorus publishing platform, a conferences-and-events business known for the Code Conferences series, and the Vox Media Studios entertainment division.

Earlier this year, Vox Media acquired Epic, the nonfiction-storytelling powerhouse for Hollywood film studios and Fortune 500 brands, and Coral by Vox Media, a platform dedicated to building safer and more productive engagement for publishers. Over the past few years, Vox Media has been named one of Fast Company\u2019s \u201cMost Innovative Companies in Media,\u201d an Inc. \u201cCompany of the Year,\u201d and one of the Washingtonian\u2019s \u201cGreat Places to Work.\u201d In 2019, the company earned a perfect score on the Corporate Equality Index from the Human Rights Campaign, which ranks the Best Places to Work for LGBTQ equality.\n\nThe editorial networks will remain distinct, with the New York brands led by Editor-in-Chief David Haskell and Vox Media brands led by Melissa Bell, Publisher of Vox Media. As industry-leading journalists and creative minds come together, we expect there to be exciting opportunities for collaboration.\n\nThis merger will bring together a sophisticated suite of products and platforms for modern marketers, across premium products in content, video, audio, events, commerce, print, lead generation, and display. The existing Vox Media properties will immediately benefit from New York Media prowess in commerce and subscription businesses, just as Vox Media will be able to leverage its proven record in TV and podcast development and monetization to the New York Media properties.\n\nVox Media will also accelerate the growth of Chorus, the best-in-class publishing platform for content creation and distribution, which will integrate the best of New York Media\u2019s Clay platform, including commerce and subscription capabilities, into its software. Chorus customers can also benefit from monetization opportunities through the Concert marketplace, which reaches 200 million people each month and 99 percent of the millennial market. Since 2017, Concert has operated across all digital properties at Vox Media and New York Media, enabling marketers to reach premium audiences in an effective, safe, high-quality environment.\n\nThe company will have offices in New York City, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Detroit, and London.\n\nLionTree Advisors is acting as financial adviser to New York Media, and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz is acting as its legal counsel.
