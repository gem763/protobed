He gave his own opinion, OK? I think it was very harmful to make it look like all the Democrats,\u201d Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday. \u201cI can tell you one thing: [Beto] is not taking my guns away from me. You tell Beto that OK?\u201d\n\nDuring last week\u2019s Democratic presidential debate in Houston, O\u2019Rourke spoke of his advocacy for gun control in the wake of mass shootings in Dayton, Ohio, and his hometown of El Paso, Texas. Specifically, O\u2019Rourke was asked whether certain guns already owned by many Americans should be confiscated.\n\n\u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,\u201d O\u2019Rourke responded. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore.\u201d\n\nIn a Wednesday tweet, President Trump said O\u2019Rourke\u2019s words \u201cmade it much harder to make a deal\u201d with Congress on gun control.\n\nWhile Manchin is an avowed gun rights advocate who has boasted of his support from the National Rifle Association, he is far from the only Democrat calling out O\u2019Rourke over his statement.\n\nDummy Beto made it much harder to make a deal. Convinced many that Dems just want to take your guns away. Will continue forward! https://t.co/87jvaYUkyn \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 18, 2019\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know of any other Democrat who agrees with Beto O\u2019Rourke, but it\u2019s no excuse not to go forward,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Wednesday when asked about Trump\u2019s tweet.\n\nO\u2019Rourke challenged Schumer\u2019s characterization of where the party stands on gun buybacks in a Wednesday tweet.\n\nThe majority of the country supports background checks, licensing, red flag laws, and yes, a mandatory assault weapons buyback.\n\n\n\nThe party is with us, the country is with us.\n\n\n\nNow it\u2019s time for Democrats to lead.https://t.co/exwhPYGEtw \u2014 Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) September 18, 2019\n\nSen. Chris Coons, D-Del., said O\u2019Rourke\u2019s remarks were sure to make him the poster child for gun rights activists who fear government overreach in response to mass shootings.\n\n\u201cI frankly think that that clip will be played for years at Second Amendment rallies with organizations that try to scare people by saying Democrats are coming for your guns,\u201d Coons told CNN last week.\n\nIn a Sunday interview with CNN, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg also said he thought O\u2019Rourke\u2019s remark played into Republican hands and that his strategy could backfire.\n\n\u201cWe have agreement among the American people for not just universal background checks, but we have a majority in favor of red flag laws, high-capacity magazines, banning the new sale of assault weapons,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cThis is a golden moment to finally do something.\u201d\n\nButtigieg added that the possibility for compromise could be at hand.\n\n\u201cWhen even this president and even Mitch McConnell are at least pretending to be open to reforms, we know that we have a moment on our hands.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke scoffed at that notion.\n\nWhen candidates say, \"At least Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell are pretending to be interested,\" shit, that is not enough. Neither is poll-testing your message. Gun violence is a life or death issue\u2014and we have to represent the bold ideas of people all over the country. pic.twitter.com/jE2uiXaENZ \u2014 Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) September 15, 2019\n\nFor years, gun rights activists have warned that the Democratic Party is intent on taking away guns. Actor and then-NRA president Charlton Heston made that fear a rallying cry during a speech to the group\u2019s annual convention in 2000, when he warned Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore that any government official seeking to take away his guns would have to do so from his \u201ccold, dead hands.\u201d\n\nAfter O\u2019Rourke floated his idea for the mandatory buyback of certain weapons, Briscoe Cain, a Republican serving in the Texas House of Representatives, responded with a tweet that read: \u201cMy AR is ready for you Robert Francis.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke called the tweet a \u201cdeath threat.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "Sen, Joe Manchin and Sen.
