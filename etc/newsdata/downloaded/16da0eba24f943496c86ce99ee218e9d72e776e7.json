National Iranian Oil Tanker Company via WANA (West Asia News Agency) via REUTERS\n\nThe tanker Sabiti was targeted on Friday, Iranian media reported earlier, an incident that if confirmed will stoke friction in a region rattled by attacks on tankers and oil installations since May.\n\n\u201cThe tanker is heading for Persian Gulf waters and we hope it will enter Iranian waters safely,\u201d Mehr quoted an unnamed official as saying. \u201cThe cargo leakage has stopped.\u201d\n\nThe incident, yet to be independently confirmed, is the latest involving oil tankers in the Red Sea and Gulf region, and may ratchet up tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia, long-time regional adversaries fighting a proxy war in Yemen, which lies at the southern end of the Red Sea.\n\nThe United States, embroiled in a dispute with Iran over its nuclear plans, has blamed Iran for attacks on tankers in the Gulf in May and June and as well as strikes on Saudi oil sites in September. Tehran has denied having a role in any of them.\n\nSaudi Arabia had no immediate comment on Friday\u2019s reported attack on the Iranian-owned tanker. The U.S. Navy\u2019s Fifth Fleet, which operates in the region, said it was aware of the reports but had no further information.\n\nPolitical risk consultancy Eurasia Group said it did not have firm evidence about who may have been behind the incident.\n\n\u201cThe proximity of the tanker at the time of the attack to Saudi Arabia\u2019s Jeddah port might imply that the missiles could possibly have been launched from the kingdom.\n\n\u201cAnother plausible theory is that it was an Israeli sabotage operation...The purpose would be to disrupt Iranian tanker activity in the Red Sea corridor as it heads towards the Suez Canal. A third possibility would be that the attack was conducted by a terrorist group,\u201d Eurasia said in a statement.\n\nThe reports offered sometimes diverging accounts. Iranian state-run television, citing the national oil company, said the tanker was hit by missiles while denying a report they came from Saudi Arabia.\n\nIran\u2019s Foreign Ministry said the ship was hit twice, without saying what struck it. State television broadcast images from the Sabiti\u2019s deck saying they were taken after the attack but showing no visible damage. The ship\u2019s hull was not in view.\n\nThe Red Sea is a major global shipping route for oil and other trade, linking the Indian Ocean with the Mediterranean via the Suez Canal. Crude prices jumped briefly on the news of the alleged attack and industry sources said it could drive up already high shipping costs.\n\nThere was no claim of responsibility for the reported incident, which follows attacks on tankers in the Gulf in May and June, as well as strikes on Saudi oil sites in September.", "description": "Leakage of cargo from an Iranian-owned oil tanker apparently hit by missiles in Red Sea waters off Saudi Arabia has been stopped as it heads for the Gulf, the semi-official Iranian news agency Mehr reported on Saturday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191012&t=2&i=1439993478&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9B08P", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
