Most companies today no longer seek to assemble conglomerates.\"\n\nElliott Management, In a letter released Monday\n\n\"Indeed, many of the actions outlined are ones we are already executing today. AT&T's Board and management team firmly believe that the focused and successful execution of our strategy is the best path forward to create long-term value for shareholders.\"\n\nAT&T\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThe fund predicted that if AT&T pursues the strategic and operational improvements Elliott suggests, the shares could be worth more than $60 by the end of 2021.\n\nThe challenge to the company's strategy comes less than a week after AT&T named longtime executive John Stankey to its newly created chief operating officer position, a move widely seen as preparing him to eventually succeed Stephenson. Elliott questioned the executive change and asked whether AT&T conducted an external review for the new No. 2 position.\n\nA fuller story is available on WSJ.com\n\nWSJ City: The news, the key facts and why it matters.
