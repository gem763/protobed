But while you may have an OLED screen in your pocket or hanging on your wall, you likely don\u2019t have one in that other device you spend hours looking at every day: your laptop.\n\nThere have been a few laptops released over the years with OLED screens in them, but none ever became particularly popular or sold very well. Early OLED laptops struggled with high battery consumption and high prices, which made them hard to accept compared to the more price- and power-efficient LCD screen options.\n\nThat\u2019s looking to change, though, as this year, there are a number of new laptops on the market with OLED screen options and without exorbitant markups. Lenovo, Razer, and HP all have announced or released OLED laptops in the first half of this year with similar display specs across the board. They all have 15-inch touchscreen panels with 4K resolution and 60Hz refresh rates. (Yes, they are all using basically the same Samsung panel, which is what dictates the size, resolution, and other display specs.) That\u2019s larger and has a higher resolution than what we\u2019ve seen in prior laptops with OLED screens.\n\nI\u2019ve been testing out the HP Spectre x360 15 AMOLED (what a name) for the past few weeks, which puts one of those panels in the refreshed Spectre x360 design that was released late last year. It\u2019s priced at $1,999, a not-insignificant $400 premium over an LCD-equipped version with the same specs (though the OLED model does come with 1TB of storage versus 512GB in the LCD version).\n\nThe Spectre x360 15\u2019s display is tremendous, and I see no reason why someone would pick an LCD over this OLED, given the option. It\u2019s absolutely worth the higher cost. The screen is bright, colorful, pixel-dense, and has those trademark rich blacks that have made OLED screens so desirable in phones and TVs. Unfortunately, the wonderful screen doesn\u2019t make up for the HP\u2019s abysmal trackpad, so I don\u2019t recommend running out and buying this laptop in any configuration. But what it does show is that OLED laptops\u2019 time has come.\n\nOur review of HP Spectre X360 15 OLED Verge Score 6 out of 10 Good Stuff OLED screen is beautiful\n\nSnappy performance for productivity work\n\nPhysical camera switch provides nice privacy option Bad Stuff The trackpad is the absolute worst\n\nOnly average battery life\n\nCan\u2019t get the best screen with the best processor option Buy for $1,999.99 from Best Buy\n\nThe most noticeable thing when you first start using the Spectre is how punchy and vibrant the screen is. Colors look like they are popping off the screen, but they aren\u2019t so overly saturated that they appear cartoonish. On the opposite end of the spectrum, the blacks are as inky and deep as they are on an OLED TV. Watching Netflix in 4K on this screen is truly a delight.\n\nIn terms of color reproduction, the OLED displays 100 percent of the wide-gamut DCI-P3 spectrum (compared to 82.2 percent on the LCD HP offers), which means the greens and reds are extra rich and deep. It has a rated contrast ratio of 462,989:1, which is what provides those deep blacks. It also emits less blue light than LCD screens, so much so that HP didn\u2019t feel the need to include any of the extra blue light-blocking filters or software that have started popping up on laptops with LCD panels.\n\nVibrant colors, great viewing angles, deep blacks \u2014 the Spectre\u2019s OLED screen has all of the things you\u2019re familiar with on OLED phones and TVs\n\nThe Spectre also has excellent viewing angles \u2014 which is useful if you\u2019re flipping it around into the various positions of a 2-in-1 computer \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t have any ghosting or weird artifacts when scrolling quickly. This isn\u2019t an ideal screen for gaming since its refresh rate is the standard 60Hz and not 144Hz, but for any other purpose, it\u2019s incredible.\n\nOn paper, the x360\u2019s screen isn\u2019t as bright as on other premium laptops, like the MacBook Pro. It tops out at just over 350 nits, which is plenty bright to use in any sort of indoor environment, but it might be tough to see outdoors on a sunny day.\n\nThere are other compromises for the OLED screen as well. The x360 configuration with the OLED option has a midrange quad-core Core i7 processor and entry-level Nvidia MX150 discrete graphics, as opposed to the six-core chip and 1050-series GPU you can get with the highest-end x360. HP told me it limited the chip options because the OLED screen is more power-hungry than the LCD it uses in the other model, and it wanted to maintain a certain level of battery life. So you can either have the fastest internal components or the best screen, but not both at the same time, which is frustrating.\n\nThat isn\u2019t to say the Spectre is slow. It\u2019s more than adequate for daily productivity work, photo editing, and even some light video editing. But if you really need processing power, it won\u2019t be as fast as other laptops in this class or even HP\u2019s higher-end x360.\n\nFor battery life, I averaged just over six hours between charges in my daily usage, which consists of browsing the web in Chrome, using Slack, email, Word, and Twitter with the screen at 50 percent brightness. That\u2019s about average for a 15-inch laptop in my experience, so the OLED screen isn\u2019t really hitting the battery too much more than normal. (HP rates the battery life at 13.5 hours, but that\u2019s based on a looping video test, not actual work, so take it with a grain of salt.) I\u2019d expect longer battery life from a smaller, more portable laptop, which makes the battery performance of this generation of OLED screens match the size available nicely.\n\nThe rest of the Spectre x360 15 AMOLED is basically the same as the Spectre x360 13 I reviewed earlier this year, with the exception of the additional number pad next to the keyboard and a full-size HDMI port in addition to the two Thunderbolt 3 ports.\n\nThe keyboard is easy enough to type on, the hinge is flexible and sturdy at the same time, and there are enough ports available that I can leave dongles at home. It also has a physical switch to turn off the webcam, precluding the need to put a gross sticker or cover over it.\n\nThe Spectre suffers from the age-old HP problem: a terrible trackpad\n\nFrustratingly \u2014 and if you\u2019ve read any of my prior HP reviews, you know what I\u2019m about to say \u2014 the trackpad is abysmal. I\u2019d go far enough to say it\u2019s even worse than the 13-inch model\u2019s. It is large and has a smooth glass finish and reassuring click, but scrolling with it is miserably choppy, multifinger gestures are slow and frustrating to execute, and it has poor palm rejection. It\u2019s bad enough for me to say that you should not buy this computer, full stop. (Scrolling in the beta version of Microsoft\u2019s Chromium-based Edge browser is basically nonfunctional as two fingers are always read as a right click, not a scroll, but since that\u2019s still technically in beta, I\u2019ll give HP a pass on that one.)\n\nThe root of these problems, once again, appears to be HP\u2019s use of Synaptics drivers instead of Microsoft\u2019s far superior Windows Precision drivers, which almost all of the Windows laptop world has switched over to. HP appears to finally be changing course with some of its most recent models and finally adopting Precision trackpads, but sadly, this Spectre isn\u2019t one of those.\n\nSo you should look at the Spectre x360 15 AMOLED as a good example of a laptop with an OLED screen that\u2019s practical, relatively affordable, and doesn\u2019t make any major compromises for the better display. As I noted earlier, HP is not the only laptop maker with an OLED laptop this year, and with prices coming down on the panels themselves, I\u2019m sure there will be plenty more to choose from in the near future.", "description": "HP\u2019s latest Spectre x360 15 is one of a handful of new laptops out this year with OLED screens, and its display is gorgeous. But in typical HP fashion, the trackpad is bad enough to make the whole thing impossible to recommend.", "authors": ["Dan Seifert", "Jun"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kdprCW-l9mkp6YAM8o7mprbfKG0=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16333419/akrales_190610_3467_0066.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-27"}
