Forward facing: three out of five stars.\n\nPros: Special harness \u201cremembers\u201d last setting, EPP foam, up-front five-position recline and harness adjustment (no re-threading). Half the price of similar Britax seats.\n\nCons: Tension knob is hard to adjust when seat is in rear facing mode. Wide base may not fit in smaller cars. Can only use the top harness slot when forward facing, making the seat difficult to use for larger (but young) infants. Deep recline only works when rear-facing.\n\nComments: The Triumph used to be Evenflo\u2019s flagship convertible car seat offering, but has since been eclipsed by all-in-one seats like the Symphony and the newer SafeMax. The Triumph soldiers on Evenflo\u2019s top-priced convertible ($105 to $150) with an impressive list of features. Of course, $150 being Evenflo\u2019s top line is still affordable, since $150 is the entry-level price for brands like Britax.\n\nAs always, Evenflo makes the Triumph in a series of versions, four at last count. Hence, you\u2019ll see a basic, stripped-down Triumph on Amazon for $105 . . . and then the top-of-the-line version for $150.\n\nThe Triumph\u2019s key feature are the TensionRight knobs on either side of the seat that tighten the harness from the side of the seat and the infinite slide harness adjustment system (no rethreading). All the knobs on the Evenflo seat have both fans and detractors\u2014give it a try in the store to see if you find it easy to adjust.\n\nAnother stand-out: a no rethread harness. Yes, even on the $130 version sold at Walmart, which is probably the lowest price convertible on the market with this handy feature.\n\nThe cheapest Triumph has clip-on cup holders, basic fabric and basic LATCH connectors. Step up to the Triumph with SureSafe and you get premium LATCH connectors (SureSafe). The ProComfort Triumph LX adds \u201cgel matrix\u201d seat padding and integrated cup holders. The most expensive Triumph (Platinum Triumph) has \u201cOutLast\u201d fabrics that absorb heat and cold temps for $150.\n\nSo, should you buy one? Looking at parent feedback, we see quite a split opinion on this seat. Take ease of use, for example. The current Triumph scores just three out of five stars for ease of use in the NHTSA\u2019s evaluation. Consumer Reports echoed that view, with average ease of use ratings weighing down the seat\u2019s overall score (21st out of 32 seats ranked). That\u2019s probably due to the difficulty in adjusting the TensionRight knob when the seat is rear facing. Another negative: the wide seat width (19.5\u201d) means this seat will eat up much of your backseat, a problem if you drive a small to mid-size vehicle.\n\nOn the plus side, the Evenflo Triumph scored a \u201cbest\u201d rating in Consumer Reports latest crash tests, which is the top rating.\n\nFans say this seat is easy to install and the no-reathread harness is a big plus, especially at this price. Critics point out the Triumph has frustrating limitations. The Triumph has two recline position, but the deepest recline feature on the Triumph only works when the seat is rear-facing. And you can\u2019t switch between the semi-reclined and upright position without uninstalling and reinstalling the seat . . . . which is crazy.\n\nThe new \u201cOutlast\u201d fabrics on the Platinum Triumph don\u2019t wash well, reports more than one parent dismayed at frayed fabric. Some even said the Outlast fabric frays without washing. You\u2019d think Evenflo would have done more testing on this special expensive fabric before touting it as a premium feature. And the integrated cup holders sound great in theory\u2014but in the real world, they don\u2019t even hold a sippy cup. The Triumph lacks harness covers or belt lock-offs, that latter of which ease belt installations.\n\nBottom line: the Triumph is an affordable seat whose ace in the hole is its no-reathread (\u201cinfinite slide\u201d) harness. But various glitches mar this seat and prevent us from recommending it. Rating: C", "description": "Convertible Car Seat review: Evenflo Triumph.
