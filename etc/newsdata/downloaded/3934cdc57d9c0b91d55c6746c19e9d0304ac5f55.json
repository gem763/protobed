It doesn\u2019t matter. It doesn\u2019t matter when it\u2019s released and it won\u2019t matter what\u2019s in it.\n\nListen, I hate to be Debbie Downer here but the anticipation surrounding this report is rooted in the hope and sincere belief that its pages contain such shocking detail of government abuses and corruption within our intelligence agencies the nation will roil as one with cries for justice and vindication for Donald Trump!\n\nSorry. It\u2019s not going to happen. Of course there were flagrant abuses. There\u2019s already ample evidence the 2016 Clinton campaign was guilty of foreign collusion and our FBI used the outcome of that collusion to knowingly mislead a FISA court to obtain warrants. We know those warrants were then used to spy on American citizens within the Trump campaign. This was followed by well-documented leaking to the press, lying, internal political collusion and the setting of perjury traps by Barack Obama\u2019s CIA and DOJ.\n\nBut again, we already know these things occurred. Will we learn of even worse abuse? Perhaps. Will anything change? Nope. Not just because Democrats and the media will ignore it. Sadly, so will the Republicans.\n\nAttorney General Bill Barr, whom I consider the most important public servant next to Donald Trump in a generation, is being viewed skeptically by many Trump backers because of his lack of media air time and that we\u2019ve not heard details of any heads rolling inside DOJ. I\u2019ve heard it said by many skeptical MAGA voters that Barr\u2019s no different than the rest of the deep state if there aren\u2019t indictments. Lock them up or else!\n\nBarr is a thorough, patient, methodical guy. He\u2019s not going to rush this because we want him to. He\u2019s not thinking about the next election. I have no doubt he\u2019s trying to clean up the DOJ and expose the craven behavior of those in the highest ranks of the organization. But even if he exposes criminality, it\u2019s not going to sway a single Democrat currently in the process of gas lighting the country over Ukraine.\n\nPresident Trump is right when he says Democrats fight dirty. Their two biggest attributes are \u201cthey\u2019re vicious and they stick together. They don\u2019t have Mitt Romney in their midst,\u201d Trump said Monday during his cabinet meeting.\n\nHe\u2019s referring to the pathetic story of former Republican presidential candidate and now Utah Senator Mitt Romney\u2019s admission that he uses a fake Twitter account to monitor his favorite personalities, such as squish, RINO-types who write for the Washington Post. He apparently likes to bravely tweet correct-the-record comments to those critical of him without being seen. Some kind of petty, personal therapy session, I suppose. A real profile in courage.\n\nHe also loves to be seen on cable TV as 2019\u2019s version of McCain attacking President Trump whenever invited. Much like his late predecessor, he couldn\u2019t win a presidential election so he decided to build a career attacking those who could - especially if the winners are in his own party.\n\nIn Romney\u2019s case, much like McCain\u2019s before him, the addiction to being in the spotlight and being viewed as the Republican his Democratic colleagues and mainstream media would respect was always far more important than whether or not the electorate respected him.\n\nThe other question beginning to percolate in many conservative circles is \u201cWhat\u2019s Lindsey Graham up to?\u201d The powerful chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee has been threatening for months to haul this character or that character up to the Hill to testify. There\u2019s only one problem. He\u2019s never called anyone to testify and doesn\u2019t appear ready to do so any time soon.\n\nFormer chair of the committee and long-serving Republican Senator Chuck Grassley tweeted this week, \u201cAll of the delays and excuses why the Horowitz IG report isn\u2019t public yet after several months of anticipation of its issues leads me to the suspicion it\u2019s going to be \u201cdeep six\u201d by the deep state.\u201d\n\nWell, what are you and your colleagues doing about it over there in Judiciary, senator? You don\u2019t need to wait for the report to begin hearings with the suspected players in this sordid tale of government abuses. But you\u2019re not acting either. Why?\n\nFormer D.C. bureau chief for Investor\u2019s Business Daily, Paul Sperry, tweeted his theory of the inaction. \u201cPerhaps the reason Graham won\u2019t hold hearings to get to the bottom of the origins of #Spygate and the political espionage conducted against Trump is because we might learn he was working with his bosom buddy McCain to push the dossier to smear Trump.\u201d\n\nI hate how correct I fear Mr. Sperry may be. And I really hate how likely it is Graham isn\u2019t the only Republican of whom we should be suspicious.\n\nA new Rasmussen poll released this week finds just over half of voters still believe in the likelihood of an illegal, high-level effort to stop the Trump presidency, but not nearly as many expect anyone to be punished for it.\n\nThose likely voters are correct. It did happen. But nothing will happen to the guilty parties - except next year\u2019s election. That\u2019s voters\u2019 only recourse. Donald Trump came to drain the swamp and there\u2019s plenty more work to be done. Unfortunately, his party swims in the very same swamp.\n\nIt\u2019s up to voters to help the president drain it. We\u2019ll drown in it waiting for the GOP.", "description": "More than a few exasperated pro-Trump folks have been asking, .10/23/2019 10:46:21AM EST.", "authors": ["Chris Stigall", "Guy Benson", "Matt Vespa", "Leah Barkoukis"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/112/10dfd6ea-bae0-40e6-a83c-41b1ea122367.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
