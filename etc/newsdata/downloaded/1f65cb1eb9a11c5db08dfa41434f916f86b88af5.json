Ivanka had a book coming out. Don and Eric were working on a line of patriotically themed budget hotels. And preliminary talks were underway to launch a Trump-branded TV network that would turn disgruntled voters into viewers. Now they needed a new plan.\u201d Apparently it\u2019s one modeled after the Kennedys and the Bushes, only with a much bigger budget for hair and makeup.\n\nBest of luck, Trumpkins. I just don\u2019t see it. Ivanka \u2014 or, as I like to think of her, Our Lady of the DMZ \u2014 has shown a shocking tone-deafness during her White House romp. And Don Jr. was the nitwit emailing ecstatically and then lying badly about that June 2016 meeting with the Russian, um, adoption evangelists. These two have all of Dad\u2019s gall but only a scintilla of his guile.\n\nTrump won\u2019t hang around by proxy, in a next generation of opportunists with his surname or agenda. That would negate the whole point of his pivot into politics. It wasn\u2019t to promote ideas; it was to promote himself. Health permitting, he\u2019ll move heaven and earth to maintain his omnipresence in American life, by which I mean he\u2019ll be as outrageous as he must to stay in the news. And we in the media will confront a decision: Give him what he wants, or let go of him and all the eyeballs he draws?\n\nEven if we let go, there\u2019s the strong possibility, as Coppins noted, that he\u2019ll establish his own media enterprise, with a network where the news really is fake, adulation doesn\u2019t hinge on nuisances like the ballot box and Sean Hannity isn\u2019t the model for Trump veneration . He\u2019s the baseline.\n\nFrom that coddled perch Trump can take out his big black Sharpie and write higher vote counts over his actual, official ones. He can draw horns on John Bolton and a halo over William Barr. He can sketch a second White House adjacent to the first one but taller, with gold trim.\n\nThat\u2019s where he\u2019ll be living, his power fictive but his presence ineluctable, snappily ever after.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
