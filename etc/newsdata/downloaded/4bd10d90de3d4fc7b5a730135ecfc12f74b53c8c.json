The organization also added the \u201cDylann Roof Bowlcut,\u201d a man with a moon-shaped head and an image of a Jewish man greedily rubbing his hands together.\n\nMany of the new symbols in the database are associated with the alt-right, and several are popular on anonymous message boards including 4chan and 8chan, according to the ADL. Some of the images and slogans have spread to mainstream websites, such as Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\u201cThese are the latest calling cards of hate,\u201d Mark Pitcavage, senior fellow at ADL\u2019s Center on Extremism, said in a statement. \u201cWhile some hate symbols are short-lived, others take on a life of their own and become tools for online trolling.\u201d\n\nThe ADL previously resisted adding the \u201cokay\u201d symbol to its \u201cHate on Display\u201d database, which also includes swastikas, the Aryan Brotherhood\u2019s logo and the Nazi Party\u2019s flag. The idea that the gesture, made by touching the thumb and forefinger, secretly symbolizes white supremacy began as a troll campaign by some segments of the political right and far-right to incite a reaction from liberals and the media.\n\n[Chicago Cubs ban fan who made \u2018disgusting\u2019 hand gesture associated with white power on air]\n\nIn February 2017, 4chan\u2019s /pol/ board discussed ongoing tactics to try to get the idea to go viral. \u201cTo any who haven\u2019t seen the original thread, our goal is to convince people on twitter that the \u2018ok\u2019 hand sign has been co-opted by neo-Nazis,\u201d the original poster of the thread wrote.\n\nAs BuzzFeed has reported, /pol/ was gleeful when the \u201cokay\u201d hand sign started to get mainstream traction. As the campaign spread, however, the symbol was simultaneously adopted by the alt-right \u2014 an umbrella term for those on the far right who embrace white nationalist views \u2014 and supporters of President Trump on the Internet. Both seem to use the gesture primarily to \u201ctrigger\u201d liberals who believe the hand sign serves as a decoder ring to detect secret Nazis.\n\n\u201cThat was what the OK symbol was literally invented to do: Both serve at a white supremacist symbol and also one that is just ordinary-enough looking that when liberals expressed outrage, the white supremacist could play the victim of liberal hysteria,\u201d Amanda Marcotte, a politics writer for Salon, wrote on Twitter in September 2018.\n\nProminent figures and private citizens alike have made headlines for making the \u201cokay\u201d gesture in public. Critics accused Republican operative Zina Bash of making the symbol for white power last year when she made the \u201cokay\u201d sign at Brett M. Kavanaugh\u2019s Supreme Court confirmation hearing. A spokesperson for the Senate Judiciary Committee said at the time that Bash was aiming the sign at a staffer who fulfilled a request for the judge \u2014 an explanation that aligned with video of the hearing in which Bash is visible.\n\nThe same month, a Coast Guard member was removed from Hurricane Florence relief efforts after he flashed the \u201cokay\u201d sign during a televised media briefing. A Chicago Cubs fan in May was banned from Wrigley Field when he made the gesture behind an NBC Sports Chicago analyst during a TV segment.\n\n[Zina Bash moved her hand \u2014 and the #Resistance saw a white power symbol. Then she did it again.]\n\nLongtime Republican political consultant Roger Stone and several members of the far-right group the Proud Boys flashed the \u201cokay\u201d sign last year in a photo taken at a bar. Stone denied the symbol was associated with white supremacy. He told Salon they made the gesture because Trump often uses it, and it has come to signify support for him.\n\nThe \u201cokay\u201d gesture also has been used as a clear symbol of racism. Avowed neo-Nazi Brenton Harrison Tarrant, who is accused of killing 51 people at two New Zealand mosques, made the \u201cokay\u201d sign at a court appearance in March.\n\nNeo-Nazi Richard Spencer, president of the white supremacist think tank the National Policy Institute, flashed the gesture in a photo taken outside Trump International Hotel in the District on the night of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nTo add yet another layer of nuance, some people use the \u201cokay\u201d sign as part of the \u201cCircle Game,\u201d in which a person makes a circle with their fingers and holds their hand below their waist. If someone looks at the circle, the first person punches their shoulder. The game was popularized by the TV series \u201cMalcolm in the Middle.\u201d\n\nEli Rosenberg contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe one word that lets politicians get away with breaking the rules on social media\n\nThese Dutch vloggers wanted to visit Area 51.
