We know we have not done a good job in explaining our position and we will be working hard to ensure this process delivers results,\u201d Mr Elliott said.\n\nNAB chief customer officer and retail bank boss Mike Baird also welcomed the opportunity to present its case, saying context was critical to understanding how the banks were responding.\n\n\u201cThis is an important opportunity to discuss the challenges of an increasingly low interest rate environment and engage in a broader discussion about how we support all our customers - both depositors and borrowers,\u201d Mr Baird said.\n\nBanks are being careful to say mortgage price decisions need to balance the interests of depositors, borrowers, employees and shareholders. The big four\u2019s $30 billion annual cash profit is also being carefully framed as a major contributor to superannuation fund returns and retirement savings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlongside mortgage pricing the inquiry will also explore the discounts offered to new customers (known as front book-back book discounting) and whether or not there are any impediments to customers switching banks.\n\nThe ACCC last explored interest rate pricing in 2018 when it found what it described as \u2018synchronised\u2019 rate moves and a loyalty tax that dudded longstanding customers.\n\nUBS analyst Jonathan Mott said at a minimum he expected the inquiry to put more pressure on banks to pass on the next two rate cuts the firm is forecasting in November and in the first half of 2020.\n\nTreasurer Josh Frydenberg \"This is not a good outcome.\" AAP\n\n\u201cIn a worst case scenario where the banks are required to eliminate the front book/back book discount in full this could reduce net profit across the majors by $3.8 billion,\u201d Mr Mott said.\n\n\u201cWe see this as unlikely as banks could offset this by reducing the discounts offered to new customers, reduce deposit rates or reprice other products.\u201d\n\nFederal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg pulled the trigger on the competition inquiry following two weeks of intense campaigning for a fresh inquiry. He said the bank\u2019s failure to articulate their reasons for withholding portions of the cut properly was not a great look.\n\n\u201cThis is not a good outcome for either their customers or the economy as a whole, and comes just months after the royal commission shone a bright light on misconduct in the banking sector,\u201d the Treasurer said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWith this new inquiry, the government is providing the banks with an opportunity to transparently account for their decision-making and how they balance the needs of borrowers, savers, shareholders and the wider community.\u201d\n\nAustralian Banking Association CEO Anna Bligh said the complexities of mortgage rate pricing were not widely understood however she believed that Australians would have better knowledge of the process when the inquiry was completed.\n\nABA CEO Anna Bligh \"Australia\u2019s banks stand ready to assist the ACCC.\" Alex Ellinghausen\n\n\u201cBanks are ready to assist this inquiry, but their first priority is to continue to assist Australian homeowners and Australian businesses to borrow the money they need to get ahead in life,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cTheir other major priority is to ensure that the recommendations of the Royal Commission are implemented, implemented in full, implemented in letter and in spirit.\n\n\u201cAustralian banks are no strangers to inquiries, they are well versed in how to manage the requirements of an inquiry, and ensure that get on with the business of putting money into the economy so businesses can thrive and families can get ahead.\u201d", "description": "Brian Hartzer says pushing banks to cut interest rates for borrowers could backfire by pushing rates up instead.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.8005%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_23/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b961f8f368facb8b3f495e88cafc4b356217ae4d", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
