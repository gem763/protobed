Neither was Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez or Chris Taylor.\n\nAll are right-handed batters, and all knew that if the Washington Nationals persisted in their playoff pattern of using starters in relief, they might very well be called upon to pinch hit against $140 million lefty Patrick Corbin.\n\nSo in the first inning Sunday night, that trio headed to the indoor batting cage that sits near the staircase leading from the visitors\u2019 dugout to the clubhouse to try to prepare. And, boy, were they prepared when Corbin entered. So were other Dodgers hitters, producing a postseason inning unlike any other: seven runs, all scored with two outs and two strikes.\n\nJustin Turner\u2019s three-run homer capped a startling and record-setting rally in the sixth as the Dodgers roughed up the starter-turned-reliever and beat Washington 10-4 to grab a 2-1 lead in their best-of-five NLDS.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just always ready, no matter who\u2019s on the mound. Righty, lefty. You\u2019ve got to fake it sometimes, whether you\u2019re ready or not,\u201d said Freese who singled as a pinch hitter in the sixth and finished with four hits.\n\n\u201cDefinitely, two strikes, you\u2019ve got to take it seriously. You can\u2019t assume your AB\u2019s over,\u201d Freese said. \u201cYou look at the best guys in the game \u2026 they look like they like two strikes.\u201d\n\nHern\u00e1ndez also entered in that inning and contributed a two-run double, and Taylor walked as a pinch hitter against Corbin.\n\nRussell Martin started, his first appearance of these playoffs, and hit a two-run double in the sixth as LA became the first team in major league history to score seven two-out, two-strike runs in one postseason inning.\n\n\u201cWe never doubt ourselves,\u201d Freese said.\n\nMartin, who like Freese is 36, tacked on a two-run homer in the ninth. This is Martin\u2019s 10th postseason \u2014 Freese joked it might be his teammates 26th \u2014 and Freese\u2019s sixth.\n\nThe Dodgers can advance to the NL Championship Series for the fourth consecutive year by closing the best-of-five NLDS in Game 4 at Washington on Monday, when LA sends Rich Hill to the mound against Max Scherzer.\n\nAnd to think: Things were not looking all that good for the Dodgers, who entered the sixth trailing 2-1 after Juan Soto\u2019s two-run homer off eventual winner Hyun-Jin Ryu in the first and Max Muncy\u2019s solo shot off Washington starter An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez in the fifth.\n\nThat seemed to wake up LA\u2019s offense.\n\nWell, it was either that or the fact that S\u00e1nchez, who struck out nine, was gone to begin the sixth. In came Corbin, the lefty who started \u2014 and lost \u2014 the opener and hadn\u2019t made a relief appearance since 2017, when he only made one.\n\n\u201cJust couldn\u2019t seem to get that third out there,\u201d Corbin said. \u201cJust stinks.\u201d\n\nIt continued Nationals manager Dave Martinez\u2019s postseason penchant for pushing his starters to appear in relief, deemed necessary because of his club\u2019s NL-worst bullpen. The strategy had been working.\n\nNeedless to say, not this time against the Dodgers, who lost in the World Series each of the past two years and led the NL with 106 wins this season, 13 more than the Nationals.\n\n\u201cAn\u00edbal was at 87 pitches. He gave us all he had. We were at a good spot in the lineup, where we thought Corbin could get through it,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cAnd his stuff was good. \u2026 But he had every hitter 0-2. He just couldn\u2019t finish.\u201d\n\nAfter Cody Bellinger snapped his 0-for-8 start to the series with a single \u2014 he would add a double later in the inning \u2014 Corbin struck out the next two hitters. That\u2019s when it all fell apart for Washington.\n\nFreese, the MVP of the 2011 NLCS and World Series for St. Louis, singled to put runners on the corners.\n\n\u201cHe has to be going down as one of the greatest October players of all time,\u201d Muncy said. \u201cI don\u2019t care what anyone says. He has to be.\u201d\n\nMartin came through on a 2-2 slider that landed on the warning track in left-center, putting the visitors ahead 3-2. Hern\u00e1ndez connected on a 1-2 slider for yet another two-run double to left-center, a hit off the base off the wall.\n\nAfter Muncy was intentionally walked, Wander Suero entered and promptly served up a full-count fastball that Turner lofted to the back of the visiting bullpen beyond left field, making it 8-2.\n\n\u201cA couple guys came up and had really big at bats and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing all year,\u201d Muncy said. \u201cThat was one of those things where once one guy started doing it, the next cat picked up on it and it just kind of rolled throughout the inning.\u201d\n\nWHAT A RELIEF\n\nWith baseball\u2019s ERA leader this season, Ryu, done after going five innings and allowing two runs, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts pieced together the remaining 12 outs with five relievers. That included closer Kenley Jansen, who hadn\u2019t pitched in a game since Sept. 28. He threw a 1-2-3 ninth that included a pair of strikeouts.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nNationals: CF Victor Robles was out of the lineup with a strained right hamstring after getting hurt running to first base in Game 2. Michael A. Taylor started in Robles\u2019 place and went 1 for 4.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThree-time Cy Young Award winner Scherzer was pushed back from Game 3 to Game 4. Scherzer entered these playoffs with his teams having lost his most recent seven postseason appearances, but Washington is 2-0 when he pitches so far this October, including a start in the NL wild-card game against Milwaukee and a one-inning, three-strikeout relief appearance in Game 2 at Los Angeles. That bullpen use led the Nationals to switch Scherzer\u2019s start from Sunday to Monday. \u201cHe can beat you in the strike zone with three pitches. He can beat you out of the zone,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cHe\u2019s relentless.\u201d Hill went 4-1 with a 4.25 ERA this season in just 13 starts; he spent time on the IL with a sprained right knee and a strained left forearm, activated for the last time less than a month ago. Hill hasn\u2019t pitched more than three innings in an appearance since June. \u201cPitch count, whatever it is, I can\u2019t control that,\u201d the 39-year-old Hill said. \u201cWhatever I can give the team, I\u2019m going to give the team.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Howard Fendrich on Twitter at http://twitter.com/HowardFendrich\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 David Freese wasn't in the Los Angeles Dodgers' starting lineup for Game 3 of the NL Division Series.
