However, the latter two have cut their rates to 2.75pc. Nationwide also paid a 5pc rate but ended this in April.\n\nNow M&S Bank stands alone at 5pc, with the next-best rate being the 3pc offered from Virgin Money.\n\nThe trend for banks to cut rates on their best deals has already been seen this year with bonds, Isas and easy-access accounts.\n\nRachel Springall, of financial experts Moneyfacts, said: \u201cGenerally this market doesn\u2019t change. It just shows that most areas of the savings market are being attacked by rate cuts. If you are thinking of saving for next year you need to get your skates on as things are changing very, very quickly.\u201d", "description": "Banks are beginning to cut rates on the top regular-saver accounts, in a worrying move for consumers.", "authors": ["Sam Barker", "Guy Opperman", "Katie Morley"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/personal-banking/2019/08/30/050819_ADB_Money_Pension-fees_PORTAL-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwfSVWeZ_vEN7c6bHu2jJnT8.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-08-30"}
