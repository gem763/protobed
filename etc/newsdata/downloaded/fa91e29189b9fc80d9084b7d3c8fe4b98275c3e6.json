The presence of these raises the risk of cognitive decline, dementia, and stroke.\n\nWe should be getting seven to eight hours of sleep a night (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nResearchers looked at 5,247 Hispanic participants, all between the ages of 45 and 75, assessing their attention, memory, language, reaction time, and perception. Participants were also given a neurocognitive test at the start and end of the study, and were asked to fill out weekly questionnaires about their sleeping habits over the last week, including what time they normally go to bed, what time they wake up, and if they have any naps during the day.\n\nJust 15% of participants slept for an average of nine hours each night, and this group saw their cognitive performance across all fields fall by the end of the seven years. Their memory decreased by 13% while their word fluency dropped by 20%.\n\nDr Ramos, a neurologist and sleep expert at the University of Miami, said: \u2018Insomnia and prolonged sleep duration appear to be linked to a decline in neurocognitive functioning that can precede the onset of Alzheimer\u2019s disease or other dementias.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We observed that prolonged periods of sleep and chronic insomnia symptoms led to declines in memory, executive function and processing speed.\n\n\u2018Those measures can precede the development of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\u2019\n\n\u2018We may also be able to identify at-risk patients who may benefit from early intervention to prevent or reduce the risk of dementia.\u2019\n\n\n\nWhat are the symptoms of dementia? Dementia is an umbrella term for a set of symptoms that affect cognitive function, such as memory loss, confusion and changes to personality.\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for around two thirds of all cases. Common early symptoms of dementia: Memory loss\n\nDifficulty concentrating\n\nFind it hard to carry out familiar daily tasks\n\nStruggling to follow a conversation or find the right word\n\nBeing confused about time or and place\n\nMood changes Symptoms of advanced dementia: Memory problems to the point that people may not recognise close family and friends or remember where they live\n\nCommunication problems\n\nMobility problems\n\nBehavioural problems, such as agitation, depression, anxiety, wandering around, and aggression\n\nIncontinence\n\nWeight loss\n\nWhat's the difference between Alzheimer's and dementia? Alzheimer\u2019s is a form of dementia, and the most common type. Dementia is a group of symptoms that affect mental cognitive tasks \u2013 it\u2019s a syndrome and not a disease. It\u2019s the umbrella term which diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s fall under. There are other types of dementia, too, and each has their own symptoms to look out for. Common types of dementia and their symptoms: Alzheimer\u2019s disease Memory problems\n\nAsking the same questions over and over\n\nBecoming confused in unfamiliar environments\n\nBecoming withdrawn or anxious\n\nDifficulty with tasks that require planning and organisation\n\nDifficulty finding the right word\n\nDifficulty with numbers Vascular dementia Stroke-like symptoms such as muscle weakness or temporary paralysis on one side of the body\n\nDifficulty walking or a change in how someone walks\n\nStruggles with attention, planning, and reasoning\n\nMood changes Dementia with Lewy bodies Fluctuating levels of confusion, with periods of being alert or drowsy\n\nVisual hallucinations\n\nSlowness in physical movement\n\nRepeated falls and fainting\n\nSleep disturbances Other types of dementia include frontotemporal dementia, early onset dementia, mild cognitive impairment, traumatic brain injury, Parkinson\u2019s disease dementia, Korsakoff syndrome, and Huntington\u2019s disease dementia.\n\nMORE: Getting enough sleep and forgiving your enemies are among the secrets to happiness\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: This is what less than six hours of sleep does to your body\n\nMORE: Mum reveals simple hack for helping toddlers sleep on longhaul flights\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "New research suggests that excess sleep could increase your risk of developing dementia.", "authors": ["Ellen Scott"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sleepy-24ed_1570778211.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
