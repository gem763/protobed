This year, it\u2019s the turn of Ad Astra, written and directed by James Gray, and starring Brad Pitt as Major Roy McBride, astronaut extraordinaire. Ad Astra is almost as intelligent as those other films, but it shares too much of their imagery to seem entirely original. And, like them, it veers towards questions of parenthood and loss, a trajectory that is starting to become irritating. Isn\u2019t anyone allowed to journey to the final frontier without getting choked up about their relatives along the way?\n\nMore like this:\n\n- The Truth review: four stars\n\n- Are Mafia dramas getting too real?\n\n- Quentin Tarantino\u2019s true masterpiece\n\nThe personal issues are handled less elegantly in Ad Astra than in the other films, too. In theory, Pitt\u2019s character is similar to Neil Armstrong, as portrayed by Ryan Gosling in First Man, in that his piloting abilities are dependent on his iron control of his feelings. The difference is that Gosling conveyed that stoicism by being, well, stoic, whereas Pitt conveys it by going on and on about how stoic he is, both in the voice-overs that recur throughout, and the psych-evaluation reports he recites to his computer whenever he is about to go on another mission. Meanwhile, Liv Tyler pops up in a tiny, clich\u00e9d cameo as the angelic wife who Roy has neglected. The setting may be the near future, but roles such as that one are out of date.\n\nWhat follows is, essentially, a Buck Rogers-style yarn, complete with crash-landings and shoot-outs\n\nIf you overlook some of the soppy psycho-babble, though, Ad Astra is a rewarding combination of pulpy B-movie and ominous, atmospheric drama. It begins as Roy is knocked off a mile-high antenna by a power surge. According to Nasa\u2019s top brass, this was one of the many power surges caused by cosmic rays zapping us from the other end of the solar system. And the origin of these cosmic rays is a space station that was once manned by Roy\u2019s father (Tommy Lee Jones).\n\nAs far as anyone knows, McBride Sr died 13 years earlier. But what if he didn\u2019t? What if he\u2019s still out there, orbiting Neptune, like an interstellar descendant of Colonel Kurtz or Ben Gunn? Roy doesn\u2019t ask his superiors why they think the old man might still be alive, and nobody bothers to tell him \u2013 Gunn\u2019s screenplay is frustratingly vague about such matters \u2013 but he is sent off into the unknown, just in case, to try to contact his long-lost dad.\n\nWhat follows is, essentially, a Buck Rogers-style yarn, complete with crash-landings, shoot-outs, zero-gravity brawls, a savage predator hiding in a seemingly abandoned craft, and a car chase on the Moon (and you don\u2019t see those very often). It\u2019s rollicking stuff, but Gray keeps the mood sombre and the science just about plausible. There is no hyperdrive and no teleporting, for instance, so if you want to go on a billion-mile trip, it\u2019s going to take you a very long time indeed. Reminiscent of both 2001: A Space Odyssey and Tarkovsky\u2019s Solaris, the film is at its most captivating when it shows how dark and desolate existence can be as you move farther away from the sun. Once you\u2019re in space, you are in a truly alien environment, even if you don\u2019t meet any aliens.\n\nThen, alas, Roy's self-pitying voiceover returns, and brings everything back to earth. Ad Astra is enjoyable as a two-fisted action movie and as a hard sci-fi rumination. But, weighed down as it is by emotional baggage, it doesn\u2019t quite get to the stars.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\n\nLove film?
