But a Brexit Party scarf, tie and socks did not feature countries of origin on their labels.\n\nA recent report said textile workers in Leicester are paid less than the UK minimum wage as factories break the law to compete with dirt-cheap imports.\n\nMeanwhile, the UK this year experienced its largest contraction in three years as car plants shut down and production dropped 24% amid Brexit fears. In June, we told how campaigners funding Mr Farage were selling \u00a320 T-shirts made in Bangladesh.\n\nThe tees were on sale from the Leave.EU campaign, which boasts it is \u201cbacking Britain\u201d and wants more jobs here.\n\nLeave.EU is bankrolled by tycoon Arron Banks, who donated \u00a3450,000 to Mr Farage after his European election triumph with the Brexit Party.\n\n(Image: Steve Bainbridge)\n\nThat victory came 10 years after he promised \u201cBritish jobs for British\n\npeople\u201d while campaigning for departure from the EU.\n\nThe Brexit Party is registered as a company rather than a political party and was criticised after it emerged anybody in the world could join with a \u00a325 PayPal donation.\n\nIn August, it launched its membership club, charging \u00a3100 a month for VIP access to conferences and rallies, a quarterly letter from chairman Richard Tice, invitations to \u201cexclusive party events\u201d and a \u201cbespoke welcome gift\u201d.\n\nThe Brexit Party said: \u201cOur button badges, rear window stickers, tea towels, travel mugs and scarves are all manufactured in the UK.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to international free trade, we don\u2019t want to be stuck behind a protectionist trade wall. The Lib Dems are little Europeans. Despite this, much of their own merchandise comes from overseas, notably the Far East.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Brexit Party T-shirts, hoodies and caps are being manufactured in Bangladesh and China, in a move contradicting leader Nigel Farage's 'British jobs for British people' stance", "authors": ["Alan Selby", "Image", "Steve Bainbridge \u00c2", "Steve Bainbridge"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20567432.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SMX_SB_Brexit_Merch_02.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
