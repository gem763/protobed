Col. Oliver North, during testimony on Capitol Hill in 1987. (Lana Harris/AP)\n\nPlato Cacheris, for decades one of Washington\u2019s premier defense lawyers, with prominent legal roles in the Watergate and Iran-contra scandals and President Bill Clinton\u2019s affair with White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky, died Sept. 26 at a nursing home in Alexandria, Va. He was 90.\n\nThe cause was pneumonia, said his wife, Ethel Cacheris.\n\nMr. Cacheris, the son of Greek immigrants, belonged to a select coterie of Washington lawyers who created their own peculiar legal specialty, made it highly respectable and went on to dominate it for decades: a white-collar defense bar for those ensnared in the capital\u2019s major political cases.\n\nFor much of the early 20th century, prestigious law firms generally regarded criminal defense work as undesirable, even slightly tawdry \u2014 the domain, as Mr. Cacheris once put it, \u201cof rather slick characters.\u201d\n\nThe members of his small fraternity \u2014 and in those early days, they were nearly all men \u2014 represented the principal figures in the major dramas that increasingly played out when law and politics intersected in a courtroom.\n\nIn their stolid public manner and bespoke dark suits, Mr. Cacheris and his counterparts took as their model Edward Bennett Williams, the nationally known Washington lawyer who showed that representing high-profile criminal defendants could bring cachet and prosperity.\n\n\n\nMr. Cacheris, at microphone, and fellow lawyer John Hundley address the media before a hearing in the case of accused spy Robert P. Hanssen in 2001. (Robert A. Reeder/The Washington Post)\n\nIn the Watergate break-in and coverup, Mr. Cacheris represented former attorney general John N. Mitchell; in Abscam, which involved federal agents masquerading as wealthy oil sheikhs offering bribes to members of Congress, he represented then-Rep. Michael O. \u201cOzzie\u201d Myers (D-Pa.); in the international scandal involving the rogue bank B.C.C.I., he represented Sheik Kamal Adham, the former Saudi intelligence chief; and in Iran-contra, he was the lawyer for Fawn Hall, a secretary to Lt. Col. Oliver L. North at the National Security Council.\n\nMr. Cacheris also formed a high-profile subspecialty in espionage cases. His clients included Aldrich H. Ames of the CIA and Robert P. Hanssen of the FBI, both of whom spied for the Soviets and then the Russians, and Ana Bel\u00e9n Montes of the Defense Intelligence Agency, who spied for Cuba.\n\nProsecutors often were pleased to face Mr. Cacheris \u2014 not because he was anything less than a formidable adversary, but because he was experienced and deft in the ways of high-stakes legal contests, from candid plea negotiations to, if necessary, showdowns in the courtroom.\n\n\u201cYou could always rely on whatever he told you,\u201d recalled Chuck Rosenberg, a former federal prosecutor in Virginia. \u201cMoreover, his life showed attorneys that one can be civil and decent and also greatly effective.\u201d\n\nHis skill at dealing constructively with prosecutors was on vivid display when he represented Lewinsky, who initially denied to law-enforcement authorities her dalliance in the Oval Office with Clinton. She found herself facing felony charges as a target of independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr.\n\nLewinsky was first represented by William H. Ginsburg, a medical-malpractice lawyer from California and family friend. Ginsburg, who had little experience in either Washington or criminal law, made a marathon of media appearances and proved spectacularly unsuccessful in helping Lewinsky\u2019s cause. Prosecutors refused to deal with him after he publicly called Starr \u201ca monster.\u201d\n\nThe Lewinsky family jettisoned him in June 1998 and hired Mr. Cacheris and his longtime friend Jacob A. Stein, another pillar of the elite D.C. defense bar. In short order, they obtained for Lewinsky complete immunity from prosecution in exchange for testifying truthfully and completely.\n\nAlthough critics tried to depict Mr. Cacheris and others in his field as accomplished mostly at dealmaking, he ably demonstrated his trial skills when necessary.\n\nIn 1985, Mr. Cacheris successfully defended David K. Davoudlarian in a civil case brought by his stepdaughters, who said that the Virginia gynecologist had strangled his wife in their Annandale home two years earlier.\n\n\u201cMy client is insensitive, a fool, an ass, a boor,\u201d Mr. Cacheris told the jury. \u201cBut he is not a coldblooded strangler.\u201d The case ended with a hung jury and was settled out of court.\n\nTwo years later, Mr. Cacheris received a tremendous burst of public attention representing Hall, the 27-year-old secretary who had been implicated in the Iran-contra scandal for shredding and removing documents from the White House. Her boss was North, the key operative in the Reagan administration\u2019s illegal plan to secretly sell arms to Iran and use the profits to help right-wing Nicaraguan rebels known as the contras.\n\nHall eventually received immunity in exchange for testifying before the Iran-contra committee on Capitol Hill and at North\u2019s trial. In 1989, North was convicted of destroying government documents and other felonies but later won a reversal on the grounds of having been given immunity for his congressional testimony.\n\nReflecting on his roster of clients, Mr. Cacheris said he defended the person, not the crime. \u201cI try to see that their rights are protected,\u201d he told the South China Morning Post in 2014. \u201cI don\u2019t lecture them on what they\u2019ve done; I don\u2019t believe in that. What\u2019s done is done; now the question is \u2018how can we come out of it the best way possible?\u2019 \u201d\n\nPlato Chris Cacheris was born in Pittsburgh on May 22, 1929, and spent his teenage years in the Washington area, where his father helped run a chain of hamburger and waffle shops.\n\nHe graduated in 1947 from the old Western High School in the District and in 1951 from Georgetown University. During the Korean War, he enlisted in the Marine Corps officer candidate school program and served as defense counsel in special courts-martial cases. On the G.I. Bill, he graduated from Georgetown\u2019s law school in 1956 and was particularly inspired by a course taught by Edward Bennett Williams.\n\nIn 1955, he married Ethel Dominick. In addition to his wife, of Alexandria, survivors include two children, Lisa Burnett of Arlington, Va., and Byron Cacheris of Alexandria; a brother, James Cacheris, who became a federal judge; and a granddaughter.\n\nMr. Cacheris formed a private criminal defense practice in 1965 after several years working as a Justice Department prosecutor and an assistant U.S. attorney in Alexandria. \u201cI like defending better, although it\u2019s harder,\u201d Mr. Cacheris told The Washington Post. \u201cI like the battle against the government. And I never really liked seeing people go to jail.\u201d\n\nCourts assigned him to represent two of his most notorious clients, Ames and Hanssen.\n\nAmes, the most notorious turncoat in CIA history, was arrested in 1994. He had been spying for the Russians since 1985 and had given up the names of at least 10 agents who were supplying information to the United States.\n\nAmes agreed to plead guilty to espionage charges and to fully reveal his activities in exchange for a lenient sentence for his wife, Rosario, who knew about his betrayal and enjoyed the money he had received from the Russians. She served five years.\n\nAmes did not face the death penalty. But because the government believed his treason led to the deaths of at least 10 Russians recalled to Moscow, the espionage law was changed to allow for execution when the government could show that an offender caused the deaths of agents working for the United States.\n\nThat was the situation faced by Hanssen, who was arrested in 2001 after having spied for Moscow on and off for 22 years, and who came to be regarded as one of the most damaging double agents in U.S. history. Mr. Cacheris argued that Hanssen had betrayed some of the same agents as had Ames, and that therefore the government could not prove their deaths were caused directly by Hanssen.\n\nBoth Ames and Hanssen \u2014 who also agreed in a plea deal to disclose his espionage work \u2014 were sentenced to life in prison.\n\nIn 2013, Mr. Cacheris secretly represented Edward J. Snowden in confidential negotiations with the Justice Department after the former National Security Agency contractor was charged with espionage and granted asylum in Russia. Snowden had provided information to The Post and other newspapers about top-secret surveillance programs operated by the NSA.\n\nIn the discussions, which came to naught, Mr. Cacheris tried to forge a bargain in which Snowden could return to the United States facing reduced charges in exchange for telling officials exactly what secrets he had disclosed and how he had done so.\n\nOf all the cases Mr. Cacheris handled, perhaps the one that most exemplified the challenges of his trade was Watergate, the prototype of the sprawling legal and political scandals of modern-day Washington.\n\nMr. Cacheris and his first legal partner, William G. Hundley, represented the former attorney general who had been chairman of President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s reelection committee. Mitchell was convicted of conspiracy, obstruction of justice and perjury for his role in the Watergate affair and served 19 months in federal prison before being released for medical reasons.\n\nMr. Cacheris later opined that Mitchell would have done better if he hadn\u2019t refused to testify against Nixon, who resigned in August 1974.\n\nThe tightknit circle of established white-collar defense lawyers would often gather at the Cacheris household on Bishop Lane in Alexandria, many of them playing tennis on what was sometimes called the John Mitchell Tennis Court. Mr. Cacheris had jocularly asserted that it was paid for with the fees he got from representing Mitchell.", "description": "He represented former attorney general John Mitchell in the Watergate scandal, White House intern Monica Lewinsky, and the spies Aldrich Ames and Robert Hanssen.", "authors": ["Neil A.
