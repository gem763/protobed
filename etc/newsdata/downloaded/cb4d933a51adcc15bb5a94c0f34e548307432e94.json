It\u2019s as if they suddenly walked on a fight and saw a big guy beating up a little guy and took sides with the little guy because, well \u2013 he\u2019s little.\n\nBut you get a different picture when you find out that the little guy picked the fight, then threatened to kill the big guy and take his land. No matter what the big guy does, the threats come year after year, with no end in sight.\n\nEventually, the big guy has no choice (\u201cein breirah\u201d); he has to protect himself from this crazy little man. That\u2019s what Israel was doing when the \u201cTlaibs\u201d of the world walked in and saw the little guy getting beat up.\n\nIsrael\u2019s been protecting itself from Arab belligerency for decades. Just on Sunday, as the increasingly violent \u201cMarch of Return\u201d protests simmered at Israel\u2019s border with Gaza, Hezbollah attacked an IDF base from Lebanon with three advanced Russian-made anti-tank missiles. Predictably, Israel hit back hard with 100 artillery shells on targets in south Lebanon.\n\nBecause of the constant attacks, Arabs who want to see Israel thrown off the map have no more a right to disputed territories than Mexico does to Arizona. They pick the fights, lose the wars, and expect tiny Israel to give up captured territories that provide a buffer of security from certain death.\n\nGiven the opening created by the Ottoman\u2019s defeat after WWI, it\u2019s incredible that Arabs seemed surprised that Jews were interested in returning to their ancient homeland. After all, much of what we call Palestine today was once Judea, a kingdom named for Jacob\u2019s fourth son, Judah. Judah is where the term \u201cJews\u201d originated.\n\nRoughly 2,000 years before the Jews returned to Palestine to form a nation, the emperor Hadrian changed the name of the area that included Rome\u2019s Judea province, to \u201cSyria-Palaestina.\u201d It\u2019s believed that Hadrian used the name (derived partly from Philistia, Israel\u2019s ancient enemies) as part of a campaign to erase Jewish connection to the land after he crushed the Bar Kokhba Revolt in 135 A.D.\n\nIt worked. At least for two millennia.\n\nAfter dispersing throughout the world for centuries, Jews miraculously re-established a nation on May 14, 1948 when the British Mandate ended amid violent disputes between Jews and Arabs. U.N. Resolution 181 called for \u201cMandatory Palestine\u201d to be partitioned into two independent states \u2013 one Arab and one Jewish.\n\nJews celebrated. Arabs went to war.\n\n\u201cIf the Jewish state becomes a fact, and this is realized by the Arab peoples, they will drive the Jews who live in their midst into the sea,\u201d Muslim Brotherhood founder Hassan al-Banna told The New York Times in August 1948. \u201cEven if we are beaten now in Palestine, we will never submit. We will never accept the Jewish state.\u201d\n\nAnd they never have.\n\nWhich gets to the root of why conflict is so intractable: Palestinians have an ingrained hatred for the Jewish state. If it were just about independence, they could\u2019ve formed a state in \u201948 and worked the kinks out over time.\n\nAlthough Israel hasn\u2019t been driven into the sea, it hasn\u2019t been for a lack of trying. Arabs fought Israel in the War of Independence in 1949; the Suez Crisis in 1956; and the Six-Day War in 1967.\n\nGolda Meir, who once snuck into Jordan disguised as an Arab woman to keep Jordan out of the \u201848 war, was rigid in her belief that Israel must be defended at all costs.\n\n\u201cWe can forgive the Arabs for killing our children,\u201d Meir said as prime minister in 1969. \u201cWe cannot forgive them for forcing us to kill their children. We will only have peace with the Arabs when they love their children more than they hate us.\u201d\n\nBut the hate continued with the Yom Kippur War in 1973; the two Lebanon wars in 1982; terrorism; and the two intifadas. In the conflict between the wars, Palestinian militants fired thousands of Qassam rockets from Gaza into Israel where, in Sderot, 70 percent of Israeli children suffer from PTSD because of the attacks.\n\nA senior Hamas leader, in May, threatened a third intifada that would \u201ccleanse Palestine of the filth of the Jews\u201d by 2022, and transform Israel into an Islamic Caliphate.\n\nWith this history, two U.S. congresswomen tossed a match on this powder keg by openly supporting the BDS Movement, a group that keeps a sword at Israel\u2019s throat. Tlaib even used her grandma to over-simplify the context of a very messy, complex history. Worse, she wrapped the Palestinian cause in the American flag and used the \u201860s civil rights struggle to make it sound as if Israel\u2019s resolve to defend itself just popped out of nowhere.\n\nBut think about it: What would America do if it were in Israel\u2019s shoes? There are loose parallels between 1948 in Israel and 1848 in America.\n\nWhat if hardline Mexican militants, claiming rights to Texas and other states, fired thousands of rockets into Texas or California? What if world leaders took a neutral position in giving land back to Mexico that was ceded to the U.S. after the Mexican War in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848?\n\nThink those claims are far-fetched?\n\nIn 2017, a prominent Mexican politician, Cuauht\u00e9moc C\u00e1rdenas, called for a lawsuit before the International Court of Justice to nullify the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. That treaty sealed Texas\u2019 entry into the United States and gave us Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, California and parts of Colorado, Oklahoma, Kansas and Wyoming. C\u00e1rdenas also claimed that because parts of New Mexico and Arizona were incorrectly marked, they really belong to Mexico.\n\nMexican historian and New York Times contributor Enrique Krauze agreed, saying that President Trump\u2019s \u201cfake history\u201d in wanting to send \u201cbad hombres\u201d back over the border needed to be confronted. In a column headlined, \u201cWill Mexico Get Half Its Territory Back,\u201d Krauze believed C\u00e1rdenas had a solid legal case.\n\nAgain, if you can imagine Mexican militants shooting off rockets and justifying violence to force the return of \u201coccupied\u201d lands, you can get a taste of what Israel\u2019s been going through for seven decades.\n\nUnless Arabs acknowledge Israel\u2019s right to exist, there will be no real peace. Until then, the U.S accomplishes nothing by being neutral in a conflict where Palestinians have failed to uphold their most basic obligations to peace, simply because they\u2019re the little guy in the fight.", "description": "So much of the picture being painted about Israel\u2019s \u201coccupation\u201d .09/03/2019 19:43:03PM EST.", "authors": ["Will Alexander", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/305/cf0a9788-7984-414c-8928-d1dc78b9af16.jpg"}
