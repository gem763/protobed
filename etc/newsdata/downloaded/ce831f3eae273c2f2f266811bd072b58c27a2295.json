Arcus Foundation tax forms describe this as a \u201cmulti-pronged\u201d effort to combat \u201cthe growing trend of institutions and individuals claiming exemptions from anti-discrimination laws because of religious objections.\u201d\n\nThe Arcus Foundation is a major funder of LGBT advocacy, including \u201cgay marriage\u201d advocacy. The foundation had almost $170 million in assets in 2013 and gave out $17 million to organizations it considers to be working for social justice.\n\nAs part of this effort, the foundation joined with the titanic wealth of the Ford Foundation to back Columbia Law School\u2019s \u201cPublic Rights / Private Conscience Project,\u201d run by the Center for Gender and Sexuality Law. The Arcus Foundation gave $250,000 to Columbia University\u2019s Board of Trustees to support the project, which the foundation says will \u201cmobilize scholars, attorneys and advocates in order to develop and distribute new methods of framing perceived conflicts between sexual rights and religious liberty.\u201d\n\nColumbia University announced the project in a March 24, 2014 statement that acknowledged funding from both foundations. The announcement mentioned as examples of religious exemptions the Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood Supreme Court cases objecting to including HHS-mandated abortifacient contraceptives in employee health plans. The announcement also cited efforts to accommodate religious objections to \u201cgay marriage.\u201d\n\nThe project criticized the Supreme Court's June 2014 decision in favor of Hobby Lobby. The project also spearheaded a letter from over 50 legal scholars that called on President Barack Obama to deny a religious exemption clause in a controversial executive order prohibiting federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nThe Ford Foundation's 2013 tax forms and website indicate it has committed $650,000 to the same project, which the foundation says will \u201ccounteract religious exemption and conscience-based carve-outs to laws securing sexual and reproductive rights.\u201d The grant money also supports \u201ca symposia series on LGBT rights.\u201d\n\nThe Ford Foundation has assets of $11 billion and dispenses $500 million in grants each year. The foundation's president, Darren Walker, sits on the Arcus Foundation\u2019s eight-member board of directors. Walker is a past vice president of foundation initiatives of the Rockefeller Foundation, another titan of non-profit foundations involved in social change.\n\nLomperis noted many current controversies involving religious liberty: campus ministries have been \u201ckicked off of campus\u201d because of their Christian commitments; Christians in wedding-related industries have been threatened with fines and jail time for declining business that would involve taking part in \u201cgay weddings\u201d; health care professionals face pressure to perform elective abortions against their pro-life beliefs; and parents increasingly face difficulties exempting their children from school programs \u201cintentionally designed to cure children of traditional Christian values around sexual morality.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems that with such grants, recently and historically, essentially secular liberal funders like those at the Arcus and Ford Foundations are trying their best to undercut the pro-life and pro-traditional marriage movements,\u201d Lomperis added.\n\nThe Ford Foundation gave at least one other grant targeting religious liberty. Its 2013 grant of $150,000 to Political Research Associates supported \u201cpublic education and strategic communications on religious liberties exemptions from nondiscrimination laws,\u201d in addition to what the foundation characterized as education on the \u201cexport of homophobia abroad\u201d as portrayed in the Ford Foundation-backed film \u201cGod Loves Uganda.\u201d\n\nFunding for efforts to reframe religious liberty extend even further.\n\nIn 2014 the Arcus Foundation granted $400,000 to the Center for American Progress to back the center\u2019s Faith and Progressive Policy Initiative in order to \u201carticulate and disseminate a socially progressive framework of religious liberty as it relates to a range of issues\u201d while working with \u201ca diverse group of faith leaders, partners and allies.\u201d The website of the center and its affiliated political action fund\u2019s publication ThinkProgress criticize efforts to secure legal protections for those with religious objections to the HHS mandate or to the recognition of same-sex relationships.\n\nLomperis was skeptical of such efforts.\n\n\u201cWith the specific battles these foundations are choosing to pick, it seems clear that they are hoping to confuse the public with a few prominently touted and ridiculously unrepresentative spokespeople claiming that not even \u2018the religious community\u2019 or \u2018Christian leaders\u2019 want these necessary religious-liberty protections being debated,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Arcus Foundation has also supported pro-abortion rights groups opposed to religious freedom exemptions. Tax forms indicate it gave $500,000 to the Planned Parenthood Federation of America to \u201cexpand monitoring and analysis of organized opposition to rights, information and services related to sexual orientation, gender identity and reproductive health, as well as working to prevent expanded use of religious exemptions in policy.\u201d\n\nPlanned Parenthood is the largest abortion provider in the U.S. and was responsible for over 325,000 abortions in Fiscal Year 2014.\n\nThe Arcus Foundation was created in Kalamazoo, Michigan by Jon Stryker, an heir to the fortune of the Stryker Corporation. The foundation has offices in New York City and Cambridge, England.\n\nStryker\u2019s foundation has committed strategic funding to combating what it sees as \u201cthe abuse of religion to deny protection to LGBT people.\u201d The foundation\u2019s website says it aims to counter \u201cthe abuse of religious freedoms through \u2018religious exemptions,\u2019 and develop religious and legal strategies to hold exemptions in check.\u201d\n\nThe foundation aims to \u201cchallenge religious opponents of LGBT people in the U.S. and internationally\u201d and to develop communications strategies to counter \u201csome religious institutions\u201d which it says engage in \u201cthe discrimination and dehumanization of LGBT people.\u201d Its grant priorities aim to use \u201cmultiple change levers\u201d like \u201cleadership development, alliance-building, policy change, culture change, and resource development.\u201d\n\nThe Arcus Foundation\u2019s 2013 grant of $50,000 to the Interfaith Alliance was intended to build \u201ca faith network opposing discriminatory religious freedom exemptions,\u201d which the foundation claims to be \u201charmful.\u201d In 2014, the foundation gave $75,000 to Faithful America, a petition and activism website, to support \u201cpublic campaigns that activate Christian grassroots advocacy networks to present a faith-based challenge to religious institutions and leaders that abuse religious freedom.\u201d\n\nThe National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health received a $100,000 grant in 2013 to build its own capacities and to build a \u201ccross-movement alliance\u201d in order to \u201ccombat policies with religious exemptions.\u201d Another $100,000 went to the northwestern U.S.-based Pride Foundation in 2014 to \u201ccoordinate messaging\u201d on religious exemptions.\n\nA 2014 grant of $100,000 to the Gill Foundation backed the Movement Advancement Project\u2019s \u201cresearch and messaging on religious exemptions.\u201d The project is a strategy group that has previously helped the two foundations collaborate to advance LGBT advocacy within U.S. religious denominations, seminaries, clergy coalitions and media to counter religious opposition.\n\nThe Colorado-based Gill Foundation was founded by the politically savvy former businessman Tim Gill, a collaborator with Arcus Foundation president Jon Stryker\u2019s sister Pat Stryker. Gill has pursued a long-term political strategy of advancing LGBT causes by targeting small local and statewide political races to train the talent pool of his opponents.\n\nThe Arcus Foundation\u2019s current executive director, Kevin Jennings, is a former assistant deputy of the U.S. Department of Education, where he headed the Office of Safe and Drug Free Schools. Jennings is the founder of the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN), which has advanced LGBT activism in thousands of U.S. secondary schools. Jennings reportedly was a member of the homosexual anti-AIDS group ACT UP in the mid-1990s, just a few years after the group\u2019s notorious anti-Catholic protests in New York City.\n\nJennings is on the 25-member Board of Trustees of Union Theological Seminary, a historically prominent mainline Protestant seminary with links to Columbia University.\n\nThe Arcus Foundation has backed the Equally Blessed Coalition, an organization of Catholic dissenting groups which have attacked the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Knights of Columbus for supporting legal marriage as a union of one man and one woman. Through the group Dignity USA, the coalition also received an Arcus grant of $200,000 in 2014 \u201cto support pro-LGBT faith advocates to influence and counter the narrative of the Catholic Church and its ultra-conservative affiliates\u201d as well as to \u201cbuild advocacy and visibility in connection with two special events, the Synod of the Family and World Youth Day.\u201d\n\nThe Arcus Foundation is also a partner of the U.S. State Department\u2019s Global Equality Fund, having pledged $1 million to support U.S. government-backed LGBT activism worldwide.", "description": "", "authors": ["New York City", "N.Y.", "Feb", "Am"], "top_image": "http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/images/Paper_money_Credit__Kevin_Dooley_via_Flickr_CC_BY_20_CNA_2_11_15.jpg", "published_at": "2015-02-13"}
