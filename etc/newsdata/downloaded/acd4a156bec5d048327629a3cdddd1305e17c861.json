On some occasions, we earn revenue if you click the links and book, but we never allow this to affect our coverage.\n\nNorth West Province, South Africa\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIt may seem a far-flung choice for winter sun, but South Africa\u2019s convenient time difference (GMT+2) and sensational wildlife make it well worth the journey. Fly into Johannesburg and within four hours you can be spotting elephants and lions in Madikwe Game Reserve, one of the lesser known (and malaria free) parks up near the Botswana border.\n\nIt\u2019s home to the highly endangered African Wild dog and hippo as well as the Big Five. With the Duke and Duchess of Sussex bringing baby Archie to South Africa for their autumn tour, it\u2019s proof this is a holiday hotspot the whole family can enjoy. If you know some kids who\u2019d go wild for a Lion King-themed Christmas, Wayfairer Travel has introduced an 11-day South Africa Family Safari & Beach Holiday specifically for families with infants and toddlers, which follows luxe camp Lelapa Lodge with a few days in Mauritius, for you to get your beach fix (from \u00a314,900 per family, based on two adults and two children sharing).\n\nAverage temperature in December: 20C\n\nFlight time: 11h to Johannesburg\n\nGhent, Belgium\n\nFollow the smell of mulled wine and the twinkle of fairy lights to this unsung Flanders city\u2019s Christmas market (6 December to 5 January). While Bruges is Belgium\u2019s de facto romantic mini-break option and Antwerp owns the fashion scene, somehow Ghent\u2019s pretty canals and medieval streets slip under the radar. Its museums are packed with Flemish masterpieces \u2013 don\u2019t miss Van Eyck\u2019s Ghent Altarpiece, the most stolen artwork in history \u2013 while St Peter\u2019s Abbey dates back to the seventh-century.\n\nBut thanks to students making up a quarter of the city\u2019s population, this is a young-at-heart, lively hub where quirkily cool beer houses, cafes and concept shops sit alongside historic monuments. Slap bang in the middle of its pedestrianised centre is Pillows Grand Hotel Reylof (luxury rooms from \u20ac165), which has done a masterful job of renovating a 1724 manor house, slipping a dreamy spa and swimming pool into the original carriage house. Keep out the cold with a slab of gingerbread or yule log as you browse the festive stalls outside Saint Bavo\u2019s Cathedral; Christmas shopping just got a whole lot more appealing.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It\u2019s long been a favourite with German holidaymakers, but now the secret is getting out among Brits. Long, wide cruising trails, high-altitude powder-rich bowls, a large terrain park for snowboarders \u2013 this Tyrolean gem has all bases covered.\n\nThe apr\u00e8s-ski scene is epic, too: everyone from Rihanna to Elton has taken to the stage at its Top of the Mountain festival, which opens and closes the ski season, in the past. The coolest crash pad in town? Award-winning design hotel Hotel Madlein, with its fire pit and log cabin-encased sauna.\n\nAverage temperature in December: 4C\n\nFlight time: 1h 45m to Zurich\n\nJamaica\n\nWho needs eggnog and turkey when you have rum punch and jerk chicken? On the Caribbean\u2019s third-largest island, a scintillating dance hall scene meets incredible white-sand coves and outdoorsy adventures like scrambling up the dramatically cascading Dunns River Falls or bamboo rafting along the Martha Brae. And as next year would have been Bob Marley\u2019s 75th birthday, there\u2019s no better time to delve into the home of reggae; start off with a tour of the music legend\u2019s Kingston hangouts.\n\nAnother famous name associated with Jamaica is of course Ian Fleming, who wrote many of the James Bond novels at his Oracabessa retreat GoldenEye (now a plush hotel, with rooms from \u00a3304). Nearby Jamaica Inn (from \u00a3280 per night) has a similarly starry past \u2013 Marilyn Monroe honeymooned there and Winston Churchill was such a fan they named a suite after him. December to April brings the driest, most beach-friendly weather to Jamaica\u2019s shores after the summer hurricane season, so plonk yourself in a hammock and soak up the blissed-out vibes.\n\nAverage temperature in December: 32C\n\nFlight time: 10h\n\nNew York City, USA\n\nFrom Miracle on 34th Street to Home Alone 2, Manhattan filled our childhood minds with visions of festive cheer, and it doesn\u2019t fall short in real life. What\u2019s on the to-do list? Ice-skating in Central Park, of course, then strolling down Fifth Avenue to gawp at the department store window displays and the Rockefeller Center tree. As for catching a show, in lieu of a panto, the Christmas Spectacular Starring the Radio City Rockettes is a seasonal favourite. Don\u2019t overlook the borough across the water, either: Brooklyn\u2019s Dyker Heights is renowned for its next-level house decorations. Seek sustenance on chilly nights at the cosy yet chic Spotted Pig in the West Village, which does comforting old-school eats (including superlative burgers), while boutique hotel newcomer Arlo SoHo (rooms from \u00a3143 per night) offers sheepskin and walnut-bedecked compact crash pads in downtown\u2019s old printing district.\n\nAverage temperature in December: 4C\n\nFlight time: 8h", "description": "From gluhwein-fuelled Christmas market city breaks to a different kind of winter warmth down south,\u00a0here\u2019s where to escape to this festive season.
