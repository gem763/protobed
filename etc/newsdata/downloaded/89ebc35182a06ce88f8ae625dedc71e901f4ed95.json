Such lies about him.\"\n\n\"They want to scare him into turning Liberal,\" Trump added.\n\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is also a 2020 presidential contender, tweeted Sunday afternoon that Kavanaugh's \"nomination was rammed through the Senate without a thorough examination of the allegations against him.\"\n\n\"Confirmation is not exoneration, and these newest revelations are disturbing. Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached,\" she continued, referring to Trump.\n\nCalifornia Sen. Kamala Harris wrote on Twitter Sunday morning recalling her time on the Senate Judiciary Committee through Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings, which she slammed as a \"sham process\" where \"Kavanaugh lied to the US Senate and...to the American people.\"\n\nKavanaugh was confirmed to the Supreme Court last October after a tumultuous battle over the multiple allegations of sexual misconduct he faced.\n\nThe Times reported that Max Stier, a former Yale student said he saw Kavanaugh at a drunken dorm party where his friends pushed his penis into a female student's hands. Kavanaugh was reportedly a freshman at the time of the incident.\n\nStier's account bears similarities to an allegation made by Deborah Ramirez, another Yale classmate who accused Kavanaugh of pulling his pants down and thrusting his penis in her face at a different dorm party.\n\nRead more: Trump said Brett Kavanaugh 'should start suing people' over new sexual harassment allegation\n\nThis latest allegation was reported to the FBI during the confirmation process last year but was not investigated by the agency, according to the Times.\n\nMinnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar similarly said the FBI investigation into previous allegations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh was a \"sham\" and said the attorney general should release the documents so House lawmakers could examine them.\n\n\"I think the whole thing was a sham and that those documents need to be turned over as well as the documents that the White House hid from his time in the White House counsel's office,\" she told host George Stephanopoulos on \"ABC News This Week.\"\n\n\"All of that needs to come forward to even look at a proceeding like that.\"\n\nThe senator said she has made her views on Kavanaugh \"very clear\" and believed since his nomination that his track record and reputation would \"continue to haunt our country.\"\n\n\"I strongly opposed him based on his views on executive power, which will continue to haunt our country, as well as how he behaved, including the allegations that we are hearing more about today,\" she said.\n\nFormer housing secretary and Democratic 2020 hopeful Juli\u00e1n Castro had previously called for Kavanaugh to be impeached over the incident and tweeted shortly after the Times released the report to demand the latest account be investigated.\n\nCastro later added that \"It's more clear than ever that Brett Kavanaugh lied under oath\" and \"Congress should review the failure of the Department of Justice to properly investigate the matter.\" On the subject of further investigation, Castro responded to Trump's demand for the Justice Department\n\nOnly one Supreme Court justice has been impeached: Justice Samuel Chase went through the process in 1805 before he was ultimately acquitted by the Senate.\n\nDemocrats have reportedly been weighing the best path for contesting Kavanaugh's place on the court since his confirmation with legal fights beginning in October 2018 to reveal potentially damaging records that didn't go public during his nomination. Despite the widespread sentiment in the party, that process was expected to take years.", "description": "Democrats have been weighing the best path for contesting Kavanaugh's place on the court since his October 2018 confirmation.", "authors": ["Ellen Cranley"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7e556b2e22af00df1c9d82-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
