'Why is this TV on CNN?' You're never going to appeal to everyone,\" Ward says.\n\nAAFES issued similar guidance in the past, he adds, and \"it's not just the political climate we're in now.\"\n\nWard said the agency planned to send out an updated memo to clarify the recommendation.\n\nThat message includes leeway for facilities to make adjustments \"based on the news of the day and local needs,\" he says.\n\nRic Chavez, an Army veteran who retired in 2018, tells NPR that he frequently saw both CNN and Fox on televisions at barber shops in Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait and throughout the United States.\n\nChavez, 40, describes being conflicted on AAFES' guidance. He says that news programming in AAFES facilities \"should be blocked because regardless of your political affiliation, you still have to have an allegiance to your president.\" But he is also concerned about denying people information. \"It shouldn't be blocked because it could be viewed as a form of censorship,\" Chavez says.\n\nAAFES also has prohibited his friend from making craft items with political affiliations that would be sold at a military base in California, he added.\n\nOver a meal at U.S. Army Garrison Yongsan in South Korea, Pfc. Tyler White told Stars and Stripes, \"I just think politics should stay out of the work environment.\"\n\nAnother soldier, Staff Sgt. Manuel Cardona, told the military newspaper that he disagreed with AAFES decision. The broadcasts were \"informative,\" and often his only way of catching up on the day's news.", "description": "The Army and Air Force Exchange Service initially recommended that facilities feature sports programming.
