Ted Cruz: Democrats still 'angry at the voters' who elected Trump", "language": "en", "text": "Sen. Ted Cruz said Friday that the Democrats\u2019 push to impeach President Trump is driven by their lingering resentment from the 2016 election and their \u201canger\u201d toward the Americans who elected him.\n\n\u201cWashington is always a circus, but this is three rings with all the clowns and it\u2019s nuts right now,\u201d Mr. Cruz, Texas Republican, told Fox News.\n\n\u201cCongressional Democrats are angry,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re angry about the 2016 election and, ultimately, they\u2019re angry at the voters. They\u2019re angry that the voters elected President Trump. From day one, they have been wanting to get this president out of office. As a result, they\u2019re not doing their job. They\u2019re not actually interested in legislating. They\u2019re not actually interested in working together to produce more jobs and raise wages and expand opportunity. It\u2019s just about attacking the president.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Tuesday an impeachment inquiry into the president over allegations that he pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a phone call to investigate Joseph R. Biden and his son Hunter while also withholding millions of dollars in aid. Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky have denied any quid pro quo agreement and the Ukrainian president said he did not feel pressured by the U.S. president. Mr. Trump has characterized the latest controversy as a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nMr. Cruz agreed that the impeachment push is \u201cnot driven by facts\u201d and that the Democrats will move onto the next controversy as soon as this one blows over.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
