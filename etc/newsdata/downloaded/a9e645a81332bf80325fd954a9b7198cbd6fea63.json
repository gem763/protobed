Parnas and Fruman were both part of Giuliani's efforts in the matter.\n\nThe former New York mayor is also under criminal investigation \u2014 separate from the counterintelligence probe \u2014 for his role in the abrupt ouster of Marie Yovanovitch, the US's former ambassador to Ukraine, and whether he broke foreign lobbying laws in the process.\n\nSpecifically, prosecutors are said to be examining whether Giuliani was working on behalf of the Ukrainian prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, while pushing for Yovanovitch's dismissal.\n\nThe Southern District of New York \u2014 nicknamed the \"Sovereign District of New York\" \u2014 has a longstanding reputation for operating largely independent from the Justice Department's headquarters in Washington, DC. CNN's report said the office's investigation into Giuliani and his associates goes much farther back than what has previously been reported.\n\nThe investigation is said to be looking in part at who financed Giuliani's work in Ukraine, which included collaborating with Parnas and Fruman and lobbying the Ukrainian government on behalf of Kharkiv, a small town located in eastern Ukraine.\n\nRead more: Rudy Giuliani urged Trump to turn over an exiled Muslim cleric to Erdogan, raising concerns that he was lobbying for Turkey\n\nAsha Rangappa, a former FBI special agent, wrote on Twitter that the existence of a counterintelligence investigation into Giuliani indicates that the FBI believes \"he may pose a national security threat to the United States.\"\n\nSuch investigations aren't rooted in suspicions that someone violated US laws, but rather in concerns that the individual was in contact with people linked to foreign intelligence, or that they're working to further the interests of a foreign power in the US, Rangappa added.\n\nThe bar for opening this type of investigation into Giuliani, who is a US national and the president's personal lawyer, is also higher than it is for probing foreign individuals.\n\n\"So basically, the FBI thinks something bad \u2014 and likely not 'unwitting' \u2014 is up,\" Rangappa wrote. \"That Giuliani is a conduit for pushing the agendas of foreign intelligence and/or foreign interests.\"\n\nAlthough criminal investigations and counterintelligence investigations typically run on two separate tracks, Rangappa noted that it's possible a counterintelligence probe can include criminal violations. It's unclear what those would be in Giuliani's case, but previous reporting suggests the former New York mayor could be accused of violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), which governs foreign lobbying in the US.\n\nRead more: The floodgates are opening as Trump officials publicly defy his orders and more whistleblowers come out of the shadows\n\nIn addition to his work in Ukraine, Giuliani also raised red flags among White House aides by repeatedly pushing Trump to extradite Fethullah Gulen, a controversial Muslim cleric, to the Turkish government, the Washington Post reported this week.\n\nGulen lives in exile in Pennsylvania and has been accused by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of orchestrating a failed 2016 coup against him and of generally fomenting dissent within Turkey. Gulen denies any involvement in the attempted coup.\n\nGetting the US to extradite Gulen has long been a top priority for Erdogan, and Giuliani's reported efforts to facilitate that goal raises further questions about the extent to which he tried to influence government policy while acting as a private citizen.\n\nThe Post reported that Giuliani mentioned Gulen so often that one former official described the topic as the former New York mayor's \"hobby horse.\"\n\n\"It was all Gulen,\" a second former official told the Post. Giuliani was so intent on the matter that some White House aides reportedly worried he was working on behalf of the Turkish government.", "description": "\"Cases like these, and they aren't common, usually involve multiple schemes and numerous players,\" one DOJ veteran told Insider.", "authors": ["Sonam Sheth"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5c966ce509b60334d5039964?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
