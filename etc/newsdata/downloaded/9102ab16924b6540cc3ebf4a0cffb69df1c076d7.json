REUTERS/Issei Kato\n\nEuropean and U.S. stocks market looked set to follow, with Eurostoxx 50 futures slipping 0.7%, while futures for Germany\u2019s DAX were down 0.9% and those for France\u2019s CAC 40 eased 0.5%.\n\nBy contrast, London\u2019s FTSE futures climbed 0.3%.\n\nWall Street was signaling a weak start, too, with E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 off 0.4%.\n\nBrent crude futures surged nearly 20% at one point early in the day and U.S. futures jumped almost 16%, both hitting their highest level since May. But prices came off their peaks after U.S. President Donald Trump authorized the use of the country\u2019s emergency stockpile to ensure stable supply.\n\nBy 0640 GMT, Brent futures were up 10% at $66.31 per barrel, while U.S. light crude was up 9% at $59.82.\n\nTrump also said the United States was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d for a potential response to the strikes on the Saudi facilities, which shut 5% of world production, after a senior official in his administration said Iran was to blame.\n\nThat inflamed fears about Middle East tensions and worsening relations between Iran and the United States, powering safe-haven assets, with gold up 1% to $1,503.4 per ounce.\n\n\u201cThe bigger issue is what premium markets will build in to reflect the risk of further attacks,\u201d said Kerry Craig, Global Market Strategist, J.P. Morgan Asset Management.\n\n\u201cIn the very near-term, we may also see a pick-up in safe-havens,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cCentral banks are likely to look through the inflationary impact of higher oil prices but the added geopolitical risk to an already fragile backdrop will not go without notice.\u201d\n\nMSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.4% after data showed China\u2019s industrial production growth unexpectedly fell to its weakest pace in 17-1/2 years in August.\n\nPainting a dour picture of the world\u2019s second-biggest economy, China\u2019s statistics bureau said the country faces increasing downward pressure from external uncertainties.\n\nChina\u2019s blue-chip index eased 0.5%, while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index faltered about 1%, despite expectations Beijing will soon announce more support measures.\n\nLiquidity was relatively thin with Japanese markets shut for a public holiday.\n\nBONDS AND CURRENCIES\n\nIn currency markets, the Saudi news pushed the yen up 0.2% to 107.83 per dollar while boosting oil-exporter currencies such as the Canadian dollar, which rose 0.4%.\n\n\u201cIf risk appetite collapses due to fears of worsening Middle East tensions in the wake of any retaliation to the...attacks, some emerging markets could face a double whammy of pressures,\u201d said Mitul Kotecha, Singapore-based senior emerging markets strategist at TD Securities.\n\nHe noted that the Indian rupee, Indonesian rupiah and Philippine peso were the Asian currencies most sensitive to oil shocks, given their economies\u2019 dependence on crude imports.\n\nThe euro was little moved near a three-week top while the pound stepped back from Friday\u2019s two-month highs to be last at $1.247. That left the greenback down 0.1% at 98.126 against a basket of six major currencies.\n\nThe Australian dollar, a major risk proxy, fell 0.3% against the yen, snapping nine straight days of gains. The kiwi dollar slipped to a one-week low on the yen.\n\n\u201cOne immediate question this (attack) poses for bond markets is whether a further rise in the inflation expectations component of bond yields - which have proved historically sensitive to oil prices - will give this month\u2019s sharp bond market sell-off fresh impetus,\u201d said NAB analyst Ray Attrill.\n\n\u201cOr will safe-haven considerations dominate to drive yields lower?\u201d\n\nFutures for U.S. 10-year Treasury notes rose 0.3%.\n\nIn the cash market, prices for both two- and ten-year Treasuries gained, ending a five-day bond sell-off and sending yields lower from near 1-1/2 month highs.\n\nInvestors are also awaiting the outcome of the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s policy meeting on Wednesday, at which it is widely expected to ease interest rates and signal its future policy path.\n\n\u201cThe markets will look to the Fed as a key pillar of support and that will increasingly be in focus for global markets as the week goes on,\u201d JPMorgan\u2019s Craig added.", "description": "Oil surged to four-month highs on Monday after weekend attacks on crude facilities in Saudi Arabia sparked supply fears, while shares in Asia extended losses as bleak economic data from China sapped investors' appetite for riskier assets.", "authors": ["Swati Pandey", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190915&t=2&i=1430256600&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8E0SG", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
