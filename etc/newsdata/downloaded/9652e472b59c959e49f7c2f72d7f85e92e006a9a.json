It\u2019s grotesque.\n\n'Businesses like supermarkets and cafes must switch to a reuse and refill model.\n\n'That means metal cutlery, proper cups, water refill stations, and selling products in refillable packaging or none at all. It\u2019s common sense.'\n\nThe three main culprits in the plastic-swap, which has been encouraged by customers becoming concerned about pollution in the oceans, are bioplastics, compostable plastics and paper, Greenpeace said.\n\nCompostable plastic and paper bags have been brought in at supermarkets including Aldi, the Co-op, Morrison's, Sainsbury's and Waitrose.\n\nBut an investigation earlier this year found that compostable plastics often end up in general rubbish in landfill or an incinerator.\n\nThis was because not enough places had the right facilities to be able to compost the rubbish, the investigation by environmental campaigner, Footprint, found.\n\nMeanwhile, fast food and takeaway shops including McDonald's and Pret A Manger have made switches intended to be better for the environment.\n\nPret A Manger is introducing compostable plastic cutlery to all its stores this year, but Greenpeace said companies should be focused on genuinely reusable options like metal cutlery\n\nMcDonald's has swapped from plastic drinks straws to paper ones, but these can't be recycled, Greenpeace said.\n\nAnd Pret's plans to introduce compostable plastic to all its outlets this year goes against what would be best for the environment.\n\nParliament's Environmental and Rural Affairs Committee has recently recommended switching away from single-use packaging of any kind.\n\nIts chairman, Neil Parish MP, said: 'Fundamentally, substitution is not the answer, and we need to look at ways to cut down on single use packaging.'", "description": "A report by the London-based environmental charity said food chains and supermarkets should fully commit to reusable options like metal cutlery and unpackaged food.", "authors": ["Sam Blanchard For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/01/15/19159224-0-image-a-7_1569941316300.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
