He didn\u2019t want his son taking pills.\n\n\u201cYou hear of losing your child\u2019s personality, and they become a shell of themselves, and they\u2019re not that sparking little kid that you love,\u201d Brett Knapp said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to lose that with Brody, \u2019cause he\u2019s an amazing kid.\u201d\n\nBrody\u2019s mother, Ashley, had other ideas. She\u2019s a school principal with ADHD herself.\n\n\u201cI was all for stimulants at the very, very beginning just because I know what they can do to help a neurological issue such as ADHD,\u201d Ashley Knapp said.\n\nMore and more families face the same dilemma. The prevalence of ADHD has shot up in the past two decades, and now, 1 in 10 children in the U.S. are diagnosed with it.\n\nThe new guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend that children with ADHD be screened for mental illness and monitored closely, but the treatment recommendations regarding medication are essentially unchanged from previous guidelines published in 2011.\n\nAnyone over age 5 should start taking medication and get behavioral therapy as soon as they are diagnosed. Children under 5 should start with behavioral treatment before taking any medications.\n\nStill, many experts worry that the role of medication in treatment is too large.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly true that when you watch TV, you\u2019re not going to see a lot of commercials about behavioral treatments, but you very well may see some new ones about medication,\u201d said Dr. Carla Allan, an ADHD specialist at Children\u2019s Mercy in Kansas City and a member of the ADHD Clinical Practice Guidelines Subcommittee. Allan is Brody\u2019s doctor and had a role in drafting the latest guidelines. While she wants to see more ADHD patients receive behavioral treatment, she said, she agrees with the AAP\u2019s decision to hold steady on its recommendations about medication.\n\nOther experts say the guidelines should have done more to prioritize behavioral treatments.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a huge disservice to not just the children that we\u2019re trying to treat but also to the parent who would prefer to have behavioral interventions,\u201d said Erika Coles, a psychology researcher at Florida International University.\n\nA behavioral intervention can range from cognitive therapy to school support. It can be as simple as parents setting up a system of expectations reinforced by rewards or punishments.\n\nThese interventions are designed to teach children strategies they can use on a daily basis to help stay focused and to reinforce social skills that may fail to develop when children struggle to concentrate.\n\nAfter school, Ashley Knaap used behavioral techniques to keep son Brody on track with his chores. This is supposed to help him internalize the discipline and \u201cgrit\u201d needed to complete difficult tasks, but it can feel to her like micromanaging, she said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the idea that I have to tell my kids or anybody what to do,\u201d she said. \u201cI want them to be able to think for themselves and make those safe choices, but at this point, that\u2019s just not possible yet for Brody.\u201d\n\nBut the techniques \u2014 things like counting to keep him on the task of putting away his toys, and rewards like time playing legos after he finishes a chore \u2014 are helping him, she admitted.\n\nWhile the AAP guidelines advise a combination of meds and behavioral treatment, the research backing this combination is problematic, according to Coles, because the two approaches weren\u2019t evaluated separately.\n\n\u201cIf you look at studies that did the combined treatment of both medication and behavioral interventions, you can\u2019t disentangle what leads to the best outcome,\u201d Coles said.\n\nA study published in 2016 in the Journal of Clinical Child & Adolescent Psychology explored the sequencing of treatment methods and showed that kids with ADHD between ages 5 and 12 who were given behavioral treatment before starting pills had less behavioral problems than kids who started with pills right away.\n\nA new study co-authored by Coles took it further. It found that children ages 5-13 with ADHD who received therapy first often needed less medication. And 37% of the children who got therapy first didn\u2019t end up needing to take pills at all.\n\n\u201cReally, what it\u2019s suggesting is that if we use behavioral intervention as the first line of treatment, we can reduce or eliminate the need for medication in children with ADHD,\u201d Coles said.\n\nFewer meds also means fewer side effects. Some kids have trouble sleeping, lose their appetite or experience personality changes, and there\u2019s not much research on what it means to stay on these drugs for years, especially when one is still growing.\n\nThe studies backing therapy first are promising and compelling, but they are small. Coles\u2019 research looked at 127 children, while the 2016 study evaluated 146.\n\nA spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics ADHD Clinical Practice Guidelines Subcommittee said the group reviewed the recent behavioral-first research but didn\u2019t find the evidence strong enough to warrant a change in the guidelines.\n\nHowever, both the academy and its critics agree that not enough children are getting adequate behavioral treatment. Only about 60% of kids with ADHD in the U.S. ever got any behavioral interventions outside of school, while 90% had received medication, according to a 2018 study published in the Journal of Pediatrics.\n\nNumerous advocates point out that there are not enough trained therapists, the interventions can be time-consuming for families, and many families can\u2019t afford it.\n\nBrody\u2019s family started with behavioral treatments alone, but after four months he experienced a violent meltdown, which made the family decide to give Brody some medication too. He now takes Concerta.\n\nBrody\u2019s dad said he\u2019s OK with that and that doing the therapy first gave him insight.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily for the child,\u201d Brett Knapp said of the parental training he received. \u201cIt really is for the parent to realize what an ADHD kid looks like. And for the perspective, I think it helped out greatly to kind of realize how I need to interact and how I need to talk and how I need to work with my child.\u201d\n\nThis story is part of a partnership that includes KCUR, NPR and Kaiser Health News.\n\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.
