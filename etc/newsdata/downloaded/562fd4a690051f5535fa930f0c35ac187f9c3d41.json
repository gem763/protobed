REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\n\u201cThe transcript of his call released yesterday did not seem to have anything specific that Trump said, \u2018do this for that,\u2019\u201d Lederer said.\n\n\u201cThe whistleblower complaint looks like there was more to it, but I don\u2019t know. Overall, it\u2019s just the idea that markets don\u2019t like uncertainty,\u201d he added.\n\nMSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.06%, while the pan-European STOXX 600 index of large, mid- and small companies rose 0.61%.\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 79.59 points, or 0.3%, to 26,891.12. The S&P 500 lost 7.25 points, or 0.24%, to 2,977.62 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 46.72 points, or 0.58%, to 8,030.66.\n\nFacebook Inc slipped 1.47% as a person familiar with the matter told Reuters that the U.S. Justice Department will open an antitrust investigation of the social media company.\n\nThe dollar rose to a three-week high against a basket of currencies, helped by continued tightness in U.S. money markets, while heightened political tensions and a relatively dismal economic outlook weighed on the euro and sterling.\n\nIncreased political tensions on both sides of the Atlantic - the unfolding effort by U.S. congressional Democrats to impeach Trump and ongoing uncertainty regarding Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union - was likely to keep the greenback in demand, analysts said.\n\nThe dollar index rose 0.16%, with the euro down 0.2% to $1.0919. The Japanese yen weakened 0.06% versus the greenback at 107.86 per dollar.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nCrude oil prices pared losses late in the session after the U.S. Department of Defense said it would deploy radar systems, Patriot missiles and about 200 personnel to bolster Saudi Arabia\u2019s defenses after an attack on the kingdom\u2019s oil installations earlier this month.\n\nBrent crude futures settled up 35 cents at $62.74 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell 8 cents to settle at $56.41 a barrel.\n\nU.S. gold futures settled up 0.2% at $1,515.20.", "description": "U.S. stocks and government debt yields fell on Thursday after the release of a whistleblower complaint that accused President Donald Trump of pressing Ukraine to investigate one of his main political rivals in next year's U.S. presidential election.", "authors": ["Herbert Lash", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434182246&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P1D5", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
