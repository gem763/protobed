Whether it's a designer gown or $20 pair of jeans, sometimes even small tweaks can make a huge difference in how a garment fits, feels and looks on you.\n\nOf course, some brands and retailers do offer complimentary simple alterations, but if you're looking to do more than basic pants-hemming or sleeve-shortening, it can be helpful to know where to go for great tailoring. And, many top seamstresses and tailors can even create custom or made-to-measure items for a reasonable fee, if you can't quite find what you're looking for in stores.\n\nHere are seven Vancouver-area alteration shops and sewing experts that come highly recommended by a very discerning group: fashion industry professionals.\n\nParadise Fashion Studio, 3454 West Broadway\n\nRecommended by: Anna Cordon, publicist at Aritzia\n\nThe review: \"This Kitsilano shop is a little out of the way and a touch pricier, but they do such a great job. I've brought lots of higher-end pieces to them for alterations and everything's come back absolutely perfect. I primarily go there to have dresses tailored ... it feels like I have weddings every weekend during the summer, so they're my go-to for getting dresses to fit just right.\"\n\nThe insider tip: \"Don't expect an overnight turnaround; they aren't the fastest spot in town but they make up for it in quality of work. I wouldn't go there with a rush job but more so things that I want taken care of properly.\"\n\nSunwood Dry Cleaners, 3025 Lougheed Hwy #360, Coquitlam, BC\n\nRecommended by: Adele Tetangco, fashion entrepreneur\n\nThe review: \"I've only ever used this company as my tailor. They do everything \u2014 bridesmaids' dresses, vintage pieces, you name it. They are also well-priced and, most importantly, quick.\"\n\nThe insider tip: \"Ask for Edna. She's awesome. I once gave her a pair of my dad's old pants from the '80s and she turned them into cool trousers for me.\"\n\nVika Atelier Boutique, 11871 Horseshoe Way #1123, Richmond, BC\n\nRecommended by: Jessica Wong, writer and editor\n\nThe review: \"Vika is incredibly quick and inexpensive. She's also just a funny woman with a lot of pizzazz and character. She'll tell it to you straight, but that's also why it's easy to trust her and feel like you're getting a fair price. I inherited a cheongsam from a relative who had recently passed away, and when I needed to get it altered last-minute for a special event my mom took me to see Vika. I was nervous since the garment was precious and quite old, but Vika approached the job with confidence and ease, while also showing an admiration for and understanding of the fine workmanship that went into it. She finished the alterations within the week, it fit perfectly, and the entire thing cost under $30.\"\n\n\n\nThe insider tip: \"Be sure to call first. This is a one-woman show ... so while the work is excellent, the hours are a little fuzzy and she may not always be around the shop.\"\n\nSimdy's Fashion Alteration, 1062 Davie Street\n\nRecommended by: Amanda Rozak, director at Lizbell Agency\n\nThe review: \"I personally recommend Simdy's on Davie. I sew myself, but for alterations on more delicate fabrics like high-end dresses or suit jackets, I trust Simdy. She has really innovative ideas and is reasonable.\"\n\nThe insider tip: For smaller adjustments or quick turnarounds, Rozak has also had good experiences at Stitch International at Pacific Centre.\n\nGolden Dry Cleaners and Tailors, 1087 Hornby Street\n\nRecommended by: Jeevitha Kandasamy, model\n\nThe review: \"From altering dresses to suits, Shandel and Aziz can do anything, are very talented and handle clothing with great care. Shandel in particular is a joy to work with, she's always so positive and aims to work with my schedule.\"\n\nThe insider tip: Kandasamy, who also works as a custom menswear stylist through Tom James Canada, says that Golden Dry Cleaners handles luxurious fabrics and high-end suiting very well.\n\nA & R Alteration and Dressmaking, 30 East 11th Avenue\n\nRecommended by: Luisa Rino, fashion stylist\n\nThe review: \"Arthur and Rose Yalung and their daughter Abbey are all super-talented. Arthur, a tailor, once reworked a Dries blazer for me that was two sizes too big; it was a miracle that he made it fit. Rose is a seamstress and she's rebuilt dresses for me \u2014 like most stylists, I sometimes get the urge to re-imagine an old piece into something new. Abby is all-around skilled.\"\n\nThe insider tip: \"The shop is old-world and extremely busy, so it's up to you to manage your requests. Get a quote, ask them to write it all down for you, and if they promise the piece for a certain date, be sure to call two days ahead to ensure they are still on track to deliver. If you manage your own logistics, you won't be disappointed by turning up on the due date with nothing ready.\"\n\nNordstrom Pacific Centre, 799 Robson Street\n\nRecommended by: Wade Papin, co-designer at jewelry brand Pyrrha\n\nThe review: \"The alterations department at Nordstrom is excellent. Professional, detailed and quick. They recently tailored a suit for me that had detailing on the jacket sleeve, and without hesitation approached the alteration from the shoulder to ensure [the] integrity of the design. Their tailors really care about the clothing.\"\n\nThe insider tip: You can bring in any garment; it doesn't matter if you purchased it from Nordstrom or not, says Papin. And appointments can be booked online.\n\nTruc Nguyen is a Toronto-based writer, editor and stylist.
