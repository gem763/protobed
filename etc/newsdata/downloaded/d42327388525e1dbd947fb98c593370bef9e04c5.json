(Jorge Silva/Pool Photo via AP, File)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The White House concealed some reconstructed transcripts of delicate calls between President Donald Trump and foreign officials, including President Vladimir Putin and the Saudi royal family, in a highly classified computer system after embarrassing leaks of his conversations, according to current and former officials.\n\nThe handling of Trump\u2019s calls with world leaders has come under scrutiny after questions over whether a transcript of a July 25 call with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine was improperly placed into this computer system.\n\nThe latest revelations show the focus that White House officials put on safeguarding not only classified information but also delicate calls with Trump, the details of which the administration did not want leaked.\n\nA whistleblower complaint accuses officials of trying to \u201clock down\u201d access to information about the conversation with Zelenskiy by improperly storing the reconstructed transcript of the July 25 call in the highly classified system after the call took place.\n\nIn the case of the calls with the Saudi royal family, the restrictions were set beforehand, and the number of people allowed to listen was sharply restricted. The Saudi calls placed in the restricted system were with King Salman, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Prince Khalid bin Salman, who at the time was the Saudi ambassador to the United States.\n\nWhile the calls included delicate information about Trump\u2019s discussions about the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, there was no apparent evidence of impropriety by Trump, said a person familiar with the matter.\n\nThe access restrictions placed on the calls with Putin of Russia and the Saudi royal family were first reported Friday night by CNN.\n\nThe practice began after details of Trump\u2019s Oval Office discussion with the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, leaked to the news media, leading to questions of whether the president had released classified information, according to multiple current and former officials. The White House was particularly upset when the news media reported that Trump had called James Comey, the former FBI director, a \u201cnut job\u201d during that same meeting, according to current and former officials.\n\nThe White House had begun restricting access to information after initial leaks of Trump\u2019s calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia. But the conversation with Lavrov and Sergey Kislyak, then the Russian ambassador to the United States, prompted tighter restrictions.\n\nSeveral current and former officials played down the significance of placing the classified calls into the secure system, saying it made sense to restrict the calls given the number of leaks from the Trump White House.\n\nNevertheless, the use of the system has come under scrutiny after the unclassified version of the whistleblower complaint was made public. The complaint raised questions that the July 25 call with the Ukrainian president had been improperly placed in the classified system, suggesting that officials put the reconstructed transcript into a system meant to protect the nation\u2019s most sensitive secrets.\n\nThe Trump administration said Friday that National Security Council lawyers had made the decision to place the reconstructed transcript of that phone call into a highly classified computer system accessible to only a small number of officials.\n\n\u201cNSC lawyers directed that the classified document be handled appropriately,\u201d said a senior administration official. The statement was also first reported by CNN.\n\nBut the official did not actually say how the document was handled, nor address the whistleblower\u2019s specific charge that the reconstructed transcript, in what would be a highly unusual action, was moved from a computer system widely accessible to National Security Council officials to one reserved for those with code-word clearance to handle the country\u2019s most closely guarded secrets like covert operations and foreign surveillance.\n\nA White House spokesman did not respond when asked about that specific claim. Democrats in Congress and former NSC officials and lawyers in both parties have said such an action, if motivated by a desire to conceal Trump\u2019s efforts to put political pressure on the Ukrainian leader, would be far from appropriate, and at a minimum, unethical. But in a combative exchange with reporters later in the day, Kellyanne Conway, a White House counselor, repeated the spokesman\u2019s language, saying that \u201cas I understand, the document was handled appropriately at all times.\u201d", "description": "WASHINGTON -- The White House concealed some reconstructed transcripts of delicate calls between President Donald Trump and foreign officials, including President Vladimir Putin and the Saudi royal family, in a highly classified computer system after embarrassing leaks of his conversations, according", "authors": ["Julian E.
