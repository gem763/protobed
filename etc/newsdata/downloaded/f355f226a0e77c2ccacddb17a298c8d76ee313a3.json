He added he hadn\u2019t been outside for nine years.\n\n\u201cHe had long hair, a dirty beard, wore old clothes and looked confused,\u201d bar owner Chris Westerbeek told RTV. \u201cHe said he\u2019d never been to school and hadn\u2019t been to the barber for nine years.\u201d\n\nAfter contacting authorities, officers visited the farmhouse in search of the rest of the man\u2019s family.
