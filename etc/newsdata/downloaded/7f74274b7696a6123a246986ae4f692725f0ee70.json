(Photo: Samir Hussein/WireImage)\n\nKate Middleton\u2019s wardrobe may be embracing the fall season, but her hair still has that summer sheen.\n\nThe brunette duchess showed off warm blond highlights as she made an appearance at the Natural History Museum in London on Wednesday. The royal, who serves as a patron for the museum, wore her layered locks down for the occasion, giving royal fans a good look at her sunkissed makeover.\n\nFashion-wise, however, she stuck to autumnal tones. Kate wore an eggplant-hued knit sweater with a scalloped neckline from British high street chain Warehouse, which she paired with olive green culottes from Jigsaw, another fast fashion favorite.
