The challenge is that they rule China and control access to a potentially lucrative market.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nIn the NBA\u2019s case, this dilemma was front and center for the past week after the Houston Rockets GM Daryl Morey expressed support for demonstrators in Hong Kong, tweeting, \u201cFight for freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d The tweet was quickly taken down as the NBA, generating some $4 billion in revenue from China, struggled to limit the fallout with Beijing.\n\nThe Lakers\u2019 LeBron James, himself seen as an outspoken advocate for social justice in America, criticized Morey\u2019s tweet in support of human rights, saying it \u201ccould have waited a week.\u201d The NBA was playing a series of exhibition games in China over the past several days.\n\nWith the Chinese Communist Party and its official mouthpieces calling foul on the NBA over free speech issues, how might that lesson apply to American investors?\n\nESG Investing\n\nRoughly 30 years ago, a new form of investing guidelines began to take hold that eventually became known as ESG (for environmental, social and corporate governance).\n\nESG has changed the investment landscape by restricting capital from business activities deemed unworthy of investment. Currently, about $10 trillion of the $42 trillion in U.S. market capitalization is run in accordance with ESG guidelines.\n\nSan Francisco-based Bank of the West, for example, last year announced that it was pulling financing for companies that explore and produce oil and gas from shale, tar sands, or the Arctic \u2014 meaning most of the oil and gas now produced in America.\n\nCalifornia furnishes a glimpse of what ESG policies writ large. The state\u2019s politicians have aggressively pursued environmental policies that have greatly increased wind and solar power.\n\nAt the same time, California energy costs have soared. California\u2019s oil production is half of what it was 30 years ago while in Texas, oil production has quintupled over the last decade.\n\nEnvironmentalists and their ESG allies don\u2019t like oil and natural gas pipelines. As a result, California imports 57.5% of its oil from overseas, with the largest share coming from Saudi Arabia (no bad shale oil there).\n\nThe number of oil tankers plying California waters has more than doubled in recent years and is going up because the state doesn\u2019t produce much of its own oil anymore. That oil tankers are more prone to spills seems lost on ESG boosters.\n\nMeanwhile, California\u2019s industries have been leaving the state. Some of that manufacturing has moved to China. With China\u2019s lax air pollution standards, scientists have determined that as much as 65% of the increase in ozone levels on the Pacific Coast originated in Asia, mostly China.\n\nChina: ESG Investing\u2019s Blindspot\n\nAs ESG investing is shifting trillions of dollars in the capital markets, what have ESG analysts said about the Peoples\u2019 Republic of China? Not much.\n\nPenserra, a 10-year-old ESG institutional financial services and investment advising firm, provides an example. While promoting the usual line on responsible investing, Penserra is also bullish on China, as are many major U.S. players, such as Goldman Sachs, T. Rowe Price and others.\n\nTicker Security Last Change Change % GS GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC. 207.42 +0.96 +0.47% TROW T.

The answer is as simple as it is common sense: no.\n\nLet\u2019s take a quick look at the three pillars of ESG and how they apply to China.\n\nEnvironmental\n\nWhile the People\u2019s Republic of China has strong air and water pollution regulations, they are unevenly enforced due to pervasive corruption that allows businesses to pollute as much as they want \u2014 provided that the right amount of money greases the palms of the proper local communist official. Chinese state-owned industries, many of them with shares available on Western stock exchanges, are also largely immune from pressure to operate cleanly.\n\nFurther, while California and other political bodies in the Western world rush to ban plastic straws to save the ocean, China\u2019s vast merchant fleet is notorious for simply dumping trash into the ocean.\n\nESG advisors are also strangely silent on China\u2019s actions over the past decade in destroying fragile coral atolls in the South China Sea as it works to intimidate its neighbors and grab undersea oil and gas resources.\n\nSocial\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party is quickly turning Hong Kong, once known for its freedoms and rule of law, into a giant prison camp. Meanwhile, out in Chinese East Turkestan (Xinjiang), the communist regime has reportedly imprisoned millions of Uyghur Muslims in what looks like an ongoing cultural genocide.\n\nAs for free speech and basic human rights, ask the NBA about that. Or Activision\u2019s World of Warcraft, where players of the massively multiplayer online role-playing game have been banned for expressing support for the protesters in Hong Kong.\n\nAt least South Park has gotten it right when it comes to kowtowing to the Chinese Communist Party, even if it did result in all traces of the long-running show being wiped from the Chinese internet.\n\nCorporate Governance\n\nThe risk to U.S. investors, including billions in pension funds, is enormous.\n\nAs for corporate transparency, how is it that 156 Chinese companies listed on American stock exchanges with a combined market value of $1.2 trillion, are allowed access to American capital without having to meet U.S. audit standards? The risk to U.S. investors, including billions in pension funds, is enormous.\n\nIf ESG investing is to be taken seriously, it must properly consider those ESG principles in China. The damage to the environment, human rights abuses, and the utterly corrupt corporate governance there ought to be a focus of honest and even handed ESG investing.\n\nIf not, applying ESG guidelines and complementary public policy only to America will simply shift more investment and jobs from clean and safe America, where workers enjoy freedom and dignity, to China, where both the environment and people are subordinated to the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nChuck DeVore is a vice president with the Texas Public Policy Foundation and served in the California State Assembly from 2004 to 2010.", "description": "With the Chinese Communist Party and its official mouthpieces calling foul on the NBA over free speech issues, how might that lesson apply to American investors?
