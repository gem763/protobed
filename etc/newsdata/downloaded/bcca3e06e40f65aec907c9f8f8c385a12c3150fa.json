Before the board\u2019s creation in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, there was little oversight of the audit profession at all. Auditors fought its creation and settled for it as an alternative to outright government oversight of the profession. The P.C.A.O.B. is a hybrid: It is a private-sector, self-funded (through fees paid by audited companies) nonprofit. And in the end, the S.E.C. has to approve any regulations approved by the accounting board.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of political oversight for a nonpolitical board, and even so, the auditing profession has sought to check the P.C.A.O.B.\u2019s powers, as it did in 2012, as the board\u2019s chairman at the time, James Doty, cited auditor quality problems following the 2007-09 financial crisis.\n\nChairman Clayton of the S.E.C. is weakening the accounting board at a particularly critical time: Even sophisticated venture capital and private equity investors are regularly surprised by the shoddy practices at pre-I.P.O. companies they oversee closely, like WeWork. What chance do ordinary investors have if auditor quality is not checked closely?\n\nThe P.C.A.O.B. is the only body that has the power to force auditors to explain their work and justify their findings. In our market system, investors have to trust that the independent auditor is truly independent \u2014 and the accounting board must enforce that standard.\n\nYet the P.C.A.O.B. is doing less oversight and inspection work than it once did, and key positions at the agency are unfilled. Morale is reportedly low.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the more prosaic but no less important work of the board. Members of the auditing profession would love nothing more than to see their P.C.A.O.B. audit quality inspections get a little softer and more deferential. They wouldn\u2019t mind having a friendlier ear on the board when it comes to patching up the holes that the P.C.A.O.B.\u2019s inspectors expose \u2014 what is called the remediation process. They would love to have a solid majority of board members ready to vote on any new carve-out of audit requirements for companies that have a good story to tell (except when it comes to their income statements).\n\nIn short, what\u2019s at risk isn\u2019t a specific regulatory function of the P.C.A.O.B.; it\u2019s the independence and the credibility of the board and its staff as a whole. If the Trump White House\u2019s goal is to strip the P.C.A.O.B. of its power, it doesn\u2019t have to write new rules or pass new laws. It has only to nominate board members who don\u2019t want to exercise the power they have. That\u2019s all it takes \u2014 and I worry it\u2019s happening right before our very eyes.\n\nMr. Levitt was chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission from 1993 to 2001.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
