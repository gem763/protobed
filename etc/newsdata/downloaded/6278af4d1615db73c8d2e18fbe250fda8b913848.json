The FA are also considering a 2018 Instagram video in which Bernardo describes Mendy, who is wearing an all-black outfit, as \u201cnaked\u201d.\n\nKick It Out, the football anti-racism body, described the mascot as a \u201cracist stereotype\u201d and criticised Bernardo\u2019s post as \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d. The FA could yet fine or suspend Bernardo if he is found guilty of discriminatory behaviour.\n\nSterling has taken an influential stance against racism within football and, in an interview with Sky Sports on Saturday night, he admitted he could see why some may find Bernardo\u2019s post offensive.\n\nBut, referencing only Bernardo\u2019s tweet and not the 2018 video, Sterling called on the FA to show leniency and take his team-mate\u2019s intentions into account.\n\n\u201cIt is a situation that no-one needs at this moment in time. It is a situation between two friends, Bernardo and Mendy as everyone knows,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI can see exactly the point where some people can get \u2018touchy-feely\u2019 on it but I feel in that situation Bernardo made a joke to his friend, he has not referred to his skin colour, he has not referred to his lips, in both pictures they have both got small heads.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing for me is that he didn\u2019t refer to a colour. Everyone can see that Mendy is a black lad, we have got to be proud to be black as well.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cIt is really sad to see someone like Bernardo be, like the whole week, be kind of down about it because he is not that way inclined.\n\n\u201cAs I keep going on about, they are two really good friends, it is really sad to see. I can understand where the criticism has come but I don\u2019t feel it was no way intentional of trying to be racist. Its not because its my team-mates, it is just I don\u2019t see any racism in it.\n\n\u201cBut I can exactly see the point where people have come from. Bernardo is deeply sorry about it. He is not in the wrong for me but at the same time I can see where people think it is wrong.\n\n\u201cWe have just got to be smarter on social media. We understand in this day and age, anything you say and anything you do can quickly be judged and it is just a really sad situation at this moment in time.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, City manager Pep Guardiola doubled down on his claim that Bernardo\u2019s tweet was simply \u201ca joke\u201d between friends, that any punishment would be a mistake and that the images were \u201csimilar\u201d.\n\nGuardiola\u2019s stance has been criticised but Sterling said: \u201cI think the club, as I always believed, handled the situation right.\n\n\u201cThe sooner the FA can realise that this was no way intending to be discrimination, there is not one moment he uses a negative term to speak about his skin colour. That is the most important thing.\n\n\u201cHe tried to make a joke and that joke wasn\u2019t the best one but we have got to move on and understand it wasn\u2019t intentional.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nEverton vs City: Five things we learned as champions earn big win\n\nSterling seals victory for Man City in tense encounter at Everton\n\nGuardiola doubles down on defence of Silva over racism accusations", "description": "Raheem Sterling has come to the defence of Bernardo Silva after his Manchester City team-mate was accused of posting a discriminatory tweet.The Football Association are investigating after Bernardo appeared to compare team-mate Benjamin Mendy to the mascot of Spanish confectionery brand Conguitos.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/XoZ.kgm1KUZtCZy9wPCQ0A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEwNTI7aD03ODg-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/c04pVqg8ewEUBBkAfwX7Pg--~B/aD0zOTQ7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/418516f2e488bc13fde813d96629ccec", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
