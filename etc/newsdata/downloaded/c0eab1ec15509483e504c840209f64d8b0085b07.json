The power plant was built in the 1930s to supply the massive amount of energy needed to run Union Station and its surrounding infrastructure. The Amtrak-owned plant closed in 2011 when that power was no longer needed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still hoping to find a developer that can reuse it and to get the city involved,\u201d said Ward Miller, who heads the preservation group. \u201cWe want more opportunity to have (the public\u2019s) voices to be heard and determine if there is a way to avoid demolition.\u201d\n\nMiller told the Chicago Sun-Times this week that the power house is an example of the city\u2019s industrial roots and a monument to its history as a transporter of people and freight.\n\nAmtrak spokesman Marc Magliari said that although the company hasn\u2019t made its final decision on what to do with the building, the structure is deteriorating rather quickly and has safety issues.\n\nHe noted that Amtrak has made significant progress in planning for the demolition, but because preservationists have expressed an interest to reusing the structure, the company is open to preservation proposals, though there have been none.\n\n\u201cDespite considerable effort by Amtrak and our consultant - including multiple extensions of the deadline - no proposals were received,\u201d Magliari said.\n\nLast year, Amtrak unsuccessfully solicited proposals for how the structure should be reused.\n\nMiller acknowledged the project\u2019s difficulty. But he\u2019s hopeful that someone with the ambition and a creative set of eyes might find interesting ways to repurpose some of the building\u2019s industrial elements.\n\n\u201cWe understand this undertaking is a Herculean task,\u201d Miller said.\n\nPreservation Chicago worked with other groups to revitalize the old Cook County Hospital, Old Main Post Office and, with the cooperation of Amtrak, improvements to Union Station.\n\n\u201cThis could be another great example,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWe only have a handful of these old railroad buildings left.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Chicago Sun-Times, http://chicago.suntimes.com/\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A Chicago preservation group is struggling to find a developer to save a historical coal-fired power plant the owner says is deteriorating and presents safety concerns.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
