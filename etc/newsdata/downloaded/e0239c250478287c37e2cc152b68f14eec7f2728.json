Although efforts to declare \u201cwar on cancer\u201d go back to the Nixon administration, they have yielded less than one might expect. The overall death rate from cancer has fallen only 5 percent since 1950, which some attribute primarily to the decline in smoking since the 1990s rather than research. And new cancer drugs approved between 2003 and 2013 increased overall survival by an average of only 3.4 months. So much money and energy has been directed toward developing cancer drugs targeting rare, specific cancers \u2014 certainly benefiting individual patients and some types of cancer \u2014 but overall survival rates have barely budged. Why?\n\nCuring cancer is an enormously difficult technical and medical problem. But despite periodic pleas to eradicate cancer, the federal government hasn\u2019t actually invested large sums or directed researchers to focus on cancer. What we are seeing from pharma isn\u2019t a concerted effort to cure cancer, but a piecemeal response to a regulatory regime that has encouraged quantity over quality.\n\nAt the heart of this history is the \u201corphan drug\u201d designation. Originally passed in 1983, the Orphan Drug Act was designed to provide incentives for drug development when companies have \u201cno reasonable expectation that the cost of developing \u2026 will be recovered.\u201d In other words, the idea was to incentivize companies to develop drugs to tackle rare diseases, when there would be no hope of turning a profit and therefore no financial reason to develop a drug.\n\nThe legislation brought a host of benefits to pharmaceutical companies, the most valuable being a seven-year marketing right. During the seven-year period, the Food and Drug Administration doesn\u2019t grant any other company approval to market the same drug for the same orphan designation, even if the drug\u2019s patents have expired or are held invalid. Thus, orphan drug designations can help companies dominate the market on certain drugs without investing nearly as much into research and development as it would take to create all-new medicines.\n\nPassage of the orphan drug program depended on dramatic rhetoric and heart-rending storytelling. The hearings featured a Hollywood star reenacting a poignant dramatization. The popular television show \u201cQuincy, M.E.\u201d had featured an episode about the plight of a patient with a rare disease, including a scene of testimony before a fictitious Congress. Jack Klugman, beloved star of the show, reenacted that moment \u2014 providing actual congressional testimony in support of the Orphan Drug Act.\n\nEven the name Orphan Drug Act reflected drama, conjuring up the image of abandoned and neglected children. It was a brilliant strategic choice that made it difficult for anyone in Congress to oppose the idea. That rhetoric continues to this day with industry sources using language that sounds as if the diseases are neighborhood mafia dons: Rare diseases are described as \u201ctragically killing and brutalizing mostly children.\u201d\n\nDespite the benefits to drug companies, the industry response to the Orphan Drug Act was tepid. So Congress amended it in 1984 to include a simple litmus test. If a disease affected fewer than 200,000 people, a company could enjoy the benefits of the Orphan Drug Act. That number, 200,000, was not the product of thoughtful economic and scientific analysis, however. It was chosen to make sure the legislation covered two particular drugs. One treated narcolepsy, and the other treated multiple sclerosis; neither involved cancer.\n\nWith that change, however, the program took off like wildfire. Pharmaceutical companies began investing in drugs that would fit the new definition, assured that they would enjoy seven years of exclusivity, tax credits and expedited approvals.\n\nPeople with rare diseases \u2014 especially cancer \u2014 are often desperate for treatments, and drug companies have discovered that for orphan drugs, the sky\u2019s the limit on pricing, particularly when the government is keeping competitors away. As a result, the costs to consumers and insurers are staggering.\n\nFor example, one patient\u2019s annual bill for the drug Strensiq, which treats a debilitating genetic disorder, totaled close to $2 million last year. The impact on the patient\u2019s health plan, available through her husband\u2019s labor union, is sobering. As described in one account, 35 cents of every hour of pay for each of the union\u2019s 16,000 workers went to pay for that single patient\u2019s prescriptions for this one drug.\n\nOrphan drug designation has become associated with large-dollar returns. In fact, out of the 10 drugs with the highest annual sales revenue in 2015, seven were orphan drugs. Some drugs that receive orphan designations are indeed the product of expensive research targeted at solving rare diseases. But orphan drug benefits can go to drugs that already exist, are merely recycled, or that were developed for rare uses and became blockbuster drugs for large populations. The original goal of the act \u2014 to provide support when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the cost of research \u2014 has been lost in the stampede.\n\nChanging the Orphan Drug Act\u2019s gateway to a defined number, along with modern medical techniques that focus on genetic markers and variations, also set the stage for the industry\u2019s shift to focusing on cancer drugs. With advances in precision medicine, cancer treatments can be described in terms of small, targeted populations so that treating each of those populations can lead to multiple orphan drug designations.\n\nBy classifying so many cancers as rare diseases afflicting under 200,000 people each, this regulatory setup has unleashed a veritable tidal wave of oncology drugs. Of all the new drugs launched in 2018, oncology had the greatest number; three-quarters of these were orphan drugs.\n\nWhile the orphan indication has redirected investment into drugs that have proved lifesaving for some, this policy has actually directed funds away from diseases and conditions that affect far larger numbers of people. Of all the novel drug therapies that gained FDA approval last year, more than half had an orphan indication. It would be a strange world, indeed, if we intended to direct more than half of our energy into treating diseases that affect small numbers of people.\n\nThere are many other ways that the regulatory system directs industry toward cancer in an ad hoc manner. The clinical trial approval process, for example, is easier for cancer drugs than for other drugs \u2014 companies can enroll fewer patients and can use substitute endpoints, rather than actual results. Comparatively, the FDA makes life more difficult for non-cancer drugs \u2014 disincentivizing investment in other health-care needs that affect large numbers of people, such as birth control and antibiotics. In particular, despite concerns about the rise of drug-resistant bacteria \u2014 including a British report anticipating 10 million deaths a year by 2050 \u2014 research in the antibiotics space is declining.\n\nAt the moment, it appears that the regulatory programs that have directed focus to cancer drugs incentivize torrents of activity with disappointingly minimal effects on extending the quality and quantity of life. There have been wonderful successes for individual patients, as well as substantial progress in treatment for particular types of cancer, such as breast cancer and Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. But the overall death rate from cancer has barely budged since 1950.\n\nThe big question is whether the societal focus on cancer is beneficial, particularly considering that the outcome driven by our regulatory scheme developed in a manner unintended in scope or direction. These efforts could be tiny steps along the path of eventual success, but no budget is limitless, and no health-care system can engage in a cancer moonshot without diverting energy from other health goals. When engaging in a moonshot, it is best to do so with one\u2019s eyes open, given that flying blind is a marvelous way to crash and burn. The greatest risk is not only that our moonshot may fail, but that the nation\u2019s other public health needs will be left in the dust.", "description": "Rather than a concerted effort to cure cancer, pharmaceutical companies pour resources into \u201corphan drugs.\u201d", "authors": ["Robin Feldman", "Robin Feldman Is Author Of The New Book"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BOOO5EUUHEI6TFLKRDBJDK24HA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
