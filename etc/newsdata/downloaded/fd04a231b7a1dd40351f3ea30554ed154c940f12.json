When Buckingham Palace posted a recruitment advert for a butler last year, it made the job sound absolutely gruelling. Not only was it a seven-day, 45-hours-a-week position, but the salary paid almost \u00a32 an hour less than the London living wage. You would have thought that the literal queen of England might have had deeper pockets.\n\nMuch better, at least at first, is the butler vacancy recently posted to Jobs in Childcare by a wealthy Russian family, which pays three times more than the Buckingham Palace gig. However, it does come with a number of quite specific instructions. The successful applicant must live in London and speak at least two languages with, at minimum, a working level of Russian.

They must be able to \u201cbe a diplomat and be able to solve any issue at school, at a shop, at a salon for the benefit of the family\u201d. They must watch the televised adaptation of Jeeves and Wooster \u201cto see what is expected from the butler\u201d.
