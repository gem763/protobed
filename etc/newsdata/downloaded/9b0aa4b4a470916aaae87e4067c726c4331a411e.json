Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2019\n\nBy morning, #CivilWar2 was trending, and as more and more people woke up to discover that the president had compared his own potential impeachment to a violent war things felt pretty chaotic.\n\nAs always, though, a group of Twitter users decided to make light of the bizarrely unfunny situation by using the hashtag #CivilWarSignup to offer valuable war-related services \u2014 such as tweeting and potato salad-making.\n\nSEE ALSO: Seth Meyers uses hilarious sports mascot fails to explain Trump\u2019s John Bolton mess\n\nWithin hours, #CivilWarSignup began to trend, and now Trump has a bunch of volunteers should America be thrust into a Civil War Sequel-type scenario.\n\nWhile dress code for the war remains unclear, we do know that there will be several side dishes and comfort animals present.\n\nI\u2019ll bring paper plates. There are never enough paper plates.#CivilWarSignup \u2014 The Hoarse Whisperer (@HoarseWisperer) September 30, 2019\n\nHey y'all, Dan Quayle just called and wants to know if you would like him to bring potato salad or potatoe salad.#CivilWarSignup https://t.co/a0g4FJ4ds1 \u2014 Travis Akers (@travisakers) September 30, 2019\n\nAs soon as I\u2019m done with hot yoga, I\u2019ll be there. I\u2019m not so good with the fighting stuff but I\u2019ll help with the tweets. #CivilWarSignup \u2014 Molly Jong-Fast (@MollyJongFast) September 30, 2019\n\nI\u2019ll bring the charcuterie. Nothing says Civil War like cheese that smells like the inside of a soldiers boot and hard salami, all delicately placed on a hearty piece of artisan bread. #CivilWarSignup \u2014 \ud83e\uddd8\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud835\udd65\ud835\udd59\ud835\udd56 \ud835\udd57\ud835\udd66\ud835\udd65\ud835\udd66\ud835\udd63\ud835\udd56 \ud835\udd5a\ud835\udd64 \ud835\udd57\ud835\udd56\ud835\udd5e\ud835\udd52\ud835\udd5d\ud835\udd56 (@FeministBroad68) September 30, 2019\n\nPro tip: when the civil war breaks out do NOT join the side that puts raisins in potato salad.\n\n\n\nYou\u2019re welcome.

Can we get some spicy fried chicken and Mac and cheese or something not so elitist \ud83d\ude02 #CivilWarSignup \u2014 Luke G (@LukeGumbrecht) September 30, 2019\n\nI'll bring non-alcoholic beverages for those of us in sobriety...#CivilWarSignup \u2014 Travis Akers (@travisakers) September 30, 2019\n\nQuestion re the #CivilWarSignup. Will it be a catered affair, or is it a pot luck meal? I can choose appropriate attire based on the answer to this question. Thank you. \u2014 Eric Slater (@ericsslater) September 30, 2019\n\nI can help. I'm Adjunct Prof at Trump Univ Dept of Haberdashery & Clothey Things. Many people are asking what to wear to a civil war. Proper attire is NEVER a black tuxedo. Strictly inappropriate as any civil war fought only during daylight hours, hence: white tux #CivilWarSignup \u2014 Tomi Civil Ahonen (@tomiahonen) September 30, 2019\n\nCan I just bring my cat as a comfort animal for us ? #civilwarsignup pic.twitter.com/8f1oZJmrip \u2014 Luke G (@LukeGumbrecht) September 30, 2019\n\nChips and salsa. We\u2019ll need that. And I make a decent guacamole.#CivilWarSignup \u2014 John A.
