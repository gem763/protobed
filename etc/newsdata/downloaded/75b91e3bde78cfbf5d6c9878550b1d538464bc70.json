(AP) - Kyle Duncan scored his first MLS goal in the opening minutes and Daniel Royer added a penalty kick in stoppage time to give the New York Red Bulls a 2-0 victory over the Portland Timbers on Wednesday night.\n\nThe Red Bulls (13-13-5), jockeying for home-field advantage in the playoffs with three games remaining, snapped a three-game losing streak.\n\n\u201cI think there was a sense of urgency, and we felt we had that last game, too, and you can throw the one in before that. Look, it\u2019s always tricky when you lose, because it puts you to the test,\u201d Red Bulls coach Chris Armas said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve talked a lot around here about being big in tough moments, and standing tall, keeping your head up and sticking together.\u201d\n\nIt was the second straight loss for the Timbers (13-13-4) and fifth at home this season, matching the team\u2019s mark for most home losses set in 2011, their first season in Major League Soccer.\n\nPortland has gone 2-4 in its last six games as it tries to secure a spot in the postseason with four games left. Last year, the Timbers advanced to the MLS Cup final.\n\n\u201cThe only way to go through it is to stay calm, to keep on working, and to make sure that these things don\u2019t get to you, because if you start worrying too much in regards to missing opportunities and not being able to score, then you lose the belief,\u201d Timbers coach Giovanni Savarese said. \u201cAnd what you have to always have is the belief that you can achieve things and that\u2019s what we need right now: to make sure we keep believing in ourselves.\u201d\n\nThe Timbers had just 16 players available on Sunday when they fell 1-0 to D.C. United. Portland\u2019s top scorer, Brian Fernandez, was back in the starting lineup against the Red Bulls after missing the previous game with a stomach illness.\n\nZarek Valentin, who missed the United game because of the birth of his first child, also started. Sebastian Blanco, who had a calf injury, was available on the bench.\n\nRoyer, Bradley Wright Phillips and Kaku did not start against the Timbers. Wright-Phillips and Royer came in as substitutes in the second half.\n\n\u201cIt was a huge win for us, but more importantly, I thought it was a really strong performance, especially with our backs against the wall,\u201d Red Bulls midfielder Sean Davis said. \u201cI think we showed our best stuff, so we should be proud of that.\u201d\n\nDuncan scored for the Red Bulls in the third minute on a cross from Marc Rzatkowski. They nearly went up by another goal in the sixth minute when Rzatkowski\u2019s rebound was cleared by Bill Tuiloma.\n\nDuncan, a defender, is in his second season in the league. Assigned recently to the team\u2019s USL team, he was making his first appearance with the Red Bulls since July.\n\nThe Red Bulls were awarded the penalty in stoppage time after Jorge Moreira took down Rzatkowski in the box.\n\nPortland\u2019s best chance came in the 19th minute when Diego Chara got a clear look at the goal but his shot caromed off the crossbar. Jeremy Ebobisse had another chance in the 82nd minute but his shot went just inches wide.\n\n\u201cWe play good games. If you think about the games that we have lost points here at home, most of them we have played better than the rival. Sometimes the result doesn\u2019t reflect the way of the game,\u201d Timbers captain Diego Valeri said. \u201cBut at the end, soccer is all about efficiency, it\u2019s all about moments where you can change the game, and this is a moment where we have to be very smart and focused on it.\u201d\n\nThe Red Bulls were coming off a 4-2 loss at Seattle on Sunday. Red Bulls goalkeeper Luis Robles played at the University of Portland, where the team practiced between the match against the Sounders and Wednesday night\u2019s game.\n\nRobles said it felt like one of the biggest wins of the season.\n\n\u201cIt feels like it, especially coming off of three losses. When we played Seattle on the weekend, we thought the game was there for us, and we got unlikely with the own goal. But this is a remarkable group, there\u2019s a lot of resiliency in it.\u201d\n\nThe Timbers were hurt when Cristhian Paredes had to be stretched off in the 73rd minutes. He was replaced by Blanco.\n\nThe Red Bulls host the Philadelphia Union on Sunday while the Timbers host Minnesota.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Kyle Duncan scored his first MLS goal in the opening minutes and Daniel Royer added a penalty kick in stoppage time to give the New York Red Bulls a 2-0 victory over the Portland Timbers on Wednesday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Anne M.
