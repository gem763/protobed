And yes, he still has plenty to say about his sons\u2019 basketball careers.\n\nIn the past few months, Lonzo and LaMelo have distanced themselves from Big Baller Brand amid an alleged embezzlement scheme by former co-founder Alan Foster. Lonzo has yet to wear Big Baller Brand shoes this preseason, and LaMelo has worn the Nike KD 12 sneakers in his games with the Illawarra Hawks in Australia.\n\nWith LaMelo attracting legitimate buzz as a top-five pick in the upcoming NBA draft, the major shoe brands have considered endorsement deals for the youngest Ball brother, according to reports. But according to LaVar, his sons will never leave Big Baller Brand.\n\nTMZ caught up with LaVar over the weekend, and he was defiant when faced with the possibility of his sons leaving the seemingly defunct Big Baller Brand for an established shoe company. About Lonzo, specifically, LaVar said:\n\n\u201cLonzo can think all day. He ain\u2019t sign with nobody. Big Baller Brand. That\u2019s what I said.\u201d\n\nIn a recent episode of \"Ball in the Family,\" Lonzo said his plans for this season were to remain a \u201cfree agent\u201d and not sign with any company \u2014 Big Baller Brand included. LaMelo said he would consider all options.\n\nYet despite LaVar\u2019s insistence that his two talented sons won\u2019t sign elsewhere, Big Baller Brand hasn\u2019t acted as a functioning company for months. The website has been \u201cunder construction\u201d for five months, and the company held a clearance sale at a high school volleyball tournament.\n\nWhen Lonzo told his father the brand was \u201cdemolished,\u201d he wasn\u2019t kidding. It\u2019s time for LaVar to face reality and let his sons do what is best for them.", "description": "LaVar Ball was defiant when asked about possibility of his sons Lonzo Ball and LeMelo Ball leaving Big Baller Brand for an established shoe company.", "authors": ["Andrew Joseph", "Published P.M.
