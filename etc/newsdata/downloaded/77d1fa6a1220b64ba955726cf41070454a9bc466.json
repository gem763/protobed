USC\u2019s upset of Utah and Washington\u2019s romp over BYU both were impressive in their own way. USC was forced to turn to backup QB Matt Fink to lead the 30-23 win over the Utes. Meanwhile, Jacob Eason was nearly flawless as the Huskies rolled to a 45-19 romp over the Cougars.\n\nKEY MATCHUP\n\nUSC\u2019s pass game vs. Washington\u2019s secondary. The Trojans\u2019 wide receivers made big plays throughout the victory over Utah. Michael Pittman Jr., Tyler Vaughns and Amon-Ra St. Brown all took their turns making big touchdown catches. It might not be as easy against a Washington secondary that has four interceptions in the past two games and has allowed one pass play of more than 28 yards all season.\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH\n\nUSC: Fink. All eyes will be on the third-stringer expected to make his first start. Fink was outstanding being called into action when Kedon Slovis was injured on the second play of the game, throwing for 351 yards and three TDs against Utah.\n\nWashington: WR Aaron Fuller. Washington\u2019s leading wide receiver is coming off one of the better all-around games of his career. Fuller had eight catches for a season-high 91 yards and a touchdown against BYU. He also took a punt back 88 yards for a score. Fuller has 21 receptions, and is one of three Washington pass catchers with more than 200 yards receiving.\n\nFACTS & FIGURES\n\nUSC has won five of the past six meetings in Seattle. It\u2019s the first meeting between schools since 2016 because of the Pac-12 scheduling rotation. \u2026 Washington RBs Sean McGrew and Richard Newton combined for 190 yards rushing on 34 carries and a TD in the win over BYU. \u2026 USC has not been shut out since a 27-0 loss at Washington in 1997. Three of the past four times the Trojans have been shut out, dating to 1983, have been by the Huskies.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "No. 21 USC (3-1, 2-0 Pac-12) at No. 17 Washington (3-1, 0-1), Saturday at 3:30 p.m. EDT (FOX).", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/21/washington_byu_football_96661_c0-182-4342-2713_s1770x1032.jpg?aec09725faa2efa5d05d73933f82a865c7ea80b5", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
