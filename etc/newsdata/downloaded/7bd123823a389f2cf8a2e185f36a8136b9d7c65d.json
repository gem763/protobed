Their clothing signify they hail from different cultures and historical upheavals, among them a Hasidic Jew escaping Nazi Germany, a Syrian fleeing civil war, a Polish refugee running from the Communist regime.\n\nHovering above the refugees' heads is a set of angel wings. Schmalz's website says the inspiration for his statue comes from a passage from Hebrews 13:2 in the New Testament: \"Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.\"\n\nThe inspiration for Angels Unawares comes from a passage from Hebrews 13:2 in the New Testament: 'Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.'

Bratty Family Foundation, a Canadian charity set up by Rudy Bratty, a developer and the son of immigrants from the northern Italian region of Friuli, funded Schmalz's work on Angels Unawares.\n\nIn an interview with CBC, Chris Bratty, a third-generation Canadian who was in Rome for the unveiling, said it was \"remarkable to be the patron of this sculpture,\" which \"represents my family over the last 100 years.\"\n\nHe said Angels Unawares \"represents Canada. Embracing other people is a Canadian trait,\" and the statue \"represents the hope and optimism of immigrants, which is important to Canadians..... that hope and optimism of a new beginning and the chance of a better life. It was important because Tim's sculpture shows the faces of the world.\"\n\nThe history of Angels Unawares\n\nSchmalz said Rev. Michael Czerny, a Canadian priest and the Pope's top adviser on the issue of migrants and refugees, and himself an immigrant \u2014 from Czechoslovakia \u2014 had urged him to begin work on a statue addressing migration.\n\nSchmalz said that, after his Homeless Jesus was installed at the Vatican, he and Czerny met, \"and he asked me to come up with a new design on the idea of migration that conveyed that migration is not a crisis, but something that people have done for thousands of years.\"\n\nIn 2016, the Vatican New Department of Refugees and Migration requested that he create the statue.\n\nThe Pope and four refugees from various parts of the world were at the unveiling of Angels Unawares, which is six metres tall. (Vincenzo Pinto/Reuters)\n\nSchmalz crafted a small model of the statue first. The Pope, who has made the advocacy of migrants and refugees a central part of his papacy, saw a photograph of the model and asked to bless it, which he did two years ago.\n\nOn Oct. 5, Czerny, a Montreal-raised Jesuit who has dedicated his life social justice issues, will be among the 13 men the Pope will elevate to cardinal \u2014 the highest rank in the Roman Catholic Church below the pontiff.\n\nAlong with the Angels Unawares sculpture now in St. Peter's Square for the next while, on Monday, a 1.5-metre version will be permanently installed in the Basilica of St. Paul Outside the Wall in Rome.\n\n'Something in 3D' moves people, artist says\n\nAfter the global success of Schmalz's Homeless Jesus series \u2014 with one now on its way to the Metropolitan Cathedral of Mexico City and another to be installed outside St. James United Church in Montreal in November \u2014 the artist said he has become a huge believer in the power of public art. The statue of a man wrapped against the cold and lying on a public bench is identifiable as Jesus by the holes in his feet.\n\n\"It's that tactile idea, of something in 3D, that can really move people, rather than just seeing a photograph.\"\n\nHe said numerous people contacted him saying Homeless Jesus moved them to set up homeless programs or donate to shelters in their cities.\n\nWith his latest work, Angels Unawares, positioned literally in the epicentre of modern-day Catholicism, the impact, Schmalz hopes, will be all the more transformative \u2013 both for those who see it, and his church.\n\n\"A lot of people may think the Vatican is just a museum,\" he said. \"The idea is that the church is not a museum, that it's a living, growing part of our world today.\"", "description": "A\u00a0Canadian artist's bronze statue depicting \"the different states of mind and emotion\" of refugees in a boat was unveiled Sunday in St. Peter's Square in Rome following a mass by the Pope, who decried indifference to the plight of migrants, on the World Day for Migrants and Refugees.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5301960.1569775183!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/pope-migrants.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
