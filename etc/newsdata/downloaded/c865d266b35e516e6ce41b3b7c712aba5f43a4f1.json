The water restrictions announced on Friday apply to the Liebenbergsvlei River from the Sol Plaatjie Dam just outside Bethlehem in the Free State.\n\nThe river ordinarily carries large amounts of water as part of the Highlands scheme.\n\nFor the duration of the tunnel shutdown, farmers on its banks have been forbidden from using it for irrigation during weekends, and farms on its two banks will only be allowed to draw water for irrigation on alternating weekdays.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:\n\n\n\n", "description": "The water minister believes \"that a water shortage is about to occur\", but only affecting agricultural users of the Liebenbergsvlei River.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9359/c5787b9ccc0540ac9b0b8f4a04debfd7.png", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
