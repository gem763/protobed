They released him about a year later, thinking he was a civilian agitator rather than a military threat.\n\nIn 2005, the father of five pledged allegiance to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of Iraq's al-Qaeda franchise.\n\nAl-Zarqawi was killed by an American drone attack in 2006, months later his followers and some faithful fighters broke away from al-Qaeda and named themselves the Islamic State of Iraq after merging with other armed groups on the ground.\n\nAfter al-Zarqawi's successor - Abu Omar al-Baghdadi - was also eliminated, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi took the helm in 2010.\n\nHe expanded the group, which became the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in 2012 upon its expansion into Syria.\n\n'Commander of the faithful'\n\nIt was not until July 4, 2014, that al-Baghdadi seized the world's attention, climbing the pulpit of Mosul's medieval al-Nuri mosque in black clerical garb during Friday prayers to announce the restoration of the caliphate.\n\n\"God ordered us to fight his enemies,\" he said in a video of the occasion, which presented him as \"Caliph Ibrahim, commander of the faithful\".\n\nThousands of volunteers flocked into Iraq and Syria from around the world to become \"Jund al-Khilafa\" - soldiers of the caliphate - and join him in his fight against the Shia-led Iraqi government and its Western allies.\n\nISIL ruled over millions of people in territory running from northern Syria through towns and villages along the Tigris and Euphrates river valleys to the outskirts of Baghdad.\n\nThe group claimed responsibility for or inspired attacks in dozens of cities around the world including Paris, Nice, Orlando, Manchester, London and Berlin, and in nearby Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Egypt.\n\nIn Iraq, it staged dozens of attacks on predominantly Shia Muslim areas. A truck bomb in July 2016 killed more than 324 people in a crowded part of Baghdad, the deadliest attack since the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq.\n\nThe group also carried out many bombings in northeast Syria, which has been under the control of US-backed Kurdish forces.\n\nMost of al-Baghdadi's speeches were distributed as audio recordings, a medium better suited to the secretive, careful character that for a long time helped him evade the surveillance and air raids that killed more than 40 of his top commanders.\n\nThat caution was matched by ruthlessness as he eliminated opponents and former allies, even within the movement's ranks. He waged war on al-Qaeda's Syrian wing, the al-Nusra Front, breaking with the movement's global leader, al-Zawahri, in 2013.\n\nBut by the time of his death in the US raid this weekend, his fortunes - and those of ISIL - were in rapid decline.\n\nWith the defeat of ISIL in its stronghold of Mosul, which was declared the capital of his caliphate, in 2017 the movement lost all the territory it once controlled in Iraq.\n\nIn Syria, ISIL lost Raqqa, its second capital and centre of operations, and eventually earlier this year its final chunk of territory in Baghouz was captured by the US-backed Kurdish forces.\n\nISIL sleeper cells\n\nWhile the destruction of the quasi-state that Baghdadi built has denied the group its recruiting tool and logistical base from which it could train fighters and plan coordinated attacks overseas, most security experts believe ISIL remains a threat through clandestine operations or attacks.\n\nISIL is believed to have sleeper cells around the world, and some fighters operate from the shadows in Syria's desert and Iraq's cities, still launching hit-and-run attacks.\n\nIn his most recent audio message, in September, al-Baghdadi put on a brave face, saying operations were taking place daily and urging followers to secure freedom for women jailed in Iraq and Syria over their alleged links to the group.\n\n\"As for the worst and most important matter, the prisons, the prisons, oh soldiers of the caliphate. Your brothers and sisters; do your utmost to free them and tear down the walls restricting them,\" al-Baghdadi said.\n\nThe loss of territory forced him to travel incognito in ordinary cars or farm pick-up trucks between hideouts on both sides of the border, escorted only by his driver and two bodyguards.\n\nThe region was familiar territory to his men. It was the hotbed of the Sunni movement against first the US forces in Iraq and then the Shia-led governments that took over the country.\n\nFearing assassination or betrayal, he was not able to use phones and trusted only a handful of couriers to communicate with his two main Iraqi aides, Iyad al-Obaidi, his defence minister, and Ayad al-Jumaili, his security chief.\n\nThe two had been believed to be among the likely candidates to succeed al-Baghdadi, but Jumaili was killed in April 2017 and Obaidi's whereabouts are unknown.\n\nBut their military background and lack of religious credentials mean that any of al-Baghdadi's deputies would struggle to inherit his claims to be caliph.", "description": "Born Ibrahim Awad al-Samarrai near the Iraqi capital Baghdad, ISIL's self-proclaimed 'caliph' killed in US raid aged 48.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/27/7610db746f9e4fee8d937a59f20e3d7f_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
