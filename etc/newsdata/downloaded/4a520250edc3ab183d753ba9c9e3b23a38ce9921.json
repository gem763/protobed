The Argentine missed the first four La Liga games of the campaign due to a calf problem, but has still managed to score two goals and register four assists in six appearances.\n\nRonaldo, 34, has started this term a lot better than he started the last, netting five goals and assisting one from 10 appearances.\n\nIf international football is included in the debate, Ronaldo has the edge over his rival.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n(Image: Alex Livesey/Getty Images)\n\nCombining both players stats from their UEFA Nations League and Copa America tournaments with this seasons stats: Ronaldo has 15 goals and one assist in just 18 appearances, meanwhile, Messi only has eight goals and four assists in one more game.\n\nThroughout their international careers, Ronaldo has been superior to Messi.\n\nThe former Manchester United ace won the 2016 UEFA European Championship and this year's UEFA Nations League, whilst also holding the record for the most goals in a Euro campaign, with nine goals.\n\nPortugal\u2019s record goalscorer recently notched the 700th goal of his career in a 2-1 loss to Ukraine and is fast approaching his 100th international goal, currently sitting on 95, in 162 appearances.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\n(Image: PAULO NOVAIS/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nWhereas, Argentina captain Messi has scored 68 goals from 136 appearances. Finishing as runner-up in the 2014 World Cup, 2015 Copa America and then again in the 2016 Copa America Centenario.\n\nMessi did of course retire from international duty back in 2016 but returned to the side for the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers in September 2016, and played a big part in their qualification campaign, scoring a hat-trick against Ecuador to ensure their third place finish.\n\nBoth players have yet again been nominated for this years Ballon d\u2019Or but will face tough competition from Liverpool and Netherlands centre-back, Virgil Van Dijk, who could become only the second player to beat Ronaldo and Messi to the trophy in 11 years.\n\n2018 was the first time in 11 years where Lionel Messi controversially finished outside of the top three in the Ballon d\u2019Or rankings.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo \u2019s ex-teammate Paul Scholes weighed in on the debate during an interview with ESPN, saying: \u201cMessi (is the best) but Ronaldo is brilliant. Ronaldo is sensational at what he does, with pace and power.\n\n\u201cHe score, he takes free-kicks. But as an all-round footballer, Messi - wow, his passing - has absolutely everything.\u201d", "description": "Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are considered the greatest players in the world but how do the Barcelona and Juventus stars stack up this season", "authors": ["Josh Keeble-Wells", "Image", "Bt Sport", "Getty Images", "Alex Livesey Getty Images", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Paulo Novais Epa-Efe Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20656506.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Messi-and-Ronaldo-react-to-bizarre-Cantona-speech.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
