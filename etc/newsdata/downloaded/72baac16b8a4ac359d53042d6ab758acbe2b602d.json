She will know [about my future]. I hope she does.\u201d\n\nThursday\u2019s press conference was Draghi\u2019s swan song after eight years leading the ECB. At his final meeting, the institution left policy unchanged from its September decision to cut its interest rate and resume buying bonds to keep the eurozone economy afloat.\n\nReporters used the occasion to probe Draghi on his legacy as well as his future, which earlier this year was rife with rumors that he'd return to Rome to become the president of the republic.\n\nChristine Lagarde, the former boss of the International Monetary Fund, will take the ECB\u2019s helm on November 1 with little central banking experience.\n\nDraghi declined to offer any advice for the 63-year-old French lawyer amid economic uncertainty and divisions among policymakers over the ECB\u2019s easy-money program.\n\n\u201cShe knows perfectly well what she has to do,\u201d Draghi said. \u201cAnd by the way, she has a long period of time ahead during which she will have to form her own view together with the [ECB] Governing Council about what to do.\u201d", "description": "\u2018She will know,\u2019 the outgoing ECB president says of his plans. \u2018I hope she does.\u2019", "authors": ["Bjarke Smith-Meyer"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1174174121-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
