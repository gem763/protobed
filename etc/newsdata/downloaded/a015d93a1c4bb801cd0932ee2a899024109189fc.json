REUTERS/STRINGER\n\nSunday\u2019s decline extended a losing spree for Saudi stocks, which in recent weeks have been hit by expensive valuations, weak oil prices and concerns about the economic outlook.\n\nThe drone attacks were carried out by Yemen\u2019s Houthi group, its military spokesman said on Al Masirah TV.\n\nThe index has lost all its gains this year and is down about 18% from its 2019 high of 9,403 points seen in early May.\n\nOn Sunday, the index was down 1.8% year-to-date.\n\nThe index\u2019s earlier gains were fueled by Saudi Arabia\u2019s entry into the MSCI and FTSE Russell\u2019s emerging market indices.\n\n\u201cThere is no real positive news on the horizon with the index inclusion story over,\u201d said Muhammad Faisal Potrik, head of research at Riyad Capital.\n\n\u201cThe market was expensive versus the region and other emerging markets, plus second-quarter earnings were not good.\u201d\n\nOther Gulf markets also reacted negatively to the attacks, with Kuwait\u2019s premier index .BKP down 1.1% and Dubai stocks .DFMGI falling 0.8%.\n\n\u201cSentiment is negative because of yesterday\u2019s attacks on Aramco facilities. But this is temporary and the market will pick up towards the end of the day,\u201d said a trader in Riyadh, who asked not to be identified.\n\nSaudi Basic Industries (2010.SE), the kingdom\u2019s biggest petrochemicals firm, was down 3.3% after it said it had curtailed feedback supplies by about 49% following the attack.\n\nOther petrochemical companies such as Yanbu National Petrochemicals Co (2290.SE) and Kayan (2350.SE) also announced significant reductions in feedstock supplies.\n\nThe attacks come at a bad time for Saudi Arabia, which is preparing for the listing of oil giant Saudi Aramco on the Tadawul bourse in Riyadh later this year.\n\nThe attacks are unlikely to change plans for Aramco\u2019s long-awaited initial public offering but may affect the valuation, risk consultancy Eurasia Group said in a note.\n\n\u201cThe latest attack on Aramco facilities will have only a limited impact on interest in Aramco shares as the first stage of the IPO will be local. The international component of the sale would be more sensitive to geopolitical risks,\u201d it said.\n\nAramco has hired nine banks as joint global coordinators to lead its IPO, slated to be the world\u2019s largest, Reuters reported, citing two sources.", "description": "Saudi stocks <.TASI> plunged 2.3% as the market opened on Sunday, after attacks on two plants at the heart of the kingdom's oil industry a day earlier knocked out more than half of Saudi crude output.", "authors": ["Saeed Azhar", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190915&t=2&i=1430039894&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8E03R-OCABS", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
