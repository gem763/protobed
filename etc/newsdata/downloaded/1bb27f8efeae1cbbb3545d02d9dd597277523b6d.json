It features facial recognition doors, robotic arms at the bar and even robots that deliver items to guest rooms.\n\nAlibaba hopes the property will be a model for what a hotel of the future may look like.\n\nUpon arrival, I noticed the lobby was completely bare: no check-in counters, no concierge, and no receptionists.\n\nAs a foreigner, however, I was quickly greeted by a staff member, who used a mobile device to take a photo of my passport and my face. Then she told me my room number and offered to email the receipt.\n\nAndy Wang, CEO of Alibaba Future Hotel, claims the data recognition information is only kept during the duration of the guests' stay and is not kept on record.", "description": "Imagine skipping hotel check-in and walking straight to your room with a scan of your face. This could soon become a reality at many hotels in China and around the world.", "authors": ["Uptin Saiidi", "Saheli Roy Choudhury"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106161513-1570069691615alibabaflyzoohotel0000011.jpg?v=1570069817", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
