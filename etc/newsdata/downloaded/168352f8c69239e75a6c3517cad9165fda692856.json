It\u2019s not like turning a tap on and off, there are literally twenty taps going at once and when one gets turned off, another might get turned up.\u201d\n\nThose concerns are amplified by the fact that a number of the banks have already begun the process of ending commission payments and there is no legal requirement for consumers to be rebated until the legislation's effective date.\n\n'No legal obligation'\n\nLiberal Senator Dean Smith wrote to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission on June 21 raising questions about a letter from ANZ superannuation subsidiary OnePath \u2013 which is in the process of being sold to IOOF \u2013 to members inviting them to \"consider their adviser payment arrangements\" in light of the then-unlegislated Hayne recommendation that they be ceased.\n\nA response to Senator Smith from ASIC official Joanna Bird, seen by The Australian Financial Review, confirmed that there was no law preventing ANZ or any of its competitors from retaining the payment should a consumer request it be ceased.\n\n\"The government is committed to ensuring that the benefits of removing grandfathering flow to clients,\" Ms Bird wrote.\n\n\"However, I note that in the period leading up to 1 January 2021 ... there is no legal obligation on product manufacturers to either stop making these grandfathered payments or, if they do stop, to rebate the payments to consumers.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe government has tasked ASIC with conducting an investigation to monitor and report on the extent to which the industry is ceasing commissions in the period between 1 July 2019 and the 2021 deadline and passing on payments to consumers.\n\nPre-empting the law\n\nAll four of the big banks and AMP have told the Financial Review they will cease the payment of commissions by January 1, 2021, with varying processes and timelines underway.\n\nCommonwealth Bank's Colonial First State (CFS) wealth management business has invited its financial adviser customers to switch off commissions and rebate the amount to super fund members. The bank ceased grandfathered commissions flowing from some CFS products to its internal salaried financial advisers in January 2019, well ahead of the legislation's passage or even the Hayne final report.\n\nIt\u2019s not like turning a tap on and off, there are literally twenty taps going at once. \u2014 Erin Turner, Choice\n\nANZ began ceasing grandfathered payments to advisers in its salaried advice channel on 1 April 2019 and a spokesperson told the Financial Review that \"thousands of customers have benefited from this\".\n\n\"If a customer requests to cease paying commissions, it is rebated back to the customer and ANZ does not benefit in any way,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nWestpac's BT Financial Group also moved pre-emptively, switching off all grandfathered commissions to its salaried and aligned financial advisers by 1 October 2018. The bank has not switched off commissions to external advisers due to \"contractual obligations\" but pledged to do so by 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Unintended consequences'\n\nThe process of product providers pre-emptively ending commissions in the absence of legislation compelling them has angered sections of the financial advice industry, which Choice estimates receives between $1.5 and $2 billion each year in grandfathered payments.\n\nThe Association of Financial Advisers has warned of a number of unintended consequences where ending commissions could result in consumers losing Centrelink and capital gains tax benefits in certain circumstances.\n\nThe process of rebating commissions to customers could also result in unintended consumer harm, the industry body said.\n\n\"The payment of a rebate to a client will in many cases be taxable income and in the case of partial age pension clients, this may reduce the client's pension by 50 cents in the dollar,\" AFA policy manager Phil Anderson said.\n\n\"In a limited number of cases, it may push the client above the maximum income test threshold for the pension.\"\n\nJohn Ardino, chairman of Lifespan Financial Planning, has predicted that fund managers switching off commissions will simply claw back the revenue in fees, echoing concerns flagged by Choice.\n\n\"There isn't any legislation to prevent fund managers from raising their management fees if they incur more costs because of increased service levels to orphaned clients,\" Mr Ardino said.\n\nA number of financial advisory groups are seeking to challenge the federal government's ending of commissions in the High Court, claiming the law amounts to expropriation of property rights.\n\nASIC has declined multiple invitations to comment on its grandfathered commissions investigation.", "description": "ASIC and consumer groups are nervous that the big four banks will not pass on the benefits of ending financial adviser commissions to consumers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.6444%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b2998c31fa12c28bcfe04ca68d49c2e31b849adf", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
