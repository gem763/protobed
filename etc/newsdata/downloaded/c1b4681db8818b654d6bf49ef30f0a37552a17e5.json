He ran to the scene, rushing to help terrified people as best he could, though they could not understand his words.\n\n\u201cAll I could do is see which people needed helped help the most,\u201d he said. One devastated man was cradling his dead wife. Driedonks wrapped his arms around them both, he said, until paramedics arrived.\n\nAll 31 people on board were hurt, Utah highway patrol Sgt Nick Street said. Twelve remained hospitalized on Saturday, five in critical condition.\n\nMost were in St George, where Mandarin speakers were gathering to translate as well as find clothes and shoes for people left with nothing. The crash threw their suitcases into the desert, said De He, a school district administrator coordinating the effort.\n\nThe tour bus had come from Las Vegas on Friday morning, the passengers seeing the canyons of Zion national park before heading for the otherworldly red-rock landscape of Bryce Canyon national park, He said. Most were older adults.\n\nNot everyone was wearing a seatbelt when the bus from a tour company in southern California rolled, crushing its roof and ramming the guard rail\u2019s vertical posts into the cab, Street said. The death toll could rise, he added.\n\nThe crash happened near a highway rest stop a few miles from Bryce Canyon. The top of the white bus could be seen smashed inward and one side was peeling away as the vehicle came to rest.\n\nAuthorities believe the driver swerved but when he yanked the steering wheel to put the bus back on the road the momentum sent it into a rollover crash.\n\nThe driver, a US citizen, survived and was talking to investigators, Street said. The driver did not appear intoxicated but authorities were still investigating his condition as well as any possible mechanical problems, he said.\n\nThere was some wind but not strong enough to cause problems, Street said. The National Transportation Safety Board was sending a team to investigate.\n\nThe company listed on the bus was America Shengjia. Utah business records indicate it is based in Monterey Park, California. A woman answering the phone there did not have immediate comment.\n\nMillions visit Utah\u2019s five national parks every year. Last year, about 87,000 people from China visited the state, making them the fastest-growing group of Utah tourists, according to state data. More than half of visitors from China travel on tour buses, said Vicki Varela, managing director of Utah Office of Tourism.\n\nThe Chinese embassy tweeted that it was saddened to learn of the crash and that it was sending staff to help.", "description": "Bus carrying 31 visitors from China was travelling from Zion national park to Bryce Canyon in southern Utah when it crashed on highway", "authors": ["Associated Press In Panguitch"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/369828551bc6beb3c51cdcc4b4c6a815db3b0490/0_154_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6c44bfab3e9acabf8d69fb55bec87f93", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
