He was named as a defendant last week, along with co-executor, Darren K. Indyke, in a new civil suit from a Jane Doe plaintiff who claims she was routinely abused and exploited for three years by Epstein at his New York home around 2002 when she was 14 years old or younger.\n\nThree other women have filed 'Jane Doe' suits against Epstein's estate alleging rape and sexual assault. One woman claimed he continued to abuse her up to 2014.\n\nKahn, who has no social media presence and has not been pictured publicly before, has now been placed front and center in the Epstein scandal in his role as co-executor.\n\nKahn did not respond to multiple voicemail and email messages from DailyMail.com requesting comment.\n\nExecutor of Jeffrey Epstein's estate, Richard Kahn, was seen at Epstein's home, one day after the convicted pedophile's suicide in August, in pictures exclusively obtained by DailyMail.com\n\nKahn, 46, is a longtime business associate of Epstein and was named co-executor of Epstein's estate in his Last Will & Testament\n\nKahn emerged from Epstein's mansion after about 45 minutes with a blue bag of items taken from the home, followed by a man believed to be one of three of Epstein's employees\n\nDressed in a a red hoodie, shorts, sunglasses and with a baseball cap pulled low, Kahn went inside the $77million-dollar property on Manhattan's Upper East Side\n\nKahn and an Epstein employee got into a waiting SUV. He was driven around the corner where he climbed into a Range Rover\n\nKahn and a man believed to be an employee of Epstein's went into the house for 45 minutes and then emerged with a blue gift bag\n\nEpstein's 71st Street townhouse on Manhattan's Upper East Side is valued at $77million. A woman claims she was about 14 years old when she was lured to Epstein's mansion (above) and was paid hundreds to give Epstein massages that escalated into sex acts\n\nThe day after Epstein's suicide, Kahn entered Epstein's 71st Street townhouse.\n\nDressed in a T-shirt, shorts, sunglasses and with a baseball cap pulled low, Kahn went inside the $77million-dollar property after a man, believed to be an employee of the late financier, raced from a waiting car and unlocked the door.\n\nBefore his suicide in jail in August, Epstein revealed he had 'potentially damaging' dirt on high-powered figures\n\nThe pair spent around 45 minutes inside, before Kahn emerged in a red hoodie, carrying a medium-sized blue shopping bag and got into a waiting a car with the employee. He was driven around the corner where he climbed into a Range Rover.\n\nThe following day, the New York Times published an account by journalist James B, Stewart who had interviewed Epstein in August 2018.\n\nIn the course of their conversation, Epstein told Stewart that he had filed away dirt on his famous house guests, 'some of it potentially damaging or embarrassing, including details about their supposed sexual proclivities and recreational drug use'.\n\nStewart added: 'So one of my first thoughts on hearing of Mr. Epstein's suicide was that many prominent men and at least a few women must be breathing sighs of relief that whatever Mr. Epstein knew, he has taken it with him.'\n\nThe names of hundreds of people linked to Epstein could be made public if court documents, which are part of a defamation lawsuit by alleged victim Virginia Giuffre, are made public.\n\nGiuffre has claimed Epstein and his cohort, British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, allegedly trafficked her for sex while she was a teenager. Maxwell has repeatedly denied the claims and called Giuffre a liar.\n\nVirginia Giuffre, nee Roberts, told the Daily Mail in February 2011 that she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew on Epstein's orders when she was 15.\n\nThe defamation case was settled on undisclosed terms. More than 900 filings in the suit had remained secret until August, when a federal appeals court unsealed about 2,000 pages.\n\nA federal judge in New York has said parties on both sides will have a chance to make arguments about what should be public and what should remain secret.\n\nKahn, pictured leaving Epstein's mansion in February, was named as a defendant last week, along with co-executor, Darren K. Indyke, in a new civil suit by one of Epstein's alleged victims, who is not identified\n\nKahn, who has no social media and has not been pictured publicly before, has now been placed front and center in the Epstein scandal in his role as co-executor\n\nKahn spent time at Jeffrey Epstein's New York mansion while the millionaire was in town in February. He was inside for about two hours\n\nMaxwell's lawyer, Jeffrey Pagliuca, said at a hearing earlier this month that the documents contained 'hundreds' of names of people who would need to be notified and given a chance to object before they were released.\n\nEarlier this month, lawyers for one John Doe petitioned the New York court, asking that the names of the people in the documents, who were not party to the lawsuit, be kept secret.\n\nBritish socialite Ghislaine Maxwell has been named as Epstein's cohort who allegedly trafficked young girls for sex. Maxwell has repeatedly denied the claims\n\nEpstein, 66, who had faced decades in jail on sex trafficking charges, hanged himself in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in lower Manhattan on August 10. He had pleaded not guilty to charges of sex trafficking involving dozens of underage girls as young as 14, from at least 2002 to 2005.\n\nEpstein's cellmate had been transferred and the financier was not on suicide watch at the time of his death, despite an apparent attempt to take his own life weeks earlier.\n\nThere have been numerous questions as to how Epstein, a friend of President Donald Trump, Prince Andrew and Bill Clinton among other high-powered figures, had been able to take his own life.\n\nThe FBI and the DOJ have opened investigations into his suicide. It was later revealed that the guards on duty had not checked on Epstein in three hours before he was found dead and had falsified records in a logbook.\n\nEpstein was discovered to have put his affairs in order just two days before his suicide.\n\nHe named Kahn and Indyke, a longtime Epstein lawyer, as co-executors and his brother, Mark Epstein, 65, a multimillionaire property developer, as sole heir to his estimated $577million fortune.\n\nBut it is that from fortune which victims, who have lost the opportunity to have their day in court against Epstein since prosecutors dropped the case, are now seeking compensation.\n\nFederal prosecutors for the Southern District of New York, who led the case against Epstein, vowed that the investigation would not end with his death and would now focus on the financier's network of associates.\n\nVirginia Roberts, told the Daily Mail in February 2011 that she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew on Epstein's orders when she was 15\n\nRoberts is pictured as a teenager with Prince Andrew in 2001 before they allegedly had sex\n\nSix of Jeffrey Epstein's alleged victims have come forward in an interview special investigative edition of Dateline NBC, Reckoning\n\nKahn lives in a luxury doorman apartment building, a few blocks from Epstein's mansion, on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, where apartments sell for around $3.3million.\n\nLisa Kahn, believed to be his wife, is also listed on property records for the apartment and Kahn is believed to have at least one daughter.\n\nLisa Kahn also has no apparent social media and it is unclear what she does for a living.\n\nPrior to his August visit, Kahn was seen by DailyMail.com spending around two hours at Epstein's townhouse in February, while the financier was in town.\n\nKahn has held a CPA license for the accounting industry, according to public records, although there is no record of his employment to be found publicly.\n\nIn one record of a political donation with the Federal Election Commission, Kahn, gives his occupation as 'attorney'.\n\nA Daily Beast investigation in August first revealed that Kahn took over as president of Epstein's shadowy foundation, Gratitude America Ltd in 2015.\n\nGratitude America has held tax-exempt status as a non-profit since 2012 but only began making charitable donations, to the tune of almost $2million, which registered in the tax years of 2016 and 2017.\n\nThe non-profit was established after Epstein completed his 18-month jail term in 2010, in an apparent move by the convicted sex offender to rehabilitate his reputation in society.\n\nEpstein had pleaded guilty in a Florida state court to two felony offenses, including a prostitution charge with a person under 18 \u2013 despite the fact he had been accused of having sex with victims as young as 14.\n\nThe deal, now much maligned, was struck by his high-powered attorneys and federal prosecutors, including Trump's former Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta, who resigned in the wake of the scandal.\n\nEpstein was allowed to spend much of his sentence on work release from the low-security Palm Beach County Stockade, sometimes up to 12 hours a day.\n\nKahn was spotted in in New York earlier this month. He is the president of Gratitude America and has served on Jeffrey Epstein's non profit ventures\n\nEpstein named Kahn and Darren Indyke (right) as co-executors and his brother, Mark Epstein (left), 65, as sole heir to his estimated $577million fortune\n\nEpstein put his affairs in order just two days before his suicide, naming his co-executors and brother as the sole heir\n\nHe worked at another non-profit that he appeared to have set up especially \u2013 the Florda Science Foundation, that was shuttered when he finished his jail term.\n\nHe later infamously told the New York Post that he wasn't a predator on children but a sexual 'offender'. According to Epstein it was the difference 'between a murderer and a person who steals a bagel'.\n\nKahn was listed in public records as the president of Gratitude America Ltd and Indyke as the treasurer, with an address in a 35-story office building on Lexington Avenue in Manhattan.\n\nErika A Kellerhals, another longtime attorney for Epstein who specializes in tax in the U.S. Virgin Islands, is listed as secretary.\n\nAccording to public records, Epstein's non-profit operated from 9053 Estate Thomas, Suite 101, St Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands \u2013 the same address as Kellerhals' law firm, Kellerhals Ferguson Kroblin PLLC.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that Epstein had used Gratitude America Ltd for his own benefit. The financier allegedly spent the money to cut himself tax breaks and to allegedly avoid violations relating to construction on his Virgin Islands home.\n\nIn 2015, Gratitude America Ltd received a one-off $10million from a company called BV70 LLC, according to Buzzfeed News.\n\nThe address listed is 445 Park Avenue, New York \u2013 the same as the Leon and Debra Black Family Foundation.\n\nKahn is listed as director and treasurer of the now-shuttered C.O.U.Q Foundation Inc and the CEO of RDK Asset Management Inc. C.O.U.Q is listed as a donor to the Clinton Foundation in the $10,000-$25,000 donors' bracket\n\nEpstein claimed that he had filed away dirt on his famous house guests, 'some of it potentially damaging or embarrassing, including details about their supposed sexual proclivities and recreational drug use', which could include Prince Andrew\n\nThe family foundation had listed Epstein as a director until 2012 \u2013 which was chalked up to a recording error, according to Forbes.\n\nBlack, the billionaire founder of private equity firm Apollo Global Management and the current chairman of MoMA in New York, later received $225,000 for his charity, the Melanoma Research Alliance, that he founded with his wife Debra.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Black emailed employees in August in an effort to distance himself from the late pedophile.\n\nThe Melanoma Research Alliance and Apollo Investment, Black's company, did not respond to requests for comment to DailyMail.com.\n\nIn recent years, the recipients of Epstein's largesse through Gratitude America Ltd reportedly received close to $2million.\n\nThey have included of the great and good of elite society along with storied academic institutions and prestigious arts and cultural centers.\n\nGratitude America gave thousands of dollars in 2016 and 2017 to health non-profits including the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York; the Crohn's Colitis Foundation of America and the Women Global Cancer Initiative Inc.\n\nIn a statement to DailyMail.com, the Mount Sinai Health System responded regarding Donations from Jeffrey Epstein: The Mount Sinai Health System has a deep and long-standing commitment to ensuring the health, safety, and dignity of rape, sexual assault, and domestic violence survivors.\n\n'Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s reprehensible behavior is completely antithetical to these values. As a result, we will be contributing a sum equal to the donations we received from Mr. Epstein and his foundation to a charity focused on preventing human trafficking and sexual exploitation, as well as providing financial support for the work of our Sexual Assault and Violence Intervention Program, which provides immediate medical treatment and counseling, and public education around issues of sexual and domestic violence.'\n\nThe other nonprofits did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSome of the biggest donations went to charities of men that he had crossed paths with both socially and professionally.\n\nOne of the biggest donations - $375,000 \u2013 went to the International Peace Institute Inc. with an address at United Nations Plaza in New York.\n\nThe think-tank is led by Terje R\u00f8d-Larsen , a former Norwegian Deputy Prime Minister and special envoy to the UN and employs former United Nations staffers.\n\nThe International Peace Institute did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nGratitude America Ltd also gave $150,000 to both MIT and the Kuhn Foundation in 2017, according to tax returns. Robert Lawrence Kuhn, a fellow at MIT and investment banker, is the creator of the PBS science series, Closer to Truth, and expert on China.\n\nAccording to the Daily Beast, Kuhn recorded his donation from the 'Jeffrey Epstein Foundation' in care of 'Richard Kahn KBRK Associates 57'.\n\nKahn operates several other companies - HBRK Associates Inc; ARC Holding Inc; K & F Capital Corp and Arkay Capital Corp, according to public records. 'KBRK Associates 57' appears to be noted mistakenly for HBRK Associates.\n\nMIT and the Kuhn Foundation did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Hasty Pudding Institute of 1770, the Harvard social and theatrical club, received $50,000 from Epstein's charity in 2016.\n\nEpstein, who dropped out of NYU, was known to cultivate his links with the Ivy League school. The Hasty Pudding is the oldest social club in America and former members include JFK and both Presidents Roosevelt and Adams.\n\nThe Hasty Pudding Institute did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Hewitt School, an all-girls school on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, received $15,000 from Epstein's non-profit.\n\nFootage from 1992 at Mar-a-Lago showed Trump and Epstein ogling NFL cheerleaders during a party at his estate. Some of Esptein's biggest donations went to charities of men that he had crossed paths with both socially and professionally at Mar-a-Lago\n\nIn a statement to DailyMail.com, a Hewitt spokesperson said: 'The Hewitt School received a gift from Gratitude America Ltd. in 2016. Upon learning of the foundation's background several months ago, the School immediately returned the funds. Hewitt has had no other contact with the foundation or with anyone related to the foundation.'\n\nEpstein also donated $30,000 to a Harlem preschool, The O'Gorman Garden, and gave $25,000 to the Junior Tennis Champions Center in College Park, Maryland.\n\nThe O'Gorman Garden and Junior Tennis Champions Center did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAnother notable beneficiary of Epstein's wealth was 'Friends of Elton John', according to 2017 tax returns, which received $15,000. The address listed is the same London address as the Elton John AIDS Foundation.\n\nA spokesperson from the Elton John Aids Foundation declined to comment to DailyMail.com\n\nIn public records, Kahn is also listed as director and treasurer of the now-shuttered C.O.U.Q Foundation Inc and the CEO of RDK Asset Management Inc.\n\nC.O.U.Q is listed as a donor to the Clinton Foundation in the $10,000-$25,000 donors' bracket.\n\nThe Clinton Foundation did not respond to DailyMail.com's request for comment.\n\nKahn was also an active political donor and his donations were made in a similar pattern to Epstein and Indyke.\n\nIn 2018, the three business associates each gave the maximum donation allowed for an individual - $2,700 \u2013 to a primary campaign for Stacey Plaskett, Democratic Congresswoman for the U.S. Virgin Islands, according to Federal Election Commission data.\n\nKahn also made contributions to Plaskett in 2014 and 2016, as did Indyke.\n\nTrump and Epstein were close friends until a falling out, the president claims. Pictured in 2000 with the future first lady, Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell\n\nFollowing Epstein's arrest in July, Plaskett told CNBC that she would donate Epstein's contributions to women and children's charities after initially saying she would not.\n\nIt is unclear whether she would be also be returning the campaign contributions given to her by Epstein business associates, Kahn and Indyke. Her spokesman, Mike McQuerry, did not respond to a request for comment by DailyMail.com.\n\nEpstein, Kahn and Indyke also made large donations to New Mexico gubernatorial candidate Gary King's campaign in 2014, according to Buzzfeed.\n\nIn June 2014, Kahn's business, HBRK Associates Inc., gave King $5,200, shortly after Indyke donated the same amount, according to Buzzfeed.\n\nEpstein followed that up with more than $35,000 in donations to King, through a network of companies, the Santa Fe New Mexican reported. King later said he would return the money.\n\nKing's father, the late Governor Bruce King, sold the 10,000 acre Zorro Ranch in Stanley, New Mexico to Epstein in 1993. It became another location where Epstein would allegedly fly young girls and sexually assault them.\n\nAt the formal end of the case against Epstein, Judge Richard M. Berman invited the women who claim to have been victimized by the late financier to share their stories.\n\nOne Jane Doe told the federal courtroom: 'When I was 15 years old, I flew on Jeffrey Epstein's plane to Zorro Ranch, where I was sexual molested by him for many hours. What I remember most vividly was him explaining to me how beneficial the experience was for me and how much he was helping me to grow.'\n\nEpstein donated $50,000 to political campaign funds for former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson in 2006. He later donated those funds to charity.\n\nIn 2007, public records show that Kahn and his wife, along with Indyke and his wife, all donated $2,300 to his presidential campaign.\n\nRichardson was recently named in unsealed court documents by Giuffre as one of the powerful men that Ghislaine Maxwell ordered her to have sex with. A spokesman for the governor denied the allegations.", "description": "Co-executor of Jeffrey Epstein's estate Richard Kahn was seen at Epstein's home just one day after the convicted pedophile's suicide, in pictures exclusively obtained by DailyMail.com.", "authors": ["Louise Boyle In New York For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/24/17/18879034-0-image-a-127_1569341712751.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
