I had a plan in my head about what I wanted to do and Chris was in my corner on how I wanted to ride the horse.\u201d\n\nNature Strip, part-owned by All Blacks coach Steve Hansen and also trained by Waller, led for most of the race until Yes Yes Yes and Santa Ana Lane powered past in the dying stages.\n\nSeven-year-old Redzel, which won the first two Everests and was again ridden by Kerrin McEvoy, finished eighth. Nature Strip came fourth.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m getting emotional about is the ride she took us on,\u201d said Waller, close to tears after his biggest win since the mighty Winx, considered perhaps the greatest racehorse ever, retired earlier this year.\n\n\u2013 Riches at stake \u2013\n\nSince its inception in 2017, The Everest has progressively boosted prizemoney from its initial Aus$10 million to Aus$14 million this year.\n\nEven the horse that came last, Ten Sovereigns, walked away with Aus$400,000, with the cash bonanza easily topping the pool offered at the Melbourne Cup, which has been run on the first Tuesday in November since 1876.\n\nRaced over 1200 metres (3/4 mile or six furlongs), it brought together 12 of the world\u2019s best sprinters boasting countless titles under weight-for-age conditions.\n\nUnder an innovative concept, buyers are required to purchase a Aus$600,000 slot in the race and commit for three years, then do a deal with owners and jockeys to secure the top horses.\n\nThe idea for The Everest came from Racing NSW chief executive Peter V\u2019landys, who modelled it on the Pegasus World Cup in the United States, run over 1800m.\n\nBut it has been controversial with Racing NSW and the Australian Turf Club scheduling it in Sydney to clash with the Caulfield Cup meeting in Melbourne.\n\nAnd while it has caught the imagination, the lead-up this year was marred by the scandal surrounding the fate of retired horses.\n\nA push for a national traceability register has been stepped up in the aftermath, which would allow authorities to better track changes in ownership, and locations, of racehorses when they leave the industry.\n\nWaller said a small minority were letting down the majority with their treatment of horses.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to be accountable as to every horse that leaves our stable but obviously there\u2019s gaps that need looking at,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd if people that are harsh to animals, whether they be a racehorse or whether they be a hobby horse or any animal for that matter, they need to be dealt with.\u201d", "description": "Sydney (AFP) \u2013 Yes Yes Yes, trained by Chris Waller who steered Winx on an incredible, unbeaten 33-race run, stunned favourite Santa Ana Lane to win", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/18/3bc050_jockey-glen-boss-in-saddle-yes-yes-yes-collected-whopping-aus-05-million-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
