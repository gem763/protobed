It's not just little things like straws as big things like banning private health insurance, allowing people to come over the border illegally this morning to get government sponsored health insurance this afternoon,\" Spicer said on \"Hannity.\"\n\nCNN'S CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT SAYS NETWORK'S 7-HOUR CLIMATE CHANGE TOWN HALL ISN'T ENOUGH\n\n\"These are the things that Democrats are hurting themselves with that will come back and bite them in the general.\"\n\nSen. Harris, D-Calif., came out in favor of banning plastic straws Wednesday during CNN's climate change-focused town hall marathon.\n\nWhen asked what she would do as president to curb the country's reliance on \"single-use plastics,\" Harris pointed to the \"images\" of plastic bags and bottles that are found in the ocean and celebrated California's plastic bag ban.\n\nSpicer called her stance on straws \"inconsequential.\"\n\n\"I just don't fault a lot of these little picky things. I've been around campaigns long enough. There's a lot of little things that go on that are really inconsequential,\" Spicer said.\n\nThe former White House spokesman also took issue with the media painting Trump as a \"liar\" with \"evil intentions\" versus Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden who is labeled as \"gaffe prone.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"The idea that we call this funny and gaffe prone when in fact on one side it's a lie and it's misleading the other side it's funny and hysterical to watch is just wrong,\" Spicer told host Sean Hannity.\n\nFox News' Joseph A.
