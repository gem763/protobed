But what about those willing to go further and be arrested?\n\nExtinction Rebellion launched a wave of civil disobedience on 7 October to highlight the escalating climate emergency, and by yesterday, more than 1,700 people \u2013 including the Guardian columnist George Monbiot \u2013 had been arrested, with some now facing an anxious wait to find out what comes next.\n\nGuardian Money has spent the week looking at the possible financial implications of being arrested in this type of protest, and talked to lawyers, experts and those who have put themselves on the line for environmental causes.\n\nWe found that, depending on the outcome of arrests, those involved could face issues with their personal finances, including mortgages, insurance and future employment.\n\nOne of the big unknowns, say those behind the protests, is how many people will be prosecuted. Following previous Extinction Rebellion action, only about 10% of those arrested were charged, but it could well be higher this time. There has been a hardening of attitudes this week at the Home Office and the Metropolitan police, and the Met has warned it will be pushing for more prosecutions this time round.\n\nProsecutions can lead to unspent convictions and \u2013 while that might sound technical \u2013 it is these that can cause the biggest problems. Extinction Rebellion does not duck this issue on its website, which has downloads and FAQs covering this area. \u201cBefore attending an action, it\u2019s crucial that all rebels inform themselves about their rights as protesters and the possible consequences of arrest,\u201d it says.\n\nThis article is not designed to put anyone off participating in protests. The aim is to clearly spell out the implications that being arrested could have so individuals can make an informed choice.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Police officers arrest anti-fracking protesters outside a drill site in Balcombe, West Sussex.

It is likely that in the case of most of those charged this week, it will be for failing to leave a controlled area of London when instructed to do so by a police officer.\n\nOnce someone has been convicted, that conviction is deemed to be current \u2013 or unspent \u2013 for a period based on the sentence. The more serious the conviction, the longer it remains unspent.\n\nIn short, convictions are what insurers, mortgage companies, employers and other organisations do not want to see on your \u201cfile\u201d. For example, British Heart Foundation does not accept volunteers to work in its shops if they have any type of unspent conviction.\n\nJohn Briant, an Oxford-based criminal barrister who has been advising local Extinction Rebellion protesters about the implications of being arrested, says most of those previously arrested who chose to go to court have ended up with a conditional discharge of six months and/or a fine related to income. Conditional discharges are only considered to be spent at the end of that term \u2013 typically six or nine months.\n\nFor those who are fined in court, the conviction is only considered to be spent a year from conviction. Those given a community order face a year on top of the order\u2019s length.\n\nThe extraordinary 15-month prison sentences meted out to anti-fracking protesters are a much bigger problem, as the conviction is not considered spent for a further four years on top of the sentence.\n\nHome insurance\n\nIt may sound ridiculous, but a 70-year-old retired teacher who may have never claimed on their home insurance is unlikely to have their policy renewed once they reveal they have an unspent conviction.\n\nChristopher Stacey, a co-director of the charity Unlock, which was set up 20 years ago to help people with all types of convictions, says most big insurers will not renew, or issue a new household policy, when they learn someone in the insured household has an unspent conviction. Several insurers including Direct Line, LV= and Aviva told Money this was the case.\n\n\u201cGetting insurance can be a big problem for people with an unspent conviction. For those with existing house insurance, if you don\u2019t notify them of the change when you next renew, the firm could refuse to pay out if you later try to claim. We have seen this happen in the past, particularly when people have let their policy simply automatically renew,\u201d he says.\n\nConvicted protesters given a six-month conditional discharge would be fine if their renewal came up after it was considered spent. However, if it fell within the six months, it would be unlikely to be renewed \u2013 if you admit it. Unlock has produced a list of specialist brokers who will help those with an unspent conviction find insurance cover, but this is likely to come at a cost.\n\nSome insurers have a clause in their terms and conditions that requires the customer to inform them of a conviction, at any time. One of the UK\u2019s largest, Aviva, told Money it insists customers inform it of any new non-motoring convictions \u201cas soon as reasonably possible\u201d. It admits it could lead to a decline or cancellation of the policy, either at the time or at the point of renewal. As soon as your conviction is spent, you have no obligation to mention it to an insurer. The Unlock calculator can help with this.\n\nCar insurance\n\nCar insurers are not so obsessed with non-motoring convictions unless they are serious and relate to theft, fraud or handling stolen goods. Again, you will have to declare any unspent convictions at renewal. However, Aviva said it would insure a driver with a minor protest conviction who had an otherwise clean record \u2013 but again at a cost.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Police arrest anti-Brexit demonstrators during a sit-down protest in London in August.

If you accept a caution, that is considered to be immediately spent. However, it can have long-term consequences, as it stays on your police file for life \u2013 and will be likely to appear on any enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check carried out later.\n\nWhat about my credit file, bank account and mortgage application?\n\nThe credit reference agency Experian told us criminal fines and convictions have no impact on credit scores, and only a fraud conviction would show up as a \u201cmarker\u201d. Banks generally take a similar stance. Nationwide says it does not ask about criminal convictions when someone is opening an account. Only serious financial crimes such as money laundering, bribery, tax evasion or mortgage fraud would lead to account withdrawal, it adds.\n\nHowever, things become a bit murkier when it comes to mortgage applications, says Stacey at Unlock. Mortgage companies do ask about unspent convictions, and every year, the charity hears reports of people having their mortgage application seemingly turned down for this reason.\n\nStacey says most lenders will ask about criminal records \u2013 typically: \u201cHave you ever been convicted, or have any prosecutions pending for any criminal offence (other than motoring offences)?\u201d Under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974, spent convictions do not have to be disclosed as part of a mortgage application, irrespective of what questions are asked. Mortgage companies should be clear about this, but often aren\u2019t, he says.\n\nIf your conviction is unspent, you will need to disclose it.\n\nDo I need to tell my existing employer?\n\nRuby Dinsmore, an employment law specialist at Slater and Gordon, says: \u201cStrictly speaking, employees are under no legal obligation to tell their boss if they have been arrested or charged with an offence, but there are exceptions. For example, if their contract of employment states that they must disclose such matters, or the conviction affects their ability to do the job, such as a taxi driver banned from driving, or if they work in certain regulated professions.\u201d\n\nShe says honesty is usually the best policy, as the consequences could be much worse if an employer were to find out at a later stage.\n\n\u201cWhile information about arrests is not publicly available \u2013 unless an employer were to carry out an enhanced background check \u2013 details of charges and convictions are,\u201d Dinsmore says.\n\n\u201cAnd if the employer decided that their trust had been broken, that the person\u2019s behaviour posed a threat to colleagues or customers or had brought the business into disrepute, they could be within their rights to dismiss them, even before the outcome of any criminal case.\u201d\n\nWhat about future employment and the DBS check?\n\nFor many younger protesters, this will be the biggest issue, particularly if they decide to change career.\n\nMost big employers conduct a basic DBS check before they offer a new employee a contract. This will show up only unspent convictions and conditional cautions, which will not be a problem for most first-time environmental protesters.\n\nHowever, if you decide you want to work with children or vulnerable adults, even on a voluntary basis, and the organisation does an enhanced check, it will show all convictions \u2013 including spent ones \u2013 plus cautions and any other information the police deem to be relevant. Most cautions given to first-time Extinction Rebellion protesters would likely only come off their enhanced check after six years.\n\nIt would then be up to the employer to decide whether to carry on. Would a caution following a climate protest lead to a teacher being denied a job offer?\n\nIt is worth noting that plenty of people taking jobs in finance have been caught out after telling their employer they had no convictions, as they were spent, only to have the offer withdrawn when the employer did a DBS check. Arguably, as more people are arrested at climate protests, employers will have to stop lumping them in with every other convicted or cautioned person.\n\nFuture travel or work abroad could be affected\n\nGenerally, anyone travelling to the US for less than 90 days can travel under the visa waiver programme. However, if you have been arrested, you are ineligible to travel under the scheme, and will have to apply to the US embassy for a visa. A typical six-month conditional discharge given to a climate protester would probably not be grounds for a visa refusal, but the visa process can be a real pain. Equally, those planning to emigrate in later life will have to disclose any brushes with the law, and it could be a problem depending on the country.\n\nCase study: \u2018I think we were a little naive\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Miranda Cox locked herself in specially made arm tubes to block the entrance to Quadrilla\u2019s fracking site in New Preston Road, Lancashire. Photograph: Kristian Buus/In Pictures /Getty Images\n\nMiranda Cox, who was one of a number of people arrested after locking themselves to the entrance to Cuadrilla\u2019s fracking site near Blackpool, says environmental protesters need to go into the process with their eyes open.\n\nAlong with 11 others, she pleaded not guilty in 2017 to obstructing the highway, but was convicted. They each received a 12-month conditional discharge and had to pay a total of \u00a3270 in costs.\n\n\u201cLooking back on it, I think we were a little naive about the consequences. We knew we wouldn\u2019t be visiting America any time soon but we didn\u2019t really think about the other consequences. I think we were lucky that most of us were a bit older and we weren\u2019t about to make big career changes or similar,\u201d says Cox, 50, who was a councillor at the time.\n\nShe says she did not have insurance problems but others in the group have faced rises in car premiums. No one lost their job, she says, but she suspects that was more due to their circumstances.\n\n\u201cTo anyone thinking of joining an environmental protest I\u2019d say go for it, as you will be on the right side of history. However, you need to go into it with your eyes open. Being handcuffed and thrown in the back of a police van and spending several hours in a police cell was really unpleasant \u2013 much worse than I thought it would be,\u201d she says.", "description": "How being arrested on a climate or anti-Brexit protest could affect your job, mortgage or travel", "authors": ["Miles Brignall"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2db242bd7db6ffc669f9c3f0c2cae2bb7db26b98/0_26_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f64b285bf155fe7eac7d32ea9e7714c6", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
