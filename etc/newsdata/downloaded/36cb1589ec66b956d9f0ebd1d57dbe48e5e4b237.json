Even as there are those people who abuse and bully animals like dogs, there are those who just adore them.\n\nIn a video that is going viral on social media platforms like Facebook, a man can be seen dancing with a stray dog with no care in the world. It has to be one of the purest things on the internet today. Just a man, entertaining a dog who seems mildly amused, the person probably didn\u2019t even know that his moves were being captured on a CCTV.\n\nSokak k\u00f6pe\u011fi g\u00f6r\u00fcnce severken kafay\u0131 yiyorum :( pic.twitter.com/7de40imwej \u2014 II. Supermet (@bendemistims) October 12, 2019\n\nReportedly the video is from Turkey, and the man in the clip is Metin Can \u015eener who was on his way back home when he saw the dog on the street. The dog eagerly trotted towards the man, its tail wagging, which is probably a sign that they knew each other.\n\nThe man then broke into some killer moves, it looks more like he is entertaining the dog than dancing WITH it. The dog keeps wagging its tail, as can be seen in the video, and even though it does not break into any crazy dance moves, it is clearly interested in the dancing man and doesn\u2019t want him to stop. The man pets the dog occasionally and one can\u2019t really say that the pooch minds.\n\nDon't Miss 801 SHARES 3.5 K SHARES 14 K SHARES\n\nLater, we even found the picture of the man with the same dog on his Instagram. Clearly, that jamming session brought them close.\n\nAnother adorable video that has been doing rounds on the Internet is that of a baby koala mistaking a dog for its mother and clinging to him.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Tony, the little dog, did not seem very pleased by the clingy behavior of the koala, probably because it could not fathom what this dude from another species altogether, was doing on its back. He seems to be trying to jerk the little cuddly creature off with as much might, as the koala seems to be employing to hang on.\n\nI\u2019ll just go back to actively look out for more cute videos now.", "description": "The true personality of a person can be known by how they behave with animals when they think no ones watching.
