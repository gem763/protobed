We're not going to hide anything,\" General Javier Iturriaga told reporters.\n\nLater in the morning, interior ministry sub-secretary Rodrigo Ubilla declined to identify the 15 people killed since last Friday.\n\nIn a heated exchange with reporters, he said 11 people had died in arson attempts, looting and rioting in Santiago, while two people had died of gunshot wounds. Two others died in vehicle-related accidents, one outside of Santiago and one, further south, in the port city of Talcahuano.\n\nThe Talcahuano prosecutor said that case involved a 23-year-old man run over by a military vehicle.\n\nThe Chilean Institute for Human Rights said by Monday night it had registered 84 people injured by firearms.\n\nAmnesty International on Tuesday said in an open letter to Pinera that it was concerned over human rights violations, and limitations imposed by the military during city-wide evening lockdowns.\n\n\"The sole fact that some groups or people have committed acts of violence in a protest does not authorize security forces to dissolve them with the use of force,\" Amnesty International Americas director Erika Guevara said.\n\nU.N. human rights boss Michelle Bachelet, a former president of Chile, called on Monday for independent investigations into the deaths in weekend protests, citing \"disturbing allegations\" of excessive use of force by security forces.\n\n\n\n\n\nSANTIAGO RUBBLE\n\nThe widespread protests sowed destruction across the city. Street cleaners and working parties of volunteers on Tuesday struggled to tidy and repair Santiago's central Plaza Italia, the focal point of much of the unrest, was littered with broken glass and stone, graffiti and still-smoldering fires.\n\nMany downtown streets still reeked of tear gas, and the majority of schools across the city remained closed on Tuesday.\n\nTraffic and public transportation were snarled across the city during the morning commute.\n\nRoxana Yanez, 56, a factory worker, said she had had a difficult commute.\n\n\"On the one hand, we support these protests. We don't earn much, just enough to pay our bus fare,\" she said. \"What we don't support is disorder, riots, looting. That doesn't help.\"\n\nThe protests were sparked by an increase in public transport fares in early October. But they reflect simmering anger over intense economic inequality in Chile, as well as costly health, education and pension systems seen by many as inadequate.\n\n\"This won\u2019t stop until people see real change,\" said Brandon Rodriguez, 25, a security guard. \"Governments of the left and right have come and gone...but nothing changes for ordinary people.\u201d\n\nThe unrest has yet to dock copper output in Chile, the world's top producer, mining officials said.\n\nWorkers at BHP's Escondida copper mine, the world's largest, nonetheless initiated a 5-hour strike Tuesday morning, union officials told Reuters.\n\nAt Santiago's international airport, many passengers were stranded after hundreds of flights were canceled by major airlines over several days and airlines laid out camp beds on the airport forecourt to accommodate them.
