He told French President Emmanuel Macron by phone that the EU shouldn\u2019t be \u201clured into the mistaken belief that the U.K. still stay in the EU after Oct. 31,\u201d his office said.\n\n\u201cWe will be packing our bags and walking out,\u201d Johnson wrote in the Sun on Sunday. \u201cThe only question is whether Brussels cheerily waves us off with a mutually agreeable deal, or whether we will be forced to head off on our own.\u201d\n\nBut Johnson is issuing contradictory messages. The government has repeatedly said it will obey a law passed by Parliament compelling the premier to request a Brexit delay if he can\u2019t get an agreement by Oct. 19. A senior official in his office said on Sunday it would be an historic misunderstanding if EU leaders thought Johnson\u2019s domestic opponents could prevent a no-deal departure.\n\nSecuring a Brexit deal is the only obvious way to obey the law and see through Brexit at the end of the month. But the indications from the EU are that proposals Johnson made last week to resolve the impasse won\u2019t cut it. As time ticks down to Brexit day, there were no negotiations over the weekend.\n\nIn other developments:\n\nMacron aside, Johnson also spoke with his counterparts from Finland and Portugal over the weekend and plans to talk to more leadersJohnson\u2019s EU envoy, David Frost, will have discussions with the European Commission, while Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay is on a three-day tour of European capitalsThe government said it\u2019ll consider publishing the legal text of its latest Brexit proposal if deemed helpful to move negotiations forwardLabour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn will host other opposition party chiefs on Monday to agree on next steps to thwart a no-deal Brexit\n\nJohnson\u2019s Brexit blueprint would see Northern Ireland remain in regulatory alignment with the EU for manufactured goods, livestock and agricultural products, so long as the region\u2019s political leaders agree to the arrangement every four years. But he\u2019s had push-back from the EU, whose chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, told senior diplomats on Friday that the British blueprint falls far short of his conditions for a deal.\n\nScope For Movement\n\nBarclay suggested there\u2019s room for the U.K. to alter its position on customs checks between Ireland and Northern Ireland, and on how to determine consent by Northern Ireland. \u201cOf course in the mechanism as part of the intensive negotiations, we can look at that,\u201d he told the BBC.\n\nTime is short to reach a consensus. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said Saturday it\u2019d be \u201creasonable\u201d to expect an improved U.K. offer by Friday, while Latvian Prime Minister Krisjanis Karins told the BBC on Sunday that \u201cthe EU doesn\u2019t have a whole lot of wiggle room,\u201d because of the difficulty in getting 27 nations to agree.\n\nFinnish Prime Minister Antti Rinne, who holds the EU\u2019s rotating presidency, told Germany\u2019s Welt am Sonntag newspaper that he doesn\u2019t expect any U.K. proposal to emerge that could be acceptable before the Oct. 17-18 leaders\u2019 summit in Brussels.\n\nThat\u2019s left the British press speculating about whether Johnson will delay Brexit, something he\u2019s said he\u2019d rather die in a ditch than do. The Sunday Telegraph, citing two cabinet ministers, reported that if forced to delay, Johnson plans to sabotage the EU by possibly blocking its seven-year budget, and sending a Euroskeptic commissioner to Brussels -- possibly even Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage. Suggestions like that may give EU leaders doubts about approving an extension.\n\nEarly Election\n\nAnother theory circulating at Westminster is that the premier could ask another country to veto an extension: a notion dismissed as \u201ctittle-tattle\u201d by Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick. \u201cI\u2019ve not heard any serious talk of that,\u201d he told Sky News on Sunday.\n\nThe Labour Party\u2019s spokeswoman on legal matters, Shami Chakrabarti, told the BBC on Sunday that there\u2019s no way around the law for Johnson. \u201cIf you send the letter as you are required to under the law and then seek to undermine it by other means, you have not kept faith with the law,\u201d she said. \u201cThat would be unlawful conduct.\u201d", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Follow\u00a0@Brexit,\u00a0sign up\u00a0to our Brexit Bulletin, and\u00a0tell us your Brexit story.\u00a0Prospects of a Brexit deal faded after talks between the two sides stalled and European leaders cast doubt on reaching an agreement in time for Halloween.Boris Johnson struck a defiant tone on Sunday, saying", "authors": ["Alex Morales"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
