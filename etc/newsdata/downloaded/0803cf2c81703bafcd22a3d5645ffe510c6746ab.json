They do not have to buy in. Castro: You just said that. You just said that two minutes ago. You just two minutes ago that they would have to buy in. Biden: They do not have to buy in if you can\u2019t afford it. Castro: You said they would have to buy in. Biden: Your grandmother would not have to buy in. If she qualifies for Medicaid, she would automatically be enrolled. Castro: Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago? Are you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago? I mean, I can\u2019t believe that you said two minutes ago that they had to buy in and now you\u2019re saying they don\u2019t have to buy in. You\u2019re forgetting that.\n\nIt is doubtful most viewers would have appreciated the nuances of what Biden and Castro were discussing even if Castro hadn\u2019t taken a remarkably transparent jab at Biden\u2019s age\u2014which was in turn followed by Castro summarily rejecting Pete Buttigieg\u2019s attempt to play peacemaker. \u201cThis reminds everybody of what they cannot stand about Washington,\u201d Buttigieg said, \u201cscoring points against each other, poking at each other, and telling each other that\u2014my plan, your plan. Look we all have different visions for what is better\u2014\u201d\n\nCastro cut him off. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s called the Democratic primary election, Pete,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s called an election.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s possible all of this landed more poorly among most debate viewers than it did among progressives on social media who have been openly questioning Biden\u2019s mental acuity since he entered the race. There are a fair number of people roughly as old as Biden within the primary electorate, and polls routinely show that Democratic voters have a favorable opinion of just about everyone in the field. On top of that, Democrats tend to prefer amiable politicians. Yet Cory Booker, an evangelist for finding common ground and winning change through what he calls a \u201cconspiracy of love,\u201d was willing to defend and echo Castro in the post-debate spin room. \u201cCastro has some really legitimate concerns about, can [Biden] be someone in a long grueling campaign that can get the ball over the line?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd he has every right to call that out.\u201d\n\n\n\nAll of this is obviously about toppling Biden from his perch atop the polls. Nevertheless, it\u2019s notable that Castro and Booker would see hitting Biden on his age as a safe way of doing that. Both are professional strivers and loyal party men\u2014Castro, of course, was a member of the Obama-Biden cabinet\u2014who must at this point, given their position in the polls, be thinking about their likely post-primary futures as much if not more seriously than they\u2019re thinking about the possibility of winning the nomination. As recently as 2016, securing a stable future in Democratic Party politics would have meant going along to get along with people like Biden and his backers\u2014contest the primary, sure, but respect the man.\n\n\n\nBut the Democratic culture of intra-party civility and deference to party elders has frayed significantly over the past few years. We\u2019ve seen it in the open tensions between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the progressive members of her caucus. We\u2019ve seen it in the willingness of party activists, like those of Indivisible and the Sunrise Movement, to sharply criticize, confront, or threaten primary challenges against esteemed moderates like Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, and Senator Dianne Feinstein. And we\u2019ve seen it, too, in all the previous jabs against Biden, which are often hits\u2014implicitly or explicitly\u2014against Barack Obama\u2019s policy record.\n\n", "description": "Guardians of civility are shocked when, at a Democratic debate, a debate occurs.", "authors": ["Osita Nwanevu"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/54804a303293b823d2bf905bca8bc845a654e201.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
