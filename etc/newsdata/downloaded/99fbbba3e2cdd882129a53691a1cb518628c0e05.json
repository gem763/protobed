Richard Shelby Richard Craig ShelbyFight over Trump's wall raises odds of 'continuous' stopgap measures McConnell support for election security funds leaves Dems declaring victory Hillicon Valley: Zuckerberg courts critics on Capitol Hill | Amazon makes climate pledge | Senate panel approves 0M for state election security MORE (R-Ala.), the top appropriator in the Senate, said it\u2019s possible Congress will spend the next fiscal year passing several stopgap bills, known as continuing resolutions (CRs).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"I don't know if we'll end up in a shutdown, but we could end up with continuous CRs,\" he said. \"That could be the endgame.\"\n\nLawmakers are hoping to avoid a repeat of December's fight over Trump\u2019s border wall, which led to a 35-day partial government shutdown, the longest in U.S. history.\n\nIn the first two years of Trump\u2019s presidency, negotiators resolved the wall issue by agreeing to put a very limited amount of funding toward rebuilding pedestrian fencing and reinforcing existing border barriers. That solution allowed both sides to claim victory \u2014 Trump could say money was going toward the wall, while Democrats could say nothing new was being built.\n\nBut ever since Trump\u2019s emergency declaration to build the wall following the last shutdown, the spending fight has spread beyond the lone homeland security bill that deals with border issues.\n\nDemocrats, and even some Republicans, fumed after Trump used presidential emergency powers to reprogram military funds toward building the wall. Both chambers rebuked him for the action, passing a bill to overturn his emergency declaration, but they could not muster the support needed to override Trump\u2019s veto.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump has since redirected $2.5 billion in Pentagon drug trafficking funds, $600 million from the Treasury Department's asset forfeiture fund and, most recently, $3.6 billion in military construction funds.\n\n\u201cThe president may not care about our system of checks and balances, but every one of us here should,\u201d Sen. Patrick Leahy Patrick Joseph LeahyFight over Trump's wall raises odds of 'continuous' stopgap measures Hillicon Valley: Zuckerberg courts critics on Capitol Hill | Amazon makes climate pledge | Senate panel approves 0M for state election security Senate committee approves 0 million for state election security efforts MORE (Vt.), the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said on the Senate floor this month.\n\nWith Democrats now demanding safeguards to prevent Trump from using newly appropriated funds for the wall and refusing to backfill military accounts emptied for wall construction, the problem has metastasized from the homeland security bill to other spending measures such as defense and military construction and veterans affairs' bills.\n\nDemocrats have also accused the GOP of dipping into a labor, health and education spending bill to provide $5 billion in new funds for the wall. Republicans pulled both that bill and the one covering the State Department and foreign operations as Democrats readied amendments blocking the Trump administration on abortion rules.\n\nThe amendments, Republicans said, violated a top-line spending deal reached in the summer prohibiting so-called \u201cpoison pills,\u201d or controversial policy riders.\n\nThose skirmishes, combined with the larger wall fight, raise serious questions about whether Congress will get any spending bills for fiscal 2020 signed into law.\n\n\"I'm not going to faint dead away if we end up with a CR for the whole year,\" said Sen. John Kennedy John Neely KennedyMORE (R-La.), an appropriator.\n\nBoth parties, however, dislike the prospect of governing on a continuing resolution, which would freeze spending at current levels and block agencies from initiating new projects.\n\n\"None of us would like that,\" said Shelby. \"It's not good for the military. It's not good for the administration. It's not good for the Democrats.\"\n\nAfter Democrats blocked a package of bills that included defense and health funding from advancing in the Senate this past week, Leahy suggested that smaller bills unencumbered by controversy \u2014 energy and water, transportation, and housing and urban development \u2014 could progress.\n\n\u201cMy hope is they\u2019ll sober up in the Senate, come to a deal, and then we can go to conference \u2014 we have the vehicles to get there \u2014 and then we\u2019ll fight this out,\u201d said Rep. Tom Cole Thomas (Tom) Jeffrey ColeFight over Trump's wall raises odds of 'continuous' stopgap measures Senate spending talks go off the rails as soon as they begin Social determinants of health \u2014 health care isn't just bugs and bacteria MORE (R-Okla.), an appropriator.\n\nBut even if some bills make it through the Senate, they might not make it to President Trump\u2019s desk.\n\nHouse Democrats are aiming to finalize all the funding measures at once, waiting for all the bills grouped into minibus packages to be agreed upon before sending them to the White House. That strategy would increase the odds of a complete government shutdown instead of a partial one if no overall agreement is reached on spending legislation.\n\nWhen the previous partial shutdown began, five of the 12 annual bills had already been signed into law, meaning several federal agencies, including the Defense Department, were unaffected.\n\n\u201cI think the longer you delay, the more political things become, obviously, if we move into the election year itself,\u201d said Cole. \u201cSo my hope is we can get this all done, if not by Thanksgiving, then certainly by the end of the calendar year.\u201d\n\nDespite those challenges, some lawmakers are hopeful that appropriators will be able to come together and reach a deal.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Cubs fan,\u201d joked Illinois Rep.
