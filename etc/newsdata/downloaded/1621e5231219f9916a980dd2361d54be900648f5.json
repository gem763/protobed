That inquiry follows after a whistleblower complaint was made public claiming that over half a dozen individuals knowledgeable about the call between Mr Trump and Mr Zelensky had expressed concerns.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Mr Giuliani had sat down for numerous cable news interviews over the weekend, and had openly discussed the case before on live television \u2014 including at least one instance in which he confirmed that he had pushed for an investigation into Mr Biden on the president's behalf.\n\nIt was also reported on Monday afternoon by the New York Times that the president had pressed the prime minister of Australia in a recent phone call to help attorney general William Barr \u2014 who was named by Mr Trump in the 25 July phone call as well \u2014 to gather information that he hopes will help him to discredit the Mueller investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and potential obstruction by the president in the ensuing investigation.\n\nAs things stand, House Democrats have more than enough members saying they support an impeachment inquiry to pass the measure there, once articles are introduced to the full House, and assuming the 223 members who say they support an inquiry also support actual impeachment. That is a big jump in support in the House since just two weeks ago, and falls in line with public support for the issue, which has been shown in numerous polls to be increasing.\n\nShould the House vote to impeach the president, the measure would then be taken to the Senate, where 69 senators would need to approve the measure in order to remove the president from his office. As things stand, that appears to be an unlikely scenario, as it would require more than 20 Republicans for it to pass.\n\nBut, the measure would at least be given a vote, according to Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate who generally has control of what measures go up for a vote.\n\nDuring an interview with CNBC, Mr McConnell said he would be forced to bring the measure up for a vote: \"I would have no choice but to take it up. How long you are on it is a different matter, but I would have no choice but to take it up based on a Senate rule on impeachment.\"", "description": "US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took part in a phone call between\u00a0Donald Trump and Ukraine\u00a0President Volodymyr Zelensky, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0has reported.
