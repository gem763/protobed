Not in GDP, size of her armed forces or the \u201csoft power\u201d of cultural influence. Those have been on the slide, relative to other great powers, since about 1870. No, we\u2019re talking here about the simple dignities of diplomacy and plain old-fashioned good manners. Smooth and harmonious international relations with friends and allies.\n\nThese are the things the British used to be rather accomplished at. Not so much these days, not now that we have this clucking clown running the country, and his Brexiteers running amok in Brussels.\n\nFor example, we read about another cunning plan from the fecund mind of Dominic Cummings to thwart the European Union Withdrawal No6 Act. This would involve sending the required letter applying for an Article 50 extension to Brussels, but also tucking into the vellum envelope another letter saying we don\u2019t really mean it. Smart, no? That\u2019ll show \u2018em.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIt\u2019s illegal anyway, but neither Cummings nor Johnson are lawyers, so what do you expect? If they bothered to listen to Radio 4\u2019s Today programme they\u2019d have heard Lord Sumption explain as much, in forensic detail. But they just don\u2019t want to hear anything on the BBC or elsewhere that contradicts their world view \u2013 Trumpstyle. The play pen in Downing Street is hermetically sealed to reason.\n\nPresumably when he attends the EU summit on 17 October, Boris Johnson will need to resort to the old childish prank of shouting \u201cNot!\u201d after every sentence he utters about the UK\u2019s legally mandated position on an Article 50 delay. I\u2019m sure Chancellor Merkel will get the message.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. \u2018Brexit is like...\u2019 The Top 20 Twitter analogies Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Saint Boris of Uxbridge. Ironic that despite all his past scrapes only now, as prime minister, does the old rascal end up in chokey.\n\nLanguishing during a four-week stretch in a cell in HMP Belmarsh he will, perhaps by tapping out instructions with a tin mug on the water pipes, direct his administration and his general election campaign. I don\u2019t suppose he\u2019ll get many visitors.\n\nDominic, in the cell next door, will no doubt have another plan ready to spring the pair. Prisoners of war, hunted down by the liberal establishment. Boris Johnson would be the first Conservative and Unionist Party leader to campaign whilst on the run! Die in a ditch indeed.\n\nThat might be fanciful, but silliness and rudeness have firmly entered mainstream politics.\n\nOnly a few months ago we had the shaming spectacle of Nigel Farage, Ann Widdecombe, Annunziata Rees-Mogg and the other Brexit Party fruitcakes turning their back on the EU anthem, treating both the Ode to Joy and the joy of the young string quartet performing it with equal contempt. Maybe next time they\u2019ll go \u201cfull moon\u201d and show some real British cheek to the jackbooted Gauleiters of Brussels.\n\nNo doubt they will also be assisting Johnson in doing their best to disrupt the workings of the EU, setting off fire alarms, blockading the staff canteen, trying to expel Malta, that sort of thing.\n\nIt is as if we had PG Wodehouse in charge of the UK.\n\nAnd it\u2019s all very odd considering that the French will be happy to grant an Article 50 extension, but only on the condition that it that creates time for a referendum or, more to the point, a general election to sort Brexit out: Which is precisely what our prime minister so fervently wants.\n\nFor once, the EU would be helping the British solve their internal problems. Which is nice of them, considering how rude we\u2019re being.", "description": "Do you sometimes wonder how low Britain\u2019s stock can fall?
