South Korea's Kospi\n\nwas a touch weaker after disappointing trade data, while\n\nJapan's Nikkei was closed for a holiday. That left MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares\n\noutside Japan up 0.5% at 511.3 points. It is up\n\n3.4% so far in September.\n\nThe E-mini futures for U.S. S&P 500 climbed 0.5%\n\nwhile Dow minis were up 0.4%.\n\nThe gains come after the U.S. Trade Representative's office\n\nissued a brief statement characterising the two days of talks\n\nwith China as \"productive.\" It added that a principal-level\n\ntrade meeting in Washington would take place in October, as\n\npreviously planned. China's Commerce Ministry, in a brief statement, described\n\nthe talks as \"constructive\", and said they had also had a good\n\ndiscussion on \"detailed arrangements\" for the high-level talks\n\nin October.\n\nAdditionally, the United States removed tariffs from more\n\nthan 400 Chinese products in response to requests from U.S.\n\ncompanies.\n\n\"The two nations have continued to hold constructive talks.\n\nThat's helped the sentiment but the markets still remain\n\nunconvinced,\" said Rodrigo Catril, senior forex strategist at\n\nNational Australia Bank in Sydney.\n\nInvestors were still a bit jittery as news broke on Friday\n\nthat Chinese officials unexpectedly cancelled a visit to U.S.\n\nfarms next week following their two days of negotiations in\n\nWashington. That led to losses in Wall Street on Friday with the Dow\n\nclosing 0.6% lower, the S&P500 0.5% down and Nasdaq\n\noff 0.8%.\n\n\"Trade tensions are likely to wax and wane ahead of\n\nU.S.-China October negotiations,\" Citi analyst Cesar Rojas said\n\nin a note.\n\n\"Despite recent signs of a moderation in the pace of trade\n\ntensions escalation ahead of the October face-to-face\n\nnegotiations, we continue expect U.S.-China trade tensions to\n\ncontinue.\"\n\nLater in the day, September manufacturing activity surveys\n\nare due from the United States and European Union which will be\n\nclosely watched for any signs of a rebound.\n\nAction in currency markets was muted.\n\nThe dollar gained 0.1% against the safe haven Japanese yen\n\nto 107.69 after easing 0.5% last week. The risk-sensitive\n\nAustralian dollar AUD=D3 was up 0.1% at $0.6768.\n\nThe euro EUR=D3 was mostly flat as was the British pound\n\n. That left the dollar index flat at 98.508.\n\nIn commodities, Brent crude futures jumped 1.2%, or\n\n75 cents, to $65.03 a barrel, while U.S. crude futures\n\nescalated 1.14%, or 66 cents, to $58.75 a barrel. O/R\n\nThe Pentagon has ordered additional troops to be deployed in\n\nthe Gulf region to strengthen Saudi Arabia's air and missile\n\ndefences following an attack on Saudi oil facilities.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday the\n\nadditional troops are for \"deterrence and defence\" and\n\nWashington aimed to avoid war with Iran.\n\nWith markets calmer since the Sept. 14 attacks on Saudi\n\nArabian refineries, gold pulled back slightly.
