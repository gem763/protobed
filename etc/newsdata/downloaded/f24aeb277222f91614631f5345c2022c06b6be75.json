Authorities expanded evacuation orders over the weekend, clearing out parts of Santa Rosa, which was devastated by a wildfire two years ago.\n\nThe blaze grew by almost 4,000 acres overnight into Sunday to 30,000 acres (47 square miles) and has destroyed almost 80 buildings.\n\nPowerful winds and gusts of up to 90mph on Sunday are making the fire even more difficult to deal with, leading to \u201cerratic fire behaviour\u201d and sending embers travelling for miles, authorities warned.\n\nThe National Weather Service sad the fire was \u201cpotentially a historic event given the strength and duration of the winds\u201d.\n\nUtility firm Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) has been shutting down parts of the power network over fears that gusts could knock down power lines and trigger more fires. It has left 2.3 million people across 38 counties without power.\n\nThe Sonoma County sheriff pleaded with residents in the evacuation zone to get out immediately, citing the 24 lives lost when a wildfire swept through the region two years ago.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m seeing people reporting that they\u2019re going to stay and fight this fire,\u201d Mark Essick said. \u201cYou cannot fight this. Please evacuate.\u201d\n\nThe Healdsburg area lost one of its historic attractions to the flames Sunday when embers carried by the winds sparked a blaze that engulfed the Soda Rock Winery whose buildings included a general store and post office founded in 1869. The winery was about 10 miles outside the town of Healdsburg.\n\nEvacuations also hit inmates at the North County Detention Facility in Santa Rosa and about 100 Sutter Santa Rosa Regional Hospital patients.\n\nPG&E is shutting off parts of the power network to try to stop the fire from spreading More\n\nWhat sparked the current fires is unknown, but PG&E said a 230,000-volt transmission line near Geyserville malfunctioned minutes before that blaze erupted on Wednesday night.\n\nThe possible link between the wine country fire and a PG&E transmission line contained grim parallels to last year when most of the town of Paradise burned, killing 85 people in the deadliest US blaze in a century. State officials concluded a PG&E transmission line sparked that fire.\n\nAnother fire north of Los Angeles is now 55 per cent contained after it destroyed 18 structures. Nearly all the 50,000 Santa Clarita residents ordered to evacuate are now allowed back home after Santa Ana winds began to ease.\n\nAn air tanker drops fire retardant in the valley below in Healdsburg, California, on 26 October 2019 (AFP/Getty) More\n\nMarcos Briano returned to his neighbourhood on Saturday to find destroyed homes on his street. The 71-year-old said: \u201cI\u2019m thankful that nothing happened to my house, but I feel bad for my neighbours.\u201d\n\nSheriff\u2019s officials said human remains were found within the wide burn area, but it is unclear if the death is connected to the blaze.\n\nAgencies contributed to this report", "description": "More than 180,000 people have been forced to flee their homes after \u201chistoric\u201d winds whipped up a wildfire in northern California\u2019s wine country and forced the state\u2019s largest utility company to cut electricity for millions to prevent more fires.It's one of the biggest evacuations in Sonoma County", "authors": ["Dave Maclean"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/F0Pf4GhJSjkh87Wr1HsUZA--~B/aD0zNTA7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/ef35ccd2334aaf16b483f51a844cd32f", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
