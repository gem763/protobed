They said to fail on that was sad, but to make America\u2019s troops then pick up the slack by cutting their budgets was unconscionable.\n\nMr. Trump also defended Homeland Security\u2019s decision to siphon money from emergency response and other duties and use it to pay for detaining illegal immigrants awaiting deportation, and to speed up hearings of border cases.\n\n\u201cWe need help on the border,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
