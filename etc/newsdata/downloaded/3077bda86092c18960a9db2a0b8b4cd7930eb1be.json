The words he associated himself with \u2014 \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong\u201d \u2014 would seem uncontroversial. Who doesn\u2019t hope for the best for plucky demonstrators trying to advance democracy against an overweening imperial dictatorship?\n\nMorey, though, failed to adequately account for the feelings of the dictatorship. \u201cI was merely voicing one thought,\u201d he said in a groveling tweet after deleting his original offending one, \u201cbased on one interpretation, of one complicated event. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cother perspectives\u201d are those of people supporting a \u00adregime that is determined to crush Hong Kong under foot, maintain a one-party state that stifles all internal dissent, brutally repress Uighur Muslims, grab the South China Sea, build up its military with an eye to a future confrontation with the United States and rewrite the rules of the international order to its liking.\n\nBut who\u2019s to judge?\n\nIn its own lickspittle statement, the NBA said that Morley\u2019s views \u201chave deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.\u201d It appears that the Chinese-language version was even more extravagantly craven, saying that the league is \u00ad\u201cextremely disappointed\u201d in the GM\u2019s \u201cinappropriate\u201d tweet that \u201cseverely hurt the feelings of Chinese fans.\u201d\n\nIf you follow the NBA and missed the part where Red China stole the league\u2019s soul, it\u2019s only because you haven\u2019t paid enough attention to the international business. China is a huge and growing market for the NBA. When Chinese sponsors and partners of the Rockets began to pull out, the team and the league buckled.\n\nIt\u2019s a matter of filthy lucre, pure and simple. In retrospect, all the old Soviet Union would have needed to distort corporate America for its purposes was a large and lucrative market. Too committed to communism, Moscow never managed to create one. Via its hybrid system of semi-capitalism wedded to a repressive one-party state, Beijing did. The resulting riches and potential customers allow it to yank the chain of an array of American businesses, including the NBA.\n\nsee also NBA commish backs Rockets GM's right to free expression NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said Monday that the league supports...\n\nThe joke of it is that here at home, the league flaunts its woke social conscience.\n\nThe NBA used the leverage of its All-Star Game coming to Charlotte to force changes to a North Carolina bathroom bill, in the name of \u201cequality.\u201d\n\nOne would think that re-education camps for a million Uighurs \u2014 to pick just one of China\u2019s human rights abuses \u2014 are much worse than any choice North Carolina makes about its restrooms.\n\nEven if all that the league cares about is LGBTQ issues, it should be repelled by Communist China\u2019s policies, which run counter to everything that the NBA purports to stand for.\n\nThis episode exposes the league\u2019s gutless hypocrisy. So long as social activism is costless \u2014 or enhances its reputation among the right people in the United States \u2014 the NBA is all about its values. But as soon as there is any price, the league is willing to \u00adsalute smartly at the dictates of one of the most cynical, self-interested regimes on Earth.\n\nOf course, any profit-generating enterprise is going to care about its bottom line most of all. That shouldn\u2019t efface all sense of decency and self-respect, though. James Harden, the Houston Rockets star, has grown very rich and famous playing an American game in an American league. His reaction to Morey\u2019s tweet was unequivocal: \u201cWe apologize.\u201d\n\nHe thus neatly encapsulated the willingness of a segment of the American business elite to express a kind of national loyalty to a nation that isn\u2019t its own.\n\nRich Lowry is a editor of National Review and author of the forthcoming book \u201cThe Case for Nationalism: How It Made Us Powerful, United and Free.\u201d Twitter: @RichLowry", "description": "The National Basketball Association disgraced itself kowtowing to the Beijing regime after the general manager of the Houston Rockets, Daryl Morey, tweeted his support for Hong Kong protesters.", "authors": ["Rich Lowry", "October"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/morey-nba-china.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
