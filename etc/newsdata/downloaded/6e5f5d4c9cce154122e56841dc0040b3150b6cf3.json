People is reporting the two are no longer dating after spending a month together. \u201cMiley and Kaitlyn broke up,\u201d a source told the outlet. \u201cThey\u2019re still friends.\u201d\n\nThe source stressed that the two really haven't given up their friendship. \u201cThey\u2019ve been friends forever and were there for each other when they were both getting separated, but they\u2019re just not in a romantic relationship anymore.\u201d\n\nCyrus and Carter are both recently out of marriages: Cyrus and her husband Liam Hemsworth announced their separation last month, right as photos came out of Carter and Cyrus kissing on a vacation in Italy together. (Cyrus and Hemsworth had reportedly privately been on a break for months.) Carter and her husband Brody Jenner announced theirs at the beginning of August.\n\nCyrus denied cheating on Hemsworth during their marriage on Twitter, debunking any rumors there was an overlap between her and Carter's romance and her and Hemsworth's. She wrote:\n\nThe truth is, once Liam & I reconciled,I meant it, & I was committed. There are NO secrets to uncover here. I\u2019ve learned from every experience in my life. I\u2019m not perfect, I don\u2019t want to be, it\u2019s boring. I\u2019ve grown up in front of you, but the bottom line is, I HAVE GROWN UP. I can admit to a lot of things but I refuse to admit that my marriage ended because of cheating. Liam and I have been together for a decade. I\u2019ve said it before & it remains true, I love Liam and always will. BUT at this point I had to make a healthy decision for myself to leave a previous life behind. I am the healthiest and happiest I have been in a long time. You can say I am a twerking, pot smoking , foul mouthed hillbilly but I am not a liar. I am proud to say, I am simply in a different place from where i was when I was a younger.\n\nCarter and Cyrus, in their month together, were reported to have moved into the same LA home. They had public dates in New York City and Los Angeles, where they were affectionate in front of photographers.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "The two remain friends though.", "authors": ["Alyssa Bailey"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7C.4wWmF5QUpsGCayNxz7A--~B/aD05ODg7dz0xOTY5O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/marie_claire_447/85c7664c7c094a33a553cb814b81a85b", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
