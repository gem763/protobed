Kennedy airport.\n\nIran\u2019s U.N. mission spokesman Alireza Miryousefi said Iran\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Majid Takht Ravanchi was being treated for cancer in a hospital not far away in Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side neighbourhood. Zarif is in New York for the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations.\n\n\u201cIran has wrongfully detained several U.S. citizens for years, to the pain of their families and friends they cannot freely visit,\u201d the State Department spokesperson said. \u201cWe have relayed to the Iranian mission that the travel request will be granted if Iran releases a U.S. citizen.\u201d\n\nThe United States and Iran are at odds over a host of issues, including the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, U.S. accusations - denied by Tehran - that Iran attacked two Saudi oil facilities on Sept. 14 and Iran\u2019s detention of U.S. citizens on what the United States regards as spurious grounds.\n\nBrian Hook, the State Department\u2019s special representative for Iran, on Monday said that if Iran wanted to show good faith, it should release the U.S. citizens it has detained, including Xiyue Wang, a U.S. citizen and Princeton University graduate student who was detained in Iran in 2016.\n\nAt a news conference in New York on Thursday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said Tehran was open to talking about prisoner swaps but that the ball was in Washington\u2019s court after Iran\u2019s release of a Lebanese man with U.S. permanent residency in June.\n\nThe United States deported an Iranian woman who pleaded guilty to exporting restricted U.S. technology to Iran on Tuesday. During a visit to New York in April, Zarif specifically mentioned the woman\u2019s case when talking about possible prisoner swaps.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday declined to discuss the possibility of a U.S.-Iranian prisoner swap after the woman\u2019s deportation.", "description": "The United States rejected a request by Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif to visit Iran's United Nations ambassador in a New York hospital where he is being treated for cancer, the U.S. State Department and Iranian U.N. mission said on Friday.", "authors": ["Humeyra Pamuk", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
