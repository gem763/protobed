Natalist's first offering is a subscription bundle for women who are seeking to get pregnant.\n\nThe idea came out of Tecco's experiences trying to get pregnant. It was important to Tecco and her team that these products be easy to use, backed by science, and stigma-free, she said.\n\nStartups like Natalist that ship health products right to your door have become a big business. But in bypassing prescription drugs and focusing on women, Natalist is taking a fresh new approach.\n\nClick here for more BI Prime stories.\n\nWhile trying to get pregnant, Halle Tecco found herself \"running around\" the drugstore far too often.\n\nEverything she needed was spread across different aisles. And when she brought the products home, they were too clunky for a bathroom cabinet, lacking the streamlined design of beauty products she loved and bought.\n\nAs a Harvard Business School graduate and cofounder and former CEO of the venture-capital firm Rock Health, Tecco was also the rare consumer well-equipped to do something about it.\n\nSo she started a new company, Natalist, aimed at bringing an easy-to-use, science-backed, stigma-free approach to women's health. Natalist's first product offering is a \"Get Pregnant\" bundle delivering products like prenatal vitamins and ovulation tests right to a customer's door. The company, which is Tecco's first stint in the role of startup CEO, has raised $5 million in funding from investors like Rock Health and angel investors like Stitch Fix founder and CEO Katrina Lake and Kleiner Perkins's John Doerr.\n\nWhen it comes to fertility, Tecco's experience taught her there's \"a lot of misinformation, a lot of secrecy and shame,\" she said. The idea is \"to help people that are just starting to try and understand that the journey can look a million different ways.\" Tecco's son was born in 2016.\n\nNatalist's product offerings were designed to be easy to use and stigma-free. Natalist The Get Pregnant bundle is available either as a subscription, at $81 a month, or as a one-time $90 purchase. Products in the bundle, which were custom developed for Natalist, from the contents to the box and wrapper, are also available on their own. The set includes:\n\nPrenatal vitamins: a one-month supply of a prenatal multivitamin and a one-month supply of an omega DHA supplement\n\na one-month supply of a prenatal multivitamin and a one-month supply of an omega DHA supplement Ovulation tests (7): used to time sexual activity and improve chances of conceiving\n\nused to time sexual activity and improve chances of conceiving Pregnancy tests (3): these early-result tests, which can be used five days before an expected period, can give women speedy answers, according to Natalist\n\nthese early-result tests, which can be used five days before an expected period, can give women speedy answers, according to Natalist \"Conception 101\" book: a 64-page, doctor- and scientist-written guide, steering customers through everything from \"concept to conception,\" including tips and tools for how to get pregnant\n\nNatalist's kits for women feature prenatal vitamins, ovulation tests, pregnancy tests, and a guide to \"Conception 101.\" Natalist\n\nThe offerings came out of a survey that Natalist did of about 1,200 women to look at their experiences and which products were most helpful to them.\n\nThe startup's chief medical adviser, Dr. Nazaneen Homaifar, and chief scientific officer, Elizabeth Kane, who holds a doctorate in neuroscience from Harvard, also reviewed the scientific evidence in support, narrowing it down to \"what we consider the essentials,\" Tecco said.\n\n\"That's the market we're going after: helping people get pregnant naturally and in a healthy way,\" she said.\n\nIn line with that, a section of Natalist's website says the company doesn't sell things like crystals and fertility tea because it's \"committed to not wasting your time or money with products that failed science class.\"\n\nThe Get Pregnant bundle is Natalist's flagship offering, but a natural next step for the company would be products that boost male fertility, according to Tecco.\n\nWhy Natalist isn't using digital doctor consults\n\nDelivery services that ship healthcare products right to your door are a red-hot trend lately, with investors pouring upward of $660 million into the space. It's something Tecco is well aware of, having invested in companies like the at-home lab-test startup EverlyWell. (EverlyWell co-founder and CEO Julia Cheek is an angel investor in Natalist.)\n\nBut where many new startups are dispensing prescription medications after digital consultations with medical professionals, Natalist is taking a fresh approach by sidestepping that altogether. The startup's focus on women also represents a change in a field where venture-capital funding has largely gone to companies with a focus on male fertility.\n\nRead more: There's a boom in VC funding for fertility startups. But female founders say they still have a hard time getting men to invest.\n\nNatalist's chief medical adviser, Dr. Nazaneen Homaifar; founder and CEO, Halle Tecco; and chief scientific officer, Elizabeth Kane. Natalist\n\nCustomers don't need to meet with a doctor to subscribe to Natalist, though they can, of course, contact the startup with questions. And Natalist may not ever do the digital doctor consults known as telemedicine, Tecco said, preferring to instead partner with another startup if necessary.\n\nThat wasn't always the case. Early on, Tecco took a look at the fertility prescription market, including two of the most commonly used medications.\n\nBut ultimately, that idea was at odds with the value she puts on improving the healthcare system in concert with physicians and the medical system. Women struggling with fertility need to have a long-term relationship with a doctor so the doctor can treat the patient in a holistic way, she said.\n\n\"To be honest, there's a reason I didn't pursue that direction,\" she said, adding, \"I ethically do not feel like building a, what I call a 'digital pill mill,' is good for the healthcare system.\"\n\n\"I did look into it,\" she added, \"and I'm sure there is a demand for it, but I just don't feel that it's the right thing.\"\n\nThis story was first published August 27.
