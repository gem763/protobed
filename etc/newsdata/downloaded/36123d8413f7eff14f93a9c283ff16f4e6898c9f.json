LeBron James has used social media to bring attention to the experiences of teenagers and young adults, who have highlighted topics such as anti-bullying and social justice.\n\nStephen Curry has worked with the Nothing But Nets organization, traveling to Tanzania in 2013 to hang bed nets in mud huts for residents to help protect them against diseases like malaria and typhoid fever.\n\nJordan previously expressed his belief that the NBA and its players should be able to \"exercise their right to free speech\" in September 2017. The former Chicago Bulls superstar remains an icon in the sports world through his Air Jordan brand 16 years after retiring from the NBA.", "description": "Charlotte Hornets owner  Michael Jordan  is in favor of athletes using their platform to speak out on social issues...", "authors": ["Adam Wells"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/833/877/hi-res-5c447e64694336928e61f9d55eca13fb_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
