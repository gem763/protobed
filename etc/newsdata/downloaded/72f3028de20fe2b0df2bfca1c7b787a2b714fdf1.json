What\u2019s In (and Not In) Step One of the U.S.-China Trade Deal\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Want to receive this post in your inbox every day? Sign up for the Terms of Trade newsletter, and follow Bloomberg Economics on Twitter for more.\n\nChinese officials confirmed over the weekend that the U.S. and China are close to finalizing the \u201cphase one\u201d deal Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping are expected to sign on the sidelines of a Nov. 16-17 meeting in Chile of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation. So it\u2019s a good time to review what\u2019s in the deal \u2014 and what\u2019s not.What\u2019s In:\n\nA pause in the tariff escalation, but not an end of them. Trump agreed to forego an Oct. 15 increase to 30% from 25% in the tariffs collected on some $250 billion in imports from China. But the 25% tariffs haven\u2019t gone away. And neither has the 15% tariff on a further $110 billion in goods that took effect Sept. 1, nor the threat that another $160 billion in goods will be hit Dec. 15. There is an expectation the Dec. 15 tariffs, which would hit popular consumer items like smartphones and toys, won\u2019t take effect. But a lot of tariffs remain in place.\n\nConcessions on intellectual property. From the beginning, the administration\u2019s big target in its \u201cSection 301\u201d fight against China has been forcing an end to what the U.S. sees as a systematic and state-backed Chinese theft of American intellectual property. Included in the deal being finalized are commitments by China. But they are largely actions China has taken already. It passed new IP and foreign investment laws earlier this year that address the issue. It has also already set up new IP courts to prosecute cases. As always with China, the key is whether authorities enforce the laws.\n\nCurrency commitments. As members of the Group of 20 both the U.S. and China have agreed not to manipulate currency markets for economic advantage. Now they will have a bilateral commitment to do so that may lead to the U.S. removing the \u201ccurrency manipulator\u201d label it slapped on China in August.\n\nLots of soybeans and pork, and some other Chinese farm concessions. China has already resumed purchases of soybeans and begun buying American pork in large quantities. Trump has set doubling purchases as a goal. But the indications are that initially China will simply be buying at levels seen before the trade war started. Even that is politically convenient for both the U.S. and China. Trump wants to help an important political constituency \u2014 farmers. Meanwhile, a devastating disease has led to mass deaths of pigs in China and a surge in the price of pork that has leaders in Beijing concerned.\n\nOther purchases, possibly commitments to buy more American commercial aircraft and .\n\nA dispute resolution mechanism. What the U.S. once insisted would be a rigorous enforcement mechanism to make sure China lives up to its promises seems to have become a dispute mechanism much like those in most trade agreements. Just how effective it will be is unclear.\n\nThings China has announced already, including the lifting of equity caps on foreign ownership of financial services firms.\n\nWhat\u2019s Not:\n\nAn end to China\u2019s economic model as we know it. A draft agreement being batted around when talks broke down in May included commitments for greater transparency on China\u2019s vast web of industrial subsidies. Also meant to be addressed was the role of state-owned enterprises and other command economy initiatives like \u201cMade in China 2025,\u201d Xi\u2019s plan to rule the world in areas like artificial intelligence and electric cars. None of that is addressed in \u201cphase one.\u201d If anything the trade wars have actually caused China to double down on state programs to boost homegrown technologies.\n\nAny breaks for Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant that\u2019s been put on a U.S. blacklist that restricts its ability to work with American suppliers. White House officials have said those decisions are on a separate track.\n\nA plan for a final peace. The Trump administration is eager to push the idea that the initial phase will be followed by others. But the expectations that will happen are low. While that peace remains at bay the reality is lots of tariffs will remain in place, leading to higher costs for businesses and consumers, and extending the uncertainty that has been a damper on the global economy all year.\n\nCharting the Trade War\n\nThe escalation of U.S.-China tensions this year continued to leave a mark on international trade during the third quarter. While volumes in the CPB World Trade Monitor increased in August, when both countries announced new tariffs, three-month underlying momentum showed further weakness. There was a 0.5% decline from the previous period, and a 1.5% drop compared with a year earlier.\n\nToday\u2019s Must Reads\n\nSpurning Thailand | Trump is suspending some trade preferences for Thailand over concerns about worker rights, a move the nation says will affect only a small proportion of its exports.\n\nHeavy metal | Vietnam slapped five-year tariffs on Chinese and South Korean color-coated steel products after domestic producers cited unfair pricing from overseas competitors.\n\nAnother Brexit delay | The European Union agreed to grant the U.K. a three-month Brexit delay to Jan. 31, removing the risk of a damaging no-deal split on Thursday.\n\nEconomic gateway | Thousands of Romanian political prisoners died while building a canal from the Danube River to the Black Sea \u2014 now it may help bring prosperity to one of the EU\u2019s poorest members.\n\nU.S. market access | South African exports to the U.S. are at risk pending a review in Washington of the country\u2019s eligibility for a preferential-trade program.\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\nPhase one hopes | Positive signals from U.S.-China trade talks don\u2019t mean the yuan is a one-way bet up.\n\nAsia warning | Thailand is the latest target of U.S. trade warfare, but may not be the last in Southeast Asia.\n\nComing Up\n\nNov. 1: South Korea trade balance\n\nLike Terms of Trade?\n\nDon\u2019t keep it to yourself.
