Dorian has steadily maintained maximum sustained winds of 115 mph on Wednesday, making it a Category 2 storm. After bringing intensely destructive winds and deadly flooding to the Bahamas, the storm seems to have spared Florida from a worst-case scenario.\n\n\"We got lucky in Florida, very very lucky indeed,\" President Trump said of Dorian's most recent track.\n\nDorian is roughly 150 miles south of Charleston, S.C., moving at 8 mph, the NHC said in its 5 p.m. ET update. The storm is predicted to turn toward the north-northeast \u2014 and around the same time, it's expected to close some of the distance to the shore. Dorian's core is forecast to move parallel to the Florida and Georgia coasts through Wednesday night, the NHC says.\n\nYouTube\n\nDorian is blamed for at least seven deaths in the Bahamas, but that toll is still being tallied because of the scale of the severe destruction wreaked there by a massive storm surge and strong winds.\n\nThe storm is now bringing heavy rain and gusty winds to the U.S. southeast coast. A precarious 24-hour period will begin early Thursday, when the hurricane's center is forecast to move near or over the coast of South Carolina and North Carolina Thursday through Friday morning.\n\nA storm surge warning is in effect for a huge area of the coastline, from north of Port Canaveral, Fla., through Georgia and South Carolina up to through the Neuse and Pamlico rivers in North Carolina. The NHC says that in addition to the storm surge, areas along the coastal Carolinas could see an estimated 15 inches of rainfall.\n\nDuring an afternoon storm briefing from the White House, Trump said sections of the Bahamas were hit \"like few people have seen before.\"\n\nHe also said the Bahamian government has requested assistance and that the U.S. is helping in a \"humanitarian way\" including sending helicopters and personnel to impacted areas. On Dorian's impact on this country, the president says the U.S. is \"lucky\" so far to not be directly in the storm's path.\n\n\"We certainly got lucky in Florida, now if we can get lucky in Georgia, if you look at South Carolina, North Carolina, but it could even extend beyond that. We're talking about Virginia, hard to believe,\" the president said.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nHe called Dorian \"very erratic\" and said the storm has built up \"tremendous water and water supply.\"\n\nDuring the same briefing, acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan underscored the dangers Dorian presents, particularly that the coasts of North and South Carolina could be hit by a \"triple treat.\"\n\n\"It's that triple threat of hurricane force winds, certainly tropical-storm force, as well as storm surge of 4 to 7 feet and then a significant rain event up to 10 inches or more in parts of the Carolinas,\" McAleenan said.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption NOAA/NWS, Esri, HERE, Garmin, Earthstar Geographics NOAA/NWS, Esri, HERE, Garmin, Earthstar Geographics\n\nMcAleenan said federal officials are coordinating with state and local officials ahead of the storm to pre-position assets for a quicker response once the storm passes.\n\nDangerous winds are also threatening a large area: Dorian is now sending hurricane-force winds outward up to 70 miles from its center; its tropical-storm-force winds extend for up to 195 miles.\n\nIn a late-morning briefing, National Hurricane Center Director Ken Graham warned residents that roughly 90% of deaths in these storms are caused by water.\n\n\"The wind speed in the center, well that's one thing, but it's about the size, its about the storm surge and its about all that rainfall,\" Graham said. \"Water is the leading cause of fatalities in these tropical systems, so listen to those local officials.\"\n\nIn the Bahamas, the response to the terrible damage includes rescue efforts from the U.S. Coast Guard and the British navy. The push to get relief supplies to the area is also drawing on aid groups. As of Wednesday morning, the international airport in Freeport was still flooded.\n\n\"People are getting desperate, because their roofs are ripped off and their food supplies got damaged or thrown all over the place\" in the chain's Abaco islands, NPR's Jason Beaubien reports from Nassau.\n\nJos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, the renowned chef and philanthropist, rode out Dorian at the Atlantis resort in the Bahamas in anticipation of feeding residents impacted by the storm.\n\n\"If there's no kitchen initially we will try to ... bring in the food daily, well, through a boat or a helicopter,\" Andr\u00e9s told NPR's Steve Inskeep on Wednesday's Morning Edition.\n\nHe added that he had gotten an assist in food preparation from guests at the resort, where Andr\u00e9s has a restaurant.\n\n\"They began coming, entire families, coming to help us make sandwiches,\" Andr\u00e9s says. \"When you see things like this it's really unbelievable.\"\n\nThe Bahamian government was finally able to discontinue all tropical storm warnings early Wednesday \u2014 three days after Dorian hit the island chain as a Category 5 storm and nearly a week after the Bahamas issued its first hurricane alert last Thursday morning.\n\n\"All clear!\" the emergency agency announced on Wednesday. But it also warned that residents should still be on their guard against a number of possible threats, from downed power lines and trees to severe flooding and the potential for tornadoes.\n\nDorian has defied numerous forecasts, including initial predictions that it would buzz across Florida's central east coast. Instead, its center has refused to make landfall on the U.S. And after booming into a Category 5 storm with gusts far above 200 mph over the weekend, Dorian has lost some strength \u2014 but forecasters warn it can still cause more damage.\n\n\"Some weakening is expected during the next couple of days, and Dorian is expected to remain a powerful hurricane during the next few days,\" the NHC says. The extended forecast calls for Dorian to skirt the U.S. coast \u2014 and remain a hurricane until it reaches Nova Scotia this weekend.\n\nWhile Florida may have been spared the worst of what Dorian threatened, there are some collateral impacts, such as the washing onshore of illicit drug shipments. So far, authorities say, they have found 26 packaged kilos of cocaine on Florida's shores.\n\nIn Virginia, the U.S. Navy ordered its Hampton Roads-based aircraft and ships to leave the area ahead of the storm. Starting Wednesday ships will begin leaving Naval Station Norfolk and Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek and remain at sea until the storm passes.\n\nThe Navy says some planes will be flown to alternative airfields, while others will be secured in hangars.\n\n\"This allows time for our assets to transit safely out of the path of the storm,\" Vice Adm. Andrew Lewis of the U.S. 2nd Fleet said in a statement.\n\nEarlier this week, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam declared a state of emergency ahead of Dorian's anticipated effects on the southeastern part of the state, which could begin to feel the storm's impact by Thursday.\n\nOn South Carolina's coast, people have been ordered to evacuate or take shelter ahead of Dorian's arrival. But as often happens in such cases, not everyone plans to leave. The mandatory evacuation order took effect at noon Tuesday. But late in the afternoon, Myrtle Beach was still fairly crowded, South Carolina Public Radio's Scott Morgan reports.\n\nIn neighboring Georgia, Gov. Brian Kemp has ordered a state of emergency that includes 21 coastal counties. At least six counties are under a mandatory evacuation order.\n\nIn Florida, people who seem to have avoided a direct hit by Dorian are now mounting supply drives to bring aid and relief materials to the Bahamas. A two-day supply drive in West Palm Beach is seeking first-aid kits, flashlights and other materials.\n\nIn Miami's large Bahamian community, churches and the local government are working to send relief supplies to help ease those trapped on Grand Bahama and Abaco.\n\n\"Having lived through similar storms myself in the Bahamas, it's really a harrowing, life-changing experience,\" the Rev. Jonathan Archer of Christ Episcopal Church told member station WLRN. \"We're getting a lot of food, a lot of water, but we certainly need a lot more batteries, flashlights, tarp, rope.\"", "description": "After bringing intensely destructive winds and deadly flooding to the Bahamas, Dorian is \"ambling\" to the north-northwest, according to the National Hurricane Center.", "authors": ["Bill Chappell", "Brakkton Booker", "Richard Gonzales"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/09/04/dorian-satellite_goes16-abi-conus-geocolor-5000x3000_wide-e73e12d8c1ec8237373086592c8d1846e8dee65c.jpg?s=1400"}
