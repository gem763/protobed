Then it was going eight months without a genuine left back.\n\nThis season, there\u2019s another defensive issue facing Pep Guardiola at Manchester City: a shortage of center backs.\n\nWith long-serving captain Vincent Kompany released in the offseason and Aymeric Laporte ruled out for the rest of 2019 because of a knee injury, City was already lacking numbers at center back when John Stones sustained a muscle injury in training this week and could be sidelined until November.\n\nIt has left Guardiola with one fit senior center back - Nicolas Otamendi, a player who looked on his way out of the club after barely featuring last season - just as the fixtures start piling up this season.\n\nGuardiola\u2019s response? Bring it on.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem, it is a challenge,\u201d he said this week about City\u2019s center-back crisis.\n\nSo he\u2019s going to have to be bold and creative.\n\nGuardiola\u2019s first decision was to play defensive midfielder Fernandinho at the heart of the defense for the Champions League group match away to Shakhtar Donetsk on Wednesday. Making his first start of the campaign, Fernandinho - who has been playing as a defender in training this season - slotted in just fine and City kept a clean sheet, winning 3-0.\n\nExpecting Fernandinho, 34, and Otamendi, 31, to play three games in a week-long span might be asking too much, so Guardiola will have other ideas.\n\nLike, maybe, promoting Eric Garcia to the first team. The 18-year-old Spaniard was part of Barcelona\u2019s famed La Masia academy as a kid and was signed by City in 2017, but has yet to play a Premier League match.\n\nOr even Taylor Harwood-Bellis, a 17-year-old academy prospect who hasn\u2019t played a senior match for City.\n\nKyle Walker, a right back, could even move into the center of defense in an emergency, having played in a back three for England and City previously.\n\nWhichever option Guardiola chooses, it\u2019s hardly an ideal situation for a team that plans to go hard at every competition this season - just like the last one, when City won the domestic treble and reached the Champions League quarterfinals. City is also already five points behind Liverpool after five games of its Premier League title defense, which continues at home to Watford on Saturday.\n\n\u201cFootball is not how you handle the good situations,\u201d Guardiola said, \u201cit\u2019s how you handle the bad ones.\u201d\n\nThe City coach joined the club in 2016 and reacted to being bequeathed four full backs all in their 30s, and unable to provide the attacking threat and positional play demanded by Guardiola, by spending more than $150 million on three new ones the following offseason.\n\nIn his second season in charge, Guardiola saw left back Benjamin Mendy seriously injure his knee in September and be ruled out for almost the whole season. His response was to deploy Fabian Delph, a center midfielder, as a left back and City managed to still rack up 100 points in winning the Premier League.\n\nWith Kompany departing, Guardiola wanted to sign Harry Maguire from Leicester but the fee demanded for the England center back was far too high - he ended up joining Manchester United for 80 million pounds ($97 million) - and City went into this season with just three central defenders.\n\nAlready that decision is proving unwise.\n\nHowever, City\u2019s purchase of Spain defensive midfielder Rodri does allow Guardiola to use Fernandinho solely as a defender, similar to when Javier Mascherano dropped into defense for Barcelona during Guardiola\u2019s time as coach there.\n\nFernandinho has the intelligence, leadership and game management to perform as a defender, a position he has expected to play this season. He looked at home there against Shakhtar, sometimes pushing up into midfield with the ball, in a game in which he was made captain.\n\n\u201cOf course he has a lot of experience and personality,\u201d Guardiola said of the Brazilian, \u201cand what he says the people follow him in the locker room.\u201d\n\nA more intriguing option would be Garcia, who is likely to start in the English League Cup against second-tier Preston next week and should get his first start in the Premier League soon. He impressed in his three League Cup outings last season and looks to be a defender very much in the Guardiola mold, with his ball-playing ability making up for his lack of height.\n\nGarcia, who lives at the City\u2019s training complex, is highly regarded having played in all of Spain\u2019s youth teams, most recently for the Under-21s.\n\nCity is fortunate that its schedule, while packed, is not too difficult. After Watford, City plays Preston, Everton, Dinamo Zagreb, Wolverhampton, Crystal Palace, Atalanta, Aston Villa, Southampton and then Atalanta again, before a trip to Anfield to play title rival Liverpool on Nov 10.\n\nStones could be back by then. But Fernandinho or Garcia might easily have made a strong case to stay in the team.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nSteve Douglas is at www.twitter.com/sdouglas80\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "First it was having a quartet of aging full backs unable to deliver on his demands.
