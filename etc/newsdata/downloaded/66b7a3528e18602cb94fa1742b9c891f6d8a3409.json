The show, which just recently unveiled the next series\u2019 line up, will see professional skater Matt Evers work with Steps singer Ian Watkins.\n\nWatkins, also known as H, is said to be the one who proposed the idea to the \u201cDancing on Ice\u201d production team. While there were discussions about it, the production crew embraced the proposal.\n\nA spokesperson for ITV neither confirmed nor denied the speculation. According to the network, the official pairings for the new series will be verified a few weeks before the first episode airs.\n\nIt can be recalled that then-\u201cDancing on Ice\u201d judge Jason Gardiner made headlines last year when he publicly declared his support for a same-sex pairing in the rink. With his support, however, came a warning that there may be logistical challenges for same-sex pairings because of similarities in body type of same-sex skaters.\n\nReferring to the fact that it is very difficult to lift someone near your own height and weight over your head.\n\nH, for his part, remained tight-lipped about the rumors. The openly-gay star did, however, post a selfie with judges Christopher Dean and Jayne Torvill. H then wrote the caption \u201cHappiness,\u201d which has been interpreted by many as a reference to the news.\n\n'Strictly Come Dancing' next?\n\nThe \u201cDancing on Ice\u201d decision foiled the BBC\u2019s plan for \u201cStrictly Come Dancing\u201d to be the first dance reality program to feature a same-sex pair.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news! Click on the topic you interest most. We'll keep you updated with all the news you shouldn't miss. TV Shows\n\nJust a few weeks before, calls for \u201cStrictly\u201d to open up to same-sex pairs reached a feverish pitch.\n\nJudges Shirley Ballas and Craig Revel Horwood have already publicly backed plans to include a same-sex pair in the line up of the show. Original judge Arlene Phillips also agreed with the plan, citing the mainstreaming of same-sex dance couples in dance competitions all throughout the world.\n\nThe BBC also expressed openness at the idea of having same-sex pairing.\n\nIt cites the dance reality series\u2019 track record of inclusivity. The statement also said that the network is proud to feature many LGBT creators and dancers in the show.\n\nThe statement is actually a huge change for the network. The BBC released a statement back in 2017 saying that it wanted to stick with the \u201ctraditional format of mixed-sex couples\u201d in the show.\n\nWhile there has not been same-sex pair in the competition, \u201cStrictly Come Dancing\u201d did feature a same-sex performance in a result show last year. That time, Gorka Marquez and AJ Pritchard danced together during the number.\n\nLGBT contestants in other British reality shows\n\nIt is hardly the first time that a British reality show had LGBT contestants onscreen. Australian drag queen and media personality Courtney Act famously won \u201cCelebrity Big Brother\u201d last year. Rav Bansal of \u201cThe Great British Bake Off\u201d also got praised for publicly coming out, increasing visibility for Sikh members of the LGBT community. Even Nathan Henry confirmed he is gay during his time on the reality series \u201cGeordie Shore.\u201d", "description": "The official pairings for the new series will be verified a few weeks before the first episode airs.", "authors": ["Ramon Sanchez", "Jane Flowers", "Susan B.", "Read More On The Same Topic Ramon Sanchez", "'Strictly Come Dancing' Fans Witness Secret Conversations Caught On Hot Mic", "Day Fiance'", "Deavan", "Jihoon Still Face Some Problems Despite Their Paebaek Ceremony", "'Strictly Come Dancing' Ex-Couple Katya", "Neil Jones Trade Spats After Live Tv Comment"], "top_image": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2019/10/9/os/b_1200x630/dancing-on-ice-likely-one-ups-strictly-come-dancing-in-getting-same-sex-pairing-image-source-bbc-strictly-come-dancingyoutube_2336673.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
