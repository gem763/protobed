Trade agreements: Republicans and Democrats both voiced concerns the U.S. appears to be including language similar to Section 230 in trade agreements, with Energy & Commerce committee ranking member Greg Walden offering particularly pointed criticism.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting blown off on this, and I\u2019m tired of it,\u201d Walden said after referencing a letter he and committee Chairman Frank Pallone sent to United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. \u201cClearly they\u2019re not listening to our committee or us.\u201d\n\n2. Repeal is unlikely: Republicans and Democrats also agreed they don\u2019t want to gut or repeal Section 230, but they warned Reddit CEO Steve Huffman and Google global head of intellectual property policy Katherine Oyama that companies need to step up their online content moderation efforts.\n\n\u201cWe all recognize that content moderation online is lacking in a number of ways and that we all need to address this issue better,\u201d said Rep. Mike Doyle, chairman of the communications subcommittee. \u201cIf not you, who are the platforms and experts in this technology, and you put that on our shoulders, you may see a law that you don\u2019t like very much and that has a lot of unintended consequences for the internet.\u201d\n\nReality check: Despite some agreement among lawmakers that there are problems with online content moderation, there\u2019s a variety of approaches to addressing the issue and immediate action is unlikely.", "description": "Republicans and Democrats found some common ground on what's next for Section 230", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/ayA_7XQhxTY8TI4efd8bFFoDxQk=/0x56:4840x2778/1920x1080/2019/10/17/1571275655129.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
