On August 10, 2019, he died in an apparent jailhouse suicide. For more information, see The Daily Beast's reporting here.\n\nA new accuser has come forward against Jeffrey Epstein, claiming the billionaire pedophile and his alleged madam, British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, sexually assaulted her and her underage sister on different occasions in the 1990s.\n\nThe allegations surfaced Tuesday as part of a defamation suit Virginia Roberts Giuffre filed against Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, a friend and attorney of Epstein\u2019s who helped secure a controversial plea deal for Epstein after he was arrested in 2006 for molesting dozens of minor girls at his Palm Beach mansion.\n\nMaria Farmer, the alleged victim, also claims she witnessed Dershowitz visit Epstein\u2019s Manhattan mansion and head upstairs, where she says underage girls were present.\n\nGiuffre has long claimed Epstein kept her as a \u201csex slave\u201d and loaned her to his famous friends including Prince Andrew. (Both men have vehemently denied this claim.) She filed the lawsuit against Dershowitz in New York federal court, claiming the high-profile defense lawyer \u201cwas also a participant in sex trafficking, including as one of the men to whom Epstein lent out [Giuffre] for sex.\u201d\n\nThe complaint accuses Dershowitz of employing \u201ca desperate barrage of false and increasingly defamatory attacks\u201d on Giuffre after a Miami Herald investigation revealed how Epstein and his lawyers obtained the infamous non-prosecution agreement that essentially resulted in Epstein getting a slap on the wrist for abusing the underage girls. Epstein served 13 months of his 18-month sentence for crimes that could have sent him to prison for life.\n\nDershowitz has recently accused Giuffre and her lawyers of framing him in order to get millions of dollars from Epstein\u2019s only known client, Limited Brands chairman Leslie Wexner. He also accused another Epstein accuser, Sarah Ransome, of fabricating recent claims that she was coerced into sex with Dershowitz. (In response, Dershowitz called Ransome\u2019s accusations \u201cdelusional\u201d and claimed he\u2019d never met her.)\n\nIndeed, Dershowitz challenged his accusers to sue him for defamation.\n\nIn response to the lawsuit, Dershowitz told The Daily Beast on Tuesday: \u201cI welcome it. This lawsuit gives me the opportunity I\u2019ve been looking for to prove Virginia Roberts has committed perjury and will continue to commit perjury in federal court.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am asking the FBI to come to this trial because perjury will be committed in front of a federal judge and in a federal courtroom,\u201d Dershowitz added. \u201cAnd I will prove it is she who is committing perjury.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will prove it from her own mouth as I have documents from her that acknowledges that I was not one of the people that she had sex with,\u201d Dershowitz said.\n\nThe Daily Beast has left messages for attorneys for Maxwell and Epstein, and put in a call for comment from Wexner on Tuesday.\n\nIn the affidavit, Maria Farmer says she was an artist and grad student in New York City in 1995, when she met Epstein and his alleged madam, Maxwell, at an art show. The following summer, she alleges, the pair sexually assaulted Farmer in Ohio\u2014and molested her 15-year-old sister at Epstein\u2019s ranch in New Mexico.\n\nThe duo are accused of sexually assaulting Farmer while she stayed at Wexner\u2019s Ohio mansion. At the time, Epstein had allegedly enlisted Farmer for a special art project at Wexner\u2019s property, where she stayed along with her younger brothers.\n\n\u201c She alleges the pair sexually assaulted her in Ohio\u2014and molested her 15-year-old sister at Epstein\u2019s ranch in New Mexico. \u201d\n\n\u201cEpstein said that if I sold him one of my paintings for half price he would help me with my career,\u201d Farmer stated of their first meeting. \u201cI sold him the painting that night for half price which was approximately $6,000.\u201d\n\nMonths later, Farmer claims in the court filing, Epstein called her and claimed he was looking for an art consultant. But instead, Farmer was hired to become a lookout for the front door of Epstein\u2019s East 71st Street mansion. Her job involved \u201cmanning the front door at his New York mansion and keeping records of people who came to the home,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cDuring the time I was supervising the door at Epstein\u2019s mansion, I witnessed a number of school age girls coming to the home, some of the young girls would be wearing their school uniforms,\u201d Farmer\u2019s affidavit added. Those girls would enter Epstein\u2019s Upper East Side property, then be escorted upstairs, Farmer claimed.\n\n\u201cWhen I asked Maxwell why these young girls were coming over to the house so often she said that the girls were interviewing for modeling positions,\u201d Farmer stated. \u201cAt the time, based on my observations at the home, it did not seem credible to me that these young girls were interviewing for modeling positions.\u201d\n\n\u201c During the time I was supervising the door at Epstein\u2019s mansion, I witnessed a number of school age girls coming to the home, some of the young girls would be wearing their school uniforms... \u201d\n\nDershowitz visited Epstein\u2019s New York residence \u201ca number of times\u201d while Farmer worked for Epstein, she said. \u201cDershowitz was very comfortable at the home and would come in and walk upstairs,\u201d Farmer added. She claims Dershowitz went upstairs at the same time minor girls were present there.\n\nDershowitz denied Farmer\u2019s claims, telling The Daily Beast: \u201cMaria Farmer stopped working for Epstein before I ever met Epstein. It\u2019s a totally perjured affidavit. It\u2019s all totally made up. For her lawyers to submit these obviously perjured affidavits raises serious questions about their role in this case.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Farmer claims her younger sister, who was 15 years old, was abused by Epstein and Maxwell, too.\n\n\u201cMaxwell and Epstein took an interest in my younger sister. Epstein took us to a movie in New York and during the movie he held my younger sister\u2019s hand and was rubbing her in a sexual manner without my knowledge,\u201d Farmer said in her affidavit.\n\nEpstein \u201cthen contacted my mother and said he wants to help put my younger sister through a special school program in Thailand,\u201d Farmer added.\n\nThat summer, Epstein and Maxwell allegedly flew Farmer\u2019s younger sister to Epstein\u2019s ranch in New Mexico, where they molested her on a massage table, the affidavit alleges.\n\nThe duo is accused of touching the girl inappropriately after directing her to remove her clothes and get on a massage table. \u201cIt was not until later in the summer when I called my sister in Thailand where she was studying that I learned what had happened to her at Epstein\u2019s New Mexico ranch,\u201d Farmer stated in the court filing.\n\n\u201c I called the FBI and made the report but to my knowledge, the FBI did not take any action against Epstein or Maxwell. \u201d\n\nWhile Farmer worked on her art project at Wexner\u2019s mansion, she claims, Maxwell and Epstein sexually assaulted her. \u201cThey asked me to come into a bedroom with them and then proceeded to sexually assault me against my will,\u201d Farmer said. \u201cI fled the room and called the sheriff\u2019s office but did not get any response.\u201d\n\nWexner\u2019s security, Farmer said, refused to let her leave the property. \u201cI was held against my will for approximately twelve hours until I was ultimately allowed to leave with my father,\u201d Farmer said. Her father had driven to Ohio from Kentucky to get her.\n\nFarmer claims that when she returned to New York and went to police at the Sixth Precinct for help, officers allegedly told her to contact the FBI to make a report about the supposed Ohio assault.\n\n\u201cI called the FBI and made the report but to my knowledge, the FBI did not take any action against Epstein or Maxwell,\u201d Farmer stated. \u201cTo my knowledge I was the first person to report Maxwell and Epstein to the FBI.\u201d\n\nAfter the alleged assault, Maxwell and Epstein called Farmer multiple times to threaten her, Farmer claims. The pair also called her art clients and people in New York\u2019s art world in a bid to destroy her career, the affidavit states.\n\n\u201cMaxwell and Epstein worked in concert to make sure that my career and my life was ruined,\u201d Farmer stated. \u201cI was terrified of Maxwell and Epstein and I moved a number of time to try to hide from them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have struggled throughout my life as a direct result of Epstein and Maxwell\u2019s actions against me and my hope is that they will be held accountable for their crimes,\u201d Farmer concluded in the affidavit. \u201cWhile I am still afraid, I am coming forward because I think it is so important to do so.\u201d\n\n\u201c 'Roberts was forced to engage in sexual acts with Dershowitz in, among other locations, Epstein\u2019s mansion' in New York City, the lawsuit claims. \u201d\n\nGiuffre\u2019s complaint provides further details on the scope of Epstein\u2019s alleged sex-trafficking operation, citing flight logs of the financier\u2019s private jet. A graphic of a map inside the complaint shows flights to Tangier, Granada, London and Paris.\n\n\u201cDuring the time period that Roberts was being trafficked by Epstein she was forced to have sex with Alan Dershowitz,\u201d the lawsuit adds. \u201cRoberts was forced to engage in sexual acts with Dershowitz in, among other locations, Epstein\u2019s mansion\u201d in New York City.\n\nGiuffre accuses Dershowitz of lying about flying on Epstein\u2019s private plane, dubbed the \u201cLolita Express\u201d by the media, which he claims he took only with his wife. The lawyer traveled on Epstein\u2019s jet with young women, including a Victoria\u2019s Secret model, the complaint alleges.\n\nDershowitz is also accused by Giuffre of lying about his involvement with another of Epstein\u2019s alleged victims, Sarah Ransome, who now lives in Spain and says she was introduced to Epstein in 2006 when she was 22 and living in New York.\n\nSoon after meeting Epstein, he allegedly flew her to his private isle in the Virgin Islands, where he directed her to have sex with him and \u201cvarious other girls and guests,\u201d according to an affidavit by Ransome, filed as part of Giuffre\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nRansome claims Epstein at one point arranged for Dershowitz to represent her, and during that time, also \u201clent her out to Dershowitz for sex,\u201d the complaint alleges.\n\n\u201cAt his town house I was also lent out by him to his friends and associates to have sex,\u201d Ransome said of Epstein in the court filing.\n\n\u201c She was a woman that was trying to sell a story to the New York Post that she had sex tapes of Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and Richard Branson. \u201d \u2014 Alan Dershowitz\n\n\u201cAmong the people he lent me to was his friend, Alan Dershowitz,\u201d Ransome stated in the filing, dated April 8 2019.\n\n\u201cOn one occasion I was in a bedroom at Jeffrey\u2019s New York townhouse with Jeffrey and Nadia Marcinkova,\u201d Ransome added, referring to a woman identified as one of Epstein\u2019s alleged \u201csex slaves.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter a short time, Alan Dershowitz entered the room, after which Jeffrey left the room and Nadia and I had sex with Dershowitz,\u201d Ransome concluded. \u201cI recall specific, key details of his person and the sex acts and can describe them in the event it becomes necessary to do so.\u201d\n\nDershowitz, as he has in the past, denied ever knowing Ransome.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never met her. I was never her lawyer,\u201d Dershowitz told The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cShe was a woman that was trying to sell a story to the New York Post that she had sex tapes of Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and Richard Branson,\u201d Dershowitz added. \u201cShe claimed to have had sex with practically everyone under the sun, but not me.\u201d", "description": "As new woman claims the billionaire pedophile abused her and her underage sister.", "authors": ["Kate Briquelet", "Lachlan Cartwright", "Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1555454166/190416-briquelet-dershowitz-epstein-tease_uo1zgo", "published_at": "2019-04-16"}
