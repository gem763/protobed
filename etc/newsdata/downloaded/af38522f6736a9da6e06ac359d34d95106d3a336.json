It is important to take action that can help save your lives.\u201d\n\nTens of thousands heeded the advice to huddle in emergency shelters although nerves were further jangled when a 5.7-magnitude earthquake jolted Tokyo and surrounding areas early Saturday evening.\n\n\u201cI evacuated because my roof was ripped off by the other typhoon and rain came in. I\u2019m so worried about my house,\u201d a 93-year-old man told NHK as he sheltered at a centre in Tateyama in Chiba, east of Tokyo.\n\nIn Yokohama, outside of Tokyo, others hunkered down in their homes despite the storm.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 77 and I\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d Hidetsugu Nishimura told AFP.\n\n\u201cWe can hear an infernal din from the rain and the wind, and a fragment of the roof has gone. For an hour, the house was shaking from wind and rain.\u201d\n\nSeveral rivers broke their banks, including the Tamagawa that flows through a residential area of Tokyo.\n\n\u201cThere were parts where the bank was not fully built. We had been dealing with it by sandbagging, but water started overflowing in parts of the area,\u201d land ministry official Shuya Nakamura told AFP.\n\nAmong the missing were three people swept away in their car after a bridge over the River Chikuma broke, local official Masataka Tomi told AFP.\n\nAnother local fire department official in Fukushima said a man and a woman in their 60s were missing following landslides.\n\nThere were fears of more potential flooding after officials opened sluice gates at several dams feared to burst, warning residents downstream to evacuate if possible.\n\nNearly half a million households in the greater Tokyo area lost power at some stage during the storm.\n\n\u2013 Rugby row \u2013\n\nMeanwhile, beleaguered Rugby World Cup officials warned that at least one other fixture cancellation was possible on Sunday after already scrapping two matches scheduled for Saturday.\n\nOrganisers warned people not to travel to the northern town of Kamaishi, an area devastated by the 2011 tsunami where a match between Namibia and Canada was due to take place.\n\nAll eyes are on the crunch Pool A match in Yokohama between hosts Japan and Scotland that will determine which of the two teams progresses to the quarter-finals.\n\nOrganisers have said they will assess venue infrastructure before deciding whether to play the match, amid threats from Scotland of legal action if they are eliminated without getting a game.\n\nWorld Rugby slammed the Scottish comments as \u201cdisappointing.\u201d\n\nsi-kh-sah-ric/ind", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 Powerful Typhoon Hagibis barrelled through Japan Saturday, killing at least two people and lashing large parts of the country", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/12/bf17d9_japan-weather-agency-is-warning-typhoon-hagibis-bring-record-rains-flooding-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
