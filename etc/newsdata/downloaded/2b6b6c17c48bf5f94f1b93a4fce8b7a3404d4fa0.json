The S&P 500 does a bit better than the average September following an August decline of 1.5% or more, falling 0.9%.\n\nAugust has been an even worse month for small-and-mid-cap stocks, as the S&P Mid Cap 400 and S&P Small Cap 600 are on pace for its worst Augusts since 2011, underscoring the struggles of the typical public company that have persisted all year. The equal-weighted Value Line Geometric index VALUG, -1.19%, which tracks the median performance of roughly 1700 publicly listed companies, has fallen more than 15% below its Aug. 29, 2018 highs, illustrating the bifurcated nature of today\u2019s equity markets.\n\nIt\u2019s not all bad news, however. According to a Friday analysis by LPL Financial, the past 15 times that the S&P 500 lost ground in August, the rest of the year saw positive returns every single time.\n\nLPL Financial\n\nSo while September could prove to be a bumpy ride, recent history suggests the pain will not endure.", "description": "August is typically a weak month for stock market performance, and September is the only month that, on average, is worse for equity-market prices", "authors": ["Chris Matthews", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ481_back_t_ZG_20190830104836.jpg"}
