Published with permission.\n\nI was very diligent and organized with the rotation of my Rolodex.\n\nI was a sophisticated hustler who had a lot of haters at work because I was doing the job right. The hate gave me the fuel to endure the fire. I was also a flashy kind of girl. I always had an appetite for nice cars and rims. There was nothing modest about me.\n\nI had regulars at Flashdancers, men who wanted to see me each time they came in. I always attracted the sad type. Some of them seemed to want me on more of a personal level outside the club. The ones who actually wanted me as their girlfriend were relentless in their pursuit to secure a relationship with me.\n\nI would feed them lines like, \u201cI\u2019ve been hurt before\u201d, \u201cI don\u2019t trust guys\u201d, \u201cIf you really want me to date you, you would have to really work at it. It\u2019s gonna take time and patience.\u201d My customers, better known as \u201ccustys\u201d, were persistent, non-aggressive, and willing to be \u201cpatient\u201d while paying me very well for my time. Some of them dated dancers in the past so they knew the rules but also believed I was attainable. I got to know some of them, the real them.\n\nOnce I discovered what the customer needed on an emotional level, I\u2019d transform into just that. I toyed with their mental and emotional state to get what I wanted.\n\nIt was like the girls always told me, If you don\u2019t, someone else will.", "description": "An excerpt from Roselyn Keo's new book,", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/abc_rosie1_le_190910_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
