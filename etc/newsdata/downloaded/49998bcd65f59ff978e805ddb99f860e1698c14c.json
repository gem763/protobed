Yes, we wring our hands over how progressives and conservatives hate one another so much that no candidate, legal decision, movie, restaurant and bakery is free from partisan controversy.\n\nYet here is a unifying issue \u2014 here is a calamity that can strike any of us like a brick falling from a building. The crisis brings misery and death to all races, parties, genders, classes and religions. Here is a nonpartisan, equal-opportunity killer.\n\nThat\u2019s why we have to battle it together. We can still argue over immigration and impeachment, but on this issue we must unify.\n\nThere is some hope. The Trump administration has addressed the crisis \u2014 and with bipartisan support, I\u2019m happy to add. Some 57 federal programs sponsor nearly $11 billion dedicated to prevention, treatment and recovery, as well as research, criminal justice, health surveillance and supply reduction.\n\nIt\u2019s a wonderful start, but there is so much more to do. Let\u2019s not merely react to current suffering. Let\u2019s punish deceitful drug marketers, set up treatment centers and clamp down on prescribing painkillers.\n\nMy view is that Americans can band together to go deeper into this crisis, right to the core issue: how we treat pain. Pain is the body\u2019s reaction to injury, chronic problems and disease. Everyone is susceptible to pain of some kind. It\u2019s a unifying human experience.\n\nLet\u2019s redouble our efforts to find pain treatments that don\u2019t risk drug dependency and addiction. Let\u2019s harness the nation\u2019s research and design resources to produce remedies that end pain, not mask it.\n\nAs for my pain of loss and grief, I don\u2019t think there ever can be relief for that. I just try to channel my emotions into something positive. I hope that our personal experiences can lead to a shared understanding \u2014 and that our divided nation can unite to end the opioid epidemic and save lives.\n\nEric Bolling (@ericbolling) is a financial analyst, the host of \u201cAmerica This Week\u201d on Sinclair Broadcast and the president of JanOne, a company created to find alternative treatments for pain.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
