Perhaps even more crucially, she said, \"startups are finding it easy to find capital there.\"\n\nThe emerging trends from LinkedIn's study are based on the decisions of more than 645 million users. Startups qualify for consideration for the list if they are seven years old or younger, are independent and privately held, and have 50 or more employees. They're more likely to make the list if they're increasing their employee base by at least 15% year over year and have high levels of external engagement. Interest in jobs as well as the quality of jobs employees left to join a startup were also factors.\n\nWhen LinkedIn's editorial employees, including Hempel, looked at the resulting list of startups, they asked: \"What about the nature of work is changing?\"\n\nThe following five trends are answers to that question, along with breakout startups leading those trends and where they fell on the ranking.", "description": "Cannabis, sports betting, and micro-mobility are among the biggest trends that LinkedIn found among top startups this year.", "authors": ["Sherin Shibu"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7016222e22af6fda006993-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
