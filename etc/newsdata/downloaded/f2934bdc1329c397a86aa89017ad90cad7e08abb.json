The charges are not publicly known, but it is believed they relate to espionage: 10-year sentences are regularly handed down for spying in Iran.\n\nMoore-Gilbert is currently being held in Tehran\u2019s notorious Evin prison, reportedly in solitary confinement. She has had limited consular access from Australian officials, and no contact with her family or friends.\n\nAustralia left with few diplomatic levers after three citizens detained in Iran Read more\n\nMoore-Gilbert is a lecturer in Islamic studies at the University of Melbourne\u2019s Asia Institute.\n\nGeorge Rennie, lecturer in politics and lobbying at the University of Melbourne, condemned her arrest by the Iranian regime. \u201c\u2018Humble\u2019 doesn\u2019t quite do Kylie justice. She was a thoughtful and passionate academic. This is a disgusting reflection on the Iranian dictatorship,\u201d he said online.\n\nDavid Malet, assistant professor at the American University\u2019s School of Public Affairs, said he was distraught to learn on Moore-Gilbert\u2019s solitary confinement and her prison sentence.\n\n\u201cI served on Kylie\u2019s dissertation committee.

Enrica Fei, a PhD candidate at the Bundeswehr University in Munich, met Moore-Gilbert at a conference last year, describing her as \u201ca lovely, humble woman and bright academic\u201d .\n\nKylie Moore-Gilbert named as Australian-British academic jailed in Iran since 2018 Read more\n\n\u201cI wondered for months why she\u2019d stopped replying to my emails and never met in the UK, as we\u2019d agreed.\u201d\n\nIn an intervention less likely to soothe diplomatic tensions, US president Donald Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani berated the Iranian regime as terrorists in a post on Twitter.\n\n\u201cDr Kylie Moore-Gilbert, the third foreign national revealed this week to be imprisoned in Iran. Arrested, charged, and convicted for undisclosed actions. Sentenced to 10 YEARS without any public record of a trial! These are typical actions of the Ayatollah\u2019s #REIGN OF TERROR!\u201d\n\nMoore-Gilbert\u2019s research has drawn her into areas that could be perceived \u2013 particularly by an Iranian regime under acute pressure from economic sanctions and deeply suspicious of foreign academics and journalists \u2013 as sensitive. She has written extensively about revolutions and activism in the Middle East, with a particular focus on Shia Islam, Bahraini politics and its protest movements.\n\nMoore-Gilbert\u2019s most recent publications have been journal articles and book chapters on Bahrain\u2019s \u201cFebruary 14\u201d pro-democracy youth movement and online opposition activism during Bahrain\u2019s post-Arab Spring crackdown.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Travel bloggers Jolie King and Mark Firkin were travelling overland from Perth to London when they were arrested in Iran.

The grant was part of the University of Melbourne\u2019s early career researcher grants scheme.\n\nMoore-Gilbert was dux of All Saints College in Bathurst 2005 and graduated from Cambridge University with honours in Middle Eastern studies in 2013.

They have not yet been tried. It is understood the pair were flying a drone \u2013 to shoot pictures for a travel blog \u2013 near to military installations in Jajrood in Tehran province.\n\nThe couple left their home in Perth, Western Australia, in 2017, documenting their travels on a blog called The Way Overland. They planned to drive from Perth to London, documenting their travels for an online travelogue on YouTube and Instagram. Dozens of videos and photographs posted online appear to have been shot using a drone.\n\nWhile news of the trio\u2019s incarcerations only surfaced in the last week, Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, said she has raised their cases \u201cmany times\u201d with her Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif. The ministers met and discussed the cases as recently as this month, Payne told parliament.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mark Firkin and Jolie King were reportedly flying a drone \u2013 to shoot pictures for a travel blog \u2013 when they were arrested 10 weeks ago in Iran. Photograph: Facebook/The Way Overland\n\nPayne has denied the arrests were politically motivated, although commentators have speculated the trio may be being held as \u201cbargaining chips\u201d, giving Iran political leverage on a number of ongoing disputes with the western countries, particularly over oil sanctions.\n\n\u201cWe have no reason to think that these arrests are connected to international concern over Iran\u2019s nuclear program, United Nations sanction enforcement or maritime security concerning the safety of civilian shipping,\u201d Payne said.\n\nA fourth Australian is currently unable to leave Iran, though not imprisoned.\n\nDual Iranian-Australian citizen Meimanat Hosseini-Chavoshi, was arrested in December last year as she attempted to leave Iran.
