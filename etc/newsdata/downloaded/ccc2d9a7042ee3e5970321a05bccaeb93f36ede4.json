REUTERS/Beawiharta/File Photo\n\nIndonesia, which is the world\u2019s biggest Muslim-majority country, is grappling with a resurgence in militancy and hundreds of suspects have been detained under tighter new anti-terrorism laws since the beginning of 2019.\n\nMinister Wiranto, 72, who like many Indonesians uses just one name, underwent surgery in Jakarta after sustaining two wounds to the stomach in the attack after he opened a university building in Pandeglang town.\n\nHe was the first senior politician to be attacked in recent years and the president said he should be the last.\n\n\u201cEven when we already have security measures in place, they should be tightened so that what happened to Wiranto won\u2019t happen again,\u201d Widodo told reporters at the hospital after visiting the minister.\n\n\u201cHe is getting better, he was able to communicate with me,\u201d Widodo said, adding that the security minister had asked to take part in government meetings.\n\nPolice arrested a man and a woman they suspected were a couple, and confiscated sharp objects that they were carrying, including knives and scissors.\n\nThe head of Indonesia\u2019s main intelligence agency, Budi Gunawan, said that the perpetrators were affiliated with the Islamic State-linked militant group Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD).\n\nThe government scrambled to tighten its anti-terrorism laws after a series of suicide bombings linked to the JAD group killed more than 30 people in the city of Surabaya last year.\n\nThe attack came days before Widodo is due to be sworn in for a second term in office on Oct. 20.\n\nLuhut Pandjaitan, the coordinating minister overseeing maritime and natural resources, told reporters on Friday that the attack would not have an impact on the inauguration.\n\nWiranto has served as chief security minister in Widodo\u2019s cabinet since 2016.\n\nA retired general, he is considered a product of the late former strongman Suharto\u2019s \u201cNew Order\u201d administration, which gave a big political role to the military and stifled opponents.\n\nHis appointment drew criticism from rights groups for his involvement as chief of the armed forces in the bloody upheaval in East Timor.\n\nWiranto was indicted by a U.N. panel over the bloodshed surrounding East Timor\u2019s 1999 independence vote, when about 1,000 people were killed. He denied any wrongdoing in East Timor.", "description": "Indonesian President Joko Widodo said on Friday he had ordered tighter security for state officials a day after a suspected Islamist militant stabbed the chief security minister as he was greeting crowds in a provincial town.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439581108&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A0FY", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
