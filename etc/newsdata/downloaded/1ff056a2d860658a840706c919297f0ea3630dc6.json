It was assuredness during the 2016 referendum campaign that Brexit would result in recession and job losses that led those supporting departure from the EU to disparage the forecasters as experts who were wrong.\n\nThe UK economy continued to grow (if at a subdued pace), and economists were left scrambling to explain how jobs were still being created at record rates.\n\nThis is why, as we start a UK election campaign where Brexit and fiscal policy will be at the centre stage, we should be sceptical about bold predictions.\n\nSubdued: As we start a UK election campaign where Brexit and fiscal policy will be at the centre stage, we should be sceptical about bold predictions.\n\nThis year's Nobel prize-winning economists Esther Duflo and Abhijit Banerjee (writing in The Guardian) note that economists, at a 30 per cent trust level, are less regarded than any profession other than politicians. So when economists tell citizens that imposing tariffs will be harmful to their well-being, most of the public disagrees.\n\nThere are several reasons for this dissonance. Economists are so wrapped up in their models and theories that what is going on in the real world is often ignored. That is why so few economists saw the Great Recession coming, even though it was startlingly obvious that the financial crunch which preceded it was a crushing blow to credit, which drives growth.\n\nIt is also argued that economic experts on TV and in the Press are untrustworthy because they work for organisations seeking to peddle their services.\n\nThe IMF is largely regarded as providing gold standard forecasts. But placed in the hands of politically-savvy managing director Christine Lagarde, the IMF view during the referendum campaign was that Brexit would have 'pretty bad, to very bad' consequences for Britain.\n\nShe may have been right. This is not because of economic forecasts but because Britain has been living with a government neutered by Parliament.\n\nThe reality of the IMF forecasts, for both a frictionless deal with the EU or a cliff-edge Brexit, is of the loss of 3 per cent to 5 per cent of output over seven to ten years. Even if we could be assured this modelling is correct, of far more significance may be the fallout from the US-China trade war and problems with Europe's manufacturing sector caused by motoring's green revolution.\n\nDifficulties with projections come when we treat them as holy writ rather than guidance. Mark Carney's observation at the IMF that a Brexit deal would unleash investment is a case in point. It is a forecast based on the surveys of the Bank of England's agents and his six years as its Governor.\n\nLabour's muddled approach to Brexit and Liberal Democrat demands for a second referendum would layer new uncertainty on the economy. That could do long-term damage to confidence and entrepreneurship.\n\nMiracle drugs\n\nAmong Labour's policies is a shake-up of the pharmaceutical sector, creating a state-owned generic drugs firm to supply the NHS and a crackdown on medicine prices.\n\nBut the party needs to be mindful of what it is wishing for. In quick succession Britain's leading-edge pharma companies, Astrazeneca followed by Glaxosmithkline, have offered the stock market that most rare of things \u2013 earnings upgrades.\n\nGlaxo shares zipped up 2.4 per cent after chief executive Emma Walmsley unveiled higher than expected profits. Growth is being driven by vaccines, with shingles treatment shingrix recording a 76 per cent jump in sales in the second quarter to \u00a3535m.\n\nShe deserves credit for strengthening the consumer health arm through a joint venture with US rival Pfizer. Sales in this division climbed by 25 per cent overall.\n\nGlaxo may have lost ground to Astra in cancer treatments but it may have a winner with a treatment for cancer of the womb, set for regulatory approval this year.\n\nCheaper drug prices is an attractive slogan but not if it slows research and development, innovation and earnings.\n\nForgotten man\n\nSpeculation that Boris Johnson favours former Bank of England deputy governor Paul Tucker to replace Mark Carney on January 21 will have City grandees seeking insights into his thinking by dipping into Tucker's 642-page tome, Unelected Power.\n\nIt advocates that central bankers rediscover their role as stewards of the common good and do not become 'over-mighty citizens'.
