Gradu, a distinguished engineer, is an officer and the 2018 President of SAE International. He will review how lidar sensors deliver outstanding perception performance in three dimensions, allowing vehicles to detect and avoid objects in a range of environmental conditions and roadway settings. Furthermore, he will discuss the critical success factors in testing and validation that lidar sensors must achieve to support autonomous vehicles (AV) and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).\n\nMircea Gradu, Velodyne Lidar SVP of Quality and Validation, discusses Velodyne\u2019s smart, powerful sensor solutions for autonomy and ADAS at GITEX Technology Week in Dubai.\n\nThe first panel, \u201cTeaching Vehicles to Think, Drive and Talk,\u201d occurs on October 7, from 2:40 to 3:10 p.m., at the Vertical Stage 1, Za\u2019abeel Hall 4. Gradu will provide information about how advanced sensor technologies generate massive amounts of data. The future AV will generate two petabits \u2013 about the same as two million gigabits of data.\n\nThe second panel, \u201cDriverless Vehicles will be Safe, Ready and Common on the Road by 2030,\u201d occurs on October 8, from 3:30 to 4:15 p.m. at the Future Mobility Conference, Sheikh Maktoum Hall. Gradu will discuss how lidar sensors are an essential component for fully autonomous vehicles and can significantly enhance ADAS capabilities.\n\nVelodyne has more than a decade of experience in the manufacturing and validation of lidar sensors that support the stringent safety and reliability requirements of automotive OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers. By developing a portfolio of smart, powerful sensors, Velodyne Lidar has established itself as a leading developer, manufacturer and supplier of real-time lidar sensors.\n\n\u201cGITEX is a great opportunity to bring together some of the hundreds of companies and thousands of people working on AV and ADAS technologies,\u201d said Gradu. \u201cVelodyne is committed to fostering this industry\u2019s efforts and learning experiences to help make our roadways safer \u2013 sooner, rather than later.\u201d\n\nAbout Velodyne Lidar\n\nVelodyne provides smart, powerful lidar solutions for autonomy and driver assistance.
