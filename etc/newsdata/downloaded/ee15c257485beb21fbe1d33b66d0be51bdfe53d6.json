(CSE: SPR) (FRA: 38G) (OTCQB: SRUTF) (\u201cSproutly\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) today announced the Company\u2019s financial results for the second quarter ended August 31, 2019.\n\n\u201cWe hit a key milestone in the second quarter as we completed our first commercial sale of cannabis flower, and followed that up with another milestone shortly after the end of the quarter\u201d said Keith Dolo, Chief Executive Officer of Sproutly. \u201cWe were thrilled to receive our Flower Sales License from Health Canada effective October 16, 2019. This allows us to bring to market our dried flower products into the hands of recreational consumers throughout the country and commercialize our CALIBER brand of premium cannabis products. We anticipate more growth as we begin to generate revenue from the sales of our flower as we move into Q3. We continue to execute on our plans to achieving our goal of becoming a leader in the cannabis infused product category.\u201d\n\nHighlights for the Second Quarter Ended August 31, 2019\n\nThe Company recorded its first commercial sale of cannabis flower in Canada.\n\nToronto Herbal Remedies (\u201cTHR\u201d) (the Company\u2019s wholly-owned licensed cannabis producer) submitted an amendment for a sales license for cannabis flower and oil. THR has successfully completed its first packaging run for both cannabis flower and oil products and has provided all supporting documents to Health Canada.\n\nThe Company completed a voluntary debt for shares settlement agreement with an arm\u2019s length creditor, settling an outstanding current debt of $3,537,455 by issuing 4,716,606 common shares at a price of $0.75 per share and improving its working capital position.\n\nThe Company successfully completed the first run of the proprietary Aqueous Phytorecovery Process (\u201cAPP\u201d) extraction technology licensed from Infusion Biosciences Inc. at THR.\n\nSubsequent Events\n\nTHR received its sales license for cannabis flower from Health Canada. The Flower Sales License will allow THR to sell dried cannabis flower products provincially and territorially in Canada through authorised distributors and retailers. The sales will commence through the launch of Sproutly\u2019s premium cannabis brand CALIBER.\n\nInfusion Biosciences Inc. (\u201cInfusion\u201d) and BNO Holdings Inc. (\u201cBNO Holdings\u201d) developed and verified analytical methods that detect, identify, and measure cannabinoid molecules in water-soluble (\u201cInfuz2O\u201d) and oil preparations (\u201cBio-Natural Oil\u201d) derived from cannabis and hemp using APP Technology (collectively, the \u201cDeveloped Analytics\u201d). APP Technology is a patent pending process that uses proprietary reagents to recover naturally occurring water-soluble cannabinoids as well as the cannabis oils.\n\nThe Company expanded its operations with a new manufacturing facility in close proximity to the THR production facility in Scarborough, Ontario. The additional property allows the Company to continue to centralize operations in the Greater Toronto Area, as well as providing manufacturing capabilities for its proprietary reagents, a key input for the APP Technology cannabinoid recovery process.\n\nConference Call and Webcast Information\n\nSproutly will host a conference call on Thursday, October 31, 2019 at 10:00 AM Pacific Time, 1:00 PM Eastern Time to answer questions about the Company\u2019s financial highlights.
