REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration/File Photo\n\nSHANGHAI (Reuters) - MSCI (MSCI.N) plans to include stocks listed on China\u2019s newly-launched, Nasdaq-style STAR market in its indexes from next month, as international investors seek opportunities in the world\u2019s second largest economy.\n\nBeijing is continuing to open up its financial markets despite the ongoing Sino-U.S. trade spat, while major index providers, including MSCI, FTSE Russell and S&P, have begun or are stepping up index inclusion of China A-shares.\n\nStocks listed on China\u2019s STAR market will be included in the MSCI China Indexes and their derived indexes, if they meet eligibility requirements, MSCI said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nThe move could potentially improve liquidity in the market and expand foreign investors\u2019 access to the country\u2019s tech sector, to which Beijing is providing policy support to reduce its foreign dependence.\n\nChina launched STAR in July, as Beijing seeks tech self-sufficiency amid the bruising trade war with the United States.\n\nMSCI said the inclusion is separate from adding China A shares to MSCI China and the MSCI Emerging Markets Indexes.\n\nFollowing MSCI\u2019s announcement, 32 of the 33 stocks on the STAR market gained ground on the day.", "description": "MSCI plans to include stocks listed on China's newly-launched, Nasdaq-style STAR market in its indexes from next month, as international investors seek opportunities in the world's second largest economy.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439167644&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF990H1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
