On average, analysts polled by FactSet expect August quarter revenue of $4.59 billion (down 46% annually) and non-GAAP EPS of $0.51 (down 86%).\n\nFor the November quarter -- Micron has been providing quarterly guidance on its earnings call -- the consensus is for revenue of $4.79 billion (down 39%) and non-GAAP EPS of $0.52 (down 82%). With the help of easier annual comparisons, revenue is currently expected to drop by a more modest 19% during Micron's February 2020 quarter, and to grow by 5% during its May 2020 quarter.\n\nIn addition to Micron's revenue and EPS numbers, here are some things for investors to watch as the memory giant reports after the bell on Thursday and hosts an earnings call at 4:30 P.M. Eastern Time.\n\n1. DRAM Supply and Demand Trends\n\nThree months ago, markets were encouraged when Micron slightly lifted its calendar 2019 DRAM demand outlook, forecasting that industry bit demand would rise by a mid-teens percentage. Prior guidance for industry bit supply to rise by a mid-to-high teens percentage was maintained.\n\nWith DRAM accounting for over 60% of Micron's revenue, any fresh changes to its full-year industry outlooks will be closely watched. Potentially working in Micron's favor: Smartphone DRAM capacities have been rising; PC demand has been reasonably healthy; there are signs that cloud capital spending is starting to improve; and both Micron and other memory makers have been rapidly slashing their capital investments. Potentially working against it: Smartphone demand has been sluggish (particularly in China), and enterprise server demand has come under pressure.\n\n2. NAND Supply and Demand Trends\n\nIn June, Micron reiterated guidance for NAND industry bit demand to grow by a mid-30s percentage this year, and for industry bit supply to grow by a high-30s percentage. Like DRAM, NAND is facing some cross-currents when it comes to supply and demand trends. Capex cuts, improving cloud spending and rising NAND capacities within smartphones and solid-state drives (SSDs) work in the favor of NAND suppliers, while soft smartphone and enterprise storage demand act as headwinds.\n\n3. DRAM and NAND ASPs\n\nMicron is once more expected to report sequential declines for its DRAM and NAND average selling prices (ASPs). However, with some signs of price stabilization having recently emerged, the declines might be smaller than what was seen in the May quarter, when Micron's DRAM ASP fell by 20% and its NAND ASP fell by a mid-teens percentage.\n\nCurrently, the consensus is for DRAM ASP to have dropped 17% sequentially during its August quarter, and its NAND ASP to have dropped by 10%.\n\n4. The Fiscal 2020 Capex Budget\n\nLook for Micron to share its capital spending guidance for fiscal 2020 (it ends in Aug. 2020) on its call. In June, the company said it expects fiscal 2020 capex to be \"meaningfully lower\" than its capex for fiscal 2019, which it has guided to be around $9 billion. Currently, the consensus is for capex to drop to $7.4 billion in fiscal 2020.\n\nInvestors in chip equipment makers such as Applied Materials (AMAT) , Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) will also want to keep an eye on Micron's fiscal 2020 capex guidance.\n\n5. Inventories\n\nThough its revenue fell 39% annually during its June quarter, Micron's inventories were up 12% sequentially and 36% annually during the May quarter to $4.91 billion, with days of inventory rising by 8 days sequentially to 151. Investors are hoping a sequential decline will be registered for the August quarter.\n\nCEO Sanjay Mehrotra did say in June that Micron expects DRAM inventories to decline and be in \"a relatively good spot\" by year's end, albeit while cautioning they might still not be at \"optimal levels.\"\n\n6. China and Huawei\n\nMicron might provide an update on how its sales to Huawei are trending, and/or what impact it's more broadly seeing from trade tensions. In June, the company noted it has resumed shipping \"a subset\" of products to Huawei after concluding that they aren't subject to U.S. export restrictions.\n\nChina came into the spotlight again for Micron on Tuesday, when President Trump brought up the alleged theft of Micron's intellectual property by Chinese chipmaker Fujian Jinhua during a United Nations speech.\n\n7. Stock Buybacks\n\nDid stock buybacks pick up during the August quarter? Micron spent just $157 million on buybacks during its May quarter, after having spent about $2.5 billion on them during the prior two quarters.\n\nThe company maintains a goal of spending at least half its annual free cash flow on buybacks. However, it's worth noting that FCF (though still positive, unlike during some prior downturns) has fallen sharply in recent quarters thanks to the memory industry's downturn.", "description": "Memory supply and demand trends, stock buybacks and the fiscal 2020 capex budget are among the things to keep an eye on as Micron reports.", "authors": ["Eric Jhonsa", "Micron Reports Earnings On Thursday", "Important Things To Watch", "Memory Supply", "Demand Trends", "Stock Buybacks", "The Fiscal Capex Budget Are Among The Things To Keep An Eye On As Micron Reports.", "Chris Versace", "Bruce Kamich", "Jim Cramer"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/4c46f13c-8129-11e8-ba0e-f5657b6ec779.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
