Global economic growth is slowing and the world\u2019s central banks are lacking much ammunition to stimulate demand, while Germany\u2019s overflowing coffers are a pile of unused ordnance, the argument goes.\n\nBut while German officials say the government is preparing measures to support demand, they are likely to fall well short of the big stimulus the world is hoping for.\n\nThere is no doubt Germany could use a boost. Its gross domestic product dropped 0.1% in the second quarter and is likely to have fallen again in the past three months, putting the country in a recession. In the second quarter alone, the manufacturing sector shrunk almost 5% and exports took their steepest drop in six years.\n\nConfidence surveys point to more gloom ahead. And with the U.S.-Chinese trade war unresolved and the U.K. now increasingly likely to leave the European Union without an agreement next month, things could turn uglier.\n\n\u201cIf there ever was a time for the government to spend more, this would be now,\u201d said Dirk Schumacher, head of European economics at Natixis . \u201cThis would benefit not just Germany but the eurozone as a whole. Everybody is asking for it.\u201d\n\nFaced with this, the finance ministry has been working on proposals worth about \u20ac50 billion ($55 billion) and almost entirely financed by debt, according to two senior officials.\n\nThe bulk of the stimulus would come from not raising taxes to finance the higher welfare spending and falling corporate tax revenues that will occur automatically as profits fall and workers lose their jobs, which would allow the budget deficit to grow.\n\nIncentives to buy electric cars or insulate homes and special rules allowing companies to write down investment faster are also in the cards, as are special-purpose investment vehicles, which thanks to an accounting quirk aren\u2019t subject to the country\u2019s strict fiscal rules.\n\nSuch a package would be projected to boost GDP initially by about 1.5% but faces questions about its potential effectiveness.\n\nThere is no consensus on what would be an appropriate amount to spend. Some economists have called for hundreds of billions. Others much less. The issue isn\u2019t so much the amount of spending\u2014but the following caveats.\n\nFirst, Germany\u2019s fiscal rules allow a government budget deficit of up to 0.35% of GDP\u2014about \u20ac12 billion\u2014a year. Using off-budget vehicles could raise this somewhat before Germany hits the eurozone\u2019s hard fiscal limits.\n\nJens S\u00fcdekum, a professor at Heinrich-Heine-University in D\u00fcsseldorf, reckons Germany could raise its deficit to about \u20ac35 billion a year without breaking any rules. This would mean spreading the government\u2019s planned largess over two years: Not exactly a big-bang stimulus.\n\n\u201cThe government seems to have decided it will not slam on the brakes in case of a recession,\u201d said Mr. S\u00fcdekum. \u201cThe question is whether that is too little, too late.\u201d\n\nThe second concern is timing. Many economists want Germany to act now. But because of how the stimulus is designed, it wouldn\u2019t kick in until well into a recession, when much of the damage has already happened.\n\nOne reason the government is taking its time is politicians\u2019 reluctance to appear too alarmed. As one senior official puts it, \u201cwe have more than enough money and instruments to apply in case of a recession, but we will not talk ourselves into one.\u201d\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel played down the likelihood of a pre-emptive strike two weeks ago, saying \u201cI don\u2019t see the need for fiscal stimulus.\u201d\n\nDavid Marsh, chairman of OMFIF, a London-based economic think tank, sees \u201ca new openness by the government [regarding deficit spending] and that\u2019s progress\u2026But it certainly won\u2019t take the pressure off the European Central Bank\u201d to continue supporting the eurozone\u2019s economy.\n\nLastly, even as the government slowly warms to the notion of supporting demand, other potential policies point in the opposite direction, at best muddying the message, at worst threatening to neutralize the fiscal boost.\n\nThe Social Democrats, the junior member in Ms. Merkel\u2019s coalition, unveiled plans this week for a \u20ac10-billion-a-year wealth tax. Several party leaders have also called for an increase in the top rate of income tax, even though Germany has the highest taxes on labor after Belgium according to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n\nAnother example: A package of environmental measures that the government will unveil this month could include some growth-boosting policies. But it could also feature a carbon tax, which would have a chilling effect.\n\nWith opinion polls showing that fiscal prudence remains highly popular, there are still misgivings among many politicians about breaking with five years of budget surpluses; especially as Berlin braces for early elections should Ms. Merkel\u2019s fragile government fall.\n\nMichael H\u00fcther, director of the German Economic Institute, a business-affiliated think tank, says the fixation on balanced budgets \u201cis preventing a sober analysis of the situation\u2026I\u2019m not saying we need a huge spending plan tomorrow, but we need confidence that something will be done.\u201d\n\nShare Your Thoughts Do you think Germany should be playing a larger or smaller role in combating a global economic slowdown?
