HBCU leaders defend their decision to maintain the relationship, saying working with the administration is key to securing the federal funding necessary to keep their universities running.\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now.

Little more than one month into office, he moved the White House Initiative on HBCUs from the Department of Education to the White House \u2014 something black leaders called for under the Obama administration.\n\nProponents of the move saw it as a good-faith decision by Trump and a sign that he was open to both listening to their leaders and delivering results. More than half of the administrative offices for the initiative, however, remain in the Department of Education.\n\nLike most university leaders, HBCU presidents have courted presidential administrations regardless of their political leanings. On average, historically black institutions rely on the federal government for half of their total annual revenue to operate.\n\nThat\u2019s left HBCU leaders in a bind when it comes to their relationship with Trump. They\u2019re leery of alienating the administration even as the president maintains an approval rating among African-Americans of just 9 percent, according to the most recent CNN/SRSS poll.\n\nAware of the potentially negative optics of appearing too close to the president and his administration, one HBCU president who requested anonymity told POLITICO that while HBCU leaders actively attended the week\u2019s business meetings, they did not participate in a public photo opportunity.\n\nMost sought to keep the focus on the challenges facing their institutions \u2014 not on the president\u2019s rhetoric.\n\n\u201cThis conference is separate from the president\u2019s vision,\u201d said Anthony Jenkins, president of West Virginia State University, who said he did not attend Trump\u2019s remarks due to a scheduling conflict. The president\u2019s support, he continued, \u201cIs one part of a piece of pie. It is one sliver of what needs to be done. It\u2019s going to take a comprehensive, joint effort.\u201d", "description": "Trump pointed to what he said were record-low unemployment and poverty rates for African Americans.", "authors": ["Maya King"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/95/0c/42adbee94aa7b1f1b71ad4c3064c/20190910-trump-hbcu-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
