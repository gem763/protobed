Eskom & SOEs - and these are the biggest worries that will be giving him sleepless nights ahead of that speech...\n\n- and these are the biggest worries that will be giving him sleepless nights ahead of that speech... Moody's looms - and then there is what is on the line, with Moody's Credit Rating decision due in and around the date of the budget speech...\n\n- and then there is what is on the line, with Moody's Credit Rating decision due in and around the date of the budget speech... Turkey invades Syria - as the US moved out of Syria, Turkey moved in on a full-scale offensive war...!\n\nFrom the open of markets on Monday, the was on the back foot, quickly moving as per our forecast from Friday. The low had been right in our target area, but now the ZAR was on the upward trail, as we headed into a week of uncertainty.\n\nThe biggest uncertainty had to be the Trade War, as the pendulum swayed from side to side...who was going to crack first?\n\nChina started the week with putting a dampener on things by stating that they will not be looking for a broad trade deal and will be keeping certain issues off the table to make matters worse, Trump blacklisted another 28 Chinese organizations.\n\nAs this went on, the slowly edged its way up to R15.31 amidst the uncertainty...this was a little higher than our ideal target area from Friday, but still as per our overall predictions.\n\nThen it was time for our next forecast on Wednesday.\n\nWith the having slightly recovered to R15.17, the trend was for a break below R15.0896 confirming a move down into a target area of R14.95-14.79 or lower.\n\nUSD/ZAR Short Term Outlook - 9 October 2019\n\nIt appeared we were in for an interesting second half of the week.\n\nAnd interesting it certainly was!\n\nOn Thursday came news of a potential \"mini-deal\" between the US and China on currency, which was at least one step in the right direction.\n\nAnd then the big news for the week came on Friday: Trump saying that \"good things are happening\" in the China trade talks, and \"Warmer feelings than in recent past\".\n\nThe surged 450 points on this news - and the Trade War had a positive close to the week!\n\nAs for the , it EXPLODED lower to touch sub R14.75!!\n\nUSD/ZAR Chart\n\nIt was more a case of Dollar weakness than strength, as we saw the Dollar Index take a sharp tumble...despite this being Dollar-positive news!\n\nSo, contrary to logic (the news should have been Dollar-positive), but exactly in line with Elliott Wave analysis...\n\n...it isn't always perfect, but the science still amazes me every time!\n\nAnd then, in other global and local news...\n\nOver in the Middle East, tensions have raised a notch as Trump withdrew US troops from Syria following a call with the Turkish government - which was followed by an immediate assault from Turkey on Syria. It is a thorny issue with different US allies and enemies within the two countries...and the net result of the decision has been a launch of full-scale war from Turkey.\n\nThere were many issues for Mboweni to consider prior to his budget speech, and one of the biggest was Eskom. The National Treasury published a report proposing a bailout plan for our favourite SOE, Eskom. The proposal suggests funding of R23bn for 2019-2020 and R33bn for 2020-2021, together with a number of new conditions Eskom would have to adhere to. These came after disastrous financials showing an after tax loss for Eskom of R21bn, up from R2.3bn last year. The plan of breaking up Eskom and finding a solution to SAA & SABC are the 3 biggest SOE problems right now and are crucial to showing Moody's that SA is serious about turning things around, and things are actually moving in the right direction.\n\nIn reality, SA is in a very difficult position economically. The World Bank just cut its financial market forecasts for South Africa once again, as a \"sharp slowdown was noted\". But despite the worsening economics, most investors believe that SA will not be junked. But not all have this view, as some experts with a high success rate of predicting #JunkStatus have said that chances are low of SA surviving... All in all, it makes for quite a showdown at the end of this month.\n\nIn more positive news, in Ramaphosa's \"From the desk of the President\" newsletter, he focused on his discussions with the Nigerian President and noted plans to strengthen trade agreements within Africa. His view was South Africa's future is within Africa, and with Africa. For that to become reality, stronger trade deals were certainly needed!\n\nAnd that was the wrap for the week.\n\nThe had jumped hurdles, through hoops and climbed overhangs to end the week strongly on the front foot.\n\nWhat a few days it was the ZAR and the Elliott Wave Principle!\n\nThe Week Ahead (14-18 Oct 2019)\n\nThis week sees not a lot in terms of economic data releases, but there is still plenty to keep the market on the edge of their seats, what with Turkey & Syria, Trade War updates, Brexit looming, Mid Term Budget and Moodys (NYSE: ).\n\nAfter a tremendous week for the , the question is - can the Rand extend its gains of the past 2 weeks?\n\nAgain, based on our latest analysis, the answer is a likely yes, but again, do not expect it to be one-way traffic.\n\nWe have some key levels this next week to watch, which could make this week a watershed one.\n\nLook forward to sharing my outlook with you.\n\nTo your success~\n\nJames Paynter\n\nLearn more by clicking here", "description": "Forex Analysis by James Paynter covering: USD/ZAR, Dow Jones 30 Futures, Moodys Corporation.
