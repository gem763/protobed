His tennis is finally buzzing again, after a series of morale-boosting performances in China. Yet his wife Kim is in the late stages of her third pregnancy, and Murray will drop everything to be at the birth. He owes her too much to miss it.\n\nAs Murray admitted this week, Kim has played a central role in his recent resurgence. Sidelined for the best part of two years by an arthritic hip, it would have been easy to admit defeat. But she kept bucking him up, and he kept experimenting with different options, from an arthroscopy in January 2017 to new-agey rehab techniques in Philadelphia six months later. Without her support and boundless positivity, he might already have retired.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a number of times in the last two years that I had stopped,\u201d Murray explained on Monday, as we sat in a deserted corner of Antwerp\u2019s Lotto Arena. \u201cI was like \u2018I don\u2019t want to do this any more.\u2019 But Kim, she was always trying to keep me going, and trying to help get me back on the court, stay motivated, and always happy for me to go and train and go away and stuff.\u201d\n\nLiving with constant pain is a debilitating business \u2013 not just for the sufferer but for their family and friends. In Murray\u2019s case, the injury took away his self-image and his way of life, leaving him marooned on the couch for long periods. It was a dark time, which placed everyone \u2013 including his coaching staff \u2013 in a state of chronic uncertainty.\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019m through the other side of it I realise how difficult it is for everyone around you,\u201d said Murray, of his time in the wilderness. \u201cSometimes you\u2019re probably selfish and are thinking just about yourself, and \u2018God, I\u2019m in this much pain\u2019 but also there\u2019s a lot of people around you that are going through that as well. There\u2019s lots of conversations that I\u2019m not part of that my family is having with my team.", "description": "As Andy Murray warmed up for Tuesday's match in Antwerp, he had one eye on his phone.", "authors": ["Simon Briggs", "Tennis Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/tennis/2019/10/15/TELEMMGLPICT000213106448-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqD3d2dmOlWYuQkR76XZjLQHpUfQBlErIE_agMol3rEvg.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
