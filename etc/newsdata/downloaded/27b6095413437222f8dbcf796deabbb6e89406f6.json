Try These Bedtime-Story Apps", "language": "en", "text": "FOR DECADES, I\u2019VE BEEN among the 35.2% of adults restlessly failing to get the recommended seven hours each night. I\u2019ve tried burying myself under a weighted blanket and misting my room with sleep-inducing essential oils. My white-noise machine is no match for the blare of New York City traffic that only seems to grow more intrusive after sunset.\n\nBut maybe I\u2019ve been trying too hard. According to Dr. Lynelle Schneeberg, a Yale Medicine psychologist and author of \u201cBecome Your Child\u2019s Sleep Coach,\u201d achieving those blissful hours of slumber is just a two-step process: \u201cYou should have a quiet, dark room and something to distract your mind. The end.\u201d\n\nAnd the simplest distraction is one we likely last enjoyed as children: a bedtime story.\n\nShare Your Thoughts What has worked best for you to fall asleep? Share your tips below.\n\nDaily meditation\u2014as steered by digital apps and tools meant to quiet addled adult minds\u2014can sometimes feel more like a chore than a respite. But bedtime stories tell a different tale. They tap into the comforting experience of being read to as a child without requiring you to focus on your thoughts or your breathing, said Dr. Schneeberg. It\u2019s distracting, it\u2019s relaxing, it doesn\u2019t require anything of you. And it\u2019s just interesting enough to keep your brain from bringing up all the fretful thoughts that flood your mind when your eyes close.\n\nNicholas Head, executive producer of content at Calm, a popular meditation app, said an uptick of usage around bedtime witnessed by his team led him to introduce a Sleep Stories category\u2014now with more than 140 recordings.\n\nDon\u2019t Give Up on Your Dreams Plenty of sleep-aiding podcasts and apps are available now. So which is right for you? Illustration: James Gulliver Hancock If You Want a Storybook Slumber... Give a listen to \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d read by British actor Abbe Opher on the Sleepiest app (free for iOS). If You Want a Bedtime Story to Match Your Bed... Swedish IKEA staffers listing product names on the \u201cIKEA Sleep Podcast\u201d may work perfectly for you. If Your Nighttime Routine Lacks Adventure...Seek out \u201cThe Lost City,\u201d a curios tale read by Dan Jones on the Slumber app (free for iOS) If Ken Burns Documentaries Put You to Sleep...Tune in to \u201cCrossing Australia by Train,\u201d narrated by Steen Bojsen-M\u00f8ller on Calm (from $13/mo., calm.com). If You Prefer to Sleep Under the Stars...Try \u201cWoodcraft and Camping,\u201d read by Teddy Sands on the \u201cBore you to Sleep\u201d podcast If You Usually Pass Out to the Syfy channel...Download \u201cA Trip to Venus,\u201d narrated by \u201cSnoozecast\u201d host Nicholas Bernat\n\n\u201cA big reason people have trouble sleeping is because they can\u2019t stop their racing thoughts from the day,\u201d he said. But Calm\u2019s Sleep Stories aim to engross your senses, \u201cso you can let go of the day\u2019s stresses and drift off to sleep.\u201d While most of Calm\u2019s meditations are guided by instructor Tamara Levitt, Sleep Stories\u2019s narrators come from all walks of fame.\n\nThree months into my Calm subscription (from $13/month, calm.com), I doze off easiest while listening to the dulcet tones of English comedian Stephen Fry or \u201cThe Wire\u201d actor Clarke Peters. But with only three stories between them, I had to search for alternatives.\n\nInsight Timer (free, upgrades for $60/year, on Android and iOS) is another meditation-heavy app now dabbling in bedtime stories. Its narrators are less celebrated, but like Calm, it features a mix of classics including \u201cThe Velveteen Rabbit,\u201d and lesser-known fiction like \u201cClaire and the SageWoman.\u201d\n\nIf scrolling through a smartphone to find a story each night seems too tedious, you can simply ask Alexa to read you a random tale. Or request that she play you a downloaded audiobook (Siri\u2019s got you covered here, too) like \u201cBedtime Stories for Grownups\u201d whose author and narrator, Ben Holden, quenched my thirst for sedating British accents.\n\nSome popular podcasters also dose listeners with 30-ish-minute stories carefully selected for optimal zzzzzs. Kathryn Nicolai, host of \u201cNothing Much Happens,\u201d writes and narrates her stories, but she\u2019s not offended if you pass out before the final takeaway. \u201cI want people to know you\u2019re not going to miss anything. This is just a track to steer your mind to.\u201d\n\nOn \u201cBore you to Sleep,\u201d host Teddy Sands dully reads Jane Austen, Herman Melville and other public domain authors. \u201cThe speed of the reading is slow,\u201d he said, \u201cwith the aim of keeping the heart rate and brain activity low.\u201d\n\nVictoria Lockard and Nicholas Bernat, sleep partners and two-thirds of \u201cSnoozecast,\u201d first test texts they select for the show\u2014ranging from \u201cPeter Pan\u201d to Albert Einstein\u2019s \u201cThe Meaning of Relativity\u201d\u2014on each other. Anything is fair game so long as it\u2019s not too jarring like, say, \u201cThe Call of the Wild\u201d by Jack London. \u201cWe were surprised by how disturbing and violent it was. But it was so gripping,\u201d said Ms. Lockard, who eventually found a long, suitably boring passage befitting of bedtime.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal is not compensated by retailers listed in its articles as outlets for products.
