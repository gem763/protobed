I\u2019m Neil Cavuto and, like you, I\u2019m a little stunned and a little heartbroken,\u201d Cavuto said at the top of his show. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say. Shepard Smith, as I said, just a few days ago on this very network, a decent human being, a heart as big as Texas. I didn\u2019t say Texas at the time. Maybe just lower Manhattan. It \u2014 wow. A better newsman you probably cannot find. Again, a bigger, more emotionally connected to humankind, you cannot find.\u201d\n\nCavuto may have seemed a little lost, but he turned things around into a fitting tribute for Smith who, alongside Cavuto, had been at Fox News since the channel\u2019s inception in 1996.\n\n\u201cShepherd, I don\u2019t know what the heck you are planning to do or where you go but I just know you will be great at doing it and you deserve the best that life has to offer,\u201d he said.\n\nHe then apologized to viewers for being a little off.\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m a little shell-shocked here, but I\u2019m going to miss my buddy,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nTrump's War With Fox News Heats Up As Neil Cavuto Delivers Fiery Takedown\n\nFox War: Tucker Carlson And Shep Smith Are Feuding On Live TV\n\nShepard Smith Leaves Fox News After Clashing With Pro-Trump Pundits\n\nAlso on HuffPost\n\nSalute To FOX News Channel's Brit Hume\n\nWASHINGTON - JANUARY 08: FOX News host Shepard Smith poses on the red carpet upon arrival at a salute to FOX News Channel's Brit Hume on January 8, 2009 in Washington, DC.
