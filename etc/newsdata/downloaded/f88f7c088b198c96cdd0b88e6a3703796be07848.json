But it said the exchanges were not mentioned in official records, suggesting that the \u201creview process is not transparent and that decisions are not rendered based on evidence contained in the record.\u201d\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Commerce made the decision without seeking other opinions, creating \u201cthe perception of undue influence,\u201d the IG said.\n\nRulings on exemption requests by Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security are supposed to be final. But the IG found evidence of \u201can unofficial appeals process\u201d in which officials at the bureau reconsidered their decisions when other companies objected. Still, the IG found no evidence that any decisions had been changed.\n\nIn a statement, Commerce said it \u201chas taken numerous steps to safeguard\u201d the process. But it said it takes the IG\u2019s critique seriously and \u201cplans to further improve transparency.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to protect traditional American industries like steel and aluminum from foreign competition he sees as unfair. Last year, he used a little-used weapon in trade policy that lets him declare specific imports a threat to national security to slap tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum.\n\nThe administration agreed to hear appeals from companies that rely on imported metals. It expected to get 4,500 requests for relief. But through mid-June, according to research by McDaniels and Danielle Parks at Mercatus, it had been deluged with 72,771. Commerce has approved nearly 72% of the requests it\u2019s ruled on.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "A federal watchdog is criticizing the way the Trump administration handles taxes on imported steel and aluminum.", "authors": ["Paul Wiseman", "Bani Sapra"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ap19303708893087.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
