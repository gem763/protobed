Trump and his apologists would like to pretend that\u2019s also the case today \u2014 that Trump pulled U.S. troops out of northern Syria to avoid a war with Turkey. But there is scant chance that Turkish troops would have invaded northern Syria if U.S. troops were standing in the way. That is why President Recep Tayyip Erdogan asked Trump to move the U.S. forces \u2014 and Trump, for reasons that remain mysterious, obliged. (Trump himself admitted in 2015 that \u201cI have a little conflict of interest\u201d because of two Trump Towers in Istanbul.)\n\nThe consequences of the American pullout are proving to be every bit as catastrophic as most observers \u2014 and Trump\u2019s own aides \u2014 had feared. On \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper said that ever since coming to office about two months ago, he had been urging the Turks not to invade Syria. \u201cWe cited all the reasons that are now playing out,\u201d he said. \u201cThe biggest being the likely release of ISIS fighters from these camps and prisons, not just that we see a humanitarian crisis emerging.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf Esper cited those reasons to the Turks, he surely cited them to Trump as well. But the president wasn\u2019t listening, as usual. Now Kurds are being slaughtered, and Islamic State detainees are escaping. With chaos all around, Trump had no choice on Sunday but to order most U.S. troops to scuttle out of Syria in a humiliating defeat. Our forces are leaving so fast they could not take with them, as planned, some 60 \u201chigh value\u201d Islamic State detainees \u2014 i.e., some of the worst terrorists on the planet.\n\nThe Kurds, in turn, had no choice but to invite Syrian regime forces to come to their rescue, thereby handing a massive win not only to Bashar al-Assad but also to his backers in Moscow and Tehran. The one part of Syria that had been under the control of secular moderates \u2014 the Kurds are more progressive on women\u2019s rights than anyone in the region aside from the Israelis \u2014 is now being divided between the brutal forces of Assad and Erdogan.\n\nAfter the Hungarian uprising of 1956, the Bay of Pigs invasion of 1961 and the fall of South Vietnam in 1975, the presidents at the time made somber statements to explain why they did not intervene militarily and to remonstrate over the losses suffered by freedom fighters. Eisenhower, for example, said that \u201cthe United States deplores the intervention of Soviet military forces\u201d and that \u201cthe heart of America goes out to the people of Hungary.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump did not express any such concern for the Kurds who have been fighting at America\u2019s side against the Islamic State. Instead he took a break from golf to tweet: \u201cDo you remember two years ago when Iraq was going to fight the Kurds in a different part of Syria. Many people wanted us to fight with the Kurds against Iraq, who we just fought for. I said no, and the Kurds left the fight, twice. Now the same thing is happening with Turkey...... The Kurds and Turkey have been fighting for many years. Turkey considers the PKK the worst terrorists of all. Others may want to come in and fight for one side or the other. Let them! We are monitoring the situation closely. Endless Wars!\u201d\n\nThat Trump thinks that Iraqi troops fought Kurds in Syria \u2014 rather than around the Iraqi city of Kirkuk \u2014 shows how little he knows about this region. That he is inviting one and all to fight the Kurds (\u201cLet them!\u201d) shows how little he cares about American security, American honor or American allies. That he is now maligning his victims by claiming with no evidence that the Kurds are deliberately releasing Islamic State prisoners to force U.S. intervention shows how cruel and dishonest he is.\n\nThe Republican members of Congress who are apoplectic (\u201cShameful disaster unfolding in Syria,\u201d tweeted Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming) have no one to blame but themselves. They are the ones who continue to support a president who has been unabashed in his love of dictators, his disdain for human rights and his willingness to betray anyone or anything to advance his own interests.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMost of the time, the costs of the Trump presidency are inchoate \u2014 laws are broken, norms transgressed. But when it came to immigrant children in cages or Kurds in the line of fire, the costs are all too human and horrifying. Are you happy now, Trump supporters? Is all this worth a corporate tax cut?\n\nWatch:\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "No president has ever sold out America\u2019s allies as nonchalantly and unnecessarily as Trump has done with the Syrian Kurds.", "authors": ["Max Boot", "Columnist Covering National Security"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2N4rlpsrfB7GFwdmC8s8OZjM0A4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6D5RIWHN6AI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
