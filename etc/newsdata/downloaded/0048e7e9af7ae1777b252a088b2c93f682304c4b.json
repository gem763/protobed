But censorship is the wrong approach and would do more harm than good.\n\nIs free speech on social media still worth the trouble? In response to hate speech, fake news, deep fakes and evidence of psychological harm, there are moves to replace broad toleration of speech on social media with heavier government censorship.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who is testifying Wednesday on Capitol Hill, offered his answer in a speech last week at Georgetown University: \u201cMost progress in our lives comes from regular people having more of a voice.\u201d And with that he affirmed his commitment to free expression.\n\nHe\u2019s right about that.\n\nYes, there\u2019s a lot of ugliness out there. And sometimes social media amplifies that ugliness and pits people against each other. But censorship is the wrong approach and would do more harm than good.\n\nRestricting speech would backfire\n\nWe\u2019ve recently seen abroad how speech restrictions can backfire. Last year, Germany introduced a new law requiring social media companies to remove posts for a wide range of possible infractions, such as posts deemed to incite hatred. But the law became a rallying cry and recruitment tool for people on the far right, who claimed they were being silenced for their ideas.\n\nSince it's extremely difficult to control the flow of information in the 21st century, the law didn\u2019t stop far-right advocacy. It furthered radicalization in deeper corners of the internet. Their tactics evolved, and far-right groups have even gained ground in recent years.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg at Georgetown University in Washington on Oct. 17, 2019.

It would make it harder to reach those considering their ideologies and pull them back from the brink.\n\nThe more effective censorship is in closing off information, the more it jeopardizes the benefits of social media, which depend on being an open platform. That openness has democratized information and made it easier for people to connect with others they wouldn\u2019t ordinarily meet \u2014 often with profound benefits.\n\nOpen dialogue is a force for good\n\nFor example, Megan Phelps-Roper grew up in the infamous Westboro Baptist Church, known for its outrageous insults against the LGBTQ community, veterans and most everyone else. As a spokesperson for the church on social media, Megan\u2019s job was to spread these abhorrent views. But the opposite happened. She started having conversations on Twitter with critics who caused her to question lifelong beliefs. Megan ultimately left the group and became an advocate for respect and inclusion.\n\nThe strong desire to mute the offensive rhetoric of a group like the Westboro Baptist Church is understandable. In fact, it\u2019s human. Yet the Supreme Court ruled 8-1 in 2011 that some of Westboro's \"hurtful speech\" was protected speech. And shutting down the conversation, as Megan's evolution shows, closes off that path to growth and transformation for both the person with hateful ideas and the person who may convince them otherwise.\n\nCruz message to NBA: Don't pander to China's brutal Communist Party, stand up for US free speech\n\nIndeed, emerging research shows that the impacts of social media are as dynamic as people\u2019s interactions.\n\nJanis Whitlock of the Bronfenbrenner Center for Translational Research told Psychology Today this year that the way social media \"can amplify, allow for ceaseless exchange and transcend the natural boundaries that were inherent in everyday life \u2014 for example walls, times of day, location and age \u2014 for millennia is novel.\u201d\n\nAnd all those complexities, both risks and benefits, merit further study.\n\nHow can our country address the challenges of social media without it backfiring or undercutting the benefits these platforms can bring?\n\nDon't censor speech, counter it\n\nOur approach should first and foremost recognize the dignity and equal rights of all people \u2014 even those least deserving of our compassion. That includes both protecting people from acts of violence and meeting ideas with dialogue and counterspeech, not censorship. In doing so, we leave open a path for addressing the roots of the problem.\n\nIndeed, effective strategies are emerging for promoting truth, respect and critical thinking online so that social media enhances democratic society. Scholars at Berkeley are exploring how different mediums of communication impact dehumanization online. New York University faculty members are addressing the gaps that exist in understanding how information flows on different platforms. And people across the country are reminding Americans of our common humanity by sharing their experiences through StoryCorps.\n\nUS values in the balance: As China faces fate on Hong Kong, America and other democracies face a choice\n\nThese stories and studies reaffirm the fundamental truth that humans are complex and wired to be tribal. We can\u2019t expect Facebook to fix the human condition. Other platforms and online communities are ultimately a manifestation and amplification of the best and worst parts of us. Shortcuts, however tempting, are unlikely to help. There are better ways to address the bad and elevate the better angels of our nature.\n\nStanding for free expression in the meantime takes courage. Kudos to Zuckerberg for doing so while we get there.\n\nSarah Ruger is director of free expression at the Charles Koch Institute and vice president of free expression at Stand Together.
