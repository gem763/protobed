Grow up, Rep. Tlaib. Removing a president is serious business.", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE Impeaching a U.S. president might not be the be-all-end-all for their career. We explain why this is the case. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nIf Donald Trump is her tutor on tactics, Rashida Tlaib is doing it wrong. Neither of them serve Americans well by appealing to their coarser appetites.\n\nFor only the fourth time in the nation's history, the House of Representatives has launched an inquiry that could lead to the removal of a sitting president.\n\nAnd now Rep. Rashida Tlaib has marked that solemn occasion with a merchandising campaign for her own line of T-shirts emblazoned with the message: \"Impeach the MF.\"\n\nIt's a prim contraction of the war cry with which the Democratic congresswoman from Detroit made headlines, embarrassed sympathetic colleagues, and secured her status as one of the incumbent president's favorite targets shortly after being sworn in last January.\n\n\"Lean in with me to hold this lawless President accountable,\" Tlaib, who represents Michigan's 13th Congressional District, implored in an appeal posted on Twitter.\n\nLean in with me to hold this lawless President accountable. Together, we will fight back and protect our democracy.\n\n\n\nOur country depends on it!\n\n\n\n...and yes you can even wear what you feel https://t.co/8C3BUfp1kfpic.twitter.com/QwBADidAHo \u2014 Rashida Tlaib (@RashidaTlaib) September 26, 2019\n\nIt's exactly the sort of thing Donald Trump might do, if he were in Tlaib's position \u2014 and it diminishes her, and the seriousness of the task that awaits her and her colleagues, every bit as much as Trump has diminished his own office.\n\nImpeachment is a heavy responsibility\n\nSome context:\n\nI like Rashida Tlaib. I oversee an editorial board that endorsed her in her inaugural run for Congress. We have friendly disagreements about policy, and more frequent ones about tactics, but I have met very few lawmakers who work harder on behalf of their constituents than Tlaib does.\n\nI'm also a champion for class clowns, and for the healing power of comic relief. If it weren't for the Stephen Colberts of the world, my head might have exploded sometime in early 2017.\n\nUkraine scandal fallout: Trump's new impeachable offense is threatening the life of a CIA officer\n\nBut Tlaib is not a late-night comic. She's one of 435 people who may soon be asked to decide whether a president (who came to office via a constitutional process that has assured the peaceful transition of executive power for more than 200 years) should be expelled from office before his term expires.\n\nAnd now she's turned that weighty responsibility into a T-shirt line.\n\nYou can't beat Trump at being small\n\nIt's not funny, and it's another victory for a president who has won his own cheap applause by trivializing his office, mocking his political rivals, and demolishing any pretense of civility. Try as she might, Tlaib will never beat Donald Trump at the art of being small.\n\nBut like Trump, Tlaib risks little by playing to her friendliest audience. Her Detroit-based seat is as indelibly blue as any in Congress. I don't doubt her sincerity, but the fact is that colleagues like Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) and Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Troy and Rep. Justin Amash (I-Grand Rapids) have risked infinitely more in throwing their own support behind an impeachment inquiry.\n\nLike many who championed her candidacy, I was embarrassed when Tlaib made national headlines with her first-day-of-school promise (\"We're going to impeach the mother----er!\") earlier this year.\n\nAim higher than comic relief\n\nBut it was a rookie mistake. And while I had no illusions that it would frighten the exuberant Tlaib into apologetic public submission, I assumed she would emerge from the resulting firestorm with a keener appreciation of the way in which her exuberant style could undermine her substantive agenda.\n\nThis feels different: Donald Trump's defense on Ukraine only makes him look worse\n\nBut it turns out that Tlaib, a notoriously fast study when it comes to policy, is a slow learner when it comes to low politics. And she's using the wrong tutor.\n\nThis is no time for T-shirt slogans, and Tlaib does not serve her constituents well by appealing to their coarser appetites. It's time to get out of Trump's sandbox and concentrate on rebuilding a government that offers its citizens something bigger than comic relief.\n\nBrian Dickerson is the Editorial Page Editor of the Detroit Free Press, where this column first appeared.
