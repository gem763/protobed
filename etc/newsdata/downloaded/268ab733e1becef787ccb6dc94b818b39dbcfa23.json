Starting quarterback Elijah Sindelar missed Purdue\u2019s third game with a concussion and suffered a broken left collarbone in the conference opener. All-American receiver Rondale Moore hasn\u2019t played since hurting his left leg on the same play where Sindelar injured his shoulder, and now major changes could be coming to an offensive line that allowed 10 sacks in last week\u2019s loss at Penn State.\n\nThe bigger concern might be Purdue\u2019s defense.\n\nThe Boilermakers rank last in the league in yards allowed (452.8) and yards passing allowed (290.0), 13th in points allowed (33.0) and 11th in yards rushing (162.8).\n\nAnd now, one week after seeing Penn State score touchdowns on each of its first four drives, Purdue on Saturday will face Maryland, which averages 41.4 points per game.\n\n\u201cI think we made progress (last week), and I do think our guys played hard,\u201d Brohm said. \u201cBut we have got to continue to coach this thing up and take some chances.\u201d\n\nMaryland coach Mike Locksley understands Purdue\u2019s plight as well as anyone.\n\nThe Terrapins defense has allowed the second-highest passing total (251.6 yards) and ranks in the bottom half of the league in most of the key defensive categories. Injuries have already forced Locksley to replace three starters on the offensive line and this week, he expects Tyrrell Pigrome to start in place of the injured Josh Jackson at quarterback.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of confidence in Piggy and his ability to come in and perform and run our offense,\u201d Locksley said. \u201cHis teammates have confidence in him, and I know as a coaching staff we do.\u201d\n\nBrohm just hopes the Boilermakers find some answers quickly.\n\n\u201cSometimes you\u2019ve got to have the perfect balance of being creative but also not doing too much where you lose your fundamentals and your techniques,\u201d Brohm said. \u201cThat\u2019s been the dilemma, making sure you have enough, and making sure your guys know what to do.\u201d\n\nSURE TACKLER\n\nMaryland safety Antoine Brooks Jr. has 30 solo tackles, most in the Big Ten and the 15th-highest total in the country.\n\n\u201cWhen you see a safety lead in tackles, you kind of think, well man, (they\u2019re) getting a lot of big plays,\u201d Locksley said. \u201cBut a lot of his tackles take place around the line of scrimmage.\u201d\n\nBrooks\u2019 value to the Terrapins transcends his performance on the field.\n\n\u201cThe biggest asset is his leadership,\u201d Locksley said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t do it with a whole bunch of talk, and he\u2019s not a guy that stands up in meetings and talks. But he plays hurt, he plays reckless with his body.\u201d\n\nMOON SHOT\n\nPurdue is changing the script this week: Neil Armstrong\u2019s alma mater will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the moon landing with a \u201cCradle of Astronauts\u201d theme.\n\nThe Boilermakers plan to wear all white uniforms, like the original astronauts, and will use white, moon-inspired helmets with the numbers 2, 25 and 64 on the stripe. Those numbers represent how many Purdue alums have walked on the moon, how many become astronauts and the number of missions Purdue astronauts have participated in.\n\nPlayers and coaches also will wear a commemorative patch and the halftime show will include some of the school\u2019s astronaut alums.\n\nMR. TOUCHDOWN\n\nMaryland\u2019s Javon Leake has a knack for getting into the end zone, as evidenced by his performance last week against Rutgers Leake scored on runs of 41 and 12 yards, and he also returned a kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown, helping him earn Big Ten special teams player of the week honors for the second time in his career.\n\nIn a Week 2 upset over No. 21-Syracuse, Leake ran for 107 yards on just seven carries and scored a pair of TDs. Leake has 898 yards in kick returns, 13th in school history, and last year against Illinois became the first Terp to score four touchdowns in a game since D.J. Adams in 2010.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer David Ginsburg in College Park, Maryland also contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Purdue coach Jeff Brohm has spent most of this season scrambling for answers on offense.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Michael Marot"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/11/purdue_penn_st_football_00670_c0-148-3551-2219_s1200x700.jpg?d7607ea02ec9a5889832e974cb0300f48c51d86e", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
