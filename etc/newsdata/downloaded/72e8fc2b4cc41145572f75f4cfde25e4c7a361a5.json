You can deduce what kind of person it is based on that activity,\" he told a news conference.\n\n\"That would be my empirical observation of what he did. I'm not able to confirm anything else about his last seconds. I just can't confirm that one way or another.\"\n\nGen McKenzie said four women - who were wearing suicide vests - and one man were also killed at the compound.", "description": "Grainy footage shows troops closing in on the compound where the fugitive IS leader was holed up.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0F43/production/_109470930_eij95hww4aeielh.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
