Halsell, an agent and former salary cap expert for the Redskins\u2018 front office. \u201cAnd particularly now you see that it worked out for Aaron Donald. It worked out for Khalil Mack. \u2026 Guys understand their leverage is withholding their services. That\u2019s the only way you can stick it to the club because the system is built to the benefit of the club.\u201d\n\nNot every player has this option at their fingertips.\n\n\u201cThe thing I always say about holdouts or acting crazy or being high-drama like an Antonio Brown is you better be special,\u201d said Andrew Brandt, an agent and former front office executive.\n\n\u201cBecause if you\u2019re not, the team is going to quickly move on and you\u2019re just sort of there and be stone-walled. Maybe you\u2019re still on the team. But if you are special \u2026 you have the ability to do something that 99% of the other players can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nForty years ago, agent Leigh Steinberg knew many players who worked second jobs in the offseason. For a player making $12,000 a year in the NFL, playing football wasn\u2019t enough to pay the bills.\n\n\u201cThey couldn\u2019t survive if they didn\u2019t supplement their income by having a second job,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s different now.\n\nThe massive influx of television money \u2014 each NFL team made $274 million last season from revenue sharing, which includes media rights \u2014 and the introduction of free agency in 1993 changed the math.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden, players could get lifetime security and the stars in the game, in all sports, were making enough money to retire,\u201d Steinberg said, \u201cbut also enough money to be able to stand firm in the contract negotiation.\u201d\n\nNFL stars held out before \u2014 with the Redskins, John Riggins (1980) and Sean Gilbert (1997) missed entire seasons over contract disputes \u2014 but in recent years, players willing to sit have hit the jackpot. As Halsell noted, Mack and Donald \u2014 two of the league\u2019s best defensive players \u2014 both signed contracts north of $130 million after holding out. In Mack\u2019s case, the Oakland Raiders traded the three-time All-Pro to the Chicago Bears.\n\nBrown wanted out of Pittsburgh and was granted his request with a trade to Oakland. Holdout Ezekiel Elliott signed a $90 million extension with the Dallas Cowboys \u2014 despite having two years left on his rookie year. Jadeveon Clowney also saw his trade request granted when he refused to sign his franchise tender before being dealt from the Houston Texans to the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nDonald only got what he wanted after a multi-year battle. In 2017, the star defensive end missed the first two games of the regular season \u2014 and reported to the Rams without securing an extension. It was only the following year, when Donald held out again, the two sides finally agreed upon a six-year, $135 million extension.\n\nNot everyone comes out a winner.\n\nHard to win\n\nNFL stars have shown they can win a labor showdown, but the league\u2019s rank-and-file players live in a different world. Multiple experts told The Washington Times that under the current collective bargaining agreement, NFL management holds all the cards.\n\nJason Fitzgerald, the founder of the contract website Over The Cap, said owners can usually wait out a contract dispute.\n\n\u201cThere are way more examples where teams still kind of squash the player very easily rather than giving in and forcing a trade (or) a monster-sized contract,\u201d Fitzgerald said, later adding, \u201cOwners, players, general managers, everybody knows that the playing career for an NFL player is pretty short. \u2026 You don\u2019t have time to give up that kind of money just to sit out on whether it\u2019s principle or just really being upset with something.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have that luxury.\u201d\n\nFitzgerald cited Los Angeles Chargers running back Melvin Gordon\u2019s holdout this season. Gordon has yet to report and has demanded a trade. But if he sits out the entire year, he\u2019ll forfeit $5.6 million \u2014 and his contract will carry over to 2020. Chargers general manager Tom Telesco told reporters Sunday the team was tabling contract talks until after the season, further forcing the running back\u2019s hand.\n\nThe Redskins appear to have similar leverage with Williams. The 31-year-old still has two years left under contract and the Redskins aren\u2019t granting Williams\u2018 request either to be traded or to receive a new contract.\n\nTeams generally avoid giving contracts to a player holding out because they don\u2019t want to risk setting a precedent, Brandt said.\n\nIn an interview with NBC4, team president Bruce Allen said he doesn\u2019t see Williams retiring and indicated he expects the tackle to play football this season. Asked if that meant somewhere else via trade, Allen said: \u201cNo, it\u2019ll be with us.\u201d\n\nWith teams able to fine or suspend players as well as roll over contracts, Steinberg said the rules are \u201cstacked against\u201d a holdout. Unless the player has the public on his side, Steinberg said, teams often don\u2019t feel pressured to make a move.\n\nLeverage, leverage, leverage\n\nLaDanian Tomlinson wants NFL stars to \u201cthink like a basketball player.\u201d The Hall of Fame running back told Yahoo Sports his advice to the Giants\u2019 Saquon Barkley was to be prepared to play with more than one team \u2014 and to never settle for less money.\n\nIn the NBA, many of the sport\u2019s biggest stars (LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant) have changed teams over the past few years \u2014 with many dictating where they want to play.\n\nThat\u2019s not the case in the NFL.\n\nTop football players rarely hit free agency \u2014 with stars, especially quarterbacks, preferring to take their money in advance. Steinberg sees free agency in the NFL as a way to give \u201cB-plus players \u2026 A salaries\u201d because of the limited quality.\n\nWhat would it take for that to change? Patience. Players in the NFL typically don\u2019t become free agents until the fourth or fifth year of their contract, depending on what round they were drafted in. Teams can also use the franchise tag \u2014 giving them at least two more years of control.\n\n\u201cPlayers in the NFL are just scared,\u201d Brandt said. \u201cYou offer them enough money, they\u2019re going to take the deal rather than wait when they\u2019d really have some leverage for free agency.\u201d\n\nLeverage can be difficult to create, but players are seemingly warming up on the idea of trying.\n\nLandon Collins, who signed a six-year, $84 million contract with the Redskins this offseason, told The Washington Times he was prepared to holdout if the Giants had elected to use the franchise tag on him this spring. Collins said players create leverage by their past performance on the field.\n\n\u201cWhat we do, not many people can do,\u201d Collins said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
