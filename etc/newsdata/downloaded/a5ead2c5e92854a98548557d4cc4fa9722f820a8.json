The source did not provide further details.\n\nSamsung declined to comment on Wednesday.\n\nSamsung has promised to usher in a new age of foldables as part of its effort to showcase innovation amid the saturated smartphone market.\n\nThe company announced in July it would be ready to sell the Galaxy Fold in September after making changes including strengthening hinges, which early reviewers had found to be problematic.\n\nThe delays cost the South Korean tech giant sales that could have provided a decent bump in revenue during the slow summer season.\n\nLast month, Chinese rival Huawei Technologies Co delayed the planned September launch of its own first foldable phone, its second postponement this year, as it battles a U.S. trade blacklist that threatens the tech giant\u2019s access to crucial U.S. technologies such as Google\u2019s Android.\n\nSamsung currently offers pre-registration for the Fold on its U.S and U.K. websites.", "description": "Samsung Electronics Co Ltd\u2019s first foldable smartphone, the Galaxy Fold, will go on sale on Friday in South Korea, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1425985640&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8309A"}
