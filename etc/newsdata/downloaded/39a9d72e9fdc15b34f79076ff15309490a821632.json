Kwok/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nOver the summer, the photo-editing app VSCO probably got more organic, word-of-mouth exposure than it\u2019s received in its entire eight-year existence, all thanks to a meme: the \u201cVSCO girl.\u201d The definition is a little fuzzy, but broadly speaking, the VSCO girl is usually a teenage girl who wears oversized T-shirts, keeps her hair in a messy bun, is always applying lip gloss, carries a Hydro Flask everywhere, always has plenty of scrunchies on hand, reflexively drops phrases like \u201cand I oop\u201d to fill blank space in conversations, and laughs like this: \u201csksksksksksksksk.\u201d If you are of an older cohort and still confused, think of the slightly \u201calt\u201d girl in your class who still won class president in a landslide. Importantly, she uses VSCO a lot, applying the app\u2019s signature heavily faded, retro filters to the many photos she takes of her friends and activities (the drainage pipes on the edge of suburban properties have never looked so beautiful and ethereal). A 21st-century update to the taxonomy of high-school social cliques, the VSCO girl became a main character in videos and posts across social platforms like TikTok and Twitter \u2014 boosting the eponymous app to an audience that likely hadn\u2019t heard of it before.\n\nVSCO, like the apps from which it received this summertime boost, is itself a social platform \u2014 but it differs in significant ways from its peers and rivals. It doesn\u2019t display engagement metrics such as likes and follow counts, and it doesn\u2019t make money from ads. Its money comes from a subscription product with plenty of flaw-wiping filters and photo tweaks. Earlier this week, the company released the results of a study about its Gen-Z users (no surprise: the study validates VSCO\u2019s approach) that showed many of its young users reportedly deal with online-related anxiety. CEO Joel Flory sat down with Intelligencer to talk about what it all means.\n\nSo I guess, like, as a crash course for our readers: What is VSCO? Give me the elevator pitch.\n\nVSCO\u2019s a mobile app helps you take professional-quality photos on a mobile device, really focused on both premium high-end photo/video tools, but that are also accessible and easy to use on a mobile device. Kind of a real core piece of it is access to this community really driven around inspiration and education, that helps inspire you to create and share how you see the world.\n\nThe first time I heard about VSCO, it seemed like an add-on for Instagram. Did you take any cues from what they were doing?\n\nNo. Because initially we launched a desktop product that was for Lightroom and Photoshop. And I think the difference was, from the beginning, VSCO\u2019s been about a direct relationship to the consumer, building a product that people are willing to pay for. Instead of creating a platform, which you\u2019re broadcasting to the world, how you want them to see you, kind of putting your brand out there, VSCO\u2019s has always been about the individual. Our mission is to help everybody fall in love with their own creativity. It\u2019s a very journey of self. People say, \u201cOther platforms are how I want the world to see me, VSCO\u2019s the one safe space, how I can share how I see the world.\u201d And so that was very intentional for us from the beginning. There\u2019s very few places where we could share work that was kind of the in between, in the good, the bad, and what we\u2019re trying now.\n\nWhat is the balance between supplying professional-grade photo-editing tools to amateurs, and also pushing this \u201cauthenticity\u201d thing?\n\nThere\u2019s two parts to that. One of our core values is \u201cdo it right.\u201d If something\u2019s worth doing, it\u2019s worth doing right. So when it comes to the tools that we\u2019ve built, we\u2019ve always been very intentional to build the best possible tool for the form factor that we\u2019re building for. Flip side of that being, you know, VSCO itself has played an active role in its community. It\u2019s never been about building a passive platform that we build the tools, we build the community, and then step back and say \u201cwhatever happens, happens.\u201d Something you\u2019ll notice from VSCO from day one is that we\u2019ve had an active voice in our community.\n\nHow big is the editorial team at VSCO?\n\nWe don\u2019t break out based upon numbers. We\u2019re a little over 150 employees right now. We\u2019re curating and highlighting the content that we have already been created.\n\nDo you just look at every post?\n\nWe built the proprietary technology, we call it Ava. That\u2019s our machine-learning computer vision [software].\n\nDoes that stand for anything?\n\nNo, what the core of it is, is that it\u2019s bringing together human curation and computer vision. From the beginning, they\u2019ve been tagging content, less about object recognition (\u201chey, there\u2019s a dog in this photo\u201d) and more about how the image makes you feel or the style. So if you go into the app today, for example, you\u2019ll see a section that is all content based upon content that you\u2019ve engaged with on the platform that Ava recommends. But if you then click in on any image, you\u2019ll start to notice it\u2019s not like you clicked on an image of water and it\u2019s just showing you other water. Maybe it was the texture of the water, the color. And it will start to recommend things that in a way that we wanted, from a creative perspective, to really get you to dive deeper and explore.\n\nSure, but isn\u2019t that creating also spending time in the app?\n\nI mean, yeah, you have to open the app use it. Anything that we build has something under that. But it\u2019s all in service of creation. So all the stats and everything we\u2019re looking at is around content being created, is around content engaged with but not time spent in app. Our business is not selling eyeballs in time spent in app to other brands and companies, but rather, it\u2019s selling a subscription. It\u2019s an experience. So it\u2019s a member experience around a sense of belonging, being a part of the community.\n\nWhat are those premium features?\n\nEverything ranging from over 130 of all of our presets that we\u2019ve created to video-editing tools, and other professional-quality tools. Challenges, which is kind of a combination of editorial and community, so there are prompts to go create with little lightweight guides as catalysts. So that\u2019s really what we\u2019re focused on now.\n\nWhat percentage of VSCO\u2019s user base pays for that stuff?\n\nWe launched the subscription in early 2017, something more than just tools. It was an experience of being a part of something. So both tools and community are part of a subscription. So last year, in under two years, we surpassed 2 million paid subscribers. We\u2019re on pace to double that again this year.\n\nVSCO recently released a study about its Gen-Z users. How much of VSCO\u2019s user base is Gen Z?\n\nSeventy-five percent of VSCO\u2019s user base is under the age of 25. And 55 percent of those paid subscribers are under the age of 25. So the largest segment of those paying us is Gen Z.\n\nSo it costs 20 bucks a year? Is that focus-grouped and engineered for Gen Z? Because it\u2019s not a lot \u2014 I feel like I\u2019ve seen similar services charge more.\n\nFor us to get VSCO off the ground, we picked a price point that we felt was accessible. But it also conveyed the value of what we\u2019re delivering. And so it was something that we were very thoughtful about.\n\nWould you say Gen Z is your biggest focus?\n\nLess targeted to a group and more targeted to a mind-set. So hyperfocused on really, this notion of investing in yourself. And doing that through creative expression. This is the first generation ever, like, before they\u2019re even born, they had some digital footprint. So it\u2019s no shock to me that, you know, we found that 96 percent of those surveyed were aware and acknowledge mental health, and the importance of it, but then the negative impact of social media has on it. And so I think what you\u2019re finding is this hyperaware generation. The study also goes to say more than two-thirds have not posted content, based upon the anxiety.\n\nI guess, in reading all of these stats, maybe some of the behavior seems unique to online spaces, but I don\u2019t know \u2026 When I was a teenager roughly a decade ago or whatever, I had anxiety about social stuff. I worried people were going to make fun of me. How is that different from this? I guess my question is: How much of this is just being a teenager and using social media, and how much of it is actually social media?\n\nI don\u2019t even think it\u2019s about being a teenager. I think it\u2019s life. I think it\u2019s human nature to have a worry what others think about you. I think as we grow, though, the goal is to help people find their voice, to be who they are, and to be confident in who they are. And so VSCO is about creating a space for you to do that. It was very intentional to not show likes or comments for the beginning, to not show following accounts publicly, and actually, to not show the count at all. To have all validation be more private and on the back end. So that when you go to look at a photo, or you go to see someone\u2019s profile, you\u2019re not allowing others to make a judgment for you whether or not this is good, or should find this inspiring. But do you personally have a connection with the image? Do you personally have connection with an individual? And from there, you can establish that relationship.\n\nActually what I think, though, that we\u2019re seeing with Gen Z here is that it\u2019s just like everything times ten. For me back in high school, I had the town that I was living in to worry about. I wasn\u2019t comparing myself to everyone around the world. And you\u2019re being compared to not just kids your age, but to everyone in the world. And there\u2019s this anxiety that comes with \u201cAm I good enough? Am I missing out by not living the life that others are living?\u201d And it was really what we saw was this race to popularity that we felt so compelled to create the communities within VSCO the way that we did, to create a safe space for you to be who you are.\n\nAnd that was back in 2013. So this is like, before this was being talked about, right? Everyone looked at us like, \u201cAre you crazy? Like, you\u2019re foregoing some of the easiest growth tactics in business.\u201d But it\u2019s been very intentional in the beginning.\n\nBut can you see those metrics on the backend? Can you see who the most popular user is or whatever?\n\nNo, because, again, our business is not about getting everyone to follow what is most popular. Our businesses to best understand you, and to serve you the right content that you will find inspiring for you to go create. All the data that we collect is to serve you and to help you on your creative journey.\n\nSo like what sort of data would that be?\n\nJust around the content that you\u2019re engaging with, the images that you\u2019re uploading, and favoriting. So it\u2019s what you share. When you click on an image to publish, or sharing your location data, what you\u2019re typing in as the caption. We\u2019ll start to recommend other content. And if you go into the app under Settings, you can see and also toggle what you don\u2019t want to be sharing.\n\nIf you\u2019re analyzing user uploads and recommending things similar in some way, how do you avoid everything sort of looking the same or everyone just sort of like trending in the same direction? Or do you want that?\n\nNo, no, we don\u2019t. It kind of goes back to everything from how the business has been set up. Our business is a subscription. It\u2019s not whether or not we\u2019re able to reach you with ads, it\u2019s whether you personally find value. If you don\u2019t find things that compel you to create, you don\u2019t find the tools to express yourself however you choose, you\u2019re not going to find value in VSCO.\n\nIs VSCO profitable?\n\nWe don\u2019t disclose that. But I can say that the business is really healthy and growing extremely fast. It\u2019s growing at a pace that we\u2019ve never seen or launched on the app in 2012. With 2 million paid subscribers last year, we\u2019re on pace to nearly doubled it again this year.\n\nJust doing some mental math, so $40 million last year?\n\nWe don\u2019t disclose, but yes.\n\nRegarding VSCO\u2019s arc, I\u2019m not sure which metric to use here, but has the graph been steadily going up? Has it had, like, a pop? And then like a dip, and then going back up again?\n\nOh, it\u2019s been it\u2019s been a great ride. I mean, you know, the business is definitely growing. And like I mentioned \u2026\n\nHas it always been growing?\n\nWell, it\u2019s growing at a pace like we\u2019ve never seen.\n\nWould you say there\u2019s been a resurgence in interest in VSCO?\n\nYou know, I think I would say there\u2019s a growing interest around creativity. You walk around the streets here in New York, and in any city, every billboard, from every phone manufacturer is about the camera. Because we believe that as devices continue to get better and better, because we\u2019re in the business of creating these professional-quality tools, we\u2019re just having more and more opportunities to build great technology and software.\n\nThere\u2019s a term that\u2019s recently popular, the VSCO girl. How would you define that?\n\nOn one end, it\u2019s no surprise, because we see trends like this popping up on VSCO all the time. Granted, with that, I will say, never anything that\u2019s gone global and beyond VSCO the way that this has. But I think at its core, it\u2019s really a testament to what I was talking about with the community, and in particular Gen Z, looking for a safe space to share how they see the world, and truly who they are, free of judgment. And I think what you\u2019re seeing with VSCO girl is an extension of that.\n\nSo given all that you\u2019ve said about being creative, comparing yourself to each other, etc., is it weird that there is an archetype for someone that uses VSCO? Does that run contrary to your operating philosophy?\n\nWe\u2019re working to create a world in which differences are celebrated. There\u2019s space on VSCO in which anyone can share who they are, and how they see the world. And so while VSCO girls represents one group and one style, you\u2019ll see that there\u2019s so much more. And so this is one of many.\n\nYeah, but it\u2019s sort of like how redditors are a specific type of person who uses Reddit. Like there are a bunch of different people who use the site, but there\u2019s one type of person that comes to define it. Is that good? Bad?\n\nA VSCO girl doesn\u2019t define everyone on VSCO. Yeah, it defines a group that\u2019s there, for sure, but there\u2019s so many more. I think the best thing I could encourage you to do is to get on VSCO and you will see that there\u2019s so much more.\n\nSo the community has kind of embraced it?\n\nI think there\u2019s an element of \u201cso what if I am?\u201d [Following our conversation, VSCO presented me with my very own Hydro Flask.]\n\nJulie Inouye, a VSCO communications rep, who came in during the interview: The firm we did the study with is run by Gen-Z people. And one of the things they told me is that, when you or I go on a flight, the last thing I\u2019m doing is using that time to be super-productive. They download, apparently, hundreds of photos, so that they can then edit those photos and reedit things that they\u2019ve done before on a long flight. These are the kinds of behaviors that are so unique to them. They\u2019re taking care of themselves.\n\nI hear what you\u2019re saying. Part of what I\u2019m stuck on is that the behavior doesn\u2019t seem all that different from how people use other apps. Like people on Instagram or whatever are also obsessed with editing photos. So it\u2019s the same behavior. It\u2019s the same type of engagement on a certain level.\n\nIt is very, very different, when you look at someone\u2019s profile, from one platform to another.\n\nIt\u2019s weird to hear the idea that users want to appear more authentic and less perfect and less competitive and then also hear that they\u2019re spending hours editing photos. It seems contradictory.\n\n[Boots up his phone.] If we can use one of the self-proclaimed VSCO girls, Hannah Meloche: You look at her VSCO, there are many things that are not of her. These aren\u2019t the perfect close-ups that are of her face or what she\u2019s wearing on Instagram. It\u2019s not just the one best curated photo, you can see her entire day. It\u2019s why there\u2019s so many VSCO links in people\u2019s bios on Instagram. \u201cIf you want to know who I am, check out my VSCO.\u201d\n\nDoes it seem like VSCO\u2019s existence is supported by these larger, more competitive platforms? Does VSCO exist in the way that it does without being able to position itself as different from something else?\n\nYeah, absolutely. There\u2019s a ton of free editors out there. People are choosing VSCO for well beyond just the tools. We\u2019re very self-aware; it\u2019s not just about using one platform or another. We help you share your content to wherever you want to share. We\u2019re not trying to keep everything just within VSCO. And so for that, we\u2019re uniquely positioned in a way that helps you express yourself.\n\nIn some ways, does that runs contrary to this low-stress, anti-competitive nature of VSCO, that you\u2019re making it easy for people to put VSCO stuff on other platforms?\n\nNo, because again, go back to our mission and our vision: VSCO is the place where you\u2019re actually creating that content. No person just exists in one location.", "description": "\u201cA VSCO girl doesn\u2019t define everyone on VSCO.
