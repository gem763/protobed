Trump impeachment: Who's who in the Ukraine scandal 1/19 Donald Trump Accused of abusing his office by pressing the Ukrainian president in a July phone call to help dig up dirt on Joe Biden, who may be his Democratic rival in the 2020 election. He also believes that Hillary Clinton\u2019s deleted emails - a key factor in the 2016 election - may be in Ukraine, although it is not clear why. Reuters 2/19 The Whistleblower Believed to be a CIA agent who spent time at the White House, his complaint was largely based on second and third-hand accounts from worried White House staff. Although this is not unusual for such complaints, Trump and his supporters have seized on it to imply that his information is not reliable. Expected to give evidence to Congress voluntarily and in secret.

Attorney Mark Zaid said that he and other lawyers on his team are now representing the second person, who is said to work in the intelligence community and has first-hand knowledge that supports claims made by the first whistleblower and has spoken to the intelligence community's inspector general. The second whistleblower has not yet filed their own complaint, but does not need to to be considered an official whistleblower. Getty 4/19 Rudy Giuliani Former mayor of New York, whose management of the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in 2001 won him worldwide praise. As Trump\u2019s personal attorney he has been trying to find compromising material about the president\u2019s enemies in Ukraine in what some have termed a \u201cshadow\u201d foreign policy. In a series of eccentric TV appearances he has claimed that the US state department asked him to get involved. Giuliani insists that he is fighting corruption on Trump\u2019s behalf and has called himself a \u201chero\u201d. AP 5/19 Volodymyr Zelensky The newly elected Ukrainian president - a former comic actor best known for playing a man who becomes president by accident - is seen frantically agreeing with Trump in the partial transcript of their July phone call released by the White House. With a Russian-backed insurgency in the east of his country, and the Crimea region seized by Vladimir Putin in 2014, Zelensky will have been eager to please his American counterpart, who had suspended vital military aid before their phone conversation. He says there was no pressure on him from Trump to do him the \u201cfavour\u201d he was asked for. Zelensky appeared at an awkward press conference with Trump in New York during the United Nations general assembly, looking particularly uncomfortable when the American suggested he take part in talks with Putin. AFP/Getty 6/19 Mike Pence The vice-president was not on the controversial July call to the Ukrainian president but did get a read-out later. However, Trump announced that Pence had had \u201cone or two\u201d phone conversations of a similar nature, dragging him into the crisis. Pence himself denies any knowledge of any wrongdoing and has insisted that there is no issue with Trump\u2019s actions. It has been speculated that Trump involved Pence as an insurance policy - if both are removed from power the presidency would go to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, something no Republican would allow. AP 7/19 Rick Perry Trump reportedly told a meeting of Republicans that he made the controversial call to the Ukrainian president at the urging of his own energy secretary, Rick Perry, and that he didn\u2019t even want to. The president apparently said that Perry wanted him to talk about liquefied natural gas - although there is no mention of it in the partial transcript of the phone call released by the White House. It is thought that Perry will step down from his role at the end of the year. Getty 8/19 Joe Biden The former vice-president is one of the frontrunners to win the Democratic nomination, which would make him Trump\u2019s opponent in the 2020 election. Trump says that Biden pressured Ukraine to sack a prosecutor who was investigating an energy company that Biden\u2019s son Hunter was on the board of, refusing to release US aid until this was done. However, pressure to fire the prosecutor came on a wide front from western countries. It is also believed that the investigation into the company, Burisma, had long been dormant. Reuters 9/19 Hunter Biden Joe Biden\u2019s son has been accused of corruption by the president because of his business dealings in Ukraine and China. However, Trump has yet to produce any evidence of corruption and Biden\u2019s lawyer insists he has done nothing wrong. AP 10/19 William Barr The attorney-general, who proved his loyalty to Trump with his handling of the Mueller report, was mentioned in the Ukraine call as someone president Volodymyr Zelensky should talk to about following up Trump\u2019s preoccupations with the Biden\u2019s and the Clinton emails. Nancy Pelosi has accused Barr of being part of a \u201ccover-up of a cover-up\u201d. AP 11/19 Mike Pompeo The secretary of state initially implied he knew little about the Ukraine phone call - but it later emerged that he was listening in at the time. He has since suggested that asking foreign leaders for favours is simply how international politics works. AFP via Getty 12/19 Nancy Pelosi The Democratic Speaker of the House had long resisted calls from within her own party to back a formal impeachment process against the president, apparently fearing a backlash from voters. On September 24, amid reports of the Ukraine call and the day before the White House released a partial transcript of it, she relented and announced an inquiry, saying: \u201cThe president must be held accountable. No one is above the law.\u201d Getty 13/19 Adam Schiff Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, one of the three committees leading the inquiry. He was criticized by Republicans for giving what he called a \u201cparody\u201d of the Ukraine phone call during a hearing, with Trump and others saying he had been pretending that his damning characterisation was a verbatim reading of the phone call. He has also been criticised for claiming that his committee had had no contact with the whistleblower, only for it to emerge that the intelligence agent had contacted a staff member on the committee for guidance before filing the complaint. The Washington Post awarded Schiff a \u201cfour Pinocchios\u201d rating, its worst rating for a dishonest statement. Reuters 14/19 Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman Florida-based businessmen and Republican donors Lev Parnas (pictured with Rudy Giuliani) and Igor Fruman were arrested on suspicion of campaign finance violations at Dulles International Airport near Washington DC on 9 October. Separately the Associated Press has reported that they were both involved in efforts to replace the management of Ukraine's gas company, Naftogaz, with new bosses who would steer lucrative contracts towards companies controlled by Trump allies. There is no suggestion of any criminal activity in these efforts.

Getty\n\nMore recently the president\u2019s annoyance over polling numbers has prompted him to heap criticism on Fox News yet again. In the wake of the Democratic party\u2019s move to remove Mr Trump from office, a recent poll published by the network found 51 per cent believed the president should be impeached.\n\nThe same day Mr Trump took out his frustrations over the survey on Twitter, writing: \u201cFrom the day I announced I was running for President, I have NEVER had a good Fox News poll.\n\n\"Whoever their pollster is, they suck. But Fox News is also much different than it used to be in the good old days.\"\n\nHe has continued to disparage the network and its hosts in the days since, bringing up broadcaster Chris Wallace\u2019s reporting on his phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nPlacing support behind the full whistleblowers' complaint against Mr Trump, the Fox host said \u201cThe whistle blower says that there was a troubling call in which the president asked the Ukrainian president to look at, and investigate, the allegation of misdoing by Vice President Biden and his son \u2013 we now have a rough transcript of that phone call and that\u2019s exactly what happened.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, after repeated scepticism from the journalist, Mr Trump hit back on Twitter - writing: \u201cSomebody please explain to Chris Wallace of Fox, who will never be his father (and my friend), Mike Wallace, that the Phone Conversation I had with the President of Ukraine was a congenial & good one,\u201d\n\nThe president has regularly compared Mr Wallace to his father, the former CBS 60 minutes host who died in 2012. Last month the Fox newscaster is reported to have told advertisers: \u201cHe often likes to say about me, \u2018You know, I was covered by Mike Wallace, I liked him much more \u2013 to which my reaction is always: One of us has a daddy problem, and it\u2019s not me.\u201d", "description": "Donald Trump called the chief executive of Fox News to complain the coverage he was receiving on the right wing news outlet was not supportive enough, it has been reported.
