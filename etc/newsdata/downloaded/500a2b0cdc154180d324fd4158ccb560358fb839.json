A climber\u2019s physical performance is closely linked with their mental state, maybe this is why one of my favourite quotes is \u201ccontrol the controllable\u201d.\n\nMy biggest pet peeve is shaking hands with someone who wants to assert dominance by squeezing obnoxiously hard. As a matter of fact, yes, I could crush your hand, but a basic firm shake is much more civilized. When people try to grip my hand too hard, I just shake my head and think that the individual cannot control their own body.\n\nWhen people meet me, many of them want to look at my hands. What makes them so special? Are they strong? Do they look different? Could you look at someone\u2019s hands and see that they are a climber? That last one is probably a yes. Especially if you could touch them too. People are always asking if there are things I avoid doing in order to protect my hands. Some climbers don\u2019t do dishes, some have showers with gloves on, some apply pastes and ointments because they believe it will help.\n\nThere are a few common hand creams that come to mind when I think of hand care. A couple of products, ClimbSkin and ClimbOn are both used for skin repair. You apply it overnight and it\u2019s supposed to help recovery. I find they both do, slowly, and neither have adverse effects that I have noticed. Then there is Antihydral, which is a medical-grade cream that blocks perspiration.", "description": "'Take a look at a climber\u2019s hands.
