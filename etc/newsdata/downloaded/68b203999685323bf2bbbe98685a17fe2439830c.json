Now, \u201cAcademy Award winner Regina King\u201d will appear on HBO\u2019s new series, Watchmen.\n\nLost and The Leftovers creator Damon Lindelof decided to adapt the comic book, which also was the basis of a 2009 movie for HBO. King already had chosen Watchmen before she was nominated for an Oscar.\n\n\u201cThe universe has my back,\u201d King said at WarnerMedia\u2019s party for the Television Critics Association. \u201cWe shot the pilot before last year\u2019s Emmys. I had just finished the pilot and I hadn\u2019t even had an Emmy nomination for Seven Seconds yet. So I\u2019m just continuing on track, reading things and doing things that speak to me. I had no way of knowing it would be the run that it was.\u201d\n\nKing does chalk it up to something beyond herself that she went from the Emmy-nominated Netflix series Seven Seconds to an Oscar-winning movie to a new series for HBO.\n\n\u201cI know I did not make a deal with the devil,\u201d King said. \u201cI must have done something good in a past life, but it was not the plan. That the plan ended up landing this way, I could not be more grateful and more excited.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the legacy of the Watchmen comic book, by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons, that sold King on the series. She had worked with Lindelof on The Leftovers, as well as director Nicole Kassell.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have done it with just anybody,\u201d King said. \u201cIt needed to be a Damon.\u201d\n\nBeing on the same network as The Sopranos and Game of Thrones also enticed King.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked on a lot of different networks and they\u2019ve all been good to me and I\u2019ve been a part of great storytelling, but we all know HBO has this prestige that comes along with the network,\u201d King said. \u201cYou can just kind of feel like OK, they\u2019re going to make sure that it gets done and gets done well and gets done right.\u201d\n\nThe Watchmen comics and film took place in an alternate 1985 in which American history took a different path after the emergence of superheroes. There is an alternate universe in which King never became an actor and never won Emmys and Oscars. Her role on the sitcom 227 changed everything.\n\n\u201cWhen I got that job, I still wanted to be a dentist,\u201d King said. \u201cIt took that experience of being in that [show] for five years and then going to college and going, \u2018Yeah, this acting thing is for me. I think I\u2019m gonna drop out, mom. I hope you\u2019re OK with that.\u2019 She wasn\u2019t, but it all worked out.\u201d\n\nLindelof has set the HBO series in present-day 2019 and uses the parallel Watchmen world to explore issues like race. King plays Angela Abar, a police officer in a world where it is so unsafe for police that all of them wear masks. By day, Angela\u2019s cover is that she\u2019s retired from the force and runs a bakery. Secretly, she\u2019s still a masked officer.\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019s definitely much more of a skeptic,\u201d King said. \u201cI think she does not take anything for face value. There\u2019s always an ulterior motive. I think she kind of marches to that beat, whereas myself, I probably don\u2019t even think about it that hard. Whoever you are is who you are.\u201d\n\nWatchmen\u2019s diverse cast also includes African Americans Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and Louis Gossett Jr. and Thai actress Hong Chau. King says she\u2019s not shy about bringing up issues of representation with Lindelof either.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a conversation,\u201d King said. \u201cYou ask pointed questions. I try not to be concerned with if they feel uncomfortable about the question. I just want to hear the answer. From there is when trust starts to form.\u201d\n\nTo his credit, King says Lindelof has welcomed questions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not really interested in a creator who wants to be \u2018all me, I don\u2019t want anybody else\u2019s ideas,\u2019\u201d King said.\n\nNow, King hopes her Oscar win will bring more eyes onto Watchmen.\n\n\u201cI feel like those awards for me personally are good real estate to use to take to do the next thing,\u201d King said. \u201cMost people that win an Oscar or Emmy, are not just [saying], \u2018I don\u2019t have to do anything else now.\u2019 I think they\u2019re using that as cache to go into the next thing. That\u2019s kind of the point.\u201d\n\nWatchmen premieres Sunday at 9 p.m. EDT on HBO.", "description": "LOS ANGELES, Oct. 19 (UPI) \u2014 Regina King won an Academy Award earlier this year for her role in If Beale Street Could Talk.
