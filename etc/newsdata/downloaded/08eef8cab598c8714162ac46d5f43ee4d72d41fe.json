Then, I did something that would change the course of my life forever.\n\nI opened an investment account.\n\nThat sentence leaves out some embarrassing details. In reality, I cashed my paycheck, scrambled together any spare change I could find, and marched myself into the bank, slightly terrified. My anxiety didn't get any better when I heard the sound of my pockets jingling from the loose change \u2014 my life's savings at the time.\n\nThe sum total of that change? $500.\n\nFast forward 13 years later. That $500 has grown to over $300,000. (Actually, $312,918 as of my most recent net worth update, which I publish each month on my blog.)\n\nGranted, that initial sum got some help along the way. (We'll get to those details in a minute...)\n\nBut the most fascinating part about this whole journey?\n\nMy $300,000 today all stems back to that decision I made, so many years ago, to do something with my money.\n\nHow I grew $500 to $300,000\n\nWe'll get the technical details out of the way first.\n\nAt first, I was terrified of the stock market, so I kept that $500 invested in \"cash.\" Specifically, I'd invested in a Certificate of Deposit, which was earning an impressive 5% at the time.\n\nI remember vividly the intoxicating feeling of seeing my first investment returns. At the time, those returns were nothing more than $25 a year, but that didn't stop me from immediately doing the math.\n\nDigging ditches, I was earning less than $10 an hour. And yet, just because I'd chosen to invest my money, I was given a free $25.\n\nI couldn't believe it!\n\nIf $500 could take the place of me digging ditches for two and a half hours, imagine what $1,000, $10,000, or even ... $1 million could do.\n\nThis is why I say opening that investment account was the smartest decision I ever made.\n\nAs the old cliche goes, teenagers have to get a job so they can \"learn the value of a dollar.\" And yet, with that $25 of interest, I'd learned far more about the true value of a dollar than I ever did battling heatstroke as a Texas ditch-digger.\n\nSo, I made it my mission to invest as much money as possible.\n\nEventually, I worked up the courage to invest in the stock market. There, I earned even more than 5%, although I had to weather the terrifying storm of the 2008 Great Recession to do so.\n\nThrough college, I kept investing any spare cash I earned. By the time I graduated at age 23, those small contributions \u2014 nothing more than beer money here, part-time job money there, had turned into $25,000.\n\nAfter graduating college, I was offered an entry-level job in finance, making around $50,000 a year.\n\nIt was more money than I'd ever seen, but I fought the temptation to live large on my newfound salary. Instead, I remembered my mission to invest as much money as possible.\n\nI kept living frugally, and soon used my excess earnings to build something resembling a three-fund portfolio of index funds.\n\nThat first investment account helped me reach $300,000 as a 29-year-old\n\nI'll cut the story short there, because hearing about how I continued to invest a couple hundred dollars a month for years on end might get old. (If you're really curious, I've written over 150 posts about the time in my life between ages 25 and 29 on my blog.)\n\nBut rest assured, I didn't make any fantastic one-off investments, start a million-dollar business, or anything of that sort. Instead, through nothing more than steady contributions into index funds, my work's 401k, and my IRA account, that initial $500 has grown into well over $300,000.\n\nThe strategy hasn't changed, either. As a 16-year old, I lived slightly below my means and invested any leftover money I had into a CD account. As a new grad with my first \"real\" job, I simply kept up the tradition; I lived slightly below my means and invested any leftover money I had into my index funds.\n\nThe principles are the same, and that's because everything traces track to that incredible motivation I felt when I first saw that $25 of investment income deposited into my account.\n\nTeenagers aren't the only ones who can take advantage of time\n\nLook, I fully understand that the only people who can take the advice of \"invest as a teenager\" are well, teenagers. And the chances of them breaking away from Fortnite, Snapchat, or whatever the kids these days are into and reading an article about investing are hilariously slim.\n\nBut that's missing the larger lesson here.\n\nFor one, opening an investment account grants you the obvious advantage of time.\n\nOne look at a compound interest calculator is enough to prove this. If you open an investment account early enough that it will have 30 years to compound, then all it takes is $1,000 invested per month to all but ensure you turn yourself into a millionaire. (Assuming reasonable 6% to 7% annual returns.)\n\nBut in my opinion, there's an even better lesson here, one that even I have to remind myself of frequently.\n\nPutting your money to work is more powerful than we can imagine. The sooner you put that money to work, whether it's your first investment account or just adding to an existing one, the faster you show yourself the amazing effect of seeing your passive income grow.\n\nAt a certain point, it becomes an upward spiral of wealth. You investments earn more money, which shows you the power of your investments, which motivates you to invest even more!\n\nBefore you know it, you'll be writing about seeing the growth of your account from $500 ... to $1,000 ... to $100,000 ... then $300,000 and beyond.\n\nSean, who goes by \"The Money Wizard,\" is a 28-year-old blogger and financial analyst.
