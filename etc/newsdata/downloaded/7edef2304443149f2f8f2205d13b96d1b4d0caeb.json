And by that, I mean, they're not debates. They're one-minute assertions \u2026 when someone says, you know, \"You've done something awful, that's not true, respond in 30 seconds,\" you know, it's awful hard to do.\n\nO'DONNELL: But you've made a number of gaffes in the debates. In an October debate, you confused Syria with Iraq. In the September debate, you conflated Iraq and Afghanistan \u2026 When you're watching these debates, do you worry about the gaffes?\n\nJILL BIDEN: No. I don't worry about the gaffes. You know what, the American people know who Joe Biden is. I mean, if he misspeaks one word, they don't \u2014 that doesn't affect the way they're gonna vote, one way or the other.\n\nO'DONNELL: Some Democrats worry and wonder whether you'll be fast enough on your feet, quick enough, to defend yourself against President Trump.\n\nJOE BIDEN: What they're really tryin' to make the case is about age. And with age comes experience, with experience comes wisdom, and with wisdom comes judgment.\n\nWatch O'Donnell's full report this Sunday, Oct. 27, on \"60 Minutes\" at 7:30 p.m. ET and 7 p.m. PT on CBS.", "description": "Biden's wife Jill also addressed the 2020 contender's multiple debate gaffes", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/25/5755d887-053f-499b-b9a6-b2f744fdd8a1/thumbnail/1200x630/2b2c0489bc3c6a5051e41ad603f55d94/bidenfullhq.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
