And it will not impact the Bus Station\u2019s existing retailers, which have leases to conduct business at the Station.\u201d", "description": "The developer filed court papers on Monday, saying it has between $50 million and $100 million in assets, but liabilities of up to $500 million.", "authors": ["Dana Rubinstein"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/68/2f/2c2c0f734687b7fcaa70c3237df6/ap-17136648353957.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
