After wading through every possible leak imaginable the time has finally come. The Google Pixel 4 and 4 XL have been announced for real. And as an added bonus, they're both cheaper than last year's counterparts. Here's everything Aussies need to know about the new range.

Not only will they actually be wireless, the charging case looks super sleek and offers an additional 24-hours of battery life on top of the 5 that the buds get themselves.\n\nAs for the buds themselves, they at least seem to fit into the ear seamlessly. They'll also have the ability to offer real time translation, which is extremely cool.\n\nThe only real issue is that there's a huge question mark over whether they'll actually come to Australia.\n\nThey won't be out in the U.S. until Autumn 2020 and we couldn't get an answer out of Google about whether we will see them here.\n\nGoogle Pixelbook Go\n\nThe Pixelbook Go is marketed as a thin, light and affordable version of the regular Pixelbook.\n\nIt comes with 16GB RAM, 256GB storage and extra quiet 'hush keys' which seem super cool. We're also fans of the ridged bottom that's designed for improved grip.\n\nSadly we've never gotten the Pixelbook range in Australia and there is no local pricing or release date for the most recent edition. Considering that there's no embargo on coverage for the Go, it's probably safe to assume that this trend is going to continue.\n\nPerhaps we'll get it in the future, but chances aren't looking good.\n\nThe Pixelbook Go Walks The Fine Line Between High Design And Great Value The Pixelbook is the best Chromebook you can buy, but it\u2019s also one of the most expensive Chromebooks you can buy. The big pitch for the Pixelbook Go is that it takes a lot of what you like about the Pixelbook and Google\u2019s aesthetic in general, and charges only $US650 ($962). That\u2019s a damn fine idea, but my limited time with the Pixelbook Go suggests there could be a hefty Google tax for embracing it\u2019s \u201caffordable\u201d Chromebook.

Instead, the games will stream online from a remote server.\n\nusers will be able to access Stadia via a TV, PC, laptop, tablet or Pixel smart phone.\n\nMuch like Netflix and Stan, this streaming service will have a monthly fee of $US10 a month.\n\nMajor games such as Red Dead Redemption 2 and Assassin's Creed Odyssey have been announced for Stadia.\n\nAustralia definitely won't be getting Stadia in November. In fact, there is no guarantee that we will get it at all. Considering the state of Aussie internet, this isn't surprising.", "description": "Google announced a slew of new products overnight, including the long-anticipated Google Pixel 4 range and the Nest Mini.
