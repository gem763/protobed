They had also lost nine consecutive times to the Canadiens, regardless of venue. Detroit had won in overtime or a shootout on three occasions in Montreal over the previous 14 visits.\n\nTyler Bertuzzi, Darren Helm and Luke Glendening also scored, Danny DeKeyser had two assists and Jonathan Bernier made 33 saves for the Red Wings.\n\nJoel Armia and Max Domi each scored a goal and Carey Price turned aside 30 shots for the Canadiens.\n\nThe Red Wings led 2-1 after the first period.\n\nHelm opened the scoring at 13:33 following a scramble in the front of the goal after a Montreal turnover. Jacob De La Rose and DeKeyser were each credited with an assist.\n\nPrice robbed Taro Hirose with a pad save moments later and Mantha clanged a shot off the crossbar.\n\nArmia scored with 53 seconds left in the period after the Canadiens won a faceoff in the Red Wings' zone.\n\nBertuzzi put Detroit in front 30 seconds later by banging in a rebound of a shot by Dylan Larkin. DeKeyser picked up his second assist.\n\nThe Wings led 3-2 after two periods.\n\nThe Canadiens tied it at 4:34 of the period. Tomas Tatar swiped at the puck in front of the goal and it deflected off the boards and back to the front of the net, where Domi was waiting to knock it in. Jeff Petry also collected an assist.\n\nMantha scored on a power play from just beyond the right circle at 15:38 to put Detroit back on top. Dennis Cholowski fed him the puck from the left point and Mantha one-timed it for his sixth goal this season. Nick Suzuki was in the penalty box for slashing.\n\nIn the final period, Helm was stopped on a breakaway with three minutes to go. But Glendening scored an empty-net goal to clinch the victory.\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "Anthony Mantha scored the go-ahead goal late in the second period and the  Detroit Red Wings won in regulation at Montreal for the first time in 12  seasons,...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
