Fursland examines the issues for adoptive families.\n\n\u00a314.95, baaf.org.uk\n\nHowever, this doesn\u2019t mean teaching a toddler about intercourse, but rather beginning the years-long conversation by using and teaching children the correct terms for body parts - and not using nicknames.\n\nDr Borba said: \u201cUse terms like vagina and penis when they are young and it makes it so much easier. And the kids already think they can talk to mum and dad about everything.\u201d\n\nOtherwise, parents can run into the issue of making themselves appear uncomfortable, which can in turn make children uncomfortable with the topic.\n\n\u201cAs soon as you make it look like it\u2019s not natural, they are picking that up and are less likely to talk to us about the important stuff,\u201d Dr Borba explained.\n\nAfter creating a relationship where the children feel comfortable speaking to their parents about any topics, Dr Borba advises parents keep up with what their children are learning and exposed to as they age.\n\nAcknowledging that there isn\u2019t really a \u201cright age\u201d to explain sex to your children, Dr Borba said that it is about \u201cstaying one step ahead and knowing what kind of material your child is seeing\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe big thing is we wait too long or the child has misinformation that they get from a friend,\u201d Dr Borba said.\n\nTo ensure parents have the answers for when they are asked, they may consider reading and talking to other parents to gain an idea of what their children are learning, as well as reading their children's health books.\n\nDr Borba also recommends following the same rules that apply to anything - taking into consideration \u201cage, stage, and why they want to know\u201d.\n\n\u201cAnytime your child asks you a question, your first question should be \u2018tell me what you mean?\u2019\u201d Dr Borba said, as often their interpretation is off.\n\nBy allowing children the opportunity to explain what they are questioning, parents can follow their child\u2019s lead - and not worry about sharing too much before they are ready.\n\nA suggestion Dr Borba gives parents is to ask their children what \u201ctheir friends are saying\u201d about sex-related topics when they come up.\n\n\u201cThen you can say: \u2018That isn\u2019t quite right but I\u2019m so glad we had this chance to talk about it,\u2019\u201d Dr Borba told us.\n\nDuring these conversations, it is also important for parents to personalise the discussion based on factors such as interests, values and religion, as well as methods for conquering peer pressure and teaching children the importance of no means no.\n\nIf children haven\u2019t come to their parents, or parents aren\u2019t sure how to broach the topic of sex, Dr Borba recommends bringing the topic up naturally, through a movie or a magazine article.\n\nOverall, while there is no correct age to talk to children about sex, a good rule of thumb is to start younger than you\u2019d expect.\n\n\u201cMost of us think that we are going to have the big talk when they are tweens, but by that time they already know this stuff. And have probably gotten the wrong info,\u201d Dr Borba said.", "description": "When it comes to talking to children about sex, parents are often under the impression that a \"birds and the bees\" conversation carried out during their child\u2019s early teenage years will suffice.\u00a0 However, parenting experts actually advise having the conversation much earlier - and spreading it out over multiple discussions.", "authors": ["Chelsea Ritschel"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/19/20/istock-854450808-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
