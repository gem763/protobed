Maybe the XFL would find room for the most prolific passer in Football Championship Subdivision history. Hodges wasn\u2019t sure of anything other than the notion he wasn\u2019t ready to bail.\n\n\u201cHe ain\u2019t that way,\u201d Goode said Wednesday. \u201cAnd look where he\u2019s gone. He\u2019s gone from not having nothing, to having everything.\u201d\n\nOr, at the very least, a shot at everything. The player Alabama coach Nick Saban considered too small to suit up for the Crimson Tide, who is a champion duck caller in his down time, who wasn\u2019t signed after coming out of Samford last spring and only made the Steelers after performing well in a tryout, could run onto the field with the starters on Sunday night when Pittsburgh (1-4) visits the Los Angeles Chargers (2-3).\n\nWhile Mason Rudolph returned to practice Wednesday, an important step in his recovery from a frightening concussion suffered in Sunday\u2019s loss to Baltimore , Hodges worked with the starters and didn\u2019t exactly look out of place. Heady territory for the 23-year-old affectionately known as \u201cDuck\u201d by his teammates after Steelers coach Mike Tomlin dubbed Hodges \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d during offseason workouts.\n\nYes, in a way things have happened quickly. Hodges went from jobless to the practice squad to primary backup to completing 7 of 9 passes for 68 yards in the second half of a pivotal division game at Heinz Field in the span of a month. He knows his story is unlikely. At least, to everyone else but Hodges.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a crazy process, even from the beginning, coming here for a tryout,\u201d he said. \u201cI told some people before that if I play in the NFL five years, 10 years, this whole kind of story will fit who I am. It just shows (with) hard work and confidence and belief in yourself, you can accomplish your dreams.\u201d\n\nHodges talks with a bit of a twang that belies his upbringing in Kimberly, a town of about 3,000 located 20 minutes north of Birmingham. He\u2019s been throwing touchdown passes since he was 5 but when Goode arrived to take over at Mortimer Jordan in 2013, the Blue Devils were in the process of rebuilding.\n\nSo Goode asked Hodges to run the option, a decision that limited Hodges\u2019 opportunities to show off his right arm but also kept the team\u2019s defense off the field. Hodges\u2019 numbers were modest - he threw for 1,748 yards and 15 touchdowns as a senior - but the team turned a corner. Mortimer Jordan reached the playoffs that fall, the start of a rise that\u2019s made them a perennial contender in Alabama.\n\n\u201cIt was a big deal,\u201d Goode said. \u201cHe kind of helped create the foundation and we\u2019ve reaped the benefits ever since.\u201d\n\nStill, big-time colleges weren\u2019t interested in the 6-foot-1 Hodges. Goode told anyone who would listen that Hodges \u201cdoesn\u2019t measure well\u201d but played with a gunslinger mentality that reminded him a bit of Hall of Famer Brett Favre. Saban wasn\u2019t interested, telling Goode that Hodges \u201cwasn\u2019t big enough.\u201d So Hodges eventually chose to stay close to home, playing four years at Samford, just down I-65 in Birmingham.\n\nAll Hodges did over four years is set an FCS record by throwing for 14,584 yards, breaking the mark set by former Tennessee Titans star Steve McNair. Still, when the NFL draft came and went, his phone didn\u2019t ring. It stayed silent even after teams started making offers to undrafted free agents. The Steelers eventually brought him in for a look, and it didn\u2019t take long for all the mix of talent and fearlessness Goode saw back in high school to become evident.\n\n\u201cHe had this feel about him,\u201d Steelers cornerback Mike Hilton said. \u201cWe seen him make a lot of throws that probably undrafted guys trying to make a team wouldn\u2019t make.\u201d\n\nThough he played well during camp and the preseason, he got caught up in the financial realities of the NFL. The Steelers were set at quarterback with Ben Roethlisberger, Mason Rudolph and Josh Dobbs. So Hodges returned to Alabama and hung out, a man without a team for the first time in his life. It was weird. It also didn\u2019t last.\n\nPittsburgh traded Dobbs to Jacksonville on Sept. 9. Then Roethlisberger was lost for the season with an elbow injury on Sept. 14. When Rudolph fell unconscious to the Heinz Field turf on Sunday after taking a hit to the chin by Baltimore\u2019s Earl Thomas, Hodges trotted into the huddle without a care in the world.\n\nBack in Alabama, Goode was reviewing tape at the school\u2019s field house. He set his phone on a window sill - the only place it could get decent reception - and checked it every 30 minutes or so. In the middle of the afternoon, the messages came in a deluge. All of them saying the same thing: \u201cDuck is in! Duck is in!\u201d\n\nHodges led Pittsburgh to a pair of go-ahead scoring drives. Though Baltimore pulled out the victory in overtime after JuJu Smith-Schuster\u2019s fumble, Hodges - for at least two quarters - looked as if he belonged. Watching the highlights, Goode wasn\u2019t surprised.\n\n\u201cWe talk to our players, before the game is played, it\u2019s played 1,000 times in your head,\u201d Goode said. \u201cDevlin had played that game over and over. He\u2019s thrown TD passes. He\u2019s run some in. He\u2019s led them on drives. He might not have done it physically yet, but he\u2019s done it mentally.\u201d\n\nThe chance to do both could arise again on national television on Sunday night in Los Angeles, where Pittsburgh\u2019s fading chances of getting a wayward season back on track might rest on the slight but swaggering shoulders of a player nobody wanted six months ago.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got the \u2018It\u2019 factor,\u201d Goode said. \u201cHe always has.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Out of work on the first Saturday in September after getting cut by the Pittsburgh Steelers, Devlin Hodges sat in his parent's house in Kimberly, Alabama, texted his high school coach Dusty Goode and asked Goode if he wanted to come over and watch some football.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Will Graves"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/07/ravens_steelers_football_81886_c0-125-3000-1874_s1770x1032.jpg?f52fad753beb582a85b1710fc9f6c2ec1ddbd99f", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
