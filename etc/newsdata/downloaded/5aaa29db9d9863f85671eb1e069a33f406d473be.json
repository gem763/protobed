Feel free to keep score of who can tell the future most often or mock us as we go. Now, on to Week 7!\n\nJosh Allen finishes as the QB1\n\nDoes this even qualify as bold? I'm not really sure. But Allen is only 18 percent started in Yahoo leagues as of this writing, so most of you aren't treating him as a plausible QB1. It's never a passing clinic with Allen, but this week he's facing a Miami defense that allows 9.7 yards per attempt through five games, along with 14 total passing scores. Buffalo can definitely exploit this matchup. Allen has also run for three scores over five games. He has a great shot at three or four combined TDs this week, placing him squarely in the QB1 conversation. - Andy Behrens\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nOld man Witten blows through Eagles\n\nFrank Gore, Adrian Peterson, and Jason Witten \u2014 for several NFL relics, the hands of time have reversed course. This week, the Dallas tight end will continue to look youthful. It's the Eagles, after all, one of the most charitable pass defenses in the league, giving up 7.8 pass yards per attempt. Sans Amari Cooper, who's accounted for 26.9 percent of the Cowboys target share, Witten should eclipse the 50-yard mark for the fourth time in five games. Similar to what other wrinkly prunes Vernon Davis and Jimmy Graham achieved against Philly, Witten tucks well inside the position's top-10 in Week 7 with 60-plus yards and a TD. - Brad Evans\n\n[Play in Yahoo\u2019s NFL $250K Baller. $10 entry fee and $25K to first place]\n\nMichael Gallup finishes as the WR1\n\nStory continues\n\nHe\u2019s coming off a disappointing game but is top-20 in WOPR on the season while ranking fourth in yards per route run. Gallup should be busy Sunday night with Amari Cooper looking unlikely to play and Randall Cobb banged up against a pass-funnel Eagles defense that\u2019s stingy versus the rush, but has been gashed for the most fantasy points by outside wide receivers this season. Gallup is in the midst of a legit breakout, and Dallas has one of the highest implied team totals this week, so the recipe is there for him to just barely beat Cooper Kupp as this week\u2019s top scoring fantasy wide receiver. - Dalton Del Don\n\nMichael Gallup #13 and Jason Witten #82 should both deliver big games for fantasy managers against an Eagles secondary that has struggled. (Photo by Wesley Hitt/Getty Images)\n\nThe Dante Pettis breakout begins in Week 7\n\nPettis excelled down the stretch as a rookie last year, posting WR2 fantasy numbers from Weeks 12 through 15 before suffering an MCL injury in Week 16. Converting over 65 percent of his targets (with Nick Mullens under center), and flashing solid after-the-catch ability, he pulled down four TDs in his final four healthy games of the season. Assuming he\u2019d take that momentum into 2019, the 24-year-old became a #footballtwitter darling during the offseason.\n\nWhether it was a groin issue or something else, Pettis struggled to get onto the field and make an impact over the season\u2019s first three weeks. Since the Niners\u2019 bye, however, it appears as though the Washington product is emerging as a featured component in San Fran\u2019s offense.\n\nAdmittedly, his Week 6 stat line (3-45-0) is gross \u2026 but what\u2019s interesting is that his snap percentage (72%), routes run (23), and targets drawn (6) were the highest they\u2019ve been all year. With Deebo Samuel banged-up (groin), those numbers figure to translate into fantasy relevance this Sunday. Pettis will travel east to take on a Washington defense that\u2019s allowed the third-most receiving TDs (14) and the fifth-most points to opposing wide receivers. Even if you don\u2019t need his flex appeal in Week 7, his upcoming schedule makes him a solid stash as he\u2019ll face Arizona in two of his next four matchups. - Liz Loza\n\nRobert Woods finds pay dirt, finishes as a Top-5 WR\n\nHe\u2019s been complete dust thus far in fantasy. So much so that you\u2019d probably be stunned to know he\u2019s inside the top-12 in targets at the wide receiver position. The opportunity has been there for Woods overall this year. He\u2019s had two games with four or fewer targets but has been at eight or more in all others. His average depth of target (8.7) isn\u2019t much higher than perceived security blanket Cooper Kupp. The role is still there for the veteran receiver and he has some bankable positive touchdown regression coming his way soon, considering he\u2019s yet to score via the air despite all those looks.\n\nA great way to get off the map and start that pass to a normalized touchdown total: Playing the hideous Atlanta Falcons. The moribund defense blows coverages on the regular. Atlanta is the 31st-ranked pass defense in Football Outsiders DVOA, besting only the tanking Dolphins. Woods gets right with a mega-scoring affair in Week 7. - Matt Harmon\n\nMiles Sanders takes off\n\nIt\u2019s somewhat frustrating to see Sanders sitting as the RB28, what with Jordan Howard having a renaissance and the Eagles offense a little bit disappointing (come back soon, DeSean). But at least Philly has found something specific for Sanders to do \u2014 he\u2019s gobbled up 208 receiving yards over the last four games. The Cowboys have struggled to mark backs in coverage \u2014 shocking when you consider the personnel in the middle of that defense \u2014 and Doug Pederson is too smart not to notice. Sanders is in play for his first true blowup game of the year, and look for it to happen through the air, where running back targets carry much more value. Sanders is also recommended as a buy for the remainder of the season. - Scott Pianowski\n\nListen to the Yahoo Fantasy Football Podcast", "description": "Rookie Miles Sanders has flashed what made him a buzzy fantasy pick, but this could be the week that he and others we've been hoping would take off finally deliver.", "authors": ["Yahoo Sports Fantasy Staff"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/wzO82.SCMvgHeVWeQJKCXg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/naPiVaTghGScvwsMtQSwhA--~B/aD0xOTU1O3c9MjkzMztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/15440f70-f0f0-11e9-9d3f-55ac08e341ee", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
