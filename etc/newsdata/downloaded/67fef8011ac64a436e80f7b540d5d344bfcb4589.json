The EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, had told diplomats on Thursday evening that the British needed to \u201cfundamentally amend their position\u201d.\n\nA European commission spokeswoman said: \u201cWe have completed discussions with the UK for today. We gave our initial reaction to the UK\u2019s proposals and asked many questions on the legal text.\n\n\u201cWe will meet again on Monday to give the UK another opportunity to present its proposals in detail.\u201d The spokeswoman added that the proposals did not \u201cprovide a basis for concluding an agreement\u201d.\n\nAn EU official said: \u201cThe UK often asks for meetings to keep [the] process going; we agree we should leave no stone unturned. But there is nothing useful that could be done this weekend.\u201d\n\nA senior EU diplomat said: \u201cIf we held talks at the weekend, it would look like these were proper negotiations. The truth is we\u2019re still a long way from that. We need to work out quickly whether there is the opportunity to close that gap.\u201d\n\nBrussels is keenly aware of the danger that Downing Street is playing a \u201cblame game\u201d and the EU could be seen as intransigent in rejecting the talks.\n\nSources said it would not, however, pretend to negotiate when there appeared to be doubt over any basis for progress.\n\nA UK government spokesman said: \u201cWe have put forward proposals which represent a reasonable compromise.\n\n\u201cIf the EU also wants a deal, we need to work together at pace in the coming days. We are having technical discussions on the proposals with taskforce 50 again today and we are ready to continue those talks at any point to secure a deal, including through the weekend.\u201d\n\nThe UK has proposed that Northern Ireland leave the EU\u2019s customs territory with the rest of the UK on 31 October, but remain in the single market for goods.\n\nThe Northern Irish assembly, however, would retain a veto on the arrangements at the end of the standstill transition period in December 2020 and then every four years.\n\nSpeaking in Denmark, the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, said the plan did not have the support of the people of Northern Ireland.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m interested in solutions; any solution has to have the support of the people of Ireland and Northern Ireland,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s been put on the table by Mr Johnson is not supported by business or civil society in Northern Ireland; it\u2019s only supported by one political party, so there\u2019s a long way to go.\n\n\u201cDemocracy matters, and any agreement that affects Ireland deeply has to have support from people on both parts of the island.\u201d\n\nIn response to the UK government\u2019s admission in court documents that the prime minister accepted he would have to ask for an extension to Britain\u2019s membership of the EU if a deal were not secured, Varadkar said he would support such a Brexit delay.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always said that Brexit doesn\u2019t end with the UK leaving, it\u2019s just the next phase of negotiations, but if the UK were to request an extension, we would consider it. Most EU countries would only consider it for good reason, but an extension would be better than no deal,\u201d he said.\n\nVaradkar, who was speaking alongside the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said: \u201cOur focus is on securing an agreement and getting a deal at the European council summit.\n\n\u201cI believe that\u2019s possible, but in order for it to be possible, all sides have to reaffirm the shared objectives when this started two or three years ago \u2013 coming to an agreement required no hard border between Ireland, north and south, that the integrity of the single market of the European Union will be protected, and that the all-island economy will be protected.\n\n\u201cWhat we need to do is refocus on those objectives and come to an agreement by the middle of October, and I think that is possible.\u201d\n\nAfter discussions with the Northern Ireland secretary, Julian Smith, the Irish deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, said there were some grounds for hope but a deal did not seem imminent.\n\n\u201cFor the first time, the British government under Boris Johnson has now accepted that there needs to be full regulatory alignment for all goods to prevent the need for border infrastructure,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think that is very welcome progress and it\u2019s important to recognise that, because progress hasn\u2019t been easy to find in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cThe border question is about identity and emotion and history and trauma linked to partition. That it why it\u2019s so emotive, politically, and why we have to be responsible in terms of how we solve it.\n\n\u201cI believe that the British prime minister wants to get a deal this month. We will certainly work to that timeframe if the British position evolves.\u201d", "description": "Sources say PM\u2019s insistence on Ireland customs border means no basis for discussions", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey", "Jennifer Rankin", "John Crace"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/170d2c621389301488cac41e40ec333cb6ae7a23/0_105_2646_1587/master/2646.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=efe9e058e9ec8f91c64759c48e14be84", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
