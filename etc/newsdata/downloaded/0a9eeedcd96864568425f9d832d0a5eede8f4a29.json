In a statement, the department said the entities have been connected to \u201chuman rights violations and abuses in China\u2019s campaign targeting Uighurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities\u201d in Xinjiang, an autonomous region in northwest China.\n\nIn a federal register notice, the U.S. Commerce Department said the entities have been implemented in aiding China with repression, mass arbitrary detention and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs and other Muslim groups in the region.\n\nCommerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said that adding the entities to the blacklist will prevent U.S. companies from contributing to China\u2019s repression efforts of its \u201cdefenseless minority populations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe U.S. government and Department of Commerce cannot and will not tolerate the brutal suppression of ethnic minorities within China,\u201d Ross said.\n\nThe move follows the United States utilizing its time at the U.N. General Assembly last month to condemn and criticize China for its treatment of Uighurs.\n\nIt also came days before the two nations were scheduled to start high-level trade negotiations on Thursday in Washington, D.C., the White House said Monday.\n\nIn a statement to CNBC, Hikvision said it opposes being added to the blacklist, and that it has been communicating with the Trump administration for the past year over its concerns.\n\n\u201cPunishing Hikvision, despite these engagements, will deter global companies from communicating with the U.S. government, hurt Hikvision\u2019s U.S. business partners and negatively impact the U.S. economy,\u201d the company said.\n\nThe other companies added to the list are Dahua Technology, IFLYTEK, Megvii Technology, Sense Time, Xiamen Meiya Pico Information, Yitu Technologies and Yixin Science and Technology.\n\nAlong with the companies, the Commerce Department blacklisted China\u2019s public security bureau for the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region and 18 of its subordinate municipal and county public security bureaus, as well as one other subordinate institute.", "description": "Oct. 8 (UPI) \u2014 The Trump administration has added 28 Chinese security bureaus and giant technology companies to a U.S. trade blacklist over their", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
