(AP) - Draft losses and suspensions are causing depth problems for a Mississippi State defense that ranked among the nation\u2019s best last season.\n\nMississippi State already had to replace three first-round draft picks on defense and now has two more projected starters on that side of the ball serving suspensions for the majority of the season. Mississippi State\u2019s concerns on defense were apparent last week as the Bulldogs outlasted Louisiana-Lafayette 38-28 in their season opener, though Joe Moorhead also saw some cause for optimism.\n\n\u201cWe created a bunch of turnovers so I thought that was a positive,\u201d Moorhead said. \u201cWe had some new faces playing in their first start and first extended action, and I thought that was a positive.\u201d\n\nMississippi State\u2019s defense still has plenty of room for improvement heading into Saturday\u2019s game with Southern Mississippi (1-0).\n\nLinebacker Willie Gay and defensive tackle Lee Autry were among seven players suspended before last week\u2019s season opener for what the school described as a violation of team rules. The suspensions came after the school was placed on NCAA probation following an investigation into academic violations.\n\nMississippi State already was playing without defensive linemen Jeffery Simmons and Montez Sweat plus safety Johnathan Abram after all three were taken in the first round of the NFL draft. The Tennessee Titans took Simmons with the 19th overall pick, Sweat went 26th to the Washington Redskins and the Oakland Raiders took Abram one pick later.\n\nThose three first-round draft picks helped make Mississippi State one of the nation\u2019s stingiest defenses last season.\n\nA year ago, Mississippi State\u2019s defense ranked first nationally in touchdowns allowed (15) and total yards allowed (263.1 per game). The Bulldogs also ranked second nationally in points allowed (13.2) and rushing yards allowed (95.08).\n\nAgainst Louisiana-Lafayette, it was a different story. The Ragin\u2019 Cajuns collected 431 yards of total offense and 164 yards rushing, though Mississippi State did force five turnovers. Also concerning for Moorhead was a 99-yard drive the Bulldogs allowed in the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cWe got to get our cleats in the ground,\u201d Moorhead said. \u201cEntering the fourth quarter Louisiana had 14 points and under 200 yards of offense. But they had those two scores late. In all three phases we need to have that finishers\u2019 mentality and when you have them against the ropes, you got to finish that thing off. So identification and communication and a better job of tackling and being able to finish (needs improvement).\u201d\n\nMississippi State\u2019s defense has particular concerns up front. Autry was the lone interior defensive lineman returning this season with any significant experience.\n\nRedshirt freshman linemen Fabien Lovett and Jaden Crumedy made their first collegiate start against Louisiana-Lafayette.\n\nThe Bulldogs are struggling to replace the production of Sweat and Simmons, who combined for 116 tackles, 31 tackles for loss and 13.5 sacks last year. Mississippi State collected one sack and three tackles for loss against Louisiana-Lafayette.\n\n\u201cWe have to go out there and make some corrections,\u201d defensive end Chauncey Rivers said. \u201cWe have to lock in on our assignment and play hard. We have to rotate the depth this year and all we can do is get better. Come this weekend, we have to go dominate.\u201d\n\nMoorhead said the Bulldogs need to rotate more guys on the interior of the line and at linebacker.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Draft losses and suspensions are causing depth problems for a Mississippi State defense that ranked among the nation's best last season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Paul Jones"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/08/31/mississippi_st_louisiana_lafayette_82101_c0-143-3427-2141_s1770x1032.jpg?2da9f1819d70cc8364d0e36cc97d2ddc40fdce8c", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
