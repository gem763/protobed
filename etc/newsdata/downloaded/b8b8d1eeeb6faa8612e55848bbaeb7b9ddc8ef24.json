Nearly four years later, the company\u2019s market cap has more than doubled, to $US27 billion. This makes the carmaker one of the most valuable and recognisable brands in the world. Its prancing-horse logo is synonymous with sex, money, and the high life.\n\nFerrari wasn\u2019t always the global luxury brand that\u2019s now being traded in New York. The company\u2019s early days as a maker of racing cars were rather humble, and it took an Italian-American racing star named Chinetti to begin the transformation into a purveyor of glamorous supercars for the world\u2019s well-heeled. The company\u2019s success drew takeover interest, and later rivalry, from Ford \u2013 before Ferrari became part of Fiat and eventually Fiat-Chrysler Automobiles.\n\nRead more: I drove a $US475,000 Ferrari 812 Superfast to see if the sports car delivers a thrill worth the price\n\nFor many years, Ferrari artificially limited its annual production figures to preserve the exclusivity of its cars. But since its IPO in the fall of 2015, the company has steadily increased the number of cars it delivers to customers. In 2018, 9,251 new Ferraris found their way to customers around the world, an increase of 852 cars, or 10.2%, over 2017.\n\nYet even at more than 9,000 cars a year, Ferraris are still rare. Most of the company\u2019s models are supply limited in that its sales are limited not by how many people want to buy a car but by how many it can make.\n\nHere is the story of Ferrari\u2019s incredible 70-year journey.\n\nIn 1908, a 10-year-old Enzo Ferrari saw his first car race and immediately became hooked. As a young adult, Enzo was drafted by the Italian army to fight in World War I.\n\nAfter the war, Enzo had a hard time finding work in the auto business. He applied to work at Fiat but was rejected because of an abundance of unemployed war veterans. Eventually he found work at smaller automakers.\n\nFiat\n\nBy the early 1920s, Enzo landed a job at Alfa Romeo as a race-car driver. Fellow drivers at the company included legendary aces like Tazio Nuvolari, here in an Alfa.\n\nIn 1929, Enzo launched Scuderia Ferrari, or Team Ferrari. There was no car company yet: Scuderia consisted of a group of drivers who raced the cars they owned.\n\nThe team raced mostly Alfa Romeo cars. By 1933, Scuderia Ferrari had essentially become Alfa\u2019s racing division.\n\nIn 1937, Enzo shut down Scuderia Ferrari and became the head of Alfa Romeo\u2019s factory racing operation, Alfa Corse. But that wouldn\u2019t last. He wasn\u2019t happy.\n\nA week after leaving Alfa Corse in 1939, Enzo started up Auto Avio Costruzioni. The AAC 815 is the first car Ferrari\u2019s startup built on its own.\n\nAAC built two 815 cars in 1940. Both were prohibited from carrying the Ferrari name because of a non-compete agreement between Enzo and his previous employers. The agreement prohibited Ferrari from using his name in relation to races or race cars for at least four years.\n\nAlthough WWII forced Ferrari to curtail his racing activities, his company got back to work immediately following the war. In 1945, the company introduced a new V12 engine that would become one of Ferrari\u2019s signature offerings.\n\nFerrari\n\nIn 1947, Ferrari launched the 125. And since the non-compete agreement with Alfa had lapsed, this was the first car to carry the Ferrari name, establishing the company as we know it today.\n\nFerrari\n\nIn the late \u201940s, Luigi Chinetti, a successful Italian-born racing driver and a newly naturalized American citizen, approached Ferrari about the prospect of building sports cars for the public.\n\nFerrari was hesitant because his company\u2019s main purpose was to win races. At that point, the only cars Ferrari sold were for privateers. Chinetti started racing and winning in Ferrari\u2019s cars around the world.\n\nBy the early 1950s, Luigi Chinetti got the sports cars he wanted and opened the first Ferrari dealership in the US. Chinetti\u2019s showroom was located in Manhattan but was later relocated to Connecticut.\n\nFerrari\n\nThe US became a huge market for Ferrari\u2019s cars. Even today, it remains Ferrari\u2019s most lucrative market. This opened the floodgates for Ferrari\u2019s business. Legendary cars such as the California Spider.\n\n\u2026 the GTO and \u2026\n\nRM Sotheby\u2019s\n\n\u2026 the Testa Rossa soon appeared.\n\nFerrari\n\nBy the 1960s, Ferrari\u2019s cars demonstrated their prowess on and off the track.\n\nIn 1963, Ford CEO Henry Ford II jumped at the opportunity to buy Ferrari\u2019s road-car business. The deal failed after Enzo found out that Ferrari would have to ask Ford for money from Detroit to go racing.\n\nSource: Automobile\n\nIncensed by his failure to close the deal, Ford decided to beat Enzo\u2019s team at the 24 Hours of LeMans.\n\nFerrari ruled Le Mans at the time. Enzo and his team had dominated the gruelling 24-hour endurance car race \u2014 winning six times in a row from 1960 to 1965.\n\nBy 1966, Ford\u2019s challenger for Ferrari\u2019s cars was ready. The legendary GT40 was set to race at Le Mans.\n\nFord\n\nHenry Ford II got his revenge. The GT40 won Le Mans with a stunning 1-2-3 finish, ending Ferrari\u2019s dominance.\n\nFord would go on to win four years in a row, from 1966 until 1969.\n\nBy 1969, Enzo realised his company needed additional resources not only to be successful but to survive. That year, Ferrari sold 50% of the business to the company that once refused to give him a job \u2014 Fiat!\n\nEnzo Ferrari died in 1988 at age 90. But before his passing, he signed off on one final car to commemorate the 40th anniversary of his company.\n\nThe mighty F40!\n\nFerrari\n\nAfter the passing of Enzo Ferrari, longtime executive Luca di Montezemolo assumed the position of president and later chairman. Under his guidance, Ferrari was transformed into a global luxury brand during the 1990s and the 2000s.\n\nToday, the company sells its supercars for hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nNewspress\n\nAnd its hypercars for millions.\n\nFerrari\n\nFerrari also licenses everything from clothes to jewellery.\n\nThere\u2019s even a Ferrari-themed amusement park!\n\nBenjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\nClick here to read more about Ferrari World.\n\nOn the racing front, Ferrari is still one of the best in the game. The company\u2019s Formula One team \u2014 still called Scuderia Ferrari \u2014 won eight world championships between 1999 and 2008.\n\nWith its IPO, Ferrari has completed its transformation from a startup racing operation to a multibillion-dollar global brand. But true to its roots, Ferrari trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol RACE.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
