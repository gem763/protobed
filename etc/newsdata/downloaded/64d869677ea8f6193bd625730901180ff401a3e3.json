Col. Jason Rossi told c4isrnet.com that it has retired the floppy disks used on its dated 1970s computer with a \u201chighly secure solid-state digital storage solution.\u201d\n\nThe computer \u2014 called Strategic Automated Command and Control System, or SACCS \u2014 is an old system designed to receive nuclear force action messages and is considered unhackable because it predates the creation of the internet.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t hack something that doesn\u2019t have an IP address. It\u2019s a very unique system \u2014 it is old, and it is very good,\u201d Mr. Rossi said.\n\nThe Department of Defense said in 2016 it would replace the SACCS computer and \u201cupdate its data storage solutions, port expansion processors, portable terminals, and desktop terminals by the end of fiscal year 2017.\u201d\n\nThe Air Force hasn\u2019t shared whether it followed through on that promise.\n\nWhile the system is old, the Air Force says the age of the system makes nuclear launches safer, and a new computer system could jeopardize that.\n\n\u201cYou have to be able to certify that an adversary can\u2019t take control of that weapon, that the weapon will be able to do what it\u2019s supposed to do when you call on it,\u201d said Dr. Werner J.A. Dahm, chairman of the Air Force Scientific Advisory Board, in 2016.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
