I\u2019m fed up with it. I\u2019m so bored of it.\u201d\n\nDespite saying the issue \u201ckind of felt like it was getting under control here, it got better\u201d, the duke admitted recent incidents of abuse made it feel like \u201cwe\u2019re back there\u201d.\n\nHendon FC, which plays in the Southern League Premier Division South, the seventh tier of English football, works in partnership with the Brent Early Intervention Service to provide people facing mental health challenges access to its training facilities.\n\nA group of young people have formed Hendon FC Mental Health team and now take part in specially tailored weekly training sessions at the club.\n\nAs a match played in the background, the duke spoke with some of the young men who had benefited from the initiative.\n\nAfterwards, Jermaine, 24, a local hospital inpatient, said there had been a \u201cbig change\u201d in his well-being since becoming involved in the programme.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve developed a lot physically, mentally and emotionally,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s made me more stable and given me more courage to succeed in what I want to do.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to bond with new people and mix with people who are going through the same situation. It\u2019s good to learn from people and help each other.\u201d\n\nAnother programme participant Jahanzeb, 21, who has been diagnosed with psychosis and lives five minutes away from the club, said he used to live a more \u201csecluded\u201d and \u201cclosed\u201d life.\n\n\u201cI was at home a lot, I didn\u2019t want to get out of the house,\u201d he said.\n\nBut after two years on the programme, he now feels more \u201cactive\u201d and \u201csocial\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cI feel like I\u2019m more part of society now, before I was a bit bed bound, lazy. It\u2019s give me hope, motivation and confidence.\u201d\n\nThe duke\u2019s visit is part of efforts to promote the new Heads Up campaign, a joint initiative from the FA and the Heads Together charity, which seeks to raise awareness and encourage conversations around mental health \u2013 particularly among men.\n\nWilliam\u2019s visit to Hendon also coincides with the launch of new FA guidance for football coaches and managers to help them identify and provide support to players facing mental health issues.\n\nThe duke spoke with some coaches working at the club and broached the subject of racism in football.\n\nHe acknowledged the impact such behaviour also had on mental health and vowed to help tackle the issue.\n\nThe duke noted racism was an issue both in the UK and in Europe, and was\n\nheard describing the treatment of Abraham and Lukaku as \u201coutrageous\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cHeads Up is about mental health but we are going to start doing stuff on racism as well because it is affecting mental health.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot just the players but also fans.\u201d\n\nDarren Smith, who uses Hendon\u2019s facilities to run education programmes from the University Campus of Football Business (UCFB), said the issue of racism in football was \u201chuge\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt went quiet, but it never went away,\u201d he said, highlighting the way some abusers used anonymous social media accounts to \u201cnot be accountable\u201d.\n\nMr Smith added: \u201cIt can\u2019t go untouched, we need to do something about it, because football should be for all, and for certain groups to feel they are not welcome is not right.\n\n\u201cIt has an impact not only on mental health but the aspirations of our young people.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cI have a lot of students that are from minority groups, its stressful going through a degree but also what happens at the end? Am I going to be accepted into the football industry?\u201d\n\nAsked if he felt the duke took tackling the issue seriously, he said: \u201c100%. It sounds like he wants to take it further, which is great, we need more public figures, people with power or positions to take it forward.\u201d\n\nThe mental health outreach project at Hendon has been driven by Richard Hay, a support worker for Brent mental health services, who saw the need to find new ways to boost the wellbeing of the people he works with.\n\nPA", "description": "The Duke of Cambridge has highlighted the importance of tackling racism and improving mental health in football during a visit to a north London football club.
