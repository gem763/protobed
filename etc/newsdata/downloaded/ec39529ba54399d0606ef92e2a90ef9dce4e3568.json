Per the report, he explained that institutions like ING have to guard the financial system to prevent criminal activity. Because of this, concerns over Libra\u2019s potential for illegal use may result in a response from the banks:\n\n\u201cWe can take measures and exit the client, or not accept the client, so those are discussions you would have to have.\u201d\n\nMoney laundering concerns persist\n\nThe money laundering concerns are spurred by the fear that Libra may allow criminals to quickly move funds across national borders without any oversight.\n\nStill, Facebook promised not to release the asset until the organization has not eased the regulator\u2019s concerns. Hamers explained that banks such as his have a rather low-risk approach:\n\n\u201cWe are such a large, regulated institution that you don\u2019t want to risk anything. [...] We\u2019ve said we\u2019ll take a look and see how this develops.\u201d\n\nOther bankers are even less open to the idea of Libra. For instance, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has said last week that Facebook\u2019s proposed Libra stablecoin is \u201ca neat idea that will never happen.\u201d Hamers, on the other hand, noted that he thinks Libra is an initiative to learn from, not one that should be forbidden.\n\nAs Cointelegraph recently reported, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said that India \u2014 like many others, in his view \u2014 is showing a high degree of caution in regard to Facebook\u2019s Libra.", "description": "Banks may be bound to stop working with social media giant Facebook if the firm launches its Libra stablecoin, according to ING CEO Ralph Hamers", "authors": ["Adrian Zmudzinski"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvODEyMzNjY2JiYjZiYWI1NjY2M2IwYTg1MjEwNjYyNDQuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
