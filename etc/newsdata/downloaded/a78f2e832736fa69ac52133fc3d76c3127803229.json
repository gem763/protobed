Of course he is, and in many important respects even the most unruly elements of the media have behaved as what he might describe as a \u201cmodel of restraint\u201d.\n\nThe Johnson children have been left alone. His estranged wife, who has a life and career of her own, has been kept out of the coverage for the most part. A number of his past liaisons, their circumstances and consequences, have been kept confidential. Even the stories about Carrie Symonds have been remarkably straightforward. She, too, has work and ideas of her own, and is not some mere adjunct to Project Boris.\n\nWhen she has found herself to be the story, as with the police being called to a noisy incident with Mr Johnson in her flat, it was certainly not at her instigation.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

This is because they are cases where private behaviour may have had an impact, or may yet have an impact, on public policy and public funds.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t really matter if the mayor of London, as he was, nips out on his bicycle to have \u201ctechnology lessons\u201d with a model-turned-entrepreneur. That detail, though, is part of legitimate enquiries as to his relationship with Jennifer Arcuri.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Did his acquaintanceship with her make any difference with respect to various public funds for her business ventures? Would mayor Johnson have turned up to speak at various events she featured in if she was not a friend?\n\nThese are all questions that are subject to four separate enquiries and Mr Johnson has rightly pledged to co-operate with them, while stressing that he complied with the rules.\n\nRather different are the allegations made by the journalist Charlotte Edwardes, about groping, since denied by the prime minister. It may be recalled that such incidents helped end the ministerial career of Sir Michael Fallon and Damian Green, and have damaged the reputations of others, just as they should.\n\nIt is possible, at least, that they would qualify as a form of assault and, in any event, it betokens a creepy attitude that inevitably infests individuals\u2019 view of the one half of humanity that happens to be female. Mr Johnson\u2019s various writings, not always \u201cwoke\u201d, would tend to confirm his old fashioned outlook.\n\nIt is only necessary to imagine what might happen if, in some satirical parallel universe, similar things were said of Jeremy Corbyn. What would the press make of an allegation that he had arranged for some political activist to travel the world with him? Or that he had channelled public money to Palestinian causes? Or if he allowed his hands to wander beneath the table at a workshop on a new Clause IV? He would be destroyed.\n\nWhen Mr Johnson was running for the Conservative party leadership much was made of his past and he refused consistently to answer questions about it, using the formula that he did not wish to talk about matters concerning people he loves. A fair answer, but one that will not wash when his personal conduct raises questions about his public actions, his integrity and, in particular, where rules and laws may have been broken.\n\nThey are then just as worthy of journalistic enquiry as, say, the unlawful advice he offered to the Queen on the prorogation of parliament, and his threats to defy the law. Even in his position he is not above the law.\n\nMr Johnson would be well-advised to make two public statements making clear his side of things on the Arcuri and the Edwardes stories, a full and frank account that will at least suggest some willingness to face up to realities \u2013 the most important of those realities being an impending general election where the last thing that he and his party needs is for him to be dogged by these and perhaps yet more controversies.\n\nEven his friends in the press will find it difficult to ignore fresh evidence of misconduct.
