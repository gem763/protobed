However, the Eagles are more of a pass funnel defense that the Packers could exploit by letting Rodgers air it out a bit more. The Eagles, meanwhile, might want to attack a Packers defense that is a bit more vulnerable against the run game.\n\nThis might be a spot that\u2019s better suited for an in-game wager once we see which team altered its game plan to take advantage of this specific matchup.\n\nDespite 60 percent of the tickets being on the over as of this writing, the total has dropped from 48 to 46. There could be some slight value on the over. However, this could be another market to attack in-game if it appears both offensive game plans are tailored to attack weakness.\n\nPanthers at Texans\n\nOdds: Texans -4.5; 47\n\nOur projections: Texans -5.5; 45.5\n\nStory continues\n\nLast week we docked the Panthers only 2/2.5 points for the switch from Cam Newton to Kyle Allen while the market moved the line from Panthers -2.5 to Cardinals -2.5 \u2014 a full five-point swing.\n\nAfter watching some film on Allen we realized that he was definitely being undervalued, so Panthers +2.5 became one of our top bets of Week 3. But now that the public saw Allen light up the Cardinals for a 38-20 victory, it looks like the public might have over-adjusted.\n\nWe need to be very cautious about evaluating a team\u2019s offense immediately after facing a porous Cardinals defense. We have the Texans as 5.5-point favorites, which means there\u2019s some value on them at -4.5 \u2014 and this is coming from someone who was admittedly bullish on the Allen-led Panthers a week ago.\n\nThe Panthers are fairly stout against the pass, but more vulnerable against the run. Still, the Texans aren\u2019t equipped to take advantage of that with a backfield featuring Carlos Hyde and Duke Johnson. It\u2019s a bit telling that they brought in C.J. Anderson to try out this week.\n\nThis sets up as an ideal under.\n\nChiefs at Lions\n\nOdds: Chiefs -6.5; 54\n\nOur projections: Chiefs -5.5; 54\n\nWe\u2019re not going to sugarcoat it: The Chiefs are a much better football team than the Lions. Kansas City should absolutely be the favorite here, but this is a textbook case of the market simply setting an imaginary number too high.\n\nPatrick Mahomes is unstoppable, but the Lions defense is solid enough to slow him down, and their offense is more than capable of keeping up with the Chiefs at home.\n\nThe line has moved to -6.5, but the market is backing the Chiefs with 86 percent of the tickets (see our live public betting data), so the line could end up going up to 7.5 by kickoff. If that happens and cornerback Darius Slay and defensive tackle Mike Daniels are able to suit up, the Lions will be one of our favorite bets of the week.\n\nBrowns at Ravens\n\nOdds: Ravens -7; 45\n\nOur projections: Ravens -6; 45.5\n\nLast week I said it was time to buy low on the Browns. Unfortunately, as game time approached, the Browns realized they were going to be without multiple defensive backs. It\u2019s always a concern when you get a cluster of injuries like that.\n\nTo make matters worse, their play-calling was again a major issue in their 20-13 loss to the Rams. We could see coach Freddie Kitchens surrendering those responsibilities to offensive coordinator Todd Monken in the near future.\n\nWe expected the Browns to struggle early on, so I\u2019m not overreacting too much to their poor start. Getting +7 in this spot will offer some value if Morgan Burnett, Damarious Randall and Denzel Ward are all able to play this week.\n\nDaniel Jones is creating buzz. (AP Foto/Mark LoMoglio)\n\nRedskins at Giants\n\nOdds: Giants -2.5; 49.5\n\nOur projections: Giants -2.5; 49.5\n\nThe Daniel Jones era started with a bang.\n\nThe rookie led the Giants to a thrilling 32-31 victory in Tampa Bay. But anything Jones does \u2014 good or bad \u2014 is going to be amplified by the media, so I expected this line to open in the -4 to -4.5 range. The -3 opener was a bit lower than I expected, but there\u2019s some value in taking the key number +3 here, which is still available at some books as of Wednesday evening.\n\nSaquon Barkley, who is set to miss four to eight weeks, is one of the rare running backs who has a case for being worth 0.5/1 point to the spread. The Redskins are equipped to take advantage of the Giants\u2019 porous pass defense and are sneaky underdogs to back off the public\u2019s post-Jones debut sugar high.\n\nChargers at Dolphins\n\nOdds: Chargers -16; 44\n\nOur projections: Chargers -15; 44.5\n\nHere we go again.\n\nWe\u2019re showing some slight value on the Dolphins here. To be clear: The 2019 Dolphins could be one of the worst teams we have ever seen. They\u2019re in full tank mode and seem destined to land the No. 1 overall pick in the loaded 2020 draft class.\n\nBut while there\u2019s a decent chance they go 0-16, it\u2019s highly unlikely they go 0-16 against the spread. The market might have to go to great lengths to help them achieve their first cover, which could very well be this week at home against the underachieving 1-2 Chargers.\n\nOur revised approach to the Dolphins is to not back whatever team they\u2019re playing because we do think the market will overcorrect, but we can no longer, in good conscience, bet hard-earned money on a team clearly OK with losing.\n\nWe\u2019ve adjusted their team power rating to a depth I\u2019ve never seen before. To put things in perspective, the 2018 Cardinals \u2014 at their lowest point in our power ratings \u2014 would be 5.5-point home favorites and likely 1-point road favorites against the 2019 Dolphins. If you recall just how bad the Cardinals were last season, that should send chills down your spine.\n\nRaiders at Colts\n\nOdds: Colts -6.5; 45\n\nOur projections: Colts -8; 44.5\n\nLast week we made the case that the Colts, despite being without Andrew Luck, are still built to win easy matchups at home. This is one of those cases.\n\nThere\u2019s some value locking them in at -6.5 to avoid the key number of 7 \u2014 public pressure could force this line to lower by kickoff. It also appears that T.Y. Hilton (quad) could end up missing this week. Wait for him to be ruled out and see if stud linebacker Darius Leonard is able to suit up. It\u2019s possible we could get the Colts -5.5 in that scenario, which is where the value will be.\n\nPatriots at Bills\n\nOdds: Patriots -7, 42.5\n\nOur projections: Patriots -6; 44.5\n\nThis is another matchup in which the home team probably should not be getting a full touchdown. The Patriots have an insane plus-89 point differential, which ties for third -best since 1940 over the first three games. But the Bills will be the Patriots\u2019 first real test, and the winner will take over the lead in the AFC East.\n\nBookmakers floated Patriots -7.5 to open \u2014 a strategic opening number that paves the way for instant feedback on where sharps stand with a key number like 7 fully exposed on the underdog. Despite 82 percent of tickets and 75 percent of money pouring in on the Pats, the line has moved to -7 at some books while others have opted to leave it at -7.5, yet require a bit more juice to back the Bills.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty clear the sharp money has been hitting Bills +7.5 here.\n\nThis total also has some value. It opened at 44, which was right in line with our number. However, heavy action on the under has forced books to lower it to 42.5, which opens up some value on the over \u2014 especially considering the most valuable key number (43) is now exposed.\n\nWhile the public perception of this matchup being a defensive struggle makes sense on paper, the expected game flow would lean toward the over here.\n\nTom Brady and the Patriots haven't faced much competition this season. (Photo by Rich Graessle/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)\n\nJosh Allen has improved as a passer, and part of that is simply the Bills giving him more weapons. The Bills will be required to come out firing in order to hang with Tom Brady and the Patriots.\n\nOn the flip side, the Patriots haven\u2019t been pushed at all this season \u2014 they\u2019ve blown out all three of their opponents so far. If the Bills keep this close, it\u2019ll only force the Patriots to keep their foot on the gas the entire game.\n\nWe love the idea of parlaying Bills +7.5 with over 42.5. There\u2019s a stronger correlation between those two bets than people realize.\n\nTitans at Falcons\n\nOdds: Falcons -4; 45.5\n\nOur projections: Falcons -4; 46.5\n\nIt\u2019s true that the Titans are a bottom-five team in terms of our total ratings. They\u2019re a run-heavy team that relies on their defense to keep them in games, and they try to limit Marcus Mariota in an extreme game-manager role. But they could be forced into a more pass-happy, faster-paced game plan in Atlanta.\n\nThat could result in an increase in snaps for Dion Lewis as the Titans abandon their \u201cfeed Derrick Henry\u201d game plan, which will force their hand to play to the over.\n\nBuccaneers at Rams\n\nOdds: Rams -9.5; 49.5\n\nOur projections: Rams -10.5; 50\n\nThis time last year, a Rams-Bucs matchup would\u2019ve generated a total in the 56-point range.\n\nThe Buccaneers have not only improved defensively this season, but they also appear willing to rein in Jameis Winston to be more of a game manager in an attempt to prevent careless turnovers. But in this specific matchup, as 9.5-point underdogs, the Bucs might be left with no choice but to let him air it out.\n\nWith the total down to 48.5 at some books, we have a bit of value in the over. The game flow should also lend itself to that.\n\nSeahawks at Cardinals\n\nOdds: Seahawks -5; 48\n\nOur projections: Seahawks -3.5; 48.5\n\nThe Cardinals are one of the most exciting teams in the league with their Air Raid offense and No. 1 overall pick Kyler Murray, but they\u2019re still a very bad team.\n\nWe warned about overrating the 2-0 Seahawks last week because they won both games by a combined three points, and they\u2019re overrated by the market. The opening number of -3.5 has jumped to -5.5. And while this does not include very valuable numbers in 4 and 5, it might end up getting to -6, in which case we absolutely need to consider taking the Cardinals if they get to +6.\n\nVikings at Bears\n\nOdds: Bears -2; 38\n\nOur projections: Bears -2.5; 39\n\nBookmakers set what I feel was an aggressive opening line of Bears -3. Predictably, they have been flooded with Vikings tickets (73 percent) and money (87 percent). The early action has forced them to move off the key number and all the way down to -2.\n\nAs the line moves toward a pick \u2019em, it will only open up a bit more value on the Bears, whose offense is starting to show signs of life. However, this is likely a matchup I\u2019m going to pass on.\n\nJaguars at Broncos\n\nOdds: Broncos -3; 39\n\nOur projections: Broncos -3.5; 38.5\n\nYes, Gardner Minshew is a flashy rookie QB who has been one of the better surprises of 2019. However, this should be a defensive struggle and the only slight value we\u2019re seeing here is under 39, but it\u2019s not enough to trigger a bet.\n\nCowboys at Saints\n\nOdds: Cowboys -2.5; 47\n\nMy Projections: Cowboys -1; 47\n\nSunday Night Football\n\nWe made the case in Week 3 that the Saints might be able to game plan in a way that minimizes the loss of Drew Brees. They should be able to rely on their defense and Alvin Kamara\u2019s playmaking ability to keep them in this game. Teddy Bridgewater being a highly competent game manager who focuses on getting the ball to Kamara and Michael Thomas will only help the cause.\n\nIf they\u2019re able to operate a game plan similar to what we saw in Week 3 against the Seahawks, they\u2019re a great play getting the key number of +3 this week at home.\n\nBengals at Steelers\n\nOdds: Steelers -4; 43.5\n\nOur projections: Steelers -3; 43.5\n\nMonday Night Football\n\nDespite a +3 turnover margin in Week 3, the Steelers still managed to lose to San Francisco, 24-20. There is no reason to have them anything more than a 3-point home favorite against the Bengals.\n\nWe need to significantly lower our expectations for the Steelers with Ben Roethlisberger out for the season. Mason Rudolph does not look ready to fill Big Ben\u2019s shoes in a way that can get them back into the playoff hunt. We\u2019re also speculating that Devlin Hodges could make some starts at some point this season.\n\nThe time to fade the Steelers is now while the public is still willing to back them.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Here are the projected spreads and over/unders for every Week 4 game to identify the best bets.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/JkBJlplC0A4KClTSrYtDkw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/T2xslHtxIGBXxOys5XVL6g--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9Mjk5OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/864d7030-dd68-11e9-af5a-786ba36cade9", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
