I would rather see a range where you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to get, but it\u2019s going to taste amazing whatever it is.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAnother person said, \u201cYou would THINK, if they were going for unity, that all of the types would be interspersed instead of segregated (from light to dark, no less).
