Wimbledon said they would launch independent investigations into the FA charges.\n\n\"Given the seriousness of this breach in regulations, the club has decided to suspend Wally with immediate effect,\" the club said. The suspension will allow \"the club and Dons Trust boards to look at the allegations more closely and make a further announcement in due course.\"\n\nAn FA spokesperson added that Downes has until 4 October to respond to the charge. The former midfielder - a part of the Crazy Gang era of the 1980s - guided Wimbledon to a 20th-place finish last term, and his time at the club got off to a troubled start after he was forced to apologise over historic homophobic tweets.\n\nLast year Kick It Out expressed concern at a message from Downes which sarcastically praises India for legalising gay sex.", "description": "Wally Downes was immediately suspended by AFC Wimbledon on Tuesday after being hit with eight charges of gambling breaches by the Football Association.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/CeIHDluXBqPq82XmIj5RBQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KNT5q.kl9ngLSv15HGK9qQ--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/50d719cc4fa56ae725b386cb48c4f60a", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
