She was 19, younger than any previous U.S. Drag Race competitor. She hadn\u2019t even been doing drag for a year by the time she got onto the show. And she had a girlfriend, as she admitted almost right away, although later clarified during a heartfelt painting session that she\u2019s not straight, but in fact queer. Judging by the rest of the queens\u2019 squealing and gagging, you\u2019d have thought RuPaul had walked into the room.\n\nYet Scaredy won the first mini-challenge of Drag Race U.K., and the world (or at least this humble recapper) somehow fell for a cat-faced queen who had never performed a lip sync, brought us story-forward runway looks, and always seemed to be shitting herself. Scaredy spoke to me the morning after her episode two elimination, but you wouldn\u2019t even know it \u2014 she was just excited to get the music video for \u201cBedroom Queen,\u201d made with her bio-queen girlfriend Pussy Cat, into the world. \u201cI haven\u2019t actually watched [the episode] yet, \u2018cause you know, the old anxiety,\u201d she admitted. Positive vibes only!\n\nWhat was it like having to keep what happened on the show from Pussy?\n\nIt was obviously very difficult being on the show without her, but you\u2019re allowed to tell one person, so obviously, I told Pussy as much as I am allowed to tell her. [Laughs.] But we\u2019re a team, so I know, she knows, basically. It\u2019s that easy.\n\nGoing on the show, did you think that having a girlfriend, not necessarily being gay, would be such a big deal?\n\nYeah, I thought that the other queens were gonna properly hate me! But I think they actually were all okay \u2014 I\u2019m sure a few of them probably do behind closed doors, but to my face they were very nice. But I never thought that it would be a massively big deal to the public. I didn\u2019t think there was going to be so much controversy around it, but I also didn\u2019t think there was gonna be so much positivity. I just thought people weren\u2019t really gonna give a shit \u2014 and I\u2019m sure a lot of people don\u2019t, but for those that do, that\u2019s all good fun, that\u2019s fine with me. I\u2019m just being me.\n\nSo what made you decide to bring it up, it seemed like as soon as you walked in the door?\n\nI just wanted to get it off of my chest, let everyone know what they\u2019re dealing with. And I thought it\u2019s an interesting little thing, and it shows drag isn\u2019t just confined to gay men.\n\nI think the other thing that shocked a lot of people was that you had only done drag for a little less than a year. I don\u2019t think we ever got to fully find out how you first started.\n\nObviously watching the show was a big influence, but I used to look at people like Eddie Izzard as a kid, and people like Grayson Perry, and be like, oh, they\u2019re doing this different thing that intrigues me and scares me at the same time. And then eventually, because me and my girlfriend, we do art together, we thought, why don\u2019t we just create some characters to go in our weird, arty world?\n\nFrom there, what made you decide to audition for Drag Race U.K.?\n\nI always wanted to get on the U.S. one, \u2019cause I thought it would be really fun. And then it came to the U.K. and I was like, \u201cOh, I think I\u2019m gonna do it.\u201d And Pussy was like, \u201cNo you\u2019re fucking not, of course you\u2019re not, you\u2019re not ready for that, no one\u2019s ready for that let alone you.\u201d But I did it anyway and got on it, some-fucking-how.\n\nI have to tell you, I absolutely fell in love with Kitty Rouge on the runway. Where did that side-character come from, with the French accent and all of that?\n\nI kind of just came up with it at the time \u2019cause I knew it would be funny. And I thought, Bond girl, it\u2019s a bit of a dodgy part isn\u2019t it? A lot of sexism and misogynistic stuff going on with all the James Bond films. So I was like, why don\u2019t we just blow that up and play up the whole sex thing, the French thing, we\u2019ll just go with it. Is she a villain, is she not, what\u2019s she gonna do? I just thought it would be a bit of a laugh.\n\nAlso on that episode, you reminded us that that was your first time ever doing a drag performance, a lip sync. What did that feel like for you?\n\nIt was amazing, it was really crazy. I was just focusing on, \u201cDon\u2019t fall off the stage, don\u2019t throw up, don\u2019t pass out, don\u2019t look at RuPaul, it\u2019s gonna be okay, just have fun. Throw yourself around and some people might think it\u2019s funny.\u201d [Laughs.]\n\nDon\u2019t shit yourself.\n\nDon\u2019t shit yourself \u2014 or do, \u2019cause apparently people quite like it! [Laughs.]\n\nAt the beginning, you were telling me that you\u2019re excited to now show everyone what you and Pussy can do together. Being so young, what are your drag aspirations?\n\nSo I\u2019d call it more of an art aspiration, I guess, because that\u2019s what me and Pussy do mainly. We\u2019ve just released our first music video, it\u2019s on YouTube right now, and we\u2019ve got a couple more of them to come. We wanna do our art exhibition that we\u2019ve been working on for a very long time, which we\u2019ve only done one time. And we wanna try to make art a bit more fun and accessible and interesting, and for it to say things and change things, unlike most of the art nowadays \u2014 to be honest, it\u2019s a bit shit.\n\nAnd one last question: What\u2019s your advice for someone who is just starting drag?\n\nJust don\u2019t give a shit. Just do what you wanna do and be who you are, and people who are gonna stand in your way, they\u2019re just bloody obsessed with you, and that\u2019s a good thing \u2014 any attention\u2019s good attention. And promote a message, and think about what you wanna change in the world. But mainly, don\u2019t give a shit.", "description": "The \u201cbaby queen\u201d talks going on RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race U.K. with less than a year of drag experience under her belt, giving her first ever lip sync performance on the show, and how the contestants reacted to the revelation that she has a girlfriend.", "authors": ["Justin Curto"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/17/17-scaredy-cat-chaat-room-silo.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
