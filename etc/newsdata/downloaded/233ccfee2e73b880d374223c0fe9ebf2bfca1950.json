It is CareerTrackers\u2019 official airline and has been a great supporter of the organisation from the very beginning.\n\nFavourite destination\n\nI have been fortunate enough to spend time on Nyul Nyul country in the Kimberley with the traditional owners. It\u2019s a magical place where Uncle Bruno shows you how to live off the land in traditional ways \u2013 fishing, collecting native bush foods and sourcing fresh water.\n\nFavourite airport\n\nAny airport in Australia. We are lucky that our airports run smoothly, security screening is quick (most of the time) and you can be sure that your bags will arrive when you do.\n\nIf I ran my own airline I would...\n\nI would take a more holistic approach to catering and provide fresh and healthy food that leaves passengers feeling energised when they got off the plane. I firmly believe that eating well fuels your body and your brain.\n\nWhere would you go with an unlimited travel budget?\n\nI would trek from the top of the African continent to the bottom over the course of 12 months. Along the way, I would spend as much time as I could in the elements taking in the amazing wildlife in each country. I would love to trek in Rwanda and visit the gorillas.\n\nThe mountian gorillas of Rwanda are high on Michael Combs' must-see list. AP\n\nWorst place you\u2019ve been lost\n\nI was on my daily run in Mexico City recently when I took a wrong turn and ended up a long way from my hotel. I run every day to keep my mind clear and focused, but it\u2019s easy to get lost in the moment. Mexico City is beautiful, but if you\u2019re not paying attention you can find yourself in a dodgy-looking side street.\n\nBest trip ever\n\nMy husband and I went to Bhutan and trekked overnight to the Bumdra Monastery. The vibrant culture of this part of the world is something I will never forget. We sat with one of the monks and listened to him chant, pray and carry on traditions that have been passed down for many generations.\n\nMost memorable overseas dining\n\nDuring the same trip, we were invited to drink a traditional tea called butter tea. I was expecting something similar to bulletproof coffee, but this was very much a different culinary experience and not a pleasant one.", "description": "CareerTrackers\u2019 founder Michael Combs enjoys nothing more than planning a trip.
