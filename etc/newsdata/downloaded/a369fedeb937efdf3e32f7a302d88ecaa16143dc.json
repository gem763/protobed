Jean-Christophe is, as his name suggests, a descendant of Napoleon Bonaparte, while his bride is an Austrian countess.\n\nDara reportedly owns a \u00a32 million flat close to the Clerkenwell offices of her company, but she \u2018co-parent rotates\u2019 another flat in London with Edo. It means Wolfie has a place of his own before he\u2019s even at school. He stays at the property with either Edo, Dara, a nanny or sometimes Beatrice herself to care for him.
