It\u2019s the right instinct.\n\nConservative critics said Zuckerberg\u2019s words were laudable but that right-wing groups were too often censored on the site. Progressive critics, on the other hand, said that Facebook allows too many harmful posts.\n\nThe second group of critics has been more vocal. Democratic presidential candidates Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren joined in, complaining that Facebook runs false and misleading ads from their opponents. Civil rights groups were especially angry at Zuckerberg\u2019s reference to Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s \u201cLetter from a Birmingham Jail\u201d as an example of how free speech had aided the cause of justice. Bernice King responded by posting a picture of her father\u2019s assassination, writing that disinformation campaigns by politicians had \u201ccreated an atmosphere\u201d for it.\n\nSherrilyn Ifill, the president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, wrote in the Washington Post to echo King\u2019s point: J. Edgar Hoover and others had engaged in \u201chate-fueled disinformation campaigns\u201d against the civil rights movement. She also argued that Facebook does too little to stop posts that discourage minorities from voting. She concluded, \u201cThe civil rights movement was not fought to vindicate free speech rights under the First Amendment.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg, of course, didn\u2019t say that it had been. He said that free speech had helped the movement to succeed. That free speech was also deployed against the movement, sometimes to dangerous effect, does not refute the point. King and Ifill, like Zuckerberg, are implicitly asking us to consider a counterfactual scenario in which U.S. law and custom in the 1950s and 1960s had been less protective of free speech.\n\nIn that situation, would a benevolent and wise central authority have kept Hoover from spreading lies about King? It seems much more likely that Hoover and his allies would have been the central authority censoring their foes.\n\nThe risk that power will be misused is also why Warren and Biden are wrong to ask Facebook to adjudicate politicians\u2019 claims. The truth or falsity of those claims is very often disputed. Consider the track record of fact-checkers. The Post\u2019s recently slammed Senator Bernie Sanders for exaggerating the number of bankruptcies that are caused by medical bills. (I also think Sanders is wrong.) Would our political debate really be improved, though, if Facebook refused to broadcast Sanders\u2019 argument or slapped a \u201cfalse\u201d rating on it? I doubt it: A Facebook that took such action would be likely to squelch too much true and valuable speech.\n\nAnother veteran of the civil rights struggle, Walter Fauntroy, was once asked how the movement had eventually been able to effect rapid change. \u201cAlmighty God and the First Amendment,\u201d he replied. That doesn\u2019t mean Facebook should follow an anything-goes policy, and it doesn\u2019t. But it does mean that the company should err on the side of allowing too much speech rather than too little.\n\nTo contact the author of this story: Ramesh Ponnuru at rponnuru@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Tobin Harshaw at tharshaw@bloomberg.net\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nRamesh Ponnuru is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.
