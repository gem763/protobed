Sadly, the Windy City is also one of the most violent hotbeds in the nation. During Labor Day weekend, 25 people were shot. Seven died from their injuries. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (R) used the example to show, once again, why disarmed law-abiding Americans is a bad idea.\n\nGun control doesn\u2019t work. Look at Chicago. Disarming law-abiding citizens isn\u2019t the answer. Stopping violent criminals\u2014prosecuting & getting them off the street\u2014BEFORE they commit more violent crimes is the most effective way to reduce murder rates. Let\u2019s protect our citizens. https://t.co/znHO31gDH2 \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) September 2, 2019\n\nNaturally, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot didn't like the insinuation. Instead of talking about her city's failed gun control policies, Lightfoot immediately blamed \"states dominated by coward Republicans,\" for guns coming from outside Illinois.\n\n60% of illegal firearms recovered in Chicago come from outside IL\u2014mostly from states dominated by coward Republicans like you who refuse to enact commonsense gun legislation. Keep our name out of your mouth. https://t.co/yVM4JHL3xy pic.twitter.com/pr613A3dpf \u2014 Lori Lightfoot (@LightfootForChi) September 3, 2019\n\nWhen @tedcruz and the @gop dismiss common sense gun policies, they disrespect victims and their families, who deserve to live without pain and fear. \u2014 Lori Lightfoot (@LightfootForChi) September 3, 2019\n\nSecond Amendment advocate Dana Loesch took Lightfoot to the woodshed, using local Chicago reporting to refute the mayor's so called \"facts.\" Loesch pointed out the biggest flaw in Lightfoot's argument: it doesn't matter where prohibited possessors obtain their firearms. They're still obtaining the firearm on the black market in an illegal fashion.\n\nAnd the superintendent of your PD said that it\u2019s \"1400 repeat offenders driving this gun violence\u201d https://t.co/EreMXOcw6I and that your courts keep cycling them through. Instead of fighting with a Texas senator, what are you going to do about what is driving your crime rate? https://t.co/QyCMewBuan \u2014 Dana Loesch (@DLoesch) September 3, 2019\n\nThose repeat offenders are already prohibited possessors \u2014 meaning it doesn\u2019t matter where or which black market they obtain their weapons from, it\u2019s all still illegal, @LightfootForChi . So what \u201ccommon sense\u201d legislation will improve your justice system, Mayor? \u2014 Dana Loesch (@DLoesch) September 3, 2019\n\n\"Gun offenders get slaps on the wrist in this city - and it has to stop. I need our judicial partners and our state legislators to help me close this gap\u201dhttps://t.co/EreMXOcw6I\n\nWhat \u201ccommon sense gun legislation\u201d fixes rotten judges? Reduced charges? \u2014 Dana Loesch (@DLoesch) September 3, 2019\n\nAnd it doesn't help when repeat offenders are slapped on the wrist with reduced charges. If anything, this sends a message to criminals. It tells them that it's okay to commit crimes, especially if it involves a firearm, because they'll get a reduced sentence.\n\nClassic example of ridiculous sentencing in Chicago allowing repeat offenders to drive gun homicide: Felon fires off gun in public prosecutors let him plead guilty to a reduced charge of unlawful use of a weapon & dropped two counts of felony possession. https://t.co/k6AsaEQ0Xz \u2014 Dana Loesch (@DLoesch) September 3, 2019\n\nHere\u2019s another one for you, Mayor @LightfootForChi : \"Repeat gun offender, free on bail for gun possession, is charged with murdering teen in drive-by\u201d https://t.co/iyDggj6Ybx\n\nPerp was released early from his SECOND felony gun conviction. \u2014 Dana Loesch (@DLoesch) September 3, 2019\n\nMore for you, Mayor @LightfootForChi : \"University of Chicago Crime Lab looked at 2016's increase in bloodshed, it found that about 80 percent of homicide victims had a prior arrest, and almost 30 percent had a prior gun arrest.\u201d https://t.co/i7GgnNVthx \u2014 Dana Loesch (@DLoesch) September 3, 2019\n\nThe reason Mayor @LightfootForChi was so rude responding to @SenTedCruz is because acknowledging Chicago's widely reported problem with repeat offenders and light sentencing lays bare that this is a a problem with her and her party\u2019s leadership \u2014 NOT law abiding gun owners. \u2014 Dana Loesch (@DLoesch) September 3, 2019\n\nLet's be clear: Lightfoot is ashamed of the violence in Chicago. If her city's gun control policies were truly working, then Democrats would repeatedly point to Chicago as an example of why \"common sense gun laws\" are needed across the nation. But they don't. In fact, any time a law-abiding gun owner mentions the violence in Chicago, it's like we're supposed to omit Chicago from the discussion. It's like we're supposed to completely ignore the continual issues the city has.", "description": "On point..09/03/2019 23:43:47PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/62/e83c9c4d-f97a-4324-9281-1729ef243235.jpg"}
