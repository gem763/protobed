(Aly Song/Reuters)\n\nTHE KEY\n\nHuawei is increasingly looking to Europe to challenge U.S. officials\u2019 claims that it could be a rogue agent for Beijing surveillance that shouldn\u2019t be trusted to build next-generation 5G wireless networks.\n\nEuropean nations have balked at joining the Trump administration in imposing an all-out ban on Huawei, even as they\u2019ve imposed stringent security testing and other requirements and contemplated barring the Chinese telecom firm from certain sensitive portions of 5G networks.\n\nAnd while most European nations haven\u2019t given a final sign-off on Huawei\u2019s security, telecom carriers there have already contracted with the company to build portions of 5G networks in parts of England, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and Sweden, Vincent Pang, the company\u2019s senior vice president and director of the board, told me.\n\nMany of those contracts deal only with peripheral portions of the network that officials say pose a lower risk for surveillance or sabotage. But some of them include the network core, which U.S. officials say is far more concerning. Pang declined to say which nations have which contracts.\n\nNow, Huawei is hoping Europe\u2019s trust-but-verify model will provide a counterbalance to the United States, convincing other nations that Huawei is a responsible provider of 5G infrastructure. And, once Huawei is a trusted 5G supplier in Europe, that may one day even prompt the United States to reconsider its blanket condemnation, Huawei officials hope.\n\n\u201cWe're hoping that these activities will help inform the United States to have a more comprehensive approach,\u201d Andy Purdy, chief security officer of Huawei\u2019s U.S. division, told me. \u201cHopefully the kinds of things they come up with [in Europe] may be the kind of things that, in the long term, can address the U.S. government concerns.\u201d\n\n5G\u2019s super-fast networks will carry orders of magnitude more data than previous generations of wireless systems and connect far more deeply into critical infrastructure such as hospitals, airports and energy plants. That offers a trove of new opportunities for commerce and research but also poses huge risks if an adversary nation can spy on or sabotage those networks, U.S. officials warn.\n\nAnd with China\u2019s Communist Party intent on stealing U.S. companies\u2019 secrets, they say, it\u2019s simply not safe to give a company that is beholden to that government a prime spot in 5G.\n\nHuawei, meanwhile, has fiercely maintained it has never assisted Beijing in carrying out malicious activities and would refuse to do so if asked.\n\n\u201cWe have been totally transparent and totally explained to them the situation,\u201d Pang told me. \u201cWe have never received any order or requirements from the central government of China either to install any backdoors or to take any data back to China.\u201d\n\nEven in Europe there are still a lot of hurdles to overcome, however.\n\nFirst off, Huawei had to rejigger its 5G products after the Trump administration barred U.S. companies from supplying the firm with software and other components in May. That order came the same day the Trump administration officially banned Huawei from U.S. 5G networks.\n\nHuawei is prepared to ship to customers about 400,000 5G components that don\u2019t contain U.S. parts, Pang told me. But analysts suspect those reconfigured components may not offer the same speed and quality as the earlier generation, as my colleague Jeanne Whalen has reported, and the changes will prompt new rounds of testing.\n\nTrump has signaled he may roll back parts of the U.S. Huawei ban as part of a broader trade deal with China. But Huawei hawks in Congress have savaged the idea and even introduced legislation that would block it.\n\nOn Huawei\u2019s side, the company would happily shift back to using some U.S. components if the ban were loosened, but isn\u2019t counting on that happening, Pang told me.\n\nThere could also be new revelations from ongoing security audits. The European Union completed a public audit that stopped far short of warning against Huawei earlier this month, but a privately circulated report laid out far greater concerns about the company, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nYou are reading The Cybersecurity 202, our must-read newsletter on cybersecurity policy news.

(Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nPINGED: President Trump withheld $400 million in military aid to Ukraine in part to compel the government to investigate a baseless conspiracy theory that the country was involved in hiding a Democratic National Committee server from U.S. investigators, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said, my colleagues John Hudson and Karoun Demirjian reported.\n\nThe comments, which Mulvaney later backpedaled, marked a stunning admission as House Democrats' impeachment investigation hoes in on whether Trump conditioned Ukrainian aid on the nation investigating the bizarre consiparcy theory and also the family of his 2020 rival former vice president Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cDid he also mention to me the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely. No question about it,\u201d Mulvaney said. \u201cThere's going to be political influence in foreign policy \u2026 That\u2019s going to happen. Elections have consequences.\u201d\n\nMulvaney called the decision \u201cabsolutely appropriate,\"\n\nThe ex-congressman later walked back his comments, saying \u201cLet me be clear,...there was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election. There was never any connection between the funds and the Ukrainians doing anything with the server . . . there was never any condition on the flow of the aid related to the matter of the DNC server.\u201d\n\nThe initial comments refer to a bizarre conspiracy theory Trump has endorsed suggesting the DNC faked the 2016 data breach that helped propel Trump into office and that U.S. intelligence agencies have uniformly said was conducted by Russian spies.\n\nSenate Finance Committee ranking Democrat Ron Wyden (Ore.). (Susan Walsh/AP)\n\nPATCHED: Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) wants corporate executives who play fast and loose with the security of Americans' data to face prison time and harsh fines. A new bill released by the tech and security hawk yesterday would empower the Federal Trade Commission to impose those punishments as well as establish \u201cminimum cybersecurity and privacy standards\u201d for companies that handle consumer data.\n\nRight now, the FTC can sue companies after a data breach if they didn't have adequate cybersecurity standards, but it can't outline what those standards are up front. And it can\u2019t impose penalties unless companies violate an earlier agreement with the agency to clean up their act. Wyden's bill would allow the agency to go after first-time offenders.\n\n\u201cMark Zuckerberg won\u2019t take Americans\u2019 privacy seriously unless he feels personal consequences,\u201d Wyden wrote in a statement, taking a shot at the Facebook CEO.\n\nThe \u201cMind Your Own Business Act\u201d also advances the idea of a national \"Do Not Track System\u201d allowing consumers to opt out of data tracking. Companies would have to provide privacy friendly alternatives for a reasonable fee.\n\nPrivacy legislation has stalled in Congress despite ongoing bipartisan concerns over tech companies\u2019 mishandling of consumer data. A more moderate privacy bill, which does not include jail time for CEOs or allow for states to introduce their own privacy laws, was endorsed by moderate Democrats in the House this week.\n\nA Russian national flag flies on top of the Kremlin. (Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg News)\n\nPWNED: The Russian hacking group accused of compromising DNC servers in 2016 has resurfaced, attacking victims including three European ministries of foreign affairs, researchers at the Czech security firm ESET report.\n\nCybersecurity investigators long thought the group had curtailed operations but it actually just got better at hiding its work, ESET reported. The targets also included the Washington embassy of an E.U. county. Hackers were likely looking to steal sensitive documents and emails, lead researcher Matthieu Frou told Thomas Brewster at Forbes.\n\n\u201cOur new research shows that even if an espionage group disappears from public reports for many years, it may not have stopped spying,\u201d the researchers wrote.\"[Russian hackers] were able to fly under the radar for many years while compromising high\u2011value targets, as before.\u201d\n\nPUBLIC KEY\n\n\u2014 Cybersecurity news from the public sector:\n\nSenate panel finds consumer agency accidentally disclosed personal data of thousands The Senate Commerce Committee on Thursday issued a report that found the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) failed to properly handle the data of thousands of consumers, leading to an accidental data breach.
