But he said that based on membership growth and price growth, its earnings per share could climb 12% to 14% next year.\n\nHe argues that its earnings are growing much faster than the rest of the market, but its valuation looks much lower.\n\n\"Cigna will generate, next year, $8 billion of free cash flow. It's buying back 3 or 4% of the company annually and sells a seven half times estimated earnings,\" he said.\n\nWhile the company spent heavily to complete its recent purchase of pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts, Cooperman added that its debt to capital ratio should improve soon.\n\nWPX Energy\n\nLast month oil and gas driller WPX Energy announced a large stock repurchase and said it believes it will start generating free cash flow over the second half of 2019. Cooperman said that was a very positive development and praised Chairman and CEO Rick Muncrief.\n\n\"I think they'll be a constant buyer of their own stock,\" he said. But the stock, in his view, is trading at about half of the company's net asset value.\n\nHe said there is likely to be consolidation in the industry and that its share price doesn't reflect that, either. Cooperman said there is a big gap between the value an acquirer might pay for WPX and the value of the stock, and he likes to find companies that have a substantial gulf between their stock private and that \"private market value.\"\n\nRead more:The chief strategist at $1.5 trillion Prudential Financial told us which sectors she's targeting to beat a stock market that looks 'overbought'\n\nNew Media\n\nCooperman also said he owns a substantial chunk of New Media Investment Group, the company that is preparing to buy USA Today publisher Gannett\u2014 a deal he said \"has a very asymmetric reward-risk.\"\n\nIn the meantime he said the stock is very inexpensive compared to its potential returns because it's in the print media business.\n\n\"The pro forma of this company is $4 billion of revenues, $4 of earnings per share, a probable dividend of $4 in 2022,\" he said.\n\nWhile he acknowledged the problems print journalism faces, Cooperman said New Media is already getting one-fourth of its revenue from digital operations, and that revenue is improving. He also praised the company's management and noted that the company's management is buying the stock.", "description": "All three of Cooperman's choices are in relatively unpopular sectors: health care, energy, and print media.", "authors": ["Marley Jay"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5b85ca282154a340008b5610-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
