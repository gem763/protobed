Local agencies also were helping with the rescue.\n\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Update?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Update</a> Evacuations of the Golden Ray\u2019s crew continue.

Petty Officer 3rd Class Ryan Dickinson said it isn't clear whether weather conditions caused the ship to lurch. Hurricane Dorian brushed past the Georgia coast last week on its path north.\n\nThe cause of the incident remains under investigation.\n\nThe Golden Ray is flagged out of the Marshall Islands and was headed to Baltimore, Md., according to the website vesselfinder.com. The ship's registered owner is a South Korean company.\n\nOfficials say there is a fire on board the disabled cargo vessel. (The Associated Press)\n\nThe Port of Brunswick is currently closed to vessel traffic, with an established emergency safety zone in St. Simons Sound. Vessels are not authorized within a half mile of the Golden Ray, which was lying on its side.\n\nThe port is one of the busiest U.S. seaports for shipping automobiles. Nearly 614,000 vehicles and heavy machinery units moved across its docks in the 2019 fiscal year that ended June 30, according to the Georgia Ports Authority.", "description": "The U.S. Coast Guard says rescuers are searching for four crew members of a cargo ship that overturned and caught fire near a port on the Georgia coast.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5275289.1567956773!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/georgia-cargo-ship.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
