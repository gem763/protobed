The Kentucky Republican has condemned obstructionism after mastering the fine art of obstructionism; he\u2019s stressed the virtues of bipartisanship after becoming the most partisan congressional leader in modern history; he\u2019s demanded that senators treat Supreme Court nominees fairly after spearheading an unprecedented blockage against a qualified, compromise Supreme Court nominee.\n\nAnd this morning, according to a Congressional Quarterly transcript, McConnell stood on the floor of the Senate and condemned a productive House Democratic majority for taking \u201ca one-year vacation.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, I think it\u2019s pretty clear our Democratic colleagues do not have a great affinity for President Trump, but the country cannot afford for Democrats in Congress to take a one-year vacation from any productive legislation just because they\u2019d rather obsess over impeachment.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump, who\u2019s deeply invested in labeling the opposition party \u201cDo-Nothing Democrats,\u201d was delighted with the comments, though those who take reality seriously should be far less impressed.\n\nLast week, for example, the Democratic House majority passed another election-security bill, the second legislative effort on the issue to pass the lower chamber this year. It was the latest in a series of examples of the House advancing legislative priorities, despite the ongoing investigations into Trump\u2019s many scandals.\n\nIndeed, as regular readers know, in every Congress, the House majority leadership, regardless of which party is in control, sets aside the first 10 available bill numbers. It\u2019s intended as a symbolic way to signal a party\u2019s top legislative priorities: H.R. 1 through H.R. 10 will reflect the leadership\u2019s most important goals.\n\nSo far this year, the House Democratic majority has passed its democracy-reform package (H.R. 1), the Equality Act to expand civil rights to LGBTQ Americans (H.R. 5), the Dream and Promise Act (H.R. 6), the Paycheck Fairness Act to address pay disparities between men and women (H.R. 7), a bill to expand background checks on gun purchases (H.R. 8), and a bill to address the climate crisis (H.R. 9).\n\nHouse Dems have also passed bills to lower prescription drug costs, expand the Violence Against Women Act, and expand the Dream Act for young immigrants.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s McConnell\u2019s GOP-led Senate.\n\nI\u2019m reminded anew of an observation David Bernstein raised in the spring, when he asked why the Senate doesn\u2019t bother to legislate.\n\nBarring something unexpected, this Tuesday will mark two months since the U.S. Senate held a roll call vote on passage of any type of legislation. That was a joint resolution to nullify President Donald Trump\u2019s declaration of a national emergency at the Mexican border (which Trump later vetoed). It\u2019s been three months, as of Sunday, since the Senate last took yeas and nays on a genuine, full-fledged bill\u2026. The United States Senate, that great deliberative body, has effectively ceased legislating this year. It has shut down. Closed for business until 2021.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) complained over the summer that McConnell had \u201ceffectively turned the United States Senate into a very expensive lunch club that occasionally votes on a judge or two.\u201d\n\nThe same week, Politico ran a piece describing the upper chamber as a legislative \u201cgraveyard,\u201d adding, \u201cThe Senate standstill is frustrating even some in the GOP.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s against this backdrop that Mitch McConnell, reading from a prepared text with a straight face, wants to talk about House Democrats taking \u201ca one-year vacation from any productive legislation.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s hypocrisy and then there\u2019s you\u2019ve-got-to-be-kidding-me hypocrisy.", "description": "There's hypocrisy and then there's you've-got-to-be-kidding-me hypocrisy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/gettyimages-482926760__1438798122.jpg?itok=uCluqOvi", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
