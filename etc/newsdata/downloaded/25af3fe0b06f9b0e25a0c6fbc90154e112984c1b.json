The drone attack Saturday on Saudi Arabia's Abqaiq plant and its Khurais oil field led to the interruption of an estimated 5.7 million barrels of the kingdom's crude oil production per day, equivalent to more than 5% of the world's daily supply. (U.S. government/Digital Globe via AP)\n\nThe loss of 5% of world crude oil output from an attack on Saudi Arabia's largest oil processing plant pushed crude prices sharply higher on Monday.\n\nU.S. crude oil was trading 9% higher while Brent crude added more than 10%. The attack on the Saudi Aramco facility halted output of more than half of Saudi Arabia's daily exports.\n\nThat's especially worrying for oil thirsty Asia: China, Japan, South Korea and India are major customers for Saudi oil.\n\n\"The attacks this time posed a serious threat to key international energy infrastructure, and we express concern that they undermine the energy security of the entire world and stability in the region,\" South Korea's Foreign Ministry said in a statement.\n\n\"We condemn any similar acts,\" it said.\n\nOil prices spiked shortly after trading began Monday, with U.S. crude jumping more than 15% and Brent leaping nearly 20%. But the initial surge moderated on talk of tapping strategic reserves to weather any shortfalls from the loss of 5.7 million barrels of crude processing capacity a day.\n\nU.S. crude had added $4.84 per barrel, or 8.8%, to $59.70 per barrel by mid-afternoon in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent picked up $6.02 per barrel, or 10%, to $66.24 per barrel.\n\nYemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the attack on the Saudi Aramco plant that paralyzed production of more than half of Saudi Arabia's global daily exports and more than 5% of the world's daily crude oil production.\n\n\"To take Saudi oil production down 50%, that's shocking,\" said Jonathan Aronson, a research analyst at Cornerstone Macro.\n\nThe attack may add to anxiety about the stability of the world's oil reserves. \"Saudi Arabia has been a very reliable supplier of oil in the world,\" said Jim Burkhard, who heads crude oil research for IHS Markit. This attack is \"adding a geopolitical premium back into the price of oil.\" That means oil prices would rise because of worries about more unrest hurting supply. Higher oil prices tend to hurt the economy as consumer costs rise.\n\nAsia is the region most vulnerable to big supply disruptions.\n\nSaudi Arabia provides about a fifth of China's crude imports, more than 37% of Japan's and almost a third of South Korea's. Japan is nearly 100% dependent on imports for its oil.\n\nThe world's richest countries have oil reserves of more than 2 billion barrels, but releasing those to alleviate supply concerns could potentially backfire and result in higher prices on the market as traders worry that there is a problem with tight supply, said Burkhard.\n\nAccording to the Joint Organization Data Initiative, Saudi Arabia has nearly 27 days worth of reserves. It holds reserves at home and in Egypt, Japan and the Netherlands. That can alleviate some concerns.\n\nMeanwhile work was under way to restore production at the Abquaiq plant. The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday that Saudi officials said a third of crude output would be restored by Monday. Bringing the entire plant back online may take weeks. Officials said they would use other facilities and existing stocks to supplant the plant's production.\n\nChris Midgley, global head of analytics for S&P Global Platts, estimates prices could surge into the \"high $70\" per barrel range. It could go even higher if disruptions are prolonged, but that is not expected, he said in a research note.\n\nThe situation is better today than it would have been a decade ago, thanks to the U.S. energy boom.\n\nThe U.S. has a cushion because it and Canada both produce plenty of oil, leaving the U.S. less reliant on the Middle East. But it's still a global market. \"If you take oil anywhere out of system it affects everybody,\" said Burkhard.\n\nStill, even if the plant goes back online and there is no fundamental change to the world's supply of oil, prices may move higher and stay higher because traders would build in a \"security premium,\" said Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research.\n\nIt would reflect worries that future attacks might jeopardize global oil supplies. And in a world already concerned about supply, the impact of another attack could mean a sharp effect on prices, said Kevin Book, managing director of Clearview Energy Partners. \"It's almost like an open season for a big attack.\"\n\nStory continues", "description": "The loss of 5% of world crude oil output from an attack on Saudi Arabia's largest oil processing plant pushed crude prices sharply higher on Monday.
