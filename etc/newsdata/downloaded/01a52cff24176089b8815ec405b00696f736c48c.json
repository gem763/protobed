They\u2019re lobbying to revive the \u201cinherent contempt\u201d process, which would allow Congress to arrest and fine or imprison officials who refuse to show up for their scheduled testimony. But at least so far, most Democrats want to just plow ahead with the impeachment investigation, interpreting the White House\u2019s latest stiff-arm as an egregious example of obstruction of justice, bolstering their case for impeachment.\n\n\u201cThe White House should be warned that continued efforts to hide the truth of the president\u2019s abuse of power from the American people will be regarded as further evidence of obstruction,\u201d Pelosi said in a statement released Tuesday. \u201cMr. President, you are not above the law. You will be held accountable.\u201d\n\nOne way to get witnesses such as Sondland to testify is by holding them in inherent contempt. The procedure hasn\u2019t been used since 1934, but some lawmakers believe that the time has come to reinstate the process, which would mean laying out guidelines for how to use it. \u201cWe need to revisit inherent contempt,\u201d Representative Gerry Connolly of Virginia, a member of the House Oversight Committee, told me. \u201cI can tell you the sentiment on [the] Oversight and Reform [Committee] is growing that we should do it.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Harley Rouda of California, another member of the Oversight Committee, told me that \u201cthere\u2019s a lot more conversation around whether it should be used, and if so, how.\u201d The defiance on the part of executive-branch officials shouldn\u2019t go unanswered, Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland told me. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the House should establish an inherent-contempt machinery and process,\u201d he said.\n\nBut both Connolly and Raskin acknowledged that such a process would be time-consuming and impractical, given that there\u2019s currently no set procedure for Congress to follow in fining or jailing officials who refuse to comply with subpoenas. And while none of the Democratic lawmakers I spoke with ruled out resorting to inherent contempt, it\u2019s hardly the most appealing option for those already worried about the potential political ramifications of backing impeachment; after all, arresting noncompliant administration officials and throwing them in jail would arguably be a much more dramatic move than pursuing impeachment in the first place.\n\nRead: Trump\u2019s game of chicken\n\n\u201cI just think that\u2019s really unlikely. It\u2019s kind of comic opera,\u201d says Frank Bowman III, a law professor at the University of Missouri and the author of a recent book on impeachment. \u201cWhat happens if you\u2019re trying to arrest the vice president or the secretary of state? Those guys have got guys with guns. Do we have a showdown at the O. K. Corral over inherent contempt?\u201d", "description": "The White House\u2019s lack of cooperation with impeachment-inquiry proceedings leaves Democrats few viable options.", "authors": ["Elaine Godfrey"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/AP_19275597347752/facebook.jpg?1570741276", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
