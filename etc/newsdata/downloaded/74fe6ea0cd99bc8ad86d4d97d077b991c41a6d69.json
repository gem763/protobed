The official count from the Fire and Disaster Management Agency was 19 dead and 13 missing.\n\nHagibis dropped record amounts of rain for a period in some spots, according to meteorological officials, causing Japan\u2019s many rivers to overflow.\n\nSome of the muddy waters in streets, fields and residential areas have subsided. But many places remained flooded, with homes and surrounding roads covered in mud and littered with broken wooden pieces and debris. Some places normally dry still looked like giant rivers.\n\nPeople who lined up for morning soup at evacuation shelters expressed worries about the homes they had left behind. Survivors and rescuers will also face colder weather with northern Japan turning chilly this week.\n\nMore than 20 rivers had flooded. Some rivers had overflowed in several spots.\n\nDamage was serious in Nagano prefecture, where an embankment of the Chikuma River broke.\n\nRescue efforts were in full force with soldiers and firefighters deployed from throughout Japan. Helicopters plucked those stranded on the second floor and rooftops of submerged homes.\n\nAreas in Miyagi and Fukushima prefectures in northern Japan were also badly flooded.\n\nIn such areas, rescue crew paddled in little boats to each half-underwater home, calling out to anyone left stranded.\n\nTokyo Electric Power Co. said 56,800 homes were still without electricity Monday in Tokyo and nearby prefectures that the utility serves. Tohoku Electric Power Co. said 5,600 homes were without power in Miyagi, Iwate, Fukushima and Niigata.\n\nTama River in Tokyo also overflowed, but damage was not as great as other areas.\n\nMuch of life in Tokyo returned to normal. People were out and about in the city, trains were running, and store shelves left bare when people were stockpiling were replenished.\n\n___\n\nFollow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama\n\nOn Instagram https://www.instagram.com/yurikageyama/?hl=en", "description": "TOKYO (AP) \u2014 Rescue crew dug through mudslides and searched near swollen rivers Monday after a typhoon caused serious damage in central and northern", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/13/e000ee_japan-asia-typhoon-29950-debris-caused-by-typhoon-hagibis-are-left-on-street-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
