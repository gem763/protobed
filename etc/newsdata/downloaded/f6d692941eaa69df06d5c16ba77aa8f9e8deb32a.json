I don\u2019t know where the balance nets out for us long-term, but some form of hybrid technology is certainly on our radar\u2026after 2021,\u201d he said.\n\nA NASCAR rep speaking on background added further clarification saying, \u201cNothing is fully confirmed until it hits the race track. That said, hybrid tech could certainly be in our cars by 2022, if all plans stay on track.\u201d\n\nNASCAR will wait until after its Next-Gen gas race car guidelines release in 2021. \u201cTrying to do it all at once would be overwhelming,\u201d Probst said.\n\nAs for application, NASCAR would likely debut hybrids for racing on shorter courses and those with more turns and braking. That could include technical tracks \u2014 such as Watkins Glen or Charlotte Motor Speedway\u2019s Roval \u2014 but would not be limited to that.\n\n\u201cWe have to research all of this, but I think there are also some deployment options for intermediates and our speedways that can be explored,\u201d Probst said, referring to courses of 1.5 miles or less in length.\n\nMany of NASCAR\u2019s races \u2014 like the Daytona 500 \u2014 are endurance motorsport events (with multiple pit-stops) held on 1.5 to 2 mile oval tracks.\n\nIt could take more time to develop hybrid engine cars for these full-throttle formats, since EVs lose their regenerative braking qualities at steady rates of speed.\n\nNASCAR is still sorting how a race hybrid would come together. \u201cIt will likely be some form of electrification parallel with our current internal combustion engine to add power,\u201d Probst said.\n\nRather than use hybrid technology solely to extend range, NASCAR will look to harness it toward improved performance.\n\n\u201cBraking is typically used as a mechanism to get the power back into the batteries. As far as when you actually apply the power. I think that that\u2019s what we need to study\u2026and work through with our OEMs on how it\u2019s deployed,\u201d Probst said.\n\nNASCAR could find ways to deploy hybrid technology for a supercharged or turbo effect on race cars.\n\n\u201cIs it deployed automatically in some pre-canned strategy? Is it deployed in the form of a button that the driver hits to get extra power to make a pass or complete a pass? Those are all areas that we have to look at,\u201d Probst said.\n\n\u201cI think you could\u2026use the engine to actually do the regen. So the driver gives up an amount of power, knowing that he\u2019s recharging the battery to then strategically use the boost later on in the race.\u201d\n\nHowever NASCAR configures its hybrid setup, it could have application for EV tech on production cars sold by the race series\u2019 manufacturing partners Ford, Chevy, and Toyota.\n\n\u201cAs OEMs, NASCAR looking at a hybrid for the future is of interest to us,\u201d said Pat DiMarco, Ford Performance\u2019s NASCAR Manager.\n\nWhile what currently runs on the race track is dissimilar to any production vehicle, there\u2019s still a connection from NASCAR to the showroom floor, according to DiMarco.\n\n\u201cThe days of old\u2026when we built an engine to go racing and took the the parts off that to put directly into a production car, a lot of that isn\u2019t there,\u201d he said.\n\nBut DiMarco noted a number of things Ford teams use in NASCAR \u2014 such as systems to improve engine performance and aerodynamics \u2014 find their way to engineering teams in Michigan.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll use the tools here, develop them better in racing, make them more accurate, and everything automatically transfers to production,\u201d he said.\n\nNASCAR champion and current driver Brad Keselowski is long on hybrids in the sport. \u201cI\u2019m a big fan of the technology,\u201d he told TechCrunch between races at Charlotte Motor Speedway.\n\n\u201cOne, it gives the sport greater performance potential out of the cars and, two, it gives NASCAR relevance to the marketplace \u2014 because nobody will develop this technology harder or faster in motorsports than we will,\u201d Keselowski said.", "description": "NASCAR could introduce hybrid powered cars as early as 2022, NASCAR\u2019s SVP for Racing Development John Probst told TechCrunch.
