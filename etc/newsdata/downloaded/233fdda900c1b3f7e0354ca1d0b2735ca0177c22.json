While it shouldn't prevent the Fed from agreeing to cut rates by another quarter point on Oct. 30, it doesn't provide a firm pretext for significant or sustained U.S. dollar depreciation.\"\n\nThe deal represents the biggest step between the United States and China in a 15-month trade dispute. Friday's announcement did not include many details and Trump said it could take up to five weeks to get a pact written. He acknowledged the agreement could fall apart during that period, though he expressed confidence that it would not.

The British and Irish prime ministers said on Thursday they had found \"a pathway\" to a possible deal, and by Friday some officials were expressing guarded optimism.\n\nOn Sunday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told his cabinet a last-minute deal was still possible as the two sides pressed on with intensive talks to try to avoid a disorderly Brexit on Oct. 31. said there would be more talks on Monday, with Johnson hoping a deal will be agreed in time for EU leaders to approve it at a summit in Brussels on Thursday and Friday this week.\n\nBut he will still have to convince a deeply divided British parliament to ratify the agreement, while the European Commission said \"a lot of work remains to be done\" in a statement issued late on Sunday.", "description": "FOREX-Dollar holds near 2-1/2-mth yen high on U.S.-China partial deal, pound stands tall", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEE7E039_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
