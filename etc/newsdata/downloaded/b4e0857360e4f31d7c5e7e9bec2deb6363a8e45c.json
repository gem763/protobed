If you can develop the plan further, I think we can have a debate about it, but we can\u2019t wait.\u201d\n\nButtigieg went on to criticize what he sees as an exorbitant amount of tweaking and refining that slows gun control proposals. He said, \u201cWe can\u2019t wait for universal background checks\u2026we can wait to ban the sale of new weapons and \u201chigh capacity\u201d magazines, so we don\u2019t wind up with millions more of these things on the streets.\u201d He listed numerous other gun controls that he said the Democrats \u201ccan\u2019t wait for,\u201d then summarized, saying, \u201cWe cannot wait for purity tests, we have to just get something done.\u201d\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.
