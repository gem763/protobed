Given the size of the required adjustment, however, additional tax measures are under consideration,\u201d Treasury said in its Medium-term Budget Policy Statement, tabled by Minister of Finance Tito Mboweni in Parliament on Wednesday.\n\nMboweni painted a grim picture of SA\u2019s government finances, forecasting that government debt \u2013 fuelled by a massive civil servant wage bill (which now represents 46% of total tax revenue) and struggling state-owned enterprises, particularly Eskom \u2013 will reach more than 71% of GDP by 2022. The national debt currently tops R3trn.\n\nNew taxes and tax hikes over recent years \u2013 including an increase in VAT last year, the introduction of a tax on sugary drinks and a carbon fuel levy on petrol and diesel \u2013 have not earned the expected revenue. This year, for the first time since the early 1990s, government didn\u2019t adjust income tax for inflation, which took another bite out of South African salaries.\n\nBut the weak economy hit the tax income from corporates and households, with tax collection now expected to be R53bn below the budgeted amount for the year.", "description": "\"Given the size of the required adjustment, additional tax measures are under consideration,\" Treasury warned in its medium-term budget.", "authors": ["Minutes Ago"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9539/04b432c637d74285a3122fe4af4501f6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
