This is reportedly the second major coalition launched by India outside of the UN, after International Solar Alliance with 80 members.\n\nVery creditable.\n\nExcept that our own infrastructure of such basic physical amenities as roads, bridges, sidewalks, railway lines, government hospitals, schools and public utilities are an unmitigated disaster \u2013 leave alone being disaster-resilient. So our international alliance for disaster-proof infrastructure when we do not even have a national alliance across our own states to standardise basic infrastructure and systems is like our giving $ 1 billion to Russia for development of their Far East, when our own North (read J & K) and North-East are in a pathetic state of neglect.\n\nIt is difficult to see how India can contribute to \u201ctransformative initiatives\u201d helping cities worldwide for \u201cbuilding to last\u201d via CDRI, when our bridges routinely collapse on the day of inauguration, and roads develop craters with the first onset of monsoons, and city after city is at the brink of civic collapse or running out of water. It is also hilarious to note that India will set targets for member-countries to bring down disaster deaths and economic losses, when we are unable to have our own States cooperate to reign in traffic or speed-bump related deaths through an amended Motor Vehicles Act.\n\nOur institutions and initiatives need to become regional-class and national class before we aspire to counsel the world at large at developing superior infrastructure. I am even surprised that UNDRR (UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction) should be unaware how risky and disaster-prone India\u2019s physical infrastructure is, even as India sets about advising the world to make their infrastructure disaster-proof.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, India, through the aegis of CDRI is set to advise the world on standards and regulation for infrastructure sector when we have virtually no standards of our own for any of our own infrastructure. And when we have a modicum of standards, we have zero ability to enforce those standards, so that our national highways, state-highways, Panchayat and city roads may as well be all from different planets.\n\nYes, India is expected to spend $ 1.5 Trillion on infrastructure in the next ten years (we are always good at projecting numbers for the future). But how sustainable will be this investment? Or will it all be mostly for the politicians to play games, as we are witnessing in the new State of Andhra with a half-built city being sent to seed.\n\nTrue, challenges facing India with its 1.3 billion people and large-scale corruption are many and mammoth, with democracy being interpreted to mean a fundamental right to behave in whatever random manner we deem fit, without any sense of duty of citizenry.\n\nNo prizes for guessing whether our PM\u2019s charisma and rhetoric alone can fix it all. It cannot. India as a nation needs to walk what PM Modi talks, if it has to give substance to the mandate it has given him. On his part, the PM perhaps needs to set highest priority for our political, electoral, judicial and police reforms, if Indian infrastructure, both physical and social, is to narrow its gap with the more functioning countries. Being better than Pakistan, Afghanistan or sub-Saharan Africa would cut little ice. Sadly however, even though the current dispensation came to power in 2014 on the platform of combating corruption, there has been little systemic traction down the rank and file of the government machinery.\n\nCorruption is at the core of our poor infrastructure and lack of standardisation. Electoral and political reforms are required to attack the core of corruption. Judicial and police reforms are required to hold the corrupt duly accountable, and if police and judiciary are not to be reduced to tools of the rich and powerful or for settling political scores.\n\nBasic dignity of life, delivered through a functioning infrastructure, both physical and social, is an imperative that can no longer be postponed. If serious steps are not undertaken to address these issues when PM Modi\u2019s popularity reigns at an all-time high, we would have lost a historic opportunity to set the nation on the right trajectory.\n\nTruth is Indian governments over the decades have not learnt to deliver elementary civic amenities, disaster resilient or not, beyond vote-bank politics. We need to at least deliver these within our own country before we look to improve the world.", "description": "The UN has applauded PM Modi for the launch of Global Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI), with 35 odd members.
