She pleaded guilty in December on a charge of conspiracy to violate the law governing foreign agents.\n\nShe left the Federal Correctional Institution in Tallahassee, Fla., on Friday, and is expected to be deported to Russia.\n\nButina has so far been the only Russian national arrested in connection with the Justice Department investigation of the Kremlin\u2019s electoral interference three years ago.\n\n\u201cI should have registered [as a foreign agent], which I didn\u2019t,\u201d Butina said in May. \u201cThis is why this whole thing got started.\u201d\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin criticized the \u201carbitrary\u201d case against Butina.\n\n\u201cThey took, grabbed her, put the girl in jail, but there was nothing to show for it,\u201d Putin told state-run news agency Ria Novosti.\n\nButina cooperated with U.S. authorities as part of a plea deal, providing information on her boyfriend, Republican political operative Paul Erickson. He was indicted on wire fraud and money laundering charges in a separate case in South Dakota.\n\nRussia was accused of arresting U.S. citizen Paul Whelan in June as retaliation for Butina\u2019s arrest. He\u2019s been held in a Russian prison for 300 days without trial. A judge on Thursday ordered him held until at least December, and his trial is not expected until next spring.", "description": "Oct. 25 (UPI) \u2014 Russian political operative Maria Butina was released from a Florida prison Friday after completing an 18-month sentence for", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
