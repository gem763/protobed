The military\u2019s end goal is to incorporate cutting-edge technologies into its war-fighting plans.\n\n\u201cThe government is interested in a variety of the collaborator\u2019s technologies, such as, but not limited to inertial mass reduction, mechanical/structural metamaterials, electromagnetic metamaterial wave guides, quantum physics, quantum communications, and beamed energy propulsion,\u201d a portion of the contract reads.\n\nMr. DeLonge, who gained fame as a singer and guitarist in the rock bands Blink 182 and Angels & Airwaves, has carved out a second career as an extraterrestrial researcher. His academy \u2014 which also has former defense and government officials in its ranks \u2014 has become a leading advocate for UFO research and has worked to publicize military and government encounters with unidentified aircraft.\n\nThe organization\u2019s contract with the government suggests that it\u2019s taken on another role and is working on research of high interest to the Pentagon.\n\n\u201cOur partnership with TTSA serves as an exciting, non-traditional source for novel materials and transformational technologies to enhance our military ground system capabilities,\u201d Joseph Cannon, deputy product manager with Army Futures Command, said in a joint press release announcing the partnership.\n\nWhile the Army contract formalizes Mr. DeLonge\u2019s collaboration with the government, it\u2019s been clear for years that his work had caught the attention of high-ranking U.S. officials. Throughout 2015, Mr. DeLonge corresponded with John Podesta \u2014 who was then serving as Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign chairman \u2014 about extraterrestrial research. Mr. Podesta previously served as chief of staff to President Clinton and counselor to President Obama.\n\nMr. Podesta\u2019s exchanges with Mr. DeLonge, along with a trove of other emails, were released as part of the 2016 WikiLeaks hack.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
