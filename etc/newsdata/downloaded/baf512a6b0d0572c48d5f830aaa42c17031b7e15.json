He was a Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning journalist and the author of Big Little Man: In Search of My Asian Self. For more about Alex, please see this editor\u2019s note. The ashes filled a black plastic box about the size of a toaster. It weighed three and a half pounds. I put it in a canvas tote bag and packed it in my suitcase this past July for the transpacific flight to Manila. From there I would travel by car to a rural village. When I arrived, I would hand over all that was left of the woman who had spent 56 years as a slave in my family\u2019s household.

She was 4 foot 11, with mocha-brown skin and almond eyes that I can still see looking into mine\u2014my first memory. She was 18 years old when my grandfather gave her to my mother as a gift, and when my family moved to the United States, we brought her with us. No other word but slave encompassed the life she lived. Her days began before everyone else woke and ended after we went to bed. She prepared three meals a day, cleaned the house, waited on my parents, and took care of my four siblings and me. My parents never paid her, and they scolded her constantly. She wasn\u2019t kept in leg irons, but she might as well have been. So many nights, on my way to the bathroom, I\u2019d spot her sleeping in a corner, slumped against a mound of laundry, her fingers clutching a garment she was in the middle of folding.

They told us so. My father had a law degree, my mother was on her way to becoming a doctor, and my siblings and I got good grades and always said \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cthank you.\u201d We never talked about Lola. Our secret went to the core of who we were and, at least for us kids, who we wanted to be. After my mother died of leukemia, in 1999, Lola came to live with me in a small town north of Seattle. I had a family, a career, a house in the suburbs\u2014the American dream. And then I had a slave. At baggage claim in Manila, I unzipped my suitcase to make sure Lola\u2019s ashes were still there. Outside, I inhaled the familiar smell: a thick blend of exhaust and waste, of ocean and sweet fruit and sweat. Early the next morning I found a driver, an affable middle-aged man who went by the nickname \u201cDoods,\u201d and we hit the road in his truck, weaving through traffic. The scene always stunned me. The sheer number of cars and motorcycles and jeepneys. The people weaving between them and moving on the sidewalks in great brown rivers. The street vendors in bare feet trotting alongside cars, hawking cigarettes and cough drops and sacks of boiled peanuts. The child beggars pressing their faces against the windows. I had a family, a career, a house in the suburbs\u2014the American dream. And then I had a slave. Doods and I were headed to the place where Lola\u2019s story began, up north in the central plains: Tarlac province. Rice country. The home of a cigar-chomping army lieutenant named Tomas Asuncion, my grandfather. The family stories paint Lieutenant Tom as a formidable man given to eccentricity and dark moods, who had lots of land but little money and kept mistresses in separate houses on his property. His wife died giving birth to their only child, my mother. She was raised by a series of utusans, or \u201cpeople who take commands.\u201d\n\nSlavery has a long history on the islands. Before the Spanish came, islanders enslaved other islanders, usually war captives, criminals, or debtors. Slaves came in different varieties, from warriors who could earn their freedom through valor to household servants who were regarded as property and could be bought and sold or traded. High-status slaves could own low-status slaves, and the low could own the lowliest. Some chose to enter servitude simply to survive: In exchange for their labor, they might be given food, shelter, and protection. Related Stories Slavery's Global Comeback\n\nWhere the World's Slaves Live When the Spanish arrived, in the 1500s, they enslaved islanders and later brought African and Indian slaves. The Spanish Crown eventually began phasing out slavery at home and in its colonies, but parts of the Philippines were so far-flung that authorities couldn\u2019t keep a close eye. Traditions persisted under different guises, even after the U.S. took control of the islands in 1898. Today even the poor can have utusans or katulongs (\u201chelpers\u201d) or kasambahays (\u201cdomestics\u201d), as long as there are people even poorer. The pool is deep. Lieutenant Tom had as many as three families of utusans living on his property. In the spring of 1943, with the islands under Japanese occupation, he brought home a girl from a village down the road. She was a cousin from a marginal side of the family, rice farmers. The lieutenant was shrewd\u2014he saw that this girl was penniless, unschooled, and likely to be malleable. Her parents wanted her to marry a pig farmer twice her age, and she was desperately unhappy but had nowhere to go. Tom approached her with an offer: She could have food and shelter if she would commit to taking care of his daughter, who had just turned 12.\n\nLola agreed, not grasping that the deal was for life. \u201cShe is my gift to you,\u201d Lieutenant Tom told my mother. \u201cI don\u2019t want her,\u201d my mother said, knowing she had no choice. Lieutenant Tom went off to fight the Japanese, leaving Mom behind with Lola in his creaky house in the provinces. Lola fed, groomed, and dressed my mother. When they walked to the market, Lola held an umbrella to shield her from the sun. At night, when Lola\u2019s other tasks were done\u2014feeding the dogs, sweeping the floors, folding the laundry that she had washed by hand in the Camiling River\u2014she sat at the edge of my mother\u2019s bed and fanned her to sleep. One day during the war Lieutenant Tom came home and caught my mother in a lie\u2014something to do with a boy she wasn\u2019t supposed to talk to. Tom, furious, ordered her to \u201cstand at the table.\u201d Mom cowered with Lola in a corner. Then, in a quivering voice, she told her father that Lola would take her punishment. Lola looked at Mom pleadingly, then without a word walked to the dining table and held on to the edge. Tom raised the belt and delivered 12 lashes, punctuating each one with a word. You. Do. Not. Lie. To. Me. You. Do. Not. Lie. To. Me. Lola made no sound.\n\nMy mother, in recounting this story late in her life, delighted in the outrageousness of it, her tone seeming to say, Can you believe I did that? When I brought it up with Lola, she asked to hear Mom\u2019s version. She listened intently, eyes lowered, and afterward she looked at me with sadness and said simply, \u201cYes. It was like that.\u201d Seven years later, in 1950, Mom married my father and moved to Manila, bringing Lola along. Lieutenant Tom had long been haunted by demons, and in 1951 he silenced them with a .32\u2011caliber slug to his temple. Mom almost never talked about it. She had his temperament\u2014moody, imperial, secretly fragile\u2014and she took his lessons to heart, among them the proper way to be a provincial matrona: You must embrace your role as the giver of commands. You must keep those beneath you in their place at all times, for their own good and the good of the household. They might cry and complain, but their souls will thank you. They will love you for helping them be what God intended. My brother Arthur was born in 1951. I came next, followed by three more siblings in rapid succession. My parents expected Lola to be as devoted to us kids as she was to them. While she looked after us, my parents went to school and earned advanced degrees, joining the ranks of so many others with fancy diplomas but no jobs. Then the big break: Dad was offered a job in Foreign Affairs as a commercial analyst. The salary would be meager, but the position was in America\u2014a place he and Mom had grown up dreaming of, where everything they hoped for could come true. Dad was allowed to bring his family and one domestic. Figuring they would both have to work, my parents needed Lola to care for the kids and the house. My mother informed Lola, and to her great irritation, Lola didn\u2019t immediately acquiesce. Years later Lola told me she was terrified. \u201cIt was too far,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe your Mom and Dad won\u2019t let me go home.\u201d\n\nIn the end what convinced Lola was my father\u2019s promise that things would be different in America. He told her that as soon as he and Mom got on their feet, they\u2019d give her an \u201callowance.\u201d Lola could send money to her parents, to all her relations in the village. Her parents lived in a hut with a dirt floor. Lola could build them a concrete house, could change their lives forever. Imagine. We landed in Los Angeles on May 12, 1964, all our belongings in cardboard boxes tied with rope. Lola had been with my mother for 21 years by then. In many ways she was more of a parent to me than either my mother or my father. Hers was the first face I saw in the morning and the last one I saw at night. As a baby, I uttered Lola\u2019s name (which I first pronounced \u201cOh-ah\u201d) long before I learned to say \u201cMom\u201d or \u201cDad.\u201d As a toddler, I refused to go to sleep unless Lola was holding me, or at least nearby. I was 4 years old when we arrived in the U.S.\u2014too young to question Lola\u2019s place in our family. But as my siblings and I grew up on this other shore, we came to see the world differently. The leap across the ocean brought about a leap in consciousness that Mom and Dad couldn\u2019t, or wouldn\u2019t, make. Lola never got that allowance. She asked my parents about it in a roundabout way a couple of years into our life in America. Her mother had fallen ill (with what I would later learn was dysentery), and her family couldn\u2019t afford the medicine she needed. \u201cPwede ba?\u201d she said to my parents. Is it possible? Mom let out a sigh. \u201cHow could you even ask?,\u201d Dad responded in Tagalog. \u201cYou see how hard up we are. Don\u2019t you have any shame?\u201d\n\nMy parents had borrowed money for the move to the U.S., and then borrowed more in order to stay. My father was transferred from the consulate general in L.A. to the Philippine consulate in Seattle. He was paid $5,600 a year. He took a second job cleaning trailers, and a third as a debt collector. Mom got work as a technician in a couple of medical labs. We barely saw them, and when we did they were often exhausted and snappish. Mom would come home and upbraid Lola for not cleaning the house well enough or for forgetting to bring in the mail. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you I want the letters here when I come home?\u201d she would say in Tagalog, her voice venomous. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard naman! An idiot could remember.\u201d Then my father would arrive and take his turn. When Dad raised his voice, everyone in the house shrank. Sometimes my parents would team up until Lola broke down crying, almost as though that was their goal. It confused me: My parents were good to my siblings and me, and we loved them. But they\u2019d be affectionate to us kids one moment and vile to Lola the next. I was 11 or 12 when I began to see Lola\u2019s situation clearly. By then Arthur, eight years my senior, had been seething for a long time. He was the one who introduced the word slave into my understanding of what Lola was. Before he said it I\u2019d thought of her as just an unfortunate member of the household. I hated when my parents yelled at her, but it hadn\u2019t occurred to me that they\u2014and the whole arrangement\u2014could be immoral. \u201cDo you know anybody treated the way she\u2019s treated?,\u201d Arthur said. \u201cWho lives the way she lives?\u201d He summed up Lola\u2019s reality: Wasn\u2019t paid. Toiled every day. Was tongue-lashed for sitting too long or falling asleep too early. Was struck for talking back. Wore hand-me-downs. Ate scraps and leftovers by herself in the kitchen. Rarely left the house. Had no friends or hobbies outside the family. Had no private quarters. (Her designated place to sleep in each house we lived in was always whatever was left\u2014a couch or storage area or corner in my sisters\u2019 bedroom. She often slept among piles of laundry.)\n\nWe couldn\u2019t identify a parallel anywhere except in slave characters on TV and in the movies. I remember watching a Western called The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. John Wayne plays Tom Doniphon, a gunslinging rancher who barks orders at his servant, Pompey, whom he calls his \u201cboy.\u201d Pick him up, Pompey. Pompey, go find the doctor. Get on back to work, Pompey! Docile and obedient, Pompey calls his master \u201cMistah Tom.\u201d They have a complex relationship. Tom forbids Pompey from attending school but opens the way for Pompey to drink in a whites-only saloon. Near the end, Pompey saves his master from a fire. It\u2019s clear Pompey both fears and loves Tom, and he mourns when Tom dies. All of this is peripheral to the main story of Tom\u2019s showdown with bad guy Liberty Valance, but I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off Pompey. I remember thinking: Lola is Pompey, Pompey is Lola. We spent our first decade in the country trying to fit in. Having a slave did not fit. Having a slave gave me grave doubts about what kind of people we were, what kind of place we came from. One night when Dad found out that my sister Ling, who was then 9, had missed dinner, he barked at Lola for being lazy. \u201cI tried to feed her,\u201d Lola said, as Dad stood over her and glared. Her feeble defense only made him angrier, and he punched her just below the shoulder. Lola ran out of the room and I could hear her wailing, an animal cry. \u201cLing said she wasn\u2019t hungry,\u201d I said.\n\nMy parents turned to look at me. They seemed startled. I felt the twitching in my face that usually preceded tears, but I wouldn\u2019t cry this time. In Mom\u2019s eyes was a shadow of something I hadn\u2019t seen before. Jealousy? \u201cAre you defending your Lola?,\u201d Dad said. \u201cIs that what you\u2019re doing?\u201d \u201cLing said she wasn\u2019t hungry,\u201d I said again, almost in a whisper. I was 13. It was my first attempt to stick up for the woman who spent her days watching over me. The woman who used to hum Tagalog melodies as she rocked me to sleep, and when I got older would dress and feed me and walk me to school in the mornings and pick me up in the afternoons. Once, when I was sick for a long time and too weak to eat, she chewed my food for me and put the small pieces in my mouth to swallow. One summer when I had plaster casts on both legs (I had problem joints), she bathed me with a washcloth, brought medicine in the middle of the night, and helped me through months of rehabilitation. I was cranky through it all. She didn\u2019t complain or lose patience, ever. To now hear her wailing made me crazy. In the old country, my parents felt no need to hide their treatment of Lola. In America, they treated her worse but took pains to conceal it. When guests came over, my parents would either ignore her or, if questioned, lie and quickly change the subject. For five years in North Seattle, we lived across the street from the Misslers, a rambunctious family of eight who introduced us to things like mustard, salmon fishing, and mowing the lawn. Football on TV. Yelling during football. Lola would come out to serve food and drinks during games, and my parents would smile and thank her before she quickly disappeared. \u201cWho\u2019s that little lady you keep in the kitchen?,\u201d Big Jim, the Missler patriarch, once asked. A relative from back home, Dad said. Very shy.\n\nBilly Missler, my best friend, didn\u2019t buy it. He spent enough time at our house, whole weekends sometimes, to catch glimpses of my family\u2019s secret. He once overheard my mother yelling in the kitchen, and when he barged in to investigate found Mom red-faced and glaring at Lola, who was quaking in a corner. I came in a few seconds later. The look on Billy\u2019s face was a mix of embarrassment and perplexity. What was that? I waved it off and told him to forget it. I think Billy felt sorry for Lola. He\u2019d rave about her cooking, and make her laugh like I\u2019d never seen. During sleepovers, she\u2019d make his favorite Filipino dish, beef tapa over white rice. Cooking was Lola\u2019s only eloquence. I could tell by what she served whether she was merely feeding us or saying she loved us. When I once referred to Lola as a distant aunt, Billy reminded me that when we\u2019d first met I\u2019d said she was my grandmother. \u201cWell, she\u2019s kind of both,\u201d I said mysteriously. \u201cWhy is she always working?\u201d \u201cShe likes to work,\u201d I said. \u201cYour dad and mom\u2014why do they yell at her?\u201d \u201cHer hearing isn\u2019t so good \u2026\u201d Admitting the truth would have meant exposing us all. We spent our first decade in the country learning the ways of the new land and trying to fit in. Having a slave did not fit. Having a slave gave me grave doubts about what kind of people we were, what kind of place we came from. Whether we deserved to be accepted. I was ashamed of it all, including my complicity. Didn\u2019t I eat the food she cooked, and wear the clothes she washed and ironed and hung in the closet? But losing her would have been devastating.\n\nThere was another reason for secrecy: Lola\u2019s travel papers had expired in 1969, five years after we arrived in the U.S. She\u2019d come on a special passport linked to my father\u2019s job. After a series of fallings-out with his superiors, Dad quit the consulate and declared his intent to stay in the United States. He arranged for permanent-resident status for his family, but Lola wasn\u2019t eligible. He was supposed to send her back. Lola\u2019s mother, Fermina, died in 1973; her father, Hilario, in 1979. Both times she wanted desperately to go home. Both times my parents said \u201cSorry.\u201d No money, no time. The kids needed her. My parents also feared for themselves, they admitted to me later. If the authorities had found out about Lola, as they surely would have if she\u2019d tried to leave, my parents could have gotten into trouble, possibly even been deported. They couldn\u2019t risk it. Lola\u2019s legal status became what Filipinos call tago nang tago, or TNT\u2014\u201con the run.\u201d She stayed TNT for almost 20 years. After each of her parents died, Lola was sullen and silent for months. She barely responded when my parents badgered her. But the badgering never let up. Lola kept her head down and did her work.\n\nMy father\u2019s resignation started a turbulent period. Money got tighter, and my parents turned on each other. They uprooted the family again and again\u2014Seattle to Honolulu back to Seattle to the southeast Bronx and finally to the truck-stop town of Umatilla, Oregon, population 750. During all this moving around, Mom often worked 24-hour shifts, first as a medical intern and then as a resident, and Dad would disappear for days, working odd jobs but also (we\u2019d later learn) womanizing and who knows what else. Once, he came home and told us that he\u2019d lost our new station wagon playing blackjack. For days in a row Lola would be the only adult in the house. She got to know the details of our lives in a way that my parents never had the mental space for. We brought friends home, and she\u2019d listen to us talk about school and girls and boys and whatever else was on our minds. Just from conversations she overheard, she could list the first name of every girl I had a crush on from sixth grade through high school. When I was 15, Dad left the family for good. I didn\u2019t want to believe it at the time, but the fact was that he deserted us kids and abandoned Mom after 25 years of marriage. She wouldn\u2019t become a licensed physician for another year, and her specialty\u2014internal medicine\u2014wasn\u2019t especially lucrative. Dad didn\u2019t pay child support, so money was always a struggle. I heard Mom weeping and ran into the living room to find her slumped in Lola\u2019s arms. Lola was talking softly to her; the way she used to with my siblings and me when we were young. My mom kept herself together enough to go to work, but at night she\u2019d crumble in self-pity and despair. Her main source of comfort during this time: Lola. As Mom snapped at her over small things, Lola attended to her even more\u2014cooking Mom\u2019s favorite meals, cleaning her bedroom with extra care. I\u2019d find the two of them late at night at the kitchen counter, griping and telling stories about Dad, sometimes laughing wickedly, other times working themselves into a fury over his transgressions. They barely noticed us kids flitting in and out.\n\nOne night I heard Mom weeping and ran into the living room to find her slumped in Lola\u2019s arms. Lola was talking softly to her, the way she used to with my siblings and me when we were young. I lingered, then went back to my room, scared for my mom and awed by Lola. Doods was humming. I\u2019d dozed for what felt like a minute and awoke to his happy melody. \u201cTwo hours more,\u201d he said. I checked the plastic box in the tote bag by my side\u2014still there\u2014and looked up to see open road. The MacArthur Highway. I glanced at the time. \u201cHey, you said \u2018two hours\u2019 two hours ago,\u201d I said. Doods just hummed. His not knowing anything about the purpose of my journey was a relief. I had enough interior dialogue going on. I was no better than my parents. I could have done more to free Lola. To make her life better. Why didn\u2019t I? I could have turned in my parents, I suppose. It would have blown up my family in an instant. Instead, my siblings and I kept everything to ourselves, and rather than blowing up in an instant, my family broke apart slowly. Doods and I passed through beautiful country. Not travel-brochure beautiful but real and alive and, compared with the city, elegantly spare. Mountains ran parallel to the highway on each side, the Zambales Mountains to the west, the Sierra Madre Range to the east. From ridge to ridge, west to east, I could see every shade of green all the way to almost black. Doods pointed to a shadowy outline in the distance. Mount Pinatubo. I\u2019d come here in 1991 to report on the aftermath of its eruption, the second-largest of the 20th century. Volcanic mudflows called lahars continued for more than a decade, burying ancient villages, filling in rivers and valleys, and wiping out entire ecosystems. The lahars reached deep into the foothills of Tarlac province, where Lola\u2019s parents had spent their entire lives, and where she and my mother had once lived together. So much of our family record had been lost in wars and floods, and now parts were buried under 20 feet of mud. Life here is routinely visited by cataclysm. Killer typhoons that strike several times a year. Bandit insurgencies that never end. Somnolent mountains that one day decide to wake up. The Philippines isn\u2019t like China or Brazil, whose mass might absorb the trauma. This is a nation of scattered rocks in the sea. When disaster hits, the place goes under for a while. Then it resurfaces and life proceeds, and you can behold a scene like the one Doods and I were driving through, and the simple fact that it\u2019s still there makes it beautiful. A couple of years after my parents split, my mother remarried and demanded Lola\u2019s fealty to her new husband, a Croatian immigrant named Ivan, whom she had met through a friend. Ivan had never finished high school. He\u2019d been married four times and was an inveterate gambler who enjoyed being supported by my mother and attended to by Lola.\n\nIvan brought out a side of Lola I\u2019d never seen. His marriage to my mother was volatile from the start, and money\u2014especially his use of her money\u2014was the main issue. Once, during an argument in which Mom was crying and Ivan was yelling, Lola walked over and stood between them. She turned to Ivan and firmly said his name. He looked at Lola, blinked, and sat down. My sister Inday and I were floored. Ivan was about 250 pounds, and his baritone could shake the walls. Lola put him in his place with a single word. I saw this happen a few other times, but for the most part Lola served Ivan unquestioningly, just as Mom wanted her to. I had a hard time watching Lola vassalize herself to another person, especially someone like Ivan. But what set the stage for my blowup with Mom was something more mundane. She used to get angry whenever Lola felt ill. She didn\u2019t want to deal with the disruption and the expense, and would accuse Lola of faking or failing to take care of herself. Mom chose the second tack when, in the late 1970s, Lola\u2019s teeth started falling out. She\u2019d been saying for months that her mouth hurt. \u201cThat\u2019s what happens when you don\u2019t brush properly,\u201d Mom told her. I said that Lola needed to see a dentist. She was in her 50s and had never been to one. I was attending college an hour away, and I brought it up again and again on my frequent trips home. A year went by, then two. Lola took aspirin every day for the pain, and her teeth looked like a crumbling Stonehenge. One night, after watching her chew bread on the side of her mouth that still had a few good molars, I lost it.\n\nMom and I argued into the night, each of us sobbing at different points. She said she was tired of working her fingers to the bone supporting everybody, and sick of her children always taking Lola\u2019s side, and why didn\u2019t we just take our goddamn Lola, she\u2019d never wanted her in the first place, and she wished to God she hadn\u2019t given birth to an arrogant, sanctimonious phony like me. I let her words sink in. Then I came back at her, saying she would know all about being a phony, her whole life was a masquerade, and if she stopped feeling sorry for herself for one minute she\u2019d see that Lola could barely eat because her goddamn teeth were rotting out of her goddamn head, and couldn\u2019t she think of her just this once as a real person instead of a slave kept alive to serve her? \u201cA slave,\u201d Mom said, weighing the word. \u201cA slave?\u201d The night ended when she declared that I would never understand her relationship with Lola. Never. Her voice was so guttural and pained that thinking of it even now, so many years later, feels like a punch to the stomach. It\u2019s a terrible thing to hate your own mother, and that night I did. The look in her eyes made clear that she felt the same way about me. The fight only fed Mom\u2019s fear that Lola had stolen the kids from her, and she made Lola pay for it. Mom drove her harder. Tormented her by saying, \u201cI hope you\u2019re happy now that your kids hate me.\u201d When we helped Lola with housework, Mom would fume. \u201cYou\u2019d better go to sleep now, Lola,\u201d she\u2019d say sarcastically. \u201cYou\u2019ve been working too hard. Your kids are worried about you.\u201d Later she\u2019d take Lola into a bedroom for a talk, and Lola would walk out with puffy eyes.\n\nLola finally begged us to stop trying to help her. Why do you stay? we asked. \u201cWho will cook?\u201d she said, which I took to mean, Who would do everything? Who would take care of us? Of Mom? Another time she said, \u201cWhere will I go?\u201d This struck me as closer to a real answer. Coming to America had been a mad dash, and before we caught a breath a decade had gone by. We turned around, and a second decade was closing out. Lola\u2019s hair had turned gray. She\u2019d heard that relatives back home who hadn\u2019t received the promised support were wondering what had happened to her. She was ashamed to return. She had no contacts in America, and no facility for getting around. Phones puzzled her. Mechanical things\u2014ATMs, intercoms, vending machines, anything with a keyboard\u2014made her panic. Fast-talking people left her speechless, and her own broken English did the same to them. She couldn\u2019t make an appointment, arrange a trip, fill out a form, or order a meal without help. I got Lola an ATM card linked to my bank account and taught her how to use it. She succeeded once, but the second time she got flustered, and she never tried again. She kept the card because she considered it a gift from me. I also tried to teach her to drive. She dismissed the idea with a wave of her hand, but I picked her up and carried her to the car and planted her in the driver\u2019s seat, both of us laughing. I spent 20 minutes going over the controls and gauges. Her eyes went from mirthful to terrified. When I turned on the ignition and the dashboard lit up, she was out of the car and in the house before I could say another word. I tried a couple more times.\n\nI thought driving could change her life. She could go places. And if things ever got unbearable with Mom, she could drive away forever. Four lanes became two, pavement turned to gravel. Tricycle drivers wove between cars and water buffalo pulling loads of bamboo. An occasional dog or goat sprinted across the road in front of our truck, almost grazing the bumper. Doods never eased up. Whatever didn\u2019t make it across would be stew today instead of tomorrow\u2014the rule of the road in the provinces. I took out a map and traced the route to the village of Mayantoc, our destination. Out the window, in the distance, tiny figures folded at the waist like so many bent nails. People harvesting rice, the same way they had for thousands of years. We were getting close. I tapped the cheap plastic box and regretted not buying a real urn, made of porcelain or rosewood. What would Lola\u2019s people think? Not that many were left. Only one sibling remained in the area, Gregoria, 98 years old, and I was told her memory was failing. Relatives said that whenever she heard Lola\u2019s name, she\u2019d burst out crying and then quickly forget why. I\u2019d been in touch with one of Lola\u2019s nieces. She had the day planned: When I arrived, a low-key memorial, then a prayer, followed by the lowering of the ashes into a plot at the Mayantoc Eternal Bliss Memorial Park. It had been five years since Lola died, but I hadn\u2019t yet said the final goodbye that I knew was about to happen. All day I had been feeling intense grief and resisting the urge to let it out, not wanting to wail in front of Doods. More than the shame I felt for the way my family had treated Lola, more than my anxiety about how her relatives in Mayantoc would treat me, I felt the terrible heaviness of losing her, as if she had died only the day before.\n\nDoods veered northwest on the Romulo Highway, then took a sharp left at Camiling, the town Mom and Lieutenant Tom came from. Two lanes became one, then gravel turned to dirt. The path ran along the Camiling River, clusters of bamboo houses off to the side, green hills ahead. The homestretch. I gave the eulogy at Mom\u2019s funeral, and everything I said was true. That she was brave and spirited. That she\u2019d drawn some short straws, but had done the best she could. That she was radiant when she was happy. That she adored her children, and gave us a real home\u2014in Salem, Oregon\u2014that through the \u201980s and \u201990s became the permanent base we\u2019d never had before. That I wished we could thank her one more time. That we all loved her. I didn\u2019t talk about Lola. Just as I had selectively blocked Lola out of my mind when I was with Mom during her last years. Loving my mother required that kind of mental surgery. It was the only way we could be mother and son\u2014which I wanted, especially after her health started to decline, in the mid\u2011\u201990s. Diabetes. Breast cancer. Acute myelogenous leukemia, a fast-growing cancer of the blood and bone marrow. She went from robust to frail seemingly overnight. After the big fight, I mostly avoided going home, and at age 23 I moved to Seattle. When I did visit I saw a change. Mom was still Mom, but not as relentlessly. She got Lola a fine set of dentures and let her have her own bedroom. She cooperated when my siblings and I set out to change Lola\u2019s TNT status. Ronald Reagan\u2019s landmark immigration bill of 1986 made millions of illegal immigrants eligible for amnesty. It was a long process, but Lola became a citizen in October 1998, four months after my mother was diagnosed with leukemia. Mom lived another year.\n\nDuring that time, she and Ivan took trips to Lincoln City, on the Oregon coast, and sometimes brought Lola along. Lola loved the ocean. On the other side were the islands she dreamed of returning to. And Lola was never happier than when Mom relaxed around her. An afternoon at the coast or just 15 minutes in the kitchen reminiscing about the old days in the province, and Lola would seem to forget years of torment. The priest asked Mom whether there was anything she wanted to be forgiven for. She reached over and placed an open hand on Lola\u2019s head. She didn\u2019t say a word. I couldn\u2019t forget so easily. But I did come to see Mom in a different light. Before she died, she gave me her journals, two steamer trunks\u2019 full. Leafing through them as she slept a few feet away, I glimpsed slices of her life that I\u2019d refused to see for years. She\u2019d gone to medical school when not many women did. She\u2019d come to America and fought for respect as both a woman and an immigrant physician. She\u2019d worked for two decades at Fairview Training Center, in Salem, a state institution for the developmentally disabled. The irony: She tended to underdogs most of her professional life. They worshipped her. Female colleagues became close friends. They did silly, girly things together\u2014shoe shopping, throwing dress-up parties at one another\u2019s homes, exchanging gag gifts like penis-shaped soaps and calendars of half-naked men, all while laughing hysterically. Looking through their party pictures reminded me that Mom had a life and an identity apart from the family and Lola. Of course. Mom wrote in great detail about each of her kids, and how she felt about us on a given day\u2014proud or loving or resentful. And she devoted volumes to her husbands, trying to grasp them as complex characters in her story. We were all persons of consequence. Lola was incidental. When she was mentioned at all, she was a bit character in someone else\u2019s story. \u201cLola walked my beloved Alex to his new school this morning. I hope he makes new friends quickly so he doesn\u2019t feel so sad about moving again \u2026\u201d There might be two more pages about me, and no other mention of Lola.\n\nThe day before Mom died, a Catholic priest came to the house to perform last rites. Lola sat next to my mother\u2019s bed, holding a cup with a straw, poised to raise it to Mom\u2019s mouth. She had become extra attentive to my mother, and extra kind. She could have taken advantage of Mom in her feebleness, even exacted revenge, but she did the opposite. The priest asked Mom whether there was anything she wanted to forgive or be forgiven for. She scanned the room with heavy-lidded eyes, said nothing. Then, without looking at Lola, she reached over and placed an open hand on her head. She didn\u2019t say a word. Lola was 75 when she came to stay with me. I was married with two young daughters, living in a cozy house on a wooded lot. From the second story, we could see Puget Sound. We gave Lola a bedroom and license to do whatever she wanted: sleep in, watch soaps, do nothing all day. She could relax\u2014and be free\u2014for the first time in her life. I should have known it wouldn\u2019t be that simple. I\u2019d forgotten about all the things Lola did that drove me a little crazy. She was always telling me to put on a sweater so I wouldn\u2019t catch a cold (I was in my 40s). She groused incessantly about Dad and Ivan: My father was lazy, Ivan was a leech. I learned to tune her out. Harder to ignore was her fanatical thriftiness. She threw nothing out. And she used to go through the trash to make sure that the rest of us hadn\u2019t thrown out anything useful. She washed and reused paper towels again and again until they disintegrated in her hands. (No one else would go near them.) The kitchen became glutted with grocery bags, yogurt containers, and pickle jars, and parts of our house turned into storage for\u2014there\u2019s no other word for it\u2014garbage.", "description": "She lived with us for 56 years.
