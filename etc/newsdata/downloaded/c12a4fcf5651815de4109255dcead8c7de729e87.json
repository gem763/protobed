We are in a climate and nature emergency and if the government is serious about averting catastrophe these bills must be ambitious and trailblazing.\u201d\n\nAs the Queen\u2019s Speech was taking place, Extinction Rebellion activists were blockading the road outside the Bank of England in London over fossil fuel funding.\n\nBy this summer, climate change had risen to among the three most important issues facing this country, behind only Brexit and healthcare, according to polling by YouGov, and parties are vying to set out their green agendas.\n\nAmelia Womack, Green Party deputy leader, said: \u201cThis Queen\u2019s Speech does nothing to tackle the climate chaos we are living in.\n\n\u201cAs currently proposed, the Environment Bill will be an unambiguous weakening of the current protections. This bill should include policies such as clean air as a human right, new housing being carbon neutral and planting 30,000 hectares of new forest a year.\u201d\n\nThe bill also sets out a system for legally binding targets on environmental protection \u2013 much of which is currently governed by EU directives \u2013 and promises a new independent regulator to enforce the laws.\n\nProfessor Dave Goulson, from the University of Sussex, said: \u201cTackling the ongoing declines in wildlife is unlikely to succeed unless the government sets clear targets for reduction in pesticide use, with 16,900 tons of toxins currently applied to farmland each year, and every arable field receiving at average of 17 pesticide applications.\n\n\u201cThis would require support and advice for farmers to help them adopt alternative, sustainable schemes for pest management.\u201d\n\nThe speech also reintroduces the fisheries and agriculture bills, which will govern those sectors post-Brexit, and an Animal Welfare Bill to increase sentences for cruelty and recognise that animals are sentient.\n\nThe Agriculture Bill sets out plans to shift the current EU farming subsidy regime to a scheme where land managers will be paid to deliver \u201cpublic goods\u201d including better water quality, increased wildlife, access to the countryside, and flood protection.\n\nFriends of the Earth warned that the absence of a strong trade bill was a threat to people and the planet.\n\nDave Timms, head of political affairs at the campaign group, said: \u201cMPs have declared a climate emergency, and our planet is facing an ecological crisis, so the government should put our environment at the heart of policymaking \u2013 including new post-Brexit trade deals.\n\n\u201cNew trade deals must also be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. With climate-denier-in-chief, Donald Trump, and US corporations waiting eagerly with a list of toxic trade demands \u2013 the public should be very concerned that deals could be done without us, or even parliament, knowing what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by PA", "description": "The government has announced measures to improve air quality,\u00a0household recycling services and protect nature, but campaigners have warned although policies look encouraging the \u201cdevil will be in the detail\u201d.
