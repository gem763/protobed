Ben Sasse likes to say that \u201cAmerica is an idea\u201d \u2014 a commitment to universal dignity over brute power.\n\nYou have also told us that you went into politics to serve a higher purpose. Well, your moment has arrived.\n\nThe president of the United States is betraying his oath of office in the most fundamental way, by using the presidency for personal gain at the country\u2019s expense. He has corrupted our foreign policy with grubby attempts to help himself that his own White House staff immediately recognized as improper. He is telling the world that America does not, in fact, stand for any higher ideal. Can you for a moment imagine the icons of your party, like Ronald Reagan or Dwight Eisenhower, risking the security of a country threatened by Russia, for the sake of smearing a political rival?\n\nPresident Trump must go, and you \u2014 only you \u2014 have the power to make it happen.\n\nYou can start to distance yourself from him slowly, if it will help bring along your political base. A couple of you \u2014 like Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, who called Trump\u2019s behavior \u201cinappropriate,\u201d and Mitt Romney of Utah, who used the word \u201ctroubling\u201d \u2014 have begun to do so. But more of you should be moving in this direction, for the sake of the country and, ultimately, yourselves.", "description": "America is better than Donald Trump.", "authors": ["David Leonhardt"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/29/opinion/29leonhardtWeb/29leonhardtWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
