Its shares are down 30% over the past year.\n\n\u201cThe mobile market is as challenging as expected, underlining the need for the decisive actions that we set out in June,\u201d said Chief Executive Alex Baldock.\n\nDixons Carphone said first quarter like-for-like sales in its UK & Ireland electricals division rose 2%, while sales in its international division on the same basis were up 4%. Overall group like-for-like sales were flat - in line with analysts\u2019 consensus expectations.\n\n\u201cThe current political and economic climate is volatile but, assuming no material disruption from that, we stand by our full year guidance,\u201d added Baldock.", "description": "Britain's Dixons Carphone on Thursday reported another big fall in mobile phone sales in its latest quarter, though it maintained its financial guidance for the full 2019-20 year.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
