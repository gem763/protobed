REUTERS/Hannah McKay\n\nThe unemployment rate fell to 3.8%, back to its joint lowest since the three months to January 1975.\n\nJOB CREATION DOWN\n\nBut job creation was lower than anticipated at 31,000, weaker than the median forecast of 53,000 in the Reuters poll.\n\nVacancies fell too, touching their lowest level since the three months to November 2017 at 812,000, with small companies especially cautious about seeking new staff.\n\nBritain\u2019s economy, which has been flirting with recession ahead of Brexit, has been heavily reliant on spending by consumers that has been boosted by the country\u2019s jobs boom and rising pay.\n\nMany economists have attributed the strength of the labor market, at least in part, to employers hiring workers that they can later lay off rather than making longer-term commitments to investment.\n\nThere have been other signs that employers are turning more cautious about hiring before the Brexit deadline of Oct. 31, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson saying he will take Britain out of the EU without a transition deal if necessary.\n\nA survey published last week showed the number of workers hired for permanent jobs via recruitment agencies fell at the fastest pace in more than three years in August.

REUTERS/Eddie Keogh/File Photo\n\nDespite the rise in pay, the BOE is widely expected to wait for the outcome of Brexit - which it fears could damage Britain\u2019s economy if there is no deal with Brussels to ease the transition - before any decision to resume its gradual and limited series of interest rates hikes.\n\nRuth Gregory, an economist with consultancy Capital Economics, said the big picture of low unemployment and rising pay was likely to mean the BoE would stick to that plan when it announces its latest policy decision on Sept. 19.\n\n\u201cThe labor market still looks set to provide solid support to the economy over the next few years and could prevent the Bank of England from becoming too dovish against the weakening global backdrop when it meets again next week,\u201d she said.", "description": "Britain's workers received their biggest pay rises in more than 11 years this summer as the unemployment rate fell back to its lowest since the mid-1970s, even as the country's political crisis over Brexit deepened.", "authors": ["William Schomberg", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428282519&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF890TQ", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
