This morning Boris Johnson, or whoever looks after his Twitter feed, said he was \u201cglad\u201d about the confrontation with a father at an East London hospital. Hearing people\u2019s views was \u201cpart of my job,\u201d he declared.\n\nI suppose this was an attempt to seem magnanimous, even prime ministerial, which is something Johnson struggles with, while his ugly mob of supporters were descending on said father, Omar Salem.\n\nHe\u2019s a Labour activist, as if that has any relevance at all to the issue at hand: having a sick child left in a ward and not getting the treatment she needed because of a lack of cash and of doctors.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe behaviour of Johnson\u2019s army of trolls was quite despicable. They have displayed a shocking lack of human decency. So did those parts of the media who focussed on Mr Salem\u2019s political leanings rather than the issue at hand he sought to raise: the shortage of funds the hospital is grappling with courtesy of Johnson\u2019s minority Tory government and those that went before it.\n\nChoosing Whipps as a place to visit shows (once again) that his team really aren\u2019t as clever as they are reputed to be, and seem to think they are.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

And they go back a long way.\n\nThe signs were there in 2011, when the Tories were just getting started with austerity. That was when I was transferred there from the nearby Royal London, whose doctors and nurses saved my life after I was knocked off my bike and crushed under the wheels of a cement truck.\n\nI spent much of the first night at Whipps in agonising pain because a doctor couldn\u2019t be found to approve the meds, including morphine, I\u2019d been already prescribed at the Royal.\n\nI spent a weekend confined to my bed because, once again, a doctor couldn\u2019t be found to approve my transfer to a chair. That was just maddeningly frustrating as opposed to being a torture.\n\nBut you get the drift. You can perhaps see why Mr Salem\u2019s story, and his anger, resonated so strongly with me when I read about it.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t fix a problem by throwing money at it,\u201d is something you often hear from Conservatives. Looking back at its history it\u2019s clear that Whipps hasn\u2019t been terribly well run. In the period between my stay and that of Mr Salem\u2019s daughter, it became part of the huge Barts NHS Trust.\n\nIt spent four years in special measures after a devastating report by the Care Quality Commission back in 2015.\n\nBut it is also clearly needs money that it has been starved of by Johnson\u2019s party, by the governments of which he has been part.\n\nA doctor who met him during the fateful visit subsequently told the Guardian the place was held together by the hard work and dedication of staff, but that this couldn\u2019t be sustained.\n\nAs well as cash it needs people. Doctors, nurses, and other clinicians.\n\nTrouble is, they too are proving hard to find, once again thanks to Johnson\u2019s party, and its attempts to appeal to rightists and racists by stopping freedom of movement from the EU and introducing a hardline immigration policy.\n\nYesterday I was sent the details of a survey conducted by a consultancy called Prophet, which surveyed 12,200 consumers on 235 brands across 26 industries for its \u201cBrand Relevance Index\u201d.\n\nThe NHS topped the poll followed by Spotify, Netflix, PlayStation and Apple. That\u2019s some company it\u2019s in. People regularly tell pollsters they\u2019d pay a bit more tax to make it better, to give it what it needs: cash that the Conservatives have repeatedly denied it.\n\nFar from freeing up funds, the economic damage a no-deal Brexit his party plans to foist upon us may force a rapid reassessment of even the limited help the NHS has been promised.\n\nPerhaps the plan is to save some money by forcing those of us who need medication to jump on planes armed with our credit cards to buy it overseas. It might come to that.\n\nThe Conservative Party simply cannot be trusted with the NHS. It has proven it time and again. The story of Whipps Cross only adds to the weight of evidence against it.\n\nSo yes, Mr Salem is a Labour activist. But you might not even vote. And you might want to think twice about that, because it might be you in the position that confronted me, and Mr Salem and his daughter, next.", "description": "Ah spin doctors.
