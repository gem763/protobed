(AP) - North Carolina State has approved a two-year contract extension for men\u2019s basketball coach Kevin Keatts.\n\nThe deal announced Friday by the school keeps Keatts under contract through the 2025-26 season. The financial terms remain the same, meaning Keatts will continue to make $2.7 million per year.\n\nThe 47-year-old Keatts is 45-24 in two seasons at North Carolina State and led the Wolfpack to the NCAA Tournament in 2018. They missed the tournament last year after finishing 24-12 and playing in the NIT.\n\nThe school awarded him a new contract last November that increased his annual pay by $400,000.\n\nNew athletic director Boo Corrigan calls Keatts \u201ca tremendous leader for N.C. State,\u201d credits him for bringing consistency to the program and says he \u201cdoes it the right way.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "North Carolina State has approved a two-year contract extension for men's basketball coach Kevin Keatts.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
