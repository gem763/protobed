It's not the same thing.\"\n\nBehar claimed there wasn't any evidence of wrongdoing on the former vice president's part and that the \"worst thing\" he was accused of was nepotism.\n\n\"Trump's got three \u2014 how many relatives are [inaudible] in the White House? It's like they don't have any other place to live,\" she added.\n\nHunter Biden and his father have come under scrutiny for the former's work with Ukraine and the latter's attempt to get Ukraine's top prosecutor fired.

That request, according to Democrats, showed Trump trying to interfere in the 2020 presidential election.\n\n\"There's no proof to the fact that Hunter Biden did anything illegal,\" co-host Sunny Hostin said on Friday, \"and the other point is that Hunter Biden wasn't a member of the Obama administration whereas Ivanka Trump is a member of the administration \u2014 Jared Kushner is a member of the administration and they are benefiting from that administration. That's worse.\"\n\nFox News' Brooke Singman contributed to this report.", "description": "\"The View\" co-hosts got into a debate on Friday after one of them suggested that former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter's actions were just as troubling as the \"nepotism\" seen in\u00a0President Trump's family.", "authors": ["Sam Dorman", "Sam Dorman Is A Reporter With Fox News.
