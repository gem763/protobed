The city refused, but recovery has cost at least $18 million.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Baltimore Sun, http://www.baltimoresun.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A new audit says Baltimore's information technology department lost key data during May's ransomware attack because some of the agency's workers stored files on their individual computers rather than an external cloud system.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
