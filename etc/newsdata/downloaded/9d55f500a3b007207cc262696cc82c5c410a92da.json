The American Society of News Editors named reporters at The Indianapolis Star and staff of The Arizona Republic/USA TODAY NETWORK as winners of the 2018 ASNE Awards. The national ASNE Awards honor high-quality, high-impact journalism in 10 categories. This year\u2019s contest drew nearly 500 entries and was judged by leaders and journalism professionals from across the country.\n\nMarisa Kwiatkowski, Mark Alesia and Tim Evans of The Indianapolis Star won the O'Brien Fellowship Award for Impact in Public Service Journalism for the investigative series \u201cOut of Balance,\u201d which exposed USA Gymnastics\u2019 policy of not reporting all sexual abuse allegations against its coaches. The IndyStar team, overseen by editor Jeff Taylor \u2013 who was named executive editor of news at USA TODAY Wednesday, began its investigation into USA Gymnastics in 2016 and has continued breaking news about the story. Their reporting lead to the sentencing of former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar to 40 to 175 years in prison this January for sexually abusing athletes under the guise of medical treatment.\n\n\"Comprehensive and relentless reporting that permanently changed Americans' perceptions of high-level gymnastics and the people who run the sport. The Star committed itself to unraveling a culture in U.S. gymnastics that abetted widespread sex abuse of its athletes. Its exhaustive effort upended the USA Gymnastics hierarchy, spurred criminal convictions and the resignation of a university president,\u201d said the judges. \u201cIt built a framework, story by story, that exposed a pattern of abuse, the passing around of abusers, the silencing of accusers and a cover-up. When the story finally blew up over the Larry Nassar scandal, it seemed sudden to those not paying attention, but much credit goes to this series and the news organization that supported and published it for the far-reaching impact the story ultimately had.\"\n\nThe staff of The Arizona Republic/USA TODAY NETWORK won the Punch Sulzberger Award for Online Storytelling, which recognizes excellence and innovation in the use of digital tools to tell news stories, for the multi-platform report \"The Wall: Unknown Stories, Unintended Consequences.\u201d The groundbreaking project, led by The Arizona Republic\u2019s vice president of news and editor Nicole Carroll \u2013 who took over as editor in chief of USA TODAY earlier this month, examined President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign promise to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border using immersive technology, including aerial and 360-degree video, virtual reality, bots, drones, documentaries, photos, podcasts, and LiDAR data.\n\n\"The editors of the USA TODAY Network knew that the president's much-ballyhooed border wall was no mere abstraction. It's not a cliche to say that the immigration debate, on the ground, is one of blood, sweat and tears. This hyper-ambitious, thoroughly comprehensive online project recognizes that and gives voice and space and vision and context to the barrier's potential impact on both sides of the southern border,\u201d said the judges. \u201c'The Wall' made the most of its online-storytelling ambitions, ensuring that viewers can access and interact with the multi-pronged story in the way that is most comfortable for each individual: photos and text, of course, but also video, podcasts and VR. In encouraging viewers to 'choose your journey,' 'The Wall' put them almost directly in the shoes of those for whom the dangerous journey is not virtual reality but gritty reality.\"\n\nIn addition to the winners, the NETWORK had journalists recognized for their work as 2018 ASNE Awards finalists. Brett Murphy of USA TODAY was a finalist for the Dori J. Maynard Award for Justice in Journalism for the investigative series \"Rigged: Forced into debt. Worked past exhaustion. Left with nothing,\u201d which examined the exploitive truck leases used by short-haul trucking companies at California ports. John Schmid of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel was also a finalist for the Dori J. Maynard Award for Justice in Journalism for his \u201cA Time to Heal\u201d series addressing how far Milwaukee has come since the 1967 Civil Rights marches. For the O'Brien Fellowship Award for Impact in Public Service Journalism, Raquel Rutledge of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel was named a finalist for the \u201cMexico Blackouts\u201d investigation.\n\n\u201cAll of these projects illustrate how newsrooms truly work to serve the American people. The reporters and staff who worked on these projects fulfilled USA TODAY NETWORK\u2019s commitment to impactful journalism, and that\u2019s an accomplishment in and of itself,\u201d said Randy Lovely, vice president for community news for the USA TODAY NETWORK. \u201cIt is, of course, also wonderful to see our reporters and staff earn recognition from such a prestigious national organization for their work as well.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2GB0zxN", "description": "Reporters at The Indianapolis Star and staff of The Arizona Republic/USA TODAY NETWORK were named winners of the\u00a02018 ASNE Awards.", "authors": ["Staff", "Usa Today Network Pressroom", "Published P.M.
