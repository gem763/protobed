And it\u2019s quite possible that a third color \u2014 neutral to either team \u2014 will be the among the most prevalent hues worn by those inside Sanford Stadium: pink.\n\nVictory won\u2019t be the only priority for some Bulldogs fans this week. Over just a few days, a contingent has banded together to pay tribute to the opposing team\u2019s coach, Blake Anderson, whose wife Wendy died Aug. 19 following a two-year battle with breast cancer. Anderson began a 19-day leave of absence on the day of her death yet made a surprising and emotional return for last Saturday\u2019s game against the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. His Red Wolves won, 43-17.\n\nWendy Anderson\u2019s death resonated with many, among them, University of Georgia alum and Bulldogs mega fan Dwight Standridge. He\u2019s the fundraising chairman for Athens-based Bulldogs Battling Breast Cancer, a nonprofit whose proceeds go toward helping women detect breast cancer before it can metastasize. Standridge, 49, told The Washington Post he learned of coach Anderson\u2019s story while reading a blog in preparation for Saturday\u2019s game.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a guy [who] writes every week on reasons Georgia should hate their opponent,\u201d Standridge recalled. \u201cThis week, he said, \u2018I can\u2019t find a reason for Georgia to hate Arkansas State, given their coach just went through this traumatic experience.\u2019 It just shows a different side of human nature \u2014 human kindness.\u201d\n\nStandridge was referring to a weekly column published by Graham Coffey on SBNation\u2019s fan site dedicated to Georgia football, Dawg Sports. On Monday Coffey explained how much he was touched by Anderson\u2019s story in the aptly titled: \u201cWhy I DON\u2019T Hate Arkansas State.\u201d\n\n[Georgia football has gone from good to great, but the stats won\u2019t tell you that]\n\n\u201cI have been through some things in my life that I consider painful, but I cannot even begin to fathom what Blake Anderson has been going through for the last two years,\u201d Coffey, who did not return an email requesting comment, wrote. \u201cIt is even harder for me to fathom what he\u2019s going through right now.\u201d\n\nSeveral people in the blog\u2019s comment section agreed, and the #WearPinkForWendy hashtag was born. Soon after, Coffey created a graphic to encourage those attending Saturday\u2019s game to wear some form of pink in honor of Wendy Anderson.\n\nThe message aligned perfectly with the efforts of Bulldogs Battling Breast Cancer, who already had a \u201cpink out\u201d event planned for Georgia\u2019s Oct. 19 game against Kentucky, Standridge said. He posted the image to the nonprofit\u2019s Twitter account Tuesday morning with the accompanying hashtags.\n\nThen, Standridge says, his tweet \u201ctook on a mind of its own.\u201d\n\nIt has since garnered more than 1,000 retweets and even caught the attention of Arkansas State University System President Chuck Welch, who tweeted the image with the caption, \u201cIncredibly classy move by Georgia. It\u2019s about more than just a game.\u201d\n\nLater that day, the official Georgia Football Twitter account quote-tweeted the image along with #WearPinkForWendy. Anderson took notice too, tweeting that he was \u201cbeyond grateful\u201d for the Georgia fans\u2019 initiative.\n\nBeyond grateful... thank you \ud83d\udc95 https://t.co/lfqZr48ZhJ \u2014 Blake Anderson (@CHbanderson) September 10, 2019\n\n\u201cIt really shows you the power of social media when people take this and run with it, and keep retweeting it and sharing it \u2014 it multiplies exponentially in the scope of people that you reach,\u201d Standridge said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a positive movement, and any kind of positive light we can shine on the issue of breast cancer awareness is just awesome.\u201d\n\nEven though putting together Saturday\u2019s tribute was by all accounts a last-minute, grass roots affair, Standridge is optimistic about how many fans will participate. Sanford Stadium seats about 90,000 people. He hopes at least 20,000 to 30,000 of those in attendance will wear pink in honor of coach Anderson.\n\nStandridge, who attends every Bulldogs home game, said he still expects Georgia fans to adamantly cheer on their team. On paper, the Bulldogs should have no trouble taking down Arkansas State (Georgia is a 33.5-point favorite), but this weekend, he said, fans will come in with perspective that overshadows winning.\n\nA perspective that is bigger than football entirely.\n\n\u201cJust because you\u2019re a Bulldogs fan doesn\u2019t mean you have to hate the opposing team,\u201d he said. \u201cI think this week the Bulldogs fans will step up and show that side of human nature: rallying for a common good and supporting the team across the sidelines.\u201d\n\nRead More:\n\nKent State ended a women\u2019s field hockey game for football fireworks.
