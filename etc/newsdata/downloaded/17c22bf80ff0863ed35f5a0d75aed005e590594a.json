The time period when all this homewrecking occurred was during the Obama presidency, and when AG\u2019s like Kamala Harris were on the job,'' he said. \"It happened on her watch. And she\u2019s never been really forced to tell the other story -- and wrestle with the truth of what happened..\u201d\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. | Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Photo\n\nIn California, Mnuchin \u2014 now the Treasury secretary \u2014 acquired regional banks like OneWest with the federal government\u2019s help; the banks got billions in subsidies as they foreclosed on 35,000 homeowners in the Golden State alone, Glantz reports. Harris did little to stop that bleeding \u2014 and later tried to suppress evidence of her inaction, he argues.\n\n\u201cHarris\u2019 deputies recommended that their boss sue the bank,\u2019\u2019 Glantz said, citing the bank\u2019s loss-share agreement with the FDIC, which stated that Mnuchin\u2019s bank could only receive payments from the government if it followed proper foreclosure procedures. \u201cIf the state of California found OneWest violated those rules, the payments could stop \u2013 saving not only homeowners...but government coffers as well.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201c[But] despite a strong recommendation from her staff,\u2019\u2019 Harris never legally pursued Mnuchin\u2019s OneWest bank, he says. \u201cAs a result, no one at OneWest faced prosecution \u2014 and no one got their homes back.\u201d\n\nIan Sams, spokesman for Harris\u2019 presidential campaign, responded forcefully to the charges in Glantz\u2019s book.\n\n\u201cNo attorney general in America got more from the banks for their state's homeowners than Kamala Harris; she won $20 billion for Californians from the biggest banks,\u2019\u2019 he said in a statement to POLITICO. \u201cShe also got another $1 billion from the banks when she pursued a securities fraud case which centered on money defrauded from pension funds. She then passed a pioneering Homeowner's Bill of Rights and created a Mortgage Fraud Strike Force.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was no question OneWest conducted predatory lending, and Senator Harris believes they should be punished,\u2019\u2019 Sams said. \u201cUnfortunately, the law was squarely on their side and they were shielded from state subpoenas because they're a federal bank. This shouldn't be surprising by how much influence the financial industry has wielded in Washington, but Senator Harris has introduced a bill to fix this.\u201d\n\nCalifornia Playbook Our must-read briefing on politics and government in the Golden State.

On bigger fish, however, her staff \u201cdid investigate OneWest, and did recommend prosecution \u2014 but she did bury their report and declined to launch a prosecution,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cThat happened.\u201d\n\nGlantz writes in \u201cHomewreckers\u201d that \u201cthe only reason we know about California\u2019s investigations into OneWest today is because David Dayen of the news website The Intercept obtained a leaked copy,\u2019\u2019 and published it in January 2017. \u201cBy then,\u2019\u2019 Glantz reports, \u201cHarris was no longer California attorney general \u2014 she was a U.S. senator.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/79/ae/6c08c7f44436af5e97060b48fa19/191021-kamala-harris-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
