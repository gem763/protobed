There is just no excuse for entrepreneurs in Japan, myself included.\u201d\n\nSon built a $13.8 billion personal fortune by transforming SoftBank into a global technology conglomerate and reaping massive returns from investments like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. His $100 billion Vision Fund also holds stakes in some of the world\u2019s biggest technology startups, a portfolio that ranges from ride-hailing and genomics to vertical farms and satellites. But trouble at two of SoftBank\u2019s marquee investments -- Uber Technologies Inc. and WeWork -- has cast a shadow of doubt over the Japanese billionaire\u2019s track record just as he\u2019s busy wooing investors for an even bigger fund.\n\n\u201cIt only just began and I feel there is tremendous potential there,\u201d Son told Nikkei Business. The strategy is to invest in companies that share his vision of a world being reshaped by artificial intelligence, he said.\n\nSon has often said that he has a 30-year plan for SoftBank and that his vision extends as far out as 300 years into the future. But his company\u2019s shares have been battered by more immediate concerns, now trading at close to 31% lower than they were in April.\n\nUber\u2019s share price has also suffered a more than 30% drop from the level at which the company went public, raising questions about the rest of SoftBank\u2019s ride-hailing portfolio, which includes China\u2019s Didi Chuxing Inc., India\u2019s Ola and Singapore\u2019s Grab. WeWork, a co-working giant into which Son has poured almost $11 billion, has had to delay what would have been one of the year\u2019s biggest initial public offerings as the market balked at its inflated valuation and shaky governance. This one-two punch has helped erase the gains of SoftBank\u2019s record $5.5 billion buyback eight months ago.\n\nSoftBank Gives \u2018Very Public Lesson\u2019 to Founders in WeWork Ouster\n\nWeWork and Uber may be losing money now, but they will be substantially profitable in 10 years\u2019 time, Son said in the interview. At a private retreat for portfolio companies late last month he had a different message: become profitable soon. At the gathering, held at the five-star Langham resort in Pasadena, California, Son also stressed the importance of good governance. Just days later, SoftBank led the ouster of WeWork\u2019s controversial co-founder Adam Neumann.\n\nSon has long been known as a free-spending benefactor who encouraged startup founders to pursue their dreams even if it meant losing billions of dollars in the process. While the Nikkei interview focused mostly on Son\u2019s disappointment with flagging entrepreneurial spirits in his home country, it did include a somewhat cryptic note of caution for SoftBank portfolio company heads.\n\n\u201cRecently, I\u2019ve been telling founders to \u2018know your limit,\u2019\u201d Son said. \u201cKnowing your limitations will help unleash limitless possibilities.\u201d\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Pavel Alpeyev in Tokyo at palpeyev@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Peter Elstrom at pelstrom@bloomberg.net, Vlad Savov\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp.\u2019s Masayoshi Son says he is unhappy with how far short his accomplishments to date have fallen of his goals.\u201cThe results still have a long way to go and that makes me embarrassed and impatient,\u201d Son said in an interview with Nikkei Business. \u201cI used to envy the scale", "authors": ["Pavel Alpeyev"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Bmj9WtKCCf2LPQoXv.K4kg--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_technology_68/748cadbcbd2836b830395681c47bd5cf", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
