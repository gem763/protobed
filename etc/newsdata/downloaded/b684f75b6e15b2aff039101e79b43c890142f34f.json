Portsmouth, 1974\n\nAt the turn of the millennium Meadows adopted new \u2018kitchen table\u2019 technologies to make digital stories, or what he called \u2018multimedia sonnets from the people\u2019.\n\nHe returned to some of those he had photographed, listening to how they had changed and through their stories, creating a commentary on life in Britain and how much it has changed since he began his life\u2019s work.\n\nMeadows said: 'My rule of thumb when doing documentary work is always to try to treat people as individuals, not types.'\n\nMeadows' incredible images include twin brothers pictured as children in 1974 and again 21 years later, as well as sisters Lyn and Stella Brasher, photographed in 1974 and again in 1999.\n\nThe photographs showcased in the book also form an eye-opening exhibition at Oxford's Bodleian Libraries.\n\nThe exhibition is comprised of 17 pairs of portraits and 16 short films about his subjects as well as news clippings showing how Meadows reached out via local media to find his subjects.\n\nFriends Ken Emery and Ed Murphy, from Southampton, pictured in 1974 and again in 2000\n\nLyn and Stella Brasher, sisters from Hampshire, pictured in 1974 and 1999\n\nMother and daughter Karen Cubin and Barbara Taylor, from Barrow-in-Furness, photographed in 1974 and 1995\n\nMary Clarke, from Hartlepool, left in 1974 and right in 1998.

He is one of our great documentary photographers. His work is both concerned and humane, and engages individuals and communities thoughtfully and sympathetically.\n\n'His body of work, stretching for almost fifty years, charts major social changes in Britain, but always has the lives and lived experiences of people at its heart. Through his photographs, videos and other material from his archive, Daniel provides a unique perspective on British society in recent decades.\n\n'We are truly honoured to have been gifted his archive which will be a major resource for scholars, and an inspiration for photographers.'", "description": "A group of bootboys are among the 'great ordinary' captured by documentary photographer Daniel Meadows, who has sought to showcase 'the extraordinary aspects of ordinary life' across Britain.", "authors": ["Amie Gordon For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/11/20077886-0-image-a-48_1571825815300.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
