No One Can Figure Out Brexit So Morgan Stanley Let a Machine Try\n\n(Bloomberg) -- To the army of strategists, economists and investors grappling with Brexit: Relax. Take a break. Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) quants have your back.\n\nThe Wall Street bank has unleashed its computer model to map the fallout from Britain\u2019s tortuous bid to leave the European Union, one of the most intractable issues in world finance.\n\nThe good news: The hit to assets in a no-deal exit isn\u2019t as bad as some fear. The bad: It\u2019s still pretty ugly, and Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) sees a 35% chance it will happen.\n\nHere\u2019s what the model said about the worst-case scenario in a report published Monday:\n\nIn equities, a no-deal Brexit will likely have a negative impact on European and U.K. stocks in the short term, but declines will be moderate (single-digit) rather than severe (double-digit). European earnings per share could drop as much as 5-6%; the has downside potential of 3-5%.\n\nIn currencies, investors selling risk assets following a no-deal could spur a bid for the euro, a hot funding currency, cushioning its fall. The Swiss franc should rally.\n\nIn government bonds, Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) anticipates a widening of about 25-35 basis points in the Irish 10-year spread relative to Belgium, Austria and Finland, while the spread to Bunds could potentially rise to 100 basis points.\n\n(NYSE: ) anticipates a widening of about 25-35 basis points in the Irish 10-year spread relative to Belgium, Austria and Finland, while the spread to Bunds could potentially rise to 100 basis points. German government bonds will likely take their direction from gilts, with yields for the latter possibly rising.\n\nIn corporate bonds, the ECB\u2019s stimulus program should cushion non-financial debt somewhat. The team sees room for greater volatility in the assets that are not directly supported by the ECB\u2019s purchases like high yield and corporate hybrids.\n\nTo reach its conclusions, Morgan Stanley used an \u201cinput-output\u201d framework to simulate how a change in demand in one country can be traced back through the sectors and countries that provide inputs into the final product. That allowed the firm to sketch out in fine detail a Brexit trading book.\n\nIn the process, it also helped them nab the award for understated headline of the year:\n\n\u201cExecutive summary: Brexit is an important downside risk.\u201d", "description": "No One Can Figure Out Brexit So Morgan Stanley Let a Machine Try", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPED2R0VU_L.jpg"}
