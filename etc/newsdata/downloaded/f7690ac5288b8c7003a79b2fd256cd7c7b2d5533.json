The move comes amid a wide-ranging trade dispute between the U.S. and China, which has led to new tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of goods.\n\nSmith says the \"message here is that one of the ways the U.S. and China can collaborate together is to ensure that forced labor is not used.\"\n\nShe said the companies can re-export the detained shipments or submit information to show they're legal.\n\nThe companies sanctioned are Bonechar Carv\u00e3o Ativado Do Brasil Ltda; Hetian Taida Apparel Co., Ltd. in Xinjiang, China and WRP Asia Pacific Sdn. Bhd. in Malaysia. The action also covers gold mined at small artisan mines in eastern Congo and rough diamonds from the Marange diamond fields in Zimbabwe.\n\nZimbabwe's government in a statement called the U.S. decision \"a blatant and shameless lie.\" The Marange region was in the spotlight a decade ago over alleged army killings of artisanal miners and forced labor. The fields are now commercially mined.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis story has been updated to correct that Zimbabwe action is against a region, not a company.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
