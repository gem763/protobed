China says 'no' to Joe Biden probe\n\nTrump says no cooperation: Donald Trump to Nancy Pelosi: No cooperation in 'partisan' impeachment investigation\n\nIf the White House does not comply with a subpoena, the House could file a civil lawsuit, or hold people in contempt of Congres. It is unclear what ability Congress has to enforce its subpoenas, though.\n\nHere are all of the officials or individuals who have been subpoenaed or asked to provide information to congressional investigators since House Democrats announced their formal impeachment inquiry on Sept. 24.\n\nEnergy Secretary Rick Perry (Oct. 10)\n\nThe House Oversight, Intelligence, and Foreign Affairs committees subpoenaed Energy Secretary Rick Perry on Oct. 10 for documents relating to House Democrats' impeachment inquiry.\n\nCongressional Democrats saw Perry as playing a role in \"reinforcing the President's stark message to the Ukrainian President,\" the committees said in a letter.\n\nGiuliani associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman (Oct. 10)\n\nLev Parnas and Igor Fruman, associates of Rudy Giuliani and Ukrainian-born business partners, were subpoenaed for documents relating to the impeachment inquiry on Oct. 10.\n\nThey were arrested on Oct. 9 on campaign finance charges and had been among the witnesses congressional investigators had hoped to question. The men helped Giuliani meet a Ukrainian prosecutor as part of Giuliani's push for an investigation into Biden.\n\nTheir federal indictment alleges they \u201cconspired to circumvent the federal laws against foreign influence by engaging in a scheme to funnel foreign money to candidates for federal and state office so that the defendants could buy potential influence with candidates, campaigns and the candidates\u2019 governments.\u201d\n\nEuropean Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland (Oct. 8)\n\nGordon Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, was scheduled to meet with congressional investigators on Oct. 7 but was directed by the White House not to hold the meeting.\n\nSondland had been at the center of text messages released as part of Ukrainian envoy Kurt Volker's testimony to Congress last week, and lawmakers on both parties had been looking forward to hearing from Sondland before his testimony was canceled.\n\n\"I would love to send Ambassador Sondland, a really good man and great American, to testify, but unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court, where Republican\u2019s rights have been taken away, and true facts are not allowed out for the public,\" Trump tweeted Tuesday morning.\n\nIn response, House Democrats issued a subpoena in an attempt to compel Sondland's testimony and to force the release of text messages or emails on one of his personal devices.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper/The Pentagon (Oct. 7)\n\nHouse Democrats also sought information from Defense Secretary Mark Esper on any relevant information on the withholding of military aid to Ukraine\n\nThey issued a subpoena to Esper and the Department of Defense on Oct. 7.\n\nActing Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought (Oct. 7)\n\nIn response to media reports that Trump had ordered then-acting OMB Director Mick Mulvaney to halt military aid to Ukraine, House Democrats issued a subpoena on Oct. 7.\n\nSpeaking to reporters outside the White House on Wednesday Vought said he and his office would not be cooperating in the impeachment inquiry.\n\nActing White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney/The White House (Oct. 4)\n\nHouse Democrats sent a letter on Oct. 4 to acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney carrying subpoenas related to documents relating to the impeachment inquiry.
