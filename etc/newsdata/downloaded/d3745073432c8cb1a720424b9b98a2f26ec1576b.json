She will continue to cooperate with the investigation,\" the statement continued.\n\n\"Anne would like to meet with Mr Dunn's parents so that she can express her deepest sympathies and apologies for this tragic accident.\n\n\"We have been in contact with the family's attorneys and look forward to hearing from them.\"\n\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab wrote to Mr Dunn's family on Saturday to explain both the British and US governments now considered Mrs Sacoolas' immunity irrelevant.\n\nThe letter said: \"We have pressed strongly for a waiver of immunity, so that justice can be done... Whilst the US government has steadfastly declined to give that waiver, that is not the end of the matter.\n\n\"We have looked at this very carefully... the UK government's position is that immunity, and therefore any question of waiver, is no longer relevant in Mrs Sacoolas' case, because she has returned home.\n\n\"The US have now informed us that they too consider that immunity is no longer pertinent.\"\n\nImage copyright PA Media Image caption Radd Seiger (centre) has travelled to the US ahead of Harry Dunn's parents\n\nIn response to the letter, Mr Dunn's mother, Charlotte Charles, said: \"We've known from the start that the \"extra\" feeling in the pit of our tummies, told us that something wasn't right.\n\n\"We're proud of ourselves for fighting for justice for Harry, and not ignoring this gnawing within our bodies.\n\n\"We'd rather have our beautiful boy back, but we are also elated that all this fighting for justice for Harry has not been in vain.\n\n\"We'll continue to fight for change to the diplomatic immunity laws and any other positive changes we can achieve.\"\n\nWhat is diplomatic immunity?\n\nAbout 23,000 individuals in the UK have diplomatic immunity, a status reserved for foreign diplomats and their families, as long as they don't have British citizenship.\n\nIt means that, in theory, they cannot face court proceedings for any crime or civil case.\n\nHowever, where crimes are committed, the Foreign Office can ask a foreign government to waive immunity.\n\nDiplomatic immunity is by no means restricted to those named on the Diplomatic List. Drivers, cooks and other support staff who have been accredited to Britain (\"the receiving state\") have the same diplomatic status and immunity.\n\nEarlier, the lawyer for Mr Dunn's family, Radd Seiger, appealed for anyone with information about Mrs Sacoolas' return to the United States to come forward.\n\nMr Dunn's parents, who have previously said they are considering civil action against Mrs Sacoolas, are set to fly out to the US on Sunday and will visit both New York and Washington DC.\n\nMr Seiger said they would be \"engaging with the media and politicians as they reach out for support from all Americans and to ask them to put pressure on the US administration to do the right thing\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Harry Dunn's Kawasaki motorcycle was involved in a crash with a Volvo near RAF Croughton in August\n\nOn Friday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the US was \"absolutely ruthless\" in its safeguarding of Mrs Sacoolas following the decision to grant her diplomatic immunity.\n\nHe said although President Donald Trump was sympathetic towards Mr Dunn's family's views on the use of diplomatic immunity, the US was \"very reluctant\" to allow citizens to be tried abroad.\n\nThat followed the revelation that Mrs Sacoolas would not return to the UK when briefing notes held by Mr Trump were photographed at a White House news conference.\n\nChief Constable of Northamptonshire Police Nick Adderley has said the investigation into the crash will continue.\n\nThe force has said CCTV of the crash in which Mr Dunn died shows a Volvo travelling on the wrong side of the road.", "description": "Anne Sacoolas breaks her silence as UK and US officials say diplomatic immunity no longer applies.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6A72/production/_109205272_harry_dunn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
