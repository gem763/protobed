They fired a green flare as they started pulling back, all under the gaze of observers from the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe. The operation must be completed within three days.\n\nOriginally slated for October 7, the joint withdrawal was delayed as both sides accused each other of violating the ceasefire that has frequently been broken since 2015. The Ukrainian military accused the separatists of firing machine guns and grenades at a position near Zolote on Tuesday, but later said the clash occurred outside the withdrawal area.\n\nThe Zolote and Petrovske stand-downs were first planned at a meeting in Minsk of representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the separatists as part of an effort by recently elected president Volodymyr Zelenskiy to revitalise the stalled peace process.\n\nVolunteer soldiers affiliated with a far-right group argued against the withdrawal in a heated meeting with Mr Zelenskiy when he visited Zolote last week.\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskiy meets soldiers at a position in the Donetsk region earlier this month Credit: Ukrainian Presidential Press Service via Reuters More\n\nNationalists have also been protesting the \u201cSteinmeier formula\u201d agreed in Minsk, which foresees free elections in the separatist areas in exchange for a special status on autonomy.\n\nMr Zelenskiy has been pushing to reconvene the Normandy format involving the leaders of France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine for peace talks.\n\nMr Prystaiko said not all participants had agreed on a preliminary date set for the talks but Kyiv hopes they would take place in November.\n\nThe Kremlin signalled on Tuesday it was ready to come to the negotiating table if both withdrawals were successfully completed.\n\n\u201cIf everything works out in Zolote, similar procedures must immediately be taken in Petrovske,\u201d said Vladislav Surkov, an aide to Vladimir Putin. \u201cAfter that, without slowing down, preparations for the Normandy summit must be started.\u201d\n\nMr Zelenskiy showed a willingness to negotiate by calling Vladimir Putin in July and pushed through prisoner swap with Russia involving 70 people in September. He also oversaw a troop withdrawal and reconstruction of a bridge between government and separatist areas in Stanytsia Luhanska.\n\nDespite backing the \u201cSteinmeier formula,\u201d the sides have differed on the details, with the separatists pushing back against Kyiv's insistance that the border with Russia first be brought back under its control.\n\nMore than 10,000 people have been killed since separatists seized cities in eastern Ukraine in 2014.", "description": "The Ukrainian government and Russia-backed separatists have begun withdrawing forces from an eastern Ukraine town in a step toward new peace talks with Moscow over the five-year conflict. \u00a0 At an investment forum on Tuesday in Mariupol, a city near separatist-held areas, foreign minister Vadym Prystaiko", "authors": ["Alec Luhn"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/x7EyCdPeMExTrgXoGnQ.uA--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_258/d97749c7f382c225f518472a13e2be65", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
