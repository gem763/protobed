More\n\nMore than 99% of 263 firms and agent websites surveyed did not list commission rates. Even among local Multiple Listing Services, listing aggregators not sponsored by specific brokerages, \u201cnearly all\u201d restricted access about commissions, the study found.\n\n\u201cIf you look at a savings account, there is extensive information about all the details and costs and interest rates paid. The same thing would be true for a loan. For auto insurance, you can get individual quotes. But here, you can\u2019t find any mention in the large majority of websites of consumer costs,\u201d said Brobeck.\n\nBrobeck noted that Pacific Northwest MLS now allows brokers to disclose commission splits on individual properties, and Redfin has also agreed to do so. A commission split occurs when there is a buyer and seller broker, forcing them to share the commission.\n\nBut brokers took issue with the allegations, saying that commissions are fluid and negotiable \u2014 something that\u2019s not easy to convey on a website.\n\n\u201cCommission is not something that\u2019s set in stone, like a jacket in the store window. When it comes to commissions, they vary, and that\u2019s really the truth\u2026 This is a relationship business. It\u2019s a little more complicated than this study makes it,\u201d said Bess Freedman, CEO of Brown Harris Stevens.\n\nMovement to disclose commissions\n\nBrokerages were also hesitant to share commission prices over the phone, the study found. Less than a fourth of brokerages disclosed rates in response to general phone inquiries, according to the study. Almost all firms eventually disclosed the commission rate when they were pushed by the CFA, which posed as home sellers in a second round of calls for the study.\n\nThe National Association of Realtors (NAR) disputed the CFA\u2019s findings, saying that 2018 data shows brokers most often initiated conversations about compensation.\n\n\u201cNAR considers transparency critical to an ethical negotiation with a prospective seller or buyer, including how commissions are calculated. We encourage brokers to have a conversation with their prospective clients about commissions at the very beginning of the relationship,\u201d said Mantill Williams, vice president of communications at the NAR.\n\nBrokers said that they provide information about compensation on closing sheets, managing expectations along the way. \u201cWe\u2019re always honest about commissions, or they wouldn\u2019t hire us. Clients need to know what the costs are... Transparency is a must,\u201d said Freedman.\n\nBrobeck said he thinks disclosure will someday be expected of the entire industry, citing a class action anti-trust lawsuit against the NAR over buyer broker commissions, which challenged the practice of split commissions.
