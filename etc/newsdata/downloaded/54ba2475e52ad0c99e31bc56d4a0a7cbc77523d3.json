The cleats were adorned with Beckham's initials and were made out of goat hair, a reference to the GOAT status Beckham believes Brady holds.\n\nThe two were surrounded by cameras during the exchange, and at least one photo of the interaction shows Beckham's own quarterback, Mayfield, watching in the background.\n\n\n\n\n\nFans on Twitter were quick to point out how envious Mayfield seemed to look as he watched his star receiver hand over the shoes.\n\nSome referred to Mayfield as Beckham's \"pissed off girlfriend,\" while others believe the moment indicates that the wide receiver wishes he were catching passes from Brady, instead.\n\nEven NFL Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe weighed in, saying Mayfield looked like he wanted to \"knock them shoes out of Odell's hands,\" followed by a string of crying-laughing emojis.\n\nStory continues\n\nBrady and Beckham reportedly spent even more time with each other after the game.
