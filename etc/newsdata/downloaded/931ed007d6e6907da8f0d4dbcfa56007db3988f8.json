Especially considering the AirPods Pro were quietly announced rather than launching during a major Apple event.\n\nThe AirPods Pro differentiate themselves from the regular AirPods with a new design for a better in-ear fit and features like active noise-cancelling, water and sweat resistance, and supposedly better audio quality.\n\nThe lines are a testament to the success and popularity of Apple's AirPods.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nPeople lined up to buy Apple's new $250 AirPods Pro at certain Apple stores on Wednesday morning when the wireless noise-cancelling earbuds were released.\n\nThis is ... unusual. Lines for new iPhones, sure. But for headphones? I can't think of a pair of headphones that got so much interest that it caused people to line up to buy them.\n\nThere's no indication that anyone camped out overnight to get hold of the new AirPods, as sometimes happens with new iPhone releases. And not every Apple Store in the world had lines of people waiting to try the company's new earbuds.\n\nBut the fact that there were lines at all suggests healthy demand for Apple's new AirPods.\n\nCheck out some of the Apple Store locations where people lined up to buy a new pair of $250 earbuds:", "description": "The lines aren't quite as extensive as those for new iPhones, but before Apple's new AirPods Pro, I had never seen people line up to buy headphones.", "authors": ["Antonio Villas-Boas"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db9d18bdee0192ec3409562?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
