REUTERS/Charles Platiau/File Photo\n\nInvestors and analysts are keeping close tabs on Societe Generale\u2019s progress in a disposal program that should help boost its common equity tier one ratio - a key measure of financial strength - by 80-90 basis points.\n\nThe unit, known as SG Finans, focuses on equipment finance solutions and has 358 employees overall in Norway, Sweden and Denmark.\n\nBank of America is leading the sale, one of the sources said.\n\nSocGen\u2019s executives believe the business is too isolated and does not provide enough synergies for the group, another source with direct knowledge of the matter said.\n\nSocGen and Bank of America declined to comment.\n\nSG Finans had 38.3 billion Norwegian crowns ($4.19 billion) of assets as of end-2018. Its profit before tax fell to 738 million Norwegian crowns ($80.34 million) in 2018 from 853 million Norwegian crowns a year before.\n\nSocGen, along with other European banks, has to find ways to cope with a negative interest environment that curtails returns for retail activities and with difficult market conditions that hurt investment banking profits.\n\nThe French lender is also trying to flip a portfolio of non-performing loans linked to small and mid-sized companies to private equity investors, two sources said.\n\nSocGen has gone through some tough times since the beginning of 2018 when it settled costly legal disputes. Its then head of investment banking left as a result.\n\nSince then, its share price slid to a 7-year low of 21.2 euros per share in June, recovering slightly to 26.4 euros as of 0830 GMT on Wednesday thanks to the bank\u2019s efforts to keep capital ratios on track with its targets.\n\nThe European banking index .SX7P is down by 2.8% in the past year, outperforming SocGen\u2019s share price, which has fallen more than 20% in that period.\n\nSocGen is to report third-quarter results on Nov. 6.", "description": "France's Societe Generale has put its leasing unit in the Nordics up for sale as part of a plan to exit non-strategic businesses and keep capital ratios strong, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.", "authors": ["Maya Nikolaeva", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444159117&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M1HS", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
