Sign up for the Today\u2019s WorldView newsletter.\n\nThe People\u2019s Republic of China is marking its big birthday in the only way it knows how \u2014 a giant parade with lots of weapons. By the time you read this, fighter jets have likely already roared across the Beijing sky, thousands of soldiers goose-stepped down the capital\u2019s boulevards, stealth drones whirred above, followed by columns of tanks and trucks bearing sophisticated new intercontinental ballistic missiles.\n\nBut, also by the time you read this, there will have been an altogether different set of commemorations in Hong Kong. Even as local authorities in the former British colony ceremonially raised the Chinese flag, new protests flared down its streets as an emboldened pro-democracy movement sought to puncture the central government\u2019s great day of national unity and celebration.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping may hope the choreographed pomp in Beijing will obscure the scenes of unrest elsewhere. On the eve of festivities, he bowed three times before a statue of Mao Zedong, the late revolutionary and the first leader of the Communist republic forged in 1949 after years of conflict. In the decades since, China has in many ways left behind Mao\u2019s Marxist-Leninist legacy: Its tech companies are cutting edge; its state enterprises are worldwide juggernauts; its exports have reshaped the global economy; its middle class is as hyper-materialist as they come.\n\nChina will celebrate the 70th anniversary of Communist Party rule on Oct. 1.

More than his recent predecessors, he has adopted the doctrinaire rhetoric of the \u201cstruggle\u201d and built a cult of personality around his rule, adding his name to the country\u2019s constitution and dissolving term limits. That elevation of Xi\u2019s own status has accompanied a tightening grip under his watch. The protests in Hong Kong may seem the most direct, vociferous challenge to Beijing\u2019s rule, but there are ripples of disquiet across the mainland.\n\n\u201cTo stamp out dissent, the party has cracked down on lawyers, human rights activists and other members of civil society,\u201d Fifield wrote. \u201cIt has overseen a sweeping campaign to forcibly assimilate ethnic minorities, detaining about 1 million Uighurs in re-education camps in Xinjiang. Xi has steered an anti-corruption campaign so extensive that it has led to the arrest of more than 1.5 million people. \u201d\n\nXi is firmly ensconced in power, but he\u2019s never far away from the fear of losing it. \u201cThe history of the People\u2019s Republic of China is one of aspiration, destruction, ambition, confidence and anxiety,\u201d said Klaus M\u00fchlhahn, professor of Chinese history at the Free University of Berlin, to Fifield. \u201cI think a lot of Chinese policy is driven by fear. This fear of losing power, of a development similar to what happened in the Soviet Union, shapes much of the policy and thinking.\u201d\n\nThose anxieties have intensified amid a worrying economic slowdown, one that has also been compounded by an aggressive American trade war and a hardening anti-China consensus in Washington and other Western capitals.\n\nIn a conversation with Today\u2019s WorldView last week, Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong suggested Xi and China\u2019s leadership need to think beyond the \u201cpowerful narrative\u201d they peddle at commemorations such as Tuesday\u2019s 70th anniversary: It\u2019s a story anchored in historical grievance and tragedy, bemoaning China\u2019s misfortune at the hands of foreign invaders, only to be redeemed by seven decades of plucky, resolute communist rule.\n\nBut China, Lee implied, is no longer a victim on the world stage \u2014 and it can\u2019t face the rest of the world from such a position.\n\n\u201cI think they understand intellectually that they have a problem,\u201d Lee said of China\u2019s leadership. The challenge for them is \u201cto pull the pieces together and decide how to make a calibrated and controlled repositioning without being stampeded into giving up ground.\u201d He sees Xi as a political figure who has assumed greater authority and powers to push through policies \u201che feels are essential to get done.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe risk, of course, is that if it is more centralized,\u201d said Lee, \u201ca lot more depends on the right decisions being made right at the center.\u201d\n\nA thorny problem lies in China\u2019s domestic disturbances. This year marked other significant anniversaries, too: It\u2019s three decades since the bloody crackdown at Tiananmen Square and five years since a new generation of pro-democracy protesters first took to the streets in Hong Kong. \u201cThese internal cohesion issues, I think worry them because they do not see any easy way of dealing with any of them,\u201d said Lee, referring to the protests in Hong Kong and the crackdown in Xinjiang.\n\n\"A lot of people are expecting the next few days to be very turbulent\" - Special correspondent Alex Crawford reports from Hong Kong where police have dispersed protesters.\n\n\n\nOn 1 October the People's Republic of China will celebrate its 70th anniversary: https://t.co/luo9fyGG9P pic.twitter.com/Pw9Q0BGR4K \u2014 Sky News (@SkyNews) September 28, 2019\n\nThe Singaporean leader doesn\u2019t think Xi or his allies would countenance a repeat of 1989 with a military intervention into Hong Kong. \u201cThis will be worse if they have to go in that way, and what will they do with Hong Kong after that?\u201d Lee asked. \u201cYou have destroyed Hong Kong. I think China is now in a dilemma \u2014 how do you hope that this comes down without them getting overly involved?\u201d\n\nTo be sure, Hong Kong\u2019s protests aren\u2019t exactly an existential threat to Xi and his cohort. The 70th anniversary of the people\u2019s republic means China\u2019s single-party government has lasted a year longer than the Soviet Union \u2014 and it shows no sign of cracking yet.\n\nThe rise of \u201ca true opposition movement would take a systemic crisis \u2014 say, a real economic meltdown or a climate-induced catastrophe \u2014 that doesn\u2019t yet seem likely,\u201d Beijing-based journalist Ian Johnson noted. \u201cAnd so, superficially at least, the Communist Party seems to go from strength to strength, relying on China\u2019s capable civil service to make sure the high-speed trains run on time, the highways hum with new cars, and the aircraft carriers get built.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s a tension burrowed inside this seeming stability, Johnson concluded: \u201cIt is precisely this return to prosperity that has given people the opportunity to contemplate a century-old question: what exactly holds their country together other than brute force?\u201d\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday, along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions?
