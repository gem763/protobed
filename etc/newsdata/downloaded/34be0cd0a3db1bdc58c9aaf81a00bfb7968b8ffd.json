However, after two blowout quarters from earlier this year, \u201cthe shock factor is wearing off,\u201d according to MoffettNathanson.\n\nAmong the factors complicating the bull view was that Snap\u2019s revenue outlook was seen as light, though analysts noted its history of being conservative with forecasts. Many firms also expressed valuation concerns after a massive rally, leading to some trimmed price targets.\n\nShares fluctuated between positive and negative territory in morning trading, and last traded down 1.5% on the day. At current levels, the Snapchat parent is up nearly 180% from a December low, but down more than 20% from a July peak. Should the stock close at current levels, it would represent the quietest reaction to a quarterly report in Snap\u2019s history, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, based on the size of the one-day share reaction.\n\nHere\u2019s what analysts are saying about the results:\n\nJPMorgan, Doug Anmuth\n\nUpgrades to overweight from neutral; price target raised to $20 from $17.\n\n\u201cSnap\u2019s platform and business have both improved dramatically over the past several quarters,\u201d based on revenue growth and user trends, and this quarter \u201cshowed more encouraging trends.\u201d\n\nThe stock is \u201cat an inflection point\u201d with Ebitda, and shares look \u201cincreasingly compelling\u201d after recent weakness.\n\nNeedham, Laura Martin\n\nA growing number of \u201calways on\u201d advertisers \u201ccreates a more stable revenue trajectory\u201d and should improve Snap\u2019s pricing power. Sees improved user engagement, along with better free-cash-flow and balance-sheet strength.\n\nUpgrades to hold from underperform.\n\nMoffettNathanson, Michael Nathanson\n\nThe results were \u201cimpressive\u201d but \u201cthe shock factor is wearing off.\u201d The focus is turning from user growth to how Snap can monetize the user base. \u201cWe question whether a story focused primarily on improving monetization...is enough to warrant the premium valuations seen just a few months ago.\u201d\n\nNeutral rating, price target raised to $14.50 from $14.\n\nMorgan Stanley, Brian Nowak\n\nThe results \u201cunderscore the company\u2019s better execution\u201d this year.\n\nLooking into 2020, Snap needs to show \u201cmore consistent\u201d growth in daily active users and engagement, as well as improved ad tools. Recent successes reflect \u201ca period of low-hanging fruit\u201d in terms of its improvements, and \u201cwe look for more ad unit/targeting innovation to continue to move SNAP into the \u2018must buy and highly measurable\u2019 category.\u201d\n\nEqual-weight rating, $17 price target.\n\nNomura Instinet, Mark Kelley\n\nIn terms of adjusted Ebitda, the outlook \u201ccalls for break-even to a positive $20mn to exit the year, accomplishing the stretch goal to achieve break-even in 2019.\u201d\n\nRaises Ebitda expectations for 2019 and 2020, and lifts price target to $16 from $15.
