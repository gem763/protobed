Bolton didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nBolton also said more than once that Trump\u2019s failure to respond to the Iranian attack on an American drone earlier this summer set the stage for the Islamic Republic\u2019s aggression in recent months.\n\nAt one point, Bolton, a previous chairman of Gatestone, suggested that had the U.S. retaliated for the drone shootdown, Iran might not have damaged the Saudi oil fields.\n\nBolton called the alleged attack on Saudi Arabia, which U.S. and Saudi officials have blamed on Iran, \u201can act of war\u201d by anyone\u2019s definition.\n\nThe former national security adviser\u2019s comments come on the same day Trump named his successor, hostage negotiator Robert C. O\u2019Brien.\n\nSpeaking on an airport tarmac in Los Angeles, Trump introduced his new top foreign policy aide as \u201chighly respected\u201d and hailed their \u201cgood chemistry.\u201d The remarks indicated that in O\u2019Brien, Trump sees a more compatible adviser than Bolton, whose disagreements with the president and clashes with other senior officials often spilled into public view.\n\nAfter the attack in June, Trump was poised to launch a military response against the Iranians \u2014 strongly urged by Bolton \u2014 but pulled back after Fox News host Tucker Carlson and others warned him that it was a bad idea.\n\nDuring Wednesday\u2019s luncheon, Bolton said the planned response had gone through the full process and everybody in the White House had agreed on the retaliatory strike.\n\nBut \u201ca high authority, at the very last minute,\" without telling anyone, decided not to do it, Bolton complained.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Trump pushed back strongly.\n\n\u201cWell, I was critical of John Bolton for getting us involved with a lot of other people in the Middle East,\u201d he told reporters during a visit to the U.S.-Mexico border south of San Diego. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent $7.5 trillion in the Middle East and you ought to ask a lot of people about that.\u201c\n\n\u201cJohn was not able to work with anybody, and a lot of people disagreed with his ideas,\u201d Trump added. \u201cA lot of people were very critical that I brought him on in the first place because of the fact that he was so in favor of going into the Middle East, and he got stuck in quicksand and we became policemen for the Middle East. It\u2019s ridiculous.\u201c\n\nBolton spoke to around 60 Gatestone donors at the exclusive restaurant Le Bernardin in Manhattan. Attendees included noted lawyer Alan Dershowitz and his wife Carolyn, former attorney general Michael Mukasey, Newsmax CEO Chris Ruddy, First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams, former Fox Business Network host John Stossel, former New York Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey and New York billionaire John Catsimadis.\n\nBillionaire Rebekah Mercer introduced Bolton as \u201cthe best national security adviser our country could have hoped for,\u201d garnering her very loud applause. Bolton had been scheduled to speak to the group before Trump fired him.\n\nIn his talk and the Q&A session that followed, Bolton took attendees through a number of global issues.\n\nOn Afghanistan, another frequent subject of disagreement with the president, Bolton said that the U.S. should not have pursued a peace deal with the Taliban.\n\nInstead, he said, the U.S. should keep 8,600 troops in Afghanistan with intelligence support and other support elements. He called the proposed deal that was on the table similar to the agreement the Taliban offered the U.S. after 9/11, but said \u201cit doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d\n\nMore than once, Bolton said, Israel would \u201csooner or later\u201d see a new government, even though he personally liked Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nOn Venezuela, a focus of his short White House tenure, Bolton claimed there were 20,000 to 25,000 Cuban troops in the South American country. The day they left, he predicted, the Nicholas Maduro regime would fall by midnight.\n\nHe also said that if British Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn were to become prime minister, it would be \u201cfatal to the special relationship\u201d between the U.S. and Britain.\n\nDuring the Q&A session, Dershowitz told the crowd that it was \u201ca national disaster\u201d that Bolton had been booted from the White House, to what the attendee described as \u201cthunderous applause.\u201d\n\nCaitlin Oprysko contributed to this report.", "description": "The recently fired U.S. national security adviser made little secret of his disagreements with the president.", "authors": ["Daniel Lippman"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1139970897-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
