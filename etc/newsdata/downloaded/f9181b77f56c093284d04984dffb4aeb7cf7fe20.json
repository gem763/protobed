That is hardly surprising given a version of this was one of the ACCC\u2019s recommendations for increasing competition and supply in the market.\n\nHe says smaller players have had difficulty in gaining sufficient contracts to back their investment, contributing to the dearth of increasingly critical new firming power.\n\nAs for the major energy companies\u2019 complaints they need longer-term certainty from the government in order to persuade boards to invest in long-dated assets?\n\n\u201cFast-start gas generators are relatively cheap and quick to install and the cost of gas is negligible if the plant targets peak spot market electricity prices,\u201d Sims said pointedly. Yet AGL is so far the only big company to respond with investment, building just one new gas peaking plant in South Australia \u2013 and that is only replacing retiring capacity.\n\nIn the past few years, the big companies mostly left the physical investment in renewable generation to smaller players, instead supporting them with long-term purchasing agreements as this was cheaper. Whether this will work with firming generation is enough to give any regulator a headache.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Sims is clearly sceptical of trying to encourage such investment by paying generators to have such capacity available in case it is needed. Despite its superficial appeal, he says, the experience in other countries has led to over-procurement and unnecessary costs for consumers.\n\n\u201cIn the transition to more renewable energy, how do we avoid the mistakes of the past in allowing new generation to be built divorced from whether it is needed, and without consideration of the cost for consumers imposed by the needed transmission?\u201d he asked.\n\nThat includes someone who wants \u201cto put a wind farm in the back of Bourke\u201d. \u201cWho\u2019s paying for the transmission?\u201d he asked, arguing rigorous assessment was required.\n\nGetting the right answers to some of these questions of detail doesn\u2019t just niggle the regulators or the government, even if they largely bypass the public debate. They are critical to the inevitable transition of an energy sector still about 60 per cent dependent on coal-fired power, with 20 per cent coming from gas and 20 per cent from renewable energy, including hydro.\n\nCath Tanna, chief executive of EnergyAustralia, wryly told the Summit that the debate over energy seemed stuck with everyone yelling at one another \u2013 more like being in a bar at closing time. (Perhaps it depends on which bar she frequents.)\n\nBut in another example of hope over energy experience, she says tribalism and the pursuit of people to blame has to stop if there\u2019s to be any progress.\n\n\u201cWe already have most of the puzzle pieces for a modern, cleaner energy system: it looks like solar, wind, demand response, pumped hydro, battery storage and intelligent energy management, supported by gas-fired generation,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know we need an energy market that rewards flexible and dispatchable energy ... a market that encourages investment before there\u2019s a generation shortfall, and one that places risk with the private sector, and not households or taxpayers.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell that\u2019s the theory, of course. The challenge, as she points out, is to put all the pieces together in a way that is simple, affordable and fair to customers.\n\nAnd that includes getting better at managing the retirement of ageing big coal-fired power stations, avoiding the price spikes and power shortages that accompanied the shutdown of Hazelwood in Victoria in 2016.\n\n\u201cThere might be a dozen [closures] in the next 30 years,\" she said. \u201cIf replacement capacity isn\u2019t ready to go, and we haven\u2019t planned to manage impacts on communities, we will repeat Hazelwood.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s one reason energy minister Angus Taylor is determined to ensure there is \u201clike for like\u201d replacement of dispatchable power after the closure of the Liddell coal-fired power station in NSW or an extension of its life beyond AGL\u2019s planned exit date of 2023.\n\nOr will it still be more like closing time at Cath Tanna's bar?", "description": "Rod Sims isn't buying the complaints of the big power companies about the reasons they are not investing in firming power like gas and pumped hydro.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2853%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_458/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/164bf5f9abb221ab767baeb81cfb9d88e5dd5595", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
