They are not allowed to formally coordinate directly with any candidate or party.\n\nBiden, a centrist who has seen his poll numbers slide and has lagged in fundraising compared to his competitors, was quickly met with criticism from progressives.\n\n\u201cThe former Vice President has been unable to generate grassroots support, and now his campaign is endorsing an effort to buy the primary through a super PAC that can rake in unlimited cash from billionaires and corporations. That\u2019s not how we defeat Trump. It\u2019s a recipe to maintain a corrupt political system which enriches wealthy donors and leaves the working class behind,\u201d Sanders said in a statement.\n\nIn her statement, Bedingfield did not definitively say Biden would work with a super PAC and maintained that he would push for an end to Citizens United, the Supreme Court decision that first allowed the unlimited political expenditures.\n\nHowever, she hinted that Democrats needed to match Republican fundraising as President Trump and the Republican National Committee amass a gargantuan war chest. The two have combined to raise more than $100 million in each of the previous two quarters, dwarfing the amount raised by Democratic contenders.\n\n\u201cUntil we have these badly needed reforms, we will see more than a billion dollars in spending by Trump and his allies to reelect this corrupt president,\u201d Bedingfield told NBC News. \u201cHe and his allies are already spending [a] massive amount of money on paid television and digital advertising to intervene directly in Democratic primaries with the goal of preventing Joe Biden, the opponent that Trump fears most, from becoming the Democratic nominee.\u201d\n\nThe statement comes as Biden faces questions about the strength of his campaign. He struggled to raise as much money as his 2020 Democratic rivals in the third quarter of 2019 and spent more than he raised in those three months.\n\nFilings with the Federal Election Commission showed that the former vice president finished the third quarter with just under $9 million cash on hand, while Sens.
