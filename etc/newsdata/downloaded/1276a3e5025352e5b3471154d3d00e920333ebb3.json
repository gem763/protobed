AES (AES) Could Be a Great Choice", "language": "en", "text": "All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio, whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities. But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.\n\nCash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.\n\nAES in Focus\n\nHeadquartered in Arlington, AES (AES) is a Utilities stock that has seen a price change of 16.18% so far this year. The power company is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.14 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.25%. This compares to the Utility - Electric Power industry's yield of 2.86% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.87%.\n\nIn terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $0.55 is up 5.8% from last year. In the past five-year period, AES has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 12.35%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, AES's payout ratio is 44%, which means it paid out 44% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.\n\nAES is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is $1.34 per share, with earnings expected to increase 8.06% from the year ago period.\n\nBottom Line\n\nFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.\n\nFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, AES is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).\n\n\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
