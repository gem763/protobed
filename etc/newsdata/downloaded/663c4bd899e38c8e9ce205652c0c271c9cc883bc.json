Yet many financial plans nevertheless assume that you will. The famous 4% rule, for example, grew out of research about what steady withdrawal rate you could maintain throughout retirement and never run out of money\u2014even if the markets perform as terribly as they have in the worst periods in U.S. history.\n\nBy definition, of course, avoiding the worst-case scenario ends up, in most cases, leaving a lot of money on the table. New research shows that there is a better way.\n\nThis new research, which began circulating in academic circles earlier this month, was conducted by Javier Estrada, a professor of finance at IESE Business School in Barcelona. His new study is entitled: \u201cManaging to Target (II): Dynamic Adjustments for Retirement Strategies.\u201d\n\nIn it, Estrada measured the success rates of various strategies that adjusted withdrawal rates depending on whether your portfolio in any given year is ahead or behind of what your retirement financial plan had assumed it should be. It will be ahead, needless to say, if your investments perform better than had been assumed by your financial plan\u2014and behind if your investments have performed more poorly.\n\nEstrada refers to strategies that adjusted withdrawal rates as \u201cdynamic,\u201d in contrast to the \u201cstatic\u201d strategy implicitly assumed by many financial planners.\n\nTo illustrate: Let\u2019s say you retire with a $1 million portfolio, want to fund a 30-year retirement, and your investments grow at an annualized rate of 5% above inflation. Assuming you do not intend to leave a bequest, and assuming your portfolio\u2019s investment return is 5% in each year along the way, you can withdraw the equivalent of $61,954 in today\u2019s dollars in each and every one of those 30 years.\n\nIn fact, of course, that italicized assumption is unrealistic. Given the inevitable variability of yearly returns along the way\u2014some good and some bad, it\u2019s not unlikely that, at some point along the way, your portfolio\u2019s performance would be insufficient to support that rate of steady withdrawals. You\u2019d run out of money, in other words.\n\nEstrada wanted to know if it would be a better idea, at the first sign of trouble, to temporarily reduce your withdrawals\u2014rather than wait until your portfolio is completely depleted. He found that doing that significantly increased the likelihood of achieving your retirement financing goals. And increasing your chances of success didn\u2019t require overwhelmingly large adjustments. Even reducing your withdrawals by 10% or 20% had a significant impact\u2014meaning, in the above example, that your annual withdrawal would be no lower than $55,759 or $49,563 (for a 10% or 20% temporary reduction, respectively).\n\nYou might find such a reduction intolerable, of course. But bear in mind several things. First, the required reduction wouldn\u2019t come as an immediate surprise, since it would be obvious nearing the end of a particular year that your portfolio was falling short\u2014giving you time to plan for the reduction. Secondly, there aren\u2019t any great alternatives when your retirement portfolio falls short. Not reducing your withdrawals only postpones your pain, since eventually you will have to reduce your spending.\n\nThirdly, the dynamic strategies Estrada explored also allow for increased withdrawals following years in which your retirement portfolio is ahead of its targeted value. There is no requirement that you spend that extra amount, of course, and you could put it in a rainy-day fund to support you in those years in which withdrawals are lower.\n\nEstrada also explored another type of dynamic retirement financing strategy, which involved adjusting your equity allocation according to whether your retirement portfolio is ahead or behind its targeted value. Though he found that these strategies also helped, they were not nearly as helpful as those dynamic strategies that adjusted withdrawal rates.\n\nEstrada\u2019s new study complements an earlier one that focused on strategies during the preretirement phase of your life when you\u2019re saving and investing. You may recall that I devoted another column to that earlier study, which also found that dynamic strategies are superior to static ones: A willingness to adjust the amount you save and invest, depending on the performance of your portfolio, increases the chances you will achieve whatever goal you have set for how big you portfolio should be when you retire.\n\nThis new study extends that conclusion, allowing us to conclude generally that being dynamic\u2014a willingness to adjust investment or withdrawal amounts\u2014increases your chances of reaching your goals.\n\nThe even broader implication is that the world is profoundly uncertain, and no amount of good planning can possibly deal with ever eventuality. So it behooves all of us to plan for flexibility.\n\nMark Hulbert is a regular contributor to MarketWatch. His Hulbert Ratings tracks investment newsletters that pay a flat fee to be audited.
