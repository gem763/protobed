Saudi military orchestra welcomes Putin with Russia\u2019s anthem... or at least it tries to (VIDEOS)", "language": "en", "text": "President Vladimir Putin has been greeted in Saudi Arabia by a dodgy rendition of the Russian national anthem. The performance was far from stellar \u2013 but still merely mediocre, compared to some of the worst-ever anthem fails.\n\nThe unexpected ear-shattering performance of the country\u2019s anthem awaited Russia\u2019s president at the Saudi royal palace as he met King Salman on Monday. An entire military orchestra, accompanied by a sizeable honor guard detachment, performed for the two leaders right inside the palace \u2013 and their rendition of the Russian anthem turned out to be a bit off \u2013 to put it mildly.\n\nTo be fair, the anthem was somewhat recognizable \u2013 in the beginning, at least. It seems the Saudi royal orchestra has learned something from the utterly shameful version of the US national anthem it performed back in 2017 to greet US President Donald Trump.\n\nThat performance of the US anthem was arguably on a par with the notoriously disastrous renditions of national anthems repeatedly produced by an Egyptian military orchestra. Back in 2015, they slaughtered the Russian anthem, \u2018spicing up\u2019 Putin\u2019s visit.\n\nAnd, in 2016, they ripped apart the Marseillaise, subjecting then-president of France Francois Hollande to a round of aural torture.\n\nEgyptian orchestra FAILS on French anthem,\n\n\n\nit\u2019s literally a disaster#Egypt#Francehttps://t.co/ddBgSCwNQN \u2014 In the NOW (@IntheNow_tweet) April 19, 2016\n\nto RT newsletter to get stories the mainstream media won\u2019t tell you.", "description": "President Vladimir Putin has been greeted in Saudi Arabia by a dodgy rendition of the Russian national anthem.
