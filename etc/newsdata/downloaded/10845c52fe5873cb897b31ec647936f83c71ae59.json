The layoffs have added to fears that a weakened manufacturing sector could tip the economy into recession \u2014 potentially playing a role in next year\u2019s election especially in a swing state like Michigan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a necessary strike but everyone is feeling the hurt,\u201d said Mike Luna, a warehouse worker and a chairman of United Auto Workers Local 652, which is made up of striking GM workers and many laid off supplier employees.\n\nLuna works at a Ryder Integrated Logistics warehouse, where about 500 workers have been laid off, leaving the semi-trailers in the parking lot. They are chock full of auto parts destined for one of two nearby GM plants: Hoods and painted body panels for Chevrolet Camaros; and hinges, hubcaps and exhaust systems for Cadillac sedans, Buick SUVs and Chevys.\n\nThe automaker itself has already lost more than US$1 billion in earnings before interest and taxes, according to one analyst estimate. GM\u2019s bigger parts suppliers are losing as much as US$2 million a day by the same measurement. Workers at smaller parts makers across the U.S. are sending employees home.\n\nIt's a necessary strike but everyone is feeling the hurt Mike Luna, a warehouse worker and a chairman of United Auto Workers Local 652\n\nIn Michigan, parts workers furloughed by the walkout do not get strike pay and just this week began receiving state unemployment benefits that max out at US$342 a week \u2014 not enough for most of his co-workers to live on, Luna said. Striking workers at GM get even less from a UAW rainy day fund, just US$250 a week.\n\nIn a letter to members dated Friday, Terry Dittes, the union\u2019s vice president in charge of talks with GM, said \u201cgood progress\u201d has been made negotiating issues such as health care and the treatment of temporary workers.\n\nThe parties have moved closer to a deal but two sticking points remain. They are employee pension plans and shortening the length of time required for entry-level workers to earn top hourly pay of US$28, according to people familiar with the matter on Saturday.\n\nRecession Concern\n\nThe strike comes at a potential inflection point for America\u2019s economy. New statistics last week showed a sharp drop in U.S. manufacturing in September.\n\nThe GM strike isn\u2019t helping. It\u2019s chopped US$400 million in direct wages out of the U.S. economy, with half of that loss coming in Michigan, Patrick Anderson, chief executive officer of Anderson Economic Group in Lansing, estimated. The U.S. Treasury has lost US$154 million so far just in payroll and income taxes.\n\nIn the southeast Michigan economy, a factory-heavy region, the layoffs have shaved off 1.8 per cent of earned income, he said. If that trend lasts for a quarter, \u201cthe chances of southeast Michigan going into a recession are pretty high,\u201d Anderson said in an interview.\n\nThe impact stretches beyond Michigan. Canadian components maker Linamar Corp., which makes metal parts for drivetrains like camshafts and transmission cases, said Wednesday the sudden drop in GM orders is costing it up to one million Canadian dollars (US$750,000) a day in lost revenue. Shares of the supplier slid as much as 13.8 per cent Thursday to a six-year low.\n\nThe walkout has forced American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings Inc. to lay off workers at its largest driveline plant in the U.S. The company, which was spun off from GM in 1994, still relies on the automaker for 39 per cent of its revenue. CEO David Dauch told Bloomberg last week his company may adjust its full-year earnings outlook if the strike continues for \u201can extended period of time.\u201d Its stock has fallen 18 per cent since the labour action began on Sept. 16.\n\nLost Profit\n\nThe strike is costing Axle and Lear Corp., another big supplier, US$2 million a day each while the toll on parts-maker Tenneco Inc. is US$1 million daily, said RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak.\n\nGM and its suppliers can make up some production once the strike ends, but not all of it. So some profit will either be lost or shifted to next year.\n\n\u201cWe are getting to the point where it will be difficult to recover the lost production this year,\u201d Spak wrote in a research note. \u201cIn some respects, that makes the remainder of 2019 somewhat of a throwaway for the group and could shift the focus to 2020.\u201d\n\nFrom the union\u2019s perspective, GM turned out record profits over the life of the expired four-year deal and CEO Mary Barra made more than US$66 million. It wants a pay raise, especially for newer employees who start at less than US$20 an hour, and a clear path for temporary workers to become full-timers making US$30 an hour.\n\nGM is looking to hold costs down, arguing that its current total compensation package of US$63 an hour is already more than that offered by Ford Motor Co., Fiat Chrysler and the Japanese plants in the U.S.\n\nWhile the two sides wrestle over those and a few other issues, furloughed parts workers struggle to make do. At Ryder and most of the smaller suppliers, workers make around US$15 an hour. Union leader Luna said he cautioned workers a year ago to save for the strike. But at that wage, which equates to US$31,000 a year without overtime, many workers live check to check.\n\nSome employees have gone to the United Way and other charities for help with buying food and other essentials, he said. A few have applied for new jobs, but that\u2019s a tough sell.\n\n\u201cThey are trying to get work,\u201d Luna said, \u201cbut then you have to tell an employer that when the strike ends, you would go back.\u201d\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "The strike has chopped US$400 million in direct wages out of the U.S. economy, with half of that loss coming in Michigan", "authors": ["David Welch", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/strike-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
