Johnson was evasive in his response and began referring to Lisa Page and Peter Strzok, who were discovered to have exchanged personal text messages criticizing Trump during former special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into 2016 Russian election interference.\n\nThat set Todd off, who didn't understand how it was relevant to Trump's communications with Ukraine, which launched an impeachment inquiry. The two eventually calmed down, and Johnson did explain why he winced, while also pointing out that he was assured by Trump himself that he did not withhold aid from Kyiv.", "description": "Chuck Todd has no time for conspiracy theories.The host of NBC's Meet the Press clashed with Sen.
