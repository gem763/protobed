When things come up, there\u2019s multiple things that we haven\u2019t talked about that have happened in our own country that we don\u2019t bring up.\u201d\u2026\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to make sure the inner-city kids that grow up in my hometown can have a brighter future and look at me as an inspiration to get out of the hellhole of the inner city,\u201d James said. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about those stories enough. We want to talk about so many other things as well. There\u2019s issues all over the world. So I think the best thing we can do is if you feel passionate about it, talk about it. If you don\u2019t have a lot of knowledge about it or quite understand it, I don\u2019t think you should talk about it because it puts you in a tough position.\u201d\u2026\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t talk about it again. I\u2019d be cheating my teammates by continuing to harp on something that won\u2019t benefit us,\u201d James said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to win a championship. That\u2019s what we\u2019re here for. We\u2019re not politicians. It\u2019s a huge political thing. But we are leaders and we can step up at times. I\u2019m not saying at this particular time but if you don\u2019t feel like you should speak on things, you shouldn\u2019t have to.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Usa Today", "Usatoday.Com Story Sports Nba Lebron-James-China-Hong-Kong-Criticism"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
