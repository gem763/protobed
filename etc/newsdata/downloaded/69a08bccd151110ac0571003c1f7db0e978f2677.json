How it worked was a reporter would present a Republican politician with a quote that allegedly came from President Trump. The GOP politician would be asked if they agree with it. It was the old game of \u201chave you stopped beating your wife\u201d because the target had no way of knowing if the quote was accurate and, unfortunately, many people assumed they were dealing with an honorable individual. (ProTip: never assume the average political reporter has any more substantive sense of honor and decency than your typical debauched Arabian whoremonger.) But so many people fall for it that they don\u2019t know how to handle it when they meet up with someone who is wise to the game.\n\nThis latter event was the case when a Huffington Post reporter named Arthur Delaney tried to use deception to get a quote he could use either to ride the \u201cRepublicans are fleeing from Trump\u201d narrative or to file in the \u201cRepublicans will do anything to cover for Trump\u201d narrative. Unfortunately for him, his target was Missouri Senator Josh Hawley.\n\nThis is how Delaney describes it:\n\nBrought Senator Hawley a printout of this Trump quote, but he wouldn\u2019t look at it and said I made up a fake quote, and then he bragged that he owned me on Twitter pic.twitter.com/z8DiFeYZnj \u2014 Arthur Delaney (@ArthurDelaneyHP) September 24, 2019\n\nI think his issue is that I described the president asking Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden as the president asking a foreign government to help him win an election, as tho those are different things \u2014 Arthur Delaney (@ArthurDelaneyHP) September 24, 2019\n\nThe problem with Delaney\u2019s statement is that is composed of a couple of lies. The main one is that at no point in the White House statement does Trump imply that he wants Joe Biden investigated. Delaney simply makes that up out of whole cloth and because we have to assume he\u2019s not so stupid that he can\u2019t read, our only explanation left is that he\u2019s lying. The other issue, of course, is that Senator Hawley\u2019s timeline doesn\u2019t show him even acknowledging Delaney\u2019s presence on Twitter before what happened next. That is either a lie or the garden variety megalomania you find in failed reporters.\n\nWhy don\u2019t you try a little of this thing called journalism \u2013 where you report actual facts, not fake quotes from the President you\u2019ve made up to drive a partisan agenda. And then get back to me https://t.co/cHJj0icN4B \u2014 Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) September 23, 2019\n\nJust admit you want to see the President impeached \u2013 and you\u2019re willing to distort & mislead to get it done https://t.co/6FvcubC6up \u2014 Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) September 24, 2019\n\nAnd then Hawley unloaded on Delaney by revealing what was really said.\n\nAs impeachment circus begins, here\u2019s a case study in how leftist \u201creporters\u201d twist words and distort facts to advance their agenda. My exchanges over two days with HuffPo\u2019s Arthur Delaney \u2026 pic.twitter.com/bSpK7zWSJ5 \u2014 Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) September 25, 2019\n\nThis is the transcript for your convenience:\n\nThis is actually stunning behavior by Delaney. He not only lied to Hawley to elicit a response, he then compounded the lie on Twitter to get the story Hawley refused to give him.", "description": "Dishonest Huffington Post Reporter Gets Smoked By Senator Josh Hawley", "authors": ["Brandon Morse", "Alex Parker", "Sister Toldjah", "Elizabeth Vaughn", "Posted At Pm On September"], "top_image": "https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/AP_18205625103660.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
