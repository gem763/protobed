And you would have a Kessler-type of syndrome.\"\n\nIt will take thousands of years for any SpaceX satellites left in our orbit to descend to Earth and burn up in the atmosphere.\n\nThe firm says it's already taken steps to avoid cluttering up the region. It's launching the satellites into a lower orbital plane than most space tech to avoid collisions.\n\nEven with such precautions, mega-constellations like Starlink will results in 67,000 potential collisions per year, another space scientist warned.\n\nMusk isn't the only tech billionaire looking to colonize space with satellites.\n\nAmazon boss Jeff Bezos also has similar ideas.\n\nMusk has previously said he plans to send up nearly 12,000 satellites by the mid-2020s.\n\nIf everything goes to plan for SpaceX then internet users across the world could have 40 times faster internet speeds no matter where they live.\n\nHow much this service will cost has not yet been revealed but Musk intends to keep prices low.\n\nThis story originally appeared in The Sun.", "description": "SpaceX wants to add 30,000 Starlink broadband satellites to the 12,000 it already plans to put into orbit, despite concerns being raised about 'space junk' trapping us on Earth.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/musk.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
