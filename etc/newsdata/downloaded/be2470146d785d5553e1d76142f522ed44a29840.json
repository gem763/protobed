The crisis meeting will come the day after Johnson returns from a summit of European Union leaders in Brussels, giving U.K. politicians the chance to debate the way forward.\n\nWith just 12 days left before the country is due to leave the EU, and a deal looking unlikely, that rare Saturday session in the House of Commons is set to be fraught as MPs weigh their options: delaying Brexit, crashing out with no deal, or trying to bring down the government.\n\nIn Brussels, the talks are stuck and have descended into a blame game between Johnson\u2019s administration and EU leaders. Neither side has yet formally pulled out.\n\nKey Developments:\n\nParliament to sit on Saturday Oct. 19 after crunch EU summit. Parliament has only sat four times on a Saturday since 1939.Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay to hold talks with EU Chief Negotiator Michel Barnier on ThursdayBarnier: a deal is \u201cvery difficult, but possible\u201dJohnson\u2019s DUP allies reject mooted European compromise plan for Irish borderCourt in Edinburgh postpones ruling on forcing Johnson to request Brexit delayBrexit Talks Go On Hold as Leaders Focus on Pinning Blame\n\nMerkel Not Breaking Code of Silence (1:30 p.m.)\n\nMerkel chief spokesman Steffen Seibert kept getting pressed about the now-famous morning phone call. The U.K. side have given their take on it but Germans are not, but one can try and read between the lines.\n\nHere is what he said to reporters in Berlin:\n\n\u201cWe have no new position on Brexit, neither the chancellor nor the government. This is what we\u2019ve always said. The government will work to find a solution until the last possible moment, so that we can have an orderly U.K. exit out of the EU and avoid the scenario of a no-deal or disorderly exit, because that is the worst-case scenario for all involved.\u201d\n\nAsked more pointedly whether the chancellor said what the British press (or Downing Street) said she said: \u201cA private conversation is a private conversation.\u201d He went on to say, again, that Germany\u2019s position hasn\u2019t changed.\n\nBarnier: Deal Is \u2018Difficult But Possible\u2019 (12:15 p.m.)\n\nMichel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, said a deal with the U.K. is \u201cvery difficult but possible\u201d as he prepared to meet with Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe EU will remain calm, vigilant, respectful and constructive. The technical talks continue and I\u2019m invited for working lunch with Steve Barclay tomorrow,\u201d Barnier told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cI think a deal is possible, very difficult but possible.\u201d\n\nIrish Backstop Can\u2019t Have time limit, EU Says (12 p.m.)\n\nEU Budget Commissioner Guenther Oettinger said he and his European Commission colleagues had discussed Brexit and all agreed the latest British proposal was inadequate. The Irish backstop can\u2019t have a time limit, Oettinger told reporters in Brussels.\n\nBoris Johnson Has a Plan B for Brexit If the EU Rejects His Deal\n\nReported EU Plan Non-Runner, DUP Says (11:35 a.m.)\n\nThe DUP moved quickly to kill off a reported move by the EU to break the deadlock by giving the Northern Ireland Assembly a say over how long EU customs rules last (see 11:20 a.m.). Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson said this would allow Sinn Fein keep the region bound to the EU indefinitely.\n\n\u201cThis is worse than Mrs May\u2019s deal, which at least contained the pretense of these arrangements only being used as an insurance policy,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThis proposal confirms the intended permanency of keeping Northern Ireland in the EU and removing us from the United Kingdom.\u201d\n\nScottish Court Delays Decision on Extension (11:25 a.m.)\n\nScottish judges held off intervening in the Brexit furor by postponing a decision on whether they need to commit to sending a letter requesting an extension, giving Boris Johnson a temporary legal victory.\n\nThe judges ruled that Johnson hadn\u2019t acted unlawfully but left the door open to a new case if he fails to reach a deal with the EU and refuses to request an extension by Oct. 19, as he would be required to by law. Under a power peculiar to Scottish law, known as nobile officium, Scottish courts can intervene in any way they see fit to fix an outcome.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Follow\u00a0@Brexit,\u00a0sign up\u00a0to our Brexit Bulletin, and\u00a0tell us your Brexit story.\u00a0As hopes of a breakthrough in Brexit negotiations fade, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson scheduled an emergency sitting of the British Parliament for Saturday Oct. 19.
