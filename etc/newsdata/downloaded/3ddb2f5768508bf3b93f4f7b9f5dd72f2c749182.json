I\u2019m so lucky that I survived, and went on to use EMDR to treat my severe PTSD. I urge you to hang on just a bit longer and ask for help if you need it. Because things can turn around. I promise. \u2014 Jameela Jamil \ud83c\udf08 (@jameelajamil) October 10, 2019\n\nShe said she sought help through eye movement desensitization and reprocessing, or EMDR, a form of \u201cpsychotherapy that enables people to heal from the symptoms and emotional distress that are the result of disturbing life experiences,\u201d according to the EMDR Institute.\n\nThere is so much work to do in Improving awareness and mental health care, and we need to further de-stigmatize the conversation around asking for help. While you\u2019re gathering the strength, I recommend the work of @matthaig1 @Ayishat_Akanbi and @scarcurtis \u2764\ufe0fALL my love to you\u2764\ufe0f \u2014 Jameela Jamil \ud83c\udf08 (@jameelajamil) October 10, 2019\n\nLater, on Instagram, she elaborated, acknowledging that \u201cnot everyone is lucky enough to be able to access affordable therapy.\u201d\n\nLinking to two crisis hotlines, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s not something you have to tolerate on your own. You have nothing to hide or be ashamed of. I feel you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been there,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a process of radical self forgiveness, patience and care that will help you out. It feels like the pain, nightmares and exhaustion will never end sometimes, but they can. And they will.\u201d\n\nJamil, who appears in the forthcoming film \u201cHow to Build a Girl\u201d with Beanie Feldstein and Emma Thompson, has been outspoken about the benefits she found in EMDR.\n\n\u201cI had a therapy called EMDR that I used for depression, anxiety, eating disorder issues and PTSD, and if you should be lucky enough to access any mental healthcare I would urge you to spend your money on that before ANYTHING else that isn\u2019t a necessity for your life,\u201d she wrote on Instagram in July. \u201cSaved my life.\u201d\n\nAnd the star, who also founded the \u201cI Weigh\u201d movement, told People in August she still suffers from body dysmorphia but has stopped looking in the mirror.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not interested in my appearance,\u201d she said. \u201cDoing that has helped me concentrate on progressing and doing things that enrich my life, like watching my career grow and my relationships grow. That\u2019s what gives me a wonderful sense of self.\u201d\n\nIf you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.
