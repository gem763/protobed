Tropical storm Forecasted path Hurricane winds Reported Tropical-storm winds Reported Likely Note: Areas shown as likely to receive tropical-storm-force winds have a 50 percent or higher chance of experiencing wind speeds of at least 39 miles per hour.\n\nOn Sunday, Hurricane Dorian reached the Bahamas as a Category 5 storm with winds of 185 m.p.h. and gusts over 220 m.p.h. Its path is now expected to turn north before reaching Florida, which would spare the state of a direct hit. The storm is forecast to make its way north toward Georgia and the Carolinas.\n\nFor the latest updates on the storm, follow our live coverage.\n\nPredicting Dorian\u2019s path has been particularly challenging for meteorologists. The National Hurricane Center uses various models that show where the storm could go using different forecasting techniques.\n\nThe map below shows the official forecast of National Hurricane Center compared to simulations from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, which are generated by running their forecast model many times using a range of initial conditions.\n\nPotential storm paths as of Official forecast Model simulations Replay\n\nForecasters predict Hurricane Dorian will travel northward along the coast of Florida. According to the current path prediction, the storm may not make landfall at all this week, but coastal areas alongside it could still receive potentially devastating rains and storm surge.\n\nExpected rainfall for the next seven days\n\nOn Friday, President Trump approved an emergency declaration for Florida, giving the state increased federal support and resources. On Saturday, with the predicted path of the storm now changed, the governor of South Carolina declared a state of emergency as well, followed by similar declarations for North Carolina and parts of Georgia. With the lack of clarity on where the storm will hit, Florida residents wrestled with the question of whether to stay or evacuate.\n\nThe view from space Satellite image taken at 5:40 p.m. Sunday Satellite image by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\n\nFor latest updates on Hurricane Dorian, follow our live coverage.", "description": "Maps tracking the hurricane\u2019s path as it makes its way toward Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas.", "authors": ["Matthew Bloch", "Denise Lu"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/27/us/hurricane-dorian-map-promo-1566933204147/hurricane-dorian-map-promo-1566933204147-facebookJumbo-v261.png"}
