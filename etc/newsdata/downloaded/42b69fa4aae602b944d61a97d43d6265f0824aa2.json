That outing on Oct. 11 \u2014 with five strikeouts and just one walk against a Cardinals team that was fresh off a 13-1 win over Atlanta at the time \u2014 got Washington rolling to an eventual sweep.\n\nIt was a masterful performance, one of the highlights of S\u00e1nchez\u2019s career. Now the question won\u2019t be necessarily whether S\u00e1nchez can replicate it, but how he\u2019ll fare after two full weeks without game action when he starts Game 3 of the World Series Friday night against the Houston Astros.\n\nThe 35-year-old Venezuelan says he\u2019s anxious to get on the field, but not worried about the gap between starts. After all, he already dealt with a similarly long layoff not long ago \u2014 11 days passed between S\u00e1nchez\u2019s last start of the regular season, Sept. 25, and his first playoff start, Oct. 6.\n\n\u201cI think most of the time, like right now, probably you need to rest because I\u2019ve been throwing a baseball since February, probably January,\u201d he said. \u201cSo right now it\u2019s not something that\u2019s going to affect you. So for me, I\u2019m fine with the rest.\u201d\n\nIn his first season with Washington, S\u00e1nchez got off to a terrible start, failing to win a start until May 29 after a brief stint on the injured list. But as manager Dave Martinez said Thursday, he\u2019s been \u201cunbelievable\u201d since returning from the IL, going 11-2 the rest of the year.\n\nThe Nationals\u2019 pitching situation could look a lot worse if not for S\u00e1nchez becoming their reliable No. 4 starter.\n\nWhen the playoffs arrived, while other teams in the running had to play the occasional \u201cbullpen game\u201d after exhausting their top two or three starters, S\u00e1nchez has helped the Nationals avoid that potential pitfall. Given how the bullpen posted a collective 5.68 ERA in the regular season, Washington is clearly stronger with their big four starters going six or seven innings into a postseason start \u2014 and using an occasional inning of relief from usual starting arm Patrick Corbin along the way.\n\nCorbin was originally projected to start Game 3, but he was pushed back a day after throwing 21 pitches out of the bullpen in Game 1 of the Series. Martinez confirmed Thursday that Corbin will start Game 4.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a hard decision for me to say (S\u00e1nchez is) going to be Game 3 starter,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cHe\u2019s got great command of all his pitches, which is a lot. Hopefully he goes out there and keeps us in the ball game and we have a chance to win again.\u201d\n\nAfter a difficult ending to his time with the Detroit Tigers in 2016 and 2017, S\u00e1nchez was worried about it possibly signaling the end of his major league career. He bounced back with the Braves in 2018 and earned himself a two-year deal with the Nationals.\n\nNow, he says, he feels blessed that he\u2019s about to pitch in a World Series game for the second time, after his 2012 appearance with Detroit.\n\n\u201cThank God that I got this opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout him I don\u2019t think that I was here.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
