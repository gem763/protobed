It denies responsibility for the attack on Saudi Arabia as well as attacks on oil tankers earlier this year.", "description": "The United States announced on Friday a new, large deployment of forces to Saudi Arabia to help bolster the kingdom's defences following the Sept. 14 attack on its oil facilities, which Washington and Riyadh have blamed on Iran.", "authors": ["Phil Stewart", "Idrees Ali", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439761469&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A1L2", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
