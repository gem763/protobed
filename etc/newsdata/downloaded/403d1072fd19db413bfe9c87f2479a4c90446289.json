I knew I had the talents, I just didn\u2019t know how to make anything of them.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nTaking on the role of a bereaved mum in the gritty four-parter has been a cathartic experience, Joanna reveals.\n\nIn an exclusive Sunday People interview, she said: \u201cActing is a place where I can express myself and find emotions I didn\u2019t even know I had. That is good in terms of my \u00admental health.\n\n\u201cIf things are too painful to look at head on, this sideways approach really is very\n\neffective for me. I haven\u2019t felt any depression for well over ten years.\u201d\n\nIn The Accident, Joanna plays mum Angela Griffiths, whose daughter is one of a group of teenagers killed in an explosion at a local regeneration project in a small Welsh town.\n\nActing is so helpful for wellbeing she has even started to teach drama techniques to teenagers living with cancer.\n\nShe hopes \u00adexpressing emotions through acting can help others manage their mental health.\n\nJoanna says she loved working with co-star Lancashire, 55, who has become a good friend.\n\n(Image: Warren Orchard.

We\u2019d really like to work together again. It would be great.\n\n\u201cWe were always trying to make each other get deeper and deeper into the \u00adcharacterisation.\n\n\u201cI trusted her completely as an actress and as a person.\n\n\u201cWe did little evening debriefs in the hotel in Swansea. We had a lot of bruschettas.\u201d\n\nThe series also stars Mark Lewis Jones as Sarah\u2019s on-screen husband Iwan Bevan, Adrian Scarborough as lawyer Philip Walters and Sidse Babett Knudsen as property developer Harriet Paulsen.\n\n(Image: Channel 4/The Forge/Warren Orcha)\n\nJoanna confided: \u201cApologies to Sidse, I just couldn\u2019t really talk to her.\n\n\u201cI saw her as the enemy and got locked into that thinking.\n\n\u201cI could not take on the \u00adcorporate side without just wanting to spit at the ground in front of them. It was really strange.\u201d\n\nThe loss of her daughter is a huge tragedy for \u00adsupermarket worker Angela, but Joanna \u00adreveals how she finds her \u00adpurpose in the aftermath and passionately sets about campaigning for justice.\n\nWhile she didn\u2019t consciously base Angela on anyone, Joanna admits that after they \u00adfinished \u00adfilming she realised there were \u00adcomparisons between her \u00adcharacter and real-life campaigners such as Doreen Lawrence and Ann Ming.\n\n(Image: Simon Ridgway)\n\nBaroness Lawrence battled for justice after her son Stephen\u2019s racially \u00admotivated murder.\n\nAnd Ann fought to get the double jeopardy law \u00adreformed so that convict Billy Dunlop, who admitted murdering her daughter Julie Hogg, could be put on trial again even though he was earlier found not guilty.\n\nShe said: \u201cAngela loses her child and is \u00adutterly devastated but the process she goes through empowers her.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not in the script but I see her going on to become a proper campaigner.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t base her on anybody but I was watching one of those crime and justice \u00addocumentaries about Ann Ming and I was thinking, \u2018Oh that is really similar'.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe now, but Joanna gave up on acting \u00adaltogether for a while after \u00adsuffering \u00admultiple rejections for roles in her 20s.\n\nThankfully she gave it another crack and, aged 34, finally landed a part in Peak Practice.\n\nBut her best work so far has come in her 40s and 50s, finding fame as Terri Coverley in politics satire The Thick Of It and Det Insp Vivienne Deering in police drama No Offence.\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\nShe said: \u201cI\u2019ve been lucky. As I\u2019ve grown in my career, the industry has been changing \u00adsimultaneously. What is happening now is women are writing those stories more. Women are creating those stories.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m lucky to be riding the crest of a very brilliant wave of female characterisations.\u201d\n\nJoanna is also proud to represent bigger women on screen.\n\nShe said: \u201cYes, that is the real world isn\u2019t it? We\u2019re supposedly in this obesity crisis, well that\u2019s a casting opportunity for me.\n\n(Image: BBC/Origin Pictures)\n\n\u201cI do believe in living well and healthily but I also believe this is the real world and these \u00adissues of sexuality and body positivity are very \u00adcurrent and I\u2019m right in the \u00adepicentre of that. I\u2019m really glad to be me.\u201d\n\nJoanna previously revealed she piled on weight at Cambridge University in the 1980s to avoid the \u201csexually aggressive\u201d atmosphere, saying \u201cmy extra padding prevented me from being \u00ad\u00adan \u00adobvious target\u201d.\n\nAlmost 40 years later, Joanna fears male \u00adattitudes haven\u2019t changed much.\n\n(Image: Empics Entertainment)\n\nShe said: \u201cI think that\u2019s still an issue. There is a sense in which there\u2019s almost a backlash around basic respect which can be very tough.\n\n\u201cWhen I talk to my young god-daughters and nieces I\u2019m always very keen to impress upon them to have self-respect and look after themselves.\n\n\"They have a right to their own sexuality and it\u2019s important they cherish who they are as women.\n\n\u201cFrom that I \u00adbelieve the men around them may be more \u00adlikely to respect them. If you respect yourself first then people around you can respect you.\u201d\n\nWhile at Cambridge she joined the Footlights drama club \u2013 a legendary crucible of comedy and acting talent \u2013 and became friends with Tilda Swinton.\n\nAfter they graduated Tilda\u2019s career took off quickly but Joanna struggled.\n\nIn 2014 she said of those days: \u201cIt felt like I was trying to join in a party that I wasn\u2019t really invited to.\u201d\n\nNow Joanna\u2019s success has ensured a host of producers want her at the party.\n\nThe Accident continues on Channel 4 on Thursday at 9pm.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Joanna says she suffered crippling mental health problems after her student years but now teaches young people with cancer how acting can help", "authors": ["Jen Pharo", "Image", "Channel The Forge Warren Orcha", "Getty Images", "Warren Orchard.
