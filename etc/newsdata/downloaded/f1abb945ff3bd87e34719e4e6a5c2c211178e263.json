Mr Graham's wife Sam is allergic to cats and dogs hence the piglet pet\n\nBut the pig, called Grace, has now taken over the ground floor of their three-bedroom cottage. She is five feet long, stands waist-high to a human and gets through \u00a320 of food a week.\n\nGrace has become used to the finer things in life, scoffing on rice pudding with jelly or tinned peaches and refusing to sleep outside in a sty the Grahams built for her.\n\nBut rather than grow frustrated Mr Graham, a father of two girls, says Grace has become like a \u2018third daughter\u2019 to them. The family have even stopped eating bacon.\n\nMr Graham, 57, said that when he went to the farm to buy Grace, he was shown her parents. \u2018They were about knee-high, which is the size of a fully-grown micro pig,\u2019 he added. \u2018They were fed a couple of pig pellets a day, whereas Grace gets three big meals a day and treats.\n\n\u2018I think that\u2019s contributed to her size, really. Plus she get loads of exercise as well. So she is sturdy and powerful.\u2019 Grace has her own \u2018pig flap\u2019 so she can come and go as she pleases at the home in Malvern, Worcestershire, she shares with Mr and Mrs Graham, 48, and their younger daughter Xena, 29. She sleeps on an orthopaedic mattress in the living room and lounges on the family\u2019s sofa when they watch TV.\n\nNigel, a property developer, said: \u2018She will go outside but not if it\u2019s raining or it\u2019s windy. She\u2019s got quite used to her creature comforts and likes to stay cosy \u2013 and she\u2019s toilet trained so she\u2019s really clean.\n\n\u2018She\u2019s part of the family. She\u2019s not like a pig. It\u2019s no different than a dog or a cat, in fact she is cleaner than one of my daughters and shows me more love. Grace eats three full meals a day as well as pig pellets, fruit and left-overs from the family.\n\nGrace the pig enjoying the hot weather underneath the hammock in Malvern while Sam enjoys the sunshine with her pet by her side\n\nGrace has a custom-built pig pen with the plaque 'Graceland' which she has only used twice because she prefers to live in the house\n\nGrace the pig lying on her bed in the kitchen in front of the radiator which she prefers to living outside in her custom-made pen\n\nTrotters up: Grace relaxing on her bed in front of the radiator where she has an array of cushions and snoozes peacefully on her bed in the kitchen\n\n\u2018Bacon was my favourite meat but, since Grace has joined the family, we don\u2019t eat it any more as it just wouldn\u2019t feel right.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s great when people come into our house, not knowing about Grace, as their reactions are priceless.\u2019\n\nMr Graham says Grace is now fully grown \u2013 which comes as a relief to the family as micro pigs typically live up to 18 years.", "description": "Mr Graham, 57, from Malvern, Worcestershire, bought Grace, what he thought was a micro pig, for his wife Sam who is allergic to cats and dogs.
