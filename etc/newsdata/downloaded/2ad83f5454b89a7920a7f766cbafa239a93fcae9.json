Currently, Uba earns the equivalent of \u00a31.80 a day working on people\u2019s farms, but says they can go three weeks without being able to buy food, during which her neighbours give her any they have spare. Today, all Uba has had to eat is sorghum \u2013 and she is breastfeeding her youngest child, Bilan. \u2018If I cannot breastfeed, my baby cries,\u2019 she says. \u2018Sometimes I can get a lot of dizziness. There is not enough milk if I have not had enough to eat\u2019\n\nPhotograph: Abbie Trayler-Smith/Concern/Panos Pictures", "description": "In a series of images from Central African Republic, South Sudan and Liberia, a trio of award-winning photographers offer a personal take on child hunger", "authors": ["Photograph", "Chris De Bode Panos Pictures", "Abbie Trayler-Smith Concern Panos Pictures", "Nora Lorek Concern Panos Pictures", "Chris De Bode", "Abbie Trayler-Smith", "Nora Lorek"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc61e4d0d4113f2d2584902aa06029e15dd49f2f/0_241_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f88ed2829532808b6a5f7b814ccfd57a", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
