I love you so much it\u2019s actually stupid\u2026 And possibly illegal in the state of California,\u201d he tweeted on Thursday.\n\nShelton, 43, and his fellow \"The Voice\" judge are reaching another milestone in their relationship next month: four years of dating.\n\nThe couple first met on the set of \"The Voice\" in 2014 and sparks quickly flew.\n\nGWEN STEFANI DIDN'T KNOW WHO BOYFRIEND BLAKE SHELTON WAS BEFORE 'THE VOICE'\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually shocking that it has already been that long,\u201d Shelton admitted to People in June. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a blur. It still feels like it\u2019s pretty new to me. I guess it is, relatively. Four years isn\u2019t forever, but man, it seems like it just happened in no time.\u201d\n\nIf Shelton does throw Stefani a birthday party, he'd have to outdo the amazing pizza party she held at her house for Shelton's birthday back in June. She also gifted him a huge custom-made sign for his Oklahoma ranch.\n\nShelton also received handmade birthday cards from Stefani's kids. Kingston, 13, Zuma, 10, and Apollo, 5 (whom Stefani shares with ex-husband Gavin Rossdale) all spent time constructing their designs.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\u201cChristmas, birthdays, any kind of holiday \u2014 they always sit down and take time to write a message and draw pictures or something,\u201d he said. \u201cThose are the coolest, coolest things, you know? It\u2019s something I never experienced in my life. When they take time and actually make something, it\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d\n\nStefani was married to Rossdale between 2002 and 2016 while Shelton was married to Kaynette Gern between 2003 and 2006 and Miranda Lambert between 2011 and 2015.", "description": "There's No Doubt that Blake Shelton is head-over-heels in love with\u00a0girlfriend Gwen Stefani.", "authors": ["Jessica Napoli"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/03/Blake-Shelton-Gwen-Stefani-Getty.jpg"}
