He\u2019ll be either out of office or make a declaration that he\u2019s not running for re-election. Now you\u2019re going to have an open system in terms of who\u2019s going to be that nominee.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cTwo months from now, there\u2019ll be an impeachment inquiry. He\u2019ll be the third person to be impeached. Then you\u2019re also seeing cracks in the foundation of the Republican establishment which generally dislike the guy. They\u2019ll say good things about him right now because his supposed approval ratings in the Republican party are high. But I think those are superficial numbers.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs more of that information comes out, there\u2019ll be a Goldwater, Howard Baker moment where they\u2019re going to go to him saying, look. you got to leave,\u201d he continued. \u201cOr maybe they can negotiate something with Speaker Pelosi where he can stay until the end of his term. He\u2019s either leaving before the end of the term or not running for re-election. Okay? The level of illegality is so far and beyond what could be normal. This is still a country that\u2019s a rule of law country.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On Monday's broadcast of CNN's \"New Day,\" former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci predicted President Donald Trump would not be the nominee of the Republican party for the 2020 presidential election. | Clips", "authors": ["Pam Key"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/01/Moochbrother1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
