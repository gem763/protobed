All that\u2019s ever mattered, though, is that it parked up in Japan in prime shape for England\u2019s tilt at winning the Webb Ellis Trophy for a second time.\n\nThat appears to be the case.\n\nEngland\u2019s final hit-out of any consequence ahead of the first World Cup on Asian soil resulted in a 57-15 thrashing of Ireland at Twickenham last month. The way England overpowered the Irish in virtually every aspect revived memories of the winning run under Jones of 17 straight matches from February 2016 to March 2017, taking in two Six Nations titles (including one Grand Slam) and a rise to No. 2 in the world ranking behind the All Blacks.\n\nEngland fans sang their rugby anthem \u201cSwing Low, Sweet Chariot\u201d with gusto. All the talk then was of a two-way duel between England and New Zealand at the World Cup. But it hasn\u2019t quite worked out that way.\n\nEngland\u2019s slump was fairly dramatic, a fifth-place finish in the 2018 Six Nations - its worst in 30 years - being followed by a lost test series in South Africa. Selection was muddled, key injuries took hold, and it seemed like a storm was brewing around Jones.\n\nHe has dealt with it all, and will lead England into the World Cup in bullish mood, while also keeping his players on their toes.\n\n\u201cAre we moving in the right direction? Yes,\u201d Jones said. \u201cAre we ready to win the World Cup now? No.\u201d\n\nYet in the past year, some of his selections have crystallized, some maybe fortuitously, some fitness permitting.\n\nA back row of Billy Vunipola, Sam Underhill and Tom Curry. A midfield three of flyhalf George Ford and centers Owen Farrell and Manu Tuilagi. Joe Cokanasiga is now unlikely to be dislodged as opposite winger to Jonny May. Dylan Hartley\u2019s injuries have allowed Jones to ease Jamie George in as hooker without having to drop his captain.\n\nThere are two high-class options at fullback in Elliot Daly and Anthony Watson. The options at lock are formidable, with Maro Itoje and George Kruis still ahead of Joe Launchbury and Courtney Lawes.\n\nThen there\u2019s the unlikely story of Lewis Ludlam, who wasn\u2019t even in Northampton\u2019s top team at club level this time last year but was called into England\u2019s World Cup squad after just one international appearance. Watching him in that match against Wales last month was Sandra Taylor, Ludlam\u2019s former primary school teacher for whom he promised to get tickets if he made his England debut.\n\nIn many ways, there is an embarrassment of riches for England, which is to be expected for the world\u2019s richest rugby union.\n\nBut some issues still remain.\n\nOnly six months ago, Jones was doubting his players\u2019 mental resilience after they gave up a 31-0 lead against Scotland to draw 38-38 in a Six Nations match, saying he\u2019d hire a psychologist to help tackle their apparent inability to handle pressure. That pressure will only ramp up in a World Cup.\n\nFour years have passed and many players have come and gone, but have England truly gotten over the humiliation of being the first host nation to fail to get out of pool stage at a Rugby World Cup?\n\nGame-changing players like Tuilagi and Vunipola are susceptible to injury, especially when matches come thick and fast as they do in World Cups.\n\nAnd can anyone really just brush off Wales\u2019 domination of the English when it really mattered in the crucial match of this year\u2019s Six Nations, a 21-13 win for the Welsh in Cardiff?\n\nThen there\u2019s the tough group England finds itself in Japan, alongside France and Argentina. One of rugby\u2019s big gun is sure to fall before the knockout stage.\n\nA plus for England is that the team starts the World Cup with matches against the weakest opponents in the pool in the form of Tonga and the United States, giving the players a chance to settle into the competition and Jones the option to rotate some players.\n\nThen comes the moment of truth, when four years of planning are put to the test.\n\nJones guided Australia to the 2003 World Cup final on home soil, and was hailed as one of the masterminds behind South Africa\u2019s Rugby World Cup triumph in 2007, through his short-term role as technical adviser. As Japan coach, he helped deliver the most extraordinary moment of the 2015 Rugby World Cup when his team stunned the Springboks in the most unlikely win in the competition\u2019s history.\n\nHas the wily Australian got another trick up his sleeve four years on? Don\u2019t bet against it.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nSteve Douglas is at www.twitter.com/sdouglas80\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "It raced along at record-breaking speeds in 2016 and '17, required some repairs after spluttering in 2018, but appears to be running smoothly again in 2019.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Douglas"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
