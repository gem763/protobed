I think going swimming is the best solution to this because it can cool us down and it is quite relaxing. We can even work out a bit without worrying about getting all gross and sweaty.\n\nJasmine Cho Li, 14, Cheung Chuk Shan College\n\nI think taking a quick cold shower is the perfect way to cool down on a hot day. Every day, when I get home all sweaty and smelly, I immediately hop in the shower. It feels like paradise in there as the cool water washes away all the dirt and sweat off my body. I love the feeling when I step out of feeling cool and comfortable again.\n\nChloe Lau Hong-ching, 13, St Mary\u2019s Canossian College\n\n5 essential tips for hiking when it's still sweltering\n\nMy favourite way to cool down would definitely be chowing down on a huge piece of watermelon. Especially when it\u2019s been sitting in the refrigerator for a while. This is the perfect cure to the summer heat.\n\nBethany Chow Sze-yuet, 13, St Mary\u2019s Canossian College\n\nWhen the weather gets unbearably hot, I like to gobble up some cool, juicy and sweet fruits such as watermelon, grapes, and lychees. My recent favourite has been peaches. They can be a little expensive but they\u2019re worth the cost!\n\nCharmaine Leung, 11, St Mary\u2019s Canossian School\n\nI wear a special vest to cool off. It has portable fans that prevents my body from getting too hot throughout the day, just like an air conditioner cools down a room.\n\nJenny Fung, 13, Law Ting Pong Secondary School\n\n7 more tips for staying cool when the temperature soars\n\nWhen the temperature is high, I go straight to my bathtub and fill it with buckets of ice-cold water. Then, I like to prop up my tablet on the side so I can watch movies and catch up on the news on the Young Post website.\n\nDaniel Lee Tsz-tan, 13, Law Ting Pong Secondary School\n\nI always come home from school with sweat trickling down my face. And the first thing I do is open the freezer so I can pop an ice cube into my mouth, grab a wet towel that I have frozen earlier, and then make a shake with frozen watermelon. Every sip takes me back to the time I went to Hawaii.\n\nYoonjung Choi, 14, Hong Kong International School\n\nI love spending the whole day at the beach on a hot day. I take a dip in the sea and have an ice cream cone as I enjoy the sun.\n\nMelody Ma, 13, Carmel Pak U Secondary School\n\nTop summer movies 2019: From Toy Story 4 to The Lion King, here are the hottest blockbusters to visit if you missed them this summer\n\nWhen I\u2019m feeling hot, I cool down by drinking a lot of cold drinks. I know it\u2019s not very healthy, but it\u2019s the only thing that can cool me from the inside-out. You should try it!\n\nJoey Zhong, 11, Methodist College\n\nI love making my own slurpees at home, like the ones you can get in 7-Eleven. All you need to is carefully blend some ice until it is broken down into small pieces, and then top it off with your favourite cordial. It\u2019s not only delicious, but also incredibly refreshing.\n\nKiya Chase, 11, International College Hong Kong", "description": "We asked our readers for their favourite way to beat the heat on a hot day.
