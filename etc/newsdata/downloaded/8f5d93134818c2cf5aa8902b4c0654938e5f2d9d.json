Hussein and his descendants are seen by Shiites as the rightful heirs to the prophet. Hussein\u2019s killing has been attributed with cementing the schism between Shiite and Sunni Islam.\n\nIn recent years, Ashoura processions have been attacked by extremist Sunni militants but Tuesday\u2019s commemorations were peaceful until the walkway collapsed.\n\nThe incident took place during the so-called \u201cTweireej\u201d run, when tens of thousands of people run toward the shrine of Imam Hussein in Karbala around noon.\n\nThe 2-3 kilometer (1-2 mile) run symbolizes when maternal cousins of Imam Hussein\u2019s half-brother al-Abbas ran from the nearby village of Tweireej to rescue him only to find out that he was killed.\n\nEarlier in the day, hundreds of thousands held Ashoura processions amid beefed-up security in Karbala and in the capital, Baghdad, marching through the streets. Many of the faithful beat their chests and lashed themselves with chains in a symbolic expression of grief and regret for not being able to help Hussein before his martyrdom.\n\nOn Sunday night, thousands marched toward the holy shrine of Imam Hussein in Karbala, which had been lit up on the eve of the celebration.\n\n___\n\nKaram reported from Beirut.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Part of a walkway collapsed as tens of thousands of people celebrated Ashoura on Tuesday, causing a stampede and killing at least 31 pilgrims on one of the most sacred religious holy days for the Shiite sect, officials said.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Qassim Abdul-Zahra", "Zeina Karam"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/10/iraq_muharram_04694_c0-0-3722-2170_s1770x1032.jpg?2ed93dd7c3e439b6601c5a13fb333f2965a0049a", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
