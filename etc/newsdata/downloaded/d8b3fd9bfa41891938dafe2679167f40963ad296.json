I wanted to show the raw, the messy, the unflattering. This is a woman holding it together,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018One of the challenges for [my] character is the trauma and turmoil going on in her private life, and the toll that that takes on her emotionally, physically, mentally, versus the character that she is when she has to get up, put on a face and smile to America.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJen has had a tough few years, with all eyes on her personal life following high-profile splits from Brad Pitt and Justin Theroux.\n\nJennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt broke up in 2005 (Picture: Rex)\n\nShe is also constantly questioned over her plans to start a family, and whether she is ready to start dating again after her marriage to Justin broke down.\n\nComparing her life to Alex, she added to the Daily Telegraph: \u2018I can relate to that. Of course there are times when you don\u2019t want anyone to see you, or you don\u2019t want to be photographed or even go out of the house.\n\n\u2018Nothing is as it seems in a glossy magazine.\u2019\n\nJennifer\u2019s words come after she literally broke the internet, following her arrival on Instagram.\n\nDespite being one of the biggest stars in the world \u2013 and most recognisable \u2013 she took her time logging into the app herself.\n\nBut the second she signed up, and shared a photo of the Friends gang back together again, fans were so beside themselves with trying to give her a follow that the whole thing crashed.\n\nYes, seriously.\n\nWhen a fan asked why they couldn\u2019t follow her, she simply replied: \u2018Sorry, I think I broke it.\u2019\n\nOf course.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne person who did manage to follow Jen is ex-husband Justin, who even took a second to welcome the actress into the madness.\n\nSliding into the comments, he wrote: \u2018Woot-woot! #first,\u2019 with the praising hands emoji.\n\nEx goals? We think so.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
