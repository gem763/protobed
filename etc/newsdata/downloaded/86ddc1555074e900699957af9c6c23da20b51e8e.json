Dairy Dream Hi-Protein Greek Style Strained Yoghurt - 17g protein per serve\n\nGreek-style yoghurt consistently features at the top of many nutritionists must-have healthy food lists because it's packed with calcium and is sugar-free.\n\nLyndi said she is particularly fond of natural yoghurt because of the beneficial effects on gut bacteria.\n\nEmerging evidence suggests an unbalanced gut (or microbiome) can affect immunity, mood, stress levels and metabolism.\n\nDairy Dream Hi-Protein Greek Style Strained Yoghurt, priced at $4.99 (pictured) gets the tick of approval from Lyndi who says it is great for gut health\n\n'Greek yoghurt is also the highest dietary source of probiotics, so including plain Greek yoghurt into your diet is a much cheaper (and tastier) way to boost gut health compared to supplements,' she told FEMAIL.\n\nLyndi gives Dairy Dream Hi-Protein Greek Style Strained Yoghurt, priced at $4.99 for 900g, the tick of approval as a single-serve contains 17g of protein.\n\nShe added a serving of the yoghurt will also give you 27 per cent of your daily recommended intake for calcium.\n\n2. Baker's Life 85% Lower Carb Bread - 23.6g of protein for two slices\n\nWhile many watching their weight are likely to eschew carbs, Lyndi believes the food group is essential.\n\nHowever, she added it's always better to try to make the healthiest choice you can.\n\nAldi's Baker's Life low GI bread provides 23.6g of protein for two slices, (an amount well above other options) and also contains 10.7g of fibre per sandwich serve.\n\nAldi's Baker's Life 85% Lower Carb Bread (pictured) ticks many of Lyndi's health boxes\n\n'Normal white bread is often made up mostly of refined flour, however, this option is made using seeds and whole grains providing healthy fats, protein and fibre,' Lyndi said.\n\n'I don't recommend looking for 'low carb' options if you want to eat healthier but this bread does tick many health boxes.'\n\n3. Just Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nExtra virgin olive oil is widely regarded by experts as a powerhouse food because it is packed with healthy fats and antioxidants.\n\nAdditionally, evidence suggests those who live in regions where olive oil is consumed in high quantities as part of a Mediterranean diet tend to live longer lives.\n\nThe Mediterranean diet consists of plant-based foods such as vegetables, legumes, fruit, nuts, seeds and olives, lots of extra virgin olive oil, fish, and moderate red wine intake.\n\n'You will often have to pay a premium for extra virgin olive oil because it's higher quality than plain olive oil, so [this product from Aldi] is a very good price.' Lyndi said.\n\nWhat are antioxidants? * The process of oxidation in the human body produces unstable chemicals called free radicals, which damage cell membranes and other structures. * Free radicals have been linked to a variety of diseases, including heart disease and certain cancers. * Antioxidants are compounds in foods that scavenge and neutralise free radicals.

Natural & Delicious Rolled Oats - 6.5g of fibre per serve\n\nWhen it comes to a powerhouse breakfast, Lyndi said you can't go past a bowl of oats topped with yoghurt, seeds and nuts.\n\nThe nutritionist said as far as she was concerned rolled oats should be a pantry staple as the food was a slow-release carb, one perfect for sustained energy.\n\n'This product [by Aldi] is 100 per cent whole grains and contains an impressive 6.5g of fibre per serve and is a source of protein,' she said.\n\nTwo of Lyndi's Aldi health food staples include Natural & Delicious Rolled Oats (pictured left) and Organic Extra virgin olive oil (pictured right)\n\n'If you want extra energy in the morning, I'd recommend a bowl of oats with yoghurt and some seeds and nuts,' she said.\n\n'Per serve, you'll only spend $0.72 which is incredibly affordable.'\n\n5. Almare Fresh Atlantic Salmon Fillets \u2013 0.8g carbs per 140g serve\n\nSalmon comes with the benefit of being a lean source of protein, as well as one that's packed with Omega-3 essential fatty acids\n\nWhat is the Keto diet? The Ketogenic diet defines a low-carb, high-fat way of eating. Following this eating plan forces the body into a metabolic state, known as ketosis, which starves the body of carbohydrates but not calories. Carbs are shunned in the keto diet as they cause the body to produce glucose, which is used as energy over fat. Keto diets therefore lead to weight loss as they make the body burn fat as its primary energy source.\n\nSalmon comes with the benefit of being a lean source of protein, as well as one packed with Omega-3 essential fatty acids.\n\nAs well as being laden with brain-power boosting Omega-3s, the fish also contains B1, B2, B3, B6 and B12.\n\nThis is a vitamin group that helps with keeping stress levels in check as well as energy and cell production.\n\nAccording to Melissa Meier, Aldi's offering is ideal for those following a Ketogenic diet as a single 140g serve contains a mere 0.8g of carbs.\n\n'It's also super versatile - perfect when smoked for breakfast, flaked in a salad for lunch or tossed through a stir fry for dinner,' she told Body + Soul.\n\n6. Manhattan Low Fat Cottage Cheese - 5.4g carbs per 125g serve\n\nIf you're leaning towards a diet which is higher in fat, then cottage cheese is the ideal addition.\n\n'It is [cottage cheese] high in protein to help maintain lean muscle mass, and provides calcium to keep your bones strong,' Melissa said.\n\nA high protein diet can help a person build muscle mass, reduce appetite, and burn fat, which can lead to weight loss, reports Medical News Today.\n\nMelissa Meier's healthy Aldi essentials include Manhattan Low Fat Cottage Cheese (pictured left) and Forresters Natural Macadamia Kernels (pictured right)\n\n7. Forresters Natural Macadamia Kernels \u2013 1.7g carbs per 30g serve\n\nMacadamias contain a low proportion of saturated fats and are rich in heart-friendly monounsaturated fats, similar to those in olive oil.\n\nWhile there are misconceptions nuts are fattening, regular nut eaters tend to weigh less and gain less weight over time, reports AustralianMacadamias.org.\n\nIn addition to being laden with healthy fats, macadamias are packed with protein and fibre meaning they're more filling when eaten as a snack or part of a meal.\n\nMelissa also said the nuts are also a good source of thiamin, a b-group vitamin that plays a role in energy production) and magnesium for nerve function.\n\nStudies have found that regular nut consumption reduces the risk of stroke, boosts cognitive function in the elderly and the phytochemicals in macadamias may help to protect the brain from damage over time.", "description": "Two Australian dietitians have revealed their best health food buys from Aldi.
