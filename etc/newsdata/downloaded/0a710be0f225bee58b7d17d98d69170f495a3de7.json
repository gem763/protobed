It\u2019s the latest example of the growing popularity of this transparent, glass-like material that could one day unseat silicon and cut energy use worldwide.\n\nFor decades, silicon has been the backbone of the technology industry, but we are \u201creaching a theoretical limit on how much it can be improved,\u201d says Danqing Wang, a doctoral candidate at Harvard University who conducts GaN research. All materials have a \u201cband gap,\u201d which is related to how well they can conduct electricity. GaN has a wider band gap than silicon, which means it can sustain higher voltages than silicon can survive, and the current can run through the device faster, says Martin Kuball, a physicist at the University of Bristol who leads a project on GaN in power electronics. (In the video, above, Kuball helps to explain GaN as the Verge Science team tears apart Anker\u2019s new charger.)\n\nAs a result, GaN electronics are far more efficient than their silicon counterparts, and they lose less energy. \u201cYou can make things very small, or you can pack more GaN in the same area,\u201d says Wang. \u201cThe performance is better.\u201d And when you lose less energy, not only can you make charging devices smaller, but you can also use less power in the first place. According to Kuball, replacing all current electronics with GaN could potentially cut power use by 10 or 25 percent.\n\nPlus, because GaN can survive at higher temperatures than silicon, using it can influence design in more complicated environments. Right now, the electronics in a car are mounted far away from the engine to keep them from getting too hot, says Kuball. GaN erases this constraint and could open up new possibilities that change how cars are designed in the future.\n\nThe material has long been dominant in another area: lasers and photonics. GaN is one of the few materials to give off blue light; it\u2019s used in Blu-rays to make disc-reading possible. It\u2019s also frequently used in LEDs. Wang\u2019s team is making tiny GaN lasers the size of a micron \u2014 which is 1/100th the size of a human hair and too small to see with the naked eye \u2014 that can be used in microscopes to make research more precise.\n\n\u201cIt takes some effort to switch to gallium nitride.\u201d\n\nPhotonics aside, why haven\u2019t we replaced silicon with GaN yet? \u201cSilicon is very mature,\u201d says Kuball. \u201cPeople are used to it and have been doing this for a long time, and obviously what you find when you introduce a new type of material or electronic is that you need to keep testing it for reliability.\u201d GaN isn\u2019t a perfect material either, adds Wang, because some methods of growing it can cause defects that make it less effective.\n\nBut we\u2019re used to silicon. It\u2019s cheap, and all the manufacturing techniques are already set up for it. GaN is still a little more expensive. \u201cIt takes some effort to switch to gallium nitride,\u201d says Wang, though she points out that some people are looking at ways to grow gallium nitride crystals on top of silicon in the hopes of taking advantage of the existing manufacturing platforms. For their part, Anker says that though GaN is more expensive than silicon right now, GaN chargers need fewer components than silicon chargers, which makes their price competitive. The company hopes to use GaN materials in other components, including portable batteries.\n\nLarge semiconductor manufacturers like Texas Instruments and Nexperia do have GaN research programs, according to Kuball, and there\u2019s no shortage of startups working on the technology. Still, we have yet to see the true impact of GaN in the power electronics field. \u201cThese little adapters are a nice toy, but where GaN will really matter is in converters for electric cars and photovoltaics,\u201d Kuball adds. In the meantime, \u201cit\u2019s a cool little thing to have something smaller.\u201d\n\nUpdate February 12th, 2019, 10AM ET: This article was originally published on November 2nd, 2018, and it has been updated to include the video.\n\nUpdate November 2nd, 2018, 9:20AM: This post has been updated to include a statement from Anker.", "description": "Products are slowly appearing that replace silicon with gallium nitride, a material that promises to shrink technology down while making it more efficient.
