We\u2019re here because we really think we\u2019re going to turn this state and make it a Republican state.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s rally in Rio Rancho, in suburban Albuquerque, is the first stop on a three-day swing that will also take him to California for fundraisers expected to raise more than $15 million.\n\nTrump has generally held his rallies in Republican-friendly terrain. Monday\u2019s rally represents a striking departure from that practice and demonstrates a campaign with the resources to try to turn a few Democratic-leaning states his way, similar to what happened in 2016 with Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nTrump captured just 40% of the state vote in 2016, as compared to the 48% that went for Hillary Clinton. She did not visit the state during the 2016 campaign.\n\nStill, campaign officials say a Trump rally in nearby El Paso, Texas, last February was well attended by female and Hispanic voters and travelers from New Mexico, indicating to them that New Mexico is in play. Hundreds of people showed up early Monday to claim a place in line ahead of the evening event in Rio Rancho.\n\nDianna Arvizu, an El Paso, Texas-native who now lives in Albuquerque, was among those in the crowd. She said Trump has a strong chance at capturing New Mexico.\n\nShe called his visit \u201cbig,\u201d saying \u201cHe\u2019s coming for us in New Mexico because he cares.\u201d\n\nProtesters, for their part, vowed to step up acts of civil disobedience and demonstrations.\n\n\u201cWe have the opportunity because of our fundraising and infrastructure to not only defend the states we carried in 2016, but to extend the map in 2020,\u201d said Rick Gorka, a spokesman for a fundraising committee for Trump\u2019s reelection campaign and the Republican National Committee.\n\nGorka said New Mexico is a big part of that strategy, as are Minnesota, New Hampshire and Nevada.\n\nTrump\u2019s efforts in New Mexico will provide a test of how well his often-harsh rhetoric about immigrants will play with Hispanic voters, who comprise nearly 40% of New Mexico\u2019s electorate.\n\nNew Mexico is in the midst of an oil production boom that has boosted employment and spurred a state government spending spree from first-year Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on public education, roadway projects and tax rebates for film productions.\n\nThe Green New Deal calls for virtual elimination by 2030 of greenhouse gas emissions responsible for global warming and meeting 100% of U.S. power demand through renewable and zero-emission energy sources, including nuclear power. The proposal has broad support among Democratic activists and 2020 presidential contenders, putting it at the forefront of the party\u2019s sprawling presidential primary.\n\nLujan Grisham took aim at Trump ahead of his visit, describing the president as being demeaning to Hispanics and immigrants since being elected. She also said Trump\u2019s policies had resulted in increased taxes for some New Mexicans.\n\nTrump will follow up his rally by flying to the San Francisco Bay Area on Tuesday for a luncheon fundraiser. He\u2019ll then attend a fundraising dinner that evening in Beverly Hills at the home of real estate developer Geoffrey Palmer. He has two more fundraisers planned in Los Angeles and San Diego on Wednesday.\n\nThe fundraisers will benefit Trump Victory, the joint entity that funds Trump\u2019s reelection campaign and the Republican National Committee.", "description": "President Donald Trump made a pocketbook appeal for reelection in the Democratic-leaning state of New Mexico on Monday, telling voters that his energy...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR414_19trum_ZG_20190916225858.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
