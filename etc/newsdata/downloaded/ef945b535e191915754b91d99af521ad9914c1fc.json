And now everyone is watching him bat in amazement, and trying to learn from him.\n\n\u201cThe textbooks on batting technique may need to be rewritten.\u201d\n\nAustralian cricket was thrown into turmoil 18 months ago when Smith, his vice-captain David Warner and batsman Cameron Bancroft were banned for their roles in a ball-tampering scandal in South Africa.\n\nSmith and Warner have been repeatedly booed and mocked by the crowds in England and while Warner has scored just 79 runs from eight innings during the Ashes, Smith has seen himself compared to Australian great Don Bradman.\n\n\u201cSmith\u2019s run is extraordinary, considering the sort of pressure he was under,\u201d said Gilchrist, who played 96 tests for Australia. \u201cIt (heckling) was expected from the England crowds.\n\n\u201cSmith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft took responsibility for their actions. Smith has utilised the time away to come back mentally tougher.\u201d\n\nWhile Tim Paine\u2019s side managed to retain the Ashes urn with their victory in the fourth test in Manchester, Gilchrist feels the Australian side was far from a settled outfit.\n\n\u201cTravis Head, Marnus Labuschagne, Marcus Harris, Cameron Bancroft \u2014 they are still finding their feet in test cricket. I don\u2019t think anyone has secured their spot in the Australian team, apart from Steve Smith,\u201d the 47-year-old said.", "description": "Steve Smith's unorthodox batting technique is not something a purist will advocate to budding players, but his monstrous run-scoring ability might force coaching manuals to be rewritten, former Australia cricketer Adam Gilchrist has said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1428962239&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B0BX", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
