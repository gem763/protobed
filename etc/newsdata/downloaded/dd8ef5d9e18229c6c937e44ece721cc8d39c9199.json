As Nielsen\u2019s deputy chief of staff, Taylor was included on some of the DHS secretary\u2019s emails and privy to her events schedule, often prepping his boss with reports and talking points ahead of public appearances between April and June 2018, when the family separation policy was in effect. In one email obtained by BuzzFeed News, Taylor assisted Nielsen in preparing what he described as the \u201cProtecting Children Narrative\u201d \u2014 the department\u2019s spin on a policy that horrified Americans when images of abandoned, caged migrant children in squalid camps emerged. Other emails from Nielsen\u2019s events planner show that he had been scheduled to participate in at least two weekly calls to \u201cdiscuss Border Security and Immigration Enforcement\u201d in June 2018. Two former DHS officials dismissed Google\u2019s claim that Taylor \u2014 who last month joined the company as a government affairs and public policy manager advising on national security issues \u2014 could have kept his hands clean from the policy. Nielsen\u2019s staff had a very \u201ctight inner camp\u201d that included Taylor, said one former DHS official, who spoke to BuzzFeed News anonymously to preserve personal relationships. They noted that any policy or decision moving off the secretary\u2019s desk would have had Taylor\u2019s eyes on it. \u201cThe idea that you could disassociate from a policy that consumed the entire department while you were deputy chief of staff is ridiculous,\u201d the former official said.\n\nGoogle declined to comment. Taylor did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nBuzzFeed News / Via Instagram\n\nLast Thursday, amid concerns about Google\u2019s hiring of a former Department of Homeland Security staffer, executives at the search and advertising giant attempted to assuage employees\u2019 worries by stating that their new government relations manager had not been involved in the Trump administration policy of migrant family separation. During an all-hands meeting at Google\u2019s Mountain View, California, headquarters, Vice President of Public Affairs and Public Policy Karan Bhatia assured some agitated employees that Taylor had not been involved in one of the Trump era\u2019s most divisive policies, which the company\u2019s own executives spoke out against last year. Emails obtained by BuzzFeed News, however, cast serious doubt on those claims. Scrutiny of Taylor\u2019s hiring comes at a time of heightened discord among Google\u2019s rank-and-file, following a tumultuous 18 months in which workers have protested the company\u2019s handling of sexual misconduct, business plans in China, and relationships with the US military. In leaked audio from Thursday\u2019s meeting reported by the Washington Post, Google CEO Sundar Pichai lamented the mistrust between employees and management, and the nature by which the company\u2019s internal affairs were making their way outside of Google\u2019s walls. It was at that meeting that Bhatia also addressed Taylor\u2019s hiring, only hours after the company had removed two posts about the matter from an internal message board used by employees to ask and vote on questions for management. The deletion of those questions, which the company said violated its internal policies, worried some employees who felt that management was trying to squelch debate around a contentious issue. BuzzFeed News reported last Monday that Taylor had joined on Google. \u201cI\u2019ll say that the press reports that you will have seen contain a number of important inaccuracies in them,\u201d Bhatia said, appearing to reference BuzzFeed News\u2019 earlier reporting. \u201cFirst of all, he was not involved in the formation of the travel ban \u2014 the Muslim ban. He was not in the administration when the ban was issued.\u201d BuzzFeed News did not report that Taylor had helped to draft the travel ban, which barred visitors from six majority-Muslim countries in early 2017. Instead, it noted his public defense of a subsequent iteration of the policy as a DHS official later that year.\n\n\u201cHe was also not involved in the family separation policy,\u201d Bhatia told employees, referencing an immigration enforcement initiative that led to the separation of immigrant children from their parents and relatives at the southern border during the spring of 2018. \u201cSo I just would say that the press articles sometimes on these things are misleading.\u201d Nielsen\u2019s emails suggest otherwise. In August 2018, BuzzFeed News filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request with the Department of Homeland Security seeking all emails Nielsen sent and received since June 1, 2017, as well as her call logs and minutes from meetings she and her aides attended. When DHS failed to respond to the request, BuzzFeed News sued to compel the agency to produce Nielsen\u2019s emails. Over the past year, DHS has released thousands of pages of emails from her inbox, though it aggressively redacted the communications citing exemptions under FOIA that protect personal privacy and information that would be considered \u201cdeliberative.\u201d Still, unredacted portions of emails on which Taylor was included and others he sent to Nielsen reveal that he weighed in on and was privy to immigration matters as DHS dealt with a family separation policy that engulfed the department in controversy. On May 5, 2018, Nielsen sent an email to Taylor; Chad Wolf, her chief of staff; and Jonathan Hoffman, DHS assistant secretary for public affairs, asking for \u201cnarratives\u201d by 10 the next morning. Days before, a caravan of Central American immigrants had made its way to the US\u2013Mexico border in Tijuana.The Trump administration\u2019s family separation was already in effect, after then\u2013attorney general Jeff Sessions\u2019 call in April for a \u201czero tolerance policy\u201d for border-crossing offenses. The following day, Taylor responded. \u201cMadam Secretary, attached is the updated Caravan Narrative and the Protecting Children Narrative,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe narratives for TPS and Refugees/Asylees are forthcoming. Will have those to you within the hour.\u201d TPS likely refers to \u201cTemporary Protected Status,\u201d said a former DHS official, and describes asylum-seekers who are allowed to live in the US for a limited time due to unrest or conflict in their home countries.\n\nJason Leopold / BuzzFeed News / Via Department of Homeland Security\n\nAs deputy chief of staff, Taylor helped draft written testimony for the DHS secretary, which Nielsen called \u201cseriously well done\u201d ahead of a Senate hearing titled \u201cAuthorities and Resources Needed to Protect and Secure the United States.\u201d The testimony addressed cybersecurity, FEMA, and terrorism \u2014 but made DHS\u2019s priority clear.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to critical needs, there is probably no issue more important for DHS right now than border security and immigration,\u201d Nielsen said on May 15 to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. At the hearing, California Sen. Kamala Harris would go on to grill the secretary, prompting her to falsely claim, \u201cWe do not have a policy to separate children from their parents.\u201d In another heavily redacted email from May 21, Taylor relayed information to Nielsen from the Department of Justice\u2019s Executive Office for Immigration Review, which is responsible for adjudicating US immigration cases. That same day, Nielsen leaned on Taylor and Wolf after reading a morning news briefing, which included a sampling of President Trump\u2019s tweets and summaries of articles about DHS, that had been prepared for her office. \u201cCan we verify and get more info on this: Between October 2017 and April 2018, \u2018nearly two-thirds of all such immigrants arrested by ICE\u2026 had no criminal convictions,\u2019 a 21 precent increase from the year prior,\u201d she wrote, referencing a story from the Hill in the bulletin. The emails obtained by BuzzFeed News did not include any responses to Nielsen\u2019s request from Taylor or Wolf. A second former DHS official told BuzzFeed News that while Taylor was mainly focused on cybersecurity, terrorism, and aviation issues at the department, his role as deputy chief of staff would have involved him in discussions about immigration enforcement policies like family separation. They noted that chiefs of staff were usually in most meetings with the secretary and would have been tracking the department\u2019s major initiatives. That appears to be the case according to Nielsen\u2019s email scheduler, whose \u201cWeekly call to discuss Border Security and Immigration Enforcement\u201d listed Nielsen, deputy DHS secretary Claire Grady, Customs and Border Protection commissioner Kevin McAleenan, director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services Lee Francis Cissna, Wolf, and Taylor \u2014 all of whom no longer hold their positions \u2014 as scheduled participants for an eventually canceled event on June 1. Taylor was also on a list of participants for a similar call on June 19.\n\nJason Leopold / BuzzFeed News / Via Department of Homeland Security", "description": "\u201cThe idea that you could disassociate from a policy that consumed the entire department while you were deputy chief of staff is ridiculous,\u201d one former DHS official told BuzzFeed News.", "authors": ["Ryan Mac", "Buzzfeed News Reporter", "Jason Leopold"], "top_image": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2019-10/28/18/enhanced/86a9c45c4102/original-1669-1572288041-2.jpg?crop=1244:651;0,89", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
