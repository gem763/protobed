The poll was conducted between the 23 and 25 of October.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Kate Holton; Editing by Alex Richardson)", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative Party holds a 16-point lead over the opposition Labour Party ahead of a parliamentary vote on Monday on whether to hold a snap general election, according to an Opinium poll.
