I think we are losing something. It's very weird, you think VAR is helping football but then it's not.\"\n\nAsked about Deulofeu's appeal for a spot-kick, he added: \"It's a penalty, I have no idea (why it wasn't given).\"\n\nThe Spaniard also rued the fact that his side, who remain bottom of the table, could not take all the points after a mature display against last season's Champions League finalists.\n\n\"I think we deserved the three points because in the end we didn't concede very clear chances,\" he added.\n\n\"It's difficult to come here and control the game. All we could do was defend well and limit the opponent and that's what we did.\"\n\nTottenham coach Mauricio Pochettino said the mistake on the VAR screen had nothing to do with his club and was a Premier League issue.\n\nHe also said the way his side managed to salvage a point might help steer them back on course after a rotten run, including a 7-2 thrashing at the hands of Bayern Munich and a 3-0 loss to Brighton and Hove Albion.\n\n\"After Bayern our confidence was on the floor. It was so important the way we achieved the point in the end, we kept fighting,\" Pochettino said.\n\n\"I hope this is the first step we need to build our confidence again.\"", "description": "VAR is very subjective, says Watford's Sanchez Flores", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9I0IE_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
