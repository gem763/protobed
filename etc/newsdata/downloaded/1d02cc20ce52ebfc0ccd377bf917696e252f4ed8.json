For \u201cyounger kids,\u201d the app will be limited to things like Disney soundtracks, songs about dinosaurs, and children\u2019s stories. If parents set the app up for an \u201colder kid,\u201d then it will add pop hits from artists like Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande, and Bruno Mars.\n\nSpotify editors are looking at more than whether a song contains foul language when determining if it\u2019s an appropriate fit for this app. References to guns and violence, for example, could be disqualifying, too. Song selections will also change by region, with editors creating different playlists based on what\u2019s popular in each area.\n\nThe app requires a Spotify Premium Family subscription, which costs $14.99 per month in the US (or \u20ac14.99 per month in Ireland). Partly, that\u2019s because Spotify Kids won\u2019t show ads, which is a feature exclusive to paying listeners. Each kid\u2019s account will count toward one of the six total accounts allowed under the family plan.\n\nSpotify has also created a separate privacy policy that it says is compliant with both GDPR and COPPA, the American online privacy law for kids. It won\u2019t collect location data (region restrictions are based on whatever the parent\u2019s account is set to), and parents can delete data associated with a kid\u2019s account at any time. Spotify only saves data related to what songs a kid is playing and favoriting; it says that data will neither be sold nor shared with third parties.\n\nThe app, available on both iOS and Android, looks like a streamlined version of Spotify, stripped back to just a single feed filled with colorful playlists. Kids are meant to poke around at recognizable movie characters and different illustrations that Spotify has made (like a smiling guitar or a bouncing bucket of popcorn) or tap on artists they recognize if they\u2019re old enough. Kids can search if they want to find something specific, though they can\u2019t browse by artist or album. The app is really just meant to be browsed through the curated playlists Spotify has put together. In a particularly cute touch, kids get to choose between one of 12 adorable monster avatars, and the color scheme of the app will change based on what they pick.\n\nSpotify characterizes the initial launch of this app as a beta and says it\u2019ll be rolling out to more markets over time. The company says it\u2019s spent more than two years working on Spotify Kids and that it\u2019s consulted with kids\u2019 content experts along the way. The app is meant for kids between three and 10 years old.\n\nFor Spotify, the Kids app could offer a couple of big wins. For one, it makes the Family plan more valuable for parents who might already be considering splitting one between themselves. Beyond that, it\u2019s also an early way to bring kids into the company\u2019s ecosystem. There\u2019s no way to move accounts between Spotify Kids and Spotify proper right now, but once kids are ready to move on from the children\u2019s app, there\u2019s really only one place to go \u2014 especially since they\u2019re already on a family plan.\n\nOnce it\u2019s available, the app seems likely to be a must-download for parents who already subscribe to Spotify. If you\u2019re planning to let your kid poke around Spotify anyway to listen to Disney soundtracks, Spotify Kids gives them an easier, simpler, and more appropriate place to do that. And even if you don\u2019t care about what they\u2019re listening to, it\u2019ll at least save your Spotify recommendations from being filled with kids\u2019 songs.", "description": "Spotify is launching a new app called Spotify Kids.
