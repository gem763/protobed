A reason was not given for the change.\n\nMr Clements on Thursday said he couldn't recall discussing donations with Mr Huang on April 7 and insisted Mr Cheah oversaw CFL fundraising efforts.\n\nMr Clements on Wednesday said he was given $35,000 in cash in a wine box by Mr Huang at his Mosman mansion with a letter in English explaining the money was for his legal bills.\n\nHe was in August 2015 embroiled in a sexual harassment scandal - which ultimately prompted his January 2016 resignation - and used half of the cash to pay legal fees.\n\nHe told the inquiry he never told the party about the \"personal gift\", saying he had stepped aside as general secretary at that time and hadn't thought he'd return to the job.\n\nMr Clements said he could see there was a risk the gift placed him in \"a position of compromise\" but said he didn't feel that risk.\n\nThe inquiry continues.", "description": "Former NSW Labor general secretary Jamie Clements admits he arranged for Chinese billionaire Huang Xiangmo to meet then-federal opposition leader Bill...", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
