(AP) - Vaping products, one of the fastest-growing segments of the legal marijuana industry, have taken a hit from consumers as public health experts scramble to determine what\u2019s causing a mysterious and sometimes fatal lung disease among people who use e-cigarettes.\n\nThe ailment has sickened at least 530 people and killed nine. Some vaped nicotine, but many reported using oil containing THC, marijuana\u2019s high-inducing ingredient, and said they bought products from pop-up shops and other illegal sellers. The only death linked to THC vapes bought at legal shops occurred in Oregon.\n\nAmid the health scare, the amount of the legal pot industry\u2019s revenue that comes from vape products has dropped by 15% nationwide, with some states, including Oregon, seeing decreases of more than 60%.\n\nHealth officials in California, home to the world\u2019s largest legal marijuana marketplace, this week issued an advisory urging people to stop all forms of vaping until a cause is determined. Massachusetts, which like California allows so-called recreational use of marijuana by people 21 and older, went further than any other state, issuing a four-month ban on vape sales.\n\nVaping THC is popular for those who want a quick high but don\u2019t want the smoke that comes from lighting up a joint. Marijuana companies are trying to boost the public\u2019s confidence by promoting that their vaping products are tested by the government, demanding ingredient lists from their vendors and in some cases pulling items from shelves. Some also are scrambling to get liability insurance.\n\nStill, many have seen notable declines in sales in the few weeks since the health scare emerged on a national scale.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s having an impact on how consumers are behaving,\u201d said David Alport, owner of Bridge City Collective in Portland, which in two weeks saw a 31% drop in sales of vape cartridges that hold the oil that vaporizes when heated. \u201cPeople are concerned, and we\u2019re concerned.\u201d\n\nIn the United States\u2019 booming legal cannabis market, vaping products have exploded in popularity. In roughly two years, they have grown from a small fraction of overall sales to about one-third, with $9.6 billion in sales between 2017 and 2019, according to New Frontier Data, an economic analysis firm that tracks the industry. About one-fifth of U.S. cannabis consumers report using them.\n\nNew Frontier found a 15% decline in the market share for vape sales nationwide during the first week of September and saw no rebound in data collected through Sept. 18. At the state level, New Mexico, Massachusetts, Nevada and Montana all saw drops of one-third or more, while California fell by 6%.\n\nOregon, which announced its death at the beginning of the month and said it was from a vape purchased at a regulated dispensary, saw one of the biggest drops in market share for vape revenue - 62%, said John Kagia, the firm\u2019s chief knowledge officer.\n\nAnalysts are watching to see if further erosion occurs following congressional testimony Tuesday by Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who said the number of lung illnesses could soon climb by the hundreds.\n\n\u201cThis is a very, very fast-moving issue, and it will likely be a couple more weeks, if not months, before we understand the impact it\u2019s really had on the retail ecosystem and on consumers\u2019 attitudes,\u201d Kagia said.\n\nIn an explosively growing market, \u201cit\u2019s not unexpected that something would come up that would be disruptive,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the question is, how quick is the industry\u2019s response and how agile is that response to assure the public and regulators that this issue is being addressed and there\u2019s robust self-governance?\u201d\n\nDoctors have said the illnesses resemble an inhalation injury, with the lungs apparently reacting to a caustic substance. So far, no single vaping product or ingredient has been linked to the illnesses. Some patients who have vaped only nicotine also have gotten ill.\n\nHealth officials in New York are focusing on vitamin E acetate, a viscous solution that\u2019s sometimes added to marijuana oils. Retailers in some markets are pulling products from their shelves that contain that and other additives. Other companies have proactively released public statements saying their vape oils contain only pure THC.\n\nIn Illinois, a message board for medical marijuana patients banned posters from sharing home vape recipes.\n\n\u201cI just do THC. No flavor additives. I won\u2019t even take that chance,\u201d said Lisa Haywood, a medical marijuana card holder who lives outside Chicago and follows the board for advice and support.\n\nOther medical marijuana users are worried about restrictions on vaping.\n\nIf there\u2019s a ban, \u201cwhat does it do for all these people who have been seeing relief? \u2026 It is going to really impact patients and the industry that we\u2019ve fought\u201d to create, said Melanie Rose Rodgers, a Colorado medical cannabis patient and a leader of the state\u2019s chapter of Americans for Safe Access, which advocates for medical marijuana patients.\n\nState regulators track the cannabis sold to consumers but don\u2019t monitor what additives, if any, are in marijuana oil vapes. That\u2019s led states to begin discussions of how to tighten restrictions on vaping products even as retailers themselves try to determine which of the products on their shelves contain so-called cutting agents.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t evolved our system that far to think about what we would test for in those products. A lot of these additives were conceptual at the time when the (marijuana legalization) law passed and the program came into place,\u201d said Steve Marks, executive director of the Oregon Liquor License Commission, which oversees the state\u2019s cannabis industry.\n\n\u201cFiguring that out is part of the evolution that we have to do as a consumer protection agency,\u201d he said. \u201cScience is not going to guide us because science is lagging.\u201d\n\nHilary Bricken, a Los Angeles-based attorney whose firm specializes in cannabis business law and regulatory issues, said the legal marijuana industry is moving so fast that many states are \u201cliterally making this up as they go,\u201d and the vaping scare has stripped away the sense of security that consumers get from buying from a licensed dispensary.\n\nThe vaping crisis will undoubtedly hasten tighter regulation at the state level and force the industry to patrol itself better to avoid crippling lawsuits, she said.\n\nBobby Burleson, an analyst with Toronto-based investment and financial services company Canaccord Genuity, said the initial problems for the vape segment of the cannabis industry should moderate, and the health scare may in the end help the legal marijuana industry.\n\nThe crisis \u201cshould ultimately accelerate the shift away from the black market for cannabis products in the U.S.,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nFlaccus and Peltz, who reported from New York City, are members of AP\u2019s marijuana beat team.
