REUTERS/Francois Lenoir\n\nVestager is staying on in her job as European Competition Commissioner for another five years and now enjoys additional regulatory power to target the technology industry as part of a broader role ensuring Europe is fit for the digital age.\n\nCalls from critics and politicians to break up tech giants accused of abusing their position to squash competitors have intensified in recent months, especially in the United States.\n\nVestager, a former Danish economics minister, has gained a reputation as a tough enforcer, notably with a record fine totaling more than 8 billion euros ($8.8 billion) on Alphabet unit Google (GOOGL.O) for throttling rivals.\n\nAsked if she would consider breaking up companies that violate rules, Vestager told her confirmation hearing at the European Parliament that it was not her favored option.\n\n\u201cBreaking up companies, well, this is a tool that we have available, it can be done. The thing is I have obligation to use the least intrusive tool in order to restore fair competition,\u201d she told lawmakers in a packed chamber.\n\n\u201cSince it is quite a thing to break up a company, obviously I have an obligation to try what else can be a good tool to solve the situation that we are in,\u201d she said.\n\nVestager has in the past years handed out hefty fines as well as ordered companies to change their business practices.\n\nShe is expected to order U.S. chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO.O) to suspend some business practices until she completes her investigation into potential anti-competitive business practices, according to a source.\n\nAt the hearing, she said such interim measures had benefits.\n\n\u201cWe find it a high priority to speed up what we do,\u201d she said.\n\nAn interim measure against Broadcom expected in the coming weeks would be the European Commission\u2019s first in almost two decades. It bans certain activities until the regulator completes its years-long investigations and could pave the way for similar action against other tech companies.\n\nVestager also dismissed concerns of conflicts between her enforcer and new regulatory role, saying Commission decisions were taken jointly by commissioners and reinforced by independent advice from the EU executive\u2019s lawyers and economists.\n\nThe Commission as a whole requires EU lawmakers\u2019 approval before taking office in November.", "description": "Europe's antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said on Tuesday she preferred to use fines or other penalties on rule-busting companies rather than break them up, saying this approach would be less disruptive to the companies and the market.", "authors": ["Foo Yun Chee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438480674&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9713N", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
