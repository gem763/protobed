As Robert Fayle, research director, applications, at Info-Tech Research Group said, \u201cWith the increasing adoption of SaaS for ERP, we are seeing a growing interest in integration of third-party products. The era of the comprehensive ERP is coming to an end as companies start connecting products to produce a custom solution.\u201d\n\nAbout the Emotional Footprint Diamond and Emotional Footprint Awards\n\nThe Emotional Footprint Diamond illustrates the customer experience with software vendors, showing a complex relationship spanning procurement, implementation, service and support. The Net Emotional Footprint of a vendor is a result of aggregated emotional response ratings in the areas of service, negotiation, product impact, conflict resolution, and strategy and innovation, creating a powerful indicator of overall user feeling toward the vendor and its product from the software users\u2019 point of view. The data published in the Emotional Footprint Diamond is collected from real end users through authentic software review surveys and meticulously verified for veracity. The survey uses standard net promoter scoring (positive percentage minus negative percentage) to arrive at the Net Emotional Footprint score. These skillfully crafted survey questions are informed by two decades of IT research and advisory.\n\nVendors with top user scores receive the Emotional Footprint Award. The Emotional Footprint Awards, an initiative proudly founded in 100% user-review data, is free of traditional components such as market presence and analyst opinion, which are opaque in nature and may be influenced by vendor pressure, financial or otherwise.\n\nAbout SoftwareReviews\n\nSoftwareReviews is a division of Info-Tech Research Group, a world-class IT research and consulting firm established in 1997.
