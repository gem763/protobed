She was the first woman to compete on the Iranian math Olympiad team and the first to achieve a perfect score. She was also the first woman \u2014 and the first Iranian \u2014 to win the \"Nobel Prize\" of mathematics, the Fields Medal in 2014.\n\nLike the mathematics she studied, Mirzakhani was complicated and complex. Her untimely death has led people to wonder what other astonishing things the gifted mathematician could have achieved.\n\nBorn in Iran, Mirzakhani didn't start out particularly interested in mathematics.\n\n\"I was more excited about reading novels and I thought I would become a writer one day,\" Mirzakhani once told the Simons Foundation in an interview.\n\n\"I got excited about (math) just as a challenge, but then I realized that it's really nice and I enjoy it.\"\n\nMirzakhani credited good schools, caring teachers, and supportive mentors for her success.\n\nMaking sense of 'clever' math\n\nWhen she was in high school Mirzakhani went on to join the Iranian Mathematics Olympiad team. At the time, one of her mentors, Kasra Rafi, now a professor at the University of Toronto, was an undergraduate. Rafi recalls an unforgettable moment with Mirzakhani that happened early on in a study session.\n\n\"As a high school student you are not supposed to know advanced mathematics. I gave them some problems and she came to me with a solution that she had written down. I tried to read the solution and I couldn't understand what was going on,\" Rafi told IDEAS.\n\n\"I mean, I can see that it's mathematics. I can see that it has some logic to it and it's complex analysis and I can follow it. [But] I'm thinking there's no way this makes sense.\"\n\nMaryam Mirzakhani (bottom left) and the Iran Math Olympiad team at York University in 1995. She was 18-years-old and won gold with a perfect score of 42. (Submitted by Keivan Mallahi Karai)\n\nRafi realized he had to first learn the math Maryam was using before he could evaluate her answer, which turned out not only to be correct but \"extremely clever.\"\n\nWhen he spoke to Maryam about her solution, she said she didn't quite understand all the math involved but she had read several math papers that described the same sort of problem.\n\n\"I was very impressed and I was very surprised,\" Kasra said with a laugh.\n\nA Google search of 'famous Persian mathematicians\" lists Maryam Mirzakhani as the only woman among a list of men. (Google Images)\n\nFast forward many years to 2004, when she completed her Ph.D at Harvard University and began teaching at Princeton University. By this time, Mirzakhani had already made a name for herself among mathematicians and accepted a position as a mathematics professor at Stanford University.\n\nHer colleagues cited her quick thinking and complex analyses as attributes that set her apart in a field where slower paced thinking is often the norm. She was also known for her style of writing that many people in the mathematics field describe simply as beautiful.\n\nMaryam Mirzakhani became a full-time professor at the age of 31 \u2060\u2014 one of the youngest ever in the history of \u2060Stanford University. (Simons Foundation in partnership with IMU (International Mathematical Union))\n\nCaroline Series, an emeritus professor of mathematics in Warwick, UK, says Maryam's math stood out for its creativity and simplicity.\n\n\"She doesn't waste energy, and on every half page there'll be some other new point that she just so cleverly turns around,\" said Series.\n\n\"She looks at things from many different angles and each angle will tell her something and at the end she says, poof! And something is true.\"\n\nA legacy of infinite inspiration\n\nBy the time Mirzakhani accepted her Fields Medal in 2014, she was already quite ill. Cancer had taken its toll on both her health and energy. She made it to the ceremony, but was not able to give a speech. Organizers also shielded Maryam from the media, giving her a chance to make her exit from the proceedings quietly.\n\nThe front pages of Iranian newspapers bearing portraits of the top female scientist Maryam Mirzakhani, who died of cancer at the age of 40.

And then we heard that she had cancelled conferences. I heard that she had a relapse.\"\n\nUltimately, she says, Maryam's story was an inspiring one, that she was an immensely talented young woman in a field where women are not common.\n\nBut the news of course also stung: Maryam was leaving behind a young daughter.\n\n\"The whole women mathematical community felt touched by it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGuests in this episode:\n\nKasra Rafi is from Iran and a professor and associate chair (Graduate Studies) in the department of mathematics at the University of Toronto.
