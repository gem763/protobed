Morgan Asset Management.\n\n\"In the very near-term, we may also see a pick-up in safe-havens,\" he added.\n\n\"Central banks are likely to look through the inflationary impact of higher oil prices but the added geopolitical risk to an already fragile backdrop will not go without notice.\"\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.36% after data showed China's industrial production growth skidding to its weakest pace in 17-1/2 years in August.\n\nPainting a dour picture of the world's second-biggest economy, China's statistics bureau said the country faces increasing downward pressure from external uncertainties.\n\nChina's blue-chip index eased 0.2% while Hong Kong's faltered about 1%.\n\nLiquidity was relatively thin with Japanese markets shut for a public holiday.\n\nE-Mini futures for the S&P 500 were off 0.5% while those for the fell 0.4%.\n\nBONDS AND CURRENCIES\n\nIn currency markets, the Saudi news pushed the yen up 0.2% to 107.85 per dollar while the Canadian dollar rose 0.4% in anticipation of higher oil prices.\n\n\"If risk appetite collapses due to fears of worsening Middle East tensions in the wake of any retaliation to the ... attacks, some emerging markets could face a double whammy of pressures,\" said Mitul Kotecha, Singapore-based senior emerging markets strategist at TD Securities.\n\nHe noted that the Indian rupee, Indonesian rupiah and Philippine peso were the Asian currencies most sensitive to oil shocks, given their economies' dependence on crude imports.\n\nIndonesian stocks opened 2% lower on Monday, marking their biggest intraday drop since Aug.6.\n\nThe euro was little moved near a three-week top while the pound stepped back from Friday's two-month highs. That left the greenback down 0.1% at 98.126 against a basket of six major currencies.\n\nThe Australian dollar, a major risk proxy, fell 0.5% against the yen, snapping nine straight days of gains. The dollar slipped to a one-week low on the yen.\n\n\"One immediate question this (attack) poses for bond markets is whether a further rise in the inflation expectations component of bond yields - which have proved historically sensitive to oil prices - will give this month's sharp bond market sell-off fresh impetus,\" said NAB analyst Ray Attrill.\n\n\"Or will safe-haven considerations dominate to drive yields lower?\"\n\nFutures for U.S. rose 0.3%, indicating yields may slip when cash trading begins.\n\nGlobal bonds were sold off last week, sending yields higher, led by a broader risk rally on hopes the United States and China would soon end their long trade war. Better-than-expected U.S. retail sales data also boosted sentiment.\n\nInvestors now await the outcome of the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy meeting on Wednesday at which it is widely expected to ease interest rates and signal its future policy path.\n\n\"The markets will look to the Fed as a key pillar of support and that will increasingly be in focus for global markets as the week goes on,\" JPMorgan's Craig added.", "description": "Oil soars after Saudi facility attacks, weak China data hits shares", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8E0SG_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
