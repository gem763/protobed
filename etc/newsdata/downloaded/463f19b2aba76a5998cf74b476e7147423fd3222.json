He then began to search lenders' mortgage rates online.\n\n'After searching lenders' mortgage rates online, I was surprised by how low some of the rates were,' he said.\n\nMr Conrad described the process of changing lenders as 'easy' and a 'breeze'.\n\nSwitching your mortgage away from the big four banks in the wake of the Reserve Bank of Australia interest cuts could save you nearly $150,000 (stock image)\n\nResearch director at RateCity Sally Tindall said: 'Variable-rate customers have a right to feel ripped off if their bank is choosing not to pass this rate cut on in full.'\n\n'While banks are well within their rights to make a profit and a strong banking sector is vital for our economy, you have right to move your loan to another lender with a sharper rate.'\n\nAustralia's major banks are earning an extra $14bn a year after failing to pass on a quarter of RBA cuts since 2011 and reducing term deposit interest rates in excess of official cash rate reductions, The Australian reported.\n\nAn analysis by RateCity found the standard variable rates have fallen by just 2.99 per cent since October 2011. The RBA reduced the cash rate by four per cent during the same time period.\n\nThe big banks have a 4.05 per cent margin over the cash rate on average standard variable home loans, according to the analysis.", "description": "The RBA announced last week it would cut the cash rate to a record-low of 0.75 per cent, reducing the cost of borrowing for the third time in just four months.", "authors": ["Zoe Zaczek For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/00/19375666-0-image-a-16_1570405978014.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
