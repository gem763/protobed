If you want to spend a bit less, you might go for the Apple Watch Series 3, which has many of the same features as the Series 5, like Apple Pay, GPS, and more.\n\nHow much you'll pay depends on which watch you choose, how you customize the watch in the new Apple Watch Studio, and what country you're in. Both versions are available with either just GPS, or GPS and a cellular connection, so the watch can connect to a cell network without needing to be near a phone.\n\nThe prices vary widely even among the base version of these models, from relatively low prices in the US and Canada to much higher prices in Brazil and Russia. Not all models available in the US are available in other countries.\n\nHere's how much the base model Apple Watches cost in 15 countries.", "description": "Apple now only carries the Series 3 and Series 5 Watches, and they range from least expensive in the US and Canada to most expensive in Brazil.", "authors": ["Mary Meisenzahl"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d82a9642e22af122e307c47-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
