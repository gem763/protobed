Users won't be able to choose which sites can play Flash content automatically and will need to activate it for each site on each visit.\n\nThis version removes the 'Always Activate' option for Flash content. \"Firefox will now always ask for user permission before activating Flash content on a website,\" Mozilla says in its release notes.\n\nMozilla started making its Enhanced Tracking Protection \u2013 a blocker on invasive third-party scripts \u2013 on by default in June, but that was limited to new users. The feature was in Firefox with the release of version 63, last October. In Firefox 69 it will be on by default.\n\n\"Currently over 20% of Firefox users have Enhanced Tracking Protection on. With today's release, we expect to provide protection for 100% of ours users by default,\" said Marissa Wood, vice president of product at Mozilla.\n\nUsers will see a purple shield icon in the address bar when Enhanced Tracking Prevention is working.\n\nMozilla has fleshed out an anti-tracking policy, recently outlining the types of tracking it will target with the system. It wants to curb techniques that are used to build profiles of a user's browsing activity.\n\nThe enhancements to tracking protection mean that by default the 'Standard' setting will block third-party tracking cookies and crypto miners.\n\nThe optional 'Strict' setting also blocks fingerprinting techniques in addition to things it blocks in 'Standard' mode, including known trackers compiled by Disconnect.me, third-party tracking cookies, and cryptominers.\n\nMozilla is also developing an Enhanced Tracking Protection Report, which displays a bar chart of the types of trackers and how many of them it's blocked over the past week. The new report appears to be arriving in Firefox 70.\n\nFirefox 69 is also getting a new option to block any video that automatically starts playing, even the ones that don't play with sound.\n\nUsers with the en-US Firefox will see a new 'New Tab' experience that pushes more curated content from Mozilla-owned Pocket.\n\nAnd Windows 10 users on the May 2019 Update should see more passwordless options, thanks to Firefox's support of the WebAuthn HmacSecret extension via Windows Hello.\n\nFirefox on Windows 10 should start to offer hints for setting appropriate content process priority levels. These settings will optimize processor time to focus on current tasks rather than background tasks. Existing Firefox users will be able to launch Firefox faster now with a new shortcut on the Windows 10 taskbar.\n\nMozilla has some big battery saving plans for macOS users in the pipeline, but Firefox 69 will also deliver some benefits too.\n\n\"macOS users on dual-graphics-card machines (like MacBook Pro) will switch back to the low-power GPU more aggressively, saving battery life,\" Mozilla notes.\n\nAdditionally Finder on macOS now displays a download progress for files being downloaded.\n\nMozilla hasn't disclosed security fixes for this release yet, but notes it addresses multiple vulnerabilities.\n\nMore on Mozilla's Firefox", "description": "Firefox 69 brings its Enhanced Tracking Protection to all 100 million Firefox users.", "authors": ["Liam Tung"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/07/05/44d601fd-7c41-4f28-a16c-c3c74b099c42/thumbnail/770x578/a5a56fde0b90c04d8fc563127791bd92/mozilla-firefox-headquarters-hero1.jpg"}
