According to TMZ, the pair primed their guests with a carnival-themed Sunday extravaganza with a dance party, bowling, and capture the flag. Then the Biebers screened Nick Cassavetes\u2019s 2004 romance The Notebook, because it\u2019s good to remind everyone that marriage is much more than a 1am water gun fight with your dear friends Kendall Jenner and Jaden Smith. It\u2019s also about faithfully visiting your dementia-stricken spouse in the hospital every day for the rest of your life. Hopefully their guests also got a Super Soaker on Monday, to rehydrate from all that sobbing the Biebers made them do ahead of the actual ceremony.", "description": "Justin Bieber and Hailey Bieber screen The Notebook for their wedding guests ahead of their Monday, September 30 wedding in South Carolina.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/30-Justin-Bieber-Hailey-Baldwin.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
