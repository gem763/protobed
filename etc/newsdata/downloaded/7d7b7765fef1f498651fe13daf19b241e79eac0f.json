(David Paul Morris/Bloomberg)\n\nPeloton found its niche making souped-up cycles and treadmills with touch screens that can live-stream fitness classes for a monthly fee. But it doesn\u2019t view itself as a fitness company, regulatory filings show. Rather, it\u2019s a tech, media, software, retail, apparel and \u201csocial connection\u201d company.\n\nWhichever label it wears, its public offering Thursday follows a familiar checklist on this year\u2019s IPO circuit: big name, explosive growth, massive losses.\n\nPeloton began trading Thursday at $27 a share \u2014 nearly 7 percent less than it was priced. The company was shooting for $29 \u2014 the high end of its range.\n\n[Perspective: 2019 shaping up as the year of the fad IPO]\n\nPeloton\u2019s public debut marks a first for fitness-tech companies, analysts say, and comes amid a string of underachieving unicorn IPOs. Uber and Lyft have seen their share prices fall 30 percent or more since going public.\n\nPeloton says it has sold 577,000 machines, nearly all of them in the U.S., and has 1.4 million members who pay a monthly fee. Though revenue surged past $900 million in fiscal 2019, it has amassed more than $500 million in losses since its launch in 2012.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at Peloton, given the subscription models and what\u2019s realized by many as the \u2018Netflix of fitness,\u2019 it\u2019s one that is important for the IPO market to see how this performs,\u201d said Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. \u201cRight now with business models like these, there needs to be a path to profitability.\u201d\n\nPeloton has minted a kind of cult following, thanks to the convenience of logging into a group exercise class from a home, office and anywhere else. Live and on-demand instructors yell at riders to keep pushing, their playlists blaring in the background. The classes, in turn, take out many of the physical and mental hurdles of working out alone or at home \u2014 and strip away the need to get to an actual gym or studio.\n\n[Embattled WeWork co-founder and CEO Adam Neumann will step down, company says]\n\n(Peloton also has paid out $50 million in royalties for its music, TechCrunch reported, and is up against at least $300 million in lawsuits for copyright infringement.)\n\nOn Thursday morning, Peloton co-founder and chief executive John Foley said on CNBC that he expects the company to be profitable by 2023. And he characterized Peloton\u2019s current approach as \u201cdisciplined investing.\u201d The company is currently pushing to grow its treadmill business and expand in Europe, Foley said.\n\n\u201cWe are in investment mode,\u201d Foley told CNBC. \u201cWe are prioritizing growth over profitability right now.\u201d\n\nIn filing for its IPO, Peloton dubbed itself as a tech, media, software, retail and apparel company, as well as one that fosters social connections. Foley recently said that \u201cPeloton sells happiness.\u201d\n\n[Adam Neumann\u2019s chaotic energy built WeWork. Now it might cost him his job as CEO.]\n\nIn another CNBC interview, this one conducted on a Peloton bike, Foley said that the company aims to get the price of its machines down to \u201cmake sure that tens of millions of people around the globe\u201d can afford the equipment. The bikes currently cost roughly $2,000, and the treadmills come with a ticket price of roughly $4,000. Users also have to pay for monthly subscriptions, which come in around $20 or $40, depending on the plan.\n\nConcerns about a possible recession are also behind Peloton\u2019s thinking, Foley said, in addition to how other IPOs have performed in 2019.\n\n\u201cInvestors are going to have to sharpen their own pencils and figure out how to value us on their own,\u201d Foley told CNBC.\n\nFor now, Ives said the IPO could use \u201csome good news.\"\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a healthy appetite for a strong business model,\u201d he said, \u201cand subscription-revenue generated companies that fit the bill.\u201d", "description": "The company, which began trading Thursday at $27 a share, has developed a cult following for its souped-up bikes and treadmills.", "authors": ["Rachel Siegel", "National Business Reporter", "September At Pm", "Rachel Siegel Is A National Business Reporter.
