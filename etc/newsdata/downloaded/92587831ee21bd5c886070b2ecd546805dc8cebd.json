Russia annexed Ukraine\u2019s Crimea region in March 2014.\n\nSome Democrats had questioned whether the administration had withheld the money to put pressure on Ukraine\u2019s government to support Trump\u2019s re-election campaign by launching an investigation into one of Trump\u2019s main rivals in the 2020 U.S. election.\n\nRepublican and Democratic members of the Senate Appropriations Committee said the White House released the money on Wednesday night, hours before the panel was due to debate an amendment to a defense spending bill that would have prevented Trump from such actions in the future.\n\nAn administration official confirmed that the money had been released, providing no explanation. The White House had said only that it was reviewing the Ukraine aid program.\n\nSenate Republican leader Mitch McConnell praised the Trump administration\u2019s release of the funds, saying: \u201cIt would have been a mistake to hold back our assistance to the brave people of Ukraine. Doing so would have undermined our partners in Ukraine and Eastern Europe and further emboldened the Kremlin.\u201d\n\nIt was one of several disputes recently between Trump and members of Congress, including some of his fellow Republicans as well as Democrats, over his administration\u2019s decision to sidestep congressional approval to fund its own policy initiatives.\n\nLawmakers from both parties had said they expected Congress would pass legislation to reinstate the aid for Ukraine if the administration had not released the money.\n\nThe White House has sought repeatedly to slash foreign aid since Trump took office in January 2017, but Congress has pushed back against such plans.\n\nThis week, three national security committees in the Democratic-led House of Representatives announced that they were launching an investigation into whether Trump, his lawyer Rudy Giuliani and possibly others had been trying to put pressure on Ukraine\u2019s government to assist in Trump\u2019s re-election campaign.\n\nThe committees had said they would investigate whether withholding the military aid was part of Trump\u2019s effort \u201cto coerce\u201d the Kiev government into launching an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden and his family.\n\nBiden is running against Trump in the 2020 presidential campaign.", "description": "President Donald Trump's administration has released $250 million in military aid for Ukraine, U.S. senators said on Thursday, after lawmakers from both parties expressed concern that the White House had held up money approved by Congress.", "authors": ["Patricia Zengerle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429161257&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B1TD", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
