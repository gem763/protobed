That launch earned about half the search interest of the blockbuster iPhone 6 event two years prior. (Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP)\n\nApple is expected to announce the latest version of the iPhone on Tuesday in what has become an annual Silicon Valley ritual watched closely by the technology industry and gadget lovers. But there\u2019s just one question: Who will buy it?\n\nApple\u2019s customers, many of whom once lined up outside the company\u2019s stores to purchase its newest phone the day they became available, now wait an average of three years to upgrade, unenthused by Apple\u2019s new offerings, analysts say.\n\n[Your Apple products are getting more expensive. Here\u2019s how they get away with it.]\n\nApple sold more of its two-year-old iPhone 8 in the second quarter of 2019 than it did its year-old $1,000 flagship iPhone XS, according to Strategy Analytics. According to research firm Sensor Tower, more than 75 percent of the iPhones in use today are models that were released at least two years ago and that have a home button, which Apple replaced with Face ID on its top-of-the-line phone in 2017.\n\nNothing makes the iPhone\u2019s slide from the zeitgeist clearer than interest in Apple\u2019s launch events. Google searches for iPhones once doubled as hype for the new models peaked each fall, but last year\u2019s launch barely moved the needle. The iPhone 4 and 6, which debuted in 2012 and 2014 respectively, each inspired roughly four times as many searches as last September\u2019s iPhone XS, XR and XS Max combined, The Washington Post's analysis of Google search data shows.\n\nMike Bostock, a 40-year-old start-up founder in San Francisco, remembers waiting in line to buy the very first iPhone the day it came out. Approached outside an Apple store in San Francisco, he said these days, he upgrades his phone every couple of years, but without the joy he used to have. \u201cI don\u2019t get excited about new phones coming out,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s not just Apple. The global smartphone industry is slowing, as the market is already saturated and new models offer only slight improvements. Major innovations, such as folding phones or new mobile devices such as augmented-reality glasses, are still a ways off from becoming mainstream gadgets. (Samsung\u2019s delayed Galaxy Fold is due to launch this month, priced at nearly $2,000.)\n\nBut no major technology company is defined by the smartphone quite like Apple, which set the industry standard when it launched the first iPhone in 2007. Accounting for 56 percent of Apple\u2019s overall revenue in the first three quarters of this financial year, the iPhone turned Apple into one of the most valuable companies in the world. Samsung, by contrast, has a more diversified business, selling everything from microprocessors to television sets. And Google, which makes the most popular mobile operating system, Android, still earns the bulk of its money from search ads.\n\n[Apple preaches privacy. Lawmakers want the talk to turn to action.]\n\nOne silver lining for Apple is that its customers, despite their lack of interest in buying the company\u2019s new devices, are not leaving in any significant numbers for Android, the only major competitor to Apple\u2019s iOS operating system. On a July earnings call with analysts, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company\u2019s \u201cinstalled base,\u201d or the number of people using Apple devices, reached an all-time high, with more than 1.4 billion users worldwide.\n\nApple spokeswoman Trudy Muller declined to comment.\n\n\u201cApple since 2017 has maybe put more effort into profit margins than delivering good phones to consumers,\u201d said Strategy Analytics analyst Linda Sui. She estimates Apple will sell fewer phones this year than it did last year. After sales of iPhones began to slump, dropping 15 percent in one quarter last year, Apple stopped disclosing to investors how many phones it sells.\n\n[How Apple uses its App Store to copy the best ideas]\n\nBostock, chief technology officer of a data visualization company called Observable, thinks Apple has made a few questionable design decisions, from the way the iPhone\u2019s camera protrudes awkwardly from the phone\u2019s body to the Face ID system that is convenient but sometimes requires him to hunch over his phone to unlock it.\n\nThere are several reasons for Apple customers\u2019 waning interest in its newest phones, analysts say. For one, Apple has been slow to add new features like fingerprint sensors built into the phone\u2019s screen, which Samsung offers, or advanced cameras that can take high-quality pictures in low light and zoom in on far away subjects.\n\nApple has also suffered from a dearth of new \u201ckiller apps\u201d that drive customers to upgrade their hardware. Smartphone users spend more of their time on the same old apps like YouTube, Instagram and Netflix, none of which require a particularly advanced phone to operate. Despite Apple\u2019s push into services, it has been slow to offer the kinds of artificial intelligence enhancements that Google has built into its Android operating system, such as Google Assistant. Most of Google\u2019s services are also available on the iPhone.\n\n[Apple unveils new services and privacy tools at its developer event]\n\nApple\u2019s new phone is also not expected to include the latest wireless standard, 5G, which is already available on a handful of high-end smartphones, like the Galaxy S10 5G and other models from Huawei, LG and Motorola. Apple has been slow to develop 5G, in part because of a dispute with Qualcomm, which makes the most advanced 5G modems, over licensing fees.\n\nHardware analyst Patrick Moorhead, at the firm Moor Insights & Strategy, said he believes Apple has come to rely on the fact that its customers won\u2019t leave Apple even if it\u2019s slow to innovate. \u201cI think Apple is comfortable and doesn\u2019t feel the need to take risks,\u201d he said. But he warned against Apple depending on the lock-in effect. \u201cIt can work in the short term, but it never works in the long term,\u201d he said.\n\nMoorhead noted that in Europe, where Apple services such as iMessage and the Photos app are less popular, only about 20 percent of the population uses iPhones. In the United States, where consumers feel more tied to Apple services, that number is closer to 50 percent. Moorhead said he estimates that if consumers were less locked into Apple by its proprietary apps, Apple\u2019s market share in the U.S. would drop to somewhere near 30 percent.\n\nAt a cost of about $1,000 for the latest flagship model, iPhones have become so expensive that they can be a financial burden for customers.\n\nCraig Jaworski, a 29-year-old content marketer in Columbia, Mo., said he\u2019s sticking with his iPhone 7, no matter what Apple announces on Tuesday. After years of regularly upgrading his phones, sometimes multiple times a year, he\u2019s decided having the latest one isn\u2019t worth the monthly payments to service his phone loan. When it\u2019s time to upgrade, he says he plans to save up and buy a used phone. But he doesn\u2019t know when that will be. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been anything that has seemed like a must-have,\u201d he says.\n\nBut Moorhead said it\u2019s not all doom and gloom for Apple. Its success will rely on breaking into new categories, such as augmented-reality glasses, which Apple has long been rumored to be working on. That device would essentially turn a person\u2019s eyewear into a transparent computer screen, overlaying things like turn-by-turn directions atop the real world, or showing a constant stream of social media posts throughout the day.\n\nApple CarPlay is another opportunity, he said. As driving becomes more automated, allowing people to tune out on the highway, for instance, the car could become like a second living room, and Apple could become the operating system for automobile entertainment.\n\nAnother challenge for Apple in upgrading its phones is its sheer size. While Apple ranks behind Samsung and Huawei in overall phone sales, Apple sells fewer models and concentrates only on the high end of the market. Samsung and Huawei don\u2019t have to make as many of their flagship phones, giving them more flexibility in how quickly they adopt new features.\n\nFor instance, Apple\u2019s latest line of phones, the XR, XS and XS Max, sold 26 million phones in the second quarter of 2019. By comparison, Samsung\u2019s S10 and S10 Plus sold only 7 million units in the same period, according to Strategy Analytics.\n\nBut Apple has also expanded its product line, coupled by new naming conventions that break from sequential numbers \u2014 and Apple is expected to switch from the most recent X branding with this year\u2019s models. Google searches for specific iPhone model numbers have dropped more steeply than general iPhone searches, suggesting that consumers are still interested in iPhones even if they can\u2019t remember which model was unveiled onstage.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean customers are necessarily happy about sticking with Apple. Some people say they\u2019re trapped in Apple\u2019s ecosystem. Jeremy Kirkland, the 34-year-old host of the podcast \u201cBlamo!,\u201d says he once bought every new iPhone the day it was released. But a year ago, as he watched Apple\u2019s live webcast of its new phone announcement for the updated X line, he observed they offered only incremental new features. \u201cThere was just nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cI was like okay, I\u2019m not doing this.\u201d\n\nKirkland waited for Google to release its Pixel 3 phone later that year and he traded in his iPhone X. He loved how pictures of his 2-year-old daughter taken with Pixel\u2019s more advanced camera looked and he enjoyed Google\u2019s software features, such as the \u201cassistant\u201d that can predict where you\u2019re going and remind you to leave on time. \u201cThe Pixel is fire, man. Everything about that phone was great.\u201d\n\nBut then reality set in. First, Kirkland noticed his Apple AirPods didn\u2019t work as well with the Pixel. Then came the complaints from his family members, who all used iPhones. They couldn\u2019t use FaceTime, Apple\u2019s built-in video-call feature, to speak with Kirkland\u2019s daughter. Photos didn\u2019t look as nice because they were sent via SMS, instead of Apple\u2019s proprietary iMessage service. And he couldn\u2019t upload to Apple\u2019s photo app anymore because that app is available only on iPhone.\n\nKirkland tried to persuade his family members to switch to Android, to no avail. So he gave up and sold his Pixel, paying nearly $1,500 for the iPhone XS Max. \u201cSure, they\u2019re getting the most amount of money out of me all the time,\u201d he says. \u201cBut am I a happier consumer? No.\u201d\n\nDiscover something new:\n\nWe\u2019ve curated these stories to inspire your curiosity.\n\nUnderstanding the human cost of your smartphone\n\nThe world has grown reliant on lithium-ion batteries, but the desperate search for the ingredients carries a steep cost.\n\nThe debate over how to provide affordable urban housing\n\nD.C. housed the homeless in upscale apartments.
