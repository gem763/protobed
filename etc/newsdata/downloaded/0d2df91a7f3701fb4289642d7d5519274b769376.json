She was found submerged under the water when her partner went to check on her.\n\nTests showed Ms O'Dwyer had traces of fluoxetine, paracetamol, beta blockers, amitriptyline, zopiclone, citalopram and propanol in her system and would have been more than twice the alcohol limit for driving. She did not drown but died from being immersed in the water due to the toxic mixture of tablets and alcohol in her system.\n\nThe Bolton hearing was told Ms O'Dwyer, a divorcee from Wigan, Greater Manchester had been regarded as one of the world's leading emergency and critical care veterinary nurses and was described as an 'inspiration' to other vets. She wrote 45 practical guide books and journal papers and had had won several awards for her contribution to the industry.\n\nHer sister Alison Bradshaw said: 'She was very intelligent and very successful and well respected all over the world. Professionally and personally, everyone knew her and she appeared to be very happy. She worked hard lecturing and writing and had friends all over the world.\n\nThe Bolton hearing heard how Ms O'Dwyer had been regarded as one of the world's leading emergency and critical care veterinary nurses and was described as an 'inspiration' to other vets. She wrote 45 practical guide books and journal papers and had had won several awards for her contribution to the industry\n\n'But she started losing a lot of weight and from April 2015 she started experiencing anxiety and depression. I was confused to learn about her taking days of work, that wasn't like Louise. Sometimes she would say she didn't want to go into work and I was concerned about that as that wasn't Louise. She mentioned having a panic attack whilst giving a lecture and this was totally out of character.\n\n'She had been lecturing for years all over the world. She didn't say what triggered the panic attack but it was a trigger for her anxiety.'\n\nMs O'Dwyer was prescribed antidepressants by her GP and later sleeping tablets. She made an appointment for counselling with a mental health team but then began making plans to lecture in Queensland, Australia.\n\nMiss Bradshaw said: 'The week before she died she was messaging about a hotel she was booking for a trip to Ireland where she was lecturing on that holiday. She was talking about delivery of a new bed but the family noticed she seemed to be drinking more alcohol.\n\n'I spoke to her about how drinking alcohol will make her feel depressed or anxious and she told my dad she was taking sleeping tablets and I was concerned. I last spoke to her on the Thursday before she died. We were sending messages to each other. The last text message was talking about how she was deciding to put her Masters on hold to release the pressure off her a bit.\n\n'I asked if she needed to keep working and she said she wanted to be independent. I never had any inclination she wanted to harm herself.'\n\nMs O'Dwyer was prescribed antidepressants by her GP and later sleeping tablets. Ms O'Dwyer's partner Paul Rogerson told the hearing how Ms O'Dwyer was complaining of nausea, dizziness and drowsiness and she said taking more baths relaxed the side effects of her medication\n\nMs O'Dwyer's partner Paul Rogerson told the hearing: ' Louise had some insecurities but she continued with her studies and lectures and didn't have any problems with her job. In 2019 she became behind with projects for her Masters and put it on hold.\n\n'Louise never spoke to me about her panic attack but she became depressed and had problems sleeping. In the short period of time leading up to her death she was having regular baths as she said it helped her to better deal with the side effects of the drugs as she was suffering so badly.\n\n'She was complaining of nausea, dizziness and drowsiness and she said taking more baths relaxed the side effects. Louise was drinking and she liked to have a drink in the bath. On the night before she died we spent the evening together and we were drinking wine and went to bed.\n\n'The next day, Louise said she was going to have a bath and took a drink upstairs with her. When the football finished I went into the bathroom to see her and that's where I found her. The glass was partially full with gin in it.\n\n'She used to say 'I'm going to get better, I promise'. Some of the medication was mine from blister packs. They were kept in a drawer and she had access to them. I think she was just trying to cope and get through the days but I had no concerns she might harm herself.'\n\nOn May 5 this year, after drinking wine and gin with her partner Ms O'Dwyer took sleeping tablets and other medication as a 'coping mechanism' before falling asleep as she took a bath. She was found submerged under the water when her partner went to check on her\n\nMajor Alan Taberner a former army medical officer works as a senior practitioner for the mental health team treated Ms O'Dwyer.\n\n'If she was invited to speak or help, she found it difficult to say no. She told me she had been speaking at a conference in Birmingham and she said the panic attack shocked her. She said it was uncharacteristic of her and she felt like she wanted to escape and wanted to leave.\n\n'This event seemed to shake her confidence. Normally she was quite assertive - I could tell she was a powerful woman. We were thinking of CBT but I believe she was burying her head in the sand. This was very typical behaviour for that way of thinking. It was a case of: 'I must perform my best all the time, and if I don't it's a flaw.' We all have flaws but she saw herself as a perfectionist.\n\n'I thought it was appropriate for our team to work with Louise and she was up for that. She never talked about having baths as her coping mechanism but I believe she was suffering with burnout,' Taberner said.\n\nTests showed Ms O'Dwyer had 184 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The legal alcohol limit in blood for driving is 80mg.\n\nRecording a verdict of death by misadventure Coroner Alan Walsh said: 'From such a talented young lady to go into what may be said a meltdown in a short period of time is unimaginable. But I want to make it clear. This is not an alcoholic situation, it was more of a coping mechanism'.\n\nHe added: 'She was very intelligent, both academically and practically. She was an author of critical care and intensive care in veterinary science. She was world renowned for her achievements and her ability to teach and lecture.\n\nTests showed Ms O'Dwyer had 184 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The legal alcohol limit in blood for driving is 80mg. Coroner Alan Walsh recorded a verdict of death by misadventure\n\n'She spoke at lectures and meetings. She involved herself in the training to provide future careers. She was a character and somebody who everybody loved to know. It might have been part of her problem as she was the type of person who wanted to contribute so much and she found it very difficult to say no.\n\n'She was somebody who kept up her professional status and work and kept up with her commitments. She decided to put a hold on her masters degree. She was a lady who enjoyed to drinking socially and did not have an alcohol problem.\n\n'She just enjoyed social drinking with friends and family, as we all do. There was nothing out of the ordinary. Mr Taberner possibly got to the source of her problems as she couldn't say no and she suffered burn out, she would not understand that she suffered with burn out.\n\n'Only when she experienced having a panic attack she began to suffer with anxiety and depression, but she didn't suffer with mental illness. She was suffering from burn out as a result of her overcommitment to others. I don't know how she honoured all those commitments and held down a job. I believe she took the medication to try and help her to cope.\n\n'She needed to relax and by having the bath she became drowsy and had gone to sleep, and died from the immersion in the water. She did not intend to end her life. I accept she took the medication on her own volition which might help her to cope and recover. She did not intend her actions to lead to her death.\n\n'To the family - I am extremely sorry for the tragic death of Louise. I am sorry because she achieved so much. I am sorry as she probably so much to give. I believe she would have benefited from the therapy which would have helped her move forward,' Walsh added.\n\nIf you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this article then you can call the Samaritans 24 hour helpline on 116 123.", "description": "Louise O'Dwyer from Wigan had given lectures around the world.
