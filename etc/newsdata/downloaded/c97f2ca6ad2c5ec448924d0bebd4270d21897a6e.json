In it, Trump passed along unverified allegations about Biden and Democrats before asking Zelensky to do him a \u201cfavor\u201d by looking into his political rival.\n\nTrump also tweeted on Sunday that he wanted to meet not only his accuser, \u201cwho presented SECOND & THIRD HAND INFORMATION,\u201d but also the person who gave the whistleblower this information.\n\n\u201cWas this person SPYING on the U.S. President? Big Consequences!\u201d Trump wrote.\n\nThe president also elevated his attack on Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, saying he should be questioned for \u201ctreason\u201d after labeling his actions as \u201cfraud.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis lies were made in perhaps the most blatant and sinister manner ever seen in the great Chamber,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe wrote down and read terrible things, then said it was from the mouth of the President of the United States.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s demand about Schiff comes after a Thursday hearing in which the chairman\u2019s dramatic reading of the call with Zelensky rankled Trump and his allies.\n\nSchiff prefaced the reading by saying, \u201cIn not so many words, this is the essence of what the president communicates.\u201d\n\nHe then paraphrased the conversation: \u201cI hear what you want. I have a favor I want from you, though, and I\u2019m going to say this only seven times, so you better listen good. I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent, understand? Lots of it.\u201d\n\nAfter drawing sharp criticism, Schiff noted that his summary of the call was part parody. \u201cThe fact that that\u2019s not clear is a separate problem in and of itself,\u201d he said.", "description": "President Donald Trump asserted on Sunday that he\u2019s entitled to meet the whistleblower whose complaint has entangled his administration and led to the opening of an official impeachment inquiry.
