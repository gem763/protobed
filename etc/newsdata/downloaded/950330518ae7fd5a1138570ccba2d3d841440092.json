Motorists should not be used as cash cows,' Mr Khoury said.\n\nCouncil CEO Ray Brownlee said the high revenue gained from fines was due to the council being the fourth largest local government area in NSW (file image of Sydney's Northern Beaches)\n\nBut the Northern Beaches Mayor defended the council, saying the fines were going towards helping better the community.\n\nMayor Michael Regan said more than $2million went towards youth and community services while another $5million went to sports facilities.\n\nThe council also said that a staggering $14million had been spent on maintaining roads, footpaths and kerbs during the financial year.\n\nBut data from Your Council showed that the Northern Beaches council had spent half the money of other Sydney areas on roads and bridges between the 2017/2018 financial year.\n\nWithin the area, 900 complaints were lodged due to wheel damage and busted tyres because of 60 reported potholes.", "description": "The Northern Beaches Council handed out over 60,000 fines related to a number of offences and parking infringements were the biggest source of profit within the past financial year.", "authors": ["Eliza Mcphee", "Paula Ahillon For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/08/19477974-0-image-a-2_1570605949395.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
