I have come to realise it's best we stay just friends,\" he said.\n\n\"The last few months have been like a soap opera. Lizzie and I have been the innocent victim of some wild and false accusations.\"\n\nHe went on: \"Life with Lizzie is tremendous fun, but you also have to accept living in a publicity bubble. Even though I come from a showbiz family, I've found that difficult.\n\n(Image: Phil Lewis/WENN.com)\n\n\"Lizzie loves the red-carpet lifestyle and I don't blame her, but it's not really for me. I've been reading in the papers that we are getting married, even having a double-date wedding with Anthea Turner, but we hadn't discussed marriage.\n\n\"It was a crazy world in which nearly every time we dated the photos were in the papers. All that, coupled with a third party who was out to destroy us, made things difficult. I kept my head down and never said a word publicly until now.\n\n\"I was due to attend a film premiere in Marbella with Lizzie last week and I had to pull out for business reasons less than 48 hours beforehand. It would have been our first trip abroad together.\n\n(Image: Internet Unknown)\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\n\"I know she was upset about it and I apologise for that, but for the long term I think it was for the best.\"\n\nJeremy was previously dating Candice Hodge but split from her after two years together.\n\nHe and Lizzie got together at the start of 2019 and went official in April.\n\n\"We got on really well from the word go. We didn't stop laughing for weeks. Our friend told Lizzie before we met 'Jeremy will cheer you up' and I hope I did. She's not only beautiful but great company,\" he added.\n\n\"Lizzie's a super girl who is loads of fun. I wish her all the best for the future and hope we can stay good pals.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nThe split comes just a day after Lizzie weighed in on the war of the WAGs - the Twitter storm with Coleen and Becky at its heart.\n\nSpeaking on Thursday's This Morning, Lizzie said she'd be happy to stage peace talks between the feuding women.\n\n\"I just hope we can sort this out. I think we should sit round a table and get to the bottom of it rather than get all legal and public,\" she said.\n\n\"Coleen is a very honest and lovely girl. She would never have gone and outed someone publicly like this if she didn't have 100% proof.\"", "description": "Lizzie Cundy, who is currently mediating between Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy, has split from her boyfriend of 10 months", "authors": ["Emmeline Saunders", "Image", "Phil Lewis Wenn.Com", "Internet Unknown", "Ken Mckay Itv Rex", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20561172.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Paul-Strank-Charity-Gala.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
