It spread rapidly and flames blocked both exits out of the lower deck, where passengers and one crew member were sleeping in tight quarters, Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said.\n\nThe captain and four crew members awake on the upper decks jumped off the front of the vessel, swam to an inflatable boat at the back and steered it to a ship anchored nearby. Authorities have interviewed them but haven\u2019t said what efforts they made to help the 34 people trapped aboard before abandoning ship.\n\nTwenty bodies have been pulled from the sunken vessel that had been anchored close to the shore of Santa Cruz Island, about 20 miles off the coast and northwest of Los Angeles. Four to six other bodies have been spotted underwater, and divers are looking for the remaining people who are missing.\n\nAmong those believed to be dead are five members of one family and the marine biologist leading the diving tour.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re sensitive to the fact that families have gathered today, some from outside of the area, to bring their loved ones home,\u201d Santa Barbara County Fire Chief Mark Hartwig told reporters. Those families \u201cwill rely on us to do everything in our power to find out happened aboard that vessel in the last moments of these family members\u2019 lives. That\u2019s our commitment.\u201d\n\nDNA will be needed to identify all the victims, and authorities will be using the same rapid analysis tool that identified victims of the deadly wildfire that devastated the Northern California town of Paradise last year, the sheriff said.\n\nAuthorities have not released any victims\u2019 names, but Brown said he had heard anecdotally that they ranged from teenagers to people in their 60s. He said most appear to have been from Northern California, including Santa Cruz, San Jose and the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nSusana Rosas of Stockton, California, posted on social media that her three daughters, their father and stepmother were on board.\n\nKristy Finstad, 41, co-owner of Worldwide Diving Adventures, which chartered the boat, was identified in a Facebook post by her brother, Brett Harmeling of Houston who asked people to pray for her.\n\nPacific Collegiate School in Santa Cruz said some of its students and their parents were on the boat.\n\nThe Coast Guard called off its rescue operation Tuesday after determining there were no more survivors, Capt. Monica Rochester said.\n\nThe 75-foot Conception was on the last day of a three-day excursion to the chain of rugged, wind-swept isles that form Channel Islands National Park in the Pacific Ocean west of Los Angeles. The fire broke out shortly after 3 a.m. Monday as the boat sat anchored in Platt\u2019s Harbor off Santa Cruz Island.\n\nThe sheriff said all 34 victims were trapped on the boat\u2019s lower deck when flames quickly blocked both a narrow stairway and an escape hatch leading to the upper decks.\n\n\u201cThe one crew member who was not rescued appears to have been asleep in the sleeping area down below with the passengers,\u201d Brown said.\n\nIt appears the crew sent multiple mayday calls, including one from the Conception in which a crew member could be heard saying he couldn\u2019t breathe.\n\nA later one came from the fishing vessel The Grape Escape after the crew reached it in their small boat. One of the vessel\u2019s owners said he heard explosions as he watched the Conception go up in flames from about 100 yards away. Brown said the blasts could have been exploding scuba tanks or propane tanks.\n\nInvestigators have received written accounts from the five survivors and would interview them, Brown said. The National Transportation Safety Board, which also is investigating, said they were cooperating.\n\n\u201cI am 100 percent confident that our investigators will determine the cause of this fire, why it occurred, how it occurred and what is needed to prevent it from happening again,\u201d NTSB member Jennifer Homendy told reporters.\n\nThe Conception, based in Santa Barbara Harbor, was owned by Santa Barbara-based Truth Aquatics, founded in 1974. A memorial at the harbor has quickly grown as mourners come to pay their respects.\n\nActor Rob Lowe tweeted that he had been aboard the vessel many times. Dave Reid, who runs an underwater camera manufacturing business with his wife, Terry Schuller, also has traveled on the Conception and two other boats in Truth Aquatics\u2019 fleet and said he considered all three among the best and safest.\n\nSchuller said the company\u2019s crews have always been meticulous in going over safety instructions at the beginning of every trip she\u2019s been on.\n\n\u201cThey tell you where the life jackets are, how to put them on ... the exits, where the fire extinguishers are, on every single trip,\u201d Schuller said.\n\nCoast Guard records show the boat\u2019s owners quickly addressed all safety violations from the last five years.", "description": "Flames roared through a boat of sleeping scuba divers so quickly that it appears none of the 34 people below deck could escape, authorities said Tuesday as...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ616_boatfi_ZG_20190903200443.jpg"}
