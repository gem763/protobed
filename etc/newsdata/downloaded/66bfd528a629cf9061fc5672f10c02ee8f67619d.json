(John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\nColumnist\n\nThe Dodgers are pretty good. No, very good. Okay, they\u2019re just about as wonderful as advertised. As 43,423 witnesses at Nationals Park on Sunday night can attest after watching Los Angeles batter the Nationals, 10-4, in Game 3 of the National League Division Series.\n\nNow, the season comes down to a do-or-die Game 4 on Monday night with Max Scherzer on the mound. If you\u2019re going to go down swinging, at least the Nats are starting a big puncher.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re such a good team. They put pressure on you. You have to ask so much of guys to beat this team,\u201d said reliever Sean Doolittle, capsulizing the Nats\u2019 huge problem, and the lengths they have to go to \u2014 using star starters in relief to stay competitive. \u201cThis game was tough. But it only counts as one. We\u2019re still alive.\u201d\n\nWashington has pulled out every unconventional scale-balancing trick it can to narrow the gap between itself and the back-to-back pennant winners from Los Angeles who won 106 games this season and might have tacked on more if needed. But it may not be enough. The Nats have shown resilience all year. But, right about now, after this thumping, they may feel like they need a bomb shelter.\n\nAfter a seven-run sixth-inning demolition of relievers Patrick Corbin and Wander Suero on Sunday night, turning a 2-1 Washington lead into an 8-2 deficit and eventual defeat, the Dodgers need just one more win to end the Nats\u2019 season.\n\n[Corbin, Nationals get rocked by Dodgers in sixth inning, lose NLDS Game 3, 10-4]\n\nIn such dire straits, the Nats would ideally like to have Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg, who led the NL in wins, lined up on sufficient rest for Game 4 and, if necessary, a Game 5 back in Los Angeles. And it would also be helpful that both Doolittle and Daniel Hudson, the lone trusted relievers, be rested and ready to support them.\n\nAnd what do you know \u2014 all those conditions are now in place!\n\nSo, feel free to continue paying attention. Two-game winning streaks are not unheard of, even against superlative teams.\n\n\u201cFeels like we\u2019ve been here before. We\u2019re comfortable in this spot with our backs against the wall,\u201d said Doolittle who, like Hudson, will be well-rested for Game 4 and Game 5, if necessary. \u201cMax tomorrow. \u2018Stay in the fight,\u2019 as we say around here.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Dodgers will start 39-year-old curveballer Rich Hill in Game 4, one of the game\u2019s grittier big-game competitors, but also a fellow who is often kept intact by bailing wire and surgical tape. This year, between multiple injuries, he pitched only 58 \u2154 innings. Unfortunately for the Nats, when vertical, his ERA was 2.45.\n\n\u201cAll hands on deck tomorrow,\u201d Manager Dave Martinez said. \u201cWe want to go to L.A. again.\u201d\n\nThe Nats will have to overcome more than just Hill. In postseason series, messages are sent, like left hooks to the body that soften up defenses and resistance until that final right cross delivers the darkness of a season\u2019s end.\n\nThe Dodgers sent just such a message to Corbin in that sixth inning of Game 3.\n\nFor a month, the Nats have said that they would use all three of their top starters \u2014 Strasburg, Scherzer and Corbin \u2014 in high-leverage situations in these playoffs.\n\nThree scoreless innings of relief made Strasburg the winner in the wild-card game against the Brewers. Scherzer delivered in Game 2 against the Dodgers, striking out the side in a pivotal eighth inning as a bridge from Doolittle in the seventh to Hudson in the ninth.\n\nCould Corbin, who allowed only one earned run in six innings in Game 1, after issuing four shaky walks in the first inning, continue the trend?\n\n[Svrluga: Bullpen moves in Game 3 were a disaster. That doesn\u2019t mean they were wrong.]\n\nPlayoff teams have tried variations of this ploy in the past, but never with three elite starting pitchers \u2014 combined salaries of $525 million \u2014 all willing and, they say, delighted to step in against the heavily favored Dodgers.\n\nThe third time wasn\u2019t the charm. Perhaps just as damaging, Corbin required 35 pitches to get through two-thirds of that hideous seven-run sixth, so he won\u2019t be available for Game 4 and might only be useful for one hitter, or one inning at most, should there be a Game 5.\n\nNot all seven-run innings are created equal. Some are built on walks, hit-by-pitches, errors, bloops, blunders and luck. Others are constructed around a 100-mph line drive single to right, a hard opposite-field grounder smacked into right, then a pair of scalded passing-birds-beware line-drive doubles up the left field alley. And sometimes such explosions culminate in a three-run home run that enters the visitors\u2019 bullpen like an meteor.\n\nThe Dodgers\u2019 seven-run statement was the latter.\n\nCorbin\u2019s problem, at least the self-inflicted part, was an awful habit of getting ahead in the count 0-2, then nibbling \u2014 or missing badly \u2014 until the Dodgers\u2019 hitters got back in the count.\n\nWhat do the Nationals need to reshape this series? Perhaps because the Nats ended their regular season with eight straight wins, then won their wild-card game, it has been easy to overlook what may be the Nats\u2019 biggest problem in their NL Division Series.\n\nIt\u2019s not the bullpen \u2014 it\u2019s Anthony Rendon and Juan Soto.\n\nThey\u2019ve been ice-cold for weeks. In Game 3, they may have started to break out. Soto had a two-run homer to center off Hyun-Jin Ryu in the first inning, then fisted a soft single into left and drew a walk in the best all-around game he\u2019s had since mid-September. Rendon had a line single and walk, but seemed a bit further away.\n\nSince the Nats scored more runs than any team except the New York Yankees after May 23, with Rendon and Soto doing the most damage, few noted that Soto ended the year 3 for 38 (. 079) with one double while Rendon was 2 for 26 (. 077) with no extra base hits.\n\nThose are not tiny blips. Their slumps were genuinely troubling, especially since those two heart-of-the-order stars, usually the epitome of calm, became a jumpy and impatient at the plate as pitchers started walking them constantly. Soto\u2019s 15 walks and Rendon\u2019s 13 during their respective dry spells put plenty of runners on base for the Nats. But the No. 3 and No. 4 hitters misplaced their timing and extra-base punch.\n\nEntering Game 3, the pair had shown bits of progress \u2014 especially Soto\u2019s season-changing two-run single \u2014 which ended up scoring three runners because of an error \u2014 to beat the Brewers in an elimination game.\n\nBut, all in all, the duo still entered Sunday night bearing little resemblance to themselves. Rendon, who\u2019s been \u201cvery sick,\u201d according to Martinez, with a bug that\u2019s gone around the clubhouse for more than two weeks, had been 2 for 10 in postseason with one RBI and four strikeouts, while Soto was 2 for 12 with five whiffs.\n\nHeart-of-the-order duos tend to explode in tandem. If a combined 3 for 6 with a homer and two walks is a sign of more, and perhaps even better, to come, then this NLDS may be far from over.\n\nBut, make no mistake, the Dodgers showed up big and nasty in a game they dearly needed to win with Scherzer and Strasburg lined up to ruin their season if they failed on Sunday night.\n\nThe Nats\u2019 aces are still in play. And Corbin, gamely, if not wisely, told Martinez, \u201cI\u2019ll be ready tomorrow.\u201d\n\nThe Nats\u2019 star starters are a fine foundation. However, offense, loads of it, has been the other calling card this year. Continued improvement from Rendon and Soto, which may ignite the rest of this lineup, will be needed, and soon, for the Nats to \u201cStay in the Fight\u201d with such a heavyweight.", "description": "The aces are still available, and Max Scherzer is on deck, but the heavy hitters have to contribute more for Washington to extend the series.", "authors": ["Thomas Boswell", "Sports Columnist", "October At Am", "Tom Boswell Has Been A Washington Post Sports Columnist Since He Started At The Post In As A Copy Aide", "He Spent Years As A General-Assignment Reporter", "Covering Baseball", "Golf", "College Basketball", "Tennis", "Boxing"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/w3oaXR5w_pXOtJV8Vr5I-DngSQI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4W4MHEHITAI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
