This actually aired yesterday morning in the UK, but it\u2019s enough fun that it\u2019s worth watching today. Our colleagues at Townhall have a clip of the most heated moment between Morgan and Extinction Rebellion\u2019s Skeena Rathor, but the whole 12-minute segment is worth watching.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take long for Morgan to fire off his opening volley over Rathor\u2019s personal commitment to zero-carbon-emission living \u2014 which Rathor spends most of this segment attempting to dodge.\n\nThe meat of this argument around the 5:30 mark of the video, right after Rathor starts talking about the need to \u201cdisrupt businesses.\u201d Rathor never does answer Morgan\u2019s questions, but be sure to watch all the way through to confirm:\n\n\u201cDo you see the problem with all this? You go on about \u2018My kids can\u2019t get out of bed because they\u2019re all so terrified,\u2019 I\u2019m not surprised they\u2019re terrified because your mum\u2019s telling them everyday the planet\u2019s about to end, and yet, I bet your own carbon footprint, for all the stuff I\u2019ve just mentioned is terrible,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cSo why don\u2019t you give your computer, give up your television, give up your air conditioning, walk your kids to school, get a bike to the studio. Why don\u2019t you practice what you preach?\u201d he added.\n\nRathor said the problem is \u201creally not about individual carbon footprints,\u201d but that she needs to be within the system in order to \u201craise the alarm\u201d about the issue. Funny, that \u2014 most people work within the system in order to provide a living and their current standard of living. That\u2019s precisely what Rathor is doing and is completely unwilling to give up, even if she doesn\u2019t want to admit it or even acknowledge the issue.\n\nWhy? Rathor says she doesn\u2019t want to be \u201cthrown into a shame situation.\u201d Oh, well \u2026\n\nAnyway, there are other good moments in here besides Morgan\u2019s chasing Rathor around the rhetorical mulberry bush. Mike Neville notes that Extinction Rebellion\u2019s antics cost a lot of money for working-class folks and for the businesses that employ them, which apparently is part of the \u201cdisruption\u201d that Rathor likes better than giving up television. Neville refers to the activists as \u201cchampagne socialists,\u201d which is a phrase that makes watching the whole clip worthwhile on its own. Although I do have to give props to Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201cuncooperative crusties\u201d remark in the chyron, too. They\u2019re both keepers.", "description": "\"I'm not here to answer questions about my personal life.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/morgan-rathor.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
