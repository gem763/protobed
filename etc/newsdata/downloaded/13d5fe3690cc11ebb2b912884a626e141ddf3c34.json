Shape Created with Sketch. PL30: Power rankings 1/31 PL30: Power rankings We rank the 30 best players in the Premier League right now, based on their form since the start of the season. EPA 2/31 30. Joel Matip (Liverpool) Not always the prettiest on the ball but he plays out from the back effectively. Alongside van Dijk he has been impressive by his own merit with his domineering physical presence. Getty Images 3/31 29. Ashley Barnes (Burnley) He still makes the list despite his recent halt in form. He has largely been a difficult prospect for defenders this season, grabbing four goals. PA 4/31 28. Sebastien Haller (West Ham) A difficult start has soon blossomed into powerful performances for Haller. He has three goals and an assist to boot in a West Ham side with high hopes this season. Getty Images 5/31 27. Caglar Soyuncu (Leicester) Excellent against Spurs, and doing his best to fill the Harry Maguire shaped gap. He\u2019s a different defender to Man Utd\u2019s new powerhouse. Smaller, but technically gifted and a tenacious defender. Getty Images 6/31 26. Andriy Yarmolenko (West Ham) Has returned with a bang since tearing his Achilles last season. The opener against Man Utd last weekend was followed up with another classy finish against Bournemouth. AFP/Getty Images 7/31 25. John McGinn (Aston Villa) Easily Villa\u2019s best player this season. Tenacious, adventurous and has notched some goals too. He\u2019s on three for the season, including two in his last two against Burnley and Arsenal. Villa may be struggling, but McGinn is flourishing in the top flight. Aston Villa FC via Getty Images 8/31 24. Daniel James (Manchester United) The young Welshman has impressed in an underwhelming Man United side. Any suspicions that he needed time to settle in the top tier have been quickly dismissed. Getty Images 9/31 23. Enda Stevens (Sheffield United) His performance against Liverpool showed his delivery is first class, control is immaculate and defensive work is sound too. Truth is he has been flawless so far this season, and will soon receive more than a few plaudits. Getty Images 10/31 22. Youri Tielemans (Leicester) Level on number of through balls with Kevin De Bruyne and providing more than a supporting role for Maddison, Tielemans has been excellent. Action Images via Reuters 11/31 21. Aaron Wan-Bissaka (Manchester United) Wan-Bissaka has been a cause for optimism in an otherwise disappointing Man Utd side. He has made more tackles than any other player this season (31) and has been a stable part of United\u2019s faltering defence. Getty Images 12/31 20. Gary Cahill (Crystal Palace) What a signing for Palace. Made his debut in a 2-1 win at Old Trafford and Palace have since kept two clean sheets. Cahill\u2019s experience has definitely contributed to that. REUTERS 13/31 19. Mohamed Salah (Liverpool) Wasteful at Bramall Lane and bailed out by a goalkeeping error. But still enjoying yet another fine campaign. Getty Images 14/31 18. Todd Cantwell (Norwich) He isn\u2019t blessed with pace or flamboyant skill. But he finds space and you can\u2019t knock a player who has scored against Chelsea and Man City this season. Getty Images 15/31 17. Trent Alexander-Arnold (Liverpool) An average performance against Sheffield United on Saturday. But the week before he scored a brilliant goal at Stamford Bridge and Liverpool still have the best defence in the league. Getty Images 16/31 16. Emiliano Buendia (Norwich) An under-acclaimed part of Norwich\u2019s attacking success this season. He\u2019s second in the assists chart on four and has been simply sensational. Pukki\u2019s right hand man. REUTERS 17/31 15. Sadio Mane (Liverpool) The last couple of game have been frustrating for Mane. Especially Saturday\u2019s clash with Sheffield United where he missed two golden chances. Still, he\u2019s on four goals for the season and will surely be up there in the Golden Boot contest. Getty Images 18/31 14. Mason Mount (Chelsea) His pressing and goal scoring touch have been magnificent. A big future ahead. Getty Images 19/31 13. Ederson (Manchester City) e is joint first in the race for the Golden Glove, and yesterday\u2019s game at Goodison could have gone very differently without a number of big saves. Getting down to Mina\u2019s second half header the highlight. PA 20/31 12. Andy Robertson (Liverpool) Mr Reliable is at it again this season. Rarely a mistake and he has also contributed two assists going forward this season. He also made a crucial block at 0-0 against Sheffield United that changed the course of the game. Getty Images 21/31 11. Callum Wilson (Bournemouth) A goal against West Ham on Saturday and a delightful brace including a long range lob against Everton the week before. This man wants to be on the plane come June. AFC Bournemouth via Getty Images 22/31 10. Roberto Firmino (Liverpool) Firmino is at his best again this season. In typical fashion, not topping the goal charts, not topping the assist charts, but contributing in both with three of each. Unsung hero klaxon. Getty Images 23/31 9. Tammy Abraham (Chelsea) He didn\u2019t get a goal on Saturday against Brighton, but Chelsea\u2019s no.9 linked up well with his colleagues in attack. He\u2019s still second in the Golden Boot race on seven. Getty Images 24/31 8. James Maddison (Leicester) A simply blistering performance against Spurs last week. The way he has ran games so far this season makes him a shoe-in for England. CameraSport via Getty Images 25/31 7. Raheem Sterling (Manchester City) He was arguably the best player on the pitch against Everton, and yet again he grabbed a goal thanks to goal line technology. He\u2019s on six for the season now. Manchester City FC via Getty Ima 26/31 6. Harry Kane (Tottenham Hotspur) The Englishman dragged his side out of a big hole on Saturday. His winner helped Spurs see off Southampton despite being a man down. It wasn\u2019t pretty, but it was decisive. AFP/Getty Images 27/31 5. Teemu Pukki (Norwich) The Finnish striker hasn\u2019t hit the mark in the last two games - defeats at Palace and Burnley. He is still on six goals and two assists with a home game against Villa up next. A good chance to rediscover his form. Getty Images 28/31 4. Sergio Aguero (Manchester City) On am incredible eight goals and two assists already, Aguero failed to score for the first time on Saturday - but only because he was rested for much of the game. PA 29/31 3. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (Arsenal) With Lacazette injured, the Gabon international has stepped up to the mark in his preferred striker position. He was also scoring regularly from the left though, and grabbed a crucial winner from a free kick last week against Villa. United next for Arsenal. Getty Images 30/31 2. Virgil van Dijk (Liverpool) Liverpool benefited from a substantial amount of luck against Sheffield United. But they also had the best defender in the world at the peak of his powers. Seven clearances, 12 aerial duels won, and 12 completed long passes. Table toppers. Getty Images 31/31 1. Kevin de Bruyne (Manchester City) The Belgian midfielder is on fire. He leads the assists chart on eight, four ahead of next best. With two goals on top of that, no one has been involved in more goals than him.
