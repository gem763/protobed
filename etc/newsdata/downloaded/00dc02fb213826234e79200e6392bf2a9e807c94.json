Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Their plans would all but spell the end of private health insurance and cost the federal government an extra $32 trillion over a decade by some estimates.\n\nImage 1 of 6 \u25bc In this March 23, 2019, photo, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg arrives to speak about his presidential run during the Democratic monthly breakfast at the Circle of Friends Community Center in Greenville, S.C.

He released climate proposal earlier in September that could cost between $1.5 trillion and $2 trillion over 10 years.\n\nThat plan is small change compared to the ones unveiled by other Democratic presidential hopefuls. Andrew Yang's proposal would cost $4.87 trillion and Massachusetts Sen.
