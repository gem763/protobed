'We weren't allowed to mix with anybody. My dad was back in prison again but it felt as if we had been sent to prison too.'\n\nSusan Swinton, 60, from Nottinghamshire (pictured), has called the three years of her childhood spent living in Southwell's workhouse 'traumatic'\n\nSusan, who was eight when she moved in to the workhouse, said it left her with a deep sense of loneliness (pictured, centre)\n\nThe property (pictured) was built in 1824, and functioned as a workhouse until 1948. It is now the best preserved example of a Victorian workhouse in the country\n\nIn her early childhood, Susan and her family had lived in a Victorian terraced house in Newark.\n\nBut when her father, who was in and out of prison, moved in with his girlfriend, the family were left with nowhere to go - and spent a night with the Salvation Army.\n\nThe next day, they were taken to Southwell Workhouse, which was known at the time as Greet House.\n\nSusan went on to explain how it was a 'relief' at first, as her father wasn't there to 'belt' her or to fight with her mother - but it wasn't long before the warehouse began to wear the family down.\n\nSusan's mother Joan (pictured) had a breakdown in the workhouse, leaving the youngster to do much of the family's cooking and cleaning\n\nHistory of Southwell's Workhouse Built in 1824, Southwell's Workhouse is the best preserved example of a Victorian workhouse in the country. The system implemented here was developed by the Reverend John T. Becher and George Nicholls whose ideas shaped the way in which the poor were treated during the 19th century. For most of the 20th century, Becher\u2019s Workhouse was known as: 'Greet House'. When the New Poor Law system was disbanded in 1929, workhouses were handed over to local authorities. They continued as hospitals, or as institutions for the poor, homeless and elderly. With the advent of the modern welfare system in 1948, the building's use changed, providing temporary homeless accommodation until 1976. It was then used for staff accommodation and storage until the 1980s, while the rest of the site became a residential home for the elderly. It is now owned by the National Trust, who have reconstructed what the property would have looked like when it was functioning as a workhouse.\n\nWith no lights and very little privacy, Susan became petrified of the workhouse and admitted the dark, echoing rooms frightened her.\n\n'My mum gave up,' she explained. ' She didn't care if she lived or died. She would either sit there being quiet, or cry.'\n\nSusan's mother became increasingly dependent on alcohol and sleeping pills, leaving the youngster to fend for herself and the rest of the family.\n\nShe would use the family's social security money to buy food and pay rent, and Susan was left to do most of the family's cooking and cleaning.\n\nShe also bought alcohol for her mother and said the children got to such a stage that they would go without food in order to ensure she had her sherry.\n\nSusan, who had no idea what it was like to have a hair-cut, only wore second-hand clothes donated by charities and paid 'traumatic' visits to the doctor in order to get her mother's sleeping pills.\n\nWhile others moved into the workhouse before moving out to a council property, Susan admitted she felt forgotten about.\n\nIt wasn't until three years later that she and her family were moved out and into a council home in Southwell.\n\nThe workhouse went on to be used by social services and for elderly care, before it was bought by the National Trust, who restored it.\n\nSusan now volunteers at the workhouse with the National Trust, and says visitors are often stunned to learn she lived in the house at one stage (pictured, meeting Alan Titchmarsh at the property)\n\nSusan is among the volunteers at the property, and said visitors often think she is in 'cloud cuckoo land' when she tells them she used to live in the building.\n\nBut while she continues to have 'a lot of anger' about what happened to her, she also finds it important that people know and understand the history of the house.\n\nShe added: 'When you live in a place like that, with no neighbours, no friends, you really know what isolation feels like. It's a really deep-down thing that will always be with me.'", "description": "Susan Swinton, 60, from Nottinghamshire, moved into the Victorian workhouse in Southwell in 1968 with her family.
