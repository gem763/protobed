Another Boeing document warned that if a pilot failed to respond in more than 10 seconds to the software, activation could lead to a \"catastrophic\" failure.\n\nMuilenburg acknowledged \"we made some mistakes\" on the development of MCAS, an anti-stall system that automatically pushed the plane\u2019s nose down, leaving pilots fighting for control.\n\nU.S. Representative Peter DeFazio, who heads the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee holding the hearing, pressed Muilenburg on why the company had not required data from crucial airflow sensors known as attack sensors when it originally designed the airplane. Muilenburg said the company had repeatedly asked the same question.\n\nLast week, Indonesia investigators found Boeing failed to grasp risks in the design of MCAS.\n\n\u201cThe design and certification of the MCAS did not adequately consider the likelihood of loss of control of the aircraft,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe 737 MAX, when it returns, will have a number of new safeguards. It will take data from the attack sensors and not let MCAS activate more than once before a situation has been resolved.\n\nDeFazio asked why Boeing approved MCAS when it was vulnerable to a single point of failure.\n\nDeFazio also questioned why Boeing scrapped initial plans to install an MCAS \"annunciator\" alert and how pilots could be expected to recover if the system failed, when Boeing failed to disclose details on MCAS system to pilots. He also hammered Boeing's assumptions on how long it would take pilots to respond to a failure.\n\n\"I've talked to a lot of pissed off pilots,\" DeFazio said.\n\n\"We need answers. We need reforms on how commercial aircraft are certified,\" and how manufacturers like Boeing \"are watched\" by regulators, he added.\n\nAt one point in the hearing, Representative Rick Larsen of Washington state, where Boeing builds the 737, asked Muilenburg to name three mistakes the company made.\n\nMuilenburg quickly listed Boeing's failure to disclose for months that it had made optional a cockpit alert flagging disagreement between the airflow sensors. \"We got that wrong,\" he said.\n\nMuilenburg also said, \"clearly, we had some areas to improve\" regarding MCAS. And finally he said the company should have been more \"efficient and comprehensive\" in its communications and documentation \"across all of our shareholders.\"\n\nBut Muilenburg deflected a follow-up question on whether he could name specific individuals who were to blame for these mistakes, noting that larger \"teams\" were responsible for each of these areas.\n\nLater, Congressman Dan Lipinski of Illinois, where Boeing is headquartered, told Muilenburg: \"I am not sure what accountability means if you got a $15 million bonus after Lion Air,\" a reference to the crash in Indonesia.\n\nMuilenburg began his opening remarks by turning and looking directly at family members of the victims seated closely behind him as he apologized for the 346 lives lost in crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia.\n\nIn an earlier statement, DeFazio said the panel was aware of \"at least one case where a Boeing manager implored the then-vice president and general manager of the 737 program to shut down the 737 MAX production line because of safety concerns.\" Boeing did not comment Tuesday on the allegation.\n\nThe hearing, the highest-profile congressional scrutiny of commercial aviation safety in years, heaps pressure on a newly rejiggered Boeing senior management team fighting to repair trust with airline customers and passengers shaken by an eight-month safety ban on its 737 MAX following the two crashes.\n\nMuilenburg told reporters on Wednesday he believes the allegation was in response to concerns about a change in the increase of the production rate. He said Boeing was aware of those concerns and had acknowledged them.\n\nMuilenburg said that he had met with some family members of the victims before the Wednesday's hearing. \"It was tough to hear,\" he said, adding the company was making \"the fixes we need to make.\"", "description": "Boeing Co Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg acknowledged the company made mistakes in the development of a key safety system known as MCAS at the center of two fatal 737 MAX crashes, at a U.S. House hearing on Wednesday.
