This audience can see,\u201d she said at a book festival sponsored by the Library of Congress on Saturday. \u201cThat I am alive. And I am on my way to being very well.\u201d\n\nHer response was greeted with a passionate ovation from the 4,000 in attendance to hear her speak, just one week removed from having a malignant tumor removed from her pancreas.\n\nGinsburg had to be helped up the stairs to reach the stage, but once she got there, she revealed that her work as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, a position former President Bill Clinton appointed her to back in 1993, is helping to distract her from the pain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI love my job,\u201d she told the audience. \u201cIt has kept me going through four cancer bouts. Instead of concentrating on my aches and pains, I just know that I have to read a set of briefs and go over a draft opinion. Somehow, I have to surmount whatever is going on in my body and concentrate on the court\u2019s work.\u201d\n\nDemocrats nationwide have held their collective breath following Justice Ginsburg\u2019s most recent health scare, but her appearance on Saturday, combined with a recent busy schedule, has given them hope that she will likely outlive President Donald Trump\u2019s presidency so a Democrat can potentially appoint her successor.\n\nThis past Monday, she was in Buffalo to receive an honorary degree, where the extraordinary demand for tickets forced a last-minute venue change to a nearby sports arena with a capacity of nearly 18,000.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, Justice Ginsburg will be in North Little Rock, Arkansas for a public appearance on Tuesday, where another 16,000 people await her arrival, according to NPR correspondent Nina Totenberg.\n\nThen, she\u2019s off to Raleigh, Chicago, with two appearances in New York and then back to Washington throughout the next three weeks.\n\nLast week\u2019s surgery marks Ginsburg\u2019s fourth separate cancer treatment over the years, having two malignant nodules removed from her left lung in December, treatment for early-stage pancreatic cancer back in 2009, and then surgery for colon cancer in 1999.\n\nHowever, her most recent procedure comes with extremely long recovery times and a high rate of complications, according Dr. Daniel Labow, the chairman of surgical oncology at Mount Sinai Health System.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a surgery we do often, but you\u2019re in the hospital for a week, and you\u2019d not be 100 percent yourself for six to eight weeks, and maybe three months,\u201d Dr. Labow said.\n\nGinsburg\u2019s recent busy schedule and workload is par for the course for the Brooklyn-native, who has never missed an argument in her 25-year career as a Supreme Court Justice, barring a two-week period in January following her lung surgery a month prior.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "\"I love my job,\" Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg told a crowd Saturday afternoon, noting she uses it as a way to distract herself from the pain.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/11/0/0/AP18312506644404.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
