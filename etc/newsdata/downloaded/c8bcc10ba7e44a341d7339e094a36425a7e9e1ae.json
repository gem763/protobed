The temporary ban can be renewed after 120 days.\n\nGovernor Jay Inslee also issued the state liquor and cannabis board to draft legislation permanently banning all flavored vaping products and any ingredients found to be the cause of related lung illnesses. It would also require all ingredients in flavored vaping products to be disclosed.\n\nAfter making the announcement in a press conference, Gov. Inslee said he \"wanted to do more by this executive order\" and described the order as \"a floor, not a ceiling\" to discuss vaping.\n\nThe executive order comes amid growing nationwide concern on the hazards associated with the vaping products. In Washington, there are seven current cases of lung illnesses in the state, most recently in Pierce County.\n\nVaping-related death toll rises to 12, health officials say\n\nWashington is not the only state calling for a ban on vaping. Michigan, New York and Rhode Island all declared emergency bans this month on flavored vaping products, excluding tobacco flavor.\n\nMassachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker went even further when he declared a public health emergency and ordered a four-month ban on the sale of all vaping devices in the state, not just flavored products.\n\nE-cigarette makers like Juul have marketed their products to users as a less-deadly alternative to smoking, which has divided health officials. The American Lung Association has said that \"e-cigarettes are not safe,\" but the American Cancer Society said they're \"likely to be significantly less harmful for adults than smoking regular cigarettes.\"\n\nBut vaping products have been subjected to increasing scrutiny after they were connected to an outbreak of more than 800 mysterious pulmonary illnesses that have impacted e-cigarette users nationwide, including 12 deaths. What is causing the outbreak is not yet known.\n\nOther states like Arkansas, Texas and Washington have enacted laws raising the legal age to buy any tobacco product including e-cigarettes to 21.", "description": "There are currently seven cases in the state of the mysterious lung illnesses associated with flavored e-cigarettes", "authors": ["Sarah Min"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/27/fdec727b-c465-420d-9cce-48722531408c/thumbnail/1200x630/4579dd1ccdba16de19d47cb887f14f66/gettyimages-1044550250.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
