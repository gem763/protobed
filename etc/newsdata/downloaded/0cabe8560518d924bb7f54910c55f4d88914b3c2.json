It must be an eye-for-eye,\" Museveni said. \"Nothing less will be acceptable.\"\n\nDeath is the maximum penalty in Uganda for a range of crimes including murder, treason and defilement, but executions are rare.\n\nMuseveni's statement came after two recent murders figured extensively in Ugandan media.\n\nLast Thursday, his nephew was found lying on his back on the tarmac on an expressway near the capital, dead from gunshot wounds. His body was found near his parked vehicle, where a woman was in the back seat, also dead from gunshot wounds.\n\nOn Aug. 30, the bodies of a woman working for a local non-governmental organization and her driver were found dumped in a swamp just east of the capital Kampala, two days after they were kidnapped in their own vehicle outside the gate of the woman's home.\n\nMuseveni blamed the deaths of the NGO worker and her driver partly on the negligence of police officers who, he said, had not acted swiftly to use a recently installed CCTV system on all Kampala roads to intercept their vehicle and rescue the victims.\n\nPolice who were negligent, he said, have been arrested and he has ordered that they be tried and dismissed.\n\n\"If those who are in uniform today cannot do their job, there are plenty who will replace them.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Elias Biryabarema; Editing by Maggie Fick and Clarence Fernandez)", "description": "Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni has said he wants courts to hand out eye-for-an-eye-style sentences for all murder convicts, to help stem soaring violent crime that claimed the life of his nephew last week.
