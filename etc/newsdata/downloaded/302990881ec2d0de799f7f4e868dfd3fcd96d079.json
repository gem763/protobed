he didn't even care yet he looked after himself.\"\n\n(Image: liverpoolecho.co.uk)\n\n(Image: liverpoolecho.co.uk)\n\nWallach, who is hard of hearing, kept his own bedroom clean and tidy, along with a 'smoking room' where he would relax away from his sick wife.\n\nEmergency services who attended the address wore protective clothing because it was so filthy, with bags of rubbish with rotting and mouldy food.\n\nValerie's health was so grave that she was found babbling by paramedics and firefighters.\n\nThe ulcers to her buttocks, backs of thighs and both heels were categorised as 'Grade 4' pressure sores, said to be 'of the worst kind', which revealed deep tissue damage extending down to the bone.\n\nSkin was left behind on the armchair when Valerie was eased up, with a foul smell coming from the leaking ulcers.\n\nPiles of papers, Pot Noodle packaging and filled bin bags covered every surface surrounding the brown leather Chesterfield chair.\n\n(Image: liverpoolecho.co.uk)\n\nThe neighbour added: \"Her screams became a lot more frequent last few months and my children started to get scared towards the end.\n\n\"He was a horrible neighbour, always had his TV on blasting or his music to drown out his wife's screams.\n\n\"I'm really not surprised he did what he did because from the arguments I heard he was selfish, manipulative, and nasty with a vile attitude.\n\n\"He's a disgrace.\"\n\n(Image: liverpoolecho.co.uk)\n\nWhen the bereavement officer at the Royal Liverpool Hospital offered to pay for a basic funeral package for his wife, Wallach 'became agitated that it did not include the provision of a car for him.'\n\nValerie, who was covered in brown slime when she was rushed to hospital, ultimately died from breast cancer and multi-organ failure.\n\nLast week, a judge branded remorseless Wallach \"thoroughly selfish\" at the end of his trial.\n\nThe Wallachs were married for 15 years and had moved to Liverpool in 2003, having no visitors to the house, and no relatives other than their two children.", "description": "Richard Wallach was jailed for eight years after a jury found him guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence at\u00a0Liverpool Crown Court", "authors": ["Luke Traynor", "Image", "Merpol", "Liverpoolecho.Co.Uk"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20315398.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_LEC_LTRA_270919_WALLACH.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
