Photo: Courtesy of Peter Manso\n\nIt wasn\u2019t so long ago that the once-fearsome lawyer Roy Cohn and his infamous career seemed destined to be no more than a colorful footnote to history. Cohn was a gaudy character, for sure \u2014 a hustler, a fixer, and an amoral hypocrite of incredible drive \u2014 whose life as a closeted man ended in tragic comeuppance when he died of AIDS in 1986, insisting to the last that he couldn\u2019t possibly be dying of that gay disease. Tony Kushner wrote a vivid version of him into Angels in America, and that might have been the last word on Cohn if not for the fact that, in midlife, he had met and started giving legal and how-to-get-away-with-it life advice to a then-young Donald Trump, helping mold him into the man who became president.\n\nThis year, two ambitious Roy Cohn documentaries seek to explain this troubling figure. Matt Tyrnauer\u2019s Where\u2019s My Roy Cohn? came about while the director was making a documentary on Studio 54, where Cohn not only spent his off-hours hobnobbing amid its disco debauch but also served as the legendary nightclub\u2019s preening attack lawyer. A week after the release of Tyrnauer\u2019s Cohn doc, Ivy Meeropol\u2019s Bully. Coward. Victim. The Story of Roy Cohn has its world premiere at the New York Film Festival (it will air on HBO next year). Meeropol\u2019s grandparents were Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, whom a patriotically zealous young Cohn, right out of law school, helped send to the electric chair for spying for the Russians. (In 2004, she made a documentary about her family, Heir to an Execution.) But curiously, hers is somewhat more generous than Tyrnauer\u2019s film in depicting Cohn\u2019s transactional humanity, including the brazen orchestration of his gayness, especially later in his life in Provincetown, where he was the closest to being out that he had ever been able to be (the movie features a series of never-before-seen personal photos of Cohn, one of which is above).\n\nEven Meeropol\u2019s title is a bit poetically humanizing: It is what was written on Cohn\u2019s panel of the AIDS Memorial Quilt, unfurled in 1987 to eulogize those who\u2019d succumbed to the disease. But the director admits that for much of her life, she really didn\u2019t know anything about Cohn besides his helping to do great harm to her family. When I met up with her at Snack Taverna in the West Village, near where she was finishing the final edits on the film, she made it clear that her family\u2019s story wasn\u2019t the lens through which she wanted to show Cohn.\n\nWhy did you decide to make this film?\n\nThis story has been percolating with me since 1988, when my father and I stumbled on Roy Cohn\u2019s panel on the AIDS quilt. Neither of us knew that he was gay or that he had died of AIDS. I only knew him as a name, as an evil specter from the [Rosenbergs\u2019] trial. He was a fascinating figure, and for many years there\u2019d been no real documentary treatment of him. But I actually thought, Somebody else can do that. I don\u2019t have to be the Rosenbergs\u2019 granddaughter all the time in my work.\n\nDo you know who made that panel?\n\nWe don\u2019t. We tried to find them. It\u2019s an anonymous person, but we have a letter that they wrote about why they wanted people to know who Cohn was. I\u2019m hoping maybe when the film comes out that this person will come forward. We\u2019ve borrowed the title because, at the moment, we both had this reaction like, Good, the bastard. But then, simultaneously, Oh, the poor bastard.\n\nThat is the feeling of the film.\n\nI\u2019m glad you felt that way. That is what I was grappling with. Because it\u2019s not so simple. He\u2019s not just evil. Well, he is evil, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s interesting to me. There was something about the fact that this is a story that\u2019s resonating again now that made it important to tell. Angels in America was coming back to New York; Trump had been elected. I knew by then that Cohn had been his mentor, his lawyer, his good friend. I don\u2019t believe he created Trump. I think that\u2019s overstated. But you can pinpoint where Trump started to get the idea that he could be president, and Cohn had a lot to do with it.\n\nHe touches on so many aspects of our history. He started with the Rosenberg case, so that\u2019s my entry point. Then he went on to be [Senator Joseph] McCarthy\u2019s right-hand man, and then, and then, and then \u2026 But then he goes to Provincetown, where he lives more openly and happily. I find that poignant, that he could go there and be that way. That was a part of his life I wanted to bring out. I love Provincetown; I know a lot of people there. Nicholas von Hoffman wrote a biography of Cohn many years ago, called Citizen Cohn, which became an HBO film with James Woods playing him. That book opens with Cohn in Provincetown.\n\nI thought, Oh wow.\n\nTo access people who knew Cohn, you had to navigate a kind of Establishment that would automatically be dismissive of you. How did you handle that?\n\nMany of these people would not normally want to talk to me because they would assume that I\u2019m coming at this with an agenda, that I\u2019m just going to slam Cohn and it\u2019s going to be a one-note thing. But I told them, \u201cI\u2019m not interested in that. I want to hear your stories of Cohn.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s an incredible treasure trove of his personal materials in the film.\n\nIt\u2019s his personal photo collection. They show how happy he was there. It\u2019s him with all these young men, smiling and shirtless and in Provincetown, and beautiful Polaroids on the boat and family photos of him as a baby. There\u2019s this black-and-white one that I love. There\u2019s three men next to him, all looking in the same direction. It\u2019s like he\u2019s in his element. As Nathan Lane says in the film, Roy grew up in a time when he couldn\u2019t be open \u2014 and if he had been, he\u2019d have been incredibly brave, and he clearly wasn\u2019t. I think it turned him into a malevolent force. The hypocrisy is one of the worst things \u2014 that he would support Reagan while he\u2019s dying of AIDS and Reagan\u2019s not doing anything except helping him get access to early trials of AZT.\n\nA cartoon from the magazine Now East, outing Cohn.\n\nOne of my favorite parts of the film is when this former male prostitute turned gym owner decides to wage war on Cohn by creating a magazine called Now East, all about how he\u2019s gay.\n\nIsn\u2019t that incredible? That story! [Journalist] Peter Manso had a box of materials that I started going through. I actually have footage of Peter going through the magazine going, \u201cOh my God!\u201d Laughing his head off. It\u2019s hilarious. And so inventive. One thing they did was create a fake New York Times insert \u2014 like another section that looked exactly like the New York Times. It was all about how Cohn\u2019s gay and Cohn\u2019s this and Cohn\u2019s that. They inserted it into the Sunday papers all over the city. Like, in the middle of the night, when the papers were dropped off at newsstands, someone went around and stuffed these in so that people woke up to their Sunday paper and there was a fake insert that outed Cohn. We didn\u2019t even put in half of what these guys were doing to harass him.\n\nJohn Waters steals the show, as usual.\n\nHe\u2019s just such a pleasure to interview. I was kind of playing with him, too. He was talking about everyone doing cocaine and Roy doing cocaine, and then I said, quietly, \u201cDid you ever do cocaine with him?\u201d And that\u2019s when he goes, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have my nostril on the same straw as that pig.\u201d\n\nAnd then Alan Dershowitz. It\u2019s almost too perfect that he and Cohn worked together and were so close.\n\nI had read an article where Dershowitz talks about Cohn having told him about my grandparents\u2019 trial and that Cohn had said he\u2019d framed guilty people. So of course I wanted to know Dershowitz\u2019s take on that. And it turned out to be an incredible interview. I can find hundreds of left-wingers who will tell us that, but to have a right-winger like him telling me, telling us, telling the audience, telling the world, that Cohn fixed the case \u2026 And Dershowitz himself thinks it\u2019s one of the greatest miscarriages of justice ever.\n\nWhy do you think Cohn told him that?\n\nHe wanted Dershowitz to like him, to understand and respect him. And he wanted New York Jews in particular to understand why he did this. \u201cWe knew they were guilty; that\u2019s why we had to execute them.\u201d He was concerned about his reputation in the Jewish community. It was important to distinguish yourself from the so-called bad Jews. The good Jews versus the bad Jews. Which is why my grandparents\u2019 trial was stacked with a Jewish judge and a Jewish prosecution team, including Cohn.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the interesting things about living in this era of Trump: These formulations of identity and place within American culture are being taken apart again. And you\u2019re sort of like, \u201cOh right, this is where that comes from.\u201d\n\nFor many people, we thought this was the past. We really thought we were in the clear. And now we\u2019ve been with Trump long enough to know that\u2019s not true.\n\nThat\u2019s another quality Cohn shares with the people who now surround Trump. He\u2019s aware of what\u2019s happening to other people and says, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen to me. I\u2019m going to make sure the system works for me.\u201d He tried to game the system. I guess the fact that his own uncle, who ran a bank which collapsed during the Great Depression, and was sent to prison, was a warning for what could go wrong.\n\nI have that exchange with Roy\u2019s cousin David Marcus, where I say, \u201cThis is crazy. I\u2019m sitting here talking to you, and Roy Cohn sent my grandparents to Sing Sing,\u201d and Dave Marcus\u2019s grandfather, Roy\u2019s uncle, was in Sing Sing. Uncle Bernie. I find that story pretty amazing because he was the only Jewish banker who ended up there. Of all the savings-and-loan disasters, he was the only one who got sent away. It was a Jewish community bank.\n\nMarcus actually says, \u201cWell, every family has its Roy Cohn.\u201d\n\nYeah, and his mom says, \u201cI hope not. The world would be a terrible place if that happened.\u201d\n\nWhere\u2019s My Roy Cohn? opens September 20; Bully. Coward. Victim.
