On Thursday, White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney managed to do both in the space of a few hours. At a press briefing, Mulvaney baldly admitted that Trump had held up money allocated to Ukraine in order to pressure that country\u2019s government into investigating Democrats. \u201cThe look back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the thing that he was worried about in corruption with that nation,\u201d Mulvaney said. \u201cDid he also mention to me in passing the corruption related to the DNC server?\u201d Mulvaney added. \u201cAbsolutely. No question about that.\u201d According to Maggie Haberman of The New York Times, Trump saw part of this briefing and \u201cwas happy with how Mulvaney did and sent him that message.\u201d Ad Policy\n\nBut Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Jay Sekulow felt Mulvaney\u2019s comments could create legal problems. In short order, Mulvaney issued another statement that falsely accused the media of mispresenting the briefing and contradicted his earlier statement. \u201cOnce again, the media has decided to misconstrue my comments to advance a biased and political witch hunt against President Trump,\u201d Mulvaney\u2019s statement claimed. \u201cLet me be clear, there was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election.\u201d\n\nAt the earlier briefing, Mulvaney also made news by saying that next year\u2019s G-7 meeting will be held at the Trump National Doral Miami resort in Florida. This Trump property has had difficulty attracting guests, but now will receive a cash influx from both American taxpayers and America\u2019s allies. The prospect of foreign governments\u2019 lining the president\u2019s pockets is a bald-faced violation of the emoluments clause of the Constitution. Even House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has been reluctant to impeach Trump, tweeted, \u201cThe Constitution is clear: the President cannot accept gifts or payments from foreign governments. No one is above the law. #EmolumentsClause\u201d MORE FROM Jeet Heer On a Crowded Stage, Democrats Divide Into 2 Tribes October 16, 2019 Giuliani Made Trump\u2014and Might Now Unmake Him October 14, 2019 \u2018Joker\u2019 Brings Class Warfare to the Big Screen October 11, 2019 Author page\n\nMulvaney\u2019s flaunting of Trump\u2019s misdeeds in Ukraine, his subsequent ham-fisted attempt to deny his own plain words, and the emoluments violation in Doral should all force Democrats to reconsider the scope and scale of impeachment. Pelosi has been pushing for a quick and narrowly focused impeachment that looks only at the quid pro quo deal with Ukraine. I had initially supported Pelosi\u2019s cautious approach to impeachment, believing that by moving rapidly and focusing only on Ukraine, the Democrats could establish the point about Trump\u2019s corruption without bogging down the political system. My worry was that impeachment would dominate the discourse and make it impossible for the Democratic presidential hopefuls to focus on policy debates.\n\nBut it\u2019s now clear that it\u2019s impossible to contain impeachment, since Trump\u2019s only response to being challenged is to become ever more brazen. Mulvaney\u2019s press briefing was an attempt to normalize Trump\u2019s use of foreign policy as a tool to target political enemies. And when that attempt failed, Mulvaney lied about his own words, adding a layer of obstruction to the initial offense. That\u2019s the way it is with impeachment: Trump and his cronies have no ability to defend themselves in a legal manner, so they\u2019ll pile misconduct on top of misconduct.\n\nThe nature of Trump\u2019s presidency precludes a focused impeachment. Just as the hunters in Jaws realized that they needed a bigger boat to go after the giant shark, the Democrats will need a bigger impeachment to fight against Trump, an impeachment that will force minions like Mulvaney to realize that they face legal peril if they keep covering up Trump\u2019s crimes.\n\nEven beyond the acts that cry out for impeachment, Trump\u2019s handling of foreign policy is increasingly erratic, with terrifying real-world consequences. Trump claims to have secured a cease-fire in Syria between Turkey and the Kurds, an achievement that seems more notional than real. Speaking at a rally in Dallas, Trump spoke in the condescending language of imperialism, saying, \u201cSometimes you have to let them fight like two kids. Then you pull them apart.\u201d As Brett McGurk, a Republican who worked as an envoy for Trump in the Middle East, tweeted, \u201cThis is an obscene and ignorant statement. 200k innocent people displaced. Hundreds dead. Credible reports of war crimes. ISIS prisoners escaping. US evacuating and bombing its own positions or handing them to Russia. Two kids in a lot?\u201d Current Issue View our current issue\n\nOne of the merits of a wider impeachment is that it could encompass this foreign policy misconduct, an area where many congressional Republicans have misgivings about Trump. After all, we still don\u2019t know why Trump green-lighted the Turkish invasion of Syria. It\u2019s possible, as many have speculated, that Trump\u2019s financial interests in Turkey are a factor. An impeachment that expanded to include investigating Trump\u2019s Turkish connection would help Congress hold his foreign policy in check.\n\nWriting in Crooked, Brian Beutler notes, \u201cUnless Republicans at some point decide to cut Trump loose, the end of the impeachment inquiry will also mark the end of regular oversight. Trump will continue defying subpoenas and return to trying to steal the election, knowing the danger has passed, and the House\u2019s power to do anything about it all will revert to its nadir.\u201d Given this outcome, Beutler rightly argues that Democrats should escalate impeachment.\n\nThe major argument against impeachment has always been a pragmatic political one: the fear that it would cost Democrats congressional seats and Senate races. But since Pelosi gave thumbs up for the impeachment process, it has gained steadily in popularity and now has majority support.\n\nPollster Geoff Garin, who has worked for Hillary Clinton and many other Democratic candidates, tweeted on Thursday, \u201cI am not big into predictions but here is one I feel confident about: Not a single House Democrat will lose her or his seat next November because of their support for impeachment. In fact, I feel more confident about this with each passing day.\u201d A Morning Consult poll shows that impeachment has been hurting Republicans in Senate races, not Democrats. As Morning Consult sums up, \u201cRepublicans representing Colorado, Arizona, North Carolina, Maine and Iowa all saw their net approval\u2014the share of voters who approve of a senator\u2019s job performance minus the share who disapprove\u2014decline between the second and third quarters of 2019.\u201d\n\nImpeachment doesn\u2019t just help Democrats politically. It also keeps Trump on the defensive and off his guard, thus putting a check on his ability to cheat in the 2020 election. As long as impeachment is an option, Trump and his cronies will know that any cheating they do could potentially be added to the docket. My earlier fear was that impeachment would prevent the 2020 Democratic nominee from getting their policy message out. But given Trump\u2019s actions, impeachment is the only way to insure a clean election.", "description": "A narrow and quick impeachment is no longer sufficient for a White House that flaunts its crimes.", "authors": ["Jeet Heer", "October", "Miriam Lafontaine", "Alan Maass", "Aaron Mat\u00e9", "Johannes Anyuru", "The Nation", "Mychal Denzel Smith"], "top_image": "https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/impeachment-mulvaney-rtr-img.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
