Leading Morris through the presentation was Twisted Wire host Phil Dobbie. Here are just some of the points discussed:\n\nPhysical workspace-tied desktops will not be the default work area\n\nProject and task-driven projects\n\nData retrieval and information access will not be linear and hierarchical, but semantic and driven by intent and need\n\nTomorrow's workspace managers will need to know how to juggle all these new \"workspaces\"\n\nYou can watch and listen to that webinar by clicking on the window above.\n\nIf you've got thoughts on what the desktop of the future will look like, please leave your comments in the Talkback section below. We look forward to hearing from you.", "description": "Check out ZDNet Australia's webinar on the future of the desktop.", "authors": ["Brian Haverty"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/12/01/f7247ce5-7921-11e4-b569-d4ae52e95e57/thumbnail/770x578/6b13fca5ff3ebf4ba352617147400fec/zd-defaultimage-news.jpg"}
