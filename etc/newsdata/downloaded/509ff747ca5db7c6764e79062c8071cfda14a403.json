He says I inspired him to dig deeper into his heart to consider whether I was the right person for him.\n\n\"For me, it was empowering to stick to what I wanted, to be able to articulate it, to draw boundaries, and for once care about what made me happy instead of a man.\n\n\"Until a man is willing to give you his heart, why should he deserve yours?\"", "description": "A woman has revealed the bold decision she made when she started dating her now-husband", "authors": ["Courtney Pochin", "Image", "Getty Images", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20063823.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_JS192653342.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
