But Johnson was prepared. Instead of explaining his concerns about leveraging military aid to ensure an investigation that would benefit Trump politically, Johnson tried to shift the conversation in a different direction: to an assertion that Trump had been unfairly targeted since he won the 2016 election.\n\nJohnson quoted a December 2016 text message between former FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page in which Strzok said that their \u201csisters\u201d \u2014 others in the intelligence community \u2014 had begun \u201cleaking like mad\u201d because they were \u201cscorned and worried and political.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThat is why Trump is so upset,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cHe had this false narrative, that resulted in him being set by up [then-FBI Director] James Comey on January 16th. Then he has the special counsel appointed that has hampered his entire administration. And now, once he\u2019s been \u2014 that was proven false, he would like to know, and I would like to know, and I know his supporters would like to know, where did this all come from? Who planted that false story?\u201d\n\nThis is not a particularly good example of redirection. The leaks in December 2016 centered on the existence of an investigation into Russia interference in that year\u2019s election that also addressed possible overlap with the Trump campaign. The leaks weren\u2019t a \u201cfalse narrative\u201d; that investigation existed. The special counsel\u2019s investigation didn\u2019t result in anything being proved false; instead, it documented the scale of the Russian interference effort and determined that there was insufficient evidence to bring criminal charges against any Trump campaign staffers for aiding that effort.\n\nJohnson has something of a track record of trying to insinuate devious activity by Strzok, Page and other government officials. In early 2018, Johnson declared that an informant had told the Senate about a secret anti-Trump society within the FBI. That purported \u201csecret society,\u201d though, stemmed from a joking message between Strzok and Page, and no \u201cinformant\u201d was ever identified.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Sunday, Todd\u2019s response to Johnson\u2019s reply was to wonder how \u201cFox News conspiracy, propaganda stuff is popping up on here.\u201d The answer, of course, is that Trump\u2019s Ukraine conspiracy theories derive from information amplified on Fox News \u2014 and that his defenses are cultivated in the welcoming Petri dish of Fox programming. Johnson\u2019s efforts were emblematic of the focus of many defenses of Trump, which have been offered by his allies in the past few weeks: focused squarely on those who already agree with Trump and who accept the same flawed premises about the Russia investigation and the administration of Barack Obama that Trump does.\n\nTo Johnson, Trump's outreach to Ukraine was defensible, given that Trump \u201chad very legitimate concerns and reservations about Ukraine\u201d including, first, \u201ccorruption, generalized.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s endemic,\u201d Johnson added. \u201cWe all know that. And then specifically about what kind of interference in the 2016 election.\u201d Johnson pointed to a 2017 article from Politico in which two incidents involving Ukraine \u2014 a Democratic National Committee staffer\u2019s freelance investigations into then-Trump campaign staffer Paul Manafort and the release of documents linking Manafort to illegal payments \u2014 were combined under a broad umbrella of Ukrainian interference efforts. The article, though, notes that there\u2019s \u201clittle evidence\u201d of these discrete incidents being part of a top-down strategy from the government.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEven beyond that, Johnson's argument is weak: Trump's anti-corruption push in his call with Ukraine's president went no further than to ask that Biden and his son be investigated.\n\nSo Johnson does a just-askin'-questions move: \u201cI don\u2019t know to what extent DNC and Hillary Clinton campaign were involved in kind of juicin\u2019 up the Ukrainian involvements, as well.\u201d And, no, he told Todd, he didn\u2019t trust as dispositive any FBI or CIA investigations that occurred under Obama \u2014 or any investigators who worked under Obama.\n\nPerhaps Johnson is sincere. Perhaps he truly thinks that there was a sweeping, unproved conspiracy undertaken by numerous corrupt officials that failed to uncover evidence linking Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign to the precise sort of things of which Trump was accused. Or perhaps he\u2019s just offering the best defense he can muster of a president to whom he wants to demonstrate loyalty.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWithin that Fox News world that helped birth Trump\u2019s Ukraine theories, Johnson\u2019s efforts were praised. Todd\u2019s efforts to get Johnson to explain why he had winced at an apparent effort to link aid with a 2016 investigation earned him the title of \u201cdisgrace to humankind\u201d from professional Fox News anger-monger Dan Bongino.\n\nTrump\u2019s son Eric appeared on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d to assert that Todd\u2019s questioning of Johnson and ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos\u2019s interview with Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) were \u201cdangerous to this country.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, honestly, the media in doing that\u201d \u2014 interrupting politicians who weren\u2019t answering questions directly \u2014 \u201cthey pose a danger to this nation,\u201d Eric Trump said. \u201cI mean, look at the advocacy there!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nEric Trump criticized Stephanopoulos as biased for having once worked as an adviser to Bill Clinton. The interview with Jordan that was so offensive, though, concentrated on an effort to get Jordan to say whether it was appropriate for Trump to have asked China to investigate Biden last week.\n\nAD\n\nThis, Jordan insisted, was not a sincere request.\n\n\u201cYou're telling me the guy who's been tougher on China really thinks that's going to happen?\u201d Jordan said at one point, implying that China wouldn't want to help Trump. \u201cIt's not going to happen.\u201d\n\nThe problem, of course, is that Trump\u2019s administration is engaged in a trade war with China. Why should we not assume that China might try to gain leverage in negotiations by offering Trump some sort of dirt on Biden \u2014 however legitimate?\n\nAD\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) was asked on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d about Jordan\u2019s representation that Trump was \u201ctrolling China\u201d and \u201chaving fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou watch what the president said,\u201d McCarthy replied. \u201cHe\u2019s not saying China should investigate, but let\u2019s get to the clear point: If I\u2019m a member of Congress and I break the law and there should be investigation and I run for another office? You still investigate me.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump, of course, explicitly asked China to investigate Biden.\n\n\u201cBy the way, likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens,\u201d he said on Oct. 3, as memorialized in a White House transcript, \u201cbecause what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with \u2014 with Ukraine.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThere\u2019s no reason to think that Trump was joking in any respect. Trump keeps talking about China and Ukraine in concert, allegations derived from a book that appears to have been the tipping point for Trump\u2019s focus. Why Trump would be joking or be insincere about a Chinese investigation when he\u2019s been adamant in his sincerity about a Ukrainian one is unclear \u2014 beyond that his request of China was massively problematic.\n\nAt least in the objective political world. In the subjective world of Trump\u2019s political base, this is all just another effort to smear the president.\n\nJohnson\u2019s efforts on Trump\u2019s behalf appear to have paid off with that audience.\n\nSleepy Eyes Chuck Todd of \u201cMeet the Press\u201d had a total meltdown in his interview with highly reaspected Senator @RonJohnsonWI. Seems that a not very bright Chuck just wasn\u2019t getting the answers he was looking for in order to make me look as bad as possible. I did NOTHING wrong! \u2014 Donald J.
