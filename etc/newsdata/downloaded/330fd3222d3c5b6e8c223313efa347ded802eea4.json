Could it be just a sliver of extra time so the government can finish off the match?\n\nBut as things stand, Boris Johnson's team are not willing to take that approach.\n\nThey fear any delay could ensnare them in weeks, and then potentially months, of argument and further delay.\n\nOne senior figure told me: \"We are just not going to get anything through this Parliament\u2026 we have to go to the country.\"\n\nA Downing Street source said \"Parliament blew its last chance\" and warned - as Boris Johnson did at the despatch box - that if the EU agrees the delay as requested, they will try to push for an election as soon as they can.\n\nNo certainty\n\nRemember, there is nothing automatic about that happening - a move for an election must be approved by MPs.\n\nBut having failed to get his desired Brexit timetable through Parliament, and having almost inevitably broken his promise to take us out of the EU whatever happened this month, the prime minister seems intent on giving up on Parliament, and asking the country what's next instead.\n\nHe's exchanging one battle for another with, again, no certainty that he will come out on top.", "description": "No 10 wants to ask the country what's next, but there is no certainty the government will come out on top.", "authors": ["Laura Kuenssberg", "Political Editor"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10B5B/production/_109334486_ukparliament_jessicataylor-8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
