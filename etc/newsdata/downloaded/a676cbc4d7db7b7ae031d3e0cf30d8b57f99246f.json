The procedure, which is done in a cardiac catheterization lab and typically takes about an hour, is one of the most common in modern heart medicine. In most cases, a balloon-tipped wire is inserted via a catheter through the wrist and threaded up into the artery clogged with plaque. The balloon is then expanded to clear the blockage. During the procedure, the patient is usually under what is called conscious sedation, doctors said.\n\n* STENTS\n\nStents are tiny mesh tubes that are placed into the cleared artery to keep it propped open, allowing normal blood flow to the heart. In almost all cases, the stents are coated with a drug that helps prevent the formation of scar tissue that could lead to reclogging. Some form of imaging, such as intravascular ultrasound, is used to guide the procedure and to make sure the stents are appropriately sized for long-term durable results.\n\n* MEDICATION\n\nPatients who undergo artery-clearing procedures must then take blood thinners or platelet inhibitors to lessen the risk of formation of dangerous blood clots that can lead to stroke or heart attack. Depending on the patient, they would typically be on those drugs for six months to a year.\n\nMost often, patients are given aspirin and Plavix, known generically as clopidogrel. Some newer drugs, such as Eli Lilly and Co\u2019s Effient (prasugrel) or AstraZeneca\u2019s Brilinta (ticagrelor) may also be used.\n\n\u201cFor someone who had a heart attack and got a stent, we use those more powerful medications, assuming they are not at high bleeding risk,\u201d said Dr. Deepak Bhatt, executive director of interventional cardiovascular programs at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston.\n\n* RECOVERY TIME\n\nFor a patient with chest discomfort, known as unstable angina, who has not had a heart attack, recovery time from angioplasty and stenting is remarkably fast. If there has been no damage to the heart, which is presumably the case with Sanders, a patient can be up and around in an hour and released from the hospital that same day or the next, doctors said. If the procedure is successful, there are no restrictions for physical activity.\n\n\u201cHe could be on the campaign trail tomorrow, even at 78,\u201d said Dr. Ashish Pershad, an interventional cardiologist at Banner \u2013 University Medicine Heart Institute in Phoenix.", "description": "U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, who is seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, has been treated for a blocked heart artery after experiencing chest discomfort, leading to cancellation of some planned campaign events.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
