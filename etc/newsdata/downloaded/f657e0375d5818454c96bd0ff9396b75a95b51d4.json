The date of 2025 has been mooted, as long as both communities agree to it.\n\nA European source was quoted by the Times as saying: \"A landing zone on consent could be a double majority within Stormont, to leave, not to continue with the arrangements after X years.\" (Reporting by Estelle Shirbon and Elizabeth Piper; editing by Guy Faulconbridge)", "description": "The European Union is ready to make a \"major concession\" on a Brexit deal by offering a mechanism for the Northern Irish assembly to leave a new so-called backstop after a number of years, The Times newspaper reported on Wednesday.
