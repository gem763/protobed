(AP) - Kyle Allen will make his second straight start Sunday when the Panthers visit the Houston Texans.\n\nCarolina coach Ron Rivera wasted no time Monday ruling out quarterback Cam Newton for a second straight game due to a lingering mid-foot sprain. Rivera said there is \u201cno timetable\u201d for Newton\u2019s return and that the 2015 league MVP will continue to receive treatment.\n\nNewton originally hurt his foot in Carolina\u2019s third preseason game and then aggravated the injury in a Week 2 loss to the Buccaneers. He has not practiced since.\n\nRivera gave no indication Newton would need surgery, instead saying that what the QB needs the most right now is rest.\n\nAllen\u2019s threw four touchdown passes in Carolina\u2019s 38-20 win over the Cardinals on Sunday, improving to 2-0 as an NFL starter. He was 19 of 26 passing for 226 yards and finished with a 144.4 QB rating, the second-best mark in franchise history.\n\nHe completed passes to seven different players, including two TD passes to tight end Greg Olsen and one each to wide receivers Curtis Samuel and DJ Moore.\n\n\u201cHe had good command of what we were doing and spread the ball around, which is what I like to see because then you can\u2019t focus on one guy,\u201d Rivera said.\n\nRivera especially liked the way Allen responded after a fumble on the game\u2019s first drive.\n\n\u201cThe one thing I have always said about Kyle that impressive me is he handles those things,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cHe\u2019s always cool. He\u2019s kind of aloof to things that happen and that he can\u2019t control. So he\u2019s always one of those guys that goes on to the next play.\u201d\n\nAfter Sunday\u2019s game Allen downplayed his success.\n\n\u201cYou do your job. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been preaching all week. You do your job,\u201d Allen said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do too much. When your number is called, make plays. \u2026 Everyone, when their number was called, people made plays.\u201d\n\nRivera said when Newton is healthy he\u2019ll return to the starting lineup.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s our quarterback and he\u2019s who we rely on,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cBut for now we\u2019re going to stick with Kyle and we\u2019ll keep rolling and see how things unfold as we go forward.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Kyle Allen will make his second straight start Sunday when the Panthers visit the Houston Texans.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Reed"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/buccaneers_panthers_football_95758_c0-158-3780-2361_s1770x1032.jpg?4cf8d91ab985b6bdf16abf575ce8866398896294", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
