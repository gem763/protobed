Investigating officers described the incident like a scene from crime drama Luther which stars Idris Elba\n\nHills received a seven year sentence and was told he will remain on extended licence for a further four years\n\nHills was jailed for seven years by Bristol Crown Court.\n\nThe officer in the case compared the footage to something from dark crime drama Luther.\n\nHills, 26, claimed that he was a victim of mistaken identity at a trial in Plymouth Crown Court in June.\n\nBut he was quickly convicted by a jury of false imprisonment, being in possession of a bladed article and making threats to kill the woman back on January 2.\n\nJudge Paul Cook, having adjourned the case for a psychiatric report, has now sentenced Hills to seven years in prison with an extended licence of four years.\n\nThe judge, sitting at Bristol Crown Court, said that he would not be considered for release by the parole board until two thirds of the way through his sentence.\n\nMost offenders are freed at the half-way point.\n\nPeter Hills, pictured, was sentenced to seven years in prison following his conviction in Bristol Crown Court for false imprisonment, being in possession of a bladed article and making threats to kill the woman\n\nIt means probation will continue to supervise him for the full 11 years, whenever he is set free.\n\nJudge Cook said the psychiatric report was disturbing.\n\nThe court heard that he claimed to have no memory of the attack - so there was no clue to his motivation.\n\nBut Hills had his wits about him enough to shout out to a concerned neighbour, claiming the woman whose scream he had heard had just fallen over.\n\nSpeaking after the case DC Nathan Drew said: 'This was an extremely disturbing case involving a stranger-attack on a lone female in a dark, deserted city centre.\n\n'The victim was in the wrong place at the wrong time, having just returned to Plymouth from Italy.\n\n'Chilling CCTV footage, reminiscent of a scene from the TV show Luther, shows she was hunted through the streets of Plymouth, until she reached a secluded spot and was attacked.'\n\nThe trial heard how the victim had just returned to Plymouth from a Christmas break in Italy when she was attacked on January 2.\n\nBrian Fitzherbert, for the Crown Prosecution Service, said she left the main coach station in Plymouth at about 6am.\n\nThe barrister showed the jury CCTV of a man following the woman a few metres behind through dark and deserted streets.\n\nShe said one hand suddenly appeared over her shoulder and she saw the other holding a kitchen knife about six or seven inches long.\n\nThe 19-year-old described how the blade was held a few inches from her chest.\n\nShe said she felt 'blocked'.\n\nMr Fitzherbert put her statement to her and she confirmed that the man said 'I have to kill you' several times.\n\nThe witness added that she could not recall how long the stranger had held her.\n\nBut she said that she screamed and he ran away.\n\nHomeless Hills was arrested ten days after the offence sleeping in a subway at North Cross.\n\nHe was wearing clothes similar to that of the attacker on January 2.\n\nThe court heard that Hills told police it was not him in the CCTV footage - which does not capture the attack itself.", "description": "Peter Hills, pictured, was jailed for to seven years following his conviction in Bristol Crown Court for false imprisonment, being in possession of a bladed article and making threats to kill the woman", "authors": ["Darren Boyle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/11/19877576-0-image-a-2_1571393495858.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
