Fans gathered on courts amid Hong Kong\u2019s high-rise buildings Tuesday to vent their anger.\n\nThe player for the Los Angeles Lakers touched a nerve among protesters for suggesting that free speech can have negative consequences. They have been protesting for months in defense of the same freedom that James said can carry \u201ca lot of negative.\u201d\n\nThe protesters chanted support for Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey, something of a hero among demonstrators in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory for having tweeted on Oct. 4 in support of their struggle, infuriating authorities in China.\n\nWhat the crowd of approximately 200 people chanted about James wasn\u2019t printable.\n\n\u201cPeople are angry,\u201d said James Lo, a web designer who runs a Hong Kong basketball fan page on Facebook. He said he\u2019s already received a video from a protester that showed him burning a No. 23 jersey bearing James\u2018 name.\n\nHe expects more, given the backlash from protesters who\u2019ve been regularly hitting the streets of Hong Kong and battling police because of concerns that the international business hub is slowly losing its freedoms, which are unique in China.\n\n\u201cStudents, they come out like every weekend. They\u2019ve got tear gassed and then they got gun-shot, like every weekend. Police beating students and then innocent people, like every day. And then he (James) just comes up with something (like) that. We just can\u2019t accept that.\u201d\n\nJames made his comments in response to a question about whether Morey should be punished for his tweet that reverberated in China and had consequences for the NBA.\n\n\u201cYes, we do have freedom of speech,\u201d James said. \u201cBut at times, there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you\u2019re not thinking about others, when you only think about yourself.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cSo many people could have been harmed, not only financially but physically, emotionally, spiritually. So just be careful what we tweet and what we say and what we do. Even though yes, we do have freedom of speech, it can be a lot of negative that comes with it.\u201d\n\nNBA players weren\u2019t made available before or after games in China, which CCTV didn\u2019t broadcast, and several companies and state-run offices reportedly severed their ties with the NBA over Morey\u2019s tweet and the league\u2019s response to it.\n\nProtesters said James\u2018 comments smacked of a double-standard, because he\u2019s used his clout as a sports headliner to press for social causes in the United States.\n\n\u201cPlease remember, all NBA players, what you said before: \u2018Black lives matter.\u2019 Hong Kong lives also matter!\u201d one of the protesters, 36-year-old office worker William Mok, said in addressing the applauding crowd.\n\nOthers said LeBron\u2019s comments made it seem that he\u2019s more worried about money than people.\n\n\u201cJames was trying, you know, to take a side, on the China side, which is like ridiculous,\u201d said Aaron Lee, a 36-year-old marketing director. \u201cHe was being honest, financially. Financial is money. Simple as that. LeBron James stands for money. Period.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "When the ball smashed into a photo of LeBron James' face stuck above the hoop and dropped into the basket, the Hong Kong protesters cheered.
