That was the massive task Andy and Barbara Muschietti faced with It Chapter Two.\n\nThe director and producer siblings hit a grand slam with 2017's part one, but it was so successful they had to jump right back into the world almost immediately. And after the first instalment, they\u2019d only adapted about a quarter of what Stephen King had originally written in 1986.\n\n\u201cWe flirted with making two more films,\u201d producer Barbara Muschietti told Gizmodo in Los Angeles last week. \u201cThen it was decided that we would only make one film but clearly there was a lot of material that Andy and our writers had to adapt.\u201d\n\nThose 900 or so remaining pages tell the story of what the kids from the first movie, the Losers\u2019 Club, are like when they grow up and how they come back to their hometown of Derry, Maine to kill the evil force they call \u201cIt.\u201d\n\nAs Andy Muschietti and his writer Gary Dauberman dove into that dense story, the first thing they realised was 900 pages of a book didn\u2019t mean 900 pages of a screenplay.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of It that\u2019s a lot of writing,\u201d director Andy Muschietti told Gizmodo. \u201cThe challenge was to wrap this huge work and translate it into film language. So the story is leaner. It\u2019s tighter. We turn the screws of tension to keep the audience on the edge of their seat all the time. And everything is more consequential. In the book, it\u2019s just looser.\u201d\n\nThat mantra to keep things more compact was so strict, it meant that the Muschiettis even had to go against the wishes of King himself.\n\nDirector Andy Muschietti on the set of It Chapter Two. (Photo: Warner Bros.)\n\n\u201cHe gave us a little list of things that he would like to see in the movie,\u201d Andy Muschietti explained. \u201cBut he is very gentle. He said like, \u2018Please take this. It is what it is. There are no strings attached.\u2019 It was more an affectionate thing with what he remembers of his own work.\u201d\n\nOne thing on the list that was added, per King\u2019s wishes, was the Paul Bunyan scene, where a huge statue of Bunyan chases young Richie. However, King also wanted to see the Standpipe rolling down the hill during the destruction of Derry from the end of the book, but the pair had to decline.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t go, at all, in that direction because I wanted to keep the ending more intimate and more about the emotions of the humans of this group,\u201d Muschietti added. \u201cSo we had to pass on that.\u201d\n\nIn keeping the film more about the emotions, there was also the decision to strongly suggest that one of the main characters is gay, which is just barely hinted at in the book, if at all.\n\n\u201cThat came from the exploration of fear of these characters in the adult years,\u201d Andy Muscheitti said. \u201cAs I was exploring with [Dauberman] this palate of different fears that these adult characters can have, certainly the fear of being exposed, someone that has been hiding a sexual identity, is something that a lot of people can relate to.\u201d\n\nBill Hader as grown-up Richie in It Chapter Two.

That was necessitated by the fact that the first film was about kids being threatened, but this one is about capable adults, which simply isn\u2019t as relatable or scary.\n\n\u201cWe went in knowing that we would have to raise the stakes precisely because of that,\u201d Barbara Muscheitti said. \u201cIt\u2019s harder to empathise with an adult. When a child is in peril immediately you\u2019re gonna be protective. We\u2019re gonna feel for the situation. When it\u2019s an adult, it depends on the adult. So we had to make sure that two prongs, one, our adults were absolutely people we could empathise with as we did with the kids. And then, on the other hand, that the stakes were higher.\u201d\n\nAndy Muscheitti says those stakes come down to one simple thing: making the film about growing up.\n\n\u201cIt is about the end of childhood,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why, in this story, adulthood is almost like a villain. Adulthood is the antagonist of childhood because it kills childhood. Everything that is great about childhood, all the treasures like imagination and the power of believing in things that don\u2019t exist just go away.\u201d\n\nThe young Losers back with Muschietti. (Photo: Warner Bros.)\n\nBut, for the adult Losers to ultimately defeat It, that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019ll need\u2014childish belief and imagination. That\u2019s why it plays a huge part in sculpting how they are portrayed in the film.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a survival mechanism, an unconscious need to remain children,\u201d Andy Muscheitti said. \u201cBecause they know deep inside, even though it\u2019s uncertain what happened to It in the end when they beat him up, there\u2019s an impending return of It. And that is keeping them children. Inside because they will need each other. They will need to access that. The power of belief.\u201d\n\nIt Chapter Two is in Australian theatres now.", "description": "The only thing scarier than Pennywise the clown is making Pennywise the clown scary again.
