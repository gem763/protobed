When I did it split down the seam.\"\n\nThe split caused boiling water fresh from the kettle to splash her stomach and leg leaving Sophie feeling \"sick\".\n\n\"I can't explain how it felt, I instantly felt sick,\" she said.\n\n\"I shouted to Mark. I was trying to take my clothes off but my hand was burning. My husband ripped them off and started chucking cold tea towels at me to cool me down.\n\n\"Mark phoned an ambulance and I went into shock as my veins had collapsed.\"\n\nSophie was rushed to the hospital for treatment where she was told she would need two skin grafts to try and repair the damage.\n\n\"I couldn't feel anything in my stomach or legs,\" she added. \"The whole time I was complaining about the pain in my hand rather than my stomach and my leg.\n\n(Image: lincolnshirelive.co.uk)\n\n\"The reason for this was the burn on my hand was superficial so the nerves were exposed. They were trying to get my wedding ring off my hand because it had swollen up.\n\n\"The nurses were trying to get control all the blisters that were coming up - there must have been 100 blisters on my stomach and legs. They were popping them open and covering me up to protect me.\"\n\nOn Friday, October 4, Sophie underwent a three hour operation to cover her burns by covering them with skin from the back of her right thigh.\n\n\"They didn't initially know how deep the burns were because they take about tow or three says to show how bad they are,\" she said.\n\n\"When I went for a check up they weren't sure whether I needed a skin graft, but I went back on Friday and they said I needed two.\n\n\"After the operation I had to stay in hospital as my graft was bleeding and I had to go back last night as well.\n\n\"I'm in a lot of pain and my mobility is very limited. It's had a very big impact and it's going to for a while. It's not going to get better for months.\"\n\nSophie says her friends couldn't believe it had happened to her and is urging them and anyone else who uses a hot water bottle to learn from her mistake.\n\n\"Listen to your husband when he says don't do it,\" she said \"He's been telling me for years and I've been saying you're paranoid. I know so many people who've said they do this.\n\n\"They always advise not to put boiling water inside in case this happens. I'm just grateful it happened to me and not a child.\"", "description": "WARNING: DISTRESSING IMAGES Sophie Mason, 29, said she had more than 100 agonising blisters after the accident in Waddington, near Lincoln", "authors": ["Matthew Lodge", "Image", "Lincolnshirelive.Co.Uk"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20540314.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHP_081019Slug_10566JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
