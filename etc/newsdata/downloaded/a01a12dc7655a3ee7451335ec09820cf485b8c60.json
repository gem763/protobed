Musi, from Charleston South, Carolina, used to travel the world while on assignments for National Geographic.\n\nThough he loved his job, Vincent felt he was not present enough for his son Hunter and feared he would miss out on too many milestones before he went away to college.\n\nSo he decided to quit and took up a new project - setting up shop in the back room of a pet groomer. Calling it the Unleashed Studio, Vincent began photographing local dogs - keeping a record of each hound and how they made him feel.\n\n'I'm always up for making photographs of something commonplace and doing it in a way that makes people care about it in a way they might not have before,' he told MailOnline.\n\nVincent used the same techniques he would have employed to capture a lion in its stride to photograph mutts, from Corgis to Dalmatians.\n\nThe result is a beautifully heartwarming and funny collection of snaps that show man's best friend at their very best, entitled The Year of the Dog (Chronicle). Feast your eyes on these paw-fect images.\n\nLuna is a three-year-old blue Doberman Pinscher. Vincent was deeply impressed by her very long tongue\n\nSeven-year-old Toy Poodle Peetrie made Vincent think of a Troll doll and stole the show at another dog's photoshoot\n\nVincent explained that street dog Ellie-Bou was a 'type A' personality who'd gone from scaring the neighbourhood to being part of the furniture\n\nThe photographer revealed in a humorous paragraph that French Bulldog Tolliver would not stop farting during their photoshoot\n\nVincent J. Musi started working on The Year of the Dog so he could spend more time with his son Hunter before he moved to college\n\nDalmatian Fox, Vincent said, was as young and restless as you'd expect a puppy to be, and peed, played and chased balls during the whole photoshoot\n\nVincent photographed Archie, a gorgeous Gordon Setter, when he was just two-months-old, and then again a year later\n\nOtis, a two-year-old Doberman Pinscher, shared the same hometown as Vincent: they were both originally from Pittsburgh\n\nPictured: Vegas, a 14-year-old greyhound. Vincent explained he tried to get Vegas to stand still for two hours in order to get her picture taken\n\nThurston Montgomery is a two-year-old Bernedoodle, who gets his name from his uncanny resemblance to Mr. Thurston Howell III from the 1960s 'reality' show Gilligan's Island\n\nCute mutt Lee Lee, three, was 'innocent and sweet' like a childhood drawing, according to Vincent", "description": "Vincent J.
