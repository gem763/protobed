There was a small explosion, when he set fire to a device.\n\n'The mosque was full of people at the time, and there was widespread panic. After wounding the two men, the man set fire to a car before disappearing.\n\nOne of the victims was placed in intensive care after being shot in the throat at point blank range, but both men are now 'in a stable condition', reports said (Pictured: A file photo of the Mosque of Bayonne, southwestern France)\n\nAfter reportedly wounding the two men \u2013 who have not been named - Sink\u00e9 was said to have set fire to a car and disappeared (Pictured: French police officers stand in front of the mosque in Bayonne, France)\n\n'He was later arrested by police at this home in the village of Saint-Martin-de-Seignanx.
