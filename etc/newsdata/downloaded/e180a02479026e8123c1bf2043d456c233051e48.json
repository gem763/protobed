Washington now advances to the best-of-seven NL Championship Series against the St. Louis Cardinals with Game 1 at Busch Stadium on Friday night. The NLCS winner gets the right to play in the World Series.\n\nKendrick\u2019s epic hit launched the Nationals into the team\u2019s deepest foray into the postseason since coming to Washington \u2014 and sent fans back home into a frenzy.\n\n\u201cProbably the biggest moment in my career,\u201d Kendrick said. \u201cIt is definitely a dream come true.\u201d\n\nThere were scenes of bedlam at the watch party at Nationals Park, with fans crying out in joy amid hugs and high fives. Twitter and social media erupted with congratulatory messages and videos of impromptu living-room celebrations.\n\nOn sports talk shows the next day, the woeful 0-5 Washington Redskins were an afterthought as the upstart Nationals got top billing for a change. Then, before the afterglow of Wednesday\u2019s heroics could subside, attention shifted to the Cardinals who were already trash-talking about the NLCS, even before finding out who their opponent in the next round would be.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t give a [expletive] who we play,\u201d Cardinals manager Mike Shildt told his team after they advanced Wednesday by crushing the Atlanta Braves. \u201cWe\u2019re going to [expletive] them up.\u201d\n\nShildt apologized on Thursday, after his fiery clubhouse speech went viral.\n\nThe Nationals may have something to say about Shildt\u2019s boast. The Nationals had losing records in the regular season against both the Milwaukee Brewers and Los Angeles Dodgers, only to send them packing into the winter. Along the way, the Nationals became the first team in major keague history to win two elimination games after trailing 3-1 in the eighth inning both times.\n\nThe Nationals\u2019 NLCS appearance is the furthest a Washington baseball team has advanced in the postseason since the Senators lost in the 1933 World Series.\n\nThe Nationals had reached the NLDS four previous times, but lost each one, with three of the losses coming in Game 5.\n\nMany fans wanted the Nationals to fire second-year manager Dave Martinez in late May when the team got off to a dreadful start. But the team earned a wild card spot, came back to beat the Brewers at home in that game,and then slayed a Dodgers team that won 106 games in regular-season play and had appeared in the past two World Series.\n\nNow the Nationals face a Cardinals team that won five of their seven meetings this year. Washington is 9-21 this decade in St. Louis and has won just two series there since 2005.\n\nThe Cardinals have won the World Series 11 times, most recently in 2011, and have appeared in the playoffs six times this decade. St. Louis beat Washington in the 2012 NLDS despite a walk-off homer in Game 4 by Jayson Werth. The walkoff was the most iconic homer in Nationals\u2019 history until Kendrick inserted himself into local baseball lore with his grand slam.\n\nSt. Louis is expected to start veteran right-handed pitcher Adam Wainwright (14-10, 4.19 ERA) on Friday at 8:08 p.m. The Nationals announced they will go with right-hander Anibal Sanchez (11-8, 3.85 ERA).\n\nWashington ace Max Scherzer is on track to start Game 2 Saturday at 4:08 p.m. with the series moving to Washington for Games 3, 4 and (if necessary) 5 from Monday through Wednesday.\n\nThe Cardinals get the home-field edge since they won a division title, while the Nationals were a wild-card qualifier.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
