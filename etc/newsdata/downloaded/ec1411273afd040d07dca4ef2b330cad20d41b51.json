This week both Beijing and Ottawa nominated new ambassadors, although a spokesman for the Chinese foreign minstry this week urged Canada to \u201creflect on its mistakes\u201d and immediately release Meng.\n\n\u201cAt present, China-Canada relations are facing serious difficulties,\u201d Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a daily briefing.\n\nGeng said China hopes the new Canadian envoy Dominic Barton can play an active role in returning ties to a \u201cnormal track\u201d.\n\nThe previous Canadian ambassador, John McCallum, was fired in January after he said it would be \u201cgreat\u201d if the US dropped its extradition request for the Huawei executive. She is wanted by the US on fraud charges and is currently out on bail in Vancouver and living in her multimillion-dollar home awaiting extradition proceedings.", "description": "* Canadian prime minister sharpens criticism of Beijing  * \u2018This is not acceptable in the international community\u2019Canada\u2019s relations with China soured after its arrest of Chinese Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou on a US warrant last December.
