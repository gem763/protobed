This year\u2019s crop is certainly no exception to that.\n\n\u2018Course, like any good costume gathering, there\u2019s more than a handful of stale references in the bunch. And if you\u2019re either Gary Ablett or Luke Dahlhaus you might want to smash that refresh button, because Alan from The Hangover and Salt Bae have certainly been done more than a few times before.\n\nCredit where it\u2019s due though: Ablett using a real baby in this version is a hell of a modifier.\n\nThe others though? Incredible stuff.\n\nPatrick Dangerfield coming as Port Adelaide player-cum-firefighter-cum-media pest Kane Cornes is a hell of a dig, even if Cornes couldn\u2019t let him have the last word on it.\n\nHe forgot the premiership medal\u2026 pic.twitter.com/e8T0M160ik \u2014 Kane Cornes (@kanecornes) September 25, 2019\n\nThere was some mild embarrassment for both Tom Stewart and Cameron Guthrie, who showed up wearing the same John Wick costume which surely means one of them had to go change (definitely not Guthrie, who went all out with the facial wounds and a faithful dog companion).\n\nThe entire youth population of Hawkins also showed up to proceedings, with Jack Henry, Stefan Okunbor, Jed Bews, Jake Kolodjashnij, Sam Simpson, Quinton Narkle, and Jordan Cunico proving that the Upside Down is probably somewhere in Corio.\n\nIronically enough though, the team\u2019s actual Hawkins didn\u2019t get on board the Netflix worship, with Tom Hawkins instead choosing to absolutely roast teammate Gary Rohan\u2018s infamous under-18s photo shoot, complete with an actual chook.\n\nElsewhere, there\u2019s Zach Guthrie and Rhys Stanley as two versions of the Captain America transformation.\n\nThere\u2019s Joel Selwood being a little less \u201cactual Freddie Mercury\u201d and a little more \u201cNick Riewoldt firing down the ice slide at the MCG.\u201d\n\nAnd then there was this excellent self-roast from Mark Blicavs, accepting his acting Oscar for his outrageous staging effort back in July, flanked by Brandon Parfitt as an entirely decent Bruno Mars.\n\nBut if you\u2019re looking for the 3-2-1 of the day, one vote goes to Wylie Buzza, who pointed out his lack of senior AFL game time this season with a remarkably good little shot at team management.\n\nTwo votes goes to Zac Smith, who showed up as a literal shit-stained toilet because apparently the boys won\u2019t stop leaving big dirty skiddies in the Kardinia Park loos (seriously).\n\nBut for the three vote, costume-of-the-day effort, it\u2019s hard to go past Scott Selwood and Esava Ratugolea as a remarkably good Billy Rae Cyrus and Lil Nas X from the beyond-iconic Old Town Road film clip.\n\nAbsolutely bloody nailed it. Top work lads.
