He claims he\u2019s seen his brother abuse ex-girlfriend Paris Hilton. Aaron also claimed that his late sister, Leslie, sexually abused him for years as a child. And he gave an update about his gun collection, tweeting \u2014 and then deleting \u2014 that he voluntarily surrendered some as concern over his mental health grows.\n\nHere are some of Aaron\u2019s wildest claims:\n\nAaron calls Nick a \u201cserial rapist\u201d and compares him to Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nAaron has publicly sided with Melissa Schuman, who accused Nick of rape as the #MeToo movement unfolded in 2017. (Nick maintained his innocence and no charges were filed as the statute of limitations had expired.) Aaron has since claimed there are more accusers and called for an \u201cR.Kelly-type documentary\u201d into his brother. On Thursday, he\u2019s gone so far as to brand Nick a \u201cserial rapist\u201d and compare him to Jeffrey Epstein, the late billionaire accused of sex trafficking underage girls. He seemingly claimed his brother silenced his accusers.\n\nNo he isn\u2019t. He\u2019s the Jeffrey Epstein. https://t.co/Ap8X35IPHI \u2014 Aaron Carter (@aaroncarter) September 19, 2019\n\nI smell a serial rapist https://t.co/942YTvkYCz \u2014 Aaron Carter (@aaroncarter) September 19, 2019\n\nYes.

Have you ever heard of corrupt systems or MONEY AND ABUSE OF POWER AND CELEBRITY STATUS TO SILENCE YOUR ACCUSERS? https://t.co/nre0Du612W \u2014 Aaron Carter (@aaroncarter) September 19, 2019\n\nAaron claims Nick abused him throughout their lives.\n\nSeveral times he has shared a clip of Nick giving him a pie to the face at the Kids\u2019 Choice Awards in 2001. He has said that Nick broke his nose during the incident \u2014 one of several times he allegedly broke it. He said Nick has been \u201can abusive human to me my whole life.\u201d\n\nI was 13 look at my brothers face before he broke my nose with a pie at the kids choice awards during my acceptance speech. \ud83d\udc4f hes bullying these women with power and money and now I\u2019m back. And powerful and welsthy and healthy.

(Nick denied the claims at the time.) Aaron claims he \u201cwitnessed the abuse to Paris from my brother. I was there.\u201d He also claims that Nick beat him up in front of Paris.\n\nListen. @ParisHilton knows what\u2019s going on. Trust me. She doesn\u2019t need to be dragged into anything. Cause my truth is my truth and I witnessed the abuse to Paris from my brother. I was there. https://t.co/wrEv3l38en \u2014 Aaron Carter (@aaroncarter) September 19, 2019", "description": "Aaron has continuously used Twitter to speak out and make various claims about his family members since his brother Nick and sister Angel filed a restraining order against him.", "authors": ["Suzy Byrne", "Editor", "Yahoo Entertainment"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/lKuwJxxls3h2RqqhiqZnTg--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/e2610f20-db02-11e9-bbb4-45926816a663", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
