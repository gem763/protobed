It was fake news from the beginning. It was a fake story.\"\n\nKevin Dietsch/EPA via Shutterstock\n\nCommerce Department officials have described the story as \"false.\u201d The department\u2019s inspector general has said the matters are now \u201cunder review.\u201d\n\nA separate Commerce Department spokesman said \u201cSecretary Ross did not threaten to fire any NOAA staff over forecasting and public statements about Hurricane Dorian.\"\n\nLast week President Trump also denied knowing anything about how that weather map appeared altered with a black marker to show Alabama in Dorian's path.\n\nBut multiple sources in the White House have since confirmed to ABC News that it was Trump himself who drew on the map.\n\nMembers of Congress were briefed Tuesday on the reported threat to fire NOAA staff, according to people familiar with the ongoing conversations.\n\nOn Wednesday, Senate Democrats sent a letter to the Commerce inspector general demanding answers.\n\n\u201cScientists within the federal government work for the American people, not for private industry or the President\u2019s personal vanity. Individuals and families across the country rely on weather forecasting to determine everything from what they wear each day to the decision to evacuate a home during extreme weather events. As deadly extreme weather becomes more and more common, maintaining public trust in these reports becomes increasingly important. Agency officials should not be sacrificing trustworthy weather reporting for political gain,\u201d the senators wrote in the letter.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii blasted the Trump administration for allegedly retaliating against NOAA employees.\n\n\u201cI am extremely concerned with anytime that there is a threat to fire people, to discipline people for stating facts, that should be a concern to all of us,\u201d Hirono told ABC News. \u201cBut sadly that's par for the course for this administration because they do not rely on facts or science for their positions. They have a position and everybody else has to conform to that position.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cThat's very dangerous for our country, but it's been going on pretty much since the president has taken office because he lies every single day and he just wants people around him who will enable him to keep on lying to the American people.\u201d\n\nABC News' Matthew Vann, Katherine Faulders and John Santucci contributed to this report.", "description": "President Donald Trump on Wednesday denied reports that the White House was involved in forcing NOAA to renounce weather forecasters who contradicted Trump.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/mick-mulvaney-file-ap-jef-180827_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
