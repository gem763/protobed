Courtesy of Jordan Jones\n\nAt the time she started Packed Party, Jones was 23 and working in marketing for a data analytics company, but was summarily fired after the firm noticed press coverage about Packed Party and realized Jones probably had other priorities.\n\nAnd yet, six years later, the brand has 15 employees, has grown its total customer base by 80% in the last year, recently announced a partnership with Whole Foods, and has had over 200% annual revenue growth since its inception. What it hasn't had is a single unprofitable year.\n\nBut even the most successful startup founders make mistakes. Jones shared with Business Insider the No. 1 mistake she's made as a young female founder and what she wishes she'd known when starting her company.\n\nThe biggest mistake I made was hiring too quickly and too soon\n\nBecause Packed Party has grown quickly in its six years of business, and because Jones started the company without much in the way of formal management experience, she initially felt pressure to put hires in place to fill an immediate void.\n\n\"I've never made a good hire that has propelled the company forward by plugging what felt like an exploding leak from the floor in a survival-type moment,\" she said. \"Once the ball gets rolling with your business and you have thousands of customers needing things, it's easy to reach for a resume that feels like a B+ rather than wait for an A player to come through the door.\"\n\nPacked Party offers bold products, including accessories, bags, drinkware, home and office supplies, and more. Courtesy of Jordan Jones\n\nThe \"good enough\" hire Jones made, in one particular case, said \"yes\" to too many tasks and then had trouble completing them. They missed a purchase order deadline, and the resulting chargeback hurt Packed Party's bottom line. \"Communication in our business is key,\" explained Jones. \"A lack thereof always ends in financial issues when you're dealing with tight deadlines and inventory.\"\n\nAnother hire made it difficult for Jones to build processes, which, in turn, affected the morale of future A-plus hires. \"A few people today on our team walked into a couple of operational nightmares early on that they've been amazing at sorting through,\" she said. \"For me, the quicker we closed the door on relationships not serving the company, the better off we were financially and culturally.\"\n\nNow I've removed myself from the hiring process entirely\n\nJones recognized she was part of the problem, typically hiring candidates based off gut feelings and instincts, similar to how she approached the brand's design process. \"I put a lot of emotion into it,\" she said. \"I was asking people about their mom, dog, cousin, and their favorite product.\"\n\nAnd, because she's young, early hires often saw her as less of a boss and more of a friend. \"Our brand is so fun, so there was \u2014 and still is \u2014 an expectation for me to stay in this playful, creative light,\" said Jones. \"You can be friendly at work but, at the end of the day, you're both there to get the job done. If it's not getting done, it isn't going to work.\"\n\nJones has since passed the responsibility of hiring and management to Packed Party's president and HR representative, both of whom handle recruitment and serve as employees' direct managers. She stills meets candidates to say \"hi\" and to ensure they're a cultural fit, but tries to primarily focus on her strengths: design and partnerships.\n\n\"Our president and HR person ask the hard-hitting questions and leave emotion at the door,\" said Jones. \"Today, as a multimillion-dollar brand, it actually runs a lot smoother not having my hands gripping the wheel. I don't have to do everything for us to be right side up; you take your time and put smart people in place, and your life gets a lot easier.\"", "description": "Business Insider chatted with Jordan Jones of retail brand Packed Party, who found that making just OK hires can really hurt your bottom line.", "authors": ["Allison Duncan"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d963f1891aad200290337b8?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
