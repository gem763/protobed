Turbo (pictured) died in a pool of blood as a result of being attacked\n\nThe man then grabbed the couple's other pet Nova and began to do the same before he was stopped by the dog's shocked owner.\n\nTurbo collapsed and died in a pool of blood, while Nova was rushed to a vet where she was treated for her injuries.\n\nNew Zealand SPCA chief executive Andrea Midgen said the man's actions were 'unfathomable'.\n\n'There is a proven correlation between violence against animals and violence against people, and thus, this sort of crime is particularly horrendous,' she said.\n\nThe man was sentenced to 26 months in prison and disqualified from owning animals for seven years.\n\nHe was ordered to pay $1742 in vet fees and $2000 in reparations.\n\nMs Midgen said the crime was 'particularly horrendous'.\n\n'I am pleased to see the sentence handed down for this egregious crime, sending a strong message that the full extent of the law will be applied to offenders who commit these unspeakable acts,' she said.", "description": "An argument broke out between the man and his two flatmates at a house in Auckland, New Zealand in February 2018 after he claimed the couple were stealing from him.", "authors": ["Thomas Duff For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/05/20165388-0-image-a-41_1571977913097.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
