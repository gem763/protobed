Today's decision reaffirms that students have the right to freedom of speech, and that they do not check their rights at the schoolhouse gate.\"\n\nShael Norris, the girl's mother, also hailed the decision. \"All my daughter ever wanted was for students to feel safe speaking out about sexual assault,\" she said in a statement through the ACLU.\n\n\"I'm so proud of her for standing up for what she believes in.\"", "description": "A Maine student suspended for a note warning of a \"rapist in the school\" wins her case in court.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0601/production/_109373510_cap34535315ture.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
