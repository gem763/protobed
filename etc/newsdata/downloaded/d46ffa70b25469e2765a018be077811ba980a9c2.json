And with each person comes a story.\n\n\"Over decades in the studio and dozens of trips we worked to get those stories on air. We both knew how lucky we were to have the opportunity. The only consolation is that we made the best of the time we had. \"\n\nThomas Dahlhaus, Newsday's deputy editor, added that Keane worked hard to pass his passion and wisdom on to new journalists entering the industry.\n\n\"I've never seen anyone help, mentor and support so many people, junior presenters and producers alike,\" he said.\n\nSome colleagues also posted tributes on Twitter, including former co-presenters Shaimaa Khalil and Ben James.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @Shaimaakhalil It\u2019s very hard to know what say... I presented my first ever Newsday program with Julian. He was so warm,calm and supportive. I\u2019ll miss waving and pulling faces at him on my way to the studio. I\u2019ll miss him smiling back. I\u2019ll miss listening to his voice... https://t.co/cRvGJgD86w \u2014 shaimaa khalil BBC (@Shaimaakhalil) October 30, 2019 Report\n\nSkip Twitter post by @BenJourno This is such sad news: Julian was one of the best to listen to - that warm, smooth, effortless delivery (while actually putting in a lot of effort!) - and such a lovely bloke to work with. Listen here to just a slice of what he brought to @bbcworldservice https://t.co/kPL25oDrVi \u2014 Ben James (@BenJourno) October 30, 2019 Report\n\nAnd, of course, tributes were paid to Keane in his natural home - on-air.\n\n\"We don't usually like to make the story about us, but I hope you agree this warrants it,\" Newsday presenter Lawrence Pollard told viewers.\n\n\"Julian Keane, a much loved and respected presenter on the show has died at only 57. Funny and talented, Clever and handsome, he was such a charming man it was impossible to object to his unfeasible array of qualities.\n\n\"To which we can now add bravery and consideration for others in the face of terrible illness. Julian won awards for his reporting and was someone we all learnt from by working with him over his 25 plus years.\n\n\"Needless to say, he would have written and read this better than I can.\"\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.
