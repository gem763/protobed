Ms Warren has also seen an increase in support, increasing by four points since June.\n\nMr Buttigieg's performances in the televised live debates between the candidates may be behind the jump in support.", "description": "Democratic candidate Pete Buttigieg has seen a surge in support to put him in third place in Iowa, according to a new poll, closely trailing the race's front runners Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren in the crucial state.", "authors": ["Rozina Sabur", "Eilis O'Hanlon", "Owen Paterson", "Stewart Jackson"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/04/28/TELEMMGLPICT000194909083-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqDQVK81QMLSkr-IuGRMUJHMBlQYzciaw9G4kdmm88BzI.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
