Picture taken August 29, 2019. REUTERS/Gleb Garanich/File Photo\n\nFor Zelenskiy, it was a far-reaching diplomatic disaster.\n\nZelenskiy\u2019s comments to the Republican Trump, disclosed in the summary, will likely irk U.S. Democrats, risking the bipartisan U.S. support Kiev requires while irritating France and Germany whom Zelenskiy criticised in the same exchange.\n\nLocked in a geopolitical standoff with neighbouring Russia after Moscow annexed the Crimea region and backed pro-Russian separatists fighting in eastern Ukraine in 2014, Ukraine needs all the international friends it can get.\n\nIt relies heavily on Washington for aid and diplomatic help, and European countries like France and Germany are trying to help bring about talks aimed at breathing life into a stalled peace process over eastern Ukraine.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately the main consequence of this is that Ukraine could become toxic,\u201d said Alyona Getmanchuk, director of the New Europe Centre in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cMaybe not as toxic as Russia became during the Mueller investigation, but toxic,\u201d she said, referring to a two-year U.S. investigation into contacts between Trump\u2019s successful 2016 election campaign and Russia.\n\nThe timing of the latest scandal is awkward for Zelenskiy, who is keen to reinvigorate parts of a stalled peace deal over eastern Ukraine, something for which he needs European and U.S. diplomatic muscle.\n\nThe White House memo summarising the call shows Zelenskiy promised to reopen an investigation into a company that employed former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son and voiced frustration about what he said was a lack of support from German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron when it came to enforcing sanctions on Russia.\n\nIt also showed Zelenskiy had agreed with Trump that the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine - Marie Yovanovitch - was \u201ca bad ambassador.\u201d\n\n\u2018EAGER TO INGRATIATE\u2019\n\n\u201cZelenskiy does not come out looking good from this - giving the ex-U.S. ambassador a kicking, Merkel and the Europeans a kicking, and then agreeing to do Trump\u2019s dirty work on Biden,\u201d said Timothy Ash, a senior emerging markets strategist at Bluebay Asset Management.\n\n\u201c(He) seems very eager to ingratiate himself with Trump.\u201d\n\nInternational investors have been hoping that Zelenskiy will make good on pledges to refashion Ukraine into a fully fledged transparent graft-free democracy. Ash\u2019s comments reflect growing scepticism on that score in some quarters.\n\nThe French foreign ministry declined to comment and the Elysee was not immediately available for comment. But French officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Macron had gone out of his way to meet Zelenskiy before he was elected, something that was uncommon in normal protocol.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from German officials.\n\nZelenskiy, who held talks with Trump in New York on Wednesday on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, had resisted calls for Ukraine to release details of the July 25 call with Trump during which the U.S. president asked him to investigate the son of Biden, the front-runner in the Democratic Party race for the November 2020 election.\n\nZelenskiy told reporters on Wednesday he had thought that only Trump\u2019s side of the call would be published and that he believed that details of such calls \u201cbetween presidents of independent countries\u201d should sometimes not be published.\n\nHe said he did not know the details of the investigation into Biden\u2019s son, saying it was one of many cases he discussed with world leaders if asked and that he wanted his new general prosecutor to investigate all cases without interference.\n\nZelenskiy also tried to smooth over things with Merkel and Macron, saying he was grateful for their help and that he had made his comments about them during \u201ca difficult period.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to say anything bad about anyone,\u201d Zelenskiy said after meeting Trump. \u201cWe thank everyone who helps us.\u201d\n\nDAMAGE DONE?\n\nBut some at home said the damage had already been done.\n\n\u201cOf course the background to relations with European leaders and especially Merkel will worsen,\u201d said Volodymyr Fesenko of the Penta think tank.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no direct criticism (in the call summary) but the context and tonality is such that Zelenskiy sounds like he\u2019s complaining about Merkel to Trump.\u201d\n\nSome Ukrainians fear that the damage the Trump scandal could inflict on U.S.-Ukraine ties could also play into Russia\u2019s hands as it might imperil future U.S. military aid among other things.\n\n\u201cFor Ukraine there\u2019s a huge danger that it could find itself alone with its enemy the Russian Federation ... as the United States is a strategic partner in the military sphere and when it comes to pushing ahead with reforms,\u201d said Maria Ionova, a lawmaker from former president Petro Poroshenko\u2019s faction.\n\n\u201cThe Russian Federation will definitely use this chance.\u201d\n\nThe Kremlin has said the matter is one for the United States and Ukraine and that it is merely observing.\n\nA view shows the presidential administration headquarters in Kiev, Ukraine September 25, 2019. REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko\n\n\u201c(The) facts are that Trump in effect asks Zelenskiy to dig dirt up on Biden, and Zelenskiy seemingly agreed,\u201d Ash said.\n\n\u201cAfter everything Biden did for the reform story in Ukraine, Zelenskiy stabs him in the back - along with the former U.S. ambassador, Merkel, et al.\n\n\u201cThe winner - Putin!\u201d", "description": "For U.S. President Donald Trump, White House publication on Wednesday of a memo summarising his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy fuelled a domestic political crisis.", "authors": ["Pavel Polityuk", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433906500&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O254", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
