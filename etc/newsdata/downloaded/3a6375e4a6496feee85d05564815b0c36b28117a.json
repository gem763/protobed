(Submitted by Robert Talisse)\n\nThese depictions signal that the people on the other side \"aren't even worth listening to, because the views that they have are so 'extreme and crazy,' there couldn't be any profitable reasoning with them.\"\n\n\"These strategies are fundamentally anti-democratic. They're tyrannical, they're fascistic. They are the kinds of strategies that lead us to accept a politics based on the idea that there is no such thing as reasonable disagreement.\"\n\nCoffee clash\n\nThe echo chambers we inhabit go beyond the online realm and into everyday life, physically separating us from those with political views different than ours, says Talisse.\n\nConsumer choices \u2014 even where we get our morning coffee \u2014 skew politically, he adds, and contribute to our estrangement from political opponents.\n\nAmericans who frequent Starbucks, says Talisse, tend to be on the more liberal side, while those with conservative leanings tend to prefer Dunkin' Donuts.\n\nThat even the coffee we choose is caught up in our hyper-politicized world is only one indication of just how much politics has permeated our lives.\n\nCivility is a matter of addressing the other side's \u2026 reasons in a way that gives them a fair hearing. - Robert Talisse\n\nAlong with the online echo chambers, it all turns us into extremist versions of ourselves, who are more likely to be dismissive of our political adversaries\u2014again making for unproductive argument, say Aikin and Talisse.\n\n\"We radicalize in contexts where we're surrounded only by like-minded others,\" he explained.\n\n\"We become less likely to listen to the arguments of the people on the other side, and by the way these are empirical results and they're very, very robust.\"\n\n'Overdoing democracy'\n\nIn this age of intense polarization, Talisse argues, we have allowed politics to dominate our lives to an extent that we are \"overdoing democracy.\"\n\n\"It is possible to enact our roles as citizens to such an extent that we crowd out of our social lives all the other bases on which we might build valuable relationships together,\" says Talisse.\n\nIn doing so, he adds, we come to see one another \"exhaustively and exclusively\" as citizens who are either allies or rivals.\n\n\"Not only do we crowd out other good things in our lives we do but we also crowd out other good things in our lives that democracy needs in order for it to flourish.\"\n\nThe answer, Aikin and Talisse say, is in finding civic activities and conversations where politics is besides the point \u2014everyday situations where common ground may be discovered and established.\n\nThe answer may also be found in reaffirming that family gatherings like Thanksgiving, for example, have a much higher purpose than arguing about politics \u2014-a dreaded tradition.\n\nCivility is key\n\nAnd how to make debate great again?\n\nCivility is key \u2014 but in Aikin's and Talisse's view, that doesn't mean \"polite.\"\n\n\"Civility is a matter of addressing the other side's \u2026 reasons in a way that gives them a fair hearing,\" says Talisse.\n\nGood debate also requires the ability to assess argument \u2014 and reasons for an argument \u2014 independently of whether an opponent's conclusion is correct, they say.\n\nAikin says given the fractious political environment in today's democracies, the best that can be hoped for is finding spaces where people who strive to argue well can do so \u2014 including university classrooms, public forums both online and off, and in everyday conversation, even in a line to grab a coffee.\n\nAikin says \"It requires us as individuals to kind of reach out and be better than ourselves.\"", "description": "There's been a lot of hand-wringing about the threat to liberal democracy from foreign agencies. But much less so about what's undermining democracy from within. American Philosophers Robert Talisse and Scott Aikin believe it is the simulated nature of political argument and disagreement that is eating away at democracy, creating democratic dysfunction.
