Photo: Andrew Harnik/AP/Shutterstock\n\nA couple of years ago, the actor Seth Rogen realized, to his amusement and slight alarm, that Donald Trump Jr. was following him on Twitter. His reaction was completely sane:\n\nLet's see if this works! pic.twitter.com/q5b3d8U4Nx \u2014 Seth Rogen (@Sethrogen) February 16, 2017\n\nOne of the more demoralizing aspects of the Trump presidency has been the sense of helplessness it has fostered. The man can confess to crimes on-camera, have rock-bottom approval ratings, be the world\u2019s increasingly distressing joke in every imaginable fashion, but yet \u2026 he\u2019s still here, and he\u2019s still in charge. We can protest, we can organize, we can rally, we can #resist, and while all those things are (obviously) vital, they don\u2019t provide the cathartic satisfaction that it feels like simply rolling up your sleeves yourself and Doing Something, Dammit, would. You want to just scream in the guy\u2019s face, right? This is what Rogen was getting at. He can Tweet and rally and make mildly (but only mildly) political movies about the current situation, but there\u2019s nothing like saying something directly to one of the people who are making this nightmare happen. Cutting through all the people paid to stand in our way and letting them know exactly how you and so many others think might not make a difference \u2026 but it can feel like it. I went through something similar when I learned Kellyanne Conway was inexplicably following me on Twitter. I sent her several direct messages myself, politely asking her to please stop destroying everything. I know it didn\u2019t do anything \u2014 I did not hear back from Kellyanne! \u2014 but, you know, you gotta do something.\n\nI thought a lot about Seth Rogen and Kellyanne Conway and this oppressive helplessness while watching game five of the World Series, at which 50,000 or so Washington Nationals fans, upon seeing President Donald Trump on the big screen, booed him with the strength of a thousand suns.\n\nPresident Trump booed loudly when introduced to the crowd in the third inning at Game 5 of the #WorldSeries2019 pic.twitter.com/pLstOthT2h \u2014 Scott Boeck (@ScottBoeck) October 28, 2019\n\nPerhaps most amusing about this booing was how the Nationals anticipated it, tried to work around it, and ultimately only accentuated it. The \u201cWave Your Caps\u201d segment before Trump came on is a regular feature at Nationals game as a way to salute the military, as is the requisite \u201cThank You for Your Service\u201d that followed it. The hope clearly was that fans would be so busy applauding servicemen and servicewomen that the applause would bleed into Trump\u2019s appearance. But all this did was emphasize how dramatic the shift to boos became when Trump appeared on-screen \u2026 and then how everyone immediately went back to cheering when more servicepeople appeared. It was unmistakable. And I will not lie to you: I think I have watched this exact scene from about 50 different angles at this point. It\u2019s a heady time.\n\nIt is not unusual for a politician to be booed at a sporting event. It sort of comes with the job description. Every politician is booed when shown at a sporting event. It happened to George W. Bush, it happened to Obama, it happened to Dick Cheney, it happened to Sarah Palin (at a hockey game!), it even happened to Michelle Obama and Jill Biden (at a NASCAR event). There are some places a Democratic president might be booed a little louder than a Republican one, and vice versa (though that shouldn\u2019t be overstated; here are thousands of southern college football fans booing Trump in Atlanta when he was shown on the jumbotron at the National Championship game two years ago), but on the whole: If you go to a game and you are a public officeholder, you are going to get booed. That Trump would be surprised by this is not surprising, but nothing else about it should be.\n\nIt still felt great, didn\u2019t it? One can, if one wishes, have a Joe Scarborough\u2013esque debate about the relative appropriateness of chanting \u201cLock him up\u201d at Trump (it would seem to me that chanting \u201cLock him up\u201d at Trump is a bit different from yelling \u201cLock her up\u201d at Hillary Clinton considering the former is under investigation for dozens of crimes and in fact invented the very chant being used against him, while the latter isn\u2019t and didn\u2019t, but what do I know? I don\u2019t have a political television show) yet still appreciate that tens of thousands of people took advantage of the unique opportunity to let Trump know what they think of him in front of the entire world, right? As the Washington Post pointed out, emphasized by ABC News\u2019 Karen Travers, game five was the rare moment in which Trump was in a public place that wasn\u2019t the White House, a federal building, or an edifice that he owns (or has his name on). He stuck his head out of the hole and faced the world naked for a moment, and the world instantaneously let him know how it felt about him. They could not have coordinated it any better.\n\nIt reminded me, as a Knicks fan, of James Dolan. Dolan famously hasn\u2019t been publicly introduced at Madison Square Garden at a Knicks game \u2014 he owns the building and the team \u2014 in more than a decade, and with absolutely good reason: The minute his name was announced, the boos would be so overpowering there\u2019d be nothing left of him but a guitar pick signed by Glenn Frey and a few strands of hair. So he hides. Dolan, like Trump, appears only in places where he can personally control the audience and the message. Along with his all-encompassing awfulness (like Trump), this has led to a buildup of vitriol that must eventually be released. In many ways, game five was the perfect storm of Trump booing: weeks of hiding from anyone but his most loyal supporters; a month of reveals of his boorish, criminal behavior; ten seconds of angry fans (whose team was about to lose its third game in three nights) having the opportunity to vent their spleen; and his general obliviousness as to how this was going to turn out. We may never again have forces align for such a pure, unadulterated display of revulsion.\n\nTrump may be in office for another year or so, or less than that, or, God forbid, five (or more!) years. But here\u2019s a safe bet: He\u2019ll never appear at another sporting event like that again. Even if Trump were popular, he\u2019d be booed at games he attended. But as underwater as he is? A reception like last night\u2019s will await him wherever he may go. And the rest of the world sees this. I had several overseas friends tell me this morning how relieved they were to see him treated that way, particularly by the primarily white and older baseball fan base. People have so few real opportunities to tell him how they feel about him in a way he absolutely cannot deny. The World Series and sports in general give us that chance. So boo. Boo until you cannot boo any longer. And then boo some more. It might not make a difference. But dammit, it can\u2019t hurt.\n\nUpon waking today, take a breath as deep as your lungs will allow and begin the booing. When the breath runs out or the effort becomes too tiring, consider a handheld Bluetooth speaker through which a loop of unending booing can be streamed. \u2014 \ud83d\udc80Arby\u2019s Runs Out Of The Meats\ud83d\udc80 (@marklisanti) October 28, 2019\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.
