Right now, you can get a new Lenovo 15-inch laptop for an impressively affordable $179.99\u2014 which is $120 off its normal price.\n\nThere are a few things that make this a great laptop for the price. For starters, while the laptop may not be the most powerful out there, it's pretty good for a laptop in this price range, offering an Intel Pentium 2.3GHz processor, coupled with 4GB of RAM and 500GB of storage \u2014 which should be more than enough storage for most. The display on the laptop comes in at 15.6 inches, and it has a resolution of 1,366 x 768. It also comes with a 30-day trial of Microsoft Office 365.\n\nThe laptop isn't bad-looking either. It comes in a sleek black color, and measures in at 0.78 inches thick, which is actually very slim. Around the edges, you'll get two USB 2.0 ports and two USB-C ports, along with a headphone jack and a HDMI port to connect the device to external displays. The laptop comes with Windows 10 S, which is the lighter-weight version of Windows 10, and has a battery life of 5.5 hours on a single charge.", "description": "This Lenovo laptop already comes at a reasonable price, but for a limited time you can save even more at Best Buy.
