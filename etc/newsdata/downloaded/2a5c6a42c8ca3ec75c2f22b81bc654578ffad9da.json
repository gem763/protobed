The question is: is it one that she\u2019ll be able to refuse?\n\nEver since Phil (Steve McFadden) attempted to stop her from arranging Hunter\u2019s funeral, Mel has been hellbent on bringing the Mitchells down, and \u2014 since discovering her secret affair with Keanu (Danny Walters) \u2014 Sharon has become her primary target.\n\nThe Mitchell matriarch has been off in Portugal trying to acquire a villa for her, but \u2014 in the coming episodes \u2014 she returns home, which makes it the perfect time for Mel to start causing more trouble for her.\n\nUpon Sharon\u2019s return, Mel invites Ruby to E20 and offers her first refusal to buy the club. Ruby\u2019s taken aback, but she senses that Sharon has doubts about selling, and thus she\u2019s not sure how to proceed. However, Mel reassures the young woman that Sharon definitely will be willing to sell \u2014 something that she\u2019ll no doubt see to personally, as \u2014 later \u2014 she threatens Sharon to do as she says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLater in the week, Ruby discusses Mel\u2019s proposition further, but when she pays Sharon a visit, conflict ensues when the Mitchell matriarch disputes the amount offered on the club.\n\nWill Ruby get the club?\n\nShe certainly seems keen, but \u2014 with Mel and Sharon\u2019s feud reaching boiling point \u2014 what Ruby wants is likely the last thing on either of the Walford icons\u2019 minds.\n\nOne to watch: Monday 28th October at 8pm on BBC One.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Is it an offer that she'll be unable to refuse?", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/18730023-low_res-eastenders-october-december-2019-0134_1571226655.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
