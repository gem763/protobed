The firm does not have a price target on the stock.\n\nBut Bernstein's Toni Sacconaghi disagreed that this was a warning sign for Tesla's demand, instead pointing to the company's backlog of orders. Tesla noted as much in its press release about the latest quarterly deliveries, saying that in the third quarter \"nearly all of our Model 3 orders were received from customers who did not previously hold a reservation, solidifying the transition to generating strong organic demand.\"", "description": "JMP Securities lowered its rating on Tesla's stock to market perform from market outperform.", "authors": ["Michael Sheetz"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105997474-1561999876863gettyimages-1010166584.jpeg?v=1561999891"}
