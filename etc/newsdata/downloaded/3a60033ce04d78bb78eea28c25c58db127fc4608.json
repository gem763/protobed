His attorney said that would block Trump from being arrested and charged even if he followed through on his campaign trail claim: \u201cI could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and wouldn\u2019t lose any voters, okay?\u201d\n\nAttorney William Consovoy argued that New York authorities would have to wait until the president was out of office to arrest and charge him for that crime. The DA's office argued the claim was a fabrication.\n\n\u201cOnce a president is removed from office, any local authority\u201d could prosecute him, Consovoy told a panel of three judges from the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals. \u201cThis is not a permanent immunity.\u201d\n\nJudge Denny Chin pressed him on how the crime would be handled while Trump remained in office. \u201cNothing could be done, that\u2019s your position?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat is correct,\u201d Consovoy replied.\n\nThe Manhattan DA subpoenaed eight years of Trump\u2019s tax returns from his accounting firm, Mazars USA, as part of a probe into hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels in exchange for her silence about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nFederal Judge Victor Marrero threw out Trump\u2019s suit seeking to block the subpoena, finding his \u201cextraordinary\u201d claim to be immune from criminal investigation was not supported by the law.\n\nTrump appealed, and the subpoena was put on hold as the case is heard. The sides made oral arguments Wednesday before the 2nd Circuit.\n\nThe case is expected to ultimately make its way to the Supreme Court. Trump\u2019s attorneys and the DA\u2019s office made an agreement that if Trump loses in the appeals court, Vance will hold off on enforcing the subpoena as long as Trump makes his appeal to the Supreme Court within 10 days.\n\n\u201cWe view the entire subpoena as an inappropriate fishing expedition not made in good faith,\u201d Consovoy told the judges.\n\n\u201cEverything we\u2019ve heard this morning makes clear the president is a target,\u201d he said. \u201cThe district attorney just wants the president\u2019s tax returns.\u201d\n\nUnlike past presidents, Trump has adamantly refused to make his tax returns public.\n\nCarey Dunne, general counsel for the Manhattan DA, said the privilege the president\u2019s lawyers are claiming is not founded in the law.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as presidential immunity for tax returns,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHe may view them as embarrassing or sensitive but tax returns do in fact get subpoenaed all the time in financial investigations,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re making this up, your honor.\u201d", "description": "Unlike past presidents, Trump has adamantly refused to make his tax returns public.", "authors": ["Erin Durkin"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/31/a4/49dc67b140d69a4f51a5580cedff/courtofappealspano-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
