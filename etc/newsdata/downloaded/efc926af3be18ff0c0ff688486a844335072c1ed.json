The result is sobering, IMF officials say.\n\nA total of $19 trillion of debt would be owed by firms that could not cover interest costs from their earnings.\n\nThat is almost 40% of corporate debt in the economies concerned, which include the US, China and some European economies.\n\nIn addition, the ultra-low interest rates have encouraged investors such as pension funds and insurance companies to seek riskier, but more lucrative assets.\n\nLow interest rates in the developed world have also led to more money going to emerging economies, where debts are building. If interest rates were to rise, it would be harder for them to keep up their debt payments.\n\nDownturn fears\n\nAnother problem with the ultra-low interest rate policy - noted in the IMF' s assessment of the general economic outlook - is that it leaves central banks with limited options to tackle a downturn.\n\nSo attention has turned to government finances or fiscal policy. The IMF's assessment of that area is that countries whose government finances are in good shape should use their budgets to support demand for goods and services.\n\nGermany is widely seen as the obvious example of a country that could do this. The government has a budget surplus - it is spending less than it collects in taxes, and has done every year since 2012.\n\nThe country's economy has been hit by the global trade tensions and it might well be in recession. The government is, however, reluctant to open the spending tap, partly perhaps because the unemployment rate is one of the lowest in the world.\n\nIn many other economies, however, the IMF says public debt and interest burdens are high and rising. These countries need to follow prudent policies, it adds.\n\nIf there is a severe downturn, though, the IMF says countries should be prepared for co-ordinated action.", "description": "In its latest economic assessments, the IMF says risks to global financial stability remain high.", "authors": ["Andrew Walker", "Bbc World Service Economics Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/A5E1/production/_109256424_stocks_afp.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
