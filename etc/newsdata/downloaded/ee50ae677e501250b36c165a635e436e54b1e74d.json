Shares of Facebook fell as much as 2.4% on the news.\n\nThe multistate investigation was first announced in September with participation from seven other states, but it has since expanded considerably. The probe will zero in on Facebook's dominance in the social media industry and whether it broke any state or federal laws as a result of any anticompetitive conduct related to that dominance.\n\n\"After continued bipartisan conversations with attorneys general from around the country, today I am announcing that we have vastly expanded the list of states, districts, and territories investigating Facebook for potential antitrust violations,\" James said in a statement. \"Our investigation now has the support of 47 attorneys general from around the nation, who are all concerned that Facebook may have put consumer data at risk, reduced the quality of consumers' choices, and increased the price of advertising. As we continue our investigation, we will use every investigative tool at our disposal to determine whether Facebook's actions stifled competition and put users at risk.\"\n\nIt comes as Facebook already faces a separate antitrust investigation by the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nAttorneys general from Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming, and the territory of Guam are all joining the probe, in addition to other states that can't confirm their participation in the investigation, according to the announcement.\n\nThis is breaking news.
