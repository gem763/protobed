What they have done to deserve this one cannot know. \u201cThe more the EU think that Brexit could be stopped, that Britain could be kept in, by parliament, the less likely we are to give us the deal that we need,\u201d he said.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIt is hard to calibrate whether he managed to keep a straight face. It is, after all, a face whose natural state is an entitled smirk, and one that is itself a joke all over the world.\n\nIt is not so hard to imagine what other European leaders will make of this piece of political positioning so laughable it would embarrass a toddler.\n\nHere was Britain\u2019s actual prime minister, the figurehead of its parliamentary system, patiently explaining that the only way to stop this rather irritating parliament from doing what it has every possible right to do, was to do as he has done, and kick it out.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Oh Mr Johnson, it is serious. But not in the way you imagine.\n\nThere was, mystifyingly, nothing about the need for a new Queen\u2019s speech, to \u201cget on with our exciting domestic agenda\u201d.\n\nThat was Wednesday\u2019s lie, which must be a bit awkward, for say, his international development ministers, Grant Shapps, who were both still sticking to it on air on Friday morning, long after Johnson had stopped bothering.\n\nIf they think we don\u2019t need a deal, they\u2019ll give us the deal we need. He\u2019s really sticking to this. Lucky for us, of course, none of them can ever hear us over in Brussels. We\u2019ve all known that for years now.\n\nLucky for us, too, that none of them can see that our economy shrank in the last quarter, and that at the point at which we leave the European Union we will, as an almost racing certainty, be in recession.\n\nAnd lucky for us also, that when the government\u2019s analysis on how there will be food shortages, medicine shortages, rising food prices and an inevitable return to a hard border in Ireland is splashed all over the front of the newspapers, they can\u2019t see that either.\n\nThey can only hear the denials, which also turn out to be lies.\n\nAt this stage, Johnson had a dire warning for his House of Commons adversaries. \u201cIf we frustrate that mandate, if we fail to leave on 31 October, if that\u2019s what parliamentarians end up doing, it will do lasting damage to people\u2019s trust in politics,\u201d he said.\n\nOh, Prime Minister. Lasting damage, to people\u2019s trust in politics? You are a walking billboard for it. You are the damage.\n\nThe damage that comes from, just to take two recent examples, saying, \u201cI am not attracted to antiquated ideas like proroguing parliament.\u201d The damage from choosing those words with surgical precision, so that people can be conned into believing one thing, but that also leave you free, on a technicality, of the accusation of bare-faced lying when you go ahead and do it anyway, as was always your intent.\n\nOr, when you say, the chances of no-deal Brexit are \u201ca million to one\u201d, long after your Brexit strategy is fully formulated, and one that comes with a risk of no deal that is, by your own admission, 50-50.\n\nStill, he finished with the most grandiose promise of all. If Brexit doesn\u2019t happen, on 31 October, \u201cThis political generation won\u2019t be forgiven.\u201d\n\nTo which the only answer is, come on. This political generation will never be forgiven. Its crimes are already too grave, its base competencies too staggeringly low.\n\nIt is almost endearing to even think of them as a \u201cpolitical generation\u201d. Like the Mark and Michelle era of EastEnders or the third Sugababes line-up.\n\nThere is really no analogy out there to do them justice. Even the Swindon Town team of 1993-4 won a few matches.\n\nThis generation of politicians will be remembered in much the same way as the victorious Spanish basketball team of the Sydney Paralympics. The ones who won an unlikely gold, but were subsequently stripped of their medals once it was discovered they had all been lying about being disabled in the first place.\n\nThat was 19 years ago. It is fair to say none of them have been forgiven quite yet. Johnson\u2019s wait for redemption will be a lot longer than that. He will not live to see the day.", "description": "Another day, another three-minute television interview from the prime minister and down we all go, yet further in to the white-hot centre of the bulls***\u00a0universe.
