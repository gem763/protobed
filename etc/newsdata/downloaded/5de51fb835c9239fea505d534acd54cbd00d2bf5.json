The company, whose chips power smartphones, computers and networking equipment, is a major supplier to Apple (AAPL.O).\n\nThe Commission said Broadcom has 30 days to comply with the order, which is valid for up to three years, an estimate of how long the EU investigation will take.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nThe EU regulator said certain provisions in the deals with six of its major customers are likely to cause serious and irreparable harm to the competition as well as affect future tenders related to the introduction of WiFi 6 standard for modems and TV set-top boxes.\n\nThe competition enforcer\u2019s concerns center on Broadcom\u2019s deals with six TV set-top box and modem makers which result in the companies buying various chips exclusively or almost exclusively from the company.\n\nContentious practices include tying rebates or other benefits to exclusive or minimum-purchase requirements. Reuters reported on Oct. 4 that the Commission would order Broadcom to suspend these practices.", "description": "U.S. chipmaker Broadcom has been ordered to halt exclusivity deals with six TV and modem makers for up to three years while EU antitrust enforcers investigate whether these agreements are aimed at thwarting rivals.", "authors": ["Foo Yun Chee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441427381&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F0PY", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
