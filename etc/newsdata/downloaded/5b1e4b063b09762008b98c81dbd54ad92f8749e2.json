New mysteries are developing, cliffhangers and answers are hitting us at an eye-popping pace, and there\u2019s still time for the show\u2019s signature courtroom cases.\n\nTo kick things off, Michaela is taking over class for the day (Connor rightfully surmises it\u2019s because she guilt-tripped Annalise about her dad). Professor Pratt is taking no prisoners, lining up a dizzying array of charges on the board and asking her peers to come up with ways to dismiss them in a competition to be her second chair. Ultimately, the biggest issue is that the government wants to charge the client, Brandi, for restitution \u2014 and Michaela vows to get them to drop every single dollar.\n\nBut Gabriel is more interested in confronting Michaela about spilling the beans on his murderous deeds. She blames Asher, which Asher is only too happy to take the credit for before telling Gabriel, \u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d Oh, so then this was never about Asher genuinely trying to help Annalise? It was just a way to get his girl back. Harumph.\n\nBonnie is looking for employment at Caplan & Gold, but Tegan immediately smells a rat and accuses her of being a spy for Nate. Plus, Tegan knows she got fired, despite Bonnie\u2019s age-old line that she \u201cresigned\u201d because of everything that happened with Ron. But Tegan wasn\u2019t wrong because Bonnie is texting Nate telling him, \u201cShe knew.\u201d\n\nTegan is busy fielding calls from Connor, who is distraught that Marisol, the undocumented immigrant from last week\u2019s episode, isn\u2019t coming to their meeting because she was worried about being fired. Connor makes an impromptu decision to drive Hector to see his mom in Maryland, but since he\u2019s crossing state lines that\u2019s tantamount to kidnapping (which Asher points out). But Connor thinks it\u2019s worth it when he witnesses the emotional reunion between mother and son \u2014 until ICE agents tipped off by Hector\u2019s social worker show up and detain both of them.\n\nFrank has information about Laurel\u2019s disappearance, and for some reason confides in Oliver?! Wait, when did these two become besties? He reveals the details about the safe deposit box, adding that he believes Laurel was the one who emptied it out since he has a photo of someone who looks like her from a street camera on the night in question.\n\nOliver helps Frank figure out who the driver of Laurel\u2019s cab was, one Felix Michel. But not before Frank admits he\u2019s embarrassed to reveal to everyone he was wrong about Laurel. Oliver wants to know why Frank chose her in the first place, because he always assumed Frank and Bonnie were secretly together at some point. Frank takes the address and confronts the cab driver, offering him a bribe to confirm he drove Laurel and provide any information. But the guy insists he doesn\u2019t remember anything.\n\nMichaela gets her client her day in court. Brandi is facing charges related to burglary, but the incident also resulted in her unarmed black husband\u2019s death after being shot by a police officer. So it\u2019s a loaded case in many ways. The prosecution is offering a plea deal for three years in jail and restitution. Michaela argues that the restitution violates the eighth amendment, which gets the prosecution to lower the total, making $60,000 their final offer. Annalise tells her to take the win, but Michaela and the client won\u2019t do it. They reject the plea offer and threaten to take the case to trial, which backfires when the prosecution tries to add felony murder to the charges.\n\nVivian also makes an appearance in court and corners Annalise in the hallway. Annalise throws in her face that she got Gabriel off when the FBI framed him for terrorism, which makes Vivian beg for Gabriel. \u201cYou of all people know what it feels like to lose your child,\u201d she tells Annalise because of course Sam told her about the baby. He called her right after it happened. SERIOUSLY, THIS DUDE WAS THE WORST.\n\nAnnalise doesn\u2019t take this news well, running home to beat a pillow with a poker. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my fault,\u201d she proclaims. \u201cI loved him.\u201d She says it over and over \u2014 though it\u2019s unclear if she means her son or Sam \u2014 until she\u2019s on her knees, crying and clutching the pillow to her.\n\nMichaela is certain the prosecution is using the murder charge to get back at her, but Gabriel wants to put Brandi on the stand. Police shot her unarmed black husband, so he wants to take advantage of what the press might make of it. Michaela thinks Brandi can\u2019t handle it, and Asher supports her. But Tegan just wants to know where Annalise is and why she has to clean up all her messes.", "description": "'How to Get Away With Murder' recap: Season 6, Episode 3", "authors": ["Maureen Lee Lenker"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/SP3eqBAL_0jgusnNmPAZzQ--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MjcwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/entertainment_weekly_785/9ccd3fd77786be2da23ada9a36c8da3c", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
