But the victory, 22 seasons after the franchise was founded as an expansion team, was truly a team effort, made all the sweeter coming after the years of disappointment and missed opportunities. Or, as Mike Thibault, coach and general manager, described it, \u201ca pretty desperate time here.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMr. Thibault was hired in December 2012 to turn things around, and the team\u2019s success shows what a well-run franchise can deliver. Credit to owner Ted Leonsis \u2014 whose Washington Capitals ended a major pro sports drought with its 2018 Stanley Cup win \u2014 for hiring good people, letting them do the hard work of building a team and, perhaps even more importantly, recognizing the responsibility to be a good member of the community. This was the first year the team played in a new arena in Ward 8, an often neglected part of the city, and Mystics officials and team members have said they hope their presence and involvement in the neighborhood will help bring about change.\n\nNo question that Thursday\u2019s victory got attention. \u201cCongrats to the @WashMystics on a gutsy, first-ever championship!,\u201d tweeted former president Barack Obama. \u201cA great team performance when it counted. If folks aren\u2019t careful, this title thing might become a habit in DC.\u201d With the Washington Nationals advancing in the playoffs, we \u2014 fingers crossed \u2014 hope Mr. Obama is on to something.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "D.C.\u2019s team earns its first WNBA championship and gives the capital area new champions to celebrate.", "authors": ["Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/VIqYp9gkQMMWQJmr2ZPFMSmi4gQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5UBKPAXLZUI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
