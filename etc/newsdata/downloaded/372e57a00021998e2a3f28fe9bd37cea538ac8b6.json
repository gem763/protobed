Not sure how that\u2019s going to sound.\u2019\n\nBut despite the mother-of-three saying that she\u2019d \u2018rather give birth again with no drugs than do this\u2019 (yikes), Phoebe arrived to the recording session at the iconic Abbey Road Studios and insisted Olivia had nothing to worry about.\n\n\u2018I first knew that Olivia could sing at karaoke because she\u2019s one of those dark horses that is just sort of like, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t really, I don\u2019t really,\u201d but then she does and she brings it and just burns the place down.\u2019\n\nPWB had some great stories about Olivia\u2019s karaoke habits (Picture: BBC)\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been a dream to support her musically, with her first ever single, I think.\u2019\n\nUs, jealous? At the idea of Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Olivia Colman doing karaoke together? Yeah right\u2026\n\nOlivia got her confidence back with Phoebe\u2019s help (Picture: BBC)\n\nReuniting in the studio, Olivia gave the girls the biggest hugs, melting our hearts in the process and leaving us desperate for another series (maybe one where Fleabag and the Godmother are secretly best friends?).\n\nAnd the recording team were impressed by how at ease Phoebe let Olivia feel, commenting: \u2018Olivia\u2019s singing well, isn\u2019t she? She\u2019s very relaxed.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat a transformation!\n\nChildren In Need: Got It Covered is available to purchase on Friday 1 November.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
