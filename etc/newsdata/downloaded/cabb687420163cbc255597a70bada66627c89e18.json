President Trump and Democrats should put aside differences to boost infrastructure investment and modernize cities and rural technology.\n\nThe economy is adding jobs at a slowing pace, and cutting interest rates won\u2019t do much to accelerate investment, because businesses are pixilated about the outcome of the trade war \u2014 new opportunities in China vs. stalemate and diversion of supply-chains to Mexico and Asia.\n\nMore tax cuts to encourage consumer spending would add to the deficit, imports and foreign borrowing but do little to build a more competitive America. Roads, bridges and ports are straining to handle commuters and move goods, and the U.S. Internet is in danger of falling behind the Chinese.\n\nDemocrats and Mr. Trump can argue the causes of climate change, but no one looking at the recent severity of storms can doubt our coastal metropolises need hardening. Rural telecom carriers need assistance to wean from Huawei and ZTE equipment and build out 5G.\n\nFederal and state governments spend about $450 billion a year or roads, bridges, mass transit, waterways and the like. That should be increased by at least $200 billion to catch decaying and crowded facilities and address climate change abatement and 5G.\n\nInadequate facilities are imposing economic losses of at least $400 billion a year and more than 1 million jobs \u2014 more than what is needed in additional spending on repairs and upgrades.\n\nU.S. fatalities per mile driven are about 40 percent greater than those in Canada and double those in Sweden, which is viewed as having the safest roads in the world.\n\nFederal agencies like the Army Corps of Engineers, and state and local governments have backlogs of projects. The trick is not to tie them up with federal approvals or let environmental groups impede progress through the courts.\n\nWashington is inclined to micromanage by allocating money to specific purposes, playing into the hands of bureaucrats, empire builders and activists \u2014 who universally delay worthy investments to justify their existence.\n\nTo give the economy a quick boost and do good for the long run, it would be better to simply appropriate an additional $200 billion annually in proportion to present allocations among states and agencies. Don\u2019t earmark projects but instead require that the funds be spent within the year received \u2014 and audit projects for integrity in bidding and the like. Then, funds for projects held up by the courts would be diverted to other worthy purposes.\n\nAll of this boils down to how to pay.\n\nLast raised in 1993, the gas tax is 18.3 cents per gallon and is supplemented by a 24.3 cents diesel tax \u2014 those provide about $40 billion of the nearly $60 billon the Federal Highway Trust Fund spends, with Congress providing supplemental money from other sources. About 28 percent of the fuel taxes are diverted to mass transit, bike paths and other noble purposes.\n\nAfter years of inflation and with oil prices so low, doubling those taxes, requiring higher transit fees and excise taxes on bicycles, tires and recreational equipment could add another $50 billion to what can be spent.\n\nSen. Chuck Schumer, whose will the president cannot ignore, won\u2019t consider higher gas taxes without repealing some of the 2017 tax reductions for high-income households. Like it or not, that\u2019s where another $50 billion has to be found.\n\nThe other $100 billion can be borrowed because the boost to GDP from $200 billion in spending on cement, bulldozers and Internet routers should be about $250 billion. That would generate a lot of taxes, so in the end the increase in the deficit would be much less than $100 billion.\n\nLast spring, congressional Democrats endorsed a $2 trillion, multiyear package \u2014 roughly in line with the amount proposed here. President Trump initially agreed to look for a way forward but then said he would not negotiate on these issues while the congressional investigation into Russian influence continues.\n\nThe economy is at a genuine risk of recession \u2014 and that poses more of a threat to the president\u2019s re-election than the machinations of Russia conspiracy zealots like Rep. Adam Schiff.\n\nMr. Trump would be well advised to advocate an immediate infrastructure package as necessary to avoid an economic downturn and unemployment, challenge Sen. Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to cooperate and put the onus on them if the package is not passed and the economy tanks.\n\n\u2022 Peter Morici is an economist and business professor at the University of Maryland, and a national columnist.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
