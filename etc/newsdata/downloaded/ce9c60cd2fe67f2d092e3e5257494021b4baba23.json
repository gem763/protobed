There is no other plausible explanation,\u201d a statement by the three leaders said.\n\nWith Johnson laying the blame on Iran earlier in the day, it was the first time Paris and Berlin had done so.\n\nThe three countries said they remained committed to the 2015Iran nuclear deal, but demanded that Tehran return to full compliance after reneging on some of its commitments.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to continuing our diplomatic efforts to create conditions and facilitate dialog with all relevant partners interested in de-escalation of tensions in the MiddleEast,\u201d they said.
