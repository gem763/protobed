Day was alone in third place.\n\nDay is hoping Els will chose him as a captain\u2019s pick for the International team against the Tiger Woods-captained U.S. side in December at Royal Melbourne.\n\n\u201cIt is certainly disappointing not to make the team on my own merits. But it is a reminder that nothing is given to you in this game,\u201d Day said ahead of his first round.\n\n\u201cI certainly want to be on the team and believe I can be an asset to the Internationals. Being in my home country certainly gives me an edge and I\u2019ve had some success on the sandbelt (courses) and Royal Melbourne in the past.\u201d\n\nDefending champion Brooks Koepka shot a 69 Thursday with an eagle on the 18th, his final hole, Last year\u2019s runner-up Gary Woodland had a 71.\n\nJustin Thomas, who won the inaugural 2017 CJ Cup, shot 68 and Phil Mickelson and Jordan Spieth each shot 70. Spieth is looking to end a lengthy drought - he hasn\u2019t won since the 2017 British Open at Royal Birkdale, a span of 54 tournaments worldwide.\n\nKevin Na, who won in a playoff in Las Vegas two weeks ago, had a 72 and Sergio Garcia 73.\n\nThere are 78 players are in the no-cut, limited-field event.\n\nNo. 1-ranked Koepka stirred some controversy on Wednesday when he pointed out that Rory McIlroy, his closest challenger for the top ranking, hasn\u2019t won a major since the American joined the PGA Tour in 2015. He was responding to a question about a rivalry between the pair.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not looking at anybody behind me. I\u2019m No.1 number one in the world,\u201d Koepka said. \u201cI\u2019ve got open road in front of me I\u2019m not looking in the rearview mirror, so I don\u2019t see it as a rivalry. I\u2019ve been out here for, what, five years. Rory hasn\u2019t won a major since I\u2019ve been on the PGA Tour.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP golf: https://apnews.com/apf-Golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jason Day's attempt to impress International team captain Ernie Els for a spot at the Presidents Cup took a positive turn on Thursday when the Australian shot a 6-under 66 to sit two strokes off the lead after the opening round of the CJ Cup at Nine Bridges.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/15/golf_notes_golf_56861_c0-76-1828-1142_s1200x700.jpg?c654323984806fd2c3ede06d00d326b01de1ea6e", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
