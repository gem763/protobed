(Carlos Barria/Reuters)\n\nThe U.S. government awarded three separate contracts Monday to construct approximately 65 miles of new border wall in the Rio Grande Valley, according to a statement from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nThe three contracts, totaling in value at just over $812 million, are for a brand-new wall segment, consisting of an 18-30 foot wall, lighting, cameras, and other surveillance technology.\n\nAccording to the statement, the Rio Grand Valley \u201cis the busiest Sector in the nation and accounts for approximately 40% of the illegal alien apprehensions.\u201d The region, known for its rough terrain and limited access, also ranks first in cocaine and marijuana busts along the southwest border for the fiscal year.\n\nThe statement also announced that the projects will not be under the umbrella of President Trump\u2019s National Emergency Declaration, and will not come from Department of Defense funding.\n\nThe news comes as lawmakers on both sides of the aisle began to resist Trump\u2019s efforts to unilaterally redirect military funds to build a wall on the southern border. Last week, the Senate, including 11 Republicans, voted to cancel the president\u2019s emergency declaration distinction and, on Friday, moved the bill to Trump\u2019s desk, where it is expected to be vetoed. Congress passed a similar resolution rebuking Trump in March, which the president subsequently vetoed.", "description": "The contracts, totaling just over $812 million, are for a new wall segment, consisting of an 18-30 foot wall, lighting, cameras, and other surveillance tech.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Andrew C.
