Before the Joshua fight, this was the largest unlicensed audience that Muso had ever tracked for boxing.\n\n\u201cWe saw how popular the Fury vs. Wilder fight was across piracy networks just six months ago and how a significant part of the audience was coming in through YouTube,\u201d Andy Chatterley, CEO of Muso, told The Independent.\n\n\u201cThe Joshua vs Ruiz fight was the largest unauthorised audience that we\u2019ve ever tracked across boxing and it\u2019s staggering to see that 93 per cent of the audience watched via YouTube.\u201d\n\nSeparate research by the Industry for IP Awareness found that a proliferation of methods to watch illegal content had seen sports piracy reach \u201cpeak levels\u201d this year.\n\n\u201cTV, sports and film piracy has reverted to peak levels in 2019,\u201d a spokesperson for the consumer body said. \u201c[Our research] also highlights the very real risks to users of these new methods of piracy.\u201d\n\nCyber security experts have consistently warned of the dangers involved when clicking on unknown links promising free streams to sporting events, with many containing malware and other viruses.\n\nAnyone caught hosting such streams also risks heavy fines for breaking the law.", "description": "Lineal heavyweight champion of the world Tyson Fury is set to face Swedish challenger Otto Wallin\u00a0on Saturday night, in what many boxing fans hope will be a\u00a0stepping stone towards a highly anticipated rematch with WBC champion Deontay Wilder.", "authors": ["Anthony Cuthbertson"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/13/13/tyson-fury-live-stream-whalin-boxing.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
