Show Hide Born in 1976 just outside Moscow, Alexei Navalny is a lawyer-turned-campaigner whose Anti-Corruption Foundation investigates the wealth of Vladimir Putin\u2019s inner circle. He started out as a Russian nationalist, but emerged as the main leader of Russia's democratic opposition during the wave of protests that led up to the 2012 presidential election, and has since been a thorn in the Kremlin\u2019s side. Navalny is barred from appearing on state television, but has used social media to his advantage. A 2017 documentary accusing the prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, of corruption received more than 30m views on YouTube within two months.\n\nHe has been repeatedly arrested and jailed. The European court of human rights ruled that Russia violated Navalny's rights by holding him under house arrest in 2014. Election officials barred him from running for president in 2018 due to an embezzlement conviction that he claims was politically motivated. Navalny told the commission its decision would be a vote 'not against me, but against 16,000 people who have nominated me; against 200,000 volunteers who have been canvassing for me'. There has also been a physical price to pay. In April 2017, he was attacked with green dye that nearly blinded him in one eye, and in July 2019 he was taken from jail to hospital with symptoms that one of his doctors said could indicate poisoning.

He said police had searched more than 200 addresses in 41 cities across Russia.\n\nThe charismatic anti-corruption campaigner instructed supporters to vote strategically to block pro-Kremlin candidates in Moscow\u2019s local election.\n\nAllies of the president, Vladimir Putin, suffered major losses in the Russian capital during the September vote.\n\nNavalny organised the protests after popular opposition politicians were barred from standing in the Moscow parliament election.\n\n\u201cShameless bastards from the Kremlin are seeking revenge for \u2018Smart Voting\u2019 and trying to destroy a network of our offices,\u201d Lyubov Sobol, one of the Navalny allies barred from the vote, said Tuesday on Twitter.", "description": "Kremlin critics denounce searches as attempts to intimidate them", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse In Moscow"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c210a7cf81b010119287e7078afb6f1fda01fc04/0_38_2835_1701/master/2835.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b9435aba4ee7218c23ef4d659bbba3bc", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
