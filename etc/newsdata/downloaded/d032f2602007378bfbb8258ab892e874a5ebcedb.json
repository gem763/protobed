But October should be better and the outlook remains positive for growth sectors of the economy.\n\nThose views come from James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group. In a report out Friday, he argued that stock returns in September are likely to be rough, but that things should pick up in October. He recommended sticking with growth stocks that have done well in this market and should continue to outperform.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re nervous that the recovery is ending, I\u2019d be in defensive stocks and cash,\u201d he said in an interview with Barron\u2019s. \u201cBut until then, \u2018new-era\u2019 growth stocks will lead.\u201d\n\nOver the last 50 years, Paulsen said, the direction of the stock market, bond yields, and M2 Money Supply have all had \u201csignificant bearing\u201d on September stock returns. Two of those indicators are now pointing south.\n\nThe S&P 500 has gained just 3.5% in the last six months (not including a recent bounce taking it to 5%). That\u2019s a below-average performance for such periods leading to September since 1947. And that suggests \u201ca below-average September is on the horizon,\u201d Paulsen wrote in his report.\n\nAnother negative indicator is bond yields. Rising yields over the prior six months has been a bullish indicator for September stock returns, he wrote. But bond yields have plunged in recent months, a bad omen for September.\n\nThe one bright spot is M2 Money Supply, or the amount of money circulating in the economy. Money supply is like the pulse rate of the economy. When it\u2019s rising, it implies more borrowing, spending, and signs of inflation\u2014all things the stock market likes to see (within reason).\n\nHistorically, when money supply increased at an above-average pace, the stock market has responded favorably, Paulsen noted. And M2 has been above average over the last six months. Indeed, Paulsen said, the growth rate in M2 in the last six months have been above average relative to every six month period leading up to September since 1947.\n\nSeptember, of course, has a bad reputation for stock returns. Since 1950, it has been the worst month for the S&P 500, which has fallen an average of 0.5% during the month, Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist for LPL Financial, noted in a blog post. September\u2019s record has been a bit better recently: Over the past 10 years, the S&P 500 has averaged a 0.9% gain in September.\n\nPaulsen pointed out that market returns in September have been slightly negative since 1947. Thus, while M2 appears accommodating, returns \u201cmay be challenged\u201d by the paths of both the S&P 500 and bond yields, Paulsen wrote.\n\nSurprisingly, October should be better. That might seem counterintuitive, given that October has a dismal reputation for stocks. Two of the biggest market crashes (in 1929 and 1987) occurred in October. And according to Wall Street lore, there is an \u201cOctober effect\u201d of stocks declining more than average in the month.\n\nBut that appears to be folklore. Until 1970, the average market return in October was negative, Paulsen wrote, and \u201cwhen paired with September, the two represented the worst months of the year.\u201d But starting in 1970, the average annualized gain in October has been 11.6%, making it the fourth best month of the year.\n\nWhat should investors make of these seasonal effects? If one were to subject them to a rigorous statistical analysis, the answer would probably be not much. Moreover, we are in a volatile political climate with an unpredictable president who can move the markets with a tweet. There\u2019s no historical precedent for that.\n\nNonetheless, Paulsen argues that this isn\u2019t the time to get defensive\u2014yet. Defensive sectors like utilities, consumer staples, and real estate, \u201clook overbought and overvalued,\u201d he said. Investors should use market dips as opportunities to buy relatively cheap cyclical sectors like industrials, materials, and financials, along with emerging markets.\n\nHe also recommends \u201cpopularity\u201d stocks: tech, communication services, and consumer discretionary stocks that should maintain their leadership as long as the bull market lasts.\n\nPaulsen\u2019s rationale is that business investment is increasingly bifurcating between old- and new-era sectors. New-era investment is spending on \u201cinformation-technology processing equipment and intellectual property products.\u201d Old-era investment is non-residential investment in everything else, Paulsen said.\n\nNew-era investment now comprises 54% of total business spending, up from about 40% at the start of the economic recovery, Paulsen said. The trend shows no signs of abating, and even if the economy contracts, new-era investment is likely to keep rising (while investment in old-economy sectors would probably decline).\n\nOne way to capture this theme is with a growth-oriented exchange-traded fund. Paulsen likes the iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (ticker: IVW) as a proxy. Its top holdings include Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon.com (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Visa (V), and Verizon Communications (VZ).\n\nYes, the ETF has an above-average valuation, trading at 22 times estimated 2019 earnings, compared to 17.6 times for the S&P 500. And yes, it has some elements of the so-called FANG tech giants ( Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google parent Alphabet), which have been relatively weak. But Paulsen views the ETF\u2019s multiple as a reasonable price to pay for companies with superior growth and business investment. And he points out that the S&P 500 Information Technology sector has been outperforming this year (up 29%), though it doesn\u2019t include the FANGs anymore.\n\n\u201cIn a world of 1.5% Treasury yields, here you have something with a persistent growth rate that\u2019s two to three times that of the economy overall,\u201d he says. \u201cI worry about valuation, no doubt, but valuation won\u2019t be the cause of a market downturn. Until the recovery is over, this theme will lead, regardless of valuation.\u201d", "description": "When the stock market re-opens for trading on Tuesday after the Labor Day break, it could be the start of a rough month for stocks.
