Pollock led the way in the seven-run inning with a three-run homer.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we do,\u201d Kershaw said of his teammates\u2019 offensive show.\n\nThe NL West champions improved to 14-3 against the Rockies this year, including 7-0 at home. Colorado has dropped 12 straight games at Dodger Stadium, tying Cincinnati for the longest skid at the ballpark.\n\nAt 58-21, the Dodgers have their best home record since the franchise moved to Los Angeles for the 1958 season. They are closing in on their second 100-win season in three years.\n\nKershaw (15-5) put the Dodgers in a 3-0 hole with back-to-back homers to Nolan Arenado and Charlie Blackmon in the first, and an RBI single by Tony Wolters in the second.\n\n\u201cNot a lot of good tonight on my part,\u201d Kershaw said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but need to get better. Got one more (start) to figure it out before things get going.\u201d\n\nKershaw gave up another homer to Garrett Hampson in the fourth that left the Dodgers trailing 4-1. Kershaw allowed four runs and eight hits in six innings, struck out five and walked one.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t particularly sharp,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cOnce the postseason starts he\u2019s going to perform.\u201d\n\nKershaw gave up multiple first-inning homers for the second time in his career. He\u2019s also been dinged by single homers in the first this season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m guessing he would say that wasn\u2019t a very good night for him,\u201d Arenado said, \u201cbut he still went six innings, slider was still pretty nasty.\u201d\n\nRoberts got thrown out by plate umpire Greg Gibson for arguing balls and strikes in the bottom of the fourth. Roberts had been the only big league manager not tossed this season.\n\n\u201cI just thought there was a call that was a ball and he took offense to it,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cI thought it was a quick hook.\u201d\n\nIn the especially long inning, Colorado\u2019s three pitchers threw 61 pitches to 12 batters. The Dodgers tied a season high with seven runs, five hits, three walks and one batter hit by a pitch. The Rockies committed an error on a pickoff throw, too.\n\nCorey Seager got the comeback going with a solo shot off rookie Peter Lambert (3-7). Will Smith reached on an infield single that scored Chris Taylor, who was hit by a pitch.\n\nThe Dodgers scored the tying and go-ahead runs on back-to-back RBI singles by pinch-hitter Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez and Max Muncy that made it 5-4.\n\nPollock followed with his three-run shot to off Sam Howard that scored Hern\u00e1ndez and Muncy, extending the lead to 8-4.\n\nThe Dodgers tacked on four more runs in the seventh, when rookie Gavin Lux and Hern\u00e1ndez had RBI singles and Muncy added a two-run RBI double.\n\nSam Hilliard stroked Colorado\u2019s third homer of the game in the eighth with his first career pinch-hit homer.\n\nLambert gave up five runs and six hits in three-plus innings.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nRockies: LHP Kyle Freeland, out for a month with a left groin strain, could possibly work in relief Saturday. He would be on a 35-40 pitch limit if he does. He\u2019s struggled this season, with a 6.98 ERA in 20 starts for the team when he wasn\u2019t spending stretches at Triple-A Albuquerque.\n\nDodgers: Muncy experienced some tightness in his quad and it\u2019s not certain he\u2019ll play Saturday. \u2026 3B Justin Turner, out since Sept. 7 with a sprained left ankle, walked as a pinch hitter in the seventh and will start Saturday to get a few at-bats. \u2026 LHP Rich Hill (left knee strain) threw 17 pitches to hitters and had no pain while wearing a brace on his knee. He will start Tuesday at San Diego.\n\nIN THE SEATS\n\nThe Dodgers set a single-season attendance record with 3,875,656, surpassing their 2018 total of 3,857,500 in 83 games.\n\nON A LOSING NOTE\n\nThe Rockies haven\u2019t won at Dodger Stadium since June 30, 2018, and their 12-game skid is the longest in LA in franchise history. Only a 13-game losing streak in San Francisco (1999-2001) is longer for them in any road city.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRockies: RHP Chi Chi Gonz\u00e1lez (1-6, 6.23 ERA) has no decisions in two starts with a 4.35 ERA against the Dodgers this season.\n\nDodgers: RHP Walker Buehler (13-3, 3.15) flip-flops in the rotation with LHP Hyun-Jin Ryu and starts Saturday while Ryu goes Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "While the Dodgers were rallying during a fourth inning that took 41 minutes, Clayton Kershaw was inside tossing some pitches against the wall trying to stay loose.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Beth Harris"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/21/rockies_dodgers_baseball_56385_c0-158-3816-2382_s1770x1032.jpg?7f3c7c2e6e8dd80eb1b8e7fe14fb56f8ad01eaa3", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
