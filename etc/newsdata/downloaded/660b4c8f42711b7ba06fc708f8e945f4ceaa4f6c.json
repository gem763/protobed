What we are missing in the endless witchhunt news cycle is a fair and accurate accounting of what history will surely judge to be one of the greatest presidencies in modern times.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nHe echoed that sentiment talking with Smith: \"When I looked at the news cycle at night when I got home--crickets!\"\n\n\"When we have a president who, for three years during the Mueller-Russia witch hunt just did his job, put up great numbers on the economy, great numbers on trade...I mean, Sandra, this was like a beautiful thing for America,\" he said.\n\n\"And, all we got was a news cycle just overwhelmed by what is the second impeachment circus in three years. And, I'm looking at this thinking, 'This is simply a coup d'etat!\" Navarro said.", "description": "The media are ignoring the Trump administration's economic triumphs, White House Trade Advisor Peter Navarro said Tuesday.", "authors": ["Julia Musto", "Julia Musto Works With Fox News Channel'S", "America'S Newsroom."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/426de212-Dev_ENC1_132144181495380000.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
