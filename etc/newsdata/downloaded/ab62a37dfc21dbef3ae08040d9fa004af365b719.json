It just depends what the quo is.", "language": "en", "text": "It seems as though the fate of the Trump presidency hangs on those three Latin words. Find proof of a quid pro quo and Trump is a goner.\n\nBut that\u2019s not exactly true. The United States engages in quid pro quos all the time when it comes to foreign assistance. Our aid is not charity; Americans expect to get something in return for it. We have leveraged U.S. assistance in exchange for a host of objectives: economic reform, democratic reform, better pursuit of corruption, access to strategically important areas and so on.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn 1978, Jimmy Carter agreed to provide Egypt with billions of dollars in foreign aid in exchange for making peace with Israel, as part of the Camp David Accords. That was a quid pro quo. In 2004, George W. Bush created the Millennium Challenge Account, which required countries to meet a host of eligibility requirements \u2014 free speech, free assembly, rule of law, property rights, transparency \u2014 before they could receive a grant of aid. That program was one big quid pro quo.\n\nCongress imposes quid pro quos on U.S. foreign aid all the time, as well. Democrats howled when Trump cut aid to Central America earlier this year, but as Lester Munson, former staff director of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, points out, \u201cIf you look at the appropriations bill that actually provided the president with the money to give assistance to Central America, there are 15 different reasons you might suspend the aid there.\u201d\n\nEven former vice president Joe Biden has admitted to a quid pro quo with Ukraine. He held up $1 billion in loan guarantees (a quid) to get them to fire a prosecutor who was not investigating corruption (a quo). This was perfectly legitimate, he says, and he may well be right.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo, there is nothing intrinsically wrong with quid pro quos. It just depends what the quo is.\n\nIn his news conference, Mulvaney said \u201cthe money held up had absolutely nothing to do with Biden.\u201d Good, because holding up U.S. aid as a quid pro quo for investigating the president\u2019s political rival would be highly problematic. Rather, Mulvaney said, it was based on three issues: first, concerns about corruption in Ukraine; second, concerns about burden-sharing by our European allies in supporting Ukraine; and third, \u201cwhether they were cooperating in an ongoing investigation with our Department of Justice\u201d into the origins of the Mueller probe that is being led by U.S. Attorney John H. Durham, a career prosecutor. It was the third \u2014 conditioning aid on the Durham investigation \u2014 that prompted Democrats to say: Gotcha!\n\nMulvaney later said he misspoke, and that\u2019s probably true. As Kurt Volker, the former U.S. envoy to Ukraine, explained in his sworn deposition before the House Intelligence Committee, the Ukrainians did not know that the aid was being held up until more than up a month after Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (during which Trump never mentioned the aid was on hold). \u201cThey became aware later [that the aid was held up], but I don\u2019t believe they were aware at the time, so there was no leverage implied,\u201d Volker told the committee. If you are demanding a quid pro quo, you have to tell the country that you are holding up the quid until they deliver the quo. The Ukrainians didn\u2019t even know there was a quid.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut let\u2019s say Trump had in fact withheld U.S. aid to get Ukraine to cooperate with the Durham probe. There would be absolutely nothing wrong with that. The president, as the country\u2019s chief law enforcement officer, would be entirely within his rights to use aid as leverage to get Ukraine cooperate with an official Justice Department investigation. If it turns out that the quo was \u201cinvestigate my 2020 opponent,\u201d as acting ambassador William Taylor reportedly alleged during testimony on Capitol Hill Tuesday, then Trump is in big trouble; but if the quo is \u201ccooperate with the Justice Department,\u201d that\u2019s perfectly fine.\n\nSo, while Democrats may be insisting that Trump delenda est \u2014 \u201cTrump must be destroyed\u201d \u2014 they will need something more than this quid pro quo to do it.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The Ukrainians didn\u2019t even know there was a quid.", "authors": ["Marc A.
