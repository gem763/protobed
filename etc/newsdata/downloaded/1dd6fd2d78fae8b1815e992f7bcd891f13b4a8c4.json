We beat Germany and then we gave money.\u201d\n\nSo what does that have to do with the China trade war?\n\nTennenbaum explained that what Germany did was \u201crather clever.\u201d\n\nThey kept the currency low and exported a lot of items to the U.S. at a bargain, like German cars. The United States lost jobs due to currency depression, which in turn, had a ripple effect.\n\n\u201cJapan looked at that said, 'Hello! We hello we can do that,' \u201d he said. \u201cSo they kept the yen down \u2014 they wiped out our consumer electronics and other industries; exported a lot of good jobs out of the U.S.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut China \u201cdid it the best,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo we're running $360 billion trade deficit and the elites, you mention \u2014 a lot of economists \u2014 they say, 'Oh! This is OK.' That's nuts!\" Tennenbaum said. \"Every time we run a deficit that means that somebody made something in another country that we didn't make. So we had fewer \u2026 jobs.\n\nTennenbaum said if you add up all the future claims being made on the U.S. economy it\u2019s \u201ca little nerve-wracking.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat's happening now is that because all these jobs we've exported \u2014 we've had more social spending, we've had to borrow money, we've had to guarantee things to keep the old economy perking \u2014 and we bang our chests and say look how good we are,\u201d Tennenbaum said.\n\nHe believes that Trump\u2019s hard-line policy came way too late.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\u201cI just wish he had he or someone had done this years ago because it's hard to unwind and now you have all this uncertainty that's delaying capital spending and muting the economy which otherwise would be really strong,\u201d he explained.", "description": "Trump didn't start the trade war with China, said Michael Tennenbaum.", "authors": ["Julia Limitone"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Trumo-Xi-JinPing-iStock.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
