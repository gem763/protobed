But whatever policies are, ultimately they come back to either your revenues or your costs.\u201d\n\nThe former Exxon head, who served as US secretary of state in Donald Trump\u2019s government for just over a year before being fired in March 2018, added: \u201cIf you go back to the history of this, this was all fairly new.\u201d\n\nTillerson said he did not remember the climate costs being a determining factor in any decision made during his decade-long tenure at the helm of Exxon, which ended in 2016.\n\nJames\u2019s office has sought to cast Tillerson as a central figure in the securities fraud case, with Kevin Wallace, acting head of the attorney general\u2019s investor protection bureau, telling the court last week that the former chief executive was \u201cdeeply involved\u201d in working out the impact of climate science upon Exxon\u2019s business prospects.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Tillerson said several times that he did not recall email conversations with colleagues on the cost of carbon. During his time at Exxon, Tillerson used an email alias, calling himself \u201cWayne Tracker\u201d.\n\nTillerson did, however, say that he supports the Paris climate agreement, which Trump announced during Tillerson\u2019s tenure as secretary of state that the US planned to withdraw from, and that he favoured a price on carbon emissions.\n\nExxon has denied any wrongdoing over its pricing of carbon and accused the lawsuit of being politically motivated. The case is among the most high profile of around a dozen rather different lawsuits launched by jurisdictions across the US that are attempting to claim compensation from fossil fuel companies for the damage caused by rising sea levels, storms, heatwaves and other impacts stemming from the climate crisis.\n\n\u201cThe attention this case received certainly places a harsh light on Exxon which must make them uncomfortable,\u201d said Michael Gerrard, an expert in climate law at Columbia University. \u201cThey tried for years to stop this case from happening. This is all at least as much about reputation as it is about money.\u201d\n\nClimate activists staged protests at the start of the Exxon trial and have kept up their criticism of the company since then.\n\n\u201cRex Tillerson is a climate criminal,\u201d said Dominique Thomas, north-east regional organizer of climate group 350.org. \u201cYesterday was the seventh anniversary of Superstorm Sandy; a grave reminder that the lies of people like Rex Tillerson cause that kind of climate destruction.\u201d", "description": "Former chief of ExxonMobil and former secretary of state under Trump appeared in court after oil and gas giant was sued", "authors": ["Oliver Milman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8d074448fd29cc9724470fc29ba85083673b30c/0_160_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=284c9d9b7eadafa7deb69efbb809812d", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
