The latest effort, a rule that bars virtually all Central American migrants from seeking asylum in the U.S., was first made public on July 15. It requires anyone seeking asylum in the U.S. to first apply for (and be denied) asylum in another eligible country before being eligible in the U.S.\n\nImmigrant rights groups immediately sued, and the case wound its way through the courts. First, a federal district court granted a nationwide stay. This prevented the rule from taking effect until the court decided on the merits of the case. Later, a federal appeals court decided that the injunction should only hold circuit-wide. Then, Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco submitted an emergency application to the Supreme Court seeking a stay of the earlier temporary injunction.\n\nOn September 11, the Supreme Court granted Francisco\u2019s request, issuing a stay of the lower court\u2019s preliminary injunction. But to Justice Sonia Sotomayor, to even ask the Court to do this \u201cwas an extraordinary request,\u201d as she wrote in her dissent, in which only Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined. Sotomayor argued that the Trump administration did not meet the required burden of proof for the Supreme Court to justify weighing in.\n\nBut Sotomayor also took issue with a broader trend. The Trump administration has frequently sought to appeal directly to the highest court in the land\u2014and its five friendly faces\u2014rather than follow typical procedure through the various lower courts. The Supreme Court, Sotomayor argued, is setting a dangerous precedent by acquiescing to this request for a stay. Instead of heeding a lower court\u2019s unfavorable ruling, this administration heads to the Supreme Court with confidence.\n\nIn a forthcoming article for the Harvard Law Review, Stephen Vladeck calculated how much more frequently the Trump administration has gone to the Supreme Court than its predecessors. Vladeck documents that the administration has applied for \u201cat least 20 stays of lower-court rulings,\u201d filed \u201cnine petitions for writs of certiorari before judgment,\u201d and sought writs of mandamus against three different district judges in the first two and half years of his administration. In contrast, over the last 16 years, administrations have sought just \u201ceight stays from the Justices; four writs of certiorari before judgment; and zero writs of mandamus.\u201d In addition to asserting that the solicitor general\u2019s unique access to the Court makes his abuses more concerning, Vladek argues that the Justices themselves have largely become complicit.\n\n\u201cThe lower courts\u2019 decisions warrant respect,\u201d Sotomayor wrote in her dissent. Her colleagues\u2019 ruling was not just a decision affecting \u201csome of the most vulnerable people in the Western Hemisphere,\u201d she argued, but also enabled the administration \u201cto implement a rule that bypassed the ordinary rulemaking process.\u201d By permitting the virtual ban on asylum seekers to take effect, the Court also allowed the administration to overturn a \u201cforty-year-long status quo\u201d in asylum law and the protection this country has historically offered, as the ACLU argued in their response.\n\n\u201cI fear that the Court\u2019s precipitous action today risks undermining the inter-branch governmental processes that encourage deliberation, public participation, and transparency,\u201d Sotomayor wrote. Expressing regret that her colleagues did not see the import of their decision, she continued, \u201cNot long ago, the Court resisted the shortcut the [administration] now invites.\u201d\n\nThe district court granted the initial nationwide stay and gave three reasons for its decision, which Sotomayor explained in her dissent: The Trump administration\u2019s asylum rule was very likely \u201cinconsistent with the asylum statute\u201d; the administration had bypassed normal rulemaking procedures (as it has done with other unpopular immigration rules); and the administration\u2019s own argument for the rule was \u201cso poorly reasoned\u201d that it \u201cwas likely arbitrary and capricious.\u201d The Ninth Circuit appellate court denied the administration\u2019s request to fully reverse the district court\u2019s decision because it reasoned that the administration was unlikely to succeed on the merits of the issue. Then, on September 9, the district court reinstated its nationwide ban, overturning the Ninth Circuit\u2019s narrowed opinion based on new facts in the case.\n\nThe rule stems from an anti-immigrant policy that the Trump administration has been unable to put into play: Safe third country agreements. First proposed with Guatemala, then with Mexico, and more recently floated with Honduras, these bilateral agreements would in effect bar virtually all asylum seekers traveling from Central America and anyone else who follows a similar route from even reaching the U.S. The agreements work by requiring applications for asylum in the first \u201csafe\u201d country they reach. Because of the migration patterns in Central America, this would have the effect of forcing asylum seekers to file in Mexico or Guatemala before applying in the U.S. But by implementing its new rule instead, the Trump administration can bypass the need for bilateral agreements.\n\nMexico\u2019s asylum system is already overburdened, and Guatemala\u2019s asylum office has only seven staff members, hardly enough to process the many thousands making their way north, let alone provide the shelter and safety that migrants and asylum seekers need.\n\nThe July rule came after months of pressure on Guatemala, and to some extent Mexico, to sign safe third country agreements. In Guatemala, such a deal is deeply unpopular and the country\u2019s highest court ruled that an agreement needs approval from the president and the legislature. Mexico, for its part, has also continued to refuse such an agreement\n\nThe Trump administration has also implemented the Migrant Protection Protocols, informally known as the \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy, which is in effect despite a legal challenge that has yet to be formally heard. Under MPP, once an asylum seeker files in the U.S., they are arbitrarily sent to a U.S. detention center or back across the border to wait in Mexico for their hearing, sometimes for months. The \u201cmetering\u201d policy, which allows only a certain number of people to request asylum at a port of entry per day, has also delayed the asylum process. MPP has left migrants essentially homeless and unemployed in a kind of quasi-legal purgatory. It has also left Mexico struggling to provide resources and even shelter to the more than 40,000 people waiting. There\u2019s no system to track asylum seekers once they\u2019re in Mexico, and even fewer protections to keep people safe.\n\nThe effect of the Supreme Court\u2019s stay is to continue Trump\u2019s virtual ban on asylum seekers \u2014with all of the human misery it inflicts\u2014though the rule has yet to be tested on its merits.\n\nSotomayor, citing Vladek\u2019s law review article, wrote that the high court\u2019s granting a stay of the lower court\u2019s ruling should be an extraordinary act, but \u201cit appears the Government [administration] has treated this exceptional mechanism as a new normal. Historically, the Government has made this request rarely; now it does so reflexively.\u201d\n\nThe Court\u2019s decision to overturn the lower courts\u2019 stay has grave consequences both for asylum seekers and the judicial system. Because surely, this administration will turn again to its friends on the Supreme Court when it receives a ruling it dislikes.", "description": "President Trump and his Department of Justice have used \u201cevery tool in the toolbox\u201d\u2014to use immigration official Ken Cuccinelli\u2019s words\u2014to keep migrants and asylum seekers out of the United States.
