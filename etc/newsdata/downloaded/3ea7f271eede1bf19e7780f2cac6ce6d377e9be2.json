(Photo: Alex Brandon/AP) More\n\n\u2022 An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found 55 percent of Americans believe that Trump\u2019s actions \u201care a serious matter and merit an impeachment inquiry,\u201d compared with 39 percent who do not. (Six percent were not sure.) What\u2019s more, nearly a quarter of those polled (24 percent) say there is already enough evidence for Congress to impeach Trump and remove him from office.\n\n\u2022 A Quinnipiac poll found 53 percent of registered voters support the impeachment inquiry, compared with 43 percent who do not. (Four percent were undecided.) The same survey found voters virtually split on Trump\u2019s removal from office, with 45 percent saying he should be impeached and removed and 49 percent opposing the idea \u2014 a divide that falls within the poll\u2019s margin of error.\n\n\u2022 A Washington Post-Schar School poll found 58 percent of Americans endorse the decision by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to begin a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump, compared with 38 percent who do not. The same survey showed nearly half (49 percent) of the respondents believe the president should be removed from office, while 44 percent do not. The remaining 7 percent say they are undecided about his fate.\n\n\u2022 A Politico/Morning Consult poll found 50 percent of registered voters would support removing Trump from office, while 43 percent oppose the idea. Again, 7 percent of voters were undecided. Oddly, the survey found a higher percentage of respondents \u201cstrongly\u201d supporting Trump\u2019s removal (40 percent) than \u201cstrongly\u201d supporting the inquiry itself (38 percent).\n\nMore\n\nThe latest polls were conducted following a flurry of developments in the impeachment probe. Last week, it was reported that Trump also pressured Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison for information in an effort to discredit former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia probe. Then, while speaking to reporters on the White House lawn, Trump called on China to investigate the Bidens.\n\nThe new surveys come on the heels of a half-dozen others that not only showed growing support for the impeachment inquiry but also support for the president\u2019s removal from office.\n\nEarly Tuesday, the State Department blocked Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the European Union and a central player in the Ukraine controversy, from testifying before House committees probing impeachment. Defending the move on Twitter, Trump called the Democrat-led panels a \u201ctotally compromised kangaroo court.\u201d House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said he would consider it \u201cadditional strong evidence of obstruction.\u201d\n\nThe White House then sent an eight-page letter to Pelosi calling the impeachment inquiry unconstitutional, setting up a legal showdown between Trump and Congress.\n\nOn Twitter Wednesday, Trump responded to one impeachment data point.", "description": "The White House says the impeachment inquiry into President Trump is \u201cbaseless\u201d and \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d But four new national surveys find most Americans support the probe.", "authors": ["Dylan Stableford", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cJ0EM.fX6MyUzJlkyICgEw--~B/aD0yNzE3O3c9NDA3NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/0dee1470-eaa9-11e9-90d5-59a64ce940fa", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
