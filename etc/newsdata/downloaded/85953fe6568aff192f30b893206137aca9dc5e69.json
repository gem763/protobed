And with no help from a no-call this time.\n\nGoff passed for 283 yards and a touchdown and rushed for another score, and the Rams stopped New Orleans from scoring an offensive touchdown for the first time since 2016 during Los Angeles\u2019 27-9 victory Sunday.\n\nA strong performance by the Rams\u2019 defense, an impressive second half from Goff\u2019s offense, and another officiating decision that hurt the Saints were all overshadowed by Brees\u2019 departure late in the first quarter.\n\n\u201cI told him I\u2019m hoping for the best,\u201d Goff said of his postgame chat with Brees. \u201cHe\u2019s a great player for this league, a face of the league, and somebody we need in the league.\u201d\n\nBrees\u2019 throwing hand collided with Aaron Donald\u2019s outstretched hand while he threw an incompletion on the Saints\u2019 second drive, and the NFL\u2019s career leader in yards passing spent the afternoon on the Coliseum sideline with his thumb heavily wrapped. Brees will see a hand specialist Sunday night, he said.\n\n\u201cThere is only so much you can do here as far as a doctor seeing it on the sideline,\u201d Brees said. \u201cHoping it is not too significant.\u201d\n\nTeddy Bridgewater went 17 of 30 for 165 yards in solid relief, while Alvin Kamara rushed for just 45 yards for the Saints (1-1), who seemed understandably discombobulated without their longtime quarterback - although the Rams\u2019 defense deserves plenty of credit as well.\n\nBrees\u2019 absence \u201creally didn\u2019t change anything at all for us,\u201d Rams pass rusher Dante Fowler said. \u201cWe were doing a good job before he got hurt. Everybody was on top of their game.\u201d\n\nNew Orleans didn\u2019t score an offensive touchdown for only the fourth time in 13-plus seasons under coach Sean Payton, who got a lengthy contract extension before the game.\n\n\u201cIt is going to be a hard film to watch for guys,\u201d Payton said. \u201cWe got whipped up front.\u201d\n\nTodd Gurley rushed for 63 yards and scored his first touchdown of the season late in the third quarter of this rematch of the Rams\u2019 26-23 overtime win in New Orleans last January. That game turned on the infamous uncalled pass interference late in regulation by Rams cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman, who had six tackles in the rematch.\n\n\u201cEvery win is a big win, but today was a very important win,\u201d Robey-Coleman said. \u201cIt was a win that basically just closed all the chatter and the naysaying.\u201d\n\nThis one also contained early refereeing drama that left the Saints steamed: New Orleans\u2019 Cameron Jordan had a long fumble return for a touchdown wiped out in the second quarter. The play initially was ruled an incomplete pass before video review determined Goff had fumbled, but Jordan\u2019s long return didn\u2019t count because officials had blown the play dead.\n\nJordan was still furious after the game, even referring to the refs as \u201cthe Foot Locker\u201d and saying certain members of the officiating crew \u201cwere maybe in their prime a decade ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Drew is down, it\u2019s on the defense,\u201d Jordan added. \u201cI take it upon me. I don\u2019t know how many times we hit Jared Goff, but it wasn\u2019t enough. We\u2019ve got to create more turnovers.\u201d\n\nThe Saints were hampered by 11 penalties for 87 yards, while the Rams\u2019 offense recovered from a slow start to make three straight touchdown drives in the second half.\n\nBut this matchup between two of the most prolific offenses in NFL history was definitely not a fireworks show, between Brees\u2019 absence and the inconsistent performance of Los Angeles coach Sean McVay\u2019s offense. The Rams failed to score a touchdown in the first half for only the third time in McVay\u2019s tenure.\n\nKUPP RUNNETH OVER EVERYBODY\n\nShortly after Brandin Cooks caught a TD pass, Cooper Kupp made the play of the game with a spectacular 67-yard catch-and-run in the fourth quarter. Goff scored after Kupp was ruled down at the 1 by video review.\n\n\u201cIt was like something you only see in a football movie,\u201d Cooks said with a laugh.\n\nKupp finished with five catches for 120 yards, while Goff surpassed 10,000 career yards passing.\n\nINJURIES\n\nBoth teams had far too many. Along with Brees, the Saints lost left guard Andrus Peat to an ankle injury in the second half. Linebacker A.J. Klein also went to the locker room in the second half. Backup receiver Keith Kirkwood was ruled out with a hamstring injury in pregame warmups.\n\nThe Rams lost two offensive starters: right guard Austin Blythe injured his ankle in the first half, and tight end Tyler Higbee incurred a chest injury early in the second half.\n\nDonald missed part of the first half with a back injury, but the two-time Defensive Player of the Year returned.\n\nLAST SHOW\n\nThe game was the Rams\u2019 final home opener at the 96-year-old Coliseum: They\u2019ll move into SoFi Stadium in Inglewood next season. The Rams and Chargers unveiled the name of their multibillion-dollar complex before the game.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSaints: Staying on the West Coast this week to face the Seattle Seahawks next Sunday.\n\nRams: At the Cleveland Browns next Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "When Drew Brees went to the sideline holding his injured throwing hand, this NFC championship game rematch - and maybe this season's Super Bowl race - dramatically changed in an instant.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Greg Beacham"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/saints_rams_football_72277_c0-166-3971-2481_s1770x1032.jpg?2e02994b7bdbae11f8d9656dfdb062744ced539a", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
