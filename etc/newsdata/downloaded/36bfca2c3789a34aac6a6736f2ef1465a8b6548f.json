(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nJoshua A. Geltzer, formerly senior director for counterterrorism and deputy legal adviser at the National Security Council, is executive director and visiting professor of law at Georgetown\u2019s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection.\n\nPresident Trump has been fiercely criticized for requesting that Ukraine investigate his leading political rival, former vice president Joe Biden. But Trump doesn\u2019t just ask foreign leaders for domestic electoral assistance: He also gives it to them. Trump has now done just that for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, offering a foreign policy favor for domestic political benefit. Trump has, in effect, done for Erdogan exactly what he asked of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. And either seeking or providing such electoral interference is wildly inappropriate for a U.S. president.\n\nLike Trump, who is unpopular at home, Turkey\u2019s Erdogan has a problem \u2014 indeed, the same problem as Trump. His party lost big in local elections earlier this year, in part because he, like Trump, has been ineffective at governing and especially at managing Turkey\u2019s now-flailing economy. So Erdogan, too, needs to improve his domestic political standing; and like Trump, who looked to Ukraine for assistance, Erdogan sought help from another country.\n\nIn this case, that meant looking for a way to attack a familiar target for the Turkish government, the Kurds. Aggressive threats against the Kurds have become a staple for Turkish politicians, who decry the ethnic group as terrorists. More specifically, for Erdogan, attacking the Kurds right now means creating space in Syria to send back displaced Syrians who\u2019ve flooded into Turkey. Hence, the Wall Street Journal describes Erdogan as \u201cfacing growing discontent at home, including from his electoral base, with a majority of Turks calling for the government to send displaced Syrians back home.\u201d Erdogan then asked Trump for help: to get out of the way and give him the green light to attack the Kurds, thus making space in northern Syria to send back displaced Syrians.\n\n[The U.S. played down Turkey\u2019s concerns about Syrian Kurdish forces. That couldn\u2019t last.]\n\nBut where Trump didn\u2019t get what he asked Ukraine for, when Erdogan asked him for a similar favor, Trump said yes \u2014 virtually instantly, it appears, based on reports relying on a source serving on Trump\u2019s National Security Council. And Trump did so despite the astounding and obvious cost to U.S. security of abandoning the Syrian Kurds, America\u2019s most critical partners on the ground in Syria in preventing a resurgence of the terrorist threat posed by the Islamic State, including by continuing to hold thousands of Islamic State detainees.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, anyone in Trump\u2019s shoes would have known \u2014 or should have known \u2014 why Erdogan was asking for this favor. Erdogan\u2019s declining popularity has been widely reported. His party\u2019s recent losses and Turkey\u2019s spiraling economy have been major news. Erdogan has, as the New York Times put it, \u201cfor years made pronouncements of plans for a military intervention in the northern Syrian enclave.\u201d And Erdogan\u2019s desire to make good on those plans to create room to expel Syrians has been similarly widely known and unmistakable. All told, even Trump \u2014 now famous for paying at best sporadic attention to intelligence briefings \u2014 would have known, or at least should have known, that Erdogan was in domestic political trouble; that Erdogan saw ejecting displaced Syrians as a way to ease that trouble; and that Erdogan\u2019s plans for doing so required that the United States abandon the Kurdish partners who stood in Erdogan\u2019s way.\n\nWhether Trump was on the asking or receiving end of a request, this was the same basic play: an effort to boost domestic electoral standing not by delivering on actual domestic governance but by securing a \u201cfavor\u201d from a foreign leader. That\u2019s what Trump sought from Zelensky. And it\u2019s what Trump gave to Erdogan.\n\nTrump\u2019s request to Zelensky was a wildly inappropriate \u2014 indeed, unlawful \u2014 quid pro quo. But Trump\u2019s acquiescence to Erdogan was, in some ways, even more foolish: It was, so far as we can tell from the outside, a quid pro nothing. By all outward appearances, Trump\u2019s abandonment of the Syrian Kurds gave away the United States\u2019 key counterterrorism partner and unleashed a humanitarian atrocity for no identifiable U.S. benefit at all. It simply reflected Trump\u2019s consistent instinct to indulge authoritarian leaders at every turn.\n\n[All foreign policies look different in practice than in theory]\n\nThe moral and legal principles at stake here are clear: No American president should run the play that Trump tried out on Zelensky, and that Erdogan succeeded in with Trump. That is, no U.S. president should ask a foreign leader to intervene in America\u2019s own elections; and no U.S. president should indulge a foreign leader by sacrificing vital U.S. national interests for that foreign leader\u2019s personal political gain.\n\nBut Trump did both.\n\nUltimately, that reflects a profoundly mistaken view of what it means to hold public office. To do so entails serving personally the interests of the nation. The particulars of those interests can, of course, be the subject of fierce debate \u2014 this is the stuff of which normal political and policy disputes are made. But holding public office does not mean sacrificing the interests of the nation to serve oneself personally. That\u2019s what Trump did when he marshaled the force of U.S. diplomacy in an attempt to pressure Ukraine into boosting his electoral prospects. And it\u2019s what anyone in Trump\u2019s shoes would have understood Erdogan to be doing when he asked Trump to sell out the United States\u2019 own national security interests and commitments.\n\nThis is the foreign policy of those desperate to cling to power \u2014 not of those who genuinely seek to serve.", "description": "The assistance he offered to Erdogan is wildly inappropriate.", "authors": ["Joshua A.
