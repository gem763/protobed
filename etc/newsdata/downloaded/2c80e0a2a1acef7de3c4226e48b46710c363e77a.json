We want to screw over our minorities but also want to retain our image as tolerant and peaceful. This is not going to be possible unfortunately, given the transparency and viciousness with which we are going about our atrocities. With the entire Indian polity from government to judiciary playing along, it is only natural that the world will observe and object.\n\nIndia\u2019s response after the shellacking we received in the US Congress on the issues of Assam and Kashmir was predictably defensive and petty. In pushing back against the accusation that we were manhandling our own people, the foreign ministry moaned about cross border terrorism and whined about Pakistan not getting criticised sufficiently. And then we strut about the world pretending to be a great power.\n\nIt was excruciating to watch the studied clarity with which the American legislators arrived at an understanding of what India was doing to Muslims in Assam. The national register of citizens (NRC) was aimed at identifying who was not Indian? Correct. The absolute requirement was a full set of documents? Correct. The burden of proof for this was on the individual and not the state? Correct. Those who were suspected to be without them were locked up by India in concentration camps? Correct. There was a law that specifically excluded all but Muslims from these jails? Correct. Was it a \u201ccrackpot\u201d idea or a serious legislation? It was a serious legislation.\n\nEven the bureaucrats of the Trump administration, wheeled out to defend India against this reckless slander from the liberals, found it impossible to. This is how the Citizenship Amendment Bill \u2014 which excludes only South Asia\u2019s Muslims from getting Indian citizenship while offering it by default to Hindus, Sikhs and others \u2014 was discussed in a report. The co-chair of the India caucus (India\u2019s friend) Brad Sherman commented that \u201chuman rights abuse doesn\u2019t cease to be human rights abuse just because it is consistent with law\u201d.\n\nHe then sought a clarification whether there was a Bill in the Indian Parliament that seeks to discriminate against Muslims on the issue of citizenship.\n\nAssistant secretary Robert Destro acknowledged that the Bill gave a presumption of citizenship to all religious groups but leaves Muslims out. \u201cIs this a serious legislative proposal or just a crackpot idea going nowhere?\u201d an astonished Sherman asked. Destro said that it was indeed \u201ca serious legislative proposal\u201d, but \u201cthankfully, it is not going through the Upper House\u201d.\n\nSherman demanded to know whether the US had condemned the concept of defining someone\u2019s legal rights obligations based on their religion. To this Destro replied that \u201cwe are doing it right here. This is a good opportunity to do it.\u201d\n\nDestro commented that most religious groups are not discriminated against, but there was pressure to make special rules for Muslims for which US administration was \u201ccalling them out\u201d. \u201cIndia\u2019s Constitution provides for secularism and we want the same to continue,\u201d he added. And there were other equally damaging revelations about what we were doing to Kashmiris.\n\nOur response to this, to repeat, was to ask America why it wasn\u2019t saying bad things about Pakistan as well. To return to where we started, India has been seen in the modern age as a loveable and weird place, which means to do well but is not competent. I will illustrate this with a story from about 20 years ago when Shimon Peres was prime minister of Israel. Now Israel has the draft under which all citizens (except Muslims) are conscripted at the age of 18 and have to serve three years in the military. On coming out of conscription, about 85% of them come to India. Many of these young women and men become deeply familiar with our country, even more than some of us are. Anyway, I asked Peres why he thought they came here and not Europe or elsewhere. He thought about it and said: \u201cAfter three years of the most disciplined existence in the world\u2026\u201d he paused, \u201cthey seek a place with no discipline at all.\u201d We both laughed, because it is true.\n\nPeres was very warm to India, observing that our kindness showed in the way we were the only nation on earth to have stray canines in urban areas. We do not observe such things of course but to him this was high civilisation.\n\nThis image of an India that may not be efficient but means well is what we have endangered, though not fully ended, with our actions in Assam and Kashmir and elsewhere. It should be repeated here that Sherman and others on that panel were on the Indian caucus, meaning they are our friends. Even our friends stand astonished and disappointed by the cruelty with which we are building this new India. And all of us are complicit in allowing this to happen.", "description": "Happenings in America expose a fundamental hypocrisy about this new India of ours.
