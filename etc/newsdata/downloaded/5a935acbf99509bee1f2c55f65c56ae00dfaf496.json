(Photo: Ryan F. Mandelbaum)\n\nAn amateur astronomer may have detected an object from outside our solar system, according to an announcement from the Minor Planet Centre.\n\nAstronomers saw the first known interstellar object, called \u2018Oumuamua, in 2017. Its hyperbolic orbit indicated it had arrived from afar and wouldn\u2019t be coming back.\n\nTons of speculation followed as to what the object might be, speculation that of course included aliens. The newly spotted object would be the second such interstellar visitor \u2014 but there\u2019s a lot more observing yet to come.\n\nAn amateur astronomer named Gennady Borisov first spotted the object on August 31, using a telescope he built himself. Other observations (and hype) have followed.\n\nThursday, the Minor Planet Centre at the Centre for Astrophysics released an official circular on the object, now provisionally called C/2019 Q4 (Borisov). If scientists confirm its interstellar nature, it will receive a new name that begins with 2I, denoting it as the second interstellar object.\n\nWith more observations of the object, scientists have begun calculating the shape of its orbit. These calculations seem to reveal that the trajectory has a hyperbolic shape \u2014 rather than the elliptical shape that characterises the orbits of things circling the Sun. The trajectory suggests that the object will eventually exit the solar system, never to return.\n\nHere's a remarkable animation of #gb00234, which may be our second known interstellar visitor, taken by astronomer Gennady Borisov - who discovered the object. 2l/Borisov, perhaps?

The first interstellar visitor. \u2018Oumuamua. brought lots of excitement; to some, its strange, cigar-like shape seemed almost impossible.\n\nThis new object will certainly bring its own hype and speculation (and, surely, more talk of aliens). But it\u2019s especially exciting because astronomers will be able to make comparisons between it and \u2018Oumuamua. Initial observations already reveal that the object is an active comet with a big temporary atmosphere, or coma, Holman said.\n\n\u201cAbsent an unexpected fading or disintegration, this object should be observable for at least a year,\u201d according to the circular. We look forward to learning more about this potential visitor in the coming months.", "description": "An amateur astronomer may have detected an object from outside our solar system, according to an announcement from the Minor Planet Centre....", "authors": ["Sarah Basford", "Sam Rutherford"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/ppph5mb0zvhaauftd98v.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
