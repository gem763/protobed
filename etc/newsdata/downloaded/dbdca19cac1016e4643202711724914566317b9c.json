And he thinks he can oust Trump.\n\n\u201cFor Democrats that are out there, what I hear is a lot of anxiety about, hey, 'We need to beat Donald Trump,' and 'How are we going beat Donald Trump?'\u201d the former San Antonio mayor told NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d Sunday morning.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cWell, if you take a look at the modern era of presidential campaigns, when Democrats have won, it\u2019s because they\u2019ve taken a bit of a risk \u2014 whether it was Kennedy in 1960 or Carter in 1976 or Barack Obama in 2008. We need to get people off the sidelines in 2020.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, Castro argued that he could \u201creassemble the Obama coalition and then supercharge that\u201d to win Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania \u2014 and then snag Florida\u2019s 29 electoral votes, Arizona\u2019s 11 votes and perhaps even Texas\u2019 38 votes.\n\nCastro also commented on fellow presidential hopeful Joe Biden and what it would mean if the former vice president secured the party's nomination.\n\n\u201cWell, I think that Joe Biden would be a much better president, of course, than Donald Trump,\u201d Castro said. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t think that I would be a better president, I wouldn\u2019t be running this race. But I think that he would be a much better president than Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cI also believe that just on issues, Joe Biden and I have some disagreements,\u201d he added. \u201cWe talked about our disagreements on immigration on the stage at the last debate. I also believe that he hasn\u2019t gone far enough on health care. We need to base our health care off of the Medicare system and then allow for a private option. So we have real disagreements, but I won\u2019t argue with folks that say that any of the Democrats that are running or will be on the stage in Houston in a few days would be better than Donald Trump.\u201d", "description": "He also says any Democrat would be better than Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Aubree Eliza Weaver"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/04/3c/d0a7bc0942d094fe10c46cc4ef5d/20190829-julian-castro-forum-gty-773.jpg"}
