One of the primary motivations behind this decision\u2014if not the primary factor\u2014was the hope that expansion would save hospitals from certain demise. But after nearly six full years of expansion and hundreds of thousands of able-bodied adults added to welfare, Arkansas\u2019 hospitals are still struggling\u2014and many of them have closed.\n\nThis comes as no surprise to those of us who can plainly see that expanding welfare doesn\u2019t create jobs or bolster economic activity. (Indeed, it does quite the opposite.) But still, these hospital closures simply cannot be overlooked, especially as more states consider whether or not to bring this same nightmare home.\n\nJust this week, news reports out of Arkansas classified the health of the state\u2019s hospitals as \u201ccondition critical.\u201d\n\nLast week, one of the largest hospitals in the state announced layoffs.\n\nIn September, the CEO of the Arkansas Hospital Association said 2018 has been \u201ca tough year\u201d for smaller hospitals financially and expressed concern that some rural hospitals in the state may be approaching closure.\n\nIn August, a large hospital in central Arkansas\u2014the only hospital in the Little Rock suburb of Jacksonville\u2014shuttered its doors, resulting in layoffs and leaving local residents without quick access to an emergency room.\n\nThen the largest hospital in the state, Baptist Health, reported a $21 million operating loss, after posting a net loss of $30 million the year before.\n\nIn January, reports emerged that DeQueen Medical Center in rural Arkansas was on the verge of shuttering as well, as payroll checks arrived late, practitioners began leaving, and some services were discontinued. It closed in February and now local residents are being forced to fork over more tax dollars to pay for a new facility\u2014on top of the billions taxpayers are already paying for expansion, which was supposed to save hospitals on its own.\n\nIn June of last year, another hospital in rural Arkansas reported a $2 million loss, and UAMS, the largest state-run hospital in Arkansas, laid off 600 positions.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: this was never supposed to happen. Arkansas, my home state, was supposed to thrive after Medicaid expansion. We were promised a thousand new hospital jobs, higher tax revenues, and a chicken in every pot. Instead, here we are\u2014layoffs, closures, and a massive new welfare program that we are paying to prop up.\n\nAnd as I\u2019ve traveled the country and worked on the issue of Medicaid expansion in other states, I\u2019ve seen that other states are being pitched the same bill of goods that we bought.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a story that the media establishment is interested in telling. They\u2019ve never met a welfare expansion they didn\u2019t like and the real story about what\u2019s happening in Arkansas undercuts their narrative. But this is a story that needs to be told.\n\nLocal hospitals are critical to our communities and the health of our neighbors. But it\u2019s a fool\u2019s errand to think that ObamaCare expansion is the cure for what ails them.\n\nAt a recent hearing on Medicaid expansion in Missouri, a representative of the local hospital association testified that expansion would be \u201cbetter than nothing\u201d for hospitals. After spending billions on Medicaid expansion over the last several years in Arkansas and seeing these results, I\u2019m confident he\u2019s wrong.\n\nNic Horton is the research director for the Foundation for Government Accountability", "description": "Another broken ObamaCare promise: Medicaid expansion is (still) not saving .10/25/2019 17:58:51PM EST.", "authors": ["Nicholas", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/297/812dfc3b-87fc-4fed-b777-687c77f7439c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
