With three tier one nations also in the group, along with a more-than-handy USA team, Toutai Kefu\u2019s side are not sure to even match their one win from four years ago, though Kefu has spoken of his intent to make the quarter-finals.\n\nIn what was their finest World Cup hour, Tonga beat France at the 2011 edition \u2013 and with the French far from a defined entity and spotty in terms of performances, their meeting on 6 October may represent Tonga\u2019s best chance of securing two wins.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Sixty times an Australian international, Kefu won the World Cup with the Wallabies in 1999. He has been head coach of his native Tonga since 2016 and done well to manage a squad that has been plagued by unavailability and inconsistency. He secured Tonga\u2019s first win against Fiji since 2011 last year. \u201cWe\u2019re in a tough pool, there\u2019s no doubt about it,\u201d Kefu has said ahead of the tournament. \u201cWe just need to get together and believe in what we\u2019re doing and believe that we can make it. And I certainly think we can.\u201d\n\nKey Player\n\nSonatane Takulua. The Newcastle Falcons scrum-half has dual importance to this Tongan side. With a fair amount of uncertainty at fly-half, Takulua may have chief playmaking duties, bringing Tonga\u2019s beefy band of big ball-carriers into the game around the fringes and picking and choosing his moments to spin the ball wider to Telusa Veainu and co.\n\nHe will also handle tee-related affairs \u2013 he\u2019s a fine kicker and if Tonga can keep themselves close then Takulua has the temperament and quality to knock over the points required to take advantage.\n\nPast Record\n\nAustralia/New Zealand 1987 \u2013 eliminated in the pool stages (zero wins)\n\nSouth Africa 1995 \u2013 eliminated in the pool stages (one win)\n\nWales 1999 \u2013 eliminated in the pool stages (one win)\n\nAustralia 2003 \u2013 eliminated in the pool stages (zero wins)\n\nFrance 2007 \u2013 eliminated in the pool stages (two wins)\n\nNew Zealand 2011 \u2013 eliminated in the pool stages (two wins)\n\nEngland 2015 \u2013 eliminated in the pool stages (one win)\n\nPrediction\n\nTonga will beat the United States, and come very close to beating one of Argentina and France, but will ultimately come away from the World Cup with just one win.\n\nFixtures\n\nSunday 22 September \u2013 England vs Tonga (11.15am), Sapporo\n\nSaturday 28 September \u2013 Argentina vs Tonga (5.45am), Higashiosaka\n\nSunday 6 October \u2013 France vs Tonga (8.45am), Kumamoto\n\nSunday 13 October \u2013 USA vs Tonga (6.45am), Higashiosaka\n\nOdds\n\nTonga to win the World Cup: 1000/1", "description": "Tonga\u00a0are looking to rebound from a disappointing 2015 Rugby World Cup with a better tournament in Japan.
