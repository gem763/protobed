Fuck me, that\u2019s a lot.\n\nSure, you can \u201cdrink wine\u201d en mass and \u201ctake home an insane amount of cheese\u201d. Whenever I do that I\u2019m told I\u2019m being a \u201cpublic nuisance\u201d and that I need to \u201cleave Harris Farm immediately.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE 13 Of The Best Aussie Cheese Shops That'll Have You Reaching For The Fancy Jatz\n\nA spot at the table with an apron and access to both the wine and the cheese (imperative) will set you back a very tidy $85 for the shorter, burrata-making class, and $120 for the longer, more intensive halloumi-making class \u2013 I can assure you that a public intoxication and cheese theft fine will be much more expensive.\n\nLock in a spot over on the Omnom Cheese-Making website, and wrangle your cheese-loving group chat quickly because the workshops are selling out like hotcakes.
