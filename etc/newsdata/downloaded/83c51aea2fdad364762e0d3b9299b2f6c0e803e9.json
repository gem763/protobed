Meanwhile, FedEx reiterated its forecast for 2020 capital expenditures of $5.9 billion.\n\n\u201cFedEx is implementing additional cost-reduction initiatives to mitigate the effects of macroeconomic uncertainty, including post-peak reductions to the global FedEx Express air network to better match capacity with demand,\u201d CFO Alan B. Graf, Jr., said in a statement. \u201cHowever, we are continuing to make strategic investments to improve our capabilities and efficiency, which we expect will drive long-term increases in earnings, margins, cash flows and returns.\u201d\n\nThe disappointing results come during an already trying time for FedEx, which in recent quarters has continually pointed to unresolved trade tensions and a weak global growth outlook as sources of uncertainty for the company heading into 2020.\n\nOther concerns about FedEx\u2019s core shipping business have put investors on edge over the future prospects of the company, especially as competition in the delivery space continues to ramp.\n\nFedEx in August severed ties with Amazon by announcing it would be ending its ground shipping contract with the e-commerce giant, after earlier in June saying it would allow its FedEx Express agreement with Amazon to expire without renewal as well. In building out its own delivery services as of late, Amazon has increasingly become a competitor to FedEx, which asserted that the tech behemoth comprised just 1.3% of its overall annual revenue. Peer delivery service UPS (UPS), however, has maintained its relationship with Amazon.\n\nDuring an earnings call Tuesday, FedEx\u2019s Graf said that \u201cthe loss of volume from Amazon had a negative impact to the quarter.\u201d\n\nFedEx reported results for 1Q 2020 after market close Tuesday.

The company also said that this year\u2019s consolidated results were adjusted for TNT Express integration expenses of $71 million, or 21 cents per diluted share.\n\nDuring the call with analysts Tuesday, Graf acknowledged the company was \u201clate and over budget\u201d on the TNT integration. Smith provided an updated timeline for integration of TNT, saying that FedEx was \u201cwell on [its] way to achieving full ground interoperability\u201d in its European pickup and delivery networks in Europe by the end of May 2020.", "description": "FedEx (FDX) reported first-quarter results that missed consensus expectations and lowered guidance for the fiscal 2020 year.", "authors": ["Emily Mccormick"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/P2RlWVxqIzPrZaP8rmzAQw--~B/aD0xNjA4O3c9MjQzNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-06/63f7d920-984a-11e9-bfbb-03af70f03375", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
