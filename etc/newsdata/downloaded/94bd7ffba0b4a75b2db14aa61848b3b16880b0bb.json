As I mentioned in that piece, the rest of the 2020 field of candidates should probably be criticizing Castro, and they likely would be if he was any threat to anyone\u2019s electoral chances but his own. Well, we can scratch that theory for the moment. Bernie Sanders has ridden to the rescue and decided to adopt at least one of Castro\u2019s policies for his own platform.\n\nThis had to do with the deportation of illegal immigrants caught inside the borders of the United States. You might guess that Bernie is looking for less people \u201cliving in cages\u201d or perhaps better legal representation. But you\u2019d be wrong. Now Bernie wants to end all deportations. Period. Full stop. (Daily Caller)\n\nWhile speaking before a left-wing Latino audience, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders pledged to end immigration raids and impose a \u201cmoratorium\u201d on all deportations. \u201cWe are going to end the ICE raids that are terrorizing communities all across this country,\u201d Sanders said Saturday in Las Vegas, according to footage flagged by the Republican National Committee. \u201cWe are going to impose a moratorium on deportations. And we are going to, as I mentioned \u2014 and there are some things that a president can do with executive orders and some things you can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re to be forgiven if you think this is too crazy of an idea, even for Sanders, and are demanding some proof. Well, let\u2019s go to the video.\n\nAt first glance, this looks like a desperation move by Sanders. He\u2019s been essentially running the same playbook this year that he used when he came close to beating Hillary Clinton in the 2016 primary. But back then he was really the only viable, hard-left option on the table for voters. Now the field is littered with socialists proposing even crazier plans than his. Sanders sees his position as the only alternative to Biden slipping away to Elizabeth Warren and he needs to get his mojo back. I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s where this scheme came from.\n\nIf we stop and think about it, however, this \u201cpolicy\u201d is somewhat in line with most of the rest of Bernie\u2019s grandiose plans. For example, when it comes to Medicare for All, Bernie tosses out the grenade and offer no sane explanation as to how he would pay for it all. Now, on the immigration control front, he declares that we\u2019ll simply stop deporting people. But he offers not the slightest clue as to what we\u2019ll do with all of them.\n\nWe already have a massive backlog in our immigration courts. The holding facilities for illegal aliens are mostly full to the brim, a fact that Sanders has fundraised off of and complained about loudly. So what does Sanders propose that we do with them all? He won\u2019t come out and say the words, but there\u2019s only one other option. Release them all. This would effectively work out to be the same as Castro\u2019s proposal to decriminalize illegal border crossings and let people simply come and go as they please.\n\nThere\u2019s another popular phrase to describe plans such as this. Open borders. That\u2019s where Sanders has landed on immigration. He\u2019s literally proposing an open borders policy. So please do us all a favor and stop claiming that \u201cnone of the Democrats support open borders.\u201d One of your top tier candidates is doing just that.", "description": "Is he trying to one-up Castro?", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Bernie-Sanders-3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
