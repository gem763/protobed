Kamala Harris claimed during a climate change town hall Wednesday that she once sued Exxon Mobil for allegedly misleading shareholders and the public about the threats of climate change. But according to several reports, that's not true.\n\nHarris made the assertion when CNN moderator Erin Burnett asked if Harris would sue the fossil fuel company if elected president.\n\n\u201cI have sued Exxon Mobil,\u201d she said, drawing applause from the audience.\n\nKAMALA HARRIS THREATENS TO END FILIBUSTER TO PASS GREEN NEW DEAL\n\nBut InsideClimate News reported last week that although Harris vowed to take on Exxon while she was California\u2019s attorney general in 2016, New York\u2019s Attorney General Barbara Underwood was the only one to actually sue the oil giant.\n\nThe California Office of the Attorney General confirmed to the publication that no lawsuit was filed against Exxon from 2011 to 2017, when Harris was the state's attorney general, or between 2004 and 2011 when she was San Francisco\u2019s district attorney.\n\nThree other sources also claim no Harris lawsuit against Exxon exists: a San Francisco-based law firm filing a civil suit against Exxon over climate change, Columbia University's database of climate change litigation and Energy in Depth, a pro-oil advocacy organization.\n\nKAMALA HARRIS SLAMMED FOR 'POLITICIZING' PHILADELPHIA STANDOFF\n\nIn addition, Politifact also rated her claim is false.\n\n\"The facts are Harris opened an investigation against Exxon for lying about climate change.
