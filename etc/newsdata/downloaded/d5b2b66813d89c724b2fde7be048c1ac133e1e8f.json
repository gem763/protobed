Rafael Reif said in a statement Thursday afternoon.\n\n\u201cBecause the members of my team involved believed it was important that Epstein not use gifts to MIT for publicity or to enhance his own reputation, they asked [MIT Media Lab Director Joi Ito] to agree to make clear to Epstein that he could not put his name on them publicly.\u201d\n\nReif said he also was present at a meeting of his senior team where attendees discussed Epstein\u2019s crimes and donations.\n\nThe disclosure is the latest to rock the elite research institution, which has been roiled by a slow drip of revelations about close ties between the MIT Media Lab and Epstein, a registered sex-offender.\n\nReif\u2019s Thursday statement summarized the preliminary findings of an investigation by outside law firm Goodwin Procter into Epstein\u2019s connections to the Media Lab\u2014an institute that exercised broad influence over the technology industry\u2014and to Ito and the university writ large.\n\nReif noted that the law firm\u2019s probe revealed that he had signed an acknowledgment letter thanking Epstein\u2014listed as a \u201cdisqualified donor\u201d in MIT\u2019s own records\u2014for a donation after he had pleaded guilty to a prostitution charge stemming from a sex-trafficking investigation.\n\n\u201c I apparently signed this letter on August 16, 2012, about six weeks into my presidency,\u201d Reif wrote. \u201cAlthough I do not recall it, it does bear my signature.\u201d\n\nReif wrote that Ito asked members of MIT\u2019s senior team for permission to keep an Epstein donation in 2013, and they allowed it.\n\n\u201cThey knew in general terms about Epstein\u2019s history\u2013that he had been convicted and had served a sentence and that Joi believed that he had stopped his criminal behavior. They accepted Joi\u2019s assessment of the situation. Of course they did not know what we all know about Epstein now,\u201d Reif said.\n\nIn July, federal prosecutors in New York charged Epstein with sex trafficking and accused him of paying dozens, if not hundreds, of underage girls for sexual acts. A money manager with a deep Rolodex of famous people, Epstein killed himself in jail while awaiting trial.\n\nIto resigned as head of the Media Lab after the New Yorker reported he had hidden the extent of Epstein\u2019s involvement with the institute. Ito had also taken Epstein\u2019s money for his own personal investments.\n\nReif concluded the letter by saying that \u201cflaws in our processes\u201d needed to be addressed. Goodwin Procter\u2019s investigation is ongoing.\n\nEpstein served as a liaison for the lab, courting prominent donors like Bill Gates, who gave $2 million to the lab after Epstein made overtures to him, according to emails published by the New Yorker. A spokesperson for Gates denied that Epstein ever directed Gates\u2019 giving, and Ito hid Epstein\u2019s involvement as an ambassador from his MIT superiors.\n\nMIT did not immediately respond to request for comment, nor did Goodwin Procter.", "description": "In fact, he wrote Epstein a thank-you note for one gift.
