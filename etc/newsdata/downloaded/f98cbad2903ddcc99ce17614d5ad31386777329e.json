But experts who study tobacco policy fear the scattershot approach of the clampdown could have damaging, unintended consequences, including driving adults who vape back to cigarette smoking, which remains the nation\u2019s leading preventable cause of death.\n\n\u201cThis could take us from potentially the single biggest improvement in public health in the United States toward a public health disaster in which cigarettes continue to be the dominant nicotine product,\u201d said Jonathan Foulds, an addiction researcher and tobacco specialist at Penn State University.\n\nFoulds and many other experts continue to view e-cigarettes as a potential \u201coff-ramp\u201d for smokers, allowing them to continue using nicotine \u2014 the addictive chemical in cigarettes \u2014 without inhaling all the toxic byproducts of burning tobacco.\n\nBut they warn the vaping backlash could do irreparable harm to the public perception of e-cigarettes, while ignoring the riskiest products that are most likely to blame for the recent outbreak.\n\nFederal investigators say that nearly 80 percent of people who have come down with the vaping illness reported using products containing THC, the high-inducing chemical found in marijuana. They have not traced the problem to any single product or ingredient. But investigators are increasingly focused on thickeners and additives found in illegal THC cartridges sold on the black market.\n\nOn Friday, the Food and Drug Administration specifically warned the public not to vape THC or purchase any vaping products off the street.\n\nTHC vapes are separate from the legal, nicotine-filled e-cigarettes being targeted by President Donald Trump and politicians across the country.\n\nDemocratic governors in New York, Michigan, Washington, Rhode Island and Oregon have followed the president\u2019s plan to ban flavored e-cigarettes nationally with their own state-level flavor restrictions. Massachusetts\u2019 Republican governor has gone even further, placing a four-month moratorium on sales of vaping products of any kind.\n\n\u201cThe problem here is we have convinced adult America that vaping is as dangerous as smoking \u2014 and nothing could be further from the truth,\u201d said Kenneth Warner, professor emeritus at the University of Michigan\u2019s school of public health.\n\nE-cigarettes generally heat a flavored nicotine solution into an inhalable aerosol. There is little research on the long-term effects of inhaling the chemicals in vaping, such as vegetable glycerin. Despite those unknowns, most experts agree e-cigarettes pose a much smaller risk than cigarettes, which cause cancer, lung disease and stroke and account for some 480,000 U.S. deaths each year.\n\nEven before the current uproar over vaping, most adults considered e-cigarettes dangerous. A 2017 government survey found 55 percent of Americans considered e-cigarettes as harmful as regular cigarettes.\n\nAnd while the flavor bans are likely to curb teen vaping, Warner and others point out that those policies won\u2019t prohibit flavors in traditional tobacco products. That means both teens and adults could wind up switching to deadlier menthol cigarettes or flavored cigars, which come in coffee, raspberry, chocolate and hundreds of other varieties.\n\nWALKING A POLICY TIGHTROPE\n\nThe policy debate underscores the challenge of finding the right regulatory scheme for e-cigarettes, products for which there is little high-quality research.\n\nMore than 30 countries prohibit vaping products. In contrast, the United Kingdom has fully embraced them as a public health tool, urging doctors to promote them to help smokers quit.\n\nThe U.S. FDA has been struggling to find the right approach since it gained authority over e-cigarettes in 2016.\n\nThe agency repeatedly delayed its deadline to begin reviewing e-cigarettes, a step that critics say allowed products like Juul to catch on with teenagers. At the same time, e-cigarette companies and proponents say the agency\u2019s new review deadline of next May is too aggressive and will force most companies out of business.\n\nNow the agency is trying to walk a tightrope between keeping e-cigarettes away from teens but preserving them for an estimated 10 million adults who use them, most of whom also smoke.\n\nFurther complicating the picture is the fact that no e-cigarette brand has yet been shown to help smokers quit in rigorous studies. But large-scale surveys suggest smokers who use e-cigarettes daily are up to six times more likely to quit than those who don\u2019t use them.\n\nRISK OF SMOKING RELAPSE\n\nThe statistics favoring e-cigarettes are bolstered by the experiences of people like Laura Adams, 52, of Battle Creek, Michigan.\n\nA smoker since age 16, Adams was rushed to the hospital in April when a coughing fit left her struggling to breathe. Doctors diagnosed her with chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, or COPD, and told her she needed to quit cigarettes.\n\nFor more than 25 years previously, Adams had smoked clove-flavored cigarettes. When the government banned those in 2009, she switched to flavored cigars.\n\n\u201cI always liked the flavors better than regular tobacco,\u201d Adams said.\n\nAfter her medical emergency, Adams tried a series of e-cigarettes at a local vape shop before settling on a large, refillable device that allowed her to switch between flavors like blueberry, watermelon and peach.\n\n\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, flavored vaping juice saved my life,\u201d Adams said. \u201cIt gave me the option of continuing with my nicotine but without destroying my lungs.\u201d\n\nAs Michigan stores pull their flavored products to comply with the state ban, Adams has been researching out-of-state suppliers and even do-it-yourself kits for mixing flavors.\n\nBut some public health advocates fear less motivated ex-smokers will simply return to cigarettes. Even with the success of Juul, e-cigarettes remain a tiny slice of the U.S. tobacco market, accounting for $8.6 billion in sales compared to $95 billion for cigarettes, according to Euromonitor.\n\nIndustry analysts point to early indicators that e-cigarette sales are beginning to flag amid the bans and negative headlines. E-cigarette sales slowed by 11 percent over the four weeks ended Sept. 22, according to retail data tracked by Nielsen.\n\nThe trend \u201ccould result in improved combustible cigarette\u201d sales \u201cas vapers potentially return\u201d to smoking, Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog told investors in a recent note.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly the opposite of what public health officials have been trying to achieve, noted former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, who stepped down in April.\n\nAs FDA chief, Gottlieb outlined an ambitious anti-smoking plan intended to shift most of the nation\u2019s 34 million smokers away from cigarettes and toward less risky products. The unprecedented plan involved a two-step process: cutting nicotine in traditional cigarettes to make them virtually nonaddictive and then promoting FDA-sanctioned, lower-risk alternatives, such as e-cigarettes.\n\nBut the agency has yet to unveil its proposal for cutting nicotine. And a separate proposal to ban menthol cigarettes is still in regulatory limbo.\n\nSo as the agency begins sweeping flavored e-cigarettes off the market in coming months, Gottlieb fears smokers may revert to regular cigarettes and cigars, which will still have nicotine levels and flavors designed to addict users.\n\n\u201cThis was always a package deal, and it\u2019s become even more critical than ever to advance that entire policy agenda,\u201d he said.\n\nThe FDA says it remains committed to Gottlieb\u2019s vision of lower-nicotine cigarettes and less-harmful alternative products. The agency\u2019s regulatory calendar lists this month as the target date to release its proposal for regulating nicotine. But that effort will take years to implement and will almost certainly face lawsuits from tobacco companies.\n\nMeanwhile, it remains unclear which e-cigarettes \u2014 if any \u2014 will survive the FDA review process set to begin in May.\n\nUnder agency standards, only vaping products that represent a net benefit to the nation\u2019s public health are supposed to be permitted. Proving that standard will require companies to submit detailed analysis of their ingredients and population-level estimates of how their products will impact both adult and underage users.\n\nIndustry observers say few, if any, of the thousands of vape shops that mix their own custom flavors and solutions will be able to meet the threshold.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ironic that the vape shops, who really championed e-cigarettes for smoking cessation, are going to be out of business,\u201d said Dr. Neal Benowitz, a nicotine and tobacco researcher at the University of California San Francisco.\n\nThat leaves a handful of industry heavyweights such as Juul, which could benefit from billions in research funding from Marlboro-maker Altria, the tobacco company that owns a 35 percent stake in the vaping firm.\n\nBut Juul has been besieged by lawsuits and investigations into its alleged role in triggering the explosion of teen vaping. That history could block the company from ever winning FDA approval for its current device, according to former FDA officials.\n\nA THIRD WAY\n\nThe uncertainty swirling around vaping could clear the path for another product that is neither a traditional cigarette nor an e-cigarette.\n\nEarlier this year, the FDA authorized the sale of a first-of-a-kind device, IQOS, that heats tobacco without burning it. The approach is designed to mimic the experience of smoking while producing fewer toxic chemicals than paper-and-tobacco cigarettes.\n\nThe battery-powered device is getting a preliminary launch this month in Atlanta ahead of a wider rollout. But IQOS\u2019s pedigree underscores the persistence of Big Tobacco companies, even in a world increasingly focused on vaping and other alternative products.\n\nIQOS was developed by Philip Morris International, the global tobacco giant that sells Marlboro cigarettes overseas. It will be sold in the U.S. by the biggest American cigarette maker, Altria, which is also Juul\u2019s biggest investor.\n\n___\n\nFollow Matthew Perrone on Twitter: @AP_FDAwriter\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.
