In my view, this review is absolutely the best way of doing that,\" he said.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Jeremy Corbyn fields reporters' questions as he arrives at the Labour party conference\n\nAnalysis: Labour message 'damaged'\n\nBy BBC political correspondent Susana Mendonca\n\nLet's face it - no-one likes finding out by text that they're getting ditched.\n\nBut this wasn't the morning after a bad date, this was the morning after the latest instalment in the saga that is Labour's fractious relationship with itself.\n\nAnd the deputy leader wasn't happy at being told by text last night that a plot was afoot to ditch him by abolishing his post.\n\nA \"sectarian attack\", \"pluralism not tolerated\", a \"drive-by shooting\" even, Tom Watson told the Today programme.\n\nIf this conference was supposed to be a moment for Labour to come together, place the focus on its policies and show the country it's a unified force ready to lead after a general election, well, it didn't start well.\n\nThe Parliamentary Labour Party's letter to its governing body described the move as a \"gross act of suppressing dissent\".\n\n\"These kinds of things happen in Venezuela,\" said Mr Watson. Music to the ears no doubt of the Conservatives who've long been making those comparisons in relation to Labour's leadership.\n\nJeremy Corbyn appears to be trying out a bit of damage limitation with talk now of a \"review\" of the role rather than immediate abolition.\n\nBut the damage to Labour's message ahead of its conference appears to have been done.\n\nThe row over Mr Watson's position threatened to overshadow Labour's party conference.\n\nOn Saturday morning, in an interview on BBC's Today programme, Mr Watson said the move by Momentum was \"moving us into a different kind of institution where pluralism isn't tolerated\".\n\nHe went on to appeal to Momentum activists to focus on showing people they were serious about changing the political economy of Britain rather than having \"a sort of sleight-of-hand constitutional change to do a drive-by shooting of someone you disagree with\".\n\nShortly after, the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP), which represents Labour backbenchers, wrote a letter to members of the National Executive Committee - including Mr Corbyn - saying the move was counterproductive and sent the country a message \"we are more interested in internal battles\" than constituents' lives.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Tony Blair, who led Labour from 1994 to 2007, said abolishing the deputy leader post would be \"undemocratic and politically dangerous\".\n\nDawn Butler, shadow women and equalities secretary, said Momentum's move had \"come out of the blue\" but she could understand the frustration with the deputy leader who had not been seen at shadow cabinet meetings \"for a while\".", "description": "Jeremy Corbyn quashes a conference motion to oust Tom Watson as MPs warn against a \"civil war\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07nzcfq.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
