Ankara says it is targeting Kurdish forces linked to an insurgency at home.\n\nThe Turkish attack began after U.S. forces that have backed the SDF withdrew from part of the Syrian-Turkish border. The SDF, a major ally of the United States against Islamic State, called it a stab in the back.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said the United States was poised to evacuate about 1,000 U.S. troops from northern Syria after learning that Turkey planned to extend its incursion further south and west than originally planned.\n\nAnother consideration in the decision, U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper indicated, was that Washington\u2019s Kurdish-led ally, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), were looking to make a deal with Russia to counter the Turkish offensive.", "description": "The Syrian government and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces have been holding negotiations at a Russian airbase in Syria, a Syrian Kurdish politician told Reuters on Sunday, expressing hope for a deal that would halt a Turkish attack.", "authors": ["Tom Perry", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191013&t=2&i=1440442600&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9C0KP", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
