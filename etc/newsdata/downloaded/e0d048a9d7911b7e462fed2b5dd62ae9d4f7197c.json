Owen Burke/Business Insider\n\nI'm the kind of person who constantly finds themselves saying something along the lines of the common refrain '...and this is why I can't have nice things.' But guess again, old adage, guess again. Stuart & Lau's Cary briefcase hath, once and for all, proven thee wrong.\n\nI've tried countless briefcases and messenger bags over the years, and none of them have survived me for much longer than a year. I always manage to find the weakest seam, generate the most horrific stains, and break what seemed to be the sturdiest straps.\n\nFrom the subway to the airport to the weekend trips and even out on the sea, Stuart & Lau's Cary briefcase just won't give up the ghost. Through it all, this bag has, dare I say, provided me with an almost incomprehensible air of polishedness I don't think I've ever achieved before.\n\nOn specs, features, and design\n\nIt's pretty slimline, too, if you allow it to be (by not overstuffing it). Owen Burke/Business Insider\n\nWaterproof nylon (Stuart & Lau's proprietary DuraLite, to be specific), YKK Excella zippers (which are a good step above YKK's regular quality zippers), full-grain leather straps and handles, an umbrella holder, and a luggage sleeve make this the ultimate all-weather, all-season briefcase in my book, unless you're plying the tundra or really out in the elements (then I recommend checking out Thule's Gauntlet).\n\nThe Cary comes in three sizes: the Slim ($295), the Single ($325), and the Double ($350). At 16\" x 12\" x 4.1\", the Double (which I've been using) comfortably holds laptops up to 15 inches, which should be sufficient for most, and there are internal pockets for just about anything you can think of. There's also a somewhat clandestine pocket for either your cell phone or small personal items that you want to reach quickly.\n\nPracticality, in practice\n\nAll part of a balanced morning subway commute. Owen Burke/Business Insider\n\nThis is my commuter bag. I keep a thermos of tea, pens, a pad of paper, an orange, a glasses case or two, a computer and charger, and a magazine and a book in it. Still, as you might've gathered above, there's plenty of room for more.\n\nOne compartment for accessories and other doodads, and one for your laptop and pertinent files (we're professionals, remember) is about all you need, but then, on the other hand, I've successfully managed to turn this into a weekender bag with toiletries, a spare outfit (or two in the summer), and even a towel, among other things. I don't recommend it, but only for the sake of your shoulders and back; the bag, I assure you, can handle as much weight as you can pack into it.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nThis bag isn't cheap \u2014 $295, $325, or $350 is a lot to pay, especially for a bag made of nylon. That is, in part, why I was so hesitant to recommend it earlier. But, after a year of attempting to put it through wear and tear with no luck, I'm convinced it's worth it. You don't have to oil it, you don't have to worry about it getting wet, and you hardly ever have to clean it (the Cary hides dirt exceptionally well), which is not often the case with leather. This is high-grade nylon you might mistake for waxed canvas at a distance or at night (or just at first glance), and if you want to look professional without having to tend to high-maintenance leather, this is your new briefcase.\n\nPros: Sleek and professional look, water-resistant, high capacity, almost unfathomable durability\n\nCons: Pricey", "description": "With refined waterproof nylon and sleek leather straps, Stuart and Lau's Cary Briefcase is the ritzy-yet-rugged carry for any professional on the go.", "authors": ["Owen Burke"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d3b07c6a13c957758445d54-960-480.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
