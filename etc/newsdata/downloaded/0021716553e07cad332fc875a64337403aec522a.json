And goodness, isn\u2019t that lovely?\u201d", "description": "YouTuber Jessica Kellgren-Fozard has teamed up with emotional wellbeing organisation The School of Life to reveal her \u201csecrets to happiness\u201d in a short film narrated by philosopher and author Alain de Botton.", "authors": ["Olivia Petter"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/10/10/happiness2.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
