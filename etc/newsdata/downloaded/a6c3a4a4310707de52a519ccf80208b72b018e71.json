As a goodwill ambassador for the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR), Blanchett recently visited Bangladesh to meet stateless Rohingya who have fled Myanmar, and has met displaced Syrian families in the Middle East.\n\nWhen U.N. chief Antonio Guterres launched the #Ibelong initiative in 2014, during his time as head of the UNHCR, he described statelessness as a \"cancer\" that must be excised.\n\nBut the task ahead is monumental. Only about 200,000 people acquired citizenship during the first half of the campaign, barely making a dent in the overall number.\n\nAnd U.N. officials admit the total may now be even higher than in 2014 because of increasing displacement triggered by crises in Syria, Venezuela and elsewhere, which has raised the risk of many children growing up stateless.\n\nThere is also no solution in sight for many of the largest groups of stateless people including the Rohingya, hundreds of thousands of whom have fled to Bangladesh following an upsurge in violence.\n\nExperts on statelessness spoke of \"storm clouds on the horizon\" as forced displacement, xenophobia and populism complicate efforts to meet the 2024 deadline.\n\nThey are keeping a close eye on India, where 1.9 million people in the northeastern state of Assam have been left off a register of citizens, stoking concerns that many could become stateless.\n\nDOGS HAVE MORE RIGHTS\n\nPeople end up stateless for a host of historical, social and legal reasons including migration, flawed citizenship laws and ethnic discrimination. Others fall through the cracks when countries break up.\n\nAside from Myanmar, there are big stateless groups in Ivory Coast, Thailand, Nepal, Kuwait and some former Soviet countries.\n\nStateless people have previously told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that they feel stigmatised and forgotten.\n\n\"We've had people telling us, 'dogs are more important than I am',\" said Melanie Khanna, head of the UNHCR's statelessness section.\n\n\"People feel totally scarred and isolated. They often say, 'I thought it was just me'. It sends chills down your spine.\"\n\nDespite slow progress on reducing numbers, Khanna said there was far greater global awareness of statelessness than five years ago.\n\nAlmost all countries will be represented in Geneva, with more than 20 sending ministers. U.N. officials expect governments to make scores of pledges which will provide a roadmap for accelerating the campaign.\n\nIn July, Kyrgyzstan made history when it became the first country to officially end statelessness. U.N. officials believe Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Kazakhstan could also meet the 2024 deadline.\n\nThailand, where nearly 479,000 people are stateless, including members of ethnic hill tribes in the northern border regions, is also stepping up action.\n\nThe issue made international headlines last year during rescue efforts to save a young Thai football team trapped in a flooded cave.\n\nDuring the drama it emerged that several of the boys and their coach were stateless. They were granted citizenship after their ordeal.\n\n\n\n\n\nWIN-WIN\n\nBut resolving statelessness is not just a human rights issue. Statelessness has fuelled conflict and displacement in both Myanmar and Ivory Coast.\n\nKhanna said there was a growing recognition that resolving statelessness was a \"win-win\" because it was in governments' interests to have everybody feel invested in the society they live in and motivated to contribute.\n\nThe U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a set of global pledges on tackling poverty, inequality and other ills with an overall ambition to \"to leave no one behind\", have helped shift attitudes, Khanna said.", "description": "Film star Cate Blanchett will back a global campaign on Monday to end the plight of an estimated 10 million people with no nationality amid warnings rising xenophobia is stymieing efforts to meet a 2024 deadline for eradicating statelessness.
