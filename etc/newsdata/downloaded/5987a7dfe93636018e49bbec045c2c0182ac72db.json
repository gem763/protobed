Theo Walcott was also recalled having been knocked out against Manchester City in Everton\u2019s last game at Goodison.\n\nWest Ham left-back Arthur Masuaku was a replacement for Aaron Cresswell and he looked rusty in the early stages, a stray pass almost letting in Bernard and bringing a gesture of apology to team-mates from The Hammers defender.\n\nTheo Walcott kept the home momentum going with a sharp turn in the box before dinking a finish just past the far post with Roberto beaten.\n\nMarco Silva celebrated with coaching staff as Everton's win takes some of the pressure off the manager's shoulders\n\nAfter eight minutes, they were denied by the opening goal by an incredible piece of reflex goalkeeping by Roberto.\n\nBernardo\u2019s corner found Davies unmarked at the far post. From only five yards, the youngster should have buried the chance. He did make firm contact but Roberto was amazingly able to follow the flight of the ball from such close range and clawed the ball away.\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter. Everton took the lad after 16 minutes with a brilliant bit of improvisation from Bernard. Racing through to Walcott\u2019s clever pass, he initially seemed to have spurned the opportunity by turning away from goal.\n\nBut with West Ham thinking the immediate danger had passed he turned again, got the bounce of the ball to wriggle past Masuaku and then flicked his finish past Roberto from an acute angle.\n\nIn doing so, the little Brazilian became the first Everton player to score since Dominic Calvert-Lewin on September 1.\n\nGylfi Sigurdsson scored a trademark stunning goal after coming off the bench late on to double Everton's advantage\n\nVictory for Everton means they jump out of the relegation zone and are now just two points below West Ham\n\nEverton went for the second goal. Richarlison hit the outside of the post while Alex Iwobi and Walcott both tested Roberto from distance \u2013 the Hammers goalkeeper safely holding onto each effort.\n\nRicharlison dallied when he could have shot in the box and there were groans when he allowed Angelo Ogbonna to block his final effort.\n\nPoor Masuaku\u2019s poor first half ended up with cotton stuffed up a nostril to stop a nosebleed following a challenge. And visitor\u2019s boss Manuel Pellegrini will have been grateful to reach the interval only one goal behind.\n\nPellegrini acted at the interval by withdrawing Felipe Anderson for Andriy Yarmolenko. There could have been any number of West Ham players deserving of the chop.\n\nFelipe Anderson was unable to get any real grip on the game and was taken off at half time replaced by Andriy Yarmolenko\n\nYarmolenko made a quick impact and his square pass to Pablo Fornals deserved better than the Spaniard miscuing wide. Fornals almost made amends after 54 minutes but his quick-thinking half-volley from distance sailed narrowly over after trying to catch Jordan Pickford off his line.\n\nEverton responded with a Bernard free-kick whipped in just wide and Michael Keane\u2019s header saved by Roberto. Walcott then thundered a half-volley against the underside of the crossbar.\n\nPellegrini, who probably couldn\u2019t believe his side were still in the match after an hour, sent on Jack Wilshere for Fornals after 63 minutes.\n\nWest Ham players looked dejected after Bernardo's first half goal during their defeat at Goodison Park\n\nEverton remained the most dangerous side however. Sidibe\u2019s burst out of defence released Alex Iwobi who couldn\u2019t beat Roberto one-on-one. Diop then sliced a cross towards his own with the keeper deflecting over via his knee.\n\nWest Ham knew they\u2019d get one chance to snatch an equaliser and after 84 minutes, Sebastian Haller won a corner in the air and Issa Diop was denied from close range by alert goalkeeping from Jordan Pickford.\n\nThat was their last opportunity. Sigurdsson came on as a late substitute and showed his class immediately, rifling into the top corner from 22 yards.\n\nRicharlison was a constant menace all afternoon but could not add himself onto the score sheet for Everton", "description": "Bernardo and substitute Gylfi Sigurdsson scored the goals as Everton took a 2-0 victory over West Ham United.
