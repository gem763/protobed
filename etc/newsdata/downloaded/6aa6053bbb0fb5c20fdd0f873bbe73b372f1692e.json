An Oakland jury delivered a mixed verdict Thursday in a trial to determine responsibility for the fire that killed 36 people. (Lucy Nicholson/Reuters)\n\nAn Oakland jury delivered a mixed verdict Thursday in the trial to determine responsibility for a warehouse fire that killed 36 people during a nighttime concert nearly three years ago, acquitting one defendant of involuntary manslaughter and deadlocking over the fate of the second.\n\nAfter a three-month trial and jury deliberations that ran another five weeks, Max Harris was acquitted on all 36 counts, one for each of the victims who died trying to escape a sudden fire that burned through an artist collective known as the Ghost Ship. The jury could not come up with a verdict for Derick Almena, who managed the warehouse where about two dozen artists lived and worked.\n\nThe trial has been watched widely in Oakland and throughout California where sky-high housing costs, driven in part by rapid urban gentrification, have forced many residents to find unconventional ways to live.\n\nAs many as 25 people lived in the Ghost Ship at any one time, often in spaces that doubled as art studios, and practiced a twist on Satya Yuga, an ethos that is part Eastern religion and part artistic celebration. Oakland\u2019s cityscape has been remade in recent decades by Silicon Valley-driven housing demand and investment, and is part of the most expensive urban area to live in the nation.\n\nTestimony over months was alternately technical, delving into fire codes and safety requirements, to achingly emotional as parents recalled from the stand final text messages from children unable to escape the Dec. 2, 2016, fire.\n\nProsecutors argued that the two men were responsible for the deaths by failing to keep the warehouse up to fire code, endangering all of those who attended the concert. Defense attorneys suggested the fire was started intentionally \u2014 its official cause has never been determined \u2014 and that city officials knew about the dangerous conditions but failed to act.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m totally not satisfied,\u201d said Alberto Vega, the brother of one of the victims, Alex Vega, according to the East Bay Times. Vega died of smoke inhalation, as did the other victims.\n\nAlmena, 49, was the leaseholder of the building near a freeway overpass, a Wendy\u2019s drive-through, and the public transit system\u2019s Fruitvale Station, a neighborhood now in the midst of swift redevelopment.\n\nHe was not on site when the fire broke out, having been warned that the warehouse was not a suitable place to raise his young children.\n\nOf the dozen jurors, 10 believed Almena should be convicted with the other two dissenting. The split prompted Alameda County Superior Court Judge Trina Thompson to declare the jury \u201chopelessly deadlocked.\u201d\n\nThe process to begin Almena\u2019s retrial is scheduled to start early next month.\n\nHarris, 29, held the title of creative director at the building. He was present during the fire, managing to escape without injury.\n\nBut people who lived there testified during the trial that he had little authority over building rules and safety measures, casting Harris as the mercurial Almena\u2019s on-site assistant.\n\nHarris and his lawyers, Tyler Smith and Curtis Briggs, embraced on hearing the jury\u2019s first \u201cnot guilty\u201d verdict on the involuntary manslaughter counts. He and Almena both faced 39 years in prison if convicted.\n\nAfter the verdicts, Briggs suggested Oakland city officials should be held accountable for the Ghost Ship tragedy, failing to adequately manage housing demand and enforce fire codes.\n\n\u201cNot one city official had the courage to get on the stand and tell the truth,\u201d Briggs said, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.", "description": "One defendant was acquitted of manslaughter in the Oakland fire that killed 36, while the jury deadlocked on the other.", "authors": ["Scott Wilson", "Senior National Correspondent Focusing On California", "The West", "September At Pm", "Scott Wilson Is A Senior National Correspondent For The Washington Post", "Covering California", "The West.
