Or did he merely choose not to watch?\n\nGareth Southgate handled the subject carefully when asked about Maddison in Sofia\n\nIt is hard to work out which of the two explanations would irritate Gareth Southgate the most.\n\nThe England manager chose his words carefully when asked about the issue in Sofia on Sunday night.\n\nSouthgate knows how the media work and did not want Maddison\u2019s Friday excursion to overshadow what his team are trying to do in Bulgaria.\n\nBut Southgate will be livid, be sure of that. He has been unsure for some time about Maddison\u2019s attitude to his life and to his football.\n\nSouthgate listened to the messages that came out of the Under 21 camp after the summer\u2019s European Championship disappointment in Italy, for example, and they were not good.\n\nSo, for Maddison to be foolish and reckless now is hard to understand. The 22-year-old is not shy and there is nothing wrong with that. The England team need a player or two with a bit of a strut \u2014 all teams do.\n\nMaddison has broke into the senior England set-up after his fine form with Leicester City\n\nThose who know and work with Maddison at Leicester say he is a little misunderstood. They claim that beneath the uber-confidence is a decent enough lad waiting to get out.\n\nBut Maddison appears \u2014 from the outside at least \u2014 to be one of those young players who feels that talent alone will take him where he needs to go. If he does then he is wrong and he will probably find that out when Southgate\u2019s next squad is announced.\n\nIn that interview with Sportsmail a couple of weeks ago, Maddison made another categorical statement. \u2018I am not conscious of what other people think,\u2019 he said.\n\nIf he really wants to get on with club and country, then that has to change.", "description": "James Maddison told Sportsmail recently that if he ever got arrogant, his mum would give him a clip round the ear.\u00a0Maybe it\u2019s time he realises he now has obligations that extend beyond his family.", "authors": ["Ian Ladyman For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/21/19665230-0-image-a-42_1570998511533.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
