Leftist students on campus expressed outrage over their appearance and planned protests ahead of the event, marching across campus to stand up against \u201cNazis\u201d and \u201cwhite supremacy.\u201d\n\nActivists participated in interactive chanting: \u201cWhen black lives are under attack, what do we do?\u201d women on the megaphones asked.\n\n\u201cStand up, fight back,\u201d the crowd shouted back.\n\n\u201cWhen trans lives are under attack, what do we do?\u201d the women asked.\n\n\u201cStand up, fight back!\u201d the crowd continued.\n\nProtesters eventually moved to another side of the auditorium in order to \u201cface\u201d Don Jr. and chanted, \u201cWhose streets? Our streets!\u201d\n\nThe activists held signs reading, \u201cI am angry,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t spread hate,\u201d and \u201cDrain the swamp of white supremacy. Go back to Russia.\u201d\n\nOne activist held a puppet of a uterus, while another held up a bright pink sign featuring cartoonish depictions of President Trump. It read, \u201cI\u2019ll Grab Ya Daddy By The Pussy\u201d:\n\nOlivia Yoh, a senior at the university, stood with the campus\u2019s Republican group, countering the protesters with a cutout of the president\u2019s face with the caption \u201cNo collusion\u201d:\n\n\u201cPeople are mad he\u2019s coming here, because they feel like it\u2019s a campaign event,\u201d she told Breitbart News. \u201cBut honestly, we just view it as free speech, and we\u2019re happy to have him come here to finally have someone who shares our views on campus.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if the number of people against Trump\u2019s appearance outnumbered those in favor, she said, \u201cI think that the Democrats are much more outspoken about it, whereas Republicans are feeling kind of silenced by it.\u201d", "description": "Protesters gathered at the University of Florida ahead of Donald Trump Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle's appearance at the university.", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/UF-protest-0-1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
