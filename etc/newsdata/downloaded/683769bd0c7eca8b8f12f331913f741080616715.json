Her lawsuit seeks a judicial declaration that none of them co-authored \"Truth Hurts\" or have the right to share in the song\u2019s profits.\n\n\"The Raisens did not write any part of the material in question; they did not come up with the idea of including the lyric in the unreleased demo; they did not help Lizzo decide how to sing the lyric in the unreleased demo; and they do not co-own that work,\" the lawsuit said.\n\nIn her lawsuit, the singer and rapper from Detroit said that the brothers \"expressly withdrew any claim to 'Truth Hurts,' in writing,\" according to documents obtained by ABC News.\n\nLizzo's suit also states that \"The Raisens, moreover, embarked on an escalating campaign of harassment against Lizzo and others involved in \u2018Truth Hurts,\u2019 threatening to \u2018go public\u2019 unless they receive an unwarranted share of this work.\"\n\nSteven Ferdman/Getty Images, FILE\n\nLizzo has also alleged that Raisen\u2019s music publisher, Kobalt Music Publishing, wrote in an email to her representatives, \"I have been advised by our clients to withdraw our claims to this work.\"\n\nSpeaking to Pitchfork, however, the Raisens denied Lizzo's claim that they withdrew their claim, stating that neither signed paperwork to do so.\n\n\"After reaching out to [\u2018Truth Hurts\u2019 co-writer and co-producer] Ricky Reed and Lizzo\u2019s team about fixing it, we put the song in dispute in 2017 when it came out. We\u2019ve tried to sort this out quietly for the last two years, only asking for [five percent] each but were shutdown every time,\" they told the publication.\n\nBoth brothers continued to post denials on their Instagram pages. A representative for Rothman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThis week, \"Truth Hurts\" tied the record for the most weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for a rap song by a female artist, equaling the mark of seven weeks at the top of the chart in 2014 by Iggy Azaela's \"Fancy,\" featuring Charli XCX.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
