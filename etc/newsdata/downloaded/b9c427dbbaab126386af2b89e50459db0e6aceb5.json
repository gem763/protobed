Gaetz: \u2018Sickening\u2019 That Dems Attack Us for Being \u2018White Men\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "On Thursday, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) responded on \u201cMSNBC Live\u201d to a clip of Rep. Jackie Speier (D-CA) referring to him and the group of House GOP members that shut down a House Intelligence Committee hearing the previous day by entering the room where committee members were questioning the Defense Department\u2019s Laura Cooper as part of the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.\n\nGaetz slammed Speier\u2019s comments, which echoed remarks made by CNN analysts on Thursday, saying it is continued \u201cidentity politics from the left\u201d that they use in their arguments.\n\n\u201cWhat does the fact that we are white men have to do with our desire to represent the millions of constituents we serve?\u201d Gaetz asked. \u201cI was deeply offended by that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen Jackie Speier walks in a room I don\u2019t sit there and say, you know, a white woman came in or when someone of a different race or ethnicity comes in,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis is the type of identity politics from the left that seems to permeate any substantive or procedural argument that they make. And it\u2019s sickening to me that that is how we would be thought of. The people we serve are diverse and \u2026 it\u2019s really kind of sickening.\u201d\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent", "description": "On Thursday,\u00a0Rep.
