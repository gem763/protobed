(Bria Webb/Reuters)\n\nThe editor of New York University\u2019s independent student-run newspaper, Washington Square News, pulled an advertisement for National Review editor Rich Lowry\u2019s upcoming book from the paper because exposure to the ad may have \u201cmarginalized people of color,\u201d according to a statement released Thursday.\n\nLowry purchased the ad in order to promote a talk he will deliver Thursday night at NYU on his new book, The Case for Nationalism: How It Made Us Powerful, United, And Free, which will be released on November 5th.\n\nThe paper\u2019s business team accepted the ad and charged Lowry for its placement last week. He found out that it would not appear in the paper\u2019s Monday edition only when he saw that his payment had been refunded.\n\nWhen no explanation was forthcoming, Lowry wrote a post informing National Review readers that his ad, which \u201cinvited people to learn why their pre-conceptions about nationalism are incorrect,\u201d had been pulled without justification.\n\nIn response, the Washington Square News editor explained that she had unilaterally decided to pull the ad in order to shield \u201cpeople of color on campus\u201d from exposure to the phrase \u201cNationalism is a good thing,\u201d which, in keeping with the book\u2019s topic, was placed prominently at the top of the page.\n\n\u201cOn Sunday night during our weekly print production of the paper, I decided to pull the ad from the issue. The ad\u2019s pro-nationalist message does not align with the values of our paper, and after much thought, it was my decision to cancel it,\u201d the paper\u2019s editor said. \u201cThe word \u2018nationalism,\u2019 as it exists in today\u2019s political lexicon, connotes xenophobia and white supremacy, and printing it in large letters on the back of our paper would have marginalized people of color on our campus and our staff. I prioritized the sensibilities and trust of our audience over the ad revenue, and I stand by my decision.\u201d\n\nLowry responded to the statement on Twitter Thursday afternoon, arguing that the editor\u2019s contention that nationalism is inherently linked to \u201cxenophobia and white supremacy\u201d represents a \u201clazy misunderstanding\u201d and, ironically, illustrates the book\u2019s relevance to the contemporary political environment.\n\nOne wonders if anyone at NYU is allowed to mention that Alexander Hamilton, Henry Clay, Abraham Lincoln, and TR were all nationalists, or if this would be too triggering \u2014 Rich Lowry (@RichLowry) October 24, 2019\n\nThis poisonous and lazy misunderstanding of the word nationalism\u2013and the idea behind it\u2013is why I wrote the book, and why people inclined to reflexively reject it should pause and actually listen \u2014 Rich Lowry (@RichLowry) October 24, 2019\n\nElsewhere in his statement, the editor explained that her decision to pull the ad was made without consultation with the administration or anyone else \u2014 and added that ads are only retroactively pulled under the most extreme circumstances.\n\n\u201cRemoving ads from the paper last minute is not a standard practice \u2014 in fact, it almost never happens,\u201d she said. \u201cI made a judgment call while my colleagues on the business side of the paper were asleep, and we have put practices in place to ensure that an ad of this nature does not again get so far along in the process before being canceled.\u201d", "description": "The editor of New York University's independent student-run newspaper pulled an advertisement for National Review editor Rich Lowry's upcoming book.", "authors": ["Jack Crowe", "Ilya Shapiro", "Tobias Hoonhout", "Kevin D.
