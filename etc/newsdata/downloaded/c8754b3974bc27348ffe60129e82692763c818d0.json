After all, the \u201cScience Guy\u201d has a lot of experience making the case for climate action on TV.\n\n\u201cOh god,\u201d Nye says when I bring up the appearance he made on Tucker Carlson\u2019s show a couple of years ago. As one headline put it at the time, \u201cBill Nye appears on Fox News and it doesn\u2019t go well.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe experience was just a lot of adrenaline,\u201d Nye tells me. He was in Washington, D.C., where Carlson tapes his show. \u201cIt was a beautiful night, gorgeous, and Tucker Carlson was on the roof of the building doing his schtick from there.\u201d Fox invited him on to talk about climate change and he agreed, making his first appearance on that network in nearly a decade despite being a semi-frequent presence on CNN and MSNBC.\n\n\u201cSo we were going to go on the roof, beautiful night, this will be fun,\u201d Nye thought to himself. But then the producers told him he wasn\u2019t going to be on the roof with the host but rather in a small room on a lower floor of the same studio. \u201cThey moved me, changed my chair three times to throw me off,\u201d he says.\n\nDuring his introduction, Carlson mocked his guest as \u201cBill Nye the Psychoanalyst Guy\u201d for claiming that climate change deniers suffer from \u201ccognitive dissonance.\u201d The host was clearly itching for a fight.\n\nAs the segment began, Nye quickly realized that every time he started to talk, Carlson would interrupt him. \u201cWorking as fast as I could, I took my phone out and tried to show him with a stopwatch that he interrupted me every six seconds,\u201d Nye says. \u201cSo it\u2019s hard to make a point with him.\u201d\n\nBy the end of their nine minutes on screen together, Carlson was shouting at Nye, \u201cI\u2019m open-minded, you are not!\u201d\n\n\u201cCarry on, Mr. Carlson, I\u2019m sure we will cross paths again,\u201d Nye told him, a bit ominously. They haven\u2019t crossed paths since.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s really drifted off, with respect,\u201d Nye says of Carlson, who has become the most prominent white nationalist voice on Fox News under President Trump. \u201cI mean he\u2019s gotten odder and odder.\u201d Besides the racism, Nye was enraged by a recent show in which he attacked the metric system.\n\n\u201cThe other thing I wonder about Tucker Carlson is, he\u2019s got four kids,\u201d Nye says, turning more serious. \u201cI just wonder how his children feel about climate change. They keep a pretty low profile. I wonder about it, because it much more difficult to meet a climate change denier who is young.\u201d\n\nNye had a much better time making a cameo on Last Week Tonight with John Oliver earlier this year. \u201cGod, that was a blast,\u201d he says of the sketch in which he lit a globe on fire to demonstrate the impact of climate change. As the longtime host of a children\u2019s program, he has spent most of his career communicating his message in a kid-friendly way. But on HBO, he got to scream, \u201cThe planet\u2019s on fucking fire!\u201d at the top of his lungs. \u201cIt was heartfelt!\u201d he says.\n\nAnd yet Nye does not regret his attempt to get through to Fox News viewers on the climate crisis. \u201cI\u2019ll go back on there almost anytime,\u201d he says, explaining that he was asked back shortly after his original appearance but said no at the time and hasn\u2019t been invited since.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve offered to be on The Five and they wouldn\u2019t have me on,\u201d Nye adds of Fox\u2019s afternoon roundtable show. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be fun,\u201d he admits, \u201cbut you\u2019ve got to meet people where they are.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s all go fishing at the other guy\u2019s fishin\u2019 hole,\u201d Nye says, explaining that he means that literally as well as figuratively. \u201cBecause we\u2019re more alike than we are different.\u201d\n\nWhen I ask if that applies to him and Tucker Carlson, Nye sighs and replies, \u201cYeah, I guess.\u201d Like Nye, Carlson used to be famous for wearing bow ties on television. \u201cHe used to,\u201d Nye says of Carlson, \u201cbut he lost his nerve.\u201d\n\nNext week on The Last Laugh podcast: Stand-up comedian and host of Comedy Central\u2019s Good Talk, Anthony Jeselnik.", "description": "The \u2018Science Guy\u2019 says he\u2019s ready to go back on Fox News \u2018anytime\u2019 to make the case for climate action.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567117655/190830-wilstein-last-laugh-tucker-carlson-bill-nye-hero_mcpawp"}
