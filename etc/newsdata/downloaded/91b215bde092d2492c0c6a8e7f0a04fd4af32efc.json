Within about thirty seconds, Giuliani contradicts himself on whether he asked Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden as a representative of \u201cmy client.\u201d His client in this case just happens to be the American head of state, the man who might be running against Biden next year for a second term.\n\nSoooo \u2026 what was that promise Trump allegedly made to the Ukrainian president?\n\nCuomo to Rudy Giuliani: \"Did you ask the Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden?\" Rudy: \"No, I actually didn't\" [20 seconds later] Cuomo: \"So you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden?\" Rudy: \"Of course I did!\" pic.twitter.com/cuwTCvTcRn \u2014 Justin Baragona (@justinbaragona) September 20, 2019\n\nHe explained to host Chris Cuomo, \u201cI found out this incredible story about Joe Biden, that he bribed the president of the Ukraine in order to fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son.\u201d Cuomo asked Giuliani, \u201cDid you ask the Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden?\u201d \u201cNo, actually I didn\u2019t,\u201d Giuliani responded. \u201cI asked the Ukraine to investigate the allegations that there was interference in the election of 2016 by the Ukrainians for the benefit of Hillary Clinton \u2014\u201d Cuomo pressed him, \u201cYou never asked anything about Hunter Biden? You never asked anything about Joe Biden?\u201d Giuliani replied that \u201cthe only thing I asked about Joe Biden\u201d was to get to the bottom of how it was that the prosecutor who had been appointed to investigate Biden dismissed the case against him. \u201cSo you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden,\u201d Cuomo asked. \u201cOf course I did,\u201d said Giuliani.\n\nI\u2019m not sure which part of this made me laugh louder \u2014 Giuliani contradicting himself within a 30-second span, or Cuomo\u2019s later insistence that \u201cI\u2019m not biased!\u201d Come on, man. That also applies to Giuliani as well, especially with this answer to Cuomo when he asked Giuliani to produce documentation to corroborate his allegations against the Bidens:\n\nGiuliani questioned the motivations of the person who filed the complaint, saying they would be investigated by the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general. The conversation eventually returned to Biden, with the host questioning whether Giuliani could produce documents he had referenced to back up his allegations. \u201cWhy would I give the enemy the documents? \u2026 You are not fair and impartial. You are totally biased and your network is a creature of a Democratic National Committee,\u201d Giuliani claimed.\n\nIf that\u2019s true, then what in God\u2019s name is Giuliani doing on Cuomo\u2019s show? Why bother showing up at all? It\u2019s not as if CNN is the only outlet on which a Trump supporter can get any air time, after all. And it\u2019s not as if there isn\u2019t some smoke around the Bidens and Ukraine, either, including the use of official authority for personal benefit, as the New York Times reported in May:\n\nIt was a foreign policy role Joseph R. Biden Jr. enthusiastically embraced during his vice presidency: browbeating Ukraine\u2019s notoriously corrupt government to clean up its act. And one of his most memorable performances came on a trip to Kiev in March 2016, when he threatened to withhold $1 billion in United States loan guarantees if Ukraine\u2019s leaders did not dismiss the country\u2019s top prosecutor, who had been accused of turning a blind eye to corruption in his own office and among the political elite. The pressure campaign worked. The prosecutor general, long a target of criticism from other Western nations and international lenders, was soon voted out by the Ukrainian Parliament. Among those who had a stake in the outcome was Hunter Biden, Mr. Biden\u2019s younger son, who at the time was on the board of an energy company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch who had been in the sights of the fired prosecutor general.\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s not as if Giuliani\u2019s making this up out of whole cloth. Furthermore, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time that Ukraine has had a White House yank its chain over some personal benefit to the top two American constitutional officers. One has to wonder if Ukraine\u2019s leadership stays up late at night wondering what the heck a President Beto would need from them.\n\nNBC\u2019s Today show reminded us this morning that House Democrats had already taken an interest in Giuliani\u2019s attempts at legal diplomacy on behalf of the Trump campaign. That\u2019s not going to help Trump much in tamping down the speculation over the whistleblower complaint about his call with Ukraine\u2019s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, especially after last night\u2019s leaks that it had something directly to do with a Biden probe:\n\nTop House Democrats are already investigating whether Rudy Giuliani tried to influence the Ukrainian government to help the president\u2019s reelection campaign and investigate Joe Biden Giuliani contradicted himself when asked about investigating Biden during an interview last night pic.twitter.com/hJq1KhbFV0 \u2014 TODAY (@TODAYshow) September 20, 2019\n\nIn letters to the White House and State Department, top Democrats earlier this month demanded records related to what they say are Trump and Giuliani\u2019s efforts \u201cto coerce the Ukrainian government into pursuing two politically-motivated investigations under the guise of anti-corruption activity\u201d \u2014 one to help Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who is in prison for illegal lobbying and financial fraud, and a second to target the son of former vice president Joe Biden, who is seeking the Democratic nomination to challenge Trump\u2026 Lawmakers also became aware in August that the Trump administration may be trying to stop [military] aid from reaching Ukraine, according to a congressional official.\n\nActually, that sounds like Trump and Giuliani were employing Biden\u2019s own strategy. That doesn\u2019t make it acceptable, however; corruption is corruption, and the excuse that the other guy did it first isn\u2019t exactly a \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d response. This might swing a few more House Democrats into the impeach column over the weekend, assuming the complaint pans out for them \u2014 or assuming Giuliani keeps shooting his mouth off on national television. He\u2019s going to talk Trump out of office if Trump keeps him around much longer.", "description": "More fuel for House Dems' impeachment movement?", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Hot Air Staff"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cuomo-giuliani.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
