It appears only a deluge leading to soft ground would present a question he has yet to be asked.\n\nGodolphin is finishing the season on a high both on the racecourse and, earlier this week, in the sales ring. It has won the Middle Park with Earthlight, the Jean-Luc Lagardere with Victor Ludorum and the National Stakes with this colt. The Dewhurst would give it the clean sweep.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very exciting for us and for racing,\u201d said Pinatubo\u2019s trainer, Charlie Appleby on Friday. \u201cI\u2019m very happy with him. He\u2019s strengthened with each race since Ascot. He\u2019s not going 10 lengths clear on the gallops but he never has.\u201d", "description": "Pinatubo, Godolphin\u2019s unbeaten Shamardal colt who is already rated higher than Frankel at the same stage, can make it six out of six by winning the Darley Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket on Saturday.", "authors": ["Marcus Armytage", "Racing Correspondent", "Charlie Brooks", "Paul Hayward"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/racing/2019/10/11/TELEMMGLPICT000205176579-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqqe94gVf5fwATDoCZ63F3bFNnSTnP2MdInW5qSl1TD3U.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
