Kavanaugh.\n\n\u201cI call for the Resignation of everybody at The New York Times involved in the Kavanaugh SMEAR story, and while you\u2019re at it, the Russian Witch Hunt Hoax, which is just as phony!\u201d the president tweeted.\n\nHe added, \u201cThey\u2019ve taken the Old Grey Lady and broken her down, destroyed her virtue and ruined her reputation\u2026She can never recover, and will never return to Greatness, under current Management. The Times is DEAD, long live The New York Times!\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s comments come after the New York Times was forced to clarify its article, which was taken from an anti-Kavanaugh book by Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly.\n\nThe piece revisited allegations made by Deborah Ramirez, a college classmate of Justice Kavanaugh. She claimed during the justice\u2019s confirmation hearings last year that he thrust his penis at her during a party a college party.\n\nIn the article, The Times also leveled a new allegation of sexual misconduct and suggested the FBI probe was less than rigorous.\n\nSenate Republicans, though, rebuked the charge, saying both the committee and the FBI looked into Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s background.\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley, who served as chairman of the Judiciary Committee during the confirmation hearings, said his staff chased down eight people linked to Ms. Ramirez during the committee\u2019s probe into alleged misconduct \u2014 and never heard anything about the other incident alleged in The Times article.\n\n\u201cThis is not an allegation. It\u2019s barely a third-hand rumor. These writers didn\u2019t even speak to the man who they claimed originally recounted this rumor,\u201d the Iowa Republican said on the chamber floor. \u201cWhat\u2019s left is only layers and layers of decades-old hearsay.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
