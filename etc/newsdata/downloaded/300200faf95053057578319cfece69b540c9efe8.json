(AP) - Ever since Austin Ekeler joined the Chargers as an undrafted free agent two seasons ago, the remarkable running back has consistently found unexpected new ways to contribute to Los Angeles\u2018 offense.\n\nThe newest wrinkle last weekend: Lining up outside as a receiver and running slant routes.\n\n\u201cWe ran it twice,\u201d quarterback Philip Rivers said. \u201cI missed him once, and he caught the one. He\u2019s so versatile. He really is. You could say he\u2019s a running back playing receiver, or you could say he\u2019s a receiver playing running back. I think he\u2019s that special and has that much ability.\u201d\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s frightening to contemplate the potential state of the Los Angeles (2-5) offense this season without Ekeler, the Chargers\u2019 leading rusher with 248 yards and top pass-catcher with 49 receptions. Ekeler is even third in the entire NFL in receptions, and tops among running backs.\n\nEkeler started the season as the Chargers\u2019 first-string running back during Melvin Gordon\u2019s unsuccessful contract holdout, and he moved back into a hybrid role when Gordon returned to the team. Lining up as a slot receiver is a familiar assignment, but moving outside and running slants was something else entirely - and Ekeler still handled it with grace.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t run it in practice, ever, since I\u2019ve been here,\u201d Ekeler said. \u201cNot in a game. In college, I was always in the backfield. Here, it\u2019s never been drawn up for me. But (last Sunday) it was, \u2018Here, you\u2019re going to be outside. You\u2019ve got a five-step slant.\u2019 I can run it. Everyone can run it, but it was the first time in a game. So yeah, I made it work. But the more you can do. I\u2019ll expand if they\u2019ll allow me to. As long as I can continue to make plays with what they\u2019re giving me, I think you\u2019ll see me getting more routes.\u201d\n\nEkeler caught seven passes for 118 yards last week against Tennessee, including a 41-yarder for a touchdown in the fourth quarter. He also caught a pass over the middle and took it to the goal line for what was ruled a go-ahead touchdown with 39 seconds to play, only for replay officials to rule him down inside the 1 using criteria they still hadn\u2019t been able to explain to the Chargers three days later.\n\nThe Chargers lost the game when Gordon fumbled three plays later, sending LA to its fifth loss by seven points or fewer already this season - and its third loss in which a running back fumbled at the 1. The culprit was Ekeler in the first two instances. While his teammates praise his innumerable contributions, he still thinks about his mistakes.\n\n\u201cThis 1-yard-line stuff, man, it\u2019s literally the story of our season right now,\u201d Ekeler said with a grimace. \u201cWe\u2019ve been this close. \u2026 It\u2019s frustrating as a football team in general, especially on offense, and especially when you have the ball. When I fumbled the ball, it doesn\u2019t get any worse than that, as far as guilt. You just feel like you let your team down. So I know exactly how Mel felt.\u201d\n\nEkeler\u2019s positive plays far outnumber his mistakes, and his slick physicality provides a challenging counterpoint for defenses already attempting to game-plan against star receivers Keenan Allen and Mike Williams. The 5-foot-10 Ekeler has an impressive capacity for making tacklers miss in space, and his elusiveness has only increased this season, particularly when the Chargers get him in a favorable spot in coverage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just about getting people off their mark,\u201d Ekeler said. \u201cI\u2019m smaller and more compact, so I can change direction a little easier than linebackers can. It\u2019s not flashy, but it\u2019s effective.\u201d\n\nWhile Gordon hasn\u2019t played impressively since his return from the holdout, averaging just 2.3 yards per carry in his two games, Ekeler has only emphasized his own importance in the Chargers\u2019 offense. With left tackle Russell Okung returning from injury this weekend at Chicago, Ekeler and Rivers are hopeful they can get more production out of the Bolts\u2019 struggling running game.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re at our best when we\u2019re balanced,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cWhatever it means, that needs to be our No. 1 objective. I think that could be the answer to some of our questions, is scoring.\u201d\n\nNOTES: Okung probably won\u2019t play the entire game against the Bears, coach Anthony Lynn said. Trent Scott is also likely to play at left tackle, where he has spent the season. \u2026 Scott Quessenberry will start the week as the Chargers\u2019 starting center, but Lynn is also looking at Ryan Groy, who signed with Los Angeles two weeks ago. Groy played for the Buffalo Bills when Lynn was their running backs coach and offensive coordinator. \u2026 The Chargers put OG Forrest Lamp on injured reserve after he broke his leg at Tennessee. \u2026 With NT Brandon Mebane (knee) and DT Justin Jones (shoulder) missing practice Wednesday, the Bolts signed DT Sylvester Williams to replace Lamp on the 53-man roster. Williams is a seven-year NFL veteran who won a Super Bowl ring in Denver and spent the most recent preseason with New Orleans. \u201cI think bringing him on as depth can\u2019t do anything but help us,\u201d Lynn said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Ever since Austin Ekeler joined the Chargers as an undrafted free agent two seasons ago, the remarkable running back has consistently found unexpected new ways to contribute to Los Angeles' offense.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Greg Beacham"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/23/chargers_titans_football_75067_c0-203-4928-3077_s1200x700.jpg?78eafaa0fba112ae2267a8bb77aef85190ab6ed5", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
