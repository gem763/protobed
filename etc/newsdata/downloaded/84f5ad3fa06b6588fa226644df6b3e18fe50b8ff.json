Now, it\u2019s adding some Star Wars-themed cookware.\n\nThe array of products featured in the Star Wars x Le Creuset collection is impressive: there\u2019s a \u201cHan Solo in Carbonite\u201d roaster, a Porg pie bird (a ceramic bird you put in the middle of your pies to let the steam out while they\u2019re baking), Death Star and Millennium Falcon silicone trivets, Dutch ovens and mini cocottes that come in BB-8, R2-D2 and C-3PO finishes, and a Darth Vader Dutch oven.\n\nBe sure to watch the video below with the sound on because there\u2019s nothing funnier than some cookware being introduced to the most dramatic symphony music and some Darth Vader breathing sound effects.\n\nIntroducing the @starwars x Le Creuset Collection, available for purchase November 1st exclusively at select Le Creuset boutique stores, online, and from @yuppiechef.

There\u2019s no pricing information yet, but given that Le Creuset makes the holy grail of Dutch ovens that range anywhere from $200 to $300, we can expect the prices to be around that amount. But maybe if you wait around long enough, you\u2019ll be able to find the items on the shelves of your local TJ Maxx in a few months. Then you can use the Force \u2014 so you don\u2019t burn your caramelizing onions.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for something truly exclusive though, look no further than the $900 limited-edition Tatooine round dutch oven. It\u2019s hand-painted, and only nine of them will be made, to celebrate the \u201c9-part Skywalker Saga.\u201d You can sign up here to purchase it when it goes on sale, or you can save hundreds of dollars and just purchase a regular dutch oven and put two round stickers on them.\n\nUpdated October 4th, 2019 2:50PM ET: This story has been updated to include the Tatooine dutch oven.", "description": "The Star Wars x Le Creuset collection features a \"Han Solo in Carbonite\" roaster, a Porg pie bird, Death Star and Millennium Falcon silicone trivets, Dutch ovens and mini cocottes that come in BB-8, R2-D2, and C-3PO finishes, and a Darth Vader Dutch oven.", "authors": ["Dami Lee", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RPcKTtXjxpvcHRbBsSyuZG_mZLU=/53x0:1804x917/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19258954/le_crueset.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
