No, those words came from Morgan Stanley\u2019s prominent analyst Mike Wilson during an interview Wednesday on CNBC.\n\nBut where Maher wants a recession in hopes that it will lead to President Trump getting voted out of office, Wilson has his own reason.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m rooting for a recession in some ways because that\u2019s what would get the flush in terms of expectations that still has to happen,\u201d explained Wilson, one of Wall Street\u2019s most bearish strategists. \u201cThen we can have a cyclical recovery.\u201d\n\nHe said that if he saw companies start to fire people, he would get more bullish on the market because that would protect profit margins. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing I\u2019m looking for,\u201d Wilson told CNBC, adding that he doesn\u2019t see the S&P 500 breaking out of its current trading range soon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same set up we had this summer,\u201d he said. \u201cEarnings season\u2019s going to be mixed...
