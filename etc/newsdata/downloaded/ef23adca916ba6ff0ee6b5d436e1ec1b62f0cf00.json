The company said its sale of Keebler cookies and other brands, a deal that was completed in July, weighed on results compared with the third quarter last year.\n\nOn an organic basis, excluding currency fluctuations, mergers and asset sales, sales rose 2.4% in the quarter, Kellogg said.\n\nIn the U.S. and Canada, the food manufacturer said stronger demand for snacking products like Pringles and Cheez-It crackers boosted results. But sales of cereals fell, a decline Kellogg attributed in part to softness in the category. Snack sales rose 5% on an organic basis but fell by about the same amount for cereals.\n\nLong a breakfast staple, cereal has struggled in recent years as consumers have opted for more protein-heavy meals at the start of the day and fast-food chains have moved to expand their breakfast businesses.\n\nThe company reported a profit of $247 million, or 72 cents a share, compared with $380 million, or $1.09 a share, last year.\n\nAdjusted profit fell to $1.05 a share, but exceeded forecasts from analysts.\n\nKellogg's costs of goods sold rose about 3% in the quarter. Selling, general and administrative expense fell 6%.\n\nWrite to Micah Maidenberg at micah.maidenberg@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 29, 2019 08:55 ET (12:55 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
