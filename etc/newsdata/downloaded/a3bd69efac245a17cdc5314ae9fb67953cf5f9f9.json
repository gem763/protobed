The men were told the shelter was only for residents of Taito ward.\n\nOne of the men told the Asahi Shimbun newspaper that \u201cthe wing was strong and it was raining\u201d when he turned up at the shelter on Saturday morning.\n\nEvacuees were required to fill in a form with their name and address, but the 64-year-old was turned away after writing: \u201cI have no address.\u201d He instead spent the night huddled under an umbrella, under the awning of a building.\n\nA second homeless man was also denied access to the same shelter, which was set up at a primary school, that afternoon.\n\nTyphoon Hagibis made landfall on Saturday evening, bringing heavy rain and winds up to 140mph.\n\nMany people on social media condemned Taito authorities, with some denouncing their actions as a violation of human rights.\n\n\u201cIs this a country that\u2019s going to host the Olympics in Tokyo?\u201d tweeted one man. \u201cPeople from abroad would see this and think this is a terrible country.\u201d\n\nMr Abe, who was asked by an opposition MP about the incident, said shelters \u201cshould let anyone in who has come to evacuate\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe will look into the facts and take appropriate measures,\u201d he added.\n\nTaito ward said it would review its procedures to help people without addresses.\n\n\u201cWe deeply apologise that we dealt with people without addresses insufficiently so that they could not stay at the shelter,\u201d the mayor of the ward, Yukuo Hattori, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe will cooperate with related parties and consider measures to support all the people at the time of a disaster.\u201d\n\nThe controversy came as rescuers slogged through mud and debris in an increasingly desperate search for missing people as thousands of homes remained without power or water.\n\nFifteen people remain missing nearly three days after Typhoon Hagibis smashed into central and eastern Japan, national broadcaster NHK reported. More than 200 people were injured in the storm, whose name means \u201cspeed\u201d in the Tagalog language.\n\nThe highest toll was in Fukushima prefecture, north of Tokyo, where levees burst in at least 14 places along the Abukuma river, which meanders through a number of cities. At least 25 people died in Fukushima, including a mother and child who were caught in flood waters, according to NHK.\n\nAbout 133,000 households were still without water on Tuesday, while 22,000 had no electricity. The figures were down on the hundreds of thousands initially left without power but still a cause for concern in northern areas where temperatures are falling.\n\nRead more\n\nElderly woman falls from rescue helicopter as Japan hit by typhoon\n\nJoseph pays tribute to victims of Typhoon Hagibis after Japan win", "description": "A disaster shelter which turned away homeless people as a devastating typhoon approached has been widely criticised in Japan, where the death toll from the country\u2019s strongest storm in decades has climbed to 66.Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe promised an investigation after staff at the evacuation", "authors": ["Chris Baynes"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/NbcsVEl876UXDzjDRzga.g--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/f7d5bcbd2c0d6d5825736ab99ecf2767", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
