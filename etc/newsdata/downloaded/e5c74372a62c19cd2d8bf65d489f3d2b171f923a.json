The population in Idlib is living under bombs, [and] children are being killed. It\u2019s vital that the ceasefire agreed in Sochi is put into practice,\u201d Macron told Putin.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron (R) meets with Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin at his summer retreat of the Bregancon fortress on the Mediterranean coast, near the village of Bormes-les-Mimosas, southern France, August 19, 2019.

The Syrian government says the Israeli regime and its Western and regional allies are aiding Takfiri terrorist groups that are wreaking havoc in the country.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Author Details"], "top_image": "https://www.veteranstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ScreenHunter-182-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-19"}
