It started at 5:00 PM ET and will run for seven hours. The focus, of course, is the 2020 Democratic candidate's solutions for what the left believes is America's number one issue -- climate change. But, what are the environmental impacts of this town hall? According to a 2011 British study, CNN will likely emit 8.2 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per hour via the production of the television special alone.\n\nThe BBC released the study after researching how many tons of carbon dioxide emissions were produced per hour by its station:\n\nCarbon Visuals was commissioned by the BBC to produce a set of images and a real-time animation showing the emissions resulting from one hour of TV programming. The data was provided by about 80 productions that were the first to use the Albert calculator at the BBC. This animation was created for the BBC and shows the real-time emissions associated with making one hour of broadcast ready production - equivalent to about 8.2 tonnes of carbon dioxide.\n\nAccording to the network, \"This is roughly equivalent to the annual emissions associated with space heating, heating and lighting for a pair of semi-detached houses (figures provided by the BBC).\"\n\nSo, based off this study, CNN will produce 57.4 tons of carbon dioxide emissions while warning about increasing carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nIt could be argued these numbers are outdated so perhaps the exact figure is off, but one thing that cannot be argued is that America is leading the world in carbon emissions reductions.", "description": "Seems like a waste of time for everybody. .10/02/2019 12:22:39PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Cortney O'Brien", "Guy Benson", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/211/d83700ac-0237-4fd0-9800-a7c49ffc9e15.png"}
