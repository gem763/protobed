Each of the companies involved had to pledge $10m (\u00a38m) into a common pot to join.\n\nPayPal did not give a reason for leaving the project. It said in a statement: \u201cPayPal has made the decision to forgo further participation in the Libra association at this time and to continue to focus on advancing our existing mission and business priorities as we strive to democratise access to financial services for underserved populations.\n\nQuick guide What is Libra, Facebook's new cryptocurrency? Show Hide What is Libra? Facebook says Libra is a 'global currency and financial infrastructure' - a digital asset built by Facebook and powered by a new Facebook-created version of blockchain, the encrypted technology used by bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The name Libra comes from the basic Roman measurement of weight. The abbreviation lb for pound is derived from Libra, and the \u00a3 symbol originally comes from an ornate L in Libra. Why is Facebook launching a cryptocurrency? Facebook claims it wants to reach the 1.7 billion people around the world who do not have access to a bank account. Who is in charge of Libra? Facebook is likely to run into regulatory hurdles and antitrust concerns. The currency will be serviced by a collective of companies called the 'Libra Association'. It functions as what is known as a 'stablecoin', pegged to existing assets like the dollar or euro, in the aim of making it less subject to the volatility that many cryptocurrencies experience. The Libra Association is described by Facebook as an independent, not-for-profit organisation based in Switzerland. Within the Libra Association will be a governing body called the Libra Association Council, comprised of a representative of each member of the association, which will vote on policy and operating decisions. Facebook claims that although it created the Libra Association and the Libra Blockchain, once the currency is launched in 2020 the company will withdraw from a leadership role and all members of the association will have equal votes in governance of Libra. The companies who contributed a minimum of $10m(\u00a38m) to be listed as founding members of the Libra Association include tech companies such as PayPal, Ebay, Spotify, Uber and Lyft, as well as financial and venture capital firms such as Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital, Visa and Mastercard. On October 2019, PayPal became the first company to drop out, as the project continued to face queries from regulators around the world. How and when can I use it? When the cryptocurrency launches, users can download Calibra, a digital wallet, that will allow them to send it to anyone with a smartphone. It will be available in Messenger, WhatsApp, and as a standalone app. It is not clear which countries the coin will launch in first, though Facebook said 'almost anybody' in the world with a smartphone will be able to download the app. Kari Paul in San Francisco Photograph: Chesnot/Getty Images Europe\n\n\u201cWe remain supportive of Libra\u2019s aspirations and look forward to continued dialogue on ways to work together in the future. Facebook has been a longstanding and valued strategic partner to PayPal and we will continue to partner with and support Facebook in various capacities.\u201d\n\nPayPal is not the only company thought to be having second thoughts about involvement. A Wall Street Journal report last week named Mastercard and Visa as companies reconsidering their position before a meeting on 14 October with representatives from the companies involved.\n\nSince that report, Visa\u2019s chief executive pointed out that any involvement was only provisional. Al Kelly told investors: \u201cNo one has yet officially joined. We\u2019re in discussions and our ultimate decision to join will be determined by a number of factors, including obviously the ability of the association to satisfy all the requisite regulatory requirements.\u201d\n\nLibra has been under increasing scrutiny from regulators, particularly in Washington and Brussels, where the project is seen as an attempt to bypass rules on topics ranging from money laundering to tax evasion.\n\nThe French government has said it would block the development of Libra in the EU, while US regulators have suggested the financial underpinnings of the currency, which will involve pegging the value of one Libra against a basket of currencies held in reserve, could bring the project under the auspices of securities regulators.", "description": "Payments company becomes first to withdraw from controversial digital project", "authors": ["Alex Hern", "Joseph Stiglitz"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c916117ae28bd8fc2db10be8aaf7019b6bff5b31/0_222_5058_3035/master/5058.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=99dd27369ab136787f0daac39c461e9b", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
