He previously published the children\u2019s books Your Baby\u2019s First Word Will Be Dada and Everything is Mama.\n\n\u201cI did the first one as a goof, like, Your Baby\u2019s First Word Will Be Dada, just trying to get my kid to say \u2018dada\u2019 first,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat happened is kids started reading back to their parents and they loved reading, so I was like, \u2018This is pretty cool.\u2019\u201d\n\nFallon is parent to Winnie, 6, and Frances, 4, with wife Nancy Juvonen, and has enjoyed reading with his daughters since they were young. He said Winnie and Frances approve of the new book.\n\n\u201cThey loved it,\u201d the star said. \u201cI put it out on the table just to see if they would like it, and they totally started reading it. Winnie\u2019s six now and Frannie\u2019s four-and-a-half, it\u2019s happening so fast, so she\u2019s reading. It\u2019s so cute, it\u2019s great.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been reading to them since they were babies \u2014 they couldn\u2019t even understand anything.
