He was absolutely loved by the people he represented. He understood the benefit of preserving Baltimore\u2019s history for current generations and future generations.\u201d\n\n'America lost a giant': Elijah Cummings' sudden death prompts warm tributes Read more\n\nDaniels recalled meeting Cummings, who died suddenly on Thursday at 68, at an National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) dinner in 2014. \u201cHe reminded me of a wise father figure. He wasn\u2019t in it for the politics; he was in it for the people. You could see he really cared about Baltimore.\u201d\n\n\n\nOthers noted how Cummings had risen to national significance, particularly during Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. In July Trump derided Baltimore as \u201ca disgusting rat and rodent-infested mess\u201d, that \u201cno human being would want to live there\u201d.

It makes me think about what he said to push back against Trump.\u201d She cited Cummings\u2019 recollection of having told Trump: \u201cMr President, you\u2019re now seventysomething, I\u2019m sixtysomething. Very soon you and I will be dancing with the angels. The thing that you and I need to do is figure out what we can do \u2013 what present can we bring to generations unborn?\u2019\u201d\n\nAtkinson added: \u201cI think it\u2019s a big blow for Baltimore. Most importantly right now, it\u2019s national policies that matter. He was representing us in Baltimore but also in an incredibly important job on the House oversight committee.\u201d\n\nOther residents told how Cummings touched their lives. Tony Jernigan, 47, a taxi driver and e-commerce trader, said: \u201cMy 16-year-old son texted me to say he died, so he was the kind of person the younger generation were sensitive to.\n\n\u201cHe was a big voice, a big personality, very young to be dying. For a politician, he seemed to be a genuine guy. He was about the disadvantaged person and the working class. He had his beef with Trump but he was always there on the frontline. He was seen around the city.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Elijah Cummings encourages protesters to comply with a 10pm curfew after unrest over the death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore, Maryland, on 29 April 2015.

Enrica Jang, the executive director of the Edgar Allan Poe House & Museum, said: \u201cHe was very beloved here and will be missed. When someone so charismatic passes away, there\u2019s a vacuum and a void there. It\u2019s such a precarious time and how can you find people to step into his shoes?\u201d\n\nThere were tributes in the Baltimore Sun newspaper. The columnist Dan Rodricks wrote: \u201cBaltimore could be so much better than it is, he said, if we could just get the schools up to speed, just get more kids into summer jobs, find employment for ex-offenders coming home from prison. He sponsored job fairs every year. He used to call me to suggest subjects for the column, and they were always about people or programs that were already quietly trying to make Baltimore a better city.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd David Simon, an author, journalist and the creator of The Wire, tweeted: \u201cI remember Elijah Cummings as a delegate from the 39th District in the General Assembly, a junior member of the old Mitchell organization. He outlasted that machine and so many other ambitious politicians and he did it by being a good man and a committed civil servant.
