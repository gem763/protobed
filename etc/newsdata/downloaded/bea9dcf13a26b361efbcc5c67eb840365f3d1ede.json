Complaint karke dikha, fir dekhiyo kya karta hun main\". (Do whatever you want, complain against me and then see what I will do to you).\"\n\nThe post accusing him of harassing her ruined his life overnight and in just three-day he was tagged a criminal and Dilli ka Darinda.\n\nDon't Miss 29.5 K SHARES 21.2 K SHARES 10.5 K SHARES 4.4 K SHARES 2 K SHARES\n\nTwitter\n\nDelhi Police proceeded to arrest Sarvjeet within a days time with no attempt was made to get the other side of the story.\n\nAccording to reports, Sarvajeet's life was ruined to such an extent that he couldn't find a stable job due to his \u2018criminal record\u2019.\n\n\u201cSoon after the incident, the company I was working with asked me to leave. We used to produce labels for branded clothes and had international clients. My boss told me that the company\u2019s name was being tainted as the news had spread to our international clients as well,\" the Print quoted him as saying last year.\n\nWhat's even more shocking is that during the course of his court trials Jasleen wasn't present in even one and her family always used the excuse that she moved to Canada after the 'molestation incident.'\n\nNow, 4 years after the incident, Sarvjeet Singh has been acquitted and he shared a post announcing the same with immense relief.\n\nHe wrote, \"The Verdict is out. I am ACQUITTED! I wish to thank Waheguru ji for keeping His eye on me, and all of you for your tremendous support. My friends and well-wishers made it possible.\"\n\n\"Most of all, my mother who stood by me like a pillar. Her faith in me was the major driving force that made me see each day with courage. And of course, Shikha Khanduja Kaul who has guided me through this. She is like an elder sister I never had. The book she has written on my case will be out soon!\"\n\nShikha Khanduja Kaul who wrote a book on his case shared a post which said that Justice finally prevails over fake feminism.", "description": "For four long years Sarvajeet Singh Bedi has been wearing the tag of a sexually harrasser after being falsely accused by a Delhi college student in a Facebook, The post where she claimed Singh made lewd comments went viral instsntly after which he was arrested.
