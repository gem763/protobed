This past week saw a worldwide week of protests organised by the group.\n\nOn Tuesday, Queensland Police were forced to negotiate with a climate change activist who had suspended himself in a hammock below Brisbane\u2019s Story Bridge. The group also staged a mass protest to disrupt Melbourne\u2019s CBD last month and is also planning a nude march for later this week.\n\nDeliberately obstructionist (kind of the point of protest), Extinction Rebellion has provided plenty of content for Australia\u2019s mainstream media as well as its conservative government. Palaszczuk succumbing to pressure to come down hard on the group will be seen as a win by conservative operatives within Australia\u2019s right.\n\nInitially introduced two months ago, the laws would have taken months to be enacted if they were not fast tracked and likely wouldn\u2019t have been made a reality in 2019.\n\nPolice Minister Ryan reportedly wrote to Parliament\u2019s Legal Affairs Committee to fast-track the laws, which would see protestors face as many as two years jail if they use \u201cdangerous devices\u201d like drums with concrete and locks that could be used on bridges and roads.\n\nQueensland Police will also have increased powers to search people they suspect are carrying dangerous objects.\n\n\u201cI say to protestors\u2026 \u2018what if it was your mother or grandmother that was held up from getting to hospital because of your actions, blocking streets,?\u201d said Palaszczuk.\n\nJust last week, the Queensland premier was dragged over the coals by radio shock jock Ray Hadley and home affairs minister Peter Dutton. Both influential conservatives called on Palaszczuk to introduce harsher punishment for protestors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to get these laws passed,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will bypass the normal submissions period and get them promulgated within days.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Brad Esposito"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-463917694.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
