REUTERS/Ann Saphir\n\n\u201cThis feels very sustainable,\u201d Powell said in Denver at the annual meeting of the National Association of Business Economics.\n\n\u201cClearly things are slowing a bit,\u201d he said, noting that it\u2019s normal for long expansions to have such periods. Twice in the 1990s, he said, the economy similarly downshifted, only to gain steam once the Fed cut interest rates a few times.\n\nThe Fed two interest rates this year, in July and September, were made in that spirit and have helped maintain a \u201cfavorable\u201d outlook for jobs and inflation, Powell said. The U.S. economy \u201cmay just be gathering itself - there\u2019s no reason why the expansion can\u2019t continue,\u201d he added.\n\nPowell noted recent data revisions showed less job growth in the year to March than previously estimated, turning a \u201cbooming\u201d market into one of moderate growth.\n\nOther recent economic data, including a possible contraction in manufacturing, add to the sense of reduced momentum.\n\n\u201cIt seems that Powell is trying to, in a soft way, demonstrate to the market that the Fed continues to be aware of the downside risks and is actively willing to support the economic expansion as needed,\u201d said Jason Ware, chief investment officer at Albion Financial Group in Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nNOT QE\n\nPowell also used his speech to let markets know the central bank would soon begin allowing its balance sheet to expand to ensure smoother functioning of U.S. short-term funding markets.\n\nRecent spikes had raised concern that banks had an inadequate supply of reserves to manage occasional periods of high demand, and Powell\u2019s remarks on Tuesday suggested the central bank was coming around to that view and would start buying Treasury bills to replenish reserves.\n\nThis move, he emphasized several times, would be technical, had no bearing on monetary policy and \u201cin no sense\u201d was the same as the bond-buying the Fed conducted in the aftermath of the financial crisis to ease monetary policy.\n\nU.S. Treasury prices rose after Powell\u2019s comments on the balance sheet, while stocks pared losses.\n\nREADY FOR ANOTHER CUT?\n\nAt separate events elsewhere, two other U.S. central bankers signaled their support for more policy easing.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind another cut. I could see it either way,\u201d Chicago Fed President Charles Evans told the Rotary Club in Chicago.\n\n\u201cIt would help for a little more insurance. Is it necessary and essential? I\u2019m not sure. But I\u2019m certainly open minded to those arguments,\u201d said Evans, who supported both Fed rate cuts this year to help the Fed faster achieve its 2% inflation goal.\n\nIn St. Cloud, Minnesota, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said he was \u201cgenerally in favor\u201d of lower interest rates, but, \u201cI don\u2019t know how much lower they should go.\u201d\n\nOne issue, he said, is how difficult it is to estimate the effect of trade wars on economic growth. \u201cIt\u2019s almost, your guess is as good as mine,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s September rate cut, to a target range of 1.75% to 2.00%, drew three dissents out of 10 votes, two from policymakers who believed the Fed should not ease policy at all, and one from St. Louis Fed President James Bullard who wanted a bigger, half-point interest-rate cut.\n\nAmong the seven nonvoting policymakers, at least a couple also disagreed with the move, including Kashkari who had sided with Bullard.\n\nTraders of short-term interest-rate futures are currently pricing in more than an 80% chance of a third interest rate cut this year when the Fed next meets, Oct. 29-30. Traders see a 40% chance of a fourth rate cut in December.\n\n\u201cWe will be data dependent, assessing the outlook and risks to the outlook on a meeting-by-meeting basis, Powell said, repeating that as global risks evolve the Fed would move \u201cas appropriate\u201d to keep the decade-old expansion under way.\n\n\u201cLooking ahead, policy is not on a preset course,\u201d he said.\n\nMuch of Powell\u2019s speech centered on how a \u201cdata dependent\u201d Fed sometimes struggled to be sure it has statistics that accurately inform it about the state of the economy.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell holds a news conference following a closed two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting in Washington, U.S., September 18, 2019. REUTERS/Sarah Silbiger\n\nMismeasurement of productivity may have actually understated growth in gross domestic product in recent years, Powell said. More significantly, the revisions to the employment data showed the economy added fewer jobs than previously estimated - a fact that could bolster arguments made by some Fed officials that there is ample \u201cslack\u201d left in the economy and thus room for lower rates.\n\nThe use of \u201cbig data\u201d may help produce more accurate real-time employment measures in the future, Powell said. But in the meantime the revisions meant that \u201cwhere we had seen a booming job market, we now see more-moderate growth.\u201d", "description": "Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday flagged openness to further rate cuts to fend off global economic risks, repeating that the central bank will act \"as appropriate\" amid an economy that he said is likely to continue to expand.", "authors": ["Howard Schneider", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438586233&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF971RY", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
