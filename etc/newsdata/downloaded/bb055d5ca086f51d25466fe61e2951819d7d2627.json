They were close friends for more than a decade before they became a couple\n\nWhen Dee and Joe became neighbours in 1973, it wasn\u2019t love at first sight. \u201cHe moved in to my block of flats with his wife and their two children,\u201d says Dee, who was a single mother at the time. \u201cI didn\u2019t see him in a romantic way.\u201d There were a lot of young families in this block in south-west London and it was a tightknit community. \u201cWe were neighbours first,\u201d says Joe. \u201cThen we became friends. It was a really nice place to live.\u201d A year later Dee met a new partner and moved to a house nearby, but they never lost contact. \u201cJoe and I stayed friends and we\u2019d often take the children out for meals.\u201d\n\nThe relationship remained platonic, but Joe says it was clear they enjoyed doing the same things. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t romance but we were always happy going out as a group with our families,\u201d he says. \u201cI worked shifts for London Underground, so I\u2019d often take her boys out when I wasn\u2019t working.\u201d Dee went on to have two more children with her new partner, never imagining that there could be anything more than friendship between her and Joe.\n\nBy the early 1980s, Dee\u2019s mum had became unwell and moved in with her. To help the family, Joe came over to do the gardening.\n\n\u201cAt the time I\u2019d gone back to college to take my A-levels and I think this really inspired Joe,\u201d says Dee. \u201cOne day he answered one of my essay questions and when I showed it to my tutor, she said: \u2018He should be doing a degree.\u2019\u201d Joe had never had the opportunity to complete his education, and believed that studying could open new doors. \u201cLife was OK, but I felt like I could achieve more. Dee really encouraged me with that in a way others hadn\u2019t.\u201d After completing his exams, Joe went on to further education and eventually trained as a social worker.\n\nWhen they began studying together, it became apparent that something in their relationship had shifted. \u201cI just looked at him one day and realised that I couldn\u2019t imagine my life without him.\u201d Both Dee and Joe had drifted apart from their partners, but were careful about exploring their new love. \u201cIt was a difficult situation and we kept getting together and breaking up for a while,\u201d says Dee. The pair finally became an official couple in 1987, when they both realised they wouldn\u2019t be happy unless they were together. Although it was a \u201cstrange transition\u201d from being friends, they\u2019ve never regretted it. \u201cJoe makes me laugh until my sides split. I always tell people if you want a really amazing relationship, be with someone who is your best friend.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dee and Joe Ansah with their family.

Although Joe has experienced racism all his life, this was a shock for Dee. \u201cWe had people saying a few rude things to us when we got together, which never happened when we were friends.\u201d\n\nDespite some difficult times, the pair have only grown closer over the years. \u201cI love that Dee is such a \u2018doer\u2019,\u201d says Joe. \u201cAny suggestion she makes I know it will be great. We\u2019ve been on a brilliant journey together.\u201d\n\nThe couple got married in 1995 and adopted a daughter seven years later. \u201cBetween us we\u2019ve got seven children, 13 grandchildren and two dogs, so we\u2019re always busy,\u201d says Dee. The pair are now in their 70s, but have no desire to slow down. They love travelling, spending time with their family and having new adventures. \u201cI love how Joe is so easy-going and always goes along with whatever I suggest,\u201d Dee says.\n\nThirty-two years since they got together, the romance is as strong as ever. \u201cIt always feels new and exciting to me, and I feel happy when I know I\u2019m going to see him,\u201d says Dee.\n\n\u201cAnd I always feel happy to see the dogs,\u201d laughs Joe. \u201cNo, I\u2019m just kidding. I always look forward to seeing Dee. We have amazing lives.\u201d\n\nWant to share your story?
