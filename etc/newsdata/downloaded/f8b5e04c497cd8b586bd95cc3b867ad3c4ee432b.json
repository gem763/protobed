She'll be sentenced on October 30.\n\nKatrice's furious sister Natasha Walker, 45, slammed the TV extra.\n\nSpeaking after the hearing, Mrs Walker said: \"I am relieved she has finally admitted guilt.\n\n\"I have put in a formal complaint to the police as I feel I have been treated disgustingly. It appears that if you commit a crime you are better supported.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"The impact this has had on my mental health has been pretty horrific. My feelings have never been taken into consideration.\"\n\nKatrice disappeared at a supermarket with her mother Sharon on an Army base in Paderborn, Germany, where her Sergeant Major father was stationed.\n\nAlmost four decades on, Katrice has not been found, despite a string of searches in the German town and an arrest being made last month in connection with the disappearance.\n\n(Image: Solent News & Photo Agency)\n\n(Image: Solent News & Photo Agency)\n\nRobinson has become the latest in a string of heartless people impersonating Katrice.\n\nBut the defendant, from Wirral, Merseyside, claimed she has suffered psychosis and genuinely thought she was Katrice.\n\nSpeaking after her case was adjourned, Robinson said: \"I actually believed completely that I was Katrice. I'd had mental health issues leading up to the situation.\n\n(Image: Solent News & Photo Agency)\n\n\"I was then at the time experiencing what I now know to be psychosis.\n\n\"I really didn't intend to hurt the family but as I know my actions have done that, I am deeply sorry and that is why I have pleaded guilty.\n\n\"I am now getting help and I apologise sincerely to the Lee family and my family.\"\n\n(Image: Portsmouth News/Solent News)\n\nThe Lee family have been critical of a string of failings by the Royal Military Police, who did not notify local hospitals of an eye condition the toddler had and only treated the case as a missing person inquiry.\n\nIn 2012, the Ministry of Defence apologised for its 'flawed investigations' and a review team was appointed to reassess the case.\n\nLast month, military police arrested and released without charge an ex-serviceman in connection with her disappearance and began searching a terraced house in Swindon, Wiltshire.", "description": "Heidi Robinson, who has a small part in Real Housewives of Cheshire, pretended to be Katrice Lee disappeared on her second birthday on November 28, 1981, in Paderborn, Germany", "authors": ["Bradley Jolly", "Image", "Julian Hamilton Daily Mirror", "Pa", "Solent News", "Photo Agency", "Portsmouth News Solent News"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20558565.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Heidi-Robinson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
