[Photo/VCG]\n\nThe quota for dual plates in Guangdong province and neighboring Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has been increased by 5,500, with an aim to further speed up the integration of the two prosperous regions.\n\nThe dual plates are required for private cars crossing the border using the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao bridge.\n\nOf the dual plates, 5,000 will be granted to car owners from Hong Kong, with the other 500 going to Guangdong vehicles.\n\nVehicle owners can apply for the dual plates starting Nov 18, according to a statement from Guangdong Provincial Department of Public Security on Friday.\n\nEligibility criteria include Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan or foreign investors with an accumulated tax of at least 100,000 yuan ($14,300) in Guangdong in the past three years.\n\nMeanwhile, authorities of Guangdong province have promised to simplify the procedures for car owners from Hong Kong and Macao.\n\n\"The move aims to help further expand exchanges and cooperation among Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao and better serve the building of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area,\" the statement said.\n\nZhang Guangnan, professor from the Center of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao Regional Studies with Sun Yat-sen University, said the increase indicates progress in infrastructural connectivity between the mainland and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region under \"the one country, two systems\" framework.\n\n\"Explorations have been continuously made in policy innovation and management of the bridge,\" Zhang told China Daily.\n\nLiang Haiming, chairman of Guangzhou-based China Silk Road iValley Research Institute, said the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge has not only helped boost exchanges and cooperation among residents in the three regions, but also benefited social and economic development.\n\n\"The bridge will help further boost the development of the shipping industry and build the southern Chinese region into an international innovation center as well, as Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao have China's aviation hub airports, major ocean ports and prestigious universities and scientific research institutes,\" Liang said.\n\nWitman Hung Wai-man, a Hong Kong deputy to the National People's Congress-the country's top legislature-welcomed the arrangement, saying it could facilitate more business exchanges between Hong Kong and Guangdong province, and further stimulate traffic volume on the bridge.\n\nHowever, Hung said the current practice, which sets a quota for certain private cars, might not maximize use of the quota as some private car owners don't travel across the bridge that often.\n\nHung said he has been promoting a daily appointment-based quota set according to temporary demand.\n\nBen Chan Han-pan, a Hong Kong legislator and vice-chairman of the Legislative Council's panel on transport, noted that over 30,000 private cars in Hong Kong can cross the bridge under regular or trial quotas.\n\nChan pointed out the quota has to unfold step by step in order to closely monitor its impact on traffic pressure in Lantau Island, where the bridge's Hong Kong exit and the Hong Kong International Airport are located.\n\nThe Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge, which is regarded as an engineering marvel, celebrated its first anniversary on Wednesday.\n\nThe world's longest cross-sea bridge includes a 6.7 kilometer tunnel beneath the water and a 22.9 km bridge spanning the sea at the mouth of the Pearl River, linking Hong Kong to the vast western part of the Pearl River delta.", "description": "The quota for dual plates in Guangdong province and neighboring Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has been increased by 5,500, with an aim to further speed up the integration of the two prosperous regions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/26/5db38006a310cf3e97a30aab.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
