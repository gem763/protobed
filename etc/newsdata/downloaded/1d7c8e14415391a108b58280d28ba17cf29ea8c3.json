Bonds of both firms rallied sharply, while Barclays Plc shares spiked as much as 7.2%.\n\nThe surge came after European Council President Donald Tusk said he\u2019d received \u201cpromising signals\u201d that a Brexit deal is possible, following talks between U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar. The pound rose as much as 2%.\n\nBritish banks have repeatedly said they are ready for any Brexit scenario. Still, RBS Chairman Howard Davies has also said there is \u201cconsiderable uncertainty and considerable nervousness\u201d in the U.K. economy. Some lenders have taken provisions to prepare for an economic slowdown and a surge in bad loans in event of a departure from the EU without a deal, and RBS is unlikely to hit profitability targets next year.\n\n\u201cAny deal is better than no deal,\u201d said David Herro, chief investment officer for international equities at Harris Associates, which owns 2.86% of Lloyds shares and 2.05% of RBS. \u201cCertainly Lloyds trades at a huge Brexit discount. And it\u2019s the same thing for RBS.\u201d\n\nBoth banks\u2019 shares trade below the levels seen before the EU referendum that set the course for Brexit in June 2016. RBS is also under pressure from the prospect of a new election, as Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour party, has considered halting disposals of the government\u2019s majority stake.\n\n\u201cAmid all the talk of a no-deal Brexit, the knee-jerk reaction to any sort of deal is positive,\u201d Allan Monks at JPMorgan Chase & Co. said in a note to clients. \u201cMany hurdles to a deal remain.\u201d\n\n(Updates with share price move, adds analyst quotes.)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Stefania Spezzati in London at sspezzati@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ambereen Choudhury at achoudhury@bloomberg.net, Marion Dakers, Keith Campbell\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- British bank shares jumped amid optimism that a U.K. deal to leave the European Union would support domestic lenders.Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc rose as much as 16.4% on Friday, the biggest intraday rise since May 2010, and Lloyds Banking Group Plc gained as much as 12.5%, its largest", "authors": ["Stefania Spezzati"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
