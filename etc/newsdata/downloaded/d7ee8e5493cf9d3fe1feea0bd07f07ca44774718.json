Leaked data included player IDs, birthdays, email addresses, and country of origin, according to multiple screenshots posted online.\n\nMy friend got a big pull in the Data Breach pack, Hashtag's own Algerian Arrow, @YaniOurabah.\n\n\n\nWe'll send you a birthday card.\n\n\n\nWhat a mess. pic.twitter.com/IYMT1ieq4g \u2014 George Hughes (@GeorgeHughes) October 3, 2019\n\nSo I\u2019m guessing I was affected by personal data leak from @EA? This is an absolute shambles.#FIFA20 @EAHelp pic.twitter.com/7jsEZUQ6HM \u2014 JREXX (@JIMMYJREXX) October 3, 2019\n\nEA claimed it took down the website 30 minutes after its launch, by which point around 1,600 had already registered.\n\nIt is unclear if someone mass-harvested this information, but the company's quick response might have prevented an attacker from doing so.\n\nEA said it's now contacting all players whose data was leaked.\n\n\"Player privacy and security are of the utmost importance to us, and we deeply apologize that our players encountered this issue today,\" the company said in a statement published on Twitter.\n\nAn update on the EA SPORTS FIFA 20 Global Series registration page issue from October 3. pic.twitter.com/t5R6HwYd3I \u2014 EA SPORTS FIFA (@EASPORTSFIFA) October 4, 2019\n\nHowever, some players are still mad at the company. Many argued that the leak of emails and player tags are an issue, as it would allow miscreants to tie a professional player with their real-world identity using information leaked on other sites, and which is freely available online.\n\nMany said they now feared getting doxed or swatted as a result. Swatting is a comment phenomenon in the gaming scene, and has resulted in the death of at least one innocent man.", "description": "Glitch in EA FIFA 20 tournament site accidentally leaked some players' data to other players.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/04/233be89a-268b-4e7a-8391-4f22c7403c60/thumbnail/770x578/b3dc6ee3853afd490a5d4e77ad813439/fifa20globalseries.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
