She actually swallowed it in her sleep.", "language": "en", "text": "A California woman says she dreamed about swallowing her engagement ring to protect it during a heist on a high-speed train. She later realized she actually did swallow her ring in her sleep.\n\nJenna Evans wrote about her ordeal in a Facebook post last week that has now gone viral. She explained she was having a vivid dream in which she and her fianc\u00e9, Bobby Howell, were in a \"sketchy situation\" involving a high-speed train and some \"bad guys.\"\n\n\"He told me I had to swallow my ring to protect it; so I popped that sucker off, put it in my mouth and swallowed it with a glass of water riiiight about the time I realized what I was doing,\" Evans said. \"I assumed this too was a dream, because WHO ACTUALLY SWALLOWS THEIR ENGAGEMENT RING, so I went back to sleep.\"\n\nSo, in case you missed it, I swallowed my engagement ring in my sleep on Tuesday night. I actually remember doing it,...

She says the doctor told her she would have to get a procedure to remove it, rather than waiting for it to pass through her system.\n\nShe went to a gastroenterologist and described feeling some pain with the ring inside. That's when she started to worry. \"At this point, I could definitely feel it in my guts, it was starting to really hurt and make us nervous.\"\n\nThe doctors retrieved the ring during an upper endoscopy procedure and gave it to Howell, making for a happy ending. \"Bobby finally gave my ring back this morning \u2014 I promised not to swallow it again, we're still getting married and all is right in the world,\" she said.", "description": "Jenna Evans dreamed she had to swallow her ring to protect it from \"bad guys\" \u2013 except it wasn't just a dream", "authors": ["Christopher Brito"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/16/ad071dc3-9d07-479b-976a-8e972c223131/thumbnail/1200x630g2/8160474bddd42ebab17fc111944f47a8/screen-shot-2019-09-16-at-10-54-07-am.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
