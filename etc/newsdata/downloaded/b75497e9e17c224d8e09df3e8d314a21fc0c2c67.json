All the different things, who's had a week on, who's had a week off, who's been resting, who hasn't, it all comes down to kick-off.\"\n\nCheika said it was useful for his team to be tested and made to work against Georgia ahead of the knockout round.\n\nREAD | World Rugby slams 'disappointing' Scotland over legal threat\n\n\"The hit-out was good, having to dig in, work hard, get up off the ground, get into some tough stuff,\" he said.\n\n\"It's how we wanted the game to go, we wanted to work like that.\"\n\nHe added: \"Our forwards stepped right up to it. We handled the Georgian scrum well, we scored a maul try... and the line-out worked.\n\n\"It was a good hit-out for the forwards, they got a good shift in. They're getting the bit between their teeth.\"\n\nCheika admitted his team were guilty of several handling mistakes but warned that he expected them to be more accurate next week.\n\n\"We did drop a bit too much ball,\" he said. \"But I thought our carrying was strong, we just didn't have the finishing touch on a lot of stuff so we'll definitely put that on and we'll prepare that and be ready to finish the opportunities that will come next weekend.\"\n\nMilton Haig, in his final game with Georgia after eight years as head coach, said the huge tackle count - almost 80 in the first 20 minutes - had tired his team.\n\n\"We knew it was going take a toll in the second half,\" the Kiwi said.\n\n\"We had some opportunities in the second-half, but we couldn't get our set piece going.\n\n\"I can't fault the boys on how they put themselves about. I was really proud of them tonight, especially in defence.\"\n\nAustralia, Haig added, were \"a very good side\".\n\n\"We played pretty well and if they get a slating (for handling errors), that would be disrespectful to Georgia.\"", "description": "Australia coach Michael Cheika took a pop at England's Eddie Jones as they set their sights on the likely quarter-final against their old foes.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9467/d1f96b5d12c44e8d96ffa77e32eefc12.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
