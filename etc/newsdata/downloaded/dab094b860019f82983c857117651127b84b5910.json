When I\u2019m president, we will implement solutions bold enough to meet the challenges the LGBTQ+ community faces while bringing the American people together to understand that our freedoms are bound up in each other.\u201d\n\nCombined, the proposals amount to the most in-depth LGBT policy outline released by any White House hopeful so far, and draw a sharp contrast with the policies of President Donald Trump, many of which Buttigieg pledges to undo if elected.\n\nTrump, who has fashioned himself since his 2016 presidential campaign as a history-making ally of LGBT people, has largely dealt with LGBT issues in the same manner as previous Republican presidents, including a spur-of-the-moment tweet announcing that \u201ctransgender individuals\u201d would no longer be allowed \u201cto serve in any capacity in the U.S. military,\u201d ending protections for transgender students in public schools, and just this week arguing before the Supreme Court that sex discrimination protections should not be used to prevent discrimination against gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender Americans.\n\nThe president\u2019s most prominent gay allies have dismissed Buttigieg\u2019s past attacks on the administration\u2019s record\u2014as well his hits against Vice President Mike Pence, a fellow Hoosier who signed a bill that provided legal cover for anti-LGBT discrimination\u2014as \u201copportunism\u201d afforded by his status as a gay candidate.\n\n\u201cWhen it benefited his political career, Pete Buttigieg remained in the closet. When it benefited his political career, Pete Buttigieg came out as gay,\u201d former Log Cabin Republicans president Gregory T. Angelo told The Daily Beast in April. \u201cWhen it benefited his political career, Buttigieg was more than happy to stand shoulder to shoulder with Mike Pence as allies, and when it benefited his political career, Pete Buttigieg was more than happy to throw his longtime friendship with Mike Pence under the bus and criticize him.\u201d\n\nButtigieg, who has in the past said that he doesn\u2019t want to be constrained by the label of \u201cthe Gay Candidate,\u201d is far from the only Democratic presidential candidate to have called for an end to Trump-era LGBT policies.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden, whose public call for same-sex marriage helped force President Barack Obama come out publicly in support of marriage equality, has publicly stated that his top legislative priority would be the passage of the Equality Act, which would protect LGBT people from legal discrimination. In a video message recorded for attendees of RuPaul\u2019s DragCon, Sen. Elizabeth Warren specifically cited ongoing violence against trans women of color as a crisis that the next president must address. Warren released her policy plan for LGBT issues on Thursday morning as well.", "description": "Scott Olson/GettyAs the first out presidential candidate in the history of the Democratic Party, Pete Buttigieg has largely won over members of the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender political establishment who see his upper-tier candidacy\u2014and top-tier fundraising numbers\u2014as a promising sign of mainstream", "authors": ["Scott Bixby"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GPDrycSlUWcO.6DVDstIDA--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/bf626098ee91d947213dcf3e4da17f5b", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
