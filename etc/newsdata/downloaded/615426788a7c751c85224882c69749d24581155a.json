(Submitted by Lenore Newman)\n\nThe cautionary tale of the passenger pigeon\n\nThe passenger pigeon is one of the more recent examples of humans obliterating a species they loved. Martha, the last passenger pigeon on Earth, died in 1914 at the Cincinnati Zoo.\n\nThe species's demise had been swift. The passenger pigeon was once the most abundant bird in North America, and possibly the world.\n\nWhen European settlers first colonized North America, Newman said, there were so many passenger pigeons that the sky would darken when they flew across.\n\nThey were an important food to the Haudenosaunee and other Indigenous communities around the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River, and they soon became important to settlers. The iconic Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois meat pie tourti\u00e8re was originally baked with passenger pigeons \u2014 the name comes from the French word for passenger pigeon, tourte \u2014 and the chef would sometimes leave the feet poking out of the crust of the pie, Newman said.\n\nBut soon, telegraphs helped hunters quickly get word of where the flocks were roosting, and railways made it easier for them to travel there, Newman said. Bigger marketplaces made it more convenient to sell the dead birds off in larger quantities.\n\nAnd then, suddenly, it was gone.\n\nA statue of Martha, the last passenger pigeon, at the Cincinnati Zoo in 2013.

(Al Behrman/Associated Press)\n\n\"It is the most striking extinction, in some ways, because it happened so quickly, from plentiful to zero,\" Newman said.\n\nShe said that part of why humans have been eating foods to extinction for millennia is that we're just too efficient at getting dinner.\n\n\"Our technologies just totally overwhelm the ability of the natural world to maintain species numbers,\" she said.\n\nShe added that humans have evolved to be much better at responding to short-term than long-term problems.\n\n\"If someone throws a baseball at you, you've probably got a good chance of catching it \u2014 we're very good at that kind of thing,\" she said. But, \"if climate change starts to impact your ecosystem, we're not so good at that.\"\n\nShe said the fate of the passenger pigeon is also a cautionary tale for fishing today.\n\n\"Fish are very similar to passenger pigeons in behaviour \u2014 they flock,\" she said. \"We may want to consider not fishing in the wild at all.\"\n\nFruits and vegetables also in danger\n\nIt's not just our favourite meats and fish that are at risk, Newman said.\n\nMany fruits and vegetables could also be vulnerable to extinction because so few subspecies of them are being grown now.\n\n\"I may have had thousands of varieties of apples to pick from at one time, and now [we've] lost 80 to 90 per cent of them,\" Newman said.\n\nLenore Newman says the world has lost 80 to 90 per cent of the subspecies of food crops, including subspecies of apples.

It's still possible to cultivate a far wider variety of fruits and vegetables, and there are many actions that people can take in their own lives.\n\nNewman recommended that anyone with a bit of a yard or balcony plant some bee-friendly plants.\n\n\"We need bees for about a third of our plant crops and they're under constant stress,\" she said.\n\nShe's also encouraged by advances in what's known as cellular agriculture \u2014 products like lab-grown meat , or a new ice cream made from dairy proteins cultivated in a lab, without any cows.\n\n\"You can't tell [the ice creams] apart if you taste them ... it's a little freaky,\" she said.\n\nA professor holds the world's first lab-grown beef burger in London on Aug. 5, 2013.

(David Parry/Reuters)\n\nAdopting more of those technologies and using less land for farming would allow more land to be converted back into wilderness, Newman said, and give more species a fighting chance at survival.\n\n\"I will admit I remain pretty hopeful,\" she said.\n\nWritten by Allie Jaynes.
