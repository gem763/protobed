On the other hand, uncertainty over Sino-U.S. trade tussle looks still creating bearishness in global equity markets.\n\nFinally, I conclude that the currently prevailing exhaustion in seems evident enough for a steep downward move before the weekly closing. I find that a downward move below 2941 will confirm the continuity of a downward trend in S&P 500.
