However, TMO Marius Jonker ruled that Curry was not a viable passing option as he was in front and blocked Sam Whitelock, so the try was ruled out.\n\nReferee Nigel Owens had to explain multiple situations to England's Owen Farrell in the game\n\nA second try was ruled out shortly after half-time. Ben Youngs thought he had put England further ahead with a brilliant score, only for play to be brought back once again by Jonker.\n\nAfter Youngs had looked to sneak in the try off the back of the maul, the replay showed that the ball went forward in a controversial call by the TMO.\n\n'Retallick scooped that no forward pass,' said former England player Austin Healey, claiming the ball was passed to a New Zealand hand rather than an England hand during the maul.\n\nMeanwhile, the likes of Harry Maguire and Stuard Broad tweeted their support for their country.\n\n'Come on England,' was the Manchester United defender's simple message to the squad.\n\nCricket World Cup winner Stuart said: 'I was born in Nottingham, England. My sister Gemma was born in Takapuna, New Zealand. This is a big one, come on England!'", "description": "Eddie Jones's England were the best side for much of their Rugby World Cup semi-final match against New Zealand on Saturday, and would've scored more if it weren't for the TMO.", "authors": ["Matt Porter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/11/20213234-0-image-a-9_1572085720725.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
