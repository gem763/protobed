Larry McCormack, lmccormack@tennessean.com\n\nAt 95, Carter is still building homes and taking on humanitarian projects. He and Bernie Sanders are role models for serving no matter your age.\n\nI could not help but be moved by recent photos circulating out of Nashville, Tennessee, showing Jimmy Carter, looking as though he had been punched in the eye, patiently fashioning a piece of wood and preparing to use a power drill \u2014 lending his energies to a building project for one more person in need.\n\nYes, that Jimmy Carter, former president, the man for whom I cast my first ballot. The man, 95, who just became the nation\u2019s oldest former president.\n\nThe man in whom, apparently, there is no quit.\n\nIn the photos, Carter wears a red bandanna, a baseball cap, a large bandage over his left eye, and a large bruise beneath it and across his cheek, along with 14 stitches courtesy of a fall he had taken a couple of days earlier at his home in Plains, Georgia.\n\nA former president driven to do good\n\nCarter, whose humanitarian streak knows no end, is an inspiration. He has been building homes with the nonprofit Habitat for Humanity for decades, not to mention taking on scores of humanitarian projects both at home and abroad.\n\nHe seems, as one old friend used to describe such folks, driven to do good.\n\n\"I fell down and hit my forehead on a sharp edge and had to go to the hospital,\u201d Carter told a crowd on Oct. 6 at Nashville's fabled Ryman Auditorium. \u201cAnd they took 14 stitches in my forehead and my eye is black, as you\u2019ve noticed. But I had a No. 1 priority and that was to come to Nashville and build houses.\u201d\n\nFormer President Jimmy Carter at a Habitat for Humanity project on Oct. 7, 2019, in Nashville, Tennessee. (Photo: Mark Humphrey/AP)\n\nIndeed, Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, 92, were part of a team building new porches on 21 Nashville homes. The project was part of what was called the 36th Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter Work Project with Habitat for Humanity.\n\nCarter, as president, was not our greatest. His critics cast him as weak and ineffective. Maybe he was. People still blame him for the so-called Iranian hostage crisis without delving too deeply into our problematic relations with Iran that continue today.\n\nCarter stood on principle on Olympics\n\nHe is also looked on with disdain for disallowing American athletes to participate in the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. Carter called for the boycott to protest the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. In other words, he did something you rarely see today. He took a stand on principle, not politics.\n\nFormer President Jimmy Carter at work on Oct. 7, 2019, in Nashville, Tennessee.

And yet for all that, he is considered a failure in some circles. He lost to Ronald Reagan, the Gipper, who was Hollywood handsome and had a way with words and who was also going to \"make America great again.\u201d\n\nYet we are right to celebrate Carter\u2019s endurance even as it comes around in these same days that some are questioning the health of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who suffered a heart attack on Oct. 1, and encouraging him to drop out of the presidential race.\n\nSanders returns: Age, health and impeachment: What to watch for in the debate\n\nSanders, 78, directly addressed the event that put him in a Las Vegas hospital, where he underwent a 45-minute procedure to have two stents inserted to address a blockage in an artery.\n\nSanders' campaign decision his own\n\n\u201cI was at an event and \u2026 for the first time in my life I said, get me a chair, I have to sit down. And I was sweating profusely,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI said to my staff, \u2018Guys, we\u2019ve got to get out of here.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn an interview with CNN\u2019s Sanjay Gupta in at his home in Burlington, Vermont, on Oct. 10, Sanders indicated he would be continuing with the campaign, adding that \u201cat the appropriate time, we'll make all the medical records public for you or anyone else who wants to see them.\u201d\n\nDon't ignore age: You don't have to be 37 like Pete Buttigieg, but age should matter in the 2020 campaign\n\nI don\u2019t know whether Sanders should drop out of the race. It strikes me as the most personal of decisions. He alone knows how he feels. What I would say about Sanders, though, is that he seems genuine, a politician to be sure, but one who, like Carter, is driven to do good.\n\nIn the end, I think that as you get older you gain appreciation for your elders, those who came before, who have been where you are now walking, and somehow survived into greater maturity. Both Carter and Sanders are teaching us lessons about the journey, and maybe we can take some of them along as we make our own way.\n\nBruce Lowry is the editorial page editor for The Record and NorthJersey.com, where this column first appeared.
