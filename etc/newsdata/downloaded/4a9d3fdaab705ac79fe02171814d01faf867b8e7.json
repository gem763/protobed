It was captioned: \u201cLook at the mess today\u2019s climate protesters left behind in beautiful Hyde Park.\u201d\n\nHowever, the photo is not from a climate strike, not from Friday and was not taken in Australia. It is from a marijuana-based festival called 420 held in London in April 2019.\n\nIn Sydney, there was no climate strike held in Hyde Park on Friday. Nor was there in London, where the event was held outside the Houses of Parliament.\n\nMatt Burke (@matttburke) Viral misinformation doing rounds. This pic is from an event in Hyde Park, London in April unrelated to climate protests. https://t.co/Ro1fcFLcyS pic.twitter.com/G5aaKLiDzd\n\nLondon\u2019s Royal Parks authority had already addressed the hoax back in April.\n\nRoyal Parks (@theroyalparks) There's a lot of incorrect information doing the Twitter rounds this morning. This photo is the result of an unofficial event in Hyde Park on Saturday, not the #ExtinctionRebellion protestors in Marble Arch.\n\n\n\nIt costs us millions to clear #litter every year. Please take it home. pic.twitter.com/F1JtAqmnVO\n\nAccording to the fact-checking site Snopes, the London marijuana event was held next to an Extinction Rebellion protest. The photo does show London\u2019s Hyde Park but the rubbish was created by the 420 attendees, not climate protesters.\n\nAccording to organisers, Extinction Rebellion protesters helped clean up the mess made at the 420 event.\n\nSnopes says the confusion began due to ambiguous wording from a Facebook page THTC (The Hemp Trading Company) that was trying to shame 420 attendees to clean up.\n\n\u201cThis is #HydePark after #420,\u201d it said. \u201cAshamed is not the word. With #extinctionrebellion not yards away, so many of you couldn\u2019t be bothered to clean up after yourselves\u2026#cannabiscommunity you can do better \u2013 you need to do better.\n\nAfter the misinformation began to spread, the THTC page clarified later, posting: \u201cIMPORTANT EDIT: a lot of people are misreading this post. This was the aftermath of Hyde Park 420 \u2013 and was *cleaned up* by Extinction Rebellion crew.\u201d\n\nExtinction Rebellion \u231b\ufe0f (@ExtinctionR) This is from a totally separate event that took place in Hyde park. #ExtinctionRebellion activists went to help tidy up anyway because it grossed us out as much as it does you.\n\nIn the UK on Friday, more than 300,000 people attended more than 200 events, making it the biggest environmental protest the UK had seen.\n\nAn estimated 300,000 people also turned out in Australia, with at least 100,000 in Melbourne and 80,000 in The Domain in Sydney \u2013 not Hyde Park.", "description": "The image was not taken after a climate strike and was not even taken in Australia", "authors": ["Naaman Zhou"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9e478fe328e62f581d86b20de8d9dab29f2d86f/0_95_1283_770/master/1283.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d75f02e7e7850789894e7f34d98580a2", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
