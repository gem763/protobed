Sneak Peek: \"Queen & Slim\"' at Vanity Fair's 6th Annual New Establishment Summit at Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts on October 22, 2019 in Beverly Hills, California. (Photo by Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for Vanity Fair)\n\nA white police officer shoots at a young black woman, then her love interest kills the cop in self-defense.\n\nThe upcoming romantic thriller \u201cQueen and Slim\u201d depicts a black couple on the run after taking justice into their own hands.\n\nIn the trailer, Uncle Earl says, \u201cIsn\u2019t it the black Bonnie and Clyde?\u201d addressing the trope that comes to mind. The multi-talented Lena Waithe wrote the film and delivers a controversial perspective, which she says is precisely the point.\n\n\"I hope the president tweets about [the movie]. You\u2019re not doing your job if this particular president isn\u2019t upset with you,\" Waithe said at Vanity Fair\u2019s New Establishment Summit on Tuesday.\n\nWaithe, who created \u201cThe Chi\u201d on Showtime, is best known for her role as Denise, Aziz Ansari\u2019s best friend, in Netflix\u2019s \u201cMaster of None.\u201d She also wrote the show\u2019s eighth episode in the second season, \u201cThanksgiving,\u201d in which her character comes out as a lesbian over 30 years, much of it reflecting her own life. The episode won an Emmy for outstanding writing for a comedy series, making Waithe the first black woman to win the award.\n\nWaithe felt an urgency to write a movie about police brutality facing black Americans every day. Many still feel like second-class citizens, she added. \u201cIt\u2019s open season on black bodies.\u201d\n\n\u2018Victors, not victims\u2019\n\nStill, instead of taking a tone of sadness and despondency, Waithe wanted to empower the characters. Slim is portrayed by Daniel Kaluuya, who starred in the thriller \u201cGet Out,\u201d and breakout star Jodie Turner-Smith plays the role of Queen.\n\n\u201cI wanted to portray black people as victors, not victims,\u201d said Melina Matsoukas, the Grammy Award-winning director behind iconic music videos like Beyonce\u2019s \u201cFormation\u201d and Rihanna and Calvin Harris\u2019s \u201cWe Found Love.\u201d She also directed the \u201cThanksgiving\u201d episode.\n\nWaithe had a few non-negotiables for the film: Matsoukas had to direct it, they had to shoot and release it within the same year, and she would not take any notes from an executive that \u201cdoesn\u2019t look like us.\u201d\n\n49th NAACP Image Awards \u2013 Show \u2013 Pasadena, California, U.S., 15/01/2018 \u2013 Daniel Kaluuya wins the Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture award for \"Get Out.\" REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni More\n\n\u201cMy script is something that I knew was undeniable. Black audiences have said to us, \u2018This hits different. This feels different\u2019 [during screenings]. We\u2019re not catering to a white audience. There is no form of the white gaze at all. This is our version of what we feel like when we\u2019re watching white films... we have to sit through those films all the time,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen asked whether such a laser sharp (if not narrow) point of view will deliver on a national level, Waithe said, \u201cBlack folks are going to show up but everyone else will too. Because they\u2019ll ask, \u2018What\u2019s all that fuss about?\u2019 We\u2019re rebels, we\u2019re artists. And they\u2019ll have no choice but to step back and take notice.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s indisputable that the black gaze is getting more commercial recognition and success. \u201cBlack Panther\u201d (DIS) crossed the $1 billion mark at the box office in just 26 days, and \u201cGet Out\u201d became the highest grossing movie for a feature debut of an original screenplay in 2017. Black directors made 16 of the top 100 films of 2018, backing Waithe\u2019s thesis.\n\nAfter speaking with Fox Searchlight, Lionsgate, and A24, among others, \u201cQueen and Slim\u201d ultimately decided to partner with Universal Pictures to distribute the film, which had a budget of approximately $20 million. The movie will be released nationwide on November 27, Thanksgiving Day.\n\nShe said she\u2019s been deeply inspired by black photojournalist Gordon Parks, who is known for documenting civil rights movements from the 1940s through the 1970s. \u201cI want to be a writer version of him. I want to capture what it\u2019s like to be black.\u201d\n\nMelody Hahm is a senior correspondent at Yahoo Finance, covering entrepreneurship, technology and culture.
