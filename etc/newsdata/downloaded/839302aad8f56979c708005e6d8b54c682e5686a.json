They are more educated than earlier generations. And in their leisure time, they\u2019re more likely to socialize, such as through games, than their older peers.\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s according to a new study from economist Michelle Freeman at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Freeman explored how millennials fill their days, and how their choices compare with earlier generations. The study draws on 2017 data from the American Time Use Survey, which produces estimates on how Americans spend their time on an average day. In 2017, millennials were ages 21 to 36, and the nonmillennials were 37 and older.\n\nThese habits are of keen interest to researchers, given millennials\u2019 outsized ability \u2014 rivaling baby boomers \u2014 to recast societal and cultural trend lines. In fact, their economic circumstances and daily habits have often led them to be blamed for \u201ckilling\u201d everything, from casual restaurant chains credit cards to the car industry.\n\nAD\n\nMillennials are significantly worse off financially than prior generations, research shows. The net worth of Americans in the 18 to 35 bracket has dropped 34 percent since 1996, according to a May study from Deloitte. Their average net worth was less than $8,000, the Deloitte study found.\n\nAD\n\nMoreover, costs for education have climbed 65 percent in the past decade, and the price of food has risen 26 percent. Add on housing, health care and transportation expenses, and millennials\u2019 behaviors are often less a reflection of their preferences than the result of being strapped for cash.\n\nFirst, some demographic data: millennials were more likely than older generations to be Hispanic or Latino, Freeman found. Millennials were more evenly split between men and women than their older peers, who were slightly more likely to be female. The cohort was also more likely to be employed and to work full time than nonmillennials.\n\nAD\n\nFreeman told The Post that she was personally surprised by just how much more education millennials had under their belts; 45.3 percent of them had a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher, compared with 35.2 percent of the older age group.\n\nAD\n\nSo what do millennials do all day?\n\nThey spent more time working, providing child care and taking part in educational activities than their older peers. But they spent less time than nonmillennials on household chores, civic or religious work and leisure activities. That\u2019s largely due to the fact that, compared with older generations, millennials were more likely to be working, taking care of young children or still be enrolled in school, Freeman found.\n\nAD\n\nBut they do sleep more. On average, millennials got nine hours of shut-eye each day, compared with 8.6 hours recorded by their older peers.\n\nMillennials spent half as much time each day relaxing and thinking than older generations. Participation rates in sports, exercise and recreational activities were close, with millennials eking out an extra four minutes a day on these pursuits than nonmillennials. Both groups spent the largest share of their free time watching television. But on any given day, millennials were still less likely to watch TV, and when they did, they spent less time doing so.\n\nBut there is an upside: Millennials were nearly twice as likely as nonmillennials to play games \u2014 from Scrabble to computer games to crossword puzzles \u2014 on a typical day, and to spend longer doing so. Older generations, meanwhile, spent more time reading for fun.\n\nAD", "description": "Millennials are more educated than earlier generations.
