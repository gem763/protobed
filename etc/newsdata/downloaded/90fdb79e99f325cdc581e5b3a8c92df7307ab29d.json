The workers\u2014mostly women of Somali descent\u2014demanded increased wages on the night shift, weight restrictions on boxes, and the reversal of a 30-hour weekly workload cap from their managers.\n\nThe strike arrives during a period of increased worker activism at Amazon among both white and blue collar workers. On September 30, workers at an Amazon delivery center in Sacramento formed a group called Amazonians United Sacramento to protest the firing of an employee who went an hour over on her bereavement leave after her mother-in-law died. Two weeks ago, more than 1,000 Amazon employees staged the first white collar walkout in the company\u2019s history.\n\nStriking workers at the Eagan plant also demanded an increase in their hourly wage, which currently sits at $16.25 an hour. They argue they should get paid more on the night shift.\n\nThe two-and-a-half hour strike in Eagan ended when an Amazon manager committed to resolving the issues in the morning, and all truck deliveries were cancelled for the night. The workers say they \u201cremain prepared to take action if no changes are made.\u201d\n\nThis is the second strike at the Eagan plant in the last two months. In August, 80 employees walked out of the plant to protest parking conditions. Within two hours, management had agreed to expand off-site parking, repay workers for towed cars, and allow workers to clock-in off site so they aren\u2019t marked late.\n\n\u201cThe workers are very excited because they got something they wanted and because they spoke up. The managers say they will do something, but they didn\u2019t say exactly what,\u201d Kadijo Mohamed, one of the walkout\u2019s organizers, told Motherboard. \u201cThe managers were very angry, and afraid of what the workers did when they stopped stocking,\u201d she continued.\n\nFed up with their managers, Mohamed told Motherboard the workers had decided to strike because it was the best way to get their attention. \u201cThe managers don\u2019t listen. They ignore complaints. Sometimes they say \u2018if you can\u2019t handle this job, you can quit,\u2019\u201d Mohamed said.\n\nMost Amazon workers at delivery centers\u2014smaller warehouses for sorting packages before delivery\u2014do not receive health care benefits and can be fired for taking more time off than 20 hours every quarter. At the Amazon delivery center in Eagan, boxes can weigh up to 70 pounds and breaks on the nine-hour or longer night shift last 15 minutes, according to workers at the warehouse.\n\nAmazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "description": "They are asking for better pay on the night shift and better working conditions.
