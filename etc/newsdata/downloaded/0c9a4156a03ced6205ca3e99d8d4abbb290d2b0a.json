You have to learn from your experiences, your good and your bad, and that\u2019s what we did at Manchester United .\u201d", "description": "Ince says Champions League triumph has given Liverpool belief to dominate - just like Fergie's early trophy wins did for United", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Getty Images", "Sunday Mirror", "Afp Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20645381.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Manchester-United-v-Liverpool-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
