The photographer reportedly warned the men of what was lurking nearby, but only after seeing the scene unfold through his lens.\n\n\u201cBelieve it or not, the fishermen were thinking about nothing but their fishing,\" Hawthorne said of the encounter, according to The Sun. \"They were oblivious to the bear behind them.\u201d\n\nHawthorne, originally from Montana, has been photographing brown bears for several years, but only trekked to Alaska this past May to take a job as a photography guide, according to Explore Big Sky,\n\n\u201cAlaska is truly special,\u201d Hawthorne told the outlet. \u201cNowhere else on this planet can you experience the magnificent brown bear as you can there.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nAnd this experience at Katmai National Park, specifically, is likely one of the craziest encounters Hawthorne has ever captured.\n\n\u201cI believe this photo strikes a nerve for a lot of people,\" he said, per The Sun. \"Many people shiver and recoil when they see it, imagining themselves in the fishermen's shoes.\u201d\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nHawthorne confirmed that both fishermen escaped without any injury, though they were a little shaken.\n\n\u201c[People] then they immediately ask, 'What happened next? Are they alive?'\" he said, \"People can't imagine being that close to a bear and not being attacked, and I don't blame them. The bear truly was not interested in the fishermen, although he may have been interested to see if they had caught a fish for stealing.\u201d\n\nThe photographer credited the story's thankfully uneventful end to the fact that he didn\u2019t see any bear cubs in the area. He also claimed that the two fishermen apparently only suffered \u201ca good startle,\u201d but once they realized there was no danger, they went right back to fishing.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nKatmai National Park is home to thousands of brown bears, some of which can grow to between 600 and 900 pounds, according to the National Park Service.
