Terms of the settlement were confidential but from outward appearances it appears as though Ryanair walked away with a win.\n\nGeekWire, which reported on the U.S. portion of the settlement last month, posted a screenshot of Expedia UK offering a Ryanair flight from Dublin to London Southend Airport. But perusing Expedia websites on Tuesday, Skift couldn\u2019t fund any Ryanair flights as standalone offerings or in packages.\n\nIn both the Ireland and U.S. lawsuits, Ryanair alleged that Expedia was engaged in unauthorized screen-scraping to access the airline\u2019s flights and fares. In the U.S., Ryanair argued that this violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act because it amounted to copyright infringement, added costs to travelers, and led them astray with sometimes-inaccurate information. Ryanair sought damages and injunctive relief.\n\nIn the U.S., defendant Expedia countered that the law Ryanair cited does not give standing to foreign-based airlines.\n\nRyanair is engaged in a number of lawsuits across Europe, trying to eliminate screen-scraping travel companies from obtaining the airline\u2019s content without permission.\n\n\u201cRyanair does not allow any such commercial use of its website and objects to the practice of screenscraping also on the basis of certain legal principles, such as database rights and copyright protection, etc.,\u201d the airline said in an annual report on July 30. \u201cRyanair is currently involved in a number of legal proceedings against the proprietors of screenscraper websites in Ireland, Germany, The Netherlands, France, Spain, Italy, Switzerland and the U.S.\u201d\n\nThe two parties settled the Expedia lawsuit in Washington nine days later.\n\nClass Action Lawsuit\n\nIn the same annual financial filing, Ryanair noted that the City of Birmingham, Alabama\u2019s pension funds sued the airline and its CEO in November, alleging that airline executives misled shareholders \u201cregarding employment and financial data, employee negotiation processes, the September 2017 pilot rostering management issue, and the likelihood and financial impact of unionization, which allegedly artificially inflated the market value of Ryanair\u2019s securities.\u201d\n\nThe Birmingham, Alabama lawsuit seeks class action status. In April, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, and in June Ryanair and CEO Michael O\u2019Leary filed a motion to dismiss.\n\nThis Birmingham, Alabama lawsuit is ongoing.\n\nSubscribe to Skift newsletters covering the business of travel, restaurants, and wellness.", "description": "Ryanair and Expedia appear to have made peace \u2014 or at least they've settled lawsuits that the low-cost carrier filed more than two years ago against the online travel agency in Ireland and the United States.
