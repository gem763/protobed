The purported \u201clunar\u201d Bible is just the latest item purchased by the family to come under scrutiny.\n\nSteve Green, museum founder and president of Hobby Lobby, also purchased thousands of Iraqi archaeological artifacts for a reported $1.6 million, but was forced in 2018 to return them to the Iraqi government and Hobby Lobby paid a $3 million fine after authorities said they were stolen from the war-torn country and smuggled into the U.S. Museum officials have said none of those items were ever part of its collection.\n\nAs for the Dead Sea Scrolls that were called into question, the 11 remaining fragments are being tested, with results expected by the end of the year, Cirmo said. Two of the fragments remain on display with signs noting that they are being tested.\n\nThe museum did not announce that it was replacing the lunar Bible - a decision Cirmo defended.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty ridiculous to think that any museum, that every time you switch something out you\u2019re going to announce it on plaques,\u201d Cirmo said. \u201cCollectors make mistakes all the time. \u2026 This is not something that is unique to Steve Green.\u201d\n\nThe item that was previously displayed is now in storage, Cirmo said.\n\nTulsa author Carol Mersch, who had raised concerns about its authenticity, donated the replacement Bible.\n\n\u201c(Green) is thankful, as is the museum, that someone came forward and donated one that actually went to the moon \u2026 and that one didn\u2019t cost anything,\u201d Cirmo said.\n\nMersch was given 10 lunar Bibles by then-NASA chaplain the Rev. John Stout, a co-founder of the Apollo Prayer League.\n\nGreen, chairman of the museum\u2019s board, bought the original Bible for about $56,000. It had also been displayed at the Vatican.\n\nMersch questioned its authenticity because it had a serial number that was only three digits; she said Stout engraved the authentic lunar Bibles with five-digit numbers. Mersch said the Bible she provided was authenticated by both Stout and Mitchell.\n\n\u201cI thought (donation) the best thing I could do to honor Rev. Stout. He had asked me to donate them to museums,\u201d Mersch said.\n\nGreen bought the item that was originally on display from Georgia-based Peachstate Historical Consulting, which acquired the Bibles from Stout\u2019s brother, James Stout. The Stout brothers are both dead, as is Mitchell. Peachstate owner David Frohman did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press a month before the museum\u2019s 2017 opening, Green acknowledged the museum had made some mistakes early on.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of complexities in areas that I\u2019m still a novice at,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we are engaging the best experts we can to advise and help us in that process.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Museum of the Bible in Washington quietly replaced an artifact purported to be one of a handful of miniature Bibles that a NASA astronaut carried to the moon in 1971 after an expert questioned its authenticity.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ken Miller"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/05/bible_museum_lunar_bible_replaced_62695_c0-308-958-866_s1770x1032.jpg?3b945acfb93e09a997aa69abe2a78c15825699ae", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
