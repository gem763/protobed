Up to ten players can play in a single game as they surf, slide, grind and glide across the cities and subways. Like most (if not all) racing games, the aim is to beat all your competitors to the finish.\n\nImage: Supplied\n\nThere are 14 Subway Surfer characters to choose from, which can be unlocked by collecting coins via big air jumps, perfect landings, rail grinds and finishing in top positions. The app marks one of the first exclusive titles commissioned by Snap Inc., Snapchat's parent company, for its gaming platform.\n\nThe original Subway Surfers was released in May 2012 and slowly picked up fans along the way. In 2017, it was the most downloaded mobile game in the world and has received more than 2.5 billion downloads to date.\n\nThe game is rolling out to Snapchat users worldwide now.", "description": "Mobile game Subway Surfers Airtime is being released around the world today but it's exclusive to Snapchat users.", "authors": ["Alex Walker", "Nathan Grayson"], "top_image": "https://edge.alluremedia.com.au/m/k/2019/10/subwaysurfer.jpg"}
