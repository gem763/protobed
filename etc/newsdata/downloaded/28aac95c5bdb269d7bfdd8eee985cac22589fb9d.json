REUTERS/Leah Millis\n\nThe lawmakers were echoing objections made by White House Counsel Pat Cipollone in an Oct. 8 letter to top House Democrats that said Trump\u2019s lawyers must be allowed to call and cross-examine witnesses, access evidence, and be afforded other \u201cbasic rights guaranteed to all Americans.\u201d\n\nThe following examines the procedures followed in past impeachment investigations and explains why, contrary to Republican claims, the current inquiry does not violate Trump\u2019s constitutional rights.\n\nWHAT PROTECTIONS HAVE DEMOCRATS ALLOWED TRUMP SO FAR?\n\nMembers of three Democratic-led House committees have been interviewing government officials behind closed doors to try to build a case that Trump abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate a rival - Democrat Joe Biden - for his personal political benefit.\n\nWhile Democrats have led these interviews, Republicans who sit on the committees are also able to review documents and ask questions of the witnesses. Trump\u2019s lawyers have been excluded.\n\nDemocrats have said they will hold public hearings soon in order to make their case against Trump to voters. House leaders have likened their investigation to a grand jury proceeding, a preliminary stage of a criminal case conducted in secret.\n\nWHAT DOES TRUMP WANT?\n\nCipollone said the House has \u201cnot established any procedures affording the President even the most basic protections demanded by due process under the Constitution and by fundamental fairness\u201d in violation of \u201cevery past precedent.\u201d\n\nIn addition to granting Trump the right to access evidence, examine witnesses, and have counsel present at hearings, the committees must also disclose evidence that is favourable to him, he wrote.\n\nCipollone argued that Republican lawmakers should be allowed to issue subpoenas, which would enable them to present their own evidence and try to undermine the Democrats\u2019 version of events.\n\nThe White House also said the investigation was not legitimate because the full House had not voted to authorize it.\n\nWHAT HAS HAPPENED IN PAST IMPEACHMENT INQUIRIES?\n\nIn U.S. impeachment proceedings, the House investigates and votes to impeach, and the Senate holds a trial to determine guilt or innocence and whether the president stays in office.\n\nSome of the protections requested by the White House were given to Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon, the two presidents in modern history to face impeachment probes.\n\nThe House allowed Nixon\u2019s defence lawyers to respond to evidence and testimony during his impeachment inquiry. Nixon resigned from office in 1974 before being impeached, however.\n\nTwenty-five years later, Clinton was afforded similar protections. Clinton was impeached by the House but not convicted by the Senate.\n\nIn both of those cases, the House also held a full vote to authorize an impeachment inquiry.\n\nSome scholars have said that Clinton\u2019s case was unique and cannot be likened to the current proceeding, however, because the Republicans who impeached Clinton relied on evidence laid out in a report by former independent counsel Kenneth Starr, who Democrats accused of political bias.\n\nIS THE TRUMP IMPEACHMENT INVESTIGATION UNCONSTITUTIONAL?\n\nAccording to several experts, no.\n\nFrank Bowman, a law professor at the University of Missouri, said the U.S. Constitution gives the House the freedom to set its own ground rules for the process.\n\nNo full vote is needed to authorize an investigation and the House is not obligated to let Trump\u2019s lawyers participate, Bowman said.\n\n\u201cTrump has no standing whatsoever to insist that the House do impeachment the way he would like it done,\u201d Bowman said.\n\nBowman added that fairness to Trump is more of a concern if there is a trial in the Senate, which is currently controlled by Republicans. Like the House, the Senate has broad authority to set its own impeachment rules.\n\nBut some legal experts said giving Trump basic protections and allowing his lawyers to participate would make the impeachment investigation appear more fair.\n\nThat could be a wise political move for Democrats, said Ross Garber, who teaches impeachment law at Tulane Law School and has represented four governors in impeachment proceedings.\n\nBypassing due process safeguards that are standard in the U.S. legal system \u201cmay make the American people question the legitimacy of the impeachment process,\u201d Garber said.\n\n(This story has been refiled to remove extraneous word in sub-headline).", "description": "Republican lawmakers on Wednesday stormed a hearing room at the U.S. House of Representatives where a Pentagon official was to testify in the impeachment probe of President Donald Trump, yelling that it was unfair and violated Trump's rights.", "authors": ["Jan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444653180&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N1QO", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
