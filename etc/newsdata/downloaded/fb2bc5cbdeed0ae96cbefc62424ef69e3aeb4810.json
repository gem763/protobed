REUTERS/Daniel Becerril\n\nBut GM shares rose 4.6% in early trading on the back of a better-than-expected quarterly net profit because of robust U.S. sales of high-margin pickup trucks and SUVs. Wall Street analysts have viewed the strike costs as a tradeoff for three U.S. plant closures agreed to with the union that will boost GM\u2019s profitability.\n\n\u201cThe underlying business was strong this quarter,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Dhivya Suryadevara told reporters at GM\u2019s headquarters, describing the strike as a \u201cone-time impact.\u201d\n\nLast Friday, the 48,000 United Auto Workers union members at GM ratified a new four-year labor deal with the Detroit company. The 40-day strike cost GM more than $2 billion according to analysts.\n\nThe Detroit-based automaker reported a 6% increase in third-quarter U.S. sales, led by its highly-profitable full-size pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers that helped it race to a strong profit margin of almost 11% in North America. It\u2019s that underlying business that has investors excited.\n\n\u201cFrankly, I\u2019m as emboldened as ever,\u201d said Chris Susanin, co-portfolio manager at Levin Easterly Partners, which owned more than 4 million GM shares at the end of June. \u201cI don\u2019t see why this stock isn\u2019t north of $100 (a share) in a couple years.\u201d\n\nVirtually all of the pre-tax profits came from its North American business and its captive finance arm.\n\nIn China, where GM reported a 17.5% drop in third-quarter sales, the company\u2019s equity income fell 40% to $300 million.\n\nIt was the fifth straight quarterly sales decline for GM in China, the world\u2019s largest auto market, where the industry is expecting a second consecutive annual sales drop.\n\nThe China Association of Automobile Manufacturers expects a 5% decline for industry sales in 2019, then contracting or growing slowly over the next three years.\n\n\u201cIt (China) remains volatile,\u201d GM CFO Suryadevara said.\n\nLast week, GM\u2019s smaller U.S. rival, Ford Motor Co, cut its forecast for operating profit for the year after a disappointing quarter hurt by higher warranty costs, bigger discounts and weaker-than-expected performance in China.\n\nGM said the strike by the UAW had cost it $1 billion on pre-tax profits in the quarter, or 52 cents per share. CFO Suryadevara said the automaker lost around 300,000 units of vehicle production during the strike.\n\nThe union wrung higher pay and other benefits from GM as part of the deal to end the strike.\n\nUnder the deal, GM will invest $9 billion in the United States, including $7.7 billion directly in its plants, with the rest going to joint ventures.\n\nThe No. 1 U.S. automaker said the full-year impact of the strike would be around $2 per share, or around $3 billion.\n\nGM said it now expected full-year adjusted earnings per share between $4.50 to $4.80, down from its previous forecast of $6.50 to $7 per share.\n\nThe company said it now expected full-year adjusted automotive free cash flow in a range from zero to $1 billion, down from its previous forecast of $4.5 billion to $6 billion. GM\u2019s adjusted automotive free cash flow stood at $2.4 billion at the end of the third quarter.\n\nGM also cut its projected 2019 capital expenditures to around $7.5 billion from its previous outlook of $8 billion to $9 billion.\n\nThe automaker posted third-quarter net income of $2.3 billion, or $1.60 a share, down from $2.5 billion, or $1.75 a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, GM earned $1.72 a share. Analysts had expected $1.31, on average, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nRevenue fell slightly to $35.47 billion from $35.79 billion, above analysts\u2019 estimates of $33.82 billion.", "description": "General Motors Co on Tuesday slashed its earnings forecast for 2019, saying that a 40-day U.S. labor strike by the United Auto Workers union that brought virtually all of its North American operations to a standstill would cost it around $3 billion in profits this year.", "authors": ["Nick Carey", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446166913&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S0VN", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
