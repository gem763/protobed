South Korea said it was responding to Japan\u2019s restrictions on trade with South Korea, including on the export of specialized chemicals needed to make components for electronic devices . Japan described the move as a tightening of controls over critical materials, but it went far beyond that.\n\nThe rupture has little to do with national security, important materials, mismanagement or any of the other proffered rationales. It\u2019s all about age-old animosities, and they\u2019ve been allowed to putrefy in large measure by President Trump\u2019s irresponsible attitude toward trade and alliances.\n\nThis is a fight in which everyone stands to lose except China and North Korea, and the Trump administration should be heavily leaning on its closest Asian allies to come to their senses.\n\nThe roots of the animosity stretch to Japan\u2019s colonization of Korea between 1910 and 1945, and more specifically the brutal exploitation of Koreans as sex slaves and forced laborers during World War II. Passions have flared regularly but have usually been tamped down through the alliance of the two democracies with the United States against threats posed by North Korea and China, and by the extensive trade between South Korea and Japan.", "description": "The United States could help resolve the rift between two critical allies.
