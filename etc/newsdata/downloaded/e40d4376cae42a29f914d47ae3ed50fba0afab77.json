Levie\u2019s quip was attached to a CNBC news article detailing a $1.7 billion payout that Neumann will reportedly receive.\n\nNeumann\u2019s staggering payout is part of a deal organized by Japan\u2019s SoftBank to take over the struggling office-sharing company, which abandoned its IPO plans in September.\n\nThe deal, reported on Tuesday by The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Maureen Farrell and Eliot Brown, stipulates that Neumann will step down from the company\u2019s board. In exchange, SoftBank will buy nearly $1 billion of his WeWork stock, pay him a $185 million \u201cconsulting fee\u201d and offer him a $500 million credit line.\n\nThe payout rattled current and former WeWork employees, who told Business Insider\u2019s Meghan Morris that they were frustrated with the deal. Industry experts, such as corporate law professors, analysts, and tech executives, were also astounded by the move.\n\nI\u2019ve read almost every book on startups, and somehow have just completely missed the chapters that covered this part of the strategy. https://t.co/H41lGA1kLz \u2014 Aaron Levie (@levie) October 22, 2019\n\nNeumann resigned as WeWork\u2019s CEO in September, after reports of his management and financial practices soured investors on the company and scuttled its IPO. Neumann remained on WeWork\u2019s board at the time \u2013 a position he will lose with the latest SoftBank deal.\n\nLevie, whose Twitter bio describes him as Box\u2019s CEO and \u201cLead Magician,\u201d took Box public back in 2015, after a bumpy road that caused the company to delay its offering. The company\u2019s stock surged 66% on its first day of trading, but has since fallen and currently trades just a smidgen above its $14 IPO price.\n\nThe Box CEO recently spoke to TechCrunch about the process of going public, saying that there\u2019s often too much attention focused on the IPO and not the business model.\n\n\u201cI think we have too much of a fixation on the IPO moment versus just building durable business models and how do they end up translating into valuations,\u201d Levie recently said at TechCrunch Disrupt San Francisco.", "description": "Business Insider - Ex-WeWork CEO Adam Neumann will reportedly receive around $1.7 billion as part of a bailout deal, a move the CEO of Box seemingly mocked on Twitter..
