Tapper\u2019s welcome was heartfelt. But had Tapper placed honesty in front of manners, he would have warned Duffy that he just had volunteered for a mission\u2014defending Trumpism on CNN\u2014that\u2019s more perilous than taking the beach at Normandy.\n\nCNN\u2019s paid Trump defenders\u2014more on them in a minute\u2014have a tendency to self-destruct either by word or deed in short order, making a public warning the decent thing to do. Unwarned, Duffy used his CNN position to advance Trump\u2019s spurious position that Ukrainians have possession of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s server, which is \u201cat the heart of the Russia investigation.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut Duffy didn\u2019t actually commit media seppuku until Tuesday when he went on CNN to question the patriotism of Ukrainian-born Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the White House insider who had just wounded Trump with testimony in the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cIt seems very clear that [Vindman] is incredibly concerned about Ukrainian defense. I don\u2019t know that he\u2019s concerned about American policy,\u201d said Duffy, accusing the decorated officer of dual loyalty. \u201cWe all have an affinity to our homeland, where we came from.\u201d\n\nKablooey!!! Immediate pushback came from inside CNN. Anchor John Berman asked if Duffy was saying Vindman wasn\u2019t looking out for America first. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Duffy said. CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin, CNN afternoon anchor Brianna Keilar and CNN editor-at-large Chris Cillizza took more shots at Duffy, accusing him of anti-immigrant bigotry, as did the rest of the media universe.\n\nThere\u2019s an amply documented pattern of Trump\u2019s paid TV surrogates setting themselves on fire or slowly ghosting from CNN\u2019s airwaves. The president\u2019s original Tokyo Rose, Jeffery Lord, was sacked in August 2017 for tweeting the phrase \u201cSieg Heil!\u201d at Media Matter\u2019s front-man Angelo Carusone. After Lord came Ed Martin, a St. Louis talk-show host and Trump loyalist who lost his CNN contract in January 2018 after calling fellow CNN contributors \u201cblack racists\u201d and \u201crabid feminists.\u201d Other short-termers on CNN\u2019s pro-Trump beat include Jason Miller, his former campaign communications director, and Paris Dennard, both of whom left the network in 2018. In early 2019, CNN dumped another pair from its payroll\u2014former officeholders Jack Kingston and Andre Bauer\u2014and later that year parted ways with Trump campaign and transition veteran Bryan Lanza. The Hollywood Reporter noted in August that Steve Cortes and Ben Ferguson, Trump\u2019s latest media spear carriers, had all but disappeared from CNN.\n\nCNN plagues us with its endless series of Trump surrogates because the casting of the news requires proper \u201cvillains\u201d to parry with the \u201cheroes.\u201d Or as CNN President Jeff Zucker put it, \u201cYou can\u2019t run a news channel and you can\u2019t do a show if you don\u2019t talk to all sides.\u201d That sounds like a sensible explanation, but it doesn\u2019t go to the heart of the matter. The network could interview Trump supporters without putting them on the payroll. It just wouldn\u2019t be as dramatic.\n\nWhat makes being Trump media surrogate such a high-attrition job is that that position must be filled by somebody close to the president who is willing to repeat, amplify and explain the racist, insulting, inflammatory and conspiratorial things the president says on a daily basis. The surrogate is hired to channel all of Trump\u2019s awfulness. Once Trump attacked Lt. Col. Vindman on Twitter, Duffy had no real alternative as a paid Trump supporter but to parrot the president. So he went on air and squawked. He did his job.\n\nIf Duffy gets fired (really, I should say, \u201cWhen Duffy gets fired\u201d), it will probably be for seconding something outrageous Trump uttered. Although it\u2019s totally unfair, the network will kill the messenger for delivering the message they paid him to deliver, and then it will hire a new messenger and eventually fire him, too. And so on.\n\nThe surrogates are scapegoats. CNN fires them because it can\u2019t fire the president.\n\n\n\n******\n\nIs anybody on TV more Cronkitesque than Jake Tapper?
