(John Bazemore/AP)\n\nAs the Philadelphia Eagles look to improve to 4-2 Sunday with a win against the Minnesota Vikings, one player with inside information on the opponent has dished on his team\u2019s recipe for success.\n\nLinebacker Zach Brown pulled no punches when discussing former Washington Redskins teammate and current Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins.\n\n\u201cCousins, I think every defense is going to want that guy to throw the ball,\u201d Brown told reporters after Friday\u2019s practice. \u201cFor me, that\u2019s probably the weakest part of their offense is him. Everything else is good. They\u2019ve got a good running game, probably one of the best in the league. They have real good receivers. You just want them to pass the ball. You want Kirk Cousins to get it in his hands.\n\n\u201cI realized when I was in Washington, he was kind of careless with the ball,\u201d Brown said. \u201cBut at the same time, hey, you make the bed you sleep in.\u201d\n\nCousins is known for his high passing yardage totals and propensity to lose the football. He already has seven fumbles in five games this season, and recorded a career-high 13 in 2017, when he was Brown\u2019s teammate in Washington.\n\n\u201cI was at the Redskins with him so I know about him. That\u2019s my viewpoint on him,\u201d Brown said.\n\nThe Vikings have shifted from a pass-heavy offense to a run-oriented attack this season and it has paid off to a degree. The Eagles boast the NFL\u2019s best run defense (63 yards per game), but they allow the sixth most passing yards per game (271.2) so Cousins could be forced to throw more than he has in the early stages of this young season.\n\n\u201cMake [Cousins] frustrated back there,\u201d Brown said. \u201cFirst we have to stop the run, and then make him frustrated back there. Our main concern is stopping the run because if they can run the ball, they\u2019re going to win.\u201d\n\nMinnesota running back Dalvin Cook is second in the NFL in rushing yards (542) and tied for third in rushing touchdowns (5). But the Vikings are 29th in passing yards per game (191).\n\nThe Vikings used a pass-heavy attack last season when wideouts Adam Thielen and Stefon Diggs both eclipsed 1,000 yards. Two-time Pro Bowl tight end Kyle Rudolph was third on the team in 2018 with 634 receiving yards. But Rudolph has just six receptions for 36 yards in five games this year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m focused on whatever my job is, and to this point my job has been blocking \u2014 blocking a lot,\u201d Rudolph said earlier last week, though he insists he actually enjoys blocking.\n\nAny frustration the Vikings may have with the lack of a passing attack came to the surface after their 16-6 loss to the Chicago Bears in Week 4.\n\n[The NFL\u2019s parity and disgruntled stars could combine for a blockbuster trade deadline]\n\n\u201cAt some point, you\u2019re not going to be able to run the ball for 180 yards, even with the best running back in the NFL,\u201d Thielen said. \u201cThat\u2019s when you have to be able to throw the ball. \u2026 You have to be able to hit the deep balls.\u201d\n\nCousins made amends with Thielen shortly after.\n\n\u201cI really want to apologize to [Thielen] because there\u2019s too many opportunities where we could have hit him on Sunday,\u201d Cousins said on KFAN\u2019s \u201cUnder Center.\u201d \u201cPostgame when I talk to the media, I always say, \u2018Hey, until I watch the film, it\u2019s hard for me to really give you a straight answer.\u2019 Well, now it\u2019s Tuesday night. I\u2019ve watched the film and the reality is there were opportunities for [Thielen].\n\nDiggs also fanned the flames of trade talk surrounding him after the Bears game, stating, \u201cI feel like there\u2019s truth to all rumors.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t sit up here and act like everything is okay,\u201d Diggs said of the team\u2019s offense. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously not.\u201d\n\nHe was also reportedly fined more than $200,000 for unexcused absences from meetings and practices the week following the game. Vikings Coach Mike Zimmer was noncommittal as to whether Diggs would play last Sunday against the New York Giants.\n\nDiggs ultimately played and the Vikings beat the Giants, 28-10. The win, in which the team put up 306 yards through the air, seemingly helped change the star receiver\u2019s tune.\n\n\u201cYeah, I want to be in Minnesota,\u201d Diggs said after the game.\n\n\u201cIt was never not good,\u201d Diggs said of his relationship with the team. \u201cOutside people got things a little shaky, but at this point, I\u2019m a team guy. I\u2019m here, and I want to win.\u201d\n\nRead more on the NFL:\n\nChristian McCaffrey is doing the impossible: Building an NFL MVP case as a running back\n\nRob Gronkowski drops comeback hint during debut as Fox Sports analyst\n\nWith a great defense and an average offense, the Patriots are undefeated.
