It seemed like Cousins could have had even more if he wanted. The difference, of course, was the Eagles' offense was able to outscore the Patriots.\n\nThat was not the case Sunday.\n\nYes, the Eagles' defense, particularly the secondary, was that bad as the Eagles (3-3) fell behind 24-3 in the second quarter.\n\nCornerback Sidney Jones returned after missing last week's game with a hamstring injury. It didn't go well as he was beaten twice for touchdowns. So was cornerback Rasul Douglas, who got burned by Diggs for TDs of 56 and 51 yards in the second quarter.\n\nJones gave up a 6-yard TD to Adam Thielen in the first quarter and an 11-yard TD to Diggs in the third.\n\nAnd yet, even with the porous defense and a missed fake field goal attempt in the final seconds of the first half, the Eagles still had a chance to tie the game in the third quarter.\n\nTrailing 24-17 in the third quarter, the Eagles got the ball back at midfield and drove to the Vikings' 22 and faced a 3rd-and-3. Carson Wentz's pass in the flat to Alshon Jeffery lost a yard and the Eagles settled for a field goal.\n\nThe Vikings, after a brief lull, got their offense back in gear and scored touchdowns on consecutive drives to put the game away.\n\nThe defense will have to improve dramatically for the Eagles to have a chance against the Cowboys next Sunday night in Dallas.\n\nThat's because Miles Sanders continues to be the Eagles' most effective receiver on offense with DeSean Jackson missing a fourth straight game. Sanders had a 32-yard TD reception and led the Eagles with 86 yards receiving on only three catches.\n\nWentz, who went 26 for 40 for 306 yards, with 2 TDs and an interception, tried two deep passes to Nelson Agholor during the game, but both were incomplete.\n\nIt was the fifth time in six games that the Eagles trailed by 10 or more points. This one, however, was worse than the others as the Eagles fell behind 24-3 early in the second quarter as the combination of quarterback Cousins to Diggs carved up the defense.\n\nDiggs had 135 yards receiving and 2 TDs on four receptions in the first half alone. Cousins was 12 of 17 for 209 yards and 3 TDs.\n\nThe Vikings had little trouble moving the ball against the Eagles right from the start. They controlled the ball for 7 minutes, 17 seconds to open the game, and scored on Cousins' 6-yard TD pass to Thielen over Jones.\n\nIt only got worse from there as the offense went 3-and-out, running the ball three straight times. Then the Vikings again moved down the field with ease. The Eagles, however, dodged a bullet when Thielen missed getting his second foot in the end zone by a few inches, forcing the Vikings to settle for a field goal.\n\nBut the Vikings were only getting started.\n\nThe Eagles answered with a field goal before Cousins started going deep to Diggs. The first was for a 56-yard TD. Then after the Eagles missed on a 4th-and-2 from midfield, the two connected for a 51-yard TD.\n\nBoth times Diggs got well behind Douglas, who had no safety help.\n\nThat gave the Vikings a 24-3 lead with 9:31 left in the second quarter.\n\nThe Eagles tried keeping up as they responded with their best drive of the first half, capped off by Wentz's 32-yard TD to Sanders.\n\nThey had a great chance to get even closer when former Viking Andrew Sendejo intercepted Cousins at midfield with 1:02 left after Diggs couldn't hold onto a sideline pass, deflecting the ball into the air.\n\nBut the Eagles couldn't convert as Elliott's fake on a field goal went haywire.\n\nIt was a fitting metaphor for the Eagles' day.\n\nFake FG misfire\n\nThe Eagles ran a fake field goal with 20 seconds left in the first half. Elliott took the direct snap and started looking for a receiver. When no one was open, he started rolling to his left before throwing a short pass to Dallas Goedert, who was well covered.\n\nThe ball fell incomplete and the Eagles didn't get any points just before halftime.\n\nIt was Elliott's first pass attempt in the NFL.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
