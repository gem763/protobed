But with a robot vacuum can do you dirty work for you and keep things nice and tidy before deeper cleans. Plus, you don't have to spend too much on one.\n\nRight now, you can get the Ecovacs Deebot N79S at Woot! for the lowest price we've ever seen for today only. This smart robot vacuum typically goes for $200, but you can get it for $70 off, which is the best discount we've ever seen and I was honestly shocked upon finding it. It's the perfect price to help lessen the headache of constantly doing chores during the busy school year.\n\nThe N79S is also one of the best smart robot vacuums we've ever tested. We found that it had a pretty good cleaning power and was easy to set up. Its best function, though, is its smart capabilities. Not only can you can control it from an easy-to-use app on your phone, but you can also use Alexa connectivity to take your laziness to the next level by simply saying, \"Alexa, tell Deebot to clean.\" Basically, you'll never have to lift a finger again to get clean floors.\n\nReminder: This sale is only good for today, October 7, so you have very limited time to get an affordable cleaning assistant.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.
