The European Commission said work would \u201ccontinue in the coming days,\u201d according to the BBC.\n\nThe question of whether the deadline will be extended beyond Oct. 31 is important because, if the deadline is not extended, the agreement reached between British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the EU will not be implemented, and the U.K. will leave the union in a so-called hard exit.\n\nThe British pound GBPUSD, -0.2023% traded at $1.2817, down from $1.2851 on Thursday \u2014 a small decline suggesting traders aren\u2019t assigning a high probability to a hasty departure.\n\nBut a short extension could essentially force the U.K.\u2019s Parliament to reconsider the Johnson-negotiated deal.\n\nU.K. stocks were weaker, with the FTSE 100 UKX, -0.05% falling 0.57% to 7,286.79.\n\nOne outlier was WPP WPP, +6.10% , which surged nearly 7% as the advertising-agency group reported 0.7% comparable revenue less pass-through costs in the third quarter. \u201cThe group saw positive quarterly growth in revenue for the first time in over one year, which is a sign the company\u2019s new strategy is paying off. Traditional advertisers like WPP have been losing ground to the likes of Google in recent years, so they have had to change their tactics,\u201d said David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets U.K., in a note to clients.", "description": "The British pound drifted lower on Friday on uncertainty of whether, or how long, the European Union would extend a deadline for the U.K. to depart.", "authors": ["Steve Goldstein", "European Markets Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU025_eu_bre_ZG_20191025094637.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
