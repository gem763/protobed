Mark Meadows (R-NC) argued Tuesday.\n\nRep. Meadows, who witnessed Volker\u2019s testimony, told reporters, \u201cThe full text of Amb. Volker\u2019s testimony last week would\u2019ve exonerated this president, let\u2019s release it.\u201d\n\nOther Republican lawmakers have also called on the Democrats to release the full transcript of Volker\u2019s testimony.\n\nMeadows, joined by Reps. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), Lee Zeldin (R-NY), Matt Gaetz (R-FL), and Scott Perry (R-PA) briefed reporters on Tuesday about U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to block U.S. European Union Amb. Gordon Sondland from testifying before the House panels pursuing the impeachment inquiry. The Republican lawmakers, with the exception of Gaetz, serve in the House committees leading the investigation.\n\nJordan asserted the transcripts prove President Donald Trump did not pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son in exchange for aid.\n\nThe Ohio Republican, who was also present when Volker delivered his testimony, told reporters:\n\nWhy not release the transcripts so you can all see what Amb. Volker told us? There is no wrongdoing [by Trump]. He [Volker] was completely as clear as could be, no quid pro quo whatsoever \u2026 Democrat chairmen after they read the transcript, said no quid pro quo whatsoever, but Adam Schiff doesn\u2019t want that information out there. So, he is holding up the transcripts.\n\nZeldin, who also witnessed Volker\u2019s testimony, maintained that the information the former envoy provided \u201cobliterated\u201d the Democrats\u2019 quid pro quo offer claim.\n\nHe described the impeachment inquiry as a \u201cfairy tale,\u201d adding that the process is akin to a \u201ckangaroo court.\u201d\n\nThe Democrat-led House Committees on Oversight and Reform, Intelligence, and Foreign Affairs pursuing the impeachment inquiry refuse to release the transcript of the more than eight hours of testimony provided by Volker last Thursday.\n\nInstead, Reps. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), Adam Schiff (D-CA), and Eliot Engel (D-NY) have chosen to release bits and pieces of the evidence provided by Volker, namely a series of texts, to fuel their impeachment agenda.\n\nSchiff (Intelligence), Cummings (Oversight and Reform), and Engel (Foreign Affairs) are the chairmen of the House panels conducting the impeachment investigation.\n\nVolker proclaimed in written testimony that the texts were evidence that the Trump administration did not push Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son.\n\nNevertheless, the Democrat leaders cherry-picked and mischaracterized the texts, releasing a \u201csubset\u201d of the communication exchange that favored their impeachment efforts.\n\nAsked why the Trump administration is preventing Sondland from talking to House lawmakers, Congressman Perry said:\n\nTo give the majority enough time \u2014 the maximum amount of time \u2014 to release the [full transcript of Volker\u2019s] testimony that happened last week. So we have that information out there and we know, in good faith, that they, in good faith, are going to release the testimony for the American people to see as opposed to parsing out little pieces that support their narrative.\n\nEchoing his Republican colleagues, Perry indicated that if the Democrats release the transcript, the Trump administration would likely cooperate more with their impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cIf they are willing to do that, then I think the administration will be willing to do more moving forward,\u201d he said, referring to the release of the transcript.\n\nThe GOP congressmen blasted the media\u2019s lack of interest in the full transcript.\n\n\u201cAdam Schiff is misleading you and you\u2019re playing along with it, many of you are, and the American people are then getting deceived,\u201d Zeldin told reporters.\n\nSchiff delivered a statement about Sondland not testifying, but refused to take questions from reporters. In a joint statement, Schiff, Engel, and Cummings described the decision to prevent the ambassador from testifying as an attempt to \u201cto impede and obstruct the impeachment inquiry.\u201d", "description": "Mark Meadows said the full transcript of the Volker testimony would would clear President Donald Trump of any wrongdoing.", "authors": ["Edwin Mora"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/12/Mark-Meadows-Fighting.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
