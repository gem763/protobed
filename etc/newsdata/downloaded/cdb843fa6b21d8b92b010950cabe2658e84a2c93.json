The sale is expected to generate net proceeds of about S$2.3 million, while resulting in a net loss on disposal of about S$3.15 million.\n\nAs at end-June, Hoe Leong's vessel Arkstar Eagle 1 had a net book value of S$2.75 million, while the vessel Arkstar Eagle 3 had a net book value of US$2.7 million. But based on an independent valuation, both vessels have a market value of about US$580,000 each, Hoe Leong said in its filing.\n\nIn addition, the vessels' class licenses have just expired and both are due for drydocking, which would cost about S$620,000 per vessel.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\nHoe Leong is also under financial pressure, having received a statutory demand for S$5.7 million from UOB in late-August. The sale of the vessels is part of the restructuring plan Hoe Leong is discussing with UOB.\n\nArkstar Eagle 1 is mortgaged to Sing Investments & Finance (SIF), while Arkstar Eagle 3 is mortgaged to RHB Bank. As at Tuesday, Hoe Leong owes SIF and RHB S$2.43 million each.\n\nThe proposed sale will require shareholders' approval, unless SGX grants a waiver. It is also contingent on the buyer Allianz Offshore repaying over US$465,000 due to two subsidiaries of Hoe Leong. The deal will also need to be green-lighted by RHB and SIF.\n\nIf the sale is not completed within the next 90 days, Allianz Offshore has the option to terminate the MOA.\n\nShares of Hoe Leong last traded at S$0.002 before they were suspended in September.", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Companies & Markets - MAINBOARD-LISTED Hoe Leong Corporation is proposing to sell two of its vessels for US$850,000 each, or a total of US$1.7 million, to Allianz Offshore Ship Management. .
