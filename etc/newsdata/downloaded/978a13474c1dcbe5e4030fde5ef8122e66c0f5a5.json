They told me that he was very young but scored many goals and he was very good.\n\n'I did not know him and one day I saw him and his father at a Nike store. I saw him, he looked small and shy and I thought: \"Is this one as good as they say?\"\n\n'We started pre-season in Scotland, we won 6-1, 5-0 and he would score three goals a game for you. I thought that, with him, we would win everything.'\n\nWith Messi fast becoming Barcelona's talisman under Guardiola, the club clinched three La Liga titles and two Champions League trophies among a host of other silverware during the Spaniard's 247 games at the helm.\n\nThe current Manchester City boss also admitted he was surprised by Messi's small stature\n\nThe mercurial forward had doubled his goal tally in his second season under the former manager, and currently boasts more than 600 goals for the reigning La Liga champions.\n\nGuardiola also highlighted the special bond he still shares with his trophy-laden group from Spain.\n\nHe added: 'There was not much time to, but I enjoyed the process of building the team; seeing that the changes we made worked and everything was flowing; how they were brought together, the chemistry, the respect.\n\nThe 32-year-old star has scored more than 600 goals during his trophy-laden years in Spain\n\n'They were a group of friends who went out to dinner often; a group that knew how to move forward in moments of difficulty.\n\n'All this was very good, but the importance of leading such a big club as Barca means that you do not have much time to enjoy it.\n\n'The relationship that we have with those who formed part of that group is insurmountable. There are no championships or world titles that can compensate. We gave each other a lot. But there is a moment, due to the natural process of time, that things end.'", "description": "After witnessing Messi score two hat-tricks in a pre-season tour of Scotland as a youngster, Guardiola believed that Barcelona would go on to embark on a clean sweep of trophies.", "authors": ["Daniel Davis For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/17/20290026-0-image-a-2_1572284234449.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
