They established a scholarship program, the Kalamazoo Promise, to pay for a free college education for students like Jones once they graduated from Kalamazoo\u2019s public schools.\n\n\u201cI knew my mom was not going to be able to put me through college, because she didn\u2019t have much money,\u201d says Jones, the youngest of her single mother\u2019s five kids. \u201cBut because I did have the Promise, [I knew] my dreams and the things I wanted to do would be possible, as long as I did what I needed to do in school and actually graduate.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nLast year, Jones, now 23, got a tuition-free bachelor\u2019s degree in psychology from Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo. With her graduation, Jones became one of more than 6,200 students from Kalamazoo who have benefited from the groundbreaking program that has inspired more than 200 place-based scholarships nationwide. But it\u2019s her current job that reflects the ways that Promise continues to refine its approach as it gathers more data on student outcomes. Now Jones works as a \u201creconnection specialist\u201d for the Kalamazoo Promise, trying to help Kalamazoo high school grads in their 20s return to school.\n\nThe Kalamazoo Promise hired Jones as part of a major retooling to try to get more of its disadvantaged students to finish a post-high-school degree. Free-college programs, it turns out, don\u2019t lead everyone to get a college degree. For students in poverty, and for many students of color, the cost of college is a huge barrier\u2014but when you remove it, other barriers reveal themselves.\n\n\u201cAfter looking at the data, we said, \u2018Man, we\u2019ve got to take look at having a more hands-on approach to help students commit,\u2019\u201d says Von Washington, the Promise\u2019s executive director for community relations.\n\nIn Kalamazoo, Michigan, children like these elementary students can benefit from free tuition at a Michigan college if they graduate from one of the public high schools. Programs like Kalamazoo Promise have begun in nearly 200 places around the country. In 2014, Janice M. Brown, board member for the Kalamazoo Promise, announced the program would provide scholarships for private colleges as well as public universities. | AP Images\n\nThe donors offered only vague goals when they approached Kalamazoo school leaders to set up the Promise 14 years ago. \u201cThey said they wanted to invest in youth,\u201d says Janice Brown, then-Kalamazoo\u2019s school superintendent and one of the few people who knows the donors\u2019 identity. Community leaders such as Brown filled in the blanks, predicting that the Promise would make Kalamazoo and its schools more attractive, improve its quality of life and grow its economy.\n\nThe Kalamazoo Promise offers a free tuition scholarship for Kalamazoo Public Schools graduates based on the number of years they spent in the school district: from 100 percent for kids who started there in kindergarten to 65 percent for those who spent four years of high school there. It covers tuition at any of Michigan\u2019s 15 public universities and 30 community colleges\u2014from the selective University of Michigan, with its near-Ivy reputation, to Michigan Tech, a STEM school 500 miles north in the state\u2019s Upper Peninsula. Since 2014, it\u2019s also covered tuition at 15 private colleges in Michigan, including Kalamazoo College, the state\u2019s highest-ranked private school. Since its founding, the Promise has awarded $126 million in scholarships to 6,200 students out of the 7,600 graduates from Kalamazoo\u2019s public high schools since 2006.\n\nDid you have a non-traditional college experience?

It\u2019s succeeded at making the Kalamazoo school district more attractive: enrollment is 25 percent higher than in 2005, a reversal of a long decline. Studies show the Promise Program reduced out-migration of families with children from the district, which includes nearly all of the city of Kalamazoo and most of two suburban townships. Real estate listings often tout homes as eligible for the Promise.\n\nAnd it\u2019s succeeded at boosting college graduation rates\u2014but not by as much as you might think. It boosted the share of Kalamazoo high school graduates who get a bachelor\u2019s degree within six years from 30 percent to 38 percent, according to a study by the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research, the lead researcher for the program. If you include all post-secondary credentials\u2014a bachelor\u2019s, an associate degree or a training certificate for jobs from police officer to wind-turbine technician\u2014the numbers go from 36 percent of all students to 48 percent.\n\nAlex Plair II, 18, of Kalamazoo, top left, was among the first students to benefit from The Kalamazoo Promise, attending Western Michigan University.

But there\u2019s a large racial gap in college completion rates: 51 percent of Promise-eligible white students get at least one credential within six years, while only 19 percent of eligible black students do. So Kalamazoo Promise leaders have ramped up to figure out why and offer help.\n\nFor a decade, the Promise had a staff of two to three people, and the organization was essentially a pass-through for scholarship money. But officials have realized that dollars are not enough to ensure students make it through college; they need continuing guidance. In 2017, Promise expanded to a staff of 14 and began hunting for ways to increase students\u2019 college completion. \u201cStudents who have started on scholarship but are no longer going, we\u2019re trying to find them, talk to them, ask them what the barriers are,\u201d Washington says.\n\nNow, through old addresses, social media and word of mouth, Alexia Jones tracks down Kalamazoo Public Schools graduates who didn\u2019t finish college. She talks them through career goals, administers personality assessments and asks why they didn\u2019t finish.\n\nOften, it\u2019s because poverty and family struggles often get in the way. \u201cWe do not find an overwhelming number of students that say, \u2018Ah, I\u2019ll just wait,\u2019\u201d Washington says. \u201cTen out of 10 times, they can describe to you what their challenge is.\u201d Often, he says, they cite transportation, child care, or taking care of younger brothers and sisters.\n\nIf parenthood or income struggles are keeping former students from college, Jones will connect them with other nonprofits that can help them with housing, transportation, food insecurity and child care. The program has also hired \u201cpromise pathway coaches\u201d who supplement guidance counselors\u2019 work at Kalamazoo\u2019s high schools. Western Michigan University and Kalamazoo Valley Community College, the two most popular schools with Promise students, have hired advisers for similar roles.\n\nDespite the obstacles Promise students still face, the program remains the gold standard among the place-based scholarships it has inspired. Promise programs have sprung up in about 200 communities and states, but most aren\u2019t as generous as Kalamazoo\u2019s, and don\u2019t have as much impact. Some fund only community-college tuition, and many are restricted to top academic performers. About three-fourths, Billings estimates, are \u201clast-dollar\u201d programs, meaning they kick in only after students tap financial-aid programs. That can result in middle-class students getting most of the benefit, while some students on financial aid get no promise money at all.\n\nBy contrast, the Kalamazoo Promise is a \u201cfirst-dollar\u201d scholarship program, which goes straight to tuition before financial aid is applied. At Western Michigan, Alexia Jones got four years of free tuition from the Promise. \u201cPell Grant money paid for my room and board,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t have to worry financially about anything but books.\u201d If not for the Promise, \u201cI definitely would have been in a lot of debt,\u201d Jones says. \u201cI\u2019d probably still be in school, trying to finish a bachelor\u2019s degree.\u201d", "description": "Scholarship money doesn\u2019t remove all the barriers to getting a postsecondary degree.", "authors": ["Shawna Chen", "Erick Trickey"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/f6/3c/51d0d63948249ef21034eeb8b080/chen-lede.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
