The 16-year-old from Manchester, Tenn., killed himself last week after his classmates outed him as bisexual by sharing intimate messages between him and another boy on social media, according to his family. (Screengrab via Facebook/Joshua Smith/Facebook)\n\nChanning Smith\u2019s final Instagram post was a terse message to his followers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna get off social media for awhile,\u201d the 16-year-old from Manchester, Tenn., wrote last week. \u201cI really hate how I can\u2019t trust anyone because those I did were so fake. Bye.\u201d\n\nHours later, Channing was dead, his older brother, Joshua Smith, wrote on Facebook. The teenager committed suicide after discovering that sexually explicit messages he exchanged with another boy had been shared on social media by classmates who wanted to \u201chumiliate and embarrass\u201d him, Smith told WZTV.\n\n\u201cBeing in a small, rural town in the middle of Tennessee, you can imagine being the laughingstock and having to go to school Monday morning,\u201d Smith told WZTV. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t face the humiliation that was waiting on him when he got to school on Monday.\u201d\n\nChanning\u2019s death continues to send shock waves through his community with his family accusing the local district attorney, who has previously stated anti-LGBT views, of failing to seriously investigate the incident. The news even caught the attention of country music legend Billy Ray Cyrus, who made a trip to Manchester on Sunday to perform at a memorial for Channing.\n\nWearing a white T-shirt the words, \u201c#JusticeForChanning,\u201d Cyrus was joined onstage by Channing\u2019s father for a rendition of \u201cAmazing Grace,\u201d the teen\u2019s favorite song.\n\n\u201cMy heart breaks for Channing, his family, his friends and the community,\u201d Cyrus tweeted on Friday. \u201cThis is the saddest story. \u2026 Enough is enough.\u201d\n\nThe tragedy began unfolding late on Sept. 22, when Channing called people he knew in a panic around 10 p.m., his older brother told BuzzFeed News. Images of his private conversations with another boy had been posted on Instagram and Snapchat, outing him as bisexual, his family said. Before the messages were leaked, Channing had not discussed his sexuality publicly or identified as LGBT, BuzzFeed News reported.\n\n\u201cThey were graphic texts and there was no room for Channing to be able to claim it was a misunderstanding,\u201d his brother said.\n\nAt 4 a.m. on Sept. 23, Channing\u2019s father saw that the lights were still on in his son\u2019s room and went to check on him, Smith said. Instead of finding the teenager asleep, his father discovered his body.\n\n\u201cMy brother committed suicide because of the actions of 2 kids that he trusted that turned personal screen shot messages over to social media in a deliberate attempt to assassinate his character,\u201d Smith wrote in a Facebook post Wednesday titled, \u201cBeing gay shouldn\u2019t be a death sentence.\u201d\n\nSmith later added: \u201cNobody deserves to die as they are figuring their way through this complex journey called life.\u201d\n\n\ud835\udc01\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20 \ud835\udc20\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc32 \ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc27\u2019\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc1a \ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21 \ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1e\ud83d\udc80 This is most definitely not a topic that I thought I\u2019d be campaigning... Posted by Joshua Smith on Wednesday, September 25, 2019\n\nA Facebook page called Justice for Channing was created in the wake of the teen\u2019s death and hundreds attended a vigil held Thursday in Manchester, a city of more than 10,000 people located about 65 miles southeast of Nashville.\n\nBut amid emotional eulogies remembering the teenager who loved music, cars and riding his motorcycle, there has been an undertone of anger as the Smith family has condemned bullying while harshly criticizing the Coffee County District Attorney\u2019s Office and school administrators. Channing was a junior at Coffee County Central High School, where a classmate and friend told BuzzFeed News that he was bullied even before his messages went public because he occasionally \u201ctalked in a girly voice and walked with sass.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust because you think it\u2019s cute or funny to make somebody embarrassed or humiliate them, think again,\u201d Crystal Smith, Channing\u2019s mother, said at Thursday\u2019s vigil, WTVF reported. \u201cBecause if somebody would have realized that my son would not be dead.\u201d\n\nIn recent days, Joshua Smith has repeatedly called out District Attorney Craig Northcott\u2019s handling of his little brother\u2019s case. Northcott came under fire earlier this year after a 2018 video surfaced of him saying he did not recognize \u201chomosexual marriage\u201d and would not prosecute same-sex domestic violence cases, the Tennessean reported.\n\n\u201cI was told by the lead investigator in Coffee County that he was pushing to have the kids charged criminally and the DA\u2019s office has decided that they did not want to pursue it,\u201d Smith told WZTV last week.\n\nNorthcott released a statement on Thursday disputing the claims, noting that no charging decisions have been made because an investigation is still ongoing.\n\n\u201cMy office has encouraged, cooperated in and supported the investigation into the events leading to this death,\u201d the statement said, according to the Tennessee Holler. \u201cAny report that my office has failed or refused to act is inaccurate.\u201d\n\n\u202aSTATEMENT from DA Craig Northcott on the Coffee County teen who took his own life after being outed by other teens. ... Posted by The Tennessee Holler on Friday, September 27, 2019\n\nSmith has also gone after high school administrators, accusing them of not taking action against the two alleged bullies and for failing to properly acknowledge Channing\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t made any mention about him or his death on their website, on Facebook, anywhere,\u201d Smith told BuzzFeed News.\n\nAdditionally, some students who tried to pay tribute to the teenager during a homecoming rally on Friday said the school\u2019s principal made them take off T-shirts and put away posters that had \u201cJustice for Channing\u201d emblazoned on them.\n\nSchool officials could not be reached for comment late Sunday.\n\nAt Sunday\u2019s memorial, however, \u201cJustice for Channing\u201d was everywhere \u2014 on shirts and homemade signs and even on Joshua Smith\u2019s arm, in the form of a new tattoo.\n\n\u201cI can assure you, your school hopes you forget, your town hopes you forget,\u201d Joshua Smith told the large crowd that had gathered. \u201cBut we\u2019re not going to let that happen. \u2026 Action is going to be taken. We don\u2019t get Channing back, that\u2019s done, can\u2019t go backwards. But we can use this incident to create change moving forward.\u201d\n\nBilly Ray Cyrus at Rotary Park Posted by Thunder Radio on Sunday, September 29, 2019\n\nMeanwhile, Channing\u2019s mother remembered her son as someone who always made time to help friends in need.\n\n\u201cHe was the one kids went to,\u201d she said. \u201cHe would stay up all night talking to them, trying to talk them out of anything. I know he has talked kids out of suicide because he told me he did.\u201d\n\nShe later added: \u201cI remember many times when I was having a hard time, I\u2019d break down and cry and he\u2019d come up to me and put his arms around me and say, \u2018Momma, it\u2019d be all right, it\u2019d be okay,\u2019 and that was Channing.\u201d", "description": "\u201cNobody deserves to die as they are figuring their way through this complex journey called life,\u201d Channing Smith's brother wrote in a Facebook post.", "authors": ["Allyson Chiu", "Reporter With The Morning Mix Team", "September At Am", "Allyson Chiu Is A Reporter With The Washington Post'S Morning Mix Team.
