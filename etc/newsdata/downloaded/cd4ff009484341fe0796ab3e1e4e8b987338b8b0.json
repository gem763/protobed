This piece has been updated to reflect the latest news.\n\n(CNN) The statistic is shocking and, well, not: For an estimated one in 16 American women, according to a study published Monday in the medical journal JAMA Internal Medicine, her \"first time\" having sex was \"an unwanted first sexual intercourse that is physically forced or coerced.\" As one of the study co-authors pointed out, \"it is accurate\" to call this what it is: rape. Among the women who experienced not first-time sex but first-time rape, the average age was about fifteen and a half. Their assailants were are on average six years older -- adult men preying on girls.\n\nJill Filipovic\n\nWomen's stories of rape, assault, harassment and coercion are, at the very least, increasingly told out loud. And it's hard to read this new study and not draw parallels between other recent events -- most notably, the resurgence of sexual misconduct and assault claims against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh -- all of which he has vehemently denied -- and questions about what we do with them.\n\nWith this story back in the news and threatening to delegitimize Kavanaugh's place on the court (and certainly further tarnish his legacy), conservatives have gone on the offensive. In this, the Times' controversial mishandling of an additional accusation and the President's bombastic tweets for the Justice Department to \"rescue\" Kavanaugh (who has denied Ramirez's allegations) have given them ammunition. Critics are calling Ramirez and the Times' reporters discredited liars and even suggesting that having a penis pushed at you isn't such a big deal . And at least on the latter point, they're right, in a way: sexualized acts of harassment, disrespect, contempt and dominance are constants in most women's lives. They are our normal. And I suspect nearly every woman in the country has been on the receiving end of male dominance via sexual degradation at some point. Maybe it was the jolt of being cat-called when you were 11 and walking down the street in your new summer shorts. Maybe it was a guy who thrust his penis in your face at a college party, because his friends thought it was funny to humiliate and shock you.\n\nIt's that steady hum of normality that sets the stage for the kind of pervasive coercion, control and violence that in turn produces the striking finding that millions of American women were raped the first time they had sex, and many millions more raped thereafter. These rapes, the JAMA study finds, have serious consequences for the women who experience them. Women who are raped the first time they have sex are more likely to have unplanned first pregnancies and abortions; they are more likely to experience a series of gynecological issues including pelvic inflammatory disease and endometriosis; and they are more likely to carry psychological scars that carry over into the physical, reporting more illicit drug use, trouble completing tasks, and fair or poor health.\n\nRead More", "description": "A new study showing the prevalence of force in American girls' first experiences with sex puts into sharp relief a moment when new reporting about allegations against Brett Kavanaugh puts our country's treatment of women and girls who endure violence and degradation under a microscope.
