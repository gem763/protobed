All the bills are under my name, how can she prove that she's been here for five years,\" he said.\n\nHe said his wife and daughter \"feel that they want to go back\" because there is \"too much pressure.\"\n\n(Image: Dan Kitwood)\n\nNow 17-years-old, his daughter has lived her whole life in the UK and is currently studying at a college in Derby.\n\nPart of the reason he is reluctant to go anywhere is because if on returning to the UK, the family are split at border control, it would \"ruin her education.\"\n\n\"She's been in English schools since she was five years old and they still want me to prove it that she's been here for more than five years.\n\n(Image: Dan Kitwood)\n\n\"It's funny, well it's not funny, but the way they've asked me to prove it, it's got to be funny,\" he added.\n\nThe Derby doorman said he is \"annoyed\" about Brexit and \"angry\" with the people who voted for it.\n\nHe added: \"Whatever they voted for, even if they voted to leave the EU, fine, but leave people living here alone.\"", "description": "The Czech native says he has been experiencing hostility at work since the EU referendum", "authors": ["Noah Martin", "Image", "Reuters", "Peter Summers", "Dan Kitwood"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20738630.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_FILE-PHOTO-An-anti-Brexit-protester-waves-an-EU-flag-outside-the-Houses-ofParliamentin-London11.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
