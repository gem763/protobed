However, that case has not yet been confirmed under the federal definition.\n\nIn the U.S., there have been more than 800 cases and 13 deaths.\n\nDrouin said people who switched to vaping to cut down on smoking cigarettes should not go back to cigarettes. But she also raised concerns about the risks of vaping.\n\n\"The message to the population, and to clinicians, is that there are other products, smoking cessation programs, and products that are already approved and safe ... and those products should be the first choice for those who want to quit smoking,\" Drouin said.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reported symptoms of the illness include:\n\nCough, shortness of breath, or chest pain.\n\nNausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.\n\nFatigue, fever, or abdominal pain.\n\nAnyone who has used an e-cigarette or vaping products, and has experienced these symptoms is advised to consult a health-care professional.\n\n'Vaping is not without risk'\n\nTwo weeks ago, Quebec's Health Ministry issued a warning about the risks of developing a pulmonary illness as a result of vaping.\n\nDr. Horacio Arruda, provincial director of public health, said what they know is there is a link between the illness and people who vape.\n\nDr. Myl\u00e8ne Drouin, left, public health director for Montreal, and Dr. Horacio Arruda, provincial public health director, say anyone who have never vaped shouldn't start. (Radio-Canada)\n\nBut because there are different models of e-cigarettes, and different vaping products, it is unclear whether the issue is with a specific company or product.\n\nThey stress that anyone who doesn't already smoke or who has never used an e-cigarette shouldn't start now.\n\n\"Vaping is not without risk, and its long-term effects aren't yet known,\" Arruda said.\n\nA group of Canadian health organizations recently called on the federal parties to regulate the e-cigarette and vaping industry.", "description": "A Quebec resident has been diagnosed with Canada's first case of a severe vaping-related breathing illness, federal\u00a0health officials have confirmed.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5270997.1567642634!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/oregon-vaping-death.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
