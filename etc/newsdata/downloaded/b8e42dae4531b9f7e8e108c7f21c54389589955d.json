They each have their own history and experiences and bring them together in a special day and everything that happens afterwards.\n\nFor Becky Brotherhood, 43, and Lee Markham, 45, the story that brought them to their wedding day hasn\u2019t always been easy. But they decided to honour the moments that had brought them together in a touching way \u2013 Becky wore a wedding dress made up of patches crafted by her friends and family.\n\nBut let\u2019s rewind a bit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecky is a massage therapist, but used to be a nurse. After welcoming her son she was diagnosed with breast cancer and needed to undergo chemotherapy, which prompted her to spend the next few years focusing on health and leaving nursing behind.\n\nBecky and Lee on their wedding day (Picture: Guy Mace Photography)\n\nLee is a writer. He published his novel, The Truants, a few years back, and also works as a writer and narrative designer for Connected Places Catapult.\n\nThey met just under five years ago, just as Becky was getting the confidence to re-train as a massage therapist to help others who feel \u2018like their body has turned against them\u2019.\n\nEach with children from previous relationships and difficult experiences in the past, the couple fell in love and brought their families together.\n\nBecky never thought she would get married again, and often said as much, but one day decided to ask Lee if he fancied getting married\u2026 over Facebook Messenger.\n\n\u2018It was the day that Harry and Meghan got married,\u2019 Becky told Metro.co.uk. \u2018I\u2019m not an avid follower of the royals, but something about their story \u2013 how sections of the establishment were sniffy or judgemental about Meghan, or the fact that she\u2019d been divorced made her somehow less worthy \u2013 just really hit home on that day.\n\n\u2018I felt that perhaps my decision to not to was actually more about what people might think, and less about what I actually wanted, or how I felt about him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018So I asked him \u2013 and that fact that I asked means so much to me now: to hell with rules and tradition and what people think.\u2019\n\nLee thought she was joking, but said yes just in case. Becky had to send a photo of herself looking overjoyed to convince Lee that yes, she did in fact want to marry him.\n\nThen it came to the wedding planning, which is when Becky came up with the idea of having her wedding dress crafted by people she loves.\n\nThe couple tied the knot in a simple ceremony in September (Picture: Guy Mace Photography)\n\n\u2018Standing in front of my soul mate at the age of 43, knowing that we both have rich histories and six children between us, it felt wrong to buy something new and off the shelf,\u2019 Becky explains. \u2018It didn\u2019t feel right and didn\u2019t fit us as a couple.\n\n\u2018One of the most special things about our love is that we love each other because of our pasts. They\u2019re not something we have to look beyond or gloss over, and the family home we are both building right now is open and welcoming to everyone.\n\n\u2018We both have scars and losses \u2013 physically and metaphorically, and I wanted that to be reflected and held in every part of my dress, bravely, unashamedly, and with love.\u2019\n\nBecky\u2019s skilled in the sewing arena, so at first planned to just make her own gown. But then some of her clients started giving her bits of fabric that were sentimental to them, asking her to use them in the dress so they could be a part of something wonderful. Some people offered the buttons from their own wedding dress or the lace from a parent\u2019s gown while others brought sparkly fabric all the way from Iran.\n\nBecky\u2019s dress was made from patches and sentimental items from friends and family (Picture: Becky Brotherhood/Lee Markham)\n\nJewellery, buttons, and lace from old wedding gowns were all included in the design (Picture: Becky Brotherhood/Lee Markham)\n\nThat inspired Becky to invite her bridal party to get involved, asking them if they could offer up their own patch to add to the dress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSomething magical happened as a result. As many of the people weren\u2019t so confident in their crafting skills, they came over to see Becky and have a patch-making session over a cup of tea or a glass of wine, giving each bit of fabric a shared memory to go along with it.\n\nBecky told us: \u2018It ended up being almost like a month-long hen do, where friends would come up, and we\u2019d catch up, and spend quality time together too and with such busy lives, when does that ever happen? And it really felt like the dress captured that energy of reconnection too.\n\n\u2018All of which was really brought home to us when one of our closest friends wrote a blog about the dress for Hen Heaven and all of a sudden we started getting emails and calls from the local and national press \u2013 it\u2019s all been pretty crazy \u2013 but clearly the story the dress tells came across loud and clear.\u2019\n\nThe entire process of making the dress took three weeks (Picture: Becky Brotherhood/Lee Markham)\n\nThe patches were then added to an original pattern Becky had made out of an old sheet she found in the attic. She ended up with 50 or so pieces of fabric that each had to be sewn into the dress.\n\nOther important parts had to be included, too \u2013 including Lee\u2019s dad\u2019s wedding ring, Becky\u2019s mum\u2019s wedding ring, the buttons from Becky\u2019s sister\u2019s gown, and beads nicked from mum\u2019s jewellery box.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThankfully it all \u2018came together beautifully\u2019, with Becky and her loved ones having made the gown in the space of three weeks.\n\nWhile the dress was technically \u2018free\u2019 in the sense that Becky didn\u2019t have to buy new material or buy a ready-made gown, it has immense personal value.\n\nThere were more than 50 patches in total (Picture: Becky Brotherhood/Lee Markham)\n\nThe patches all went into a dress Becky made from an old sheet from the attic (Picture: Becky Brotherhood/Lee Markham)\n\n\u2018I absolutely wouldn\u2019t say it was free\u2026 simply in terms of man-hours \u2013 not just my own, but all the time put in by everyone that made a patch \u2013 it was pretty intensive,\u2019 says Becky.\n\n\u2018Then the fabrics and materials and some of the precious items woven into it, these things were all utterly irreplaceable, and in that way priceless.\n\n\u2018I could have spent thousands on a dress, but I would never have been able to buy the dress I wore from anywhere. The only way it could have existed at all was to have made it in the way it was made. Cost didn\u2019t come into it at all.\n\nGorgeous, right? (Picture: Becky Brotherhood/Lee Markham)\n\nWe\u2019re huge fans of the backless bit (Picture: Becky Brotherhood/Lee Markham)\n\n\u2018It was an amazing experience. Once the project was up and running, it seemed to find an energy and life of its own, and in that way this curious sense of calm came over me, and I actually felt a real absence of nerves.\n\n\u2018Seeing everyone that loves us, and supports us, and who have been there for us through tough times, and good times \u2013 seeing all those people rally round and just love getting involved, and creating such wonderful, heartfelt pieces of art, essentially, it\u2019s like I felt lifted up on their shoulders and carried to the day.\u2019\n\nWhile Becky managed to be calm through a project that would have sent most of us into a spin, Lee is quick to note that she had a half-hour panic attack the Thursday before the big day.\n\nLee said: \u2018It\u2019s like all those nerves and anxiety that were supposed to be there hit in one dose in that moment \u2013 \u201cwhat if the dress is rubbish? what if I look stupid?\u201d.\n\n\u2018But that was it. It had all gone by the morning!\u2019\n\nThe wedding was a brilliant day, made even more special by the dress (Picture: Guy Mace Photography)\n\nThere are so many tiny details to study (Picture: Guy Mace Photography)\n\nOn the day of the wedding, 28 September 2019, Becky walked down the aisle wearing a dress packed with memories and made with love.\n\nBecky is proud not only of the dress itself, but how the project has inspired others to get creative.\n\n\u2018Everyone was so proud of their efforts,\u2019 Becky said. \u2018It\u2019s inspired 10-year-old girls to make their own prom dresses one day, and some have even asked for a sewing machine for Christmas! I am so proud to have inspired this in the girls!\u2019\n\n\u2018The workshops I did with the kids also made me up my game in terms of dress style. Being told \u201comg this is going to be better than an actual paid-for wedding dress\u201d made me feel that I could not fail to deliver.\n\n\u2018I wanted to show them what they could do if they put their minds and hearts into something. I hope I did that.\u2019\n\nBecky made the dress even more special by keeping the finished creation secret from everyone until the day of the wedding.\n\nOf course, the reaction was glorious.\n\n\u2018They were all waiting to see what I\u2019d done with their creation,\u2019 Becky tells us. \u2018Everyone owned it. And that was the best part about it all. It felt like I\u2019d drawn everyone together, it did feel like a community tapestry of love and blessings\u2026. truly special.\u2019\n\nLee and Becky made things official in a simple civil ceremony, surrounded by family and close friends and followed by a group trip to the pub.\n\nDo you have an amazing wedding story to share?
