This subset of the industry includes basic financial services offered to the general public \u2014 but the face of the general public is changing. Appealing to Gen Z requires retail banks to cater to the attributes that set them apart from older generations Caiaimage/Chris Ryan/Getty Images\n\nAs millennials and Gen Zers continue aging into the workforce and becoming some of society's biggest earners, banks are being forced to adapt their solutions to match their digital-first preferences, or risk losing them to fintechs and emerging players.\n\nBelow we've outlined the state of the retail banking industry, and how banks are staying on top of evolving market trends.\n\nWhat is retail banking?\n\nRetail banking, also known as personal or consumer banking, refers to the mass-market banking activities that serve the general public. Common retail banking services include checking and savings accounts, debit and credit cards, mortgages and loans, and certificates of deposit. ATMs and customer deposits are some of the most common retail banking services Associated Press\n\nRetail vs commercial banking\n\nThough retail banking services are often provided by commercial banks, they are specific to individual consumers, whereas commercial banking refers to financial services provided to both the general public and large corporate clients.\n\nRetail banking statistics\n\nAs digital and mobile-first features permeate the banking industry, customers are taking their money into their own hands \u2014 literally. Here's how important cutting-edge features are for retail customer acquisition and retention:\n\nIn 2017 alone, retail banks in the US spent $20.2 billion on digital transformation, and that's expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.5% into 2020\n\nAccording to the global retail banking research director at IDC, some of the largest incumbent banks are spending over 40% of their IT budgets on digital transformation Mobile banking is a key driver of retail bank selection Business Insider Intelligence\n\nCustomers are frustrated with their banking relationships with incumbents \u2014 and if they're not resolved, the top 10 banks in the US risk losing 11% of their customers, equating to about $344 billion in lost retail deposits and a revenue hit of $16 billion\n\nBusiness Insider Intelligence's second Mobile Banking Competitive Edge Study found 61% of mobile banking users said that they'd research a bank's mobile capabilities before opening an account\n\nFour of the top five most in-demand features in the study were pertained to mobile\n\nConsumers' most desirable mobile-banking feature is the ability to temporarily turn off a payment card from their phone \u2014 ranked \"extremely valuable\" by 47% of respondents\n\nTypes of retail banking\n\nWithin the retail banking industry, there are specialized subdivisions of banks that exist either to offer a smaller more targeted set of products or to serve a specific customer base. Below are three of the most common types of retail banks.\n\nConsumer banks\n\nConsumer banks are banks that are primarily focused on accepting deposits and making loans to individual customers.\n\nCooperative banks\n\nCooperative banks are customer-owned and operated for a common purpose \u2014 often to provide financial services to particular groups or economic sections of society such as farmers or small business owners. They operate under the cooperative principle of democratic decision-making and open membership, but can lend to members or non-members. Credit unions are a subdivision of retail banking David McNew/Getty Images\n\nCredit Unions\n\nCredit unions are member-owned not-for-profit institutions that provide financial services to their members. Because they are cooperative, credit unions seek to promote the best interests of their members by offering better savings rates, lower loan rates, and fewer fees rather than earning profits.\n\nRetail banking financial products & services\n\nRetail banking services are typically carried out at local bank branches within communities \u2014 though many are increasingly offered online as well. Common retail banking services include:\n\nChecking and savings accounts\n\nDebit cards\n\nCredit cards\n\nATM cards\n\nMortgages\n\nHome equity loans\n\nPersonal loans\n\nTraveler's checks\n\nCertificates of deposit\n\nRetail banking trends and outlook\n\nConsumer frustrations with legacy institutions and growing willingness to use digital channels for financial services have accelerated the shift to online, mobile-first, and even digital-only banking. Tech-savvy players are redefining retail banking in major markets around the world \u2014 acquiring customers at pace and ramping up pressure on established firms. Marcus by Goldman Sachs is the incumbent's digital challenger Marcus.com\n\nDriven by innovation-friendly regulatory reforms, these companies have especially gained traction in Europe over the last three years, but recent developments suggest these startups are finally poised for the spotlight in the US.\n\nAnd as a result of flaring competition from neobanks, long-standing incumbents are deploying digital-only retail offerings of their own. Most notably, Goldman Sachs launched Marcus in 2016, an online platform offering highly competitive core products including fixed-rate, fee-free unsecured loans and high-yield savings accounts.\n\nJPMorgan Chase launched its own challenger, Finn, nationwide in 2018, but shuttered the digital bank only a year later, likely because there wasn't significant enough differentiation between Finn and the firm's conventional mobile banking app.\n\nCiti has also stated plans to launch a challenger bank and Wells Fargo is testing its digital offshoot, Greenhouse. So far, incumbent responses to neobanks have been packed with digital features and armed with the resources of their legacy parents, which could give them a considerable advantage over fintechs.\n\nLearn More\n\nWith digital and mobile-first features redefining the banking industry as we know it, it's crucial for top decision-makers in financial services to stay ahead of tomorrow's trends.
