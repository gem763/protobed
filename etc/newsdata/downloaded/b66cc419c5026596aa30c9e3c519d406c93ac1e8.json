We know to batten down the house, get canned goods, have water ready, and stay home.\"\n\nBut Hagigal said Bahamians \"weren't prepared for were the 15-20 foot storm surges,\" that shocked communities and caused \"roofs to cave in on people,\" and from dumping huge amounts of rain and wind.\n\nAt least five people were killed, and the death toll could rise as rescuers search ravaged neighborhoods, homes, and roads on the country's islands, including Abaco and Grand Bahama.\n\nAhead of the storm's landfall, experts found it difficult to forecast, but Dorian quickly proved to be a devastating combination for the low-lying islands.\n\nSome areas of the Bahamas got up to 30 inches of rain.

But as the Earth's oceans and air get warmer, tropical storms overall are getting stronger, wetter, and slower. Hagigal pointed to climate change as a key factor in the storm's force that came as a surprise to the country.\n\n\"Our building code is pretty strong, and we've always been pretty confident that we could handle whatever's thrown at us, but climate change has really switched things up, and we're just absolutely destroyed from this storm,\" Hagigal said.\n\nShe said she weathered the storm at her home on Nassau, the capital of the Bahamas on the island of New Providence, and has been volunteering to send resources to other islands since the hurricane let up.\n\nRead more: Photos show the destruction Hurricane Dorian has caused in the Bahamas from a punishing storm surge, up to 30 inches of rain, and 185 mph winds\n\nAn aerial photo shows the aftermath of the Hurricane Dorian damage over an unspecified location in the Bahamas, in this September 2, 2019 photo Coast Guard Air Station Clearwater / US Coast Guard / Handout / Reuters\n\nSeeing 'everything you've worked for, all of your memories' washed away\n\nThrough the storm, many locals posted videos and pictures showing the intense rain, winds, and flooding, including Michael Pintard, the Bahamas Minister for Agriculture, who posted a video of the view from inside his home on Grand Bahama, saying there \"has to be a minimum of 20 feet [of water] above the ground.\"\n\nHagigal said seeing similar videos spread across social media from other islands left her in a state of \"shock and panic.\"\n\n\"We are such a small, close-knit community as an island nation, it's like we all know each other and word travels fast,\" Hagigal said. \"So one or two of us started to have flooding problems and took videos of the waves crashing on people's homes [and everyone saw.]\"\n\nHagigal said she was \"horrified\" to hear that a friend's family was stranded on the top of their home as the surrounding area was overrun with flooding. She put a call into a Royal Bahamas Defense Force base and added the family's address to a list for potential rescues.\n\nAfter the call, she said she gathered \"over 100\" more addresses from people who reached out to her online or over the phone for their families to be rescued.\n\n\"It's just horrifying, everything you've worked for, all of your memories, all of the things that you hold safe, your home,\" Hagigal said of the widespread damage that will take at least weeks to address.\n\nRead more about Hurricane Dorian:\n\nHurricane Dorian is slowly inching from the Bahamas to the US, leaving devastation in its wake\n\nBefore-and-after images show how Hurricane Dorian's storm surge put a Bahamas airport underwater\n\nHurricane Dorian has struck the Bahamas, with Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas in its path.
