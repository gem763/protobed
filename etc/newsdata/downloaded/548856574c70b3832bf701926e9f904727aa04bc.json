At 25, he\u2019s a leader for the Redskins.\n\nQuarterback Colt McCoy did not practice again Wednesday, though Gruden continued to insist that McCoy is progressing after suffering a setback in recovering from three offseason leg surgeries. McCoy suffered a broken fibula Dec. 3.\n\nAD\n\nCornerback Fabian Moreau also missed practice with an ankle injury and seems unlikely to play Sunday. Outside linebacker Cassanova McKinzy, who had a concussion in the final preseason game, was limited in Wednesday\u2019s practice and is still in the concussion protocol like Reed. Defensive lineman Caleb Brantley also was limited Wednesday as he deals with a foot injury that has slowed him at times in recent weeks.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Redskins are already getting big contributions out of their rookie class\n\nNFL teams thought Donald Penn was retired. Now he\u2019s preparing to start for the Redskins.\n\nMontez Sweat has big-time talent. His Redskins teammates are teaching him the little things.\n\nAD", "description": "Washington cornerback Fabian Moreau appears less likely to be available.", "authors": ["Les Carpenter", "Reporter Covering Washington Redskins"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/uF7MM6Orfy-xA_H45ktRQxehzlU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JWQF6CWFNMI6TC7XZXRNTYEQKU.jpg"}
