But the flare-up in unrest indicates Abiy might be losing support among his power base.\n\nProtesters outside Jawar's house on Thursday chanted: \"We don't want Abiy, we don't want Abiy.\"\n\nThe demonstrations began on Tuesday after police surrounded Jawar's house.\n\nProtests quickly spread to other parts of the capital and the cities of Adama, Ambo, Harar and Jimma, residents said.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of violence, Jawar supporters erected tents outside his house on Thursday and brought matresses, signalling they intended to stay there.\n\n\"One week, one month, we don't care, we will stay here until the government tells us why they did this to Jawar,\" said a young protester, who asked for anonymity for fear of repercussions from the security forces.\n\nHalf a dozen policemen stood outside Jawar's house a distance from the protesters.\n\n\"Today the city is calm this morning but the road to Addis Ababa is closed by the young men,\" an official said.\n\nShimeles Abdisa, vice president of the Oromia region, also acknowledged some deaths in an interview with regional media on Wednesday night.\n\n\n\n\"I feel very sorry for the lives that have been lost today,\" he said. \"I want to express my sympathy on behalf of Oromia regional state. We could replace the property which was destroyed but sadly we can't get back people who lost their lives.\"\n\nDivisions exposed\n\nJawar, an Ethiopian-born US citizen, mobilised many thousands of young men all over the Oromia region to protest against the government from 2016 to 2018, building pressure that led to the resignation of Abiy's predecessor, Hailemariam Desalegn, and Abiy's appointment.\n\nThough Jawar and Abiy were photographed together frequently last year, remarks by the prime minister on Tuesday suggested frustration with media entrepreneurs such as Jawar, who are seen to be promoting ethnic agendas ahead of Ethiopian unity.\n\nThe unrest highlights divisions within the ethnic Oromo support base that swept Abiy to power last year - divisions that could undermine his position ahead of elections planned for May 2020.", "description": "Jawar Mohammed organised the protests that helped bring Nobel Prize-winning Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to power.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/24/85fdd07e4b584f188d5e4934e70917dc_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
