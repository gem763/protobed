I don't know that he's concerned about American policy,\u201d former Rep. Sean Duffy, a Tea Party Republican from Wisconsin, said on CNN this morning.\n\n(Duffy, a paid political commentator for CNN, is also a known conspiracy theorist, who has tried to downplay Dylann Roof\u2019s murder of nine black churchgoers in 2015, and previously claimed that an aide to Hillary Clinton has ties to the Muslim Brotherhood.)\n\n\u201cWe all have an affinity to our homeland where we came from,\u201d Duffy said of Vindman. \u201cHe has an affinity for the Ukraine.\"\n\nAnd on Monday night, Fox News host Laura Ingraham suggested that Vindman is too friendly with Ukrainian officials, who she says \u201csought advice from him about how to deal with [Rudy] Giuliani.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne of Ingraham\u2019s guests, John Yoo \u2014 who worked for George W. Bush\u2019s Justice Department and penned a memo justifying the use of torture \u2014 chimed in, \u201cSome people might call that espionage.\u201d\n\nFox News host and Trump favorite Brian Kilmeade also suggested on air Tuesday morning that Vindman has little allegiance to the U.S.\n\n\"We also know he was born in the Soviet Union, emigrated with his family. Young. He tends to feel simpatico with the Ukraine,\" Kilmeade said.\n\nAccording to a copy of Vindman\u2019s testimony obtained by the New York Times, Vindman plans to tell members of the House that Trump\u2019s July call with Zelensky \u2014 in which the U.S. president tried to strongarm Zelensky into opening a corruption investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter \u2014 alarmed him.\n\n\u201cI did convey certain concerns internally to national security officials in accordance with my decades of experience and training, sense of duty, and obligation to operate within the chain of command,\u201d Vindman will testify on Tuesday.\n\nTrump, as he is wont to do, weighed in on Vindman\u2019s testimony on Twitter.\n\n\u201cWhy are people that I never even heard of testifying about the call. Just READ THE CALL TRANSCRIPT AND THE IMPEACHMENT HOAX IS OVER! Ukrain [sic] said NO PRESSURE,\u201d Trump wrote.\n\nCover: Lt. Col.
