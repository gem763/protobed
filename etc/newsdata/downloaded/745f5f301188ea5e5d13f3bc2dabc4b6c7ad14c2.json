Spot gold was little changed at $1,531.35 per ounce,\n\nat 0750 GMT, after rising to its highest level since Sept. 5 at\n\n$1,535.60 on Tuesday. U.S. gold futures GCv1 fell 0.2% to\n\n$1,536.60 per ounce.\n\n\"Compounding into the macro weakness we have the tumult in\n\n(the) political landscape brought about by the impeachment\n\nprocess,\" said AxiTrader market strategist Stephen Innes.\n\n\"The risk could lead to lower equity market and undermine\n\nthe U.S. dollar and that could be good for gold.\"\n\nWeak U.S. consumer confidence data also ratcheted up\n\nconcerns over the global economy. \"It stoked Fed rate-cut speculation, driving down yields and\n\nthereby boosting the relative appeal of non-interest-bearing\n\nassets epitomised by gold,\" said Ilya Spivak, a senior currency\n\nstrategist at DailyFx.\n\nMeanwhile, the dollar steadied in Asian trade, and stocks\n\nfell as U.S. political uncertainty added to worries about\n\neconomies strained by the Sino-U.S. trade row. USD/ MKTS/GLOB\n\nTrump's rhetoric on China turned harsh once again on Tuesday\n\nas he delivered a stinging rebuke to Beijing's trade practices\n\nat the United Nations General Assembly, saying he would not\n\naccept a \"bad deal\" in U.S.-China trade negotiations.\n\n\"The market is still waiting for some more definitive news\n\non the trade front... Investors who are long are going to sell\n\nat such a high level,\" AxiTrader's Innes said.\n\nThe tone of Trump's speech was at odds with some recent\n\nsteps by China to meet his request for purchases of more\n\nAmerican farm products. The two parties are meeting again in\n\nOctober for talks.\n\nSpot gold may rise more to $1,546 per ounce, as it has\n\ncleared a resistance at $1,524, according to Reuters technical\n\nanalyst Wang Tao. Among other precious metals, palladium XPD= dipped 0.3%\n\nto$1,667.58 an ounce, after hitting a peak of $1,676.53 earlier\n\nin the session.\n\nSilver was steady at $18.58 an ounce, while platinum\n\nXPT= dropped 0.3% to $950.46.\n\n\n\n", "description": "PRECIOUS-Gold steadies below 3-week peak, Trump probe lends support", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEF0N0TA_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
