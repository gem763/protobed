Their attorney, Ron Austin, says the homes built by the foundation in the Lower Ninth Ward have infrastructural issues and residents have reported being sick.\n\nPitt's foundation sought to build 150 homes in the Lower Ninth ward of New Orleans that were storm-safe, solar-powered, and 'green' for the price of $150,000 in 2007, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.\n\nMore than 100 green Make It Right houses were eventually built in 2008. The foundation sued the principal architect last year saying his designs were defective.\n\nTwo homeowners filed the suit.

The homes also had structural problems, electrical problems, plumbing issues and rotten wood, according to the lawsuit.\n\nMore than 100 green Make It Right houses were eventually built in 2008. Pitt reportedly spent $12million to get the houses built\n\nResidents complained that the homes aren't what they signed up for with many houses falling apart, some with rotting wood, plumbing issues, and roofs caving in\n\nThe complaint adds that Make It Right arranged for engineer inspections of the home 'allegedly brought in specifically to render a report on the state of the Make It Right homes'. But homeowners were never given access to those reports.\n\nThe lawsuit asserts that engineers found issues in the home but the charity didn't inform homeowners of the problems, citing a portion of the foundation's 2013 tax filing which accounts for $4.3million in 'warranty and repair liabilities'.\n\nIt also adds that Make It Right gave homeowners a nondisclosure agreement and documents that bound them to arbitration before agreeing to making repairs.\n\nThe lawsuit claims that the plaintiffs' homes were 'deficiently constructed and built' with 'defective products' that led to damage such as the growth of mold and air quality problems due to improper ventilation\n\nThe homes also had structural problems, electrical problems, plumbing issues and rotten wood, according to the lawsuit\n\nBut, the lawsuit says that the charity didn't explain these documents to the homeowners, 'fraudulently' obtaining signatures 'on agreements that would deprive homeowners of important legal rights while the homeowners are under duress.'\n\nThe complaint adds the homeowners noticed problems with the home as early as 2013 but they thought Make It Right would sort out the repairs.\n\n'The homeowners are gravely concerned that their homes, which suffer serious structural problems, will not last as long as their mortgages,' the complaint says.", "description": "Brad Pitt and other foundation directors asked the court to remove them from the lawsuit in November of last year, saying they weren't personally responsible for the construction.", "authors": ["Matthew Wright For Dailymail.Com", "Marlene Lenthang For Dailymail.Com", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/19/20223094-0-image-a-29_1572116390669.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
