Some reviewers have written that the show, while ambitious, is \u201cunwieldy\u201d over the first six episodes made available to critics. Others have argued the series doesn\u2019t \u201cespecially need\u201d a supernatural specter or have said the show has \u201cmore potential as a historical drama.\u201d These reactions all point in some way to the fact that the Infamy\u2019s dual sources of terror don\u2019t quite cohere into a single story. Part of the problem may lie in the writing and plotting. But the show\u2014by its very nature as a grim series about the United States turning on its citizens and their families\u2014also seems to offer different things to different viewers, depending on their own proximity to such real-life experiences.\n\nThe supernatural horror of Infamy comes mostly from an otherworldly antagonist named Yuko (played by Kiki Sukezane), who is introduced in the first episode. She\u2019s an unsettling yet frustratingly vague menace. Is she a ghost? A demon? Is she a culturally specific villain that requires a basic familiarity with Japanese folklore, or is she more of a typical, vengeful spirit? Even the Japanese words that the older characters use to describe her shift, utterance by utterance\u2014obake, yuurei, youkai, bake mono\u2014as they try to figure out what she is.\n\nBeyond issues of taxonomy, Yuko\u2019s powers are inconsistent. In some scenes, she appears only as a creepy interruption, while at other times, glimpses of her cause characters to go insane or hurt themselves. This isn\u2019t to say that Infamy must define its villain early on in the season, or even at all. (Season 1 of The Terror similarly featured a mystifying monster but had a better grasp of its main narrative.) And yet it is hard to take Yuko seriously when it\u2019s unclear how she fits into the story or how she can affect the characters. Even when the series develops her further, Yuko primarily inspires speculation and confusion\u2014an effect that dampens, rather than amplifies, the show\u2019s horror.\n\nIn sharp contrast to its treatment of Yuko, Infamy renders the internment in painstaking detail, as if to suggest that this is what should really scare audiences. The forced relocation and detention of 120,000 Japanese Americans during World War II was shameful, and Infamy depicts the many indignities an entire community suffered. The stakes are high from the first episode, which builds to the events of December 7, 1941. When news about the Imperial Japanese Army bombing Pearl Harbor breaks, two of the main characters\u2014a young man named Chester Nakayama and his father Henry (played by Derek Mio and Shingo Usami, respectively)\u2014happen to be at a U.S. naval base to answer questions about a Yuko-related death. The room erupts into chaos around the father and son, who have no idea what has happened; only viewers know what history has in store for them.", "description": "AMC\u2019s anthology series wants to disturb viewers with its depiction of the Japanese American internment.
