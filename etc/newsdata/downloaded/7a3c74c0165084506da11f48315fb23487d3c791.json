All preparations for the operation have been completed,\u201d the Turkish Defence Ministry said on Twitter early on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt is essential to establish a safe zone/peace corridor to contribute to our region\u2019s peace and stability, and for Syrians to achieve a safe life,\u201d it said.\n\nTrump\u2019s warning on Turkey\u2019s economy appeared aimed at placating critics who accused him of abandoning the Syrian Kurds by pulling out U.S. forces. The decision drew criticism from Democrats and a rebuke from some of Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans in Congress, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\n\u201cAs I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I\u2019ve done before!)\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nTurkey does not appear \u201cas of now\u201d to have begun its expected incursion into northern Syria, a senior Trump administration official said on Monday.\n\nTurkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy said overnight it was Turkey\u2019s fundamental right to take necessary measures for its national security against terrorism threats from Syria.\n\n\u201cTurkey is determined to clear terrorists from the east of the Euphrates and protect its own security and survival while implementing a secure zone in order to achieve peace and stability,\u201d Aksoy said in a written statement.\n\nPresident Tayyip Erdogan has said Turkey plans to resettle two million refugees in northern Syria and Turkish media has said the draft resettlement plan involves a 151 billion lira ($26 billion) construction project. Turkey hosts 3.6 million Syrian refugees.\n\nThe Trump administration official, briefing reporters on a conference call, said 50 U.S. troops in the region that Turkey has targeted would be redeployed elsewhere in Syria \u201cwhere they aren\u2019t in the crossfire.\u201d The United States has about 1,000 troops in Syria.\n\nTurkey\u2019s lira TRYTOM=D3 lost 2% of its value against the dollar to hit its weakest level since early September.
