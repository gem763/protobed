Mandatory Credit: Benny Sieu-USA TODAY Sports\n\nGreen Bay Packers running back Jamaal Williams left the field on a stretcher Thursday night following a helmet-to-helmet hit after the whistle by Philadelphia Eagles defensive end Derek Barnett.\n\nWilliams caught a first-down pass from Aaron Rodgers at the line of scrimmage and, as he turned in the left flat, was corralled immediately for no gain by linebacker Nigel Bradham. As the whistle blew, Barnett charged helmet-first into Williams, who appeared to immediately lose feeling in his arms. Bradham, with one hand on Williams\u2019 facemask, drove Williams into the Lambeau Field turf.\n\nPlayers for both teams stood around a medical team as Williams was loaded to a backboard and secured to a stretcher. He was taken to a local hospital, according to ESPN.\n\nBarnett walked over and appeared to say something to Williams, tapping his left shoulder pad as the Packers\u2019 medical team ushered Barnett out of the way.\n\nWilliams, 24, did motion with his hands to give a thumbs up as he exited through the tunnel. FOX Sports\u2019 Erin Andrews reported during the Packers\u2019 second possession that Williams had movement in his extremities.\n\nA fourth-round pick in 2017 out of BYU, Williams has 26 carries for 87 yards and seven catches for 55 yards in 2019.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Green Bay Packers running back Jamaal Williams left the field on a stretcher Thursday night following a helmet-to-helmet hit after the whistle by Philadelphia Eagles defensive end Derek Barnett.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434429353&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q0DG-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
