Tre Valli Varesine has always been a nice race, but they\u2019ve started playing with the route and that can fool you,\u201d Nibali said afterwards.\n\nThe 34-year-old, winner in 2015 and 2017, will be looking to avoid any slip ups this time in the 243km race from Bergamo to Como, in the north of Italy.\n\nAnother win would see the rider, known as \u2018The Shark\u2019, become the first man to win three titles since Damiano Cunego in 2008. Italian cycling great Fausto Coppi holds the record for five titles between 1946 and 1954.\n\nNibali is one of four former winners in the field along with Ireland\u2019s Dan Martin, winner in 2014, Belgian Philippe Gilbert, 2009 and 2010, and Colombian Esteban Chaves, 2016.\n\nPinot will not defend his crown having not raced since pulling out injured from the Tour de France.", "description": "Milan (AFP) \u2013 Tour de France champion Egan Bernal and Vuelta a Espana winner Primoz Roglic have carried their fine form into this week\u2019s", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/3cad05_tour-de-france-2019-winner-egan-bernal-won-one-day-semi-classic-gran-piemonte-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
