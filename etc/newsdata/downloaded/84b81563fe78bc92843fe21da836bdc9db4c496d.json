This is because investors can enjoy rising current income while anticipating capital appreciation irrespective of market conditions.\n\n\n\nWhile there are several dividend stocks that could provide capital appreciation, honing in on stocks with a history of dividend growth leads to a healthy portfolio.\n\n\n\nWhy?\n\n\n\nStocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future.\n\n\n\nMoreover, a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields. Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.\n\n\n\nAs a result, picking dividend growth stocks appears as a winning strategy when some other parameters are also included.\n\n\n\n5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.\n\n\n\n5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenues.\n\n\n\n5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.\n\n\n\nNext 3-5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company\u2019s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.\n\n\n\nPrice/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.\n\n\n\n52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past year.\n\n\n\nTop Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.\n\n\n\nGrowth Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.\n\n\n\nJust these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to just 15.\n\n\n\nHere are five of the 15 stocks that fit the bill:\n\n\n\nOregon-based Lithia Motors Inc.
