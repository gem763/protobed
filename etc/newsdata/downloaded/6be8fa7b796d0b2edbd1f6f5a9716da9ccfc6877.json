That means you can now request your favorite music or podcasts using Siri voice commands, by preferencing the command with \u201cHey Siri, play\u2026,\u201d followed by the audio you want and concluding the command with \u201con Spotify.\u201d\n\nThe Siri support had been spotted earlier while in beta testing, but the company hadn\u2019t confirmed when it would be publicly available.\n\nAccording to Spotify, the Siri support will also work over Apple AirPods, on CarPlay and via AirPlay on Apple HomePod.\n\nIn addition, the Spotify iOS app update will include support for iPhone\u2019s new data-saver mode, which aids when bandwidth is an issue.\n\nSpotify is also today launching on Apple TV, joining other Spotify apps for TV platforms, including Roku, Android TV, Samsung Tizen and Amazon Fire TV.\n\nThe app updates are still rolling out, so you may need to wait to take advantage of the Apple TV support and other new features.\n\nThe lack of Siri support for Spotify was not the streaming music service\u2019s fault \u2014 it wasn\u2019t until iOS 13 that such support even became an option. With the new mobile operating system launched in September, Apple finally opened up its SiriKit framework to third-party apps, allowing end-users to better control their apps using voice commands. That includes audio playback on music services like Spotify, as well as the ability to like and dislike tracks, skip or go to the next song and get track information.\n\nPandora, Google Maps and Waze were among the first to adopt Siri integration when it became available in iOS 13 \u2014 a clear indication that some of Apple\u2019s chief rivals have been ready and willing to launch Siri support as soon as it was possible.\n\nThough the integration with Siri will be useful for end-users and beneficial to Spotify\u2019s business, it may also weaken the streaming company\u2019s antitrust claims against Apple.\n\nSpotify has long stated that Apple engages in anti-competitive business practices when it comes to its app platform, which is designed to favor its own apps and services, like Apple Music, it says. Among its chief complaints was the inability of third-party apps to work with Siri, which gave Apple\u2019s own apps a favored position. Spotify also strongly believes the 30% revenue share required by the App Store hampers its growth potential.\n\nThe streamer filed an antitrust complaint against Apple in the European Union in March. And now, U.S. lawmakers have reached out to Spotify to request information as a part of an antitrust probe here in the states, reports claim.\n\nDespite its new ability to integrate with Siri in iOS 13, Spotify could argue that it\u2019s still not enough. Users will have to say \u201con Spotify\u201d to take advantage of the new functionality, instead of being able to set their default music app to Spotify, which would be easier. It could also point out that the support is only available to iOS 13 devices, not the entire iOS market.\n\nAlong with the Apple-related news, Spotify today also announced support for Google Nest Home Max, Sonos Move, Sonos One SL, Samsung Galaxy Fold, and preinstallation on Michael Kors Access, Diesel and Emporio Armani Wear OS smartwatches.", "description": "In a long-awaited move, Spotify announced this morning its iOS 13 app would now offer Siri support and its streaming music service would also become available on Apple TV.
