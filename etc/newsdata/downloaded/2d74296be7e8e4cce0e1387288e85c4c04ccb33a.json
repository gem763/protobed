So the club was good enough to put some faith in me and I feel like the last couple of seasons I repaid that one, with what I was able to do on the field and two, what I was able to do off the field in developing some of the younger kids.\n\n\u201cFrom a personal point of view it\u2019s very disappointing but at the same time I fully understand (not being offered a contract).\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been lucky enough to craft out a career that lasted 14 years, so in that sense now reflecting, I\u2019m happy with where it all sits but I thought my footy may have been good enough to keep me going.\u201d", "description": "Dale Thomas hasn\u2019t given up hope of extending his AFL career into next year after receiving some interest from rival clubs.", "authors": ["Kate Salemme"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/6c8d0b2440ca03a04eaa33b03976cc79?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
