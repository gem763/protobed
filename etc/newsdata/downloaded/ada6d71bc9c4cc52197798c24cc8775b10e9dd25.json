(Edrea du Toit, Rapport, file)\n\nThe University of Pretoria has come under fire for displaying a painting by a man jailed for kicking a sex worker to death, with outrage brimming in one of the world's most dangerous countries for women.\n\n\n\nZwelethu Mthethwa's work has been on display at the university's Javett Art Centre since September.\n\nHe was sentenced to 18 years in prison in 2017 for killing 23-year-old Nokuphila Kumalo four years earlier.\n\nREAD: Zwelethu Mthethwa gets 18 years in jail for killing sex worker\n\n\n\nHis 1996 oeuvre, The Wedding Party, shows a new husband being congratulated while his uninterested, passive bride sips a drink.\n\nThe Sex Worker Education and Advocacy Taskforce (SWEAT) said the painting should be removed \"out of respect\" to Kumalo's family and taking into account the \"violence meted out by men to vulnerable and marginalised populations \u2026 in South Africa\".\n\nSouth Africa was plagued by violence against women, with at least 137 sexual offences being committed every day, according to official figures.\n\nIn August alone, more than 30 women were killed by their spouses.\n\nThe university's art centre has defended the curators of the \"All in Day's Eye: The Politics of Innocence\" exhibition, saying Mthethwa's painting was included \"with the sole purpose of presenting it as 'evidence' that highlights how misogyny has played out in his work over time\".\n\nSocial media networks were filled with outrage.\n\n\"We don't need to debate whether violent murderers' work should be exhibited - when conditions continue to support violence against women, transgender people,\" one tweet read.\n\nSWEAT launched an online petition against the painting's display.", "description": "The University of Pretoria has come under fire for displaying a painting by a man jailed for kicking a sex worker to death, with outrage brimming in one of the world's most dangerous countries for women.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/1828/0f1fc12ded8e4aac946c0307148b511d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
