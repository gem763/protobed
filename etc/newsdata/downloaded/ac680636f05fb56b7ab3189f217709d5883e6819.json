That\u2019s why we\u2019re launching Clubcard Plus \u2013 so that they can get better value on the products and services that matter most to them, throughout the whole year.\"\n\nIt said the 10% discount on two big shops alone - to the value of \u00a3200 each every month, could save families \"over \u00a3380 a year\".\n\nMirror Money calculations show that order to break even, you'll need to spend at least \u00a379.90 a month over two shops - or \u00a340 twice a month, every month - to cover the cost of subscription.\n\nAnything more than that and you should be quids in.\n\n\"A family with two young children spend on average \u00a3120 on nappies a month, so can save \u00a312 a month with 10% off Fred & Flo nappies,\" the supermarket said.\n\n\"A family of four with two school aged children spend on average \u00a32002 a year on school uniform so can save \u00a320 a year with 10% off F&F.\n\n(Image: Tesco)\n\n\"If a couple spend \u00a312665 with a credit card with a 2.75% foreign exchange fee, that\u2019s nearly \u00a335 on foreign exchange fees every holiday.\n\n\"If they have a Clubcard Plus Credit Card from Tesco Bank (available from the new year), there are no foreign exchange fees so that\u2019s money towards a nice meal out.\"\n\nNew and existing Tesco Mobile customers will also get double data on a pay monthly contract every month.\n\nShoppers will still be able to get one point for every pound they spend and can continue to redeem them for money-off vouchers to spend either on their groceries or redeem with Tesco\u2019s 150 Clubcard partners.\n\nThe easiest way for customers to access the Clubcard benefits is through the quick and easy to use Tesco Clubcard app.\n\nBut be aware it won't be applicable on lottery tickets, fuel, in branch caf\u00e9s, at tobacco kiosks, gift cards, e-top ups, savings stamps, postage stamps, 10p carrier bags, prescription medicines or infant milk formula.\n\nThe traditional Clubcard will continue to be available to all customers free of charge.\n\nTo subscribe to Clubcard Plus, customers can visit www.tesco.com/clubcard/clubcard-plus from Friday, November 8.", "description": "Ahead of its launch on Friday, November 8, the grocer has outlined the benefits that it believes will justify the annual subscription cost", "authors": ["Emma Munbodh", "Image", "Tesco", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article14748059.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Tesco-reveals-exciting-new-improvements-to-Clubcard.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
