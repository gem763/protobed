In the previous ruling the courts decided that the most serious offence was the alleged criminal association, which was carried out in Genoa.\n\nItaly's top court however accepted the claim from the defendants' lawyers, ruling that the most serious offence was that of money laundering, which was allegedly committed in Milan.\n\nBerneschi was ousted from his job in September 2013 after 20 years as Carige's chairman in a management overhaul imposed by the Bank of Italy following audits that revealed poor lending practices, a large derivatives exposure and questionable accounting methods.\n\nShareholders in Carige approved last month a 700 million euro ($771 million) cash call, relinquishing control of the lender to save it from liquidation after years of losses.\n\n(Reporting by Domenico Lusi, writing by Sabina Suzzi Editing by Keith Weir)", "description": "ROME, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Italy's highest court cancelled a  ruling sentencing Giovanni Berneschi, former chairman of  Genoa-based bank Banca Carige, to eight...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
