Dak Prescott, Ezekiel Elliott, Amari Cooper, and La\u2019el Collins all had their rookie deals expiring over the next couple seasons, and it was (and still is) unclear whether the Dallas Cowboys have enough money to go around.\n\nWhile much of the conversation centered on if they could make the numbers work, the bigger issue for us at PFF was should they make the numbers work? This was an offense that ranked only 19th last season in points per drive. Even after adding Amari Cooper, they were still shut out in a crucial late-season matchup with the Colts.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nWhy get salary-cap strapped to keep together a mediocre offense?\n\nDak Prescott and the Cowboys are 2-0 heading into Week 3's game against the winless Dolphins. (AP)\n\nThrough two weeks of the 2019 season, though, the offense has looked anything but mediocre. The Cowboys currently rank second in points per drive (3.47 after averaging 1.96 in 2018), and the two men who have yet to be extended \u2013 Amari Cooper and Dak Prescott \u2013 have been lights out. With new offensive coordinator Kellen Moore calling plays, the answer to the question of whether they should make the numbers work has been a resounding yes. Let\u2019s look at precisely what changed.\n\nThe tweak in Dallas\u2019 offense\n\nWhile football is often complex, there are simple offensive tenets. Things like passing more often on early downs, using play-action, option football, motion and bunch sets have been proven to be more effective than their counterparts over time. In two of those areas, we\u2019ve seen the Cowboys change drastically from 2018 to this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe first is play-action, where the Dallas offense has been leaving free yards on the table for years. There\u2019s no excuse to have a rushing attack as feared as Dallas\u2019 and only use play-action on 24.9 percent of dropbacks like Prescott did last season (which was 16th-ranked rate among starters).\n\nWe\u2019ve seen the usage of play-action increase league-wide each of the past five seasons, and we haven\u2019t hit the equilibrium point of too much play action. Matt Ryan led the league in its usage his MVP 2016 season, while Jared Goff led in 2017 and 2018.\n\nThrough two games this season, Prescott has used it on 43.1 percent of his dropbacks \u2013 second to only Lamar Jackson among starters. That\u2019s an enormous difference and amounts to nearly another play action pass on one out of every five Prescott dropbacks. Unsurprisingly, Prescott has been torching opponents with it. On his 27 play-action attempts, he has completed 25 passes for 333 yards, four touchdowns and a passer rating of 157.6.\n\nHere's how Pro Football Focus has graded Dak Prescott in his first two games of the season. For more, go to PFF.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore movement, more yards\n\nThe increase in play-action has been an obvious boon for the offense, but a more subtle improvement has come via their added usage of pre-snap motion. Dallas has used motion on 80 of their 137 offensive snaps this season. That\u2019s on pace for 640 such snaps for the season after running only 417 last year. That figure ranks third-most in the NFL, and the only teams that have run more than the Cowboys are the Patriots and Ravens.\n\nIt isn\u2019t a coincidence that those are three of the top four teams in terms of points per drive. Motion often times makes defenses tip their hand pre-snap and, if nothing else, forces them to communicate effectively to adjust to the new formation. It takes little added effort from the offense and is yet another way to pick up free yardage.\n\nAll of these have come together to transform the \u201cstale\u201d Cowboys offense into one of the most exciting in the league. It helps that Prescott is playing the best football of his career, but at the same time, he\u2019s being put in the best situation of his career.\n\nUnfortunately for the Cowboys, though, Prescott\u2019s price tag only skyrockets with each passing game.\n\nFore more analysis, go to PFF.com\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Two big adjustments under the coordination of Kellen Moore has Dak Prescott and the Cowboys' offense soaring.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/dN7PzQnTuFGkKZ.6bSHXAg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05NDIuOTMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/a2xq3gIVugoirBXnRuHd5w--~B/aD00MDQyO3c9NTQ4NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/114c98c0-da42-11e9-bfaf-f92368d12739", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
