How many have a power of attorney document? An advance directive? What about a financial plan?\n\nI expected a weak response to some of these questions, but I was surprised at how few of these educated, professional people had arranged for even the more commonplace documents \u2014 for example, only four of the 18 participants had a financial plan. While I view these tools as vital to guiding my life, it became clear that not everyone sees them as essential.\n\nRecently, DHM Research \u2014 a research firm my company works with \u2014 offered me the opportunity to ask questions in one of their surveys. So I posed the same queries I\u2019d asked the workshop participants, but this time to 625 people in a scientifically conducted online survey. Here\u2019s what I learned:\n\nItem Respondent Has in Place Percentage of Respondents An advanced directive (legal documents that allow you to spell out your decisions about end-of-life care ahead of time) 19% A will (a legal document that coordinates the distribution of your assets after death) 26% Power of attorney (a document that gives on your behalf the authority to act for another person in specified or all legal or financial matters) 15% A financial plan (a comprehensive overview of your financial standing and goals) 30% A life plan (a document that maps out the things you want to achieve in life and when and how you will attain them) 13% None of the above 44% Don\u2019t know 1%\n\nThe survey confirmed what I had glimpsed in the workshop: few people use these tools that are so important for successful lives. As the survey indicated, the most commonly used of these tools is the financial plan \u2014 but in my experience, it can be a difficult to plan for your financial future when you don\u2019t know exactly what you\u2019d like to accomplish.\n\nRead: These 16 money wasters are why so many Americans can\u2019t save for retirement\n\nPlus: 4 secrets to getting what you want out of your life\n\nI experienced this 20 years ago, soon after my wife and I married, when we met with a financial planner for the first time. \u201cWhat do you want to spend money on?\u201d was his very first question. It\u2019s a legitimate question, but it\u2019s one that should come eight- or 10 questions later in the conversation. The questions that might come before the money one would be around our hopes, dreams, and goals. From there, we could zero in on the financial plans necessary to make them happen.\n\nFollowing that thinking, I believe in the importance of an \u201cintentional life plan\u201c to generate a framework for what we\u2019d like to accomplish in our lives. One respondent in another survey put it well: \u201cEven though wealth management professionals routinely create financial plans for their clients, most have never considered creating a life plan for themselves. It\u2019s a new idea \u2026 [but] most people spend more time planning a one-week vacation than identifying what outcomes they want to see in the major areas of their lives.\u201d\n\nThe first step in assembling an intentional life plan is to ask soul-searching questions including: What\u2019s your philosophy? What do you view as your purpose here on earth? What makes you happiest? What do you lack that you think you still need? Where do you want to be five-, 10-, 15-, 20 years from now? What fascinated you as a kid, and what did you dream about being and doing as an adult? What is your definition of a successful life?\n\nNext, determine how many years you will live. According to the Social Security Administration, a woman turning age 65 today can expect to live, on average, until age 86.5; a man until age 84.0 (and more of us are living past 90). There are many excellent life expectancy calculators online. While it can be a bit daunting to contemplate our death date, the reality is that it will happen eventually, so we may as well make the most of the time we have.\n\nNext, you will put together your written intentional life plan timeline, ideally composed of a long sheet of butcher paper, with the current year on the far left and your expected death date on the far right, with every year numbered in between and decades delineated. You can read more about the complete process of putting together the plan here.\n\nThe other instruments highlighted in DHM\u2019s survey \u2013\u2013 wills, power of attorney and advanced directives\u2013 \u2013 also need to be put in place, ensuring that once you\u2019ve lived that intentional life, it can be settled efficiently.\n\nWant to buy a house? Send your child to college? Live in Amsterdam for a year? Not leave your relatives wondering if you\u2019d want life support extended? Making these plans now \u2014 for your intentional life, your financial future and beyond \u2014 will help you accomplish your dreams and ease the burden on your loved ones.\n\nLee Weinstein is president of Weinstein PR and author of \u201c Write, Open, Act: An Intentional Life Planning Workbook .\u201d The DHM Research survey was administered scientifically online to 625 Americans aged 18+ between February 26, 2019, and March 2, 2019.
