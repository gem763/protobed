It is disgraceful that the Coalition and Conservative Governments have failed to right this wrong.\u201d\n\nThe blunder happened when people were put on the wrong system when they moved from the old incapacity benefit to \"contributory\" Employment and Support Allowance (ESA).\n\nThe total bill by March 2025, including ongoing higher payments, is now expected to be \u00a31.18bn - down from a previous estimate of \u00a31.67bn.\n\nAs of October 13, all but 90,000 of the 600,000 cases that need checking have been completed with the final ones due for completion by March.\n\nSome 100,000 people have received back payments totalling \u00a3552m.\n\nDWP officials said: \"There are lower average arrears payments than forecast, smaller than expected changes to the value of ongoing awards, and a smaller number of cases owed arrears.\n\n\"The Department has maintained a thorough process for reviewing cases throughout the exercise to ensure those who have been affected are identified and paid the arrears they are due.\"\n\nThe scandal has been going on for so long that 1 in 12 of all cases to be checked involve people who had already died.\n\nYet only 1,000 of those who died have so far received any back payments for their family.\n\nDWP officials said an unknown number of relatives had not responded to \"multiple attempts\" to contact them by phone or post over 8 weeks.\n\nA DWP spokesman said: \u201cAs our work progresses, we are able to more accurately understand how many people are affected.\n\n\u201cWe are making good progress towards ensuring everyone receives the benefits they are entitled to and no one misses out.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Officials are set to repay 90,000 fewer sick and disabled people than they first thought", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Newscast Online", "Getty Images Eyeem", "Getwestlondon"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article14167754.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JIP_MDG_210319Metalhealth_04682JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
