and urges UK MPs to back it", "language": "en", "text": "European Union leaders endorsed a hard-fought Brexit deal with Britain on Thursday, but Prime Minister Boris Johnson faces an uphill battle getting it through the British parliament.\n\n\u201cIt looks like we are very close to the final stretch,\u201d EU Council President Donald Tusk told reporters after the other 27 leaders approved the accord.\n\nBut despite optimism from Johnson, British opposition parties and some of the prime minister\u2019s own allies in the House of Commons were quick to warn they would not support it when it goes to a vote in a special sitting on Saturday.\n\nIf the deal is defeated, the prime minister is obliged under British law to ask EU leaders to postpone Brexit for a third time \u2014 breaking his vow to lead Britain out on October 31.\n\nTusk said that if his happened he would consult member states on how to respond.\n\nJohnson insisted he was \u201cvery confident\u201d MPs would back the deal, but the immediate response from opposition parties and even his coalition partners was hostile.\n\nAnd Juncker sought to focus MPs\u2019 minds, saying that Brussels can see no need for another delay to the painful divorce.\n\n\u201cWe have a deal, and this deal means there is no need for any kind of prolongation,\u201d he told reporters \u2014 although the decision will be for EU leaders.\n\nAsked whether they had a message for the 48 percent of British voters who backed staying in the EU in the June 2016 Brexit referendum, Juncker simply said: \u201cI would like to say to the 48 that they were right.\u201d\n\nAnd Tusk said: \u201cI regret that it was 48 and not 52.\u201d\n\nBut despite their misgivings, both men argued that the deal would protect the rights of remaining EU citizens and the integrity of the bloc\u2019s single market.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Get Brexit done\u2019 \u2013\n\nJohnson, a leader of the \u201cleave\u201d campaign in 2016 who has vowed to leave the EU at the end of this month come what may, said he had secured a \u201cgreat new deal that takes back control\u201d.\n\nLooking worn and tired after days of intense politicking, Johnson urged MPs \u201cto come together to get Brexit done, to get this excellent deal over the line and to deliver Brexit without any more delay.\u201d\n\nThe compromise reached on Thursday is a personal victory for Johnson, who was told repeatedly by EU leaders that they were not open to reworking a deal initially inked last year.\n\nBut there were immediate signs the Commons \u2014 which rejected the previous divorce text three times \u2014 might again refuse to play ball.\n\nNorthern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which props up Johnson\u2019s Conservatives, said it was \u201cunable to support these proposals\u201d.\n\nThe main opposition Labour, Scottish National and Liberal Democrat parties also spoke out against it.\n\nTheir response sent the pound sinking again after it had earlier risen to five-month peaks on news of the deal.\n\n\u2013 \u2018No Irish border\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe draft agreement was forged after weeks of tense negotiations focused on altering arrangements to keep open the border between British Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland.\n\nAll sides agree they do not want infrastructure on the frontier, to avoid exacerbating tensions over Britain\u2019s control of Northern Ireland that caused decades of deadly violence up until the 1990s.\n\nThe new plan keeps the United Kingdom as a single customs territory, allowing it to strike international trade deals, but requiring London to levy EU tariffs on certain goods passing through Northern Ireland.\n\nNorthern Ireland would also follow the EU\u2019s rules on agricultural, food and industrial goods.\n\n\u201cThere will be no border on the island of Ireland and the (EU\u2019s) single market will be protected,\u201d Juncker said.\n\nBut it would involve some customs and tax checks between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain, and the DUP warned the plans \u201cundermine the integrity of the union\u201d.\n\nNorthern Ireland\u2019s regional assembly will be given a vote every four years on whether to maintain the arrangements, but the DUP warned that did not go far enough.\n\n\u2013 Referendum call \u2013\n\nJohnson has assured his European counterparts that he can get the deal through parliament, and French President Emmanuel Macron said he was \u201creasonably confident\u201d the deal could be ratified.\n\nA European official who was present when Johnson briefed the leaders said that around six of them asked questions, and all of them were about his domestic political situation.\n\nBut Johnson has no majority among MPs, and his threat to leave the EU with or without a deal this month has exacerbated existing divisions in parliament.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "European Union leaders endorsed a hard-fought Brexit deal with Britain, but Boris
