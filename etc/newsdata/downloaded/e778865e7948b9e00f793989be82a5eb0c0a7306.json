In its Face ID support page, the company suggests you use your passcode to unlock an iPhone if you don't want to risk a twin or sibling that looks like you unlocking your phone.\n\nBut Face ID has a feature called \"Attention Aware\" that prevent iPhones from being unlocked when your eyes are closed. It's more secure, but it makes the iPhone harder to unlock using Face ID. IPhone users can disable \"Attention Aware\" to make Face ID unlocking faster and easier, but also less secure. The point is that \"Attention Aware\" is turned on by default, while the Pixel 4 doesn't even currently have the option.\n\nBusiness Insider asked Google whether the Pixel 4 will eventually get a feature that prevents unlocking the phone when your eyes are closed. A Google spokesperson said \"like most of our products, this feature is designed to get better over time with future software updates.\"\n\nThe Google spokesperson also told Business Insider that \"Pixel 4 face unlock meets the security requirements as a strong biometric, and can be used for payments and app authentication, including banking apps. It is resilient against unlock attempts via other means, like with masks.\"\n\nStill, if you're really worried about security on the Pixel 4, or any phone for that matter, nothing seems to beat the good old-fashioned PIN or passcode.", "description": "The new Google Pixel 4's facial recognition might be able to be fooled by someone who looks a lot like you.", "authors": ["Antonio Villas-Boas"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da87f9f4af9092fc0221fe3?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
