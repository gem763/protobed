When it's warm, I'm a lion. We adjust for every condition there is.\"\n\n(Image: USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe 38-year-old is bidding to win his first trophy with the club since joining them two-and-a-half seasons ago.\n\nGalaxy have not won the title themselves since 2014, and will rest heavily on their prolific marksman.\n\nIbrahimovic has been deadly in front of goal in the States, scoring 52 goals in 56 league games for his club.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nHis form has made him ever more popular among supporters, with his jersey the best-selling shirt with fans in the MLS.\n\nA win against Minnesota could see the Galaxy rewarded with an all-Los Angeles derby with LAFC.\n\nFormer Arsenal striker Carlos Vela lines up for the opposition, and pipped Ibrahimovic to the golden boot by just four goals - although played two games more.\n\nIbrahimovic made it clear he felt with more games it would be a different story, but stated previously that team success outweighed his pursuit of individual honours.\n\n\"I prefer the collective victory; it's more important,\" Ibrahimovic said. \"With collective success, individual success comes.\n\n\"If I can do good for my team, I know I am doing well, I am not focusing on personal achievements. Without my teammates, those things would not be possible.\"", "description": "The Swedish striker is bidding to win his first trophy in the States after an impressive season in front of goal", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Image", "Usa Today Sports", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20637742.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_MLS-Sporting-Kansas-City-at-LA-Galaxy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
