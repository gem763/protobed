During this course, it has collected a ton of photographs and data on the moon\u2018s surface.\n\nThat data is now available for visual artists in the form of a 3D map with depth information. The space agency released the map in September, but, was highlighted by TechCrunch last Saturday.\n\nLRO uses two main instruments to capture surface data of the moon: a multispectral camera and a laser altimeter. The camera captures images of different parts of the moon based on its position in the oribit, and the altimeter captures the topology of the surface.\n\nErnie Wright, a science visualizer, working at NASA has created this model from data provided by LRO. The map is in the form of a displacement map that uses different colors to denote topology instead of height.\n\nYou can access the moon kit from here.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ivan Mehta"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FNASA-moon.png&signature=f889c9a706d51c701702731e1c1b8298", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
