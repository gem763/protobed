While running for president, he referred to transgender people as \u201cabnormal\" and said they should not be in the military. As HUD Secretary, he weakened Obama-era protections for transgender people, saying he believes in equal rights, not \u201cspecial rights.\u201d\n\nIn May, the agency introduced a proposal that would allow federally funded shelters to deny people admission on religious grounds or force transgender women to share bathrooms and sleeping quarters with men.\n\nCarson has addressed the proposed change using different terms in public, most notably during Congressional hearings, when he has said his responsibility is to \u201cmake sure everybody is treated fairly. \u201d\n\nBut he has repeatedly mocked transgender people in internal meetings in Washington, according to a government official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations in which the person was involved.\n\n\"His overall tone is dismissive and joking about these people,\" the official said. \"It's disrespectful of the people we are trying to serve.\"\n\nBen Carson\u2019s HUD dials back investigations into housing discrimination\n\nAsked to respond to the detailed accounts of Carson\u2019s language in San Francisco and Washington, a HUD senior official released a statement that said: \u201cThe Secretary does not use derogatory language to refer to transgendered individuals. Any reporting to the contrary is false.\"\n\nThe official, who did not want to be named because he was not present during the meetings, said Carson was referring to men who pretend to be women to gain access to battered women\u2019s shelters -- and not singling out transgender women as \u201cbig, hairy men.\u201d\n\nTold of HUD\u2019s response, employees who were at the meeting said that was not clear from Carson\u2019s remarks.\n\nTransgender advocates called HUD\u2019s defense of Carson a common, damaging and insulting trope that had long been debunked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gravely insulting to have the specter of violence from cis gender men used to restrict the rights of transgender people who are ordinarily the victims of that violence,\u201d said Gillian Branstetter, spokeswoman for the National Center for Transgender Equality.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mythical notion that policies that are inclusive of transgender people somehow pose a threat,\" she said. \"It\u2019s frankly despicable that such a harmful notion would be used by someone charged with facilitating programs meant to help people in need, many of whom are transgender.\u201d\n\nNew legal protections for transgender people do not increase the number of crimes in restrooms, locker rooms, or dressing rooms, and reports of privacy and safety violations are \u201cexceedingly rare,\u201d according to a study published in the March 2019 issue of Sexuality Research and Social Policy.\n\nCarson appeared in San Francisco as part of a large scale effort by the Trump administration to address homelessness in California. Carson\u2019s comments in San Francisco were unprompted, the staffers said, arriving during a rambling hour-long speech about HUD initiatives that they described as \u201cstream of consciousness.\u201d\n\nAll three HUD employees in San Francisco, contacted and interviewed separately by The Washington Post, spoke on the condition of anonymity because they said they feared retaliation. They said Carson prefaced his remarks about transgender people by saying he believed in fairness and equality, but not \u201cspecial rights\u201d for any class of people.\n\nCarson said that \"transgender people should get the same rights as everyone else, but they don\u2019t get to change things for everybody else,\u201d according to one staffer who took notes during the meeting.\n\nCarson followed by recounting conversations with shelter operators and women\u2019s groups who told him that homeless women would be traumatized if \u201cbig, hairy men\u201d walk into shelters identifying as women, according to the HUD staffers. Carson told the group single-sex shelters should have the discretion to turn away transgender people.\n\n\u201cThat was the first time any of us heard him use such derogatory language,\u201d one San Francisco staffer said. \u201cHe\u2019s more tactful when he\u2019s talking before Congress, whereas this sounded like a slur to me.\u201d\n\nAnother staffer said: \u201cThe sentiment conveyed was these were not women, and they should not be housed in single-sex shelters -- like we shouldn\u2019t force people to accept transgender people in this context because it makes other people uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nCarson\u2019s talk became even more disturbing, two of the staffers said, when he started waxing nostalgic about the past when, in the words of one staffer, there were \u201cjust women and just men.\u201d The HUD staffers said he sounded incredulous when he mentioned that people no longer know the difference between genders.\n\n\u201cHis tone was kind of like \u2018how crazy is that?\u2019\u201d another staffer said.\n\nProposed HUD rule would strip transgender protections at homeless shelters\n\nOne woman drew applause from her colleagues when she stood up and refuted Carson\u2019s statement that gender definitions have been static for thousands for years, the employees said. The woman asked Carson to reconsider his position. He politely thanked her for her comment and moved on.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty demoralizing and mortifying for many of us who work here and are about serving everybody,\u201d a staffer said. \u201cA lot of us have questioned the department\u2019s rationale on its proposal to strip away the equal access rule. For him to come to San Francisco and say this, it was unbelievable. People were just shell-shocked.\"\n\nThe employees said that Carson acknowledged that the transgender community does not regard him as a friend. Transgender advocates such as the National Center for Transgender Equality have accused Carson of initiating changes that seek to \u201cerase transgender people from federal regulations and legal interpretations.\"\n\nIn early 2017, shortly after Carson took charge of the agency, the HUD website removed links to documents that guided emergency shelters on how best to comply with agency regulations and serve transgender people facing homelessness. It also withdrew proposals that would have required HUD-funded emergency shelters to post notices informing people of LGTBQ rights and protections.\n\nCarson told the House Financial Services Committee in May that those notices were unnecessary because the Equal Access Rule provisions already \u201cadequately provide for fairness for all communities.\u201d He said he wanted to allow for more \u201clocal jurisdictional control\u201d over how to treat people.\n\n\u201cIf you want to do something different about the definition of gender, that is a congressional duty,\" Carson told members of Congress in response to a question about whether LGBTQ people should be protected under fair housing and other civil rights laws.\n\nCarson also erroneously assured the committee that HUD had no plans to eliminate the 2012 Equal Access Rule, which barred federal housing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. A day later, HUD proposed its new rule allowing federally funded shelters to turn away transgender people on religious grounds.\n\nOne in three transgender people have experienced homelessness \u2014 including one in eight in the last year alone, putting them at risk of physical and sexual violence and being forced into sex work, according to the National Center for Transgender Equality.\n\nIn remarks during his Senate confirmation hearing in January 2017, Carson told Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) that he would enforce laws related to equal access to housing for gay, lesbian, and transgender people, but added: \u201cWhat I have mentioned in the past is the fact that no one gets extra rights. Extra rights means, you get to redefine everything for everybody else.\u201d\n\nBen Carson\u2019s HUD: Political loyalty required, no experience necessary\n\nBefore his time at HUD, Carson characterized the debate over transgender students accessing the bathrooms that match their identity as an \u201cabnormal situation.\u201d He also expressed his opposition to gay marriage.\n\n\u201cBoys who say, 'I feel like a girl today, I want to go into the girl\u2019s lavatory -- that is such a bunch of garbage. If we continue to cater to that, where will it lead? Where will it lead us to be?\u201d Carson said in an interview with the Eternal Word Television Network, a Catholic TV program, posted in 2016 while he was running for president. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s beyond ridiculous that you take the most abnormal situation and then you make everyone else conform to it ... when we start trying to impose the extra rights based on a few people who perhaps are abnormal, where does that lead?\u201d\n\nCarson has also expressed objections to transgender people in the military, saying while campaigning in Iowa in December 2015: \u201cI do not appreciate using our military as a laboratory for social experimentation,\u201d according to BuzzFeed News. \u201cThe last thing we need to be doing is saying, \u2018What would it be like if we introduced several transgender people into this platoon?\u2019 Give me a break. Deal with the transgender thing somewhere else.\u201d", "description": "During his visit to San Francisco this week, the Housing and Urban Development Secretary also lamented that society no longer seemed to know the difference between men and women, according to three people who were present. Carson\u2019s remarks, which visibly shocked people at the gathering, are part of a pattern of making dismissive remarks about transgender people. Under his leadership, HUD has moved to weaken Obama-era rules requiring shelters house transgender people with their identified gender.", "authors": ["Tracy Jan", "Reporter Covering The Intersection Of Race", "The Economy", "Jeff Stein", "Economic Policy Reporter"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4XD6NOG2MAI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
