After Arthur left the family four years later, Bell was raised by his mother and stepfather, a future Conservative mayor of Marylebone.\n\nAfter leaving Queen Elizabeth Grammar School at the age of 17, Bell began his working life in the post room of ABC Television. Over the next decade, he worked for a number of advertising companies before joining the newly founded firm of Saatchi & Saatchi at the age of 29, where he rose to the position of managing director.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

(She seems not to have been perturbed by his 1977 conviction, when he was fined \u00a350 after masturbating in front of a bathroom window overlooking Hampstead Heath and exposing himself to passers-by).\n\nThe advertising campaign that was delivered \u2013 devised by Jeremy Sinclair and sold to Thatcher by Bell \u2013 centred around an image of a snaking dole queue beneath the slogan \u201cLabour isn\u2019t working\u201d, and was credited by some in the Conservative Party with winning them a majority in 1979. It was later voted the \u201cPoster of the Century\u201d by trade magazine Campaign.\n\nThatcher and Bell, who had first met while canvassing for the Conservatives during the 1960s, began a long and fruitful partnership. Bell returned for the successful election campaigns of 1983 and 1987, even advising Thatcher on her dress and hairstyle, and in return he was frequently invited to spend Christmas with the Thatchers at Chequers, and knighted in 1991; a peerage was conferred in 1998. When Thatcher died in 2013, it was Bell who was tasked with breaking the news to the media.\n\nIn 1985, Bell switched his primary focus from advertising to PR, founding Lowe Bell, which would later become Bell Pottinger when co-founder Frank Lowe demanded that his name be removed.\n\nBell Pottinger\u2019s work made Bell\u2019s lasting reputation, for better or worse. While he protested that he would have been unwilling to represent an Adolf Hitler or a Saddam Hussein, his clientele \u2013 taking in the Chilean despot Augusto Pinochet, the Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko, and various others accused of brutal human rights abuses \u2013 suggested the existence of a lesser class of tyrant that Bell was happy to indulge.\n\nRather incredibly, he once claimed that he only took their money because \u201cthey promised me they were going to stop being evil\u201d, and washed his hands when, one after the other, each one failed to change his life\u2019s course. Bell\u2019s true feelings might be better illustrated by his comments to The New York Times late in life, wherein he cast morality not as an essential manifestation of humanity, but as a \u201cjob\u201d more suited to the priesthood than his own industry.\n\nIn 2016 Bell resigned his post at Bell Pottinger amid scandal and acrimony. The firm had been taken on by the Gupta brothers, a pair of Indian billionaires with links to South African president Jacob Zuma. That year South Africa\u2019s former public protector Thuli Madonsela released a report claiming extensive corruption involving the Guptas, and accusing Bell Pottinger of engaging in a \u201chateful and divisive campaign to divide South Africa along the lines of race\u201d, launching the country into a political scandal.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Bell Pottinger roundly rejected that version of events.\n\nThe company\u2019s demise was ultimately precipitated by a disastrous interview given by Bell to Kirsty Wark on the BBC\u2019s Newsnight after his resignation. As Bell attempted to distance himself from the Gupta affair, Wark refuted each claim by quoting emails sent by Bell himself, all while his telephone rang off repeatedly in the background. The surprising incompetence on display led many to wonder if this was a deliberate act of sabotage \u2013 Bell\u2019s parting shot to his former colleagues.\n\nWhether that was to credit an improbable intelligence to Bell \u2013 who had himself declared that his only truly remarkable talent was his charm, and whose sharpness may simply have been dulled by illness and age \u2013 it fed into the legend of the Machiavellian puppet-master, always one step ahead of the game.\n\nHe is survived by his third wife, Lady Jackie, and two children from his second marriage.\n\nTim Bell, Baron Bell, advertising and PR consultant, born 18 October 1941, died 25 August 2019", "description": "Tim Bell, who has died aged 77, was an advertising and public relations executive who famously acted as Margaret Thatcher\u2019s spin doctor for a period spanning three successful general elections, and was later prominently involved in reputation management for a litany of highly controversial regimes and individuals.", "authors": ["James Williams"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/17/13/Tim-Bell.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
