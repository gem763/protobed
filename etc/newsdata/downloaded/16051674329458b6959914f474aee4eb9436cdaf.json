Chris Chinn estimates that the equivalent of 63,000 punnets of blueberries will be left to wither, or be eaten by birds.\n\nMeanwhile, in Sussex, 150 tonnes of lettuce have had to remain uncut in the past few weeks and during the summer eight tonnes of Class One Scottish strawberries went unpicked. Pictured: Family-owned fruit farm Cobrey Farms in Herefordshire\n\nEnough French beans to fill 5,500 packs will mulch into the soil. The loss of revenue will run into tens of thousands of pounds.\n\n'If we had enough workers to pick all our fruit, you would have found our blueberries in Monmouth M&S, not Peruvian ones, because we supply the company and they are generally very supportive of British suppliers,' the 38-year-old farmer told me worriedly.\n\n'As long as the quality is good and the quantity is there, they will usually take our produce first.'\n\nThis autumn, however, the dearth of pickers means the quantity is not there \u2014 and the depressing scene at Cobrey Farm is being mirrored across the country.\n\nThe great British apple is our national fruit, and there is no taste quite as autumnal as that of a crunchy Cox's Orange Pippin or tangy Gala.\n\nEnough French beans (pictured) to fill 5,500 packs will mulch into the soil. The loss of revenue will run into tens of thousands of pounds\n\nYet, according to the National Farmers' Union, 16 million \u2014 yes 16 million \u2014 of our apples will rot in the orchards this year because there are not enough workers to gather them. That is enough fruit to provide 44,000 children with their proverbial 'apple a day' for a year.\n\nMeanwhile, in Sussex, 150 tonnes of lettuce have had to remain uncut in the past few weeks; during the summer eight tonnes of Class One Scottish strawberries went unpicked; and at Haygrove, a major soft-fruit farm near Ledbury, Herefordshire, 87,000 punnets of raspberries have just been written off through lack of manpower.\n\nPerhaps because we cannot see a dramatic visual image of this appalling wastage \u2014 there is no colossal mountain of rotting fruit and vegetables \u2014 this story has been under-reported.\n\nYet Ali Capper, chairman of the NFU's Horticulture and Potato Board, told me the labour shortage was now a full-blown 'crisis'.\n\nIf it is not addressed soon, she fears, the British horticultural industry could shrink significantly, leaving shoppers ever more reliant on imported fruit and veg, which can be about 30 per cent more expensive than home-grown.\n\nShe said she already knew of two producers who are considering burning the plants for next year's crop now, rather than going to the expense of growing them \u2014 only to find they can't be harvested.\n\nOther British producers talk of relocating to Portugal and even Senegal.\n\nAnd all this at a time when the demand for locally produced food has never been greater, not only because it is fresher and boosts our economy, but because millions of environmentally conscious Britons want to cut down on the air miles for imports.\n\nBuying British blueberries, as opposed to those grown on huge industrial farms in Peru, and freighted here by air or sea, is one obvious way we can help.\n\nIndeed, according to Chris Chinn, for every kilogram of home-grown fruit and veg they buy, consumers save 10kg of carbon emissions.\n\nBut what has caused the acute shortage of seasonal pickers, and what can be done about it?\n\nWhile some Remainers have sought to make political capital out of this issue because it involves Eastern European workers, the essential causes of the problem are not down to Brexit.\n\nAs several farmers put it to me, the imbroglio over the EU is just 'a distraction'. We will come back to this in a moment. But first, some history.\n\nIn bygone decades, the nation's farmers were reliant on a 'housewives army' of pickers: local women who would toil in the fields at harvest time for a few pounds, paid cash-in-hand.\n\nEvoking a scene from the H.E. Bates novel The Darling Buds Of May, Mr Chinn's father, John, 67, recalled the days when he recruited women from towns and villages in the Forest of Dean.\n\n'We'd send a ten-tonne stock-lorry around the estates, and they'd clamber in the back and spend the day working in the fields. Some would bring their babies in prams, leaving them beside the fields, and older children might play in the hills,' he smiled.\n\n'It was hard, physical work but they wanted the money, so they were prepared to do it.'\n\nThese local women were augmented by travellers and backpackers, often from Australia and New Zealand. Casual workers also came from Africa and poorer European countries.\n\nThe overseas pickers were permitted to work temporarily in Britain under the Seasonal Agricultural Workers' Scheme (SAWS), which was passed after World War II amid determined efforts to increase food production, and ran from 1949 to 2013.\n\nBy the early 2000s, however, casual farm labour had changed radically. As one Romanian farmworker told me last week, pickers can walk 20km in an eight-hour shift, after which their backs ache from constant stooping.\n\nTo do such work, you need to be young, fit and mentally tough, and, as Chris Chinn saw several years ago, when Cobrey Farm tried to recruit workers from areas of high unemployment in the North of England, the younger generation of Britons no longer has the stomach for it.\n\nOnly 15 people would even try their hand at fruit-and-veg picking, he says, and although they were broken in gently, within a fortnight they had all returned home.\n\nAlthough 1.3 million people in Britain are officially out of work, and a recent study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development suggested the true figure could be more than three times higher, the welfare benefits system may also deter people from taking seasonal work, he suggests.\n\n'I don't want to accuse them of being a generation of lazy people. I don't think that's true. [But] if you are in a settled situation, you are probably not going to risk losing your benefits for a couple of weeks on an asparagus farm.'\n\nHowever, Eastern Europeans had a very different mind-set. Desperate to escape low-paid jobs and better themselves and their families, they were perfectly prepared to slog all day, in wind and rain and cloying mud.\n\nWhen they gained freedom of movement through EU membership, they came in their thousands, first from Poland and the Czech Republic, and later from Romania and Bulgaria.\n\nThe latter two countries now supply 95 per cent of Cobrey Farm's casual labour-force, which peaks at 1,000 in summer. Though the work is long and tiring, they are paid \u00a38.21 an hour and can earn between \u00a3300 and \u00a3500 a week with bonuses and overtime.\n\nThey also appear well cared for. They pay \u00a352.85 a week for on-site lodging in mobile homes, have use of a new social centre with games, computers, free wifi and a canteen serving Eastern European food.\n\nFour welfare officers are employed to handle their daily concerns. Unfortunately, however, for many Romanians and Bulgarians, these perks are no longer proving sufficiently attractive to lure them away for several months of the year.\n\nThere are several reasons for this, and they vary depending on who you speak to. Alexandru Barbacaru is director of Bucharest-based Est-Vest Services, an employment agency which supplies British farms with temporary workers.\n\nThree years ago, it filled 5,000 vacancies, he says. This year, despite an advertising blitz, finding 3,000 willing pickers would be 'an amazing result'.\n\nThe main reason, he says, is Romania's recent economic boom, which has seen job vacancies soar and the average wage rise by 9.4 per cent. Until recently, a Romanian doctor could earn four times more picking fruit in Britain than practising medicine, but the gap has narrowed considerably.\n\nThe fall in the value of the pound \u2014 largely caused by uncertainty over Brexit \u2014 is another important factor. Romanians still willing to travel abroad for work increasingly prefer other European countries, particularly Germany, which has introduced incentives such as tax-breaks to entice Eastern European farm labourers.\n\nAccording to Adrian Apostol, who first came to Cobrey Farm eight years ago and has worked his way up to a permanent supervisory job, Brexit-related uncertainty over the future status of Europeans in Britain has also discouraged some pickers from coming this year, and persuaded others to leave the country early.\n\n'It is just the confusion that is scaring them away,' he says. 'But once this is sorted, whether there is a deal or not, I think they will feel settled and start to come back.'\n\nPerhaps so. Yet our arable farms need 70,000 overseas casual workers each year to maintain full productivity, and given the improving fortunes of citizens in EU nations such as Romania, they are highly unlikely to come here in such great numbers ever again. What, then, can be done?\n\nThe farm lobby says the next influx of pickers will have to come from outside the EU, from huge countries where low wages and unemployment remain a problem. Places such as Ukraine \u2014 which already sends tens of thousands of seasonal farm-workers to Germany \u2014 and Russia.\n\nTo allow them to gain temporary work visas, the Government would need to reinstate the Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme \u2014 axed, many will say with ill-thought haste, in 2013, by then Home Secretary Theresa May.\n\nCritics claim this was done to show she was tough on immigration \u2014 apparently ignoring the fact that seasonal workers stay in Britain for only a few months (during which they pay taxes and National Insurance) and do not even count towards the Government's own migration figures.\n\nShe also ignored a report, that same year, by the Government's Migration Advisory Committee, warning that the scheme's success was 'a well-functioning model' and should 'not be underestimated'.\n\nFurthermore, an opinion poll conducted for British Summer Fruits, which represents fruit farmers, shows that even among Leave voters, 61 per cent believe a post-Brexit visa scheme should be introduced to allow seasonal employees to come to Britain to fill jobs such as crop-picking.\n\nPerhaps because the immigration debate remains so sensitive, ministers' response has been timorous.\n\nEarlier this year, they announced a tentative reintroduction of the Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme, but only under a two-year pilot scheme allowing farms to employ 2,500 non-EU workers.\n\nIt has led to the arrival of 1,250 students from university agriculture courses in Russia, Moldova and Ukraine, to be followed by others, from Georgia, Belarus and Barbados. However, the farmers I spoke to dismiss this gesture as a 'drop in the ocean'.\n\nThey are demanding that the Government grants immediate entry to the 70,000 workers they need so as to compete with the multinational farming giants that have colonised great swathes of South America and Africa, and are intent on flooding Britain's supermarkets.\n\nI asked the Government what action was being taken to offset the dearth of pickers. A spokesman said the international post-Brexit overhaul of the immigration system would benefit everyone in Britain, including farmers.\n\nAn M&S spokesman said: 'We have proudly stocked British blueberries across our stores throughout the season.\n\n'As the British blueberry season comes to a close we have started to transition to southern hemisphere blueberries, including Peruvian, to ensure the best quality.'\n\nPerhaps so, but the blueberries I sampled at Cobrey Farm certainly tasted 'best quality'; I thought they were sweeter, through slightly smaller, than the ones I bought at the Monmouth M&S.\n\nMeanwhile, the check-out assistant in Monmouth M&S had strong views on why local people couldn't be persuaded off welfare to work in local fields.\n\n'Just look at all those people on the dole,' she said indignantly, when I mentioned that I could only find Peruvian blueberries in the store, despite their abundance nearby. 'It's all wrong. Why don't they go out and pick them?'\n\nAs Britain's farmers count the cost of this bitter autumn harvest and fret over how they'll survive without the help of the deserting Romanians and Bulgarians, many might ask the same question.", "description": "DAVID JONES: According to the National Farmers' Union, 16 million - yes 16 million - of our apples will rot in the orchards this year because there are not enough workers to gather them.", "authors": ["David Jones For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/23/19968654-0-image-a-71_1571611382596.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
