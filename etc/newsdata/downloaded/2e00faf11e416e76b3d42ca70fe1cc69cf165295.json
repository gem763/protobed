She left so soon and she was too young.\"\n\n\"She was such a beautiful person. She was nice, she was friendly. She would always smile, and she would help everybody that she had around her,\" she added. \"We would always have good times and she had so many friends and I just can't think of anybody who she wouldn't get along with.\"\n\nCourtesy Rosie Granados\n\nLeilah Hernandez\n\nThe Odessa government did not release the name of the 15-year-old girl killed, but according to The Associated Press, she was Leilah Hernandez, who had just celebrated her quincea\u00f1era three months ago. She was shot in the parking lot of a car dealership.\n\nSue Ogrocki/AP\n\nEdwin Peregrino\n\nEdwin Peregrino, 25, was shot in his parents' front yard as the suspect drove by, according to the AP.\n\nJoe Griffith\n\nJoe Griffith, 40, of Odessa, was shot dead while sitting at a traffic light with his wife and two children, his sister told The Washington Post.\n\nRodolfo Julio Arco, 57, of Odessa\n\nKameron Karltess Brown, 30\n\nBrownwood Raul Garcia, 35, of El Paso\n\nCallaghan Ohare/Reuters\n\n'We're going to be here'\n\nDdessa Mayor David Turner at a vigil Sunday evening vowed \"to be here\" for his community\n\n\"We're a very friendly community, we're also a very tight community, because being an oil field you see the ups, you see the downs and so you have to be close,\" Turner said. \"And I believe that's going to get us through, fortunately. We are going to have to mourn for a week or so, and then we're going to have to continue to love on those individuals to make sure they realize they have people that care.\"\n\nThe Collinsworth family was one of many who had turned out for the vigil.\n\n\"When it happened, like in El Paso, Ohio and other communities, you feel for them, you pray for them, but when it hits home, it hits home,\" Cindy Collinsworth, of Odessa, told ABC News.\n\n\"I'm writing 'Love not hate,' because I feel like all of this is kind of reckless, what that guy did,\" said her daughter Kahlen Collinsworth. \"I was worried for all my friends, and everybody else that was involved with it.\"\n\n\"From the very core of my being I am sorry,\" Turner said of those in his community dealing with the trauma. \"You're not by yourself on an island; you have a community that cares. We're going to be here. We've already had people step up, pay for the funerals for these individuals. ... The outpouring from the state of Texas has been amazing. In Texas, we always call it the greatest state. It's not the state, it's the people, and people are coming together and offering resources. But really the thing we covet most is prayer.\"\n\nSue Ogrocki/AP\n\nTurner took issue with making gun control the focal point of the conversation, though.\n\n\"The guns are a small part of it. The biggest problem we see are the hearts of individuals,\" he said. \"This problem needs to address mental illness; it also needs to address violence in movies, violence in video games. Video games now are more violent than any movies we saw when I was a kid. But you're seeing younger and younger people step into this violence. And so I think this is a broader issue than just gun control.\"\n\n\"I don't care what the reason is -- he shot people from my city,\" he continued. \"I'm going to take care of this city right now. The politics I don't care about. I need to love on these people.\"\n\nPolice named the suspect as Seth Aaron Ator, 36, of Odessa, who began his shooting spree after getting pulled over for a minor traffic violation.\n\nABC News' Armando Garcia, Cassidy Gard, Adam Kelsey and Marilyn Heck contributed to this report.", "description": "Seven people were killed in the shootings in western Texas.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/mary-granados-odessa2-ugc-mo-20190901_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
