According to one legend, Lord Krishna visited his sister, Subhadra after killing demon Narkasur. Her sister gave a warm welcome to him and made the occasion really special through flowers and sweets. Subhadra also applied the ceremonial \"tilak\" on the forehead of her brother, Krishna and hence the festival of \"Bhai Dooj\" was born from there.\n\nThere are a lot more mythological stories based on the origin of Bhai Dooj. No matter, how many stories are there the only thing is that the festival is all about sibling love.\n\nThey might irritate you, fight with you and not obey you, but they are the purest form of love! They might mock you, but they will never judge you, and will always have your back in whatever you do. That ways siblings are the best!", "description": "Diwali is a festival of lights and is celebrated with lots of happiness.
