Open midday til 11pm \u2013 see you there.\n\nHere\u2019s three we will be targeting\u2026\n\n1 The UK\u2019s favourite cocktail \u2013 the Pornstar Martini \u2013 with a twist\n\nIt\u2019s true \u2013 the PSM was recently voted Britain\u2019s most beloved cocktail, ahead of the mojito (in 2nd place), the espresso martini (in 7th) and the classic martini (in 8th). There were some surprise entries on there \u2013 Sex On The Beach and Woo Woo, which made us feel like it was 1994 all over again \u2013 but today, it\u2019s about the Pornstar.\n\nPornstar martinis at London Cocktail Week\n\nPassoa \u2013 the passionfruit part of the Pornstar Martini \u2013 have a pop-up stand at the Brick Lane cocktail village where they will be serving Pornstars with a twist, using the familiar recipe we all know and love but throwing a few curve balls in there just for fun.\n\n2 A non-alcoholic Negroni\n\nBecause it\u2019s cool not to drink alcohol now, don\u2019t you know. Find a non-alcoholic Negroni at the Nogroni bar (see what they did there) in the cocktail village made with Seedlip, the very lovely if eye-wateringly expensive (when you\u2019re as addicted as we are) alcohol-free botanical drink, mixed with alcohol-free/NA (non-alcoholic) aperitifs by Seedlip\u2019s sister company \u00c6corn aperitifs.\n\nPerfect if you\u2019re AF but fancy a night out or for a break between the hard versions elsewhere.\n\n3 Glenlivet\u2019s scotch pods\n\nRemember the Tide pod debacle? Kids were scoffing tide pods, thinking it was a fun dare, then getting really sick.\n\nNow Glenlivet have released scotch pods \u2013 literally little squishy pods of scotch \u2013 especially for LCW and some have got their knickers in a twist, saying it\u2019s irresponsible to serve consumables in the same form as detergent. Well, many dodgy substances come in bottles too and we manage to tell the difference. Let the fun police step aside and let us at the Glenlivet stall before someone changes their mind and Glenlivet bottle it, literally.", "description": "The Cocktail Village at London Cocktail WeekLondon Cocktail Week wraps up today - that means there are hundreds of bars serving hundreds of cocktails we are dying to try...", "authors": ["Bar Fox"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/9D2A6070-1973-47F1-8006-546971CA5D28-008f_1570956585.jpeg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
