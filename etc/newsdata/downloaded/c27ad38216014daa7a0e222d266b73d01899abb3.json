It largely relied on Mr Modi's policy of muscular nationalism and local issues were less talked about in its campaigns.\n\nMaharashtra witnessed aggressive campaigning by the prime minister and several federal ministers. Its ally Shiv Sena also held rallies across the state.\n\nHaryana, which borders the Indian capital, Delhi, also witnessed rallies and aggressive campaigning by the BJP.\n\nNevertheless, the Congress party is projected to increase its vote share in Haryana, upsetting the BJP's mission of retaining power. Several BJP ministers are trailing.\n\nThe BJP is still projected to be the single-largest party, but it will need support from the regional Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) to form a government.\n\nIt's not clear whether the JJP will support the Congress or the BJP.", "description": "The party is set to retain power in Maharashtra state, but may fall short of a majority in Haryana.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/16AB5/production/_109335829_df58e5f0-e115-4ece-b48e-bcd59624b6b3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
