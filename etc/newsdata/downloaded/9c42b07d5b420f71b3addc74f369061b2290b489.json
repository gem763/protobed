You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words,\" she told them, holding back tears.\n\nBut is her impassioned wake-up call enough to earn her the Nobel Peace Prize?\n\n\"Extremely unlikely,\" Henrik Urdal, director of the Peace Research Institute in Oslo (Prio), told AFP, citing two reasons for his scepticism.\n\n191007094414247\n\nHe argued that while some say climate change might aggravate conflicts in his view there is still no consensus on whether it is actually the cause of armed conflict. He also said her tender age could make the prize more of a burden than a reward.\n\n\"The only way I could see that happen is that she would be part of a shared prize like Malala,\" Urdal said, referring to Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai, who shared the 2014 prize - at age 17 - with Indian children's rights activist Kailash Satyarthi.\n\nNorwegian historian Asle Sveen echoed that view.\n\n\"Of course she is now an international star, in conflict with Donald Trump, and she put the searchlight on climate change better than anyone else,\" he said.\n\n\"What's against her is that she is only 16 years old,\" he continued, adding that he would be \"very surprised\" if she got the award.\n\nBut Dan Smith, director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri), believes Thunberg should be considered a \"serious candidate\" and that climate change is linked to conflict.\n\n\"First of all, I think that what she has done over the past year is extraordinary,\" Smith told AFP news agency.\n\n\"I think that climate change is an issue which is strongly related to security and peace.\"\n\n'Age of fake news'\n\nExperts think a more likely candidate would be Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who made peace with bitter foe Eritrea.\n\n\"Abiy Ahmed would be a good candidate, as his tenure has had peace-inducing effects in the country and on the region,\" said Peter Wallensteen, professor of Peace and Conflict Research at Sweden's Uppsala University.\n\n190901191445655\n\nPredicting the winner is always a challenge since the Norwegian Nobel Committee never reveals the names of the nominees. All that is known is that a total of 301 individuals and organisations have been nominated this year.\n\nExperts also suggest that the five-person committee could this year decide to focus on freedom of expression and information, at a time when such freedoms are under pressure in both democracies and authoritarian regimes.\n\n\"In the age of fake news and information overload... and the lack of transparency, the lack of accountability in many political processes, this is something that I would hope the committee would take very seriously and consider,\" Urdal said.\n\nPress organisations such as Reporters Without Borders (RSF) or the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) could then be possible winners.\n\nAs the migration crisis continues to dominate the political agenda, the UN refugee agency UNHCR and its head Filippo Grandi, as well as the organisation SOS Mediterranee, are also seen as potential winners.\n\nBroadly considered a controversial long shot, US President Donald Trump has nonetheless been mentioned for his efforts to mend old wounds with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nThe 2019 laureate will be revealed on Friday at 11:00 am (0900 GMT) at the Nobel Institute in Oslo.\n\nLast year, the award - consisting of a gold medal, a diploma, and nine million Swedish kronor - was given to two champions fighting sexual violence, Congolese gynaecologist Denis Mukwege and Yazidi activist Nadia Murad.", "description": "In little more than a year, Thunberg galvanised millions around the world to take part in climate change demonstrations.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/9/6d5e2aaabc62431cb418da2973236565_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
