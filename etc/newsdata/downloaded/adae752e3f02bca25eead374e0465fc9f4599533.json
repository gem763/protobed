Afrikaans okes start boy band after pic of them go viral!\n\nCape Town \u2013 There are very few things that South Africans like better than a meme or viral video with lots of local flavour.\n\nWhether it's Hugo being asked to phone the police or Faf de Klerk and a welsh rugby player getting close enough to kiss or exchange blows.\n\nOne of the best examples took place in April of this year when a Tweet \u2013 featuring four uniquely South African men in khaki - went viral.\n\nIt all started when comedian Donovan Goliath asked his followers to name the rap group. The comments were then flooded with mentions of \"vleis\" (meat in Afrikaans) and retweets like: \"I want wys jou vleis pants for myself.\"\n\nSEE THAT TWEET HERE:\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the men featured in that social media post, have struck while the braai grill was hot, so to speak and released their own song.\n\nTheir band name: Jan, Jan, Jan, their song title: Wys Jou Vleis. The song title is a no-brainer but why Jan times three? Well, that's because the band is comprised of Lang Jan, Klein Jan and Fris Jan.\n\nThe new, Afrikaans, song was released on Friday, 25 October just in time for all of your end of year parties.\n\nIt was accompanied by a music video that features two 'tannies' who would enjoy seeing some sexy boys in some short, shorts.\n\nWATCH THE MUSIC VIDEO HERE:\n\n\n\n", "description": "Lang Jan, Klein Jan and Fris Jan have delivered the music video that we didn't know we needed!", "authors": ["Alex Isaacs"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7982/0fa1e3f42f564a72940bc918eb323b5f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
