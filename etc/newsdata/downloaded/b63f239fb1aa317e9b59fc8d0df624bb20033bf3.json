(Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nHe had sat quietly through months of debate, trying to remain impassive even as the conversations filled his head with images of the 26 killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School and the 17 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\n\nHe had listened to parents at public meetings. He had read the three-page letter from the teachers union expressing \u201cour strong opposition to the proposal.\u201d He had absorbed statistics on accidental shootings, heard about emergency response times from law enforcement, and tried to imagine his version of what one expert described as \u201cthe worst possible situation that your district could ever find itself in.\u201d\n\nNow, as the five school board members of the Warren Local School District in southeastern Ohio held their June meeting in the basement of an old brick building, Kyle Newton, 43, realized that after 20 years as an educator, his job was about to change.\n\n\u201cNext resolution is to give authorization for the superintendent to train and designate certain individuals to be armed,\u201d the board president said.\n\nThat was Newton. He was the superintendent.\n\n\u201cQuestions?\u201d the board president asked. \u201cConcerns?\u201d\n\nSimilar discussions were underway across the country. After the 1999 shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado, the American education system put considerable energy into preventing the next school shooting, and when the next school shooting inevitably occurred, the next. Some districts opted for metal detectors. Others hired guards. There are sophisticated machines that check visitors for criminal records, and companies for hire to monitor students\u2019 social media postings for warning signs.\n\nAmong the most extreme and divisive options, some school districts have chosen to arm staff members, putting guns in the hands of teachers to protect schools from guns in the hands of students. And now Warren was ready to make that choice.\n\nAs extreme as the option was, no questions were asked and no concerns expressed. The vote was unanimous, and as Newton drove home that night along the quiet back roads of Washington County, it was as the nation\u2019s newest superintendent in charge of a school district where staffers were going to be armed.\n\n\u201cDo it logically,\u201d he would keep reminding himself over the next 65 days, which was how much time he had to figure out how to get this done by the first day of school.\n\nHe passed house after house, many with his students inside.\n\nAnd, he presumed, with guns inside, too.\n\n***\n\n\n\nSuperintendent Kyle Newton of the Warren Local School District oversaw the selection of teachers to be armed on campus after the school board approved the plan this year. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nThe school district Newton oversees is in an isolated corner of the state, pressed against the West Virginia border and two hours from Columbus, the nearest major metropolitan area. It has one high school, one middle school, two elementary schools, and almost 300 staff members. Its 2,100 students are pulled from a sprawl of 196 square miles, making Warren the largest geographic school district in the region.\n\nThe area is an economic mash-up of rural poverty and middle-class subdivisions. It is considered safe \u2014 the rate of violent crime is half the state average \u2014 and politically conservative. The long country roads cutting across the school district border family farms and the occasional church, and in the fall and winter, the woods echo with gunshots as locals take aim at turkeys and rabbits. Hunting is such a prominent part of life here that the first day of deer season is a school holiday at Warren.\n\nIt\u2019s a day that Newton typically uses to work, since he is neither a hunter nor a gun owner. He did not grow up with firearms and has not regularly fired a weapon since a stint in the U.S. Army Reserve in the late 1990s. But guns are on his mind. Even though there\u2019s never been a school shooting or a close call in his district, the threat has penetrated the remoteness of a place where remoteness has come to feel less an asset than a vulnerability.\n\nNothing made that more concrete to Newton than something a sheriff\u2019s department official told him earlier in the year, after pointing out that there were typically three deputies on duty at any one time in the county, patrolling 640 square miles. \u201cKyle, we aren\u2019t going to be here,\u201d Newton remembers the sheriff\u2019s official saying, if violence were to break out.\n\nThe official also mentioned that the average duration of a mass shooting was about four minutes, which further clarified things for Newton. Four minutes was the time it took to drive from his office to the high school and middle school. A right turn out of the gravel parking lot. Past the diner. Past the post office. Up a hill. A reliable four minutes, by which time, he realized, the worst would be over.\n\nAll of that, along with his own career arc, helped Newton see why the school board felt the need to take some type of action. He began teaching in 1998, just a few months before the Columbine High School shooting. He became superintendent in 2013, just a few months after the Sandy Hook shooting in late 2012. His wife is a teacher, and they educated their children in public schools, so he understood safety concerns at a personal as well as a professional level. Year by year and shooting by shooting, the question of how to keep students safe was reflected in the phone calls he would get from parents wondering what was being done. But it really was after the Marjory Stoneman Douglas shooting in 2018 that the pressure to act, rather than react, intensified. \u201cAfter that, pretty much everybody\u2019s world changed in education,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had to do something.\u201d\n\nWhether he agreed with the school board\u2019s decision to go to such an extreme didn\u2019t really matter \u2014 the decision was the board\u2019s, and his job was to make it happen. But he was conflicted. \u201cI\u2019m not saying I\u2019m for it or against it,\u201d he said. \u201cWould I want my wife to carry a gun in school? Probably not. But when it comes down to having the worst day of worst days happen here, I don\u2019t ever want to be able to say I didn\u2019t do everything possible for giving my students the best chance.\u201d\n\nOne day, after making the four-minute drive from his office up the hill, he stood between the middle school and high school, where construction crews had begun pouring the foundation for a new $62 million campus. Once completed in two years, the new buildings will house all the district\u2019s students and staff \u2014 the largest gathering of people in the county on any given day. It will have entrances with clear sightlines of approach, and buzz-in access controlled by a staff member in a vestibule. It will have hallways and classrooms with lockdown doors that can be triggered remotely by a cellphone app. It will have windows with shatterproof coating.\n\n\u201cThis will totally change our district,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m so excited.\u201d\n\nNow, turning his attention to the aging school buildings currently in use, he looked at the high school. \u201cThe first time I saw it I thought it was the weirdest looking building I\u2019d ever seen. Our high school was built in the \u201970s, and it totally has that California school design look.\u201d He pointed to the glass-walled walkways connecting the buildings. \u201cA hazard.\u201d He imagined those exposed walkways filled with students, and in less than two months now, with armed teachers as well.\n\n***\n\n\n\nTeachers and other schools employees listen to remarks by Newton a few days before the start of the academic year this month.

(Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nNewton, the superintendent, addresses employees of his district\u2019s schools as they prepare for the new academic year. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nHow that would happen would be primarily up to Newton. Ohio law leaves specific decisions about \u201cwho is authorized to carry deadly weapons or dangerous ordnance\u201d to local school districts. The only requirement is a federal one that says any designated staffer must have a valid permit to carry a concealed weapon. Other than that, every decision would be Newton\u2019s.\n\nHe wanted an orderly process. Do it logically. The district was small enough for the superintendent to already know about any issues, and all of the staff members who applied were good employees. He interviewed them separately, and after going through logistics, he steered the conversations to the blunt responsibility the teachers were taking on. It wasn\u2019t about breaking up fights or de-escalating tense situations, he said. It was about gunfire. If shots were fired, they were to engage the attacker.\n\n\u201cYou understand that you might have to shoot a student?\u201d he asked each of the applicants. \u201cIt could be your student, it could be one that\u2019s not your student, but you\u2019re going to have to make that decision and do it.\u201d\n\nAs a final step, Newton went over the applications one day with the school board president, the school district\u2019s treasurer, and a sheriff\u2019s deputy who, once classes began, would be rotating among the schools. \u201cIt\u2019s always going to be us four,\u201d he told the group, any of whom could object to an applicant.\n\nHe explained about the concealed carry permit and said that any applicant they approved would take a three-day training run by an Ohio gun advocacy nonprofit group designed specifically for teachers. In addition, Newton said, anyone they approved would be required to go through annual background checks and drug testing, and would have to fire at least 100 rounds a month on a range.\n\nOn a table in front of Newton was a stack of files. Before picking up the first one, he mentioned the need for confidentiality. No one could know any names, he said. Not teachers. Not students. The program depended not only on the fact that some teachers would be armed, but also on the illusion that any teacher might be.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019re going to have a kind of \u2018don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u2019 policy,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s going to be your hardest thing,\u201d Brad Holbert, the sheriff\u2019s deputy, said. \u201cWith social media and the way things are now, I think it\u2019s going to be impossible. It\u2019s going to leak.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are the consequences of violating the confidentiality agreement?\u201d the board president, Bob Crum, asked.\n\n\u201cTechnically you are violating board policy,\u201d Newton said. \u201cThere could be a range of possibilities.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere will be people who are totally against this, and they are going to search and destroy and witch-hunt,\u201d Holbert said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to put it on social media. I think this could be a disaster.\u201d\n\nNewton nodded and scribbled down a note. He lifted the first folder from the stack, flipped it open, and said the person was thinking of retiring soon and wouldn\u2019t be a good candidate. A denial.\n\nHe opened the next file, said the name of the applicant, and took out the form authorizing the staff member to \u201cconvey a deadly weapon in a school safety zone.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnybody have a problem?\u201d\n\nNo one said anything, and after a moment Newton signed and dated the form, closed the file, and opened the next one.\n\n\u201cThat one surprised me,\u201d he said after announcing the name. \u201cShe\u2019s going to do a lot of \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cSoul searching?\u201d someone filled in.\n\n\u201cWhen she gets into the tactical training, I don\u2019t know if she has her head wrapped around that,\u201d Newton said. \u201cShe said, \u2018I think I would have to see it to know for sure.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAgain no one objected.\n\nNext file. \u201cHe\u2019s an avid shooter,\u201d Newton said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that. Would you have known that? He\u2019s super excited about this \u2014 in a good way.\u201d\n\nAgain, no concerns, and Newton signed.\n\nNext file. \u201cAnybody have an issue?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo these people really understand the liability issues involved in this?\u201d Holbert asked after the last of the files had been discussed and the last of the applicants had been approved. \u201cDo they have any clue?\u201d\n\nIf something were to happen, he continued, all of the armed staffers would be held responsible. \u201cRegardless,\u201d he said. \u201cFifteen years ago, I signed up for that when I became a law enforcement officer. These guys signed up to be educators, and they now have the opportunity to lose everything. Have you addressed that with them?\u201d\n\nNewton nodded again and scribbled more notes, and with that the meeting came to an end. The Warren Local School District had its first group of armed staffers, and Newton began calling them to tell them they\u2019d been approved.\n\n\u201cI kind of knew that I would be,\u201d one of them told Newton.\n\n\u201cAm I allowed to know who the others are?\u201d another asked.\n\n\u201cLet me think about it,\u201d Newton said.\n\n***\n\n\n\nA pistol in the waistband of a teacher, who will wear an outer shirt to hide the weapon at school. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nSoon after that, late on a weekday afternoon, two of the teachers stood in a clearing off a road that twisted deep into the county, past abandoned trailers and farms.\n\nOne of them, who\u2019d been approved, fixed a target to a metal frame, which was cut out of a piece of cardboard into the vague shape of a human head and torso. Nearby, the other, who still had to go through training, was snapping 9mm full metal jacket rounds into magazines.\n\nBoth teachers \u2014 whose names The Post agreed not to disclose for safety reasons \u2014 were lifelong shooters, and the one fixing the target in place was the type of teacher who liked to hug his students and, especially after the Marjory Stoneman Douglas shootings, assure them that he would give up his life for theirs.\n\nHe had no doubt he would do that, or, now that he had been approved to be an armed teacher, to defend his students with force. What he did worry about was identifying a troubled student before things reached such a point. Years before, he\u2019d had a student who filled his notebooks with violent drawings, and who\u2019d turned out okay, but he remembered thinking: Would he be able to distinguish a true threat amid the panorama of teenage angst he saw every day?\n\nTo that end, he read whatever he could about mass shooters, as if understanding their lives would be the key to predicting the possibility of violence. He also had enrolled in the gun training course for teachers, hoping the experience \u2014 learning statistics, the legal issues, the correct way to round a corner in a firefight \u2014 would put him closer to knowing why students attack.\n\nThat was why he had come with his friend to this abandoned property, to run through a series of timed drills so the friend would know what to expect when he took the firearms course.\n\n\u201cThe first one is at three yards,\u201d the teacher said, reading from a binder of training drills. \u201cOne body shot. Two seconds. And we\u2019re going to do it five times.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, bud,\u201d his friend said. \u201cYou\u2019re up.\u201d\n\nThe teacher faced the target, a 9mm Smith & Wesson M&P Shield in the holster at his waist. It was compact. It weighed less than some of the textbooks his students carried. It had an eight-shot capacity.\n\nHis friend raised a timer that would start the drill with an electronic beep.\n\n\u201cShooter ready?\u201d\n\n\u201cReady.\u201d\n\nBeep.\n\n\n\nTeachers and administrators from a Colorado school district undergo firearms training in Commerce City, Colo., in 2018. (Jason Connolly/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe teacher grabbed his chest with his left hand, yanked up his shirt, reached into the waistband of his shorts with his right hand, raised the handgun, brought his left hand to the grip, and squeezed the trigger. The barrel jerked. The gunshot echoed across the clearing and the sycamore trees beyond.\n\nIt was a hit in the center, straight through the heart. The teacher covered the fresh holes with small pieces of tape, leaving his friend with a fresh target.\n\n\u201cShooter ready?\u201d the teacher said as his friend took his place.\n\n\u201cReady.\u201d\n\nThe friend\u2019s first shot went through what would be a person\u2019s lower abdomen.\n\nThe two traded places, and traded places again. The beeps and gunshots continued. Five yards. Beep. Ten yards. Beep.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see if I got anything good here,\u201d the teacher said after several more rounds, returning to the target.\n\n\u201cOne of them went through the uprights,\u201d his friend said. A miss.\n\n\u201cI got to do that again,\u201d the teacher grumbled. He hadn\u2019t shot in two weeks, and it was showing.\n\nBeep.\n\nAnother miss. \u201cToo much finger on the trigger there,\u201d the friend said. \u201cTry to slow down just a hair on this next one.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going from getting upset with the timing to getting upset with the accuracy,\u201d the teacher said.\n\n\u201cTiming will come.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d the teacher said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to be accurate.\u201d\n\nNow fifteen yards. Beep.\n\n\u201cYou got the active shooter in the jugular,\u201d the friend said, eyeing the fresh hole.\n\nTwenty-five yards. The teacher let out a breath. They\u2019d been at it for a while. The sun was down below the hills. Beyond the target fireflies were poking small nicks of light into the dark tree line. Sweat and humidity were beginning to glaze his protective glasses.\n\nBeep. Through the stomach.\n\n\u201cWay too quick,\u201d the teacher chastised himself.\n\nHe got ready again.\n\nThere was so much to do before school began. He had to buy new shirts roomy enough to hide the holster. He needed to rethink how he hugged students so they wouldn\u2019t feel the gun. And, he was realizing, he needed to shoot more so he\u2019d be ready in every way, including psychologically, if the moment ever came.\n\n\u201cThey say the last thing you want to do is make eye contact,\u201d the teacher said now to his friend.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d his friend said. \u201cYou have to look at it as an active shooter is an active shooter.\u201d\n\n***\n\nFive weeks later, the teacher woke at 4:30 a.m. and couldn\u2019t get back to sleep. Typical first-day nerves, he thought, even though he did also feel a new touch of anxiety.\n\nIn the intervening weeks, he had continued preparing, spending more time at the range until he was regularly hitting the target to his satisfaction. Six new shirts were hanging in his closet, and he had tried out a half-dozen holsters before settling on the one he would wear today.\n\nHe showered. He dressed. He clipped the holster behind him, to the inside of his waistband, and snapped in the Smith & Wesson, which he had loaded the day before with eight 9mm Hornady self-defense rounds \u2014 seven in the magazine and one in the chamber. He would wear the shirt untucked, and he now jumped up and down to make sure movement didn\u2019t expose the weapon.\n\nIt didn\u2019t, but the gun was hitting him wrong, against his tailbone, so he brought the holster around to the front and decided that would be better, despite what he now described as the \u201cinherent dangers\u201d of having a gun pointed toward the top of his legs. \u201cBecause you get the femoral artery if I do anything really stupid,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I can hide it a little better. I can get to it a little easier.\u201d\n\nThe sun was rising now. By coincidence, on this same day, at this very same time, some of the students who had survived the shootings at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida and had gone on to form a gun-control organization called March for Our Lives were unveiling a proposal online. It called for bans on military-style weapons and high-capacity magazines, a mandatory gun buyback program for such weapons, and a national licensing and gun registry.\n\n\n\nSchools Superintendent Kyle Newton on the first day of classes in the Warren district. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cCreated by survivors, so you don\u2019t have to be one,\u201d was how the proposal was framed, and meanwhile, the teacher kissed his wife, got into his car and drove toward his school, where at 6:45 a.m., Kyle Newton was already standing in the parking lot, a bright-\n\norange traffic vest over his blue polo shirt.\n\n\u201cKeep moving guys. Go, go, go,\u201d Newton called to parents, waving them forward and looking at the growing line of cars and school buses. It was the typical chaos of the first day. There were dozens of students waiting outside for the doors to open, and then hundreds, and then the bell rang and they pushed inside, passing four new red stickers on the glass doors that said, \u201cWarning: Some Employees Are Armed.\u201d\n\nIt was 7:40 a.m. now, the precise moment of a different day, at a different school, when a student with a shotgun walked into the art department at Santa Fe High School in Texas on May 18, 2018, and yelled \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you!\u201d as classmates barricaded themselves in a supply closet. Eight students and two teachers died that day, but here, on this day in Warren, the teacher was taking his place at the front of his classroom and Newton was standing outside, congratulating one of his principals on such a smooth start. \u201cThat went about as well as it could have gone,\u201d he said.\n\nThe morning passed. It was now 9:35 a.m., the same time as when a gunshot went through a glass panel next to the locked front door of Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., on Dec. 14, 2012. That morning ended with the deaths of six staff members and 20 children ages 6 to 7. Here at Warren\u2019s Little Hocking Elementary School, 23 first-graders were adjusting to their new classroom, finding their desks, their jacket hooks, the breakfast cart with their fruit and graham crackers; after the Pledge of Allegiance, they were all sitting on the floor listening as the teacher read a book called \u201cFirst Day Jitters.\u201d\n\n11:19 a.m. now. It was the time in Columbine, Colo., on April 20, 1999, when the first shots were fired at Columbine High School. Twelve students and one teacher died that day as the shooters moved through school\u2019s library, hallways and cafeteria; here, in Warren High School\u2019s cafeteria, lunch was coming to an end when a laughing student who had dyed her hair pink declared, \u201cI\u2019m having an existential crisis!\u201d\n\n2:21 p.m. now, the time when, on Feb. 14, 2018, Marjory Stoneman Douglas went into a code red lockdown. Seventeen people would die; here, the high school\u2019s hallways were empty. Sunlight was filling the glass corridors that Newton often worried about. The sounds from classrooms were of teachers doing nothing other than teaching.\n\n\u201cDo any of you know what mariposa means?\u201d\n\n\u201cFrench Polynesia. Anyone know where that is?\u201d\n\n\u201cFlash cards! You put the element\u2019s name on one side, the symbol on the other. September 19 is roughly 30 days from now. You can get all 92 done if you do a few each day.\u201d\n\n2:49 p.m. now, and the first school day was over. On March 21, 2005, at Red Lake High School in Red Lake, Minn., that was when the first of seven people was shot and killed, but in Warren, where there were no shootings on this first day, no threats, no incidents of any kind, and Newton was back in his office, thinking he had made his deadline. He had been logical about it. He had done it.\n\n\n\nPolice inspect people coming out of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., after the shooting there on Feb. 14, 2018, in which 17 students and staff members were killed.

(Anonymous/AP)\n\n***\n\nTwo days later, he gathered with several of his armed staff members and the sheriff\u2019s deputy to talk about how the first days had gone.\n\nThere were some questions.\n\nAnd some concerns.\n\n\u201cLike if I\u2019m at the middle school and something should happen at the high school, should we head to the high school?\u201d one person asked.\n\n\u201cI thought about that, too,\u201d Newton said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we have to determine.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday I realized how much longer it takes to use the restroom when you carry,\u201d said the woman who\u2019d been approved, referring to the single-user bathroom set aside for staff. \u201cI\u2019m thinking, \u2018I have to take this out. Where am I going to put it?\u2019 Because you always see phones up on the toilet paper rack. People always leave their phones there. So I put it on the sink.\u201d\n\nNewton sat listening.\n\n\u201cAnother thing we need to discuss is what kind of rounds the sheriff\u2019s department is carrying,\u201d a teacher now said. \u201cWe want to all be on the same page as far as defense rounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to have the same as they do?\u201d one of the others asked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to help.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy is that?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey told us in the class, if something happens, you want to be on the same page as your sheriff\u2019s department. Your sheriff is carrying something that\u2019s tried and true and tested, so why are you carrying Hornadys when they\u2019re carrying Winchesters? So if they\u2019re carrying Hornadys, we want to be carrying Hornadys. If they\u2019re carrying Winchester, we want to carry Winchesters.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a really good point. That\u2019s exactly why we\u2019re having this meeting,\u201d Newton said, and as the conversation went on, he was realizing that even though he\u2019d met his deadline, he wasn\u2019t done at all.\n\n\n\nStudents arrive by bus for the first day of school. For the first time, a number of employees in the district\u2019s schools would be carrying concealed firearms. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nThere was a discussion about gun safes.\n\nThere was a discussion about \u201cball ammo\u201d vs. \u201cdefense ammo.\u201d\n\nAnd now the discussion moved on to one more thing Newton hadn\u2019t thought about before \u2014 the football game that would be starting in a few hours. Like the schools themselves, the football field was a designated gun-free zone.\n\nAt the far end of the conference table, Holbert, the school\u2019s deputy, spoke up.\n\n\u201cI can tell you for a fact, there\u2019s people in your stands with guns.
