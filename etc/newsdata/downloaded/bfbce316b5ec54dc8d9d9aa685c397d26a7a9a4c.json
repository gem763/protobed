Watch out Emma. Come to think of it, watch out Andy Murray.\n\nThe list of diversions mean in the short term coping with life in Civvy Street should not be impossibly harrowing for the man who described Saturday as the \u2018hardest day of my life\u2019.\n\nDuring his Punchestown trip McCoy will also visit Robbie and JT McNamara, both battling degrees of paralysis after bad falls. It will inject a dose of sobering reality into his situation.\n\nMcCoy said: \u2018The fear of retirement is going to get worse in a month or a year. I think I will be all right in the first few weeks because I have things to do and I will be busy.\n\n\u2018I will see Robbie McNamara on Tuesday and John Thomas on Wednesday. It will be nice to see the two lads and will put a lot of things into perspective.\u2019\n\nSean Bowen won the conditional jockey title at Sandown on Saturday as is tipped for a bright future\n\nThere are media work offers to consider and a likely role with boss JP McManus. But McCoy will need something to satisfy his enormous work ethic.\n\nLast week he did not accept rides because he wanted to begin weaning himself off racing.\n\nBut on Thursday night, trainer Paul Webber texted McCoy, saying he was short of a work rider for Friday morning, start time 7.45am.\n\nThe 20-time champion jockey was not late.\n\nHe also feels, painfully, that even his amazing records will be broken, perhaps even by the emerging Sean Bowen.\n\nThe 17-year-old winner of Saturday feature bet365 Gold Cup on Just A Par has lifted the champion conditional jockey crown earlier in his life than McCoy managed.\n\nHe has the same agent in Dave Roberts, who said: \u2018What he is doing is freaky. We want to keep his feet on the ground but he has some talent.\u2019", "description": "MARCUS TOWNEND: It was a simple slip of the tongue, instantly corrected minutes after his last ever ride at Sandown on Saturday.
