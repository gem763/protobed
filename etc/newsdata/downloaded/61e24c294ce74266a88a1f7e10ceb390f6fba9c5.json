It is not just one or two players that we rely on.\"\n\nJapan have now won three games at the World Cup for the second time in their history, repeating the feat of 2015, and Joseph added that they now have confidence that the can seal a place in the last eight, in contrast to four years ago.\n\n\"Even today, the belief in our team has grown and I guess we'll need it going into next week. It\u2019s the first time ever Japan's got themselves in the position where they can top the pool, so it's new territory for us.\n\n\"Scotland are a very good team with a lot of experience and x-factor. We saw how clinical they were against Samoa (in a 34-0 win).\n\n\"I think it was always going to come down to the Scotland game. It\u2019s going to be a ripper. I can\u2019t wait and the players can\u2019t wait.\"\n\n\u00a9 (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2019.", "description": "A relieved Jamie Joseph praised the never-say-die attitude of his Japan side as they claimed what could be a crucial bonus-point with the final play of Saturday\u2019s 38-19 Rugby World Cup victory over Samoa at the City of Toyota Stadium.
