Adam Schiff, announced a formal impeachment inquiry against President Trump on September 24, the ensuing proceedings could cost $2 million or more\n\nAs presidential impeachments are rare, it's hard to anticipate exactly how the Trump impeachment will unfold and how much it will cost.\n\nOnly two presidents have been formally impeached in American history \u2014 Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton \u2014 and neither were successfully removed from office.\n\nHowever, taking what happened in previous impeachments into account can shed some light on the expected costs associated with impeaching the current one.\n\nIn 1999, for instance, it cost more than one million dollars to impeach Bill Clinton. Though this may not seem like a lot of money for sitting presidents, part of this is paid for by the federal government, which is funded by taxpayers.\n\n'Impeachment of a president implicates both official and personal issues,' Ross Garber, a lawyer who defended four governors facing impeachment told the Daily Mail.\n\n'Accordingly, presidents have historically had government-paid lawyers represent them in addition to their personal counsel. On the House side, there are no personal issues at stake, so government lawyers shoulder the burden.'\n\nBill Clinton, who served as President from 1993 to 2001 and was impeached in 1999 for 'high crimes and misdemeanors', is the only modern American president to be impeached besides Trump\n\nAndrew Johnson, president from 1862 to 1865, was impeached in 1868 for dismissing Edwin Stanton, Secretary of War, from the cabinet without Congressional approval, thus violating the Tenure of Office Act. It's unknown how much the proceedings for his impeachment cost\n\nThe House of Representatives launched the impeachment proceedings against Clinton for 'high crimes and misdemeanors' \u2014 more specifically, obstruction of justice and lying under oath.\n\nMost impeachment costs are incurred by paying for lawyers' time and support staff. It's also necessary to take travel costs, expert fees and expenses into consideration.\n\nIn Clinton's case, expense records obtained by the AP at the time reveal that the chief Republican investigator during the 1999 impeachment proceedings, David P. Schippers, was paid $20,000 per month for his work on the case. Additionally, Democratic counsel, Abbe Lowell, was paid $18,000 per month.\n\nThat means that just the House's impeachment investigators earned a total of $190,000 for their work. Had the impeachment proceedings continued for longer than five months, the investigators would have been earning an annual income of more than $200,000 each.\n\nWhen accounting for inflation, a similar impeachment process in 2019 would cost almost double what it did 20 years ago.\n\nInvestigator's salaries would be around the $30,000 per month figure, meaning five months of work from both sides would amount to $297,000 if the Trump proceedings followed the same route.\n\nSo if we do go by Clinton's standards, the cost would be upwards of $1.8 million \u2014 after also taking into account support staff salary and expenses.\n\nAlan Baron, who served as Special Impeachment Counsel for four Judicial impeachments, told the Daily Mail that costs could vary significantly based on how the Trump investigation unfolds.\n\n'If we are only talking about the telephone conversation with the president of Ukraine and related facts, that would be narrowly focused and less costly,' he said.\n\nTrump, pictured here speaking to members of the media outside the White House, has adamantly denied any wrongdoings and has insisted he is innocent\n\n'Putting aside the cost of an actual impeachment trial, all of this preliminary resistance and maneuvering, including going to court, inevitably drives up the legal costs.\n\n'If you include the allegations of the Mueller Report in the articles of impeachment the costs obviously go up, though you already have the benefit of Mueller\u2019s work,' Baron said.\n\nThe two-year investigation of Russian election interference led by Robert Mueller cost more than $30 million.\n\nIt seems extremely likely that the scope of the impeachment investigation will extend beyond the Ukraine scandal which will almost certainly raise costs associated with the investigation.\n\nEarlier this week, the House of Representatives General Counsel, Doug Letter, told a federal judge that impeachment counts may also include obstruction of Congress, which is one of the 10 potentially obstructive acts outlined in the Mueller Report that Trump has not been prosecuted for.\n\nTrump allegedly pressured Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden during a July 25 phone call.\n\nThe two-year investigation of Russian election interference led by Robert Mueller cost more than $30 million\n\n'I can't emphasize enough, it's not just Ukraine,' Letter said.\n\nCosts associated with impeachment, however, extend far beyond monetary costs.\n\nSome Americans, and more specifically House Democrats, have argued that it simply isn't worth it to impeach the president, especially those who fear the move will cost them the 2020 election.\n\nBy firing up Trump's support base \u2014 a group that generally believes Democrats will do anything to avoid another four years under the Trump administration \u2014 the impeachment could encourage more Republicans to support the President in the upcoming election.\n\nThese fears are not unfounded, considering Clinton's approval rating jumped significantly when he was impeached.\n\nAlthough Trump's approval rating has remained steady thus far, it is possible he could see a similar boost at some point in the next few months.\n\nOnly time will tell.", "description": "Donald Trump is the third president in American history to be impeached - and if the impeachment proceedings are similar to Clinton's 1999 proceedings, it could cost upwards of $1.8 million.", "authors": ["Megan Harney"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/16/19445914-0-image-a-4_1570549512408.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
