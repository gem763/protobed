(Kevin Wolf via Flickr)\n\nTODAY\u2019S DAILY DIGIT\n\nA somewhat subjective rating of the day\u2019s weather, on a scale of 0 to 10.\n\n4/10: The clouds and showers are a bit of a letdown after such a stellar weekend, but our lawns could use a little moisture.\n\nEXPRESS FORECAST\n\nToday: Cloudy with a few showers. Highs: 75-80.\n\nTonight: Evening showers possible, then mostly cloudy. Lows: 60-65.\n\nTomorrow: Mostly sunny. Highs: 80-85.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post headquarters.\n\nFORECAST IN DETAIL\n\nA bit of a cloudy, murky day follows our fantastic weekend. But the sun won\u2019t hide long and, by the middle of the week, it\u2019s beating down on us and initiating an early-September heat spell. We should hit 90 degrees on Wednesday and Thursday, and maybe Friday and/or Saturday, too, before a cold front offers relief.\n\nGet our daily forecasts on your Amazon Alexa device.

Most of the day is dry, but some showers could pop up, and maybe even a rumble of thunder, mostly in the late afternoon. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nTonight: Cloudy this evening with a shower or thundershower possible. Clouds slowly decrease overnight with lows 60-65.

Keep reading for the forecast through the weekend...\n\nTomorrow (Tuesday): Increasing sunshine and a little warmer. Highs should climb into the low 80s, and there\u2019s a touch of mugginess in the air (dew points in the mid-60s). Winds are light and variable. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nTomorrow night: Partly cloudy and mild as lows only fall back into the mid- to upper 60s. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nA LOOK AHEAD\n\nJuly-like weather returns Wednesday and Thursday. Skies are partly to mostly sunny, and it\u2019s not only hot, but also quite humid (dew points in the upper 60s to near 70). This means highs near 90 on Wednesday and 90 to 95 on Thursday. Especially on Thursday, there could be a few late-day showers and storms. The nights are partly cloudy and balmy, with lows 70 to 75. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nThe temperature forecast on Friday is a little tricky depending on what side of a warm front we end up on. We could be cloudier and closer to 80 or sunnier and near 90 for a third straight day. With that front around, we\u2019ll have a chance of showers and storms, especially in the afternoon and early evening. Mostly cloudy and mild Friday night, with lows near 70. Confidence: Medium\n\nThe weekend should be pretty nice for the most part. It\u2019s still very warm and humid on Saturday, and we can\u2019t rule out some showers and storms, probably late in the day, as a cold front comes through. Highs range from 85 to 90. By Sunday, it\u2019s neither as hot nor as humid, with highs 80 to 85. Overnight lows are mostly in the 60s.
