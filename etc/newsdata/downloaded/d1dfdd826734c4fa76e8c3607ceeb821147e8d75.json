During this month\u2019s debate, she accused the debate moderators and fellow contenders for the Democratic nomination of failing to adequately prioritize the discussion of abortion rights. The former California attorney general also made headlines during the first Democratic debate in June when she called out former vice president Joe Biden for remarks he made praising two segregationist senators.\n\n\u201cIt was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and careers on the segregation of race in this country,\u201d Harris said from the debate stage.\n\n\u201cIt was not only that, but you also worked with them to oppose busing,\u201d she continued. \u201cThere was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools and she was bused to school every day. That little girl was me.\u201d\n\nBiden made the offending remarks several weeks earlier when he reminisced about bygone days when politics was characterized by a higher level of civility, citing his ability to get along with two segregationist senators despite their differences as an example.\n\n\u201cAt least there was some civility. We got things done. We didn\u2019t agree on much of anything,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBut today you look at the other side and you\u2019re the enemy.\u201d\n\nHarris is currently polling in fifth place behind former vice president Joe Biden, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Senator Bernie Sanders, and South Bend, Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris described electability as the \u201celephant in the room\u201d of her campaign and pondered whether America is ready for a woman of color to be commander in chief.\"Essentially, is America ready for a woman and a woman of color to be president of the United States", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/o364Yx7LKqIGbWefiyDcOg--~B/aD01OTc7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/694d86af6a92fbf930aa298f56161d4b", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
