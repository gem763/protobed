But now he is pulling hair out and has bald patches which look terrible.\n\nWhat can we do to stop him?\n\nName and address withheld.\n\nTrichotillomania is where someone pulls, twists or plucks their hair in a repetitive way, leading to patches of obvious hair loss\n\nThe condition you have described is called trichotillomania.\n\nThis is where someone pulls, twists or plucks their hair in a repetitive way, leading to traction alopecia \u2014 patches of obvious hair loss as a result of the hair being pulled under strain.\n\nOverly tight ponytails can also cause traction alopecia.\n\nMost children develop repetitive behaviours at some stage, perhaps because they find them comforting.\n\nTypically these habits, such as thumb-sucking or nail-biting, are harmless and the child grows out of them eventually.\n\nWhether they are considered abnormal depends on how often and how persistently they occur, and their effect on the child\u2019s emotional and social well-being.\n\nThe fact that your grandson has obvious bald patches suggests he has a habit disorder that needs treatment.\n\nAlthough trichotillomania does not usually interfere with physical health or everyday functioning, it might lead to teasing or bullying at school.\n\nIt may also be a sign that he has another associated problem that is not yet apparent, such as obsessive compulsive disorder, so some form of action is required.\n\nMost children develop repetitive behaviours at some stage, perhaps because they find them comforting. Typically these habits are harmless and the child grows out of them eventually\n\nWhat\u2019s more, it could prove too frustrating for you all to try to train him into breaking the habit himself, so it would be far better to obtain professional assessment and accept the help offered.\n\nIt would, therefore, be advisable to consult a paediatrician, child psychologist or child psychiatrist \u2014 your family doctor should be able to arrange a suitable referral.\n\nOne option that a child psychologist might try with him is a habit reversal technique.\n\nThis involves teaching the child to substitute a different behaviour for the hair twiddling, such as gently clasping one earlobe between thumb and forefinger.\n\nBut before that, a diagnostic assessment is paramount, to be certain there are no other, less obvious problems in his psychological or emotional life.\n\nI have pernicious anaemia. I had vitamin B12 injections every three months for 24 years until I was 64.\n\nI was told originally it would be for the rest of my life and specialists say you cannot get better from pernicious anaemia.\n\nBut my doctor cut down the injections from four yearly to two yearly \u2014 then told me I didn\u2019t need them at all. Your thoughts please.\n\nMrs J. J. Sinnott-Martin, Spalding, Lincs.\n\nHow confusing. The reasons for the change of advice over your vitamin B12 injections remain unclear \u2014 as you say, the diagnosis of pernicious anaemia implies that the condition is lifelong.\n\nWrite to Dr Scurr To contact Dr Scurr with a health query, write to him at Good Health Daily Mail, 2 Derry Street, London W8 5TT or email drmartin@dailymail.co.uk - including contact details. Dr Scurr cannot enter into personal correspondence. His replies cannot apply to individual cases and should be taken in a general context. Always consult your own GP with any health worries.\n\nFirst, I shall explain the condition for the sake of other readers.\n\nPernicious anaemia can have various causes. Essentially, it develops if someone becomes unable to absorb vitamin B12 from food (a nutrient only found naturally in foods of animal origin, including meat, poultry, eggs and fish).\n\nThe vitamin is absorbed in the last part of the small intestine, but for this to happen it needs to be combined with a protein called intrinsic factor, which is secreted by the lining of the stomach.\n\nPatients who have undergone major surgery to remove the stomach or some of the small intestine are, therefore, at risk of developing pernicious anaemia.\n\nInflammatory bowel disease can also lead to poor absorption of vitamin B12.\n\nInflammatory bowel disease or major bowel surgery can lead to poor absorption of vitamin B12\n\nBut in most people the condition is an autoimmune disease. In these patients \u2014 for reasons we don\u2019t fully understand \u2014 the body creates antibodies that damage the cells lining the stomach so it can no longer generate intrinsic factor.\n\nLow levels of B12 can also be down to diet or even \u2014 in rare cases \u2014 due to infection, with the giant fish tapeworm diphyllobothrium latum, which gobbles up the vitamin, depriving its host.\n\nThe body does have stores of vitamin B12 in the liver, so it can take up to three years for symptoms to develop.\n\nVitamin B12 is vital for the formation of blood cells in the bone marrow, which is why a lack of it causes a form of anaemia, leading to symptoms such as fatigue, pallor, palpitations, breathlessness and headache.\n\nVitamin B12 is vital for the formation of blood cells in the bone marrow, which is why a lack of it causes a form of anaemia, with symptoms such as fatigue, pallor and headache\n\nIt\u2019s also critical for the normal function of the brain and nerves, and so a deficiency can cause problems with memory and mood as well as tingling and numbness.\n\nSome patients experience mood changes months before the onset of anaemia. This is why patients with psychiatric illness and dementia are routinely tested for vitamin B12 levels in the bloodstream.\n\nBefore injections of the vitamin became available the condition could even prove fatal.\n\nYour regular injections of vitamin B12 (in the form of cyanocobalamin or hydroxocobalamin) will have topped up your liver stores of the vitamin over time.\n\nBut rather than watch and wait and retest your blood level periodically, it would be simpler and less expensive to continue to give the injections at least twice a year.\n\nRegular injections of vitamin B12 (in the form of cyanocobalamin or hydroxocobalamin) will have topped up your liver's stores of the vitamin over time\n\nIt remains unclear to me why your doctor decided to review your diagnosis, unless there is an extra factor in your history that I don\u2019t know about \u2014 perhaps you used to have a vegan diet but now eat animal products again, for example.\n\nBut if that were the case you would not have been given a formal diagnosis of pernicious anaemia.", "description": "This is where someone pulls, twists or plucks their hair in a repetitive way, leading to traction alopecia \u2014 patches of obvious hair loss as a result of the hair being pulled under strain, says Dr Martin Scurr.", "authors": ["Martin Scurr For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/08/30/00/37AF07BB00000578-0-image-a-16_1472514675538.jpg", "published_at": "2016-08-29"}
