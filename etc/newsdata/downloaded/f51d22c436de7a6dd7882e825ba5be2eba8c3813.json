Instead, company officials say, they want to help law enforcement officers become more familiar with using empathy to resolve emergency situations when confusion is high and verbal commands lose their effectiveness. To aid in that goal, Axon has released \u201cempathy development training\u201d based in virtual reality.\n\nIn recent months, the company has unveiled similar virtual training \u2014 using Oculus Go virtual reality headsets \u2014 to prepare first responders for scenarios involving people with autism and schizophrenia. The latest virtual training is focused on suicide prevention.\n\n\u201cThe ability to tell the difference between someone who\u2019s acting in an unusual way that may be due to their autism versus someone who could be a risk to you can be a really fine line,\u201d David Kearon of the advocacy group Autism Speaks told the Associated Press in May. \u201cWhen you\u2019re trying to make that judgment very quickly, that\u2019s where we see mistakes made.\u201d\n\nToday, Axon announced its new empathy development training for suicide prevention based in #VR . The training will be made available to agencies in recognition of #WorldSuicidePreventionMonth.

Long popular with gamers drawn to immersive fantasy worlds, VR headsets are increasingly being used by scientists, doctors and the military.\n\nLast year, biology students at Arizona State University were given the option of purchasing $400 Lenovo Mirage Solo headsets to complete a biology course that incorporated simulated lab environments.\n\nMore recently, Walmart \u2014 the nation\u2019s largest employer \u2014 has begun replacing paper-based assessments with tests based in virtual simulations. Using a $250 Oculus Go virtual reality headset, employees have their wits and instincts tested inside a simulated environment, allowing managers to see how well they know the store\u2019s departments and how they react in everyday scenarios, according to the company.\n\nWalmart has added virtual reality to its assessment of an employee\u2019s potential\n\nIn its use of empathy training scenarios, in particular, law enforcement is beginning to view virtual reality as a useful tool. In the future, experts say, virtual reality could be used to review body-camera evidence, recruit new officers, conduct weapons training or be used as a therapy tool for officers suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nUsing virtual reality to enhance empathy and awareness is not entirely new. The Weather Channel has used immersive mixed-reality technology to impress upon people the importance of evacuating ahead of a hurricane, using terrifying imagery to deliver lifesaving information they might otherwise ignore.\n\nAt the Tribeca Film Festival last year, filmmakers debuted \u201c1000 Cut Journey,\u201d a virtual reality experience in which the viewer takes on the role of Michael Sterling, a black man who experiences racism at different points in his life. (It was created in concert with Courtney Cogburn, a Columbia University researcher who oversaw the social science aspects.)\n\nTo develop their suicide prevention training, Axon turned to clinicians, behavioral analysts and law enforcement experts to design an immersive experience that places trainees in a realistic scenario involving a mental-health crisis, the company said. In addition to having users hear the thoughts of a suicidal individual, the scenario allows them to make critical decisions about how to engage with the simulation, such as reassuring the troubled subject, asking about their history or keeping the individual talking.\n\nOne solution for keeping traffic stops from turning violent: A robot that separates police officers from drivers\n\nWhen mental-health crises go awry, Brown said, it\u2019s often because officers are overwhelmed by fear and unable to control their biometric response or process information effectively.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve ever had to go onstage and give a speech in front of a big crowd and been overwhelmed by the moment, it\u2019s kind of like that,\u201d she said.\n\nOut of the 992 deadly police shootings in the United States in 2018, Axon notes, 213 of those fatally shot suffered from a mental illness.\n\nFatal Force, a multiyear Washington Post study cataloguing every fatal shooting nationwide by a police officer since 2016, reveals that at least 127 people suffering from mental illness have been fatally shot by police in 2019, or about 19 percent of all those fatally shot by police this year.\n\nEven when stun guns are deployed effectively, the weapons have been linked to numerous deaths, particularly when the devices are used to subdue the mentally ill.\n\nIdeally, an officer who is a member of a crisis intervention team (CIT) \u2014 a program in which officers are trained to identify and de-escalate mental-health crisis \u2014 would respond to situations like the one outlined in Axon\u2019s virtual training. But often, Brown said, officers may not suspect they\u2019re dealing with a mental-health crisis until they\u2019re at the scene. A suicidal person standing on the edge of a building \u2014 the scenario presented in the Axon\u2019s virtual training scenario \u2014 for example, might initially be reported as a trespassing call.\n\nIn the virtual scenario, Brown said, photo realism and being able to hear the pain in someone\u2019s voice helps trainees develop empathy.\n\n\u201cEmpathy is the ability to understand what someone else is feeling, and that means really understanding the context that they\u2019re in from a 360-degree perspective,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe\u2019re asking them to empathize with states of being that are some of the most stigmatized and judged in our culture.\u201d\n\nMORE READING:\n\nHyundai\u2019s solution for navigating traffic-clogged cities: Mounting an electric scooter on your car\n\nZum, a ride-hailing company for kids, expands to six more U.S. cities, including D.C.\n\nThis Tesla owner wanted to control her Model 3.
