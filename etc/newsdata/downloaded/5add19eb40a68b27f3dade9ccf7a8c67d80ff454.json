That lifted total exports of crude and products to nearly 9 million b/d.\n\nAt the same time, Saudi Arabia cut back on both crude and refined product exports.\n\nThe oil-rich kingdom reclaimed the top spot in July and August, as the U.S. was affected by hurricane disruptions. The ongoing trade dispute also made it difficult for U.S. shale shipments to find markets in recent months, the IEA said.", "description": "The International Energy Agency (IEA) expects the U.S. to challenge Saudi Arabia's position as the world's leading oil exporter.", "authors": ["Sam Meredith"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105420546-1535476108058rts1z00b.jpg?v=1535476234", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
