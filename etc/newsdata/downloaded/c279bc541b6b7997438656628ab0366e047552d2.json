Hoyer and Pelosi then left the meeting, followed by Schumer shortly after.\n\nAs they left, Trump said: \"Goodbye, we'll see you at the polls.\"\n\nTrump also questioned Pelosi's opposition to ISIS at one point, according to the Democratic aide.\n\n\n\n\"I hate ISIS more than you do,\" Trump said to Pelosi.\n\n\"You don't know that,\" Pelosi replied.\n\n\n\n\"Does that mean we can't have future meetings? No. Just depends on the subject, I guess. Does it mean we can't pass things working together? If we can, we will,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\"But there has to be some level of values, of calmness, of patriotism, a love of our country and our system, and not a personal invective because he didn't like the way a vote went on any given day,\" Pelosi said.\n\n\n\nBrett Samuels contributed. Pelosi dismissed the notion that Democrats cannot work with Trump given the track record of meetings that have ended in blowups.\n\n-- Updated at 6:15 p.m.", "description": "Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said that \"we have to pray\" for President Trump's health after what she described as a \"meltdown\" during a meeting at the White House on Wednesday, marking an escalation in her depiction of\u00a0the commander in c", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/pelosinancy_101619gn2_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
