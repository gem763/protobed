Different fringe groups seized upon the murder to advance unproven theories that he was involved in the WikiLeaks hack. Right-wing outlets including Breitbart and The Drudge Report suggested with items and links that Rich could have been killed in retribution for the leak of DNC emails during last year\u2019s presidential campaign, an act that has largely been attributed to Russian interference. That theory about Rich\u2019s murder, which remains unsolved has yet to be proven. Theories around Rich helped fill segments on \u201cHannity,\u201d Fox News 10 p.m. primetime mainstay.\n\nThe Rich family has claimed Fox News reporter Malia Zimmerman and guest Ed Butowsky prevailed upon them to hire private investigator Rod Wheeler to probe Rich\u2019s death. They allege the two Fox News operatives then used that connection to the lend ballast to \u201cfalse accusations\u201d about him. Fox News in 2017 retracted a story by Zimmerman it had published on Rich\u2019s murder, noting at the time that it was \u201cnot initially subjected to [a] high degree of editorial scrutiny.\u201d\n\nThe retraction was believed to be one of the first made of a Fox News story.\n\nIn a statement, Fox News said the new ruling \u201cpermits Mr. and Mrs. Rich to proceed with discovery to determine whether there is a factual basis for their claims against Fox News. And while we extend the Rich family our deepest condolences for their loss, we believe that discovery will demonstrate that Fox News did not engage in conduct that will support the Riches\u2019 claims. We will be evaluating our next legal steps.\u201d\n\nThe Riches said in a statement that they \u201clook forward to continuing to pursue justice,\u201d adding \u201cWe would not wish what we have experienced upon any other parent \u2013 anywhere.\u201d\n\nSign up for Variety\u2019s Newsletter.
