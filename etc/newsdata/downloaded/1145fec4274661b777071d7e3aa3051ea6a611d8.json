This old Volvo FL6 box lorry has been painted by Banksy, and as such is now expected to fetch between \u00a31-1.5million when it goes under the hammer at the Bonhams Goodwood Revival sale in September. Crikey.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the Volvo is Banksy\u2019s largest-ever piece of work thanks to its surface area of 80 square metres. However, it was also painted way back in 2000 \u2013 a good six years before the street-artist really became a household name.\n\nThe story goes that Banksy \u2013 whomever he may be \u2013 was celebrating the turn of the millennium at a party on a Spanish hillside when he was presented with the FL6. The commissioner was Mojo - the co-founder of an international circus known as Turbozone \u2013 who wanted some slightly more conspicuous transport for his show. Apparently, Banksy set to work that same night, eventually finishing the job after a couple of weeks.\n\nWe can see why it took so long - there\u2019s a whole lot going on in his artwork. Most prominently, there\u2019s a man swinging a big hammer, lots of flying monkeys, some soldiers running away from a cannon and what looks like a broken road sign with a cow on it. We can only apologise to the art correspondents of the world \u2013 we don\u2019t usually do stuff like this.\n\nStill, when it goes up for sale the Volvo will be accompanied by a Certificate of Authentication issued by Pest Control, Banksy\u2019s studio, so at least you\u2019ll know it was \u00a31m well spent.
