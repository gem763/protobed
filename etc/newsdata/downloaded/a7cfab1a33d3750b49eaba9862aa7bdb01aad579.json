Now, Democrats are putting forward a plan to keep chaos to a minimum when the process eventually goes public.\n\nDemocrats unveiled rules for the House impeachment inquiry that put the House Intelligence Committee in the driver\u2019s seat. They hope this process will help them make a clear, public case that Trump abused his office by pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political enemies.\n\nTo that end, they\u2019re allowing for witnesses to be questioned by dedicated House attorneys first, before the members of Congress jump in. And while these new rules give House Republicans the right to subpoena their own witnesses, any GOP subpoena will have to get the House intel committee\u2019s Democratic chairman\u2019s approval.\n\n\"If they want to make it into a goat rodeo, we\u2019re not going to give them the rope to do that\u201d\n\nThose terms are meant to limit the ability of the GOP to pull the proceedings away from Trump\u2019s attempt to pressure Ukraine and tilt the focus onto tangential narratives that might be more politically beneficial to Trump \u2014 such as an examination of Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter\u2019s business activities in Ukraine.\n\n\"If they want to make it into a goat rodeo, we\u2019re not going to give them the rope to do that,\u201d Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.), a member of House Democratic leadership, told VICE News shortly before the rules package was released. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep this focused on what this should be focused on.\u201d\n\nTrick or Tradition?\n\nRep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), one of Trump\u2019s most vocal defenders in Congress, slammed the new rules as \u201ca joke,\u201d and accused Democrats of bad faith.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve had this make-it-up-as-you-go-along process that denies us all kinds of rights,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cThey kind of put a bow on it and called it a resolution.\u201d\n\nBut historians and experts on past impeachment fights told VICE News that the rules Democrats proposed appear steeped in impeachment tradition. The effective veto by the majority over subpoena requests from the minority party, for example, reflects similar arrangements during the impeachment proceedings of both former presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton.\n\n\u201cThe Nixon rules for the Judiciary Committee provided the same basic process\u201d for issuing subpoenas, said Frank Bowman, author of High Crimes and Misdemeanors: A History of Impeachment for the Age of Trump.\n\nIf the Democratic chair vetoes a Republican subpoena request, the GOP ranking member could theoretically override the veto with a majority vote by the committee \u2014 though that would require Democratic defections to Trump\u2019s team.\n\nRead: Trump's Already Freaking Out Over Today's Impeachment Testimony. This Week's Star Witness Hasn't Even Testified Yet.\n\n\n\nCongressional experts who spoke with VICE News hailed another new provision: Staff-led questioning.\n\nHouse hearings traditionally give each member a five-minute window to ask questions \u2014 leading to complaints of grand-standing, lengthy questions, and disjointed rounds of dialogue that leave plenty of room for clever witnesses to avoid answering questions altogether.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s impeachment hearings, like those of Nixon and Clinton, will put members of Congress in the back seat.\n\nStaff attorneys for either party will kick off witness interviews with uninterrupted, alternating 45-minute blocks of interrogation, before turning the session back over to the career politicians for their five minutes of questioning.\n\n\u201cThis is critical,\u201d said Nick Akerman, a member of the Nixon-era Watergate prosecution team. \u201cOtherwise, it gets totally disjointed and meaningless.\u201d\n\nHouse Republicans aren't convinced, however. Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.), a vocal Trump defender who sits on the Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters that the new rules were too little, too late.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t say anything about the minority party being guaranteed that we\u2019ll be able to call witnesses,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a missed opportunity. A resolution, drafted correctly, should have been done weeks ago.\u201d\n\nBut Democrats argue there\u2019s just no pleasing Republicans aimed at sticking by Trump through thick and thin.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s pretty good evidence that these guys don\u2019t care about any of the facts,\u201d Rep. Kildee said. \u201cThey can\u2019t even accept as a fact something that the president has already acknowledged. So the idea that suddenly we're going to turn the keys over to them \u2014 they're not in the majority. We are.\"\n\nCover: Rep.
