The actress and activist was among the first to accuse the Hollywood producer of rape in 2017. She has since become a vocal, powerful presence in the #MeToo movement.\n\nMcGowan claims that once Weinstein and his legal team, specifically lawyers David Boies and Lisa Bloom, discovered in 2016 that the actress was writing a book detailing the alleged sexual assault, they tried to ensure it was never published. The suit also alleges that Weinstein hired private intelligence firm Black Cube to obtain information on the book by posing as an advocate for women.\n\nBrave was eventually published in 2018.\n\n\"This case is about a diabolical and illegal effort by one of America's most powerful men and his representatives to silence sexual-assault victims,\" says the lawsuit. \"And it is about the courageous women and journalists who persisted to reveal the truth.\"\n\nEric George, attorney for Bloom, denied the allegations.\n\n\"There is simply no credible factual or legal basis for her claims against my client,\" George told AFP news agency. \"We look forward to our day in court to set the record straight.\"\n\nWeinstein - who has denied all rape accusations against him - says the latest allegation is \"baseless\".\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "The actress and activist was among the first to accuse the producer of rape in 2017", "authors": ["The Editors"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MIxReROok6x0wtt4HEcuiw--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/harper_s_bazaar_111/3f4b4dd9921767a8d44683e226eed2a0", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
