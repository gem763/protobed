One of the recommendations was to end automatic release at the halfway point of a sentence for the most serious offenders.\n\nThe change will apply to people who are convicted of crimes carrying a maximum of sentence of life in prison, including murder, rape and grievous bodily harm, and who are sentenced to at least four years in prison.\u200b\u200b\n\nMr Buckland is expected to tell the conference in Manchester: \u201cWe\u2019re going to restore faith in the sentencing system, because we Conservatives believe release should be earned.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why, for the most serious violent and sexual offenders, I\u2019m announcing this Conservative government wil abolish automatic early release at the halfway point. These criminals will be required to serve two-thirds of their sentence behind bars.\"\n\nHe will continue: \u201cBecause keeping the most dangerous violent and sexual offenders in prison for longer means they won\u2019t be out on the streets with the opportunity to commit crime. We owe it to victims to make this change.\n\n\u201cPunishment and rehabilitation are not opposites. We have to do both. Conservatives believe in offering a second chance to those who are ready to change. Prisons simply cannot be giant academies of crime. So we will do more to improve rehabilitation in prison, and support our probation services in their vital work to supervise and resettle former prisoners.\u201d\n\nMs Patel is expected to emphasise the new hardline approach in her own speech later on Tuesday.", "description": "Murderers\u00a0and rapists will no longer\u00a0be eligible for release halfway through their prison sentences under new plans to be unveiled by the government on Tuesday.
