That really says where Manchester United are at this minute in time.\"\n\nUnited have been left short of attacking players after Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez were not replaced in the summer, with recent injuries to Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial severely limiting the team's goal threat.", "description": "Winger is United's 'main man' - but former defender says James shouldn't have to shoulder that responsibility yet", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Alex Livesey", "Bt Sports"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20204141.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Manchester-United-v-Rochdale-AFC-Carabao-Cup-Third-Round.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
