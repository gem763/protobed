The missiles and drones used also resemble Iranian-made weapons, though analysts say more study is needed to definitively link them to Iran.\n\nA Saudi-led coalition has battled the Houthis since March 2015 in a bloody and stalemated war.\n\nKuwait's state-run KUNA news agency published the port decision Friday, quoting Kuwait's minister of commerce and industry as making the announcement. Khaled al-Roudhan said the decision affected both commercial ports and oil facilities.\n\nSaudi Arabia also flew journalists to its Khurais oil field Friday to see the damage from the attack. The oil field is believed to produce over 1 million barrels of crude oil a day. It has estimated reserves of over 20 billion barrels of oil, according to Aramco.\n\nIRANIAN CRUISE MISSILES AND DRONES USED IN SAUDI OIL FACILITIES, US OFFICIALS SAY\n\nOfficials said 110 contractors evacuated the site after the attack, but there were no injuries. They told journalists the oil field was back online within 24 hours of the attack.\n\nAn oil stabilization tower could be seen to be damaged by the attack, standing charred in the heat of Friday afternoon in the Saudi desert. Other pipes bore holes from damage in the attack.\n\nThe Abqaiq facility processes sour crude oil into sweet crude, then transports it onto transshipment points on the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea or to refineries for local production. Estimates suggest it can process up to 7 million barrels of crude oil a day. By comparison, Saudi Arabia produced 9.65 million barrels of crude oil a day in July.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe plant has been targeted in the past by militants. Al Qaeda-claimed suicide bombers tried but failed to attack the oil complex in February 2006.", "description": "Saudi Arabia took journalists on Friday to the site of a missile-and-drone strike on the kingdom's oil industry that shook global energy markets over the weekend.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/AP19263377174069.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
