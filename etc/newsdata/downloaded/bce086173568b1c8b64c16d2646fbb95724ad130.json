From this evening until sunset on Wednesday night (9 October)\n\nWhat\u2019s it about? Aka the Day Of Atonement, Jewish people refrain from food and drink for 25 hours and spend the day in prayer and reflection, asking for forgiveness for their sins in the past year and pledging to do better in the year to come.\n\nSukkot\n\nSukkot sees people leaving their homes to dwell in custom-built booths like this one (Picture: Reuters)\n\nWhen is it? Starts at sundown on Sunday night (13 October) until the following Sunday evening (20 October)\n\nWhat\u2019s it about? Also known as Tabernacles, Sukkot is a harvest festival during which people eat, drink and pray in a sukkah, a specially constructed outdoor booth with a roof made of vegetation which allows subnlight to pass through. Although some Jewish people also sleep in their sukkah during this week it\u2019s less common in countries such as the UK where the weather is colder at this time of year.\n\nThe festival begins with two days of Yom Tov \u2013 festive days during which work is forbidden \u2013 followed by four intermediate days known as Chol Hamoed, during which work and normal activities can be resumed.\n\nOther customs during this week include praying over a special bundle of plants and fruit \u2013 known as the Four Kinds \u2013 consisting of a palm branch, willow, myrtle and a lemon-like citrus fruit called an Etrog. It is said that these represent the four types of Jewish people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe seventh day of Sukkot is known as Hoshanah Rabbah, which offers a final chance for repentance following Yom Kippur \u2013 with a special service held in synagogue to mark this.\n\nShemini Atzeret\n\nShemini Atzeret involves praying for rain (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nWhen is it? Starts at sundown on 20 October and ends at sundown on Monday 21 October\n\nWhat\u2019s it about? Technically the eighth day of Sukkot, Shemini Atzeret is a Yom Tov (festive) day during which the synagogue service includes a special prayer for rain.\n\nSimchat Torah\n\nYes, this can happen in synagogue (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nWhen is it? Starts at sundown on Monday 21 October and ends at sundown on Tuesday 22 October\n\nWhat\u2019s it about? After the solemnity of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, Simchat Torah (the Rejoicing Of The Law) offers a chance to let one\u2019s hair down and have a little fun. The festival celebrates the conclusion of the reading of the Torah (i.e the first five books of the Old Testament) in synagogue and the start of reading it again from the beginning (with a portion from one of the books reading in synagogue every Sabbath).\n\nThis effectively provides a great excuse for a big party \u2013 with an evening service in which seven circuits of the synagogue are made carrying the Torah scrolls, interspersed with singing, dancing and general merriment \u2013 not to mention copious amounts of food and alcohol, plus flags and sweets for children.\n\nThere\u2019s more of the same the following morning \u2013 with the odd prank liable to pop up before the service is over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHanukkah\n\nHanukkah is the Festival of Lights \u2013 and there are plenty of those (Picture: Getty)\n\nWhen is it? This year Hanukkah begins at sundown on Sunday 22 December and runs until Monday 30 December.\n\nWhat\u2019s it about? Hanukkah \u2013 aka the Festival of Lights \u2013 commemorates the story of the Maccabees, who saved the Jewish people from their Greek-Syrian oppressors in the era of the Second Temple. The story goes that following their rebellion the eternal light in the temple was left with only enough oil to remain alight for a day \u2013 until a miracle occurred and it remained alight for eight days until more oil could be found to keep it going.\n\nThe main tradition of the festival is to light candles every night on a special eight-branched candelabra known as a Menorah \u2013 adding one more candle each day until the final night. It\u2019s also a big time of year for parties and presents, while food fried in oil, such as latkes (potato pancakes) and doughnuts are traditionally eaten.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
