(Getty Images)\n\nNEW YORK \u2013 The slightly drooping right eye and the small bump on the side of her nose are the only outward signs that Geoffrey Jacobson\u2019s daughter\u2019s face was once on the receiving end of a 106-mph line drive off the bat of a major-league baseball player.\n\nBesides, Jacobson says, \u201cIt\u2019s only something a father or mother would notice, because we knew how it was before.\u201d\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe psychic scars may take longer to heal, however.\n\nThe little girl has no clear memory of that day two years ago in Yankee Stadium, when a foul ball hit by Todd Frazier in the fifth inning of a game between the Yankees and Twins homed in on her before her grandfather, in whose arms she was cradled, could stop it from slamming into her forehead.\n\nThe ball came so fast the fan sitting next to them picked it up without realizing it had hit anyone.\n\nBut somewhere in the little girl\u2019s memory, that nightmare image still lives; at a recent dinner party with her parents, she walked in carrying a doll. She was pressing an icepack to its forehead.\n\n\u201cDolly got hit by a baseball,\u201d she said, stunning the other guests in an awkward silence.\n\nIf the sight of a then 2-year-old girl nearly getting killed by a baseball \u2014 a sight that hushed Yankee Stadium and had Frazier, along with his teammate Matt Holliday, Yankees third base coach Joe Espada and Twins third baseman Eduardo Escobar kneeling in prayer and near tears \u2014 wasn\u2019t enough to spur MLB to force its teams to extend the safety nettings in their ballparks from foul pole to foul pole, it\u2019s tough to imagine what would be.\n\nAnd if what happened to the Jacobson girl \u2014 her family has withheld the publishing of her first name to protect her privacy \u2014 wasn\u2019t enough, what happened at Minute Maid Park in Houston in May certainly should have been.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn a strikingly similar incident, a line drive hit by Albert Almora Jr. of the Cubs struck a 2-year-old girl in the head. She suffered skull fractures and bleeding on the brain and has had seizures as a result of her injuries. Her family has not been identified publicly and calls to her lawyer for comment were not returned.\n\nAnd yet, only 11 teams have \u2014 or at least announced their intention \u2014 extended netting beyond the ends of the dugouts and into the outfield, a seating area which in an era of juiced baseballs, flame-throwing pitchers and all-or-nothing swingers has turned into a veritable kill zone for fans. The rest sit silently, following the lead of MLB commissioner Rob Manfred, who has dragged his feet, preferring to leave the matter in the hands of the individual teams.\n\nThe reason baseball can adopt such a policy is because of the so-called \u201cBaseball Rule,\u201d a court judgment handed down in 1913 by a Missouri appellate court, which ruled that S.J. Crane, a spectator who suffered broken ribs from a foul ball during an American Association game, was not entitled to his request for $100 in medical expenses from the team because he chose to sit in an unprotected area of the ballpark.\n\nThe Chicago White Sox were the first team to install extended protective netting. The netting at Guaranteed Rate Field runs from the ends of each dugout down to the foul poles on each side of the field of play. (Getty Images)\n\nSince then, virtually every fan who has attempted to sue a ball club for injuries suffered during a game has fallen victim to that precedent. The disclaimer printed on the back of every ticket and posted throughout every ballpark that states fans are responsible for their own safety from thrown or batted balls has effectively indemnified baseball owners for 105 years now.\n\nThe rule has been challenged numerous times, most recently in New York by Andrew Zlotnick, a Yankee fan who was blinded in one eye by a foul ball that whistled through a thicket of umbrellas on a rainy night at Yankee Stadium, preventing him from seeing the ball or taking defensive measures. After a seven-year battle through the courts, Zlotnick\u2019s case was tossed by the N.Y. Court of Appeals last year.\n\nThat has not stopped Zlotnick, an attorney, from continuing to fight for the overturning of the Baseball Rule.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s not about the money, it\u2019s about seeking justice and making sure the next guy who sits in my seat doesn\u2019t get hurt like I did,\u201d Zlotnick said. \u201cI have pain every waking moment of every day. I can\u2019t heal the wound but I can try to help others not have to suffer the way I did.\u201d\n\nAfter first offering to reimburse Zlotnick\u2019s medical expenses, the Yankees later changed their minds, and went to war against him with an army of lawyers. In the Jacobson case, however, the team has reimbursed the family for out-of-pocket costs estimated by Geoffrey Jacobson at $4,000.\n\n\u201cAt first, they offered me memorabilia and crap like that,\u201d Jacobson said. \u201cI said no thanks. But they have kept their word on the expenses.\u201d\n\nBy the start of the 2018 season, the Yankees \u2014 who had been resistant to extending their netting for fear of alienating the fans who pay for their high-priced field-level seats \u2014 installed netting more than halfway into their outfield, to the section of the ballpark where the seats angle back from the field, ostensibly out of harm\u2019s way.\n\nYankee executives said the delay was due to the need for the architects who designed their ballpark to come up with an effective way to string the netting so as to cause minimal distraction to their fans. However, the Mets, their crosstown rivals, were able to extend the netting at Citi Field into the outfield during the 2017 All-Star break.\n\nIn the two years since that terrifying day at Yankee Stadium, Jacobson says his daughter has made a nearly complete recovery. The vision in her right eye, so severely damaged by the impact that she had to wear an eye patch for months, has returned to \u201can almost acceptable level.\u201d She is periodically monitored for cerebral events such as \u201cabsence seizures,\u201d in which a child may zone out due to lingering brain injury. And there remains the possibility that as she gets older, her slight facial deformities may worsen to the point that they may require surgery.\n\nStill, Jacobson considers his daughter to have been extraordinarily lucky.\n\n\u201cAn inch to the right or the left, it could have been very different,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause she\u2019s so young, she probably healed better than an older person might have. I have no doubt that if that ball had hit either of my parents, they would have died.\u201d\n\nJacobson said the first anniversary of his daughter\u2019s injury last September was hard enough to face. But in light of the similarity of the incident in Houston \u2014 Jacobson\u2019s daughter also suffered a fractured nose, a crushed orbital bone and bleeding on the brain \u2014 makes this one even more difficult.\n\n\u201cIn light of what happened in Houston, it feels as fresh now as it did then,\u201d he said. \u201cThis whole ordeal has been the worst time in my family\u2019s lives. The second-worst time was hearing that another little girl was hurt.\u201d\n\nAlthough Jacobson has returned to Yankee Stadium, once to sit in the same seats his daughter and parents had occupied to see if they were now protected by netting \u2014 they are \u2014 he says it will be a long time before he takes his daughter or her 6-year-old brother to another ballgame.\n\n\u201cRight now, my wife and I won\u2019t even consider that, and if we ever do, it will be behind netting or in a box behind glass,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to enjoy the game now. Whenever a ball goes into the stands, I\u2019m looking to see if it hit someone else\u2019s kid. And when I heard about the girl in Houston, all I could think of was, could I have done something to prevent it?\n\n\u201cBut really, the teams that actually have control over the situation are the ones that should be asking that question. Shouldn't they?\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "It's been two years since a little girl was hit in the head by a foul ball at Yankee Stadium, and yet only 11 MLB teams have installed or committed to installing protective netting.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/48jIwZ_zHo0TqJbsAJkLtg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4EmytqALC.1sMVbMRp6j7Q--~B/aD0zMDQxO3c9NDU2MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/808dea30-db33-11e9-adef-213c95d3c499", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
