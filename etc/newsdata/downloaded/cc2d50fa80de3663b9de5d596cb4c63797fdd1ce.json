He is not currently on Forbes' list of 400 wealthiest Americans.\n\nLinda is an avid art collector, according to the report, and an honorary trustee at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nThe longtime couples' split was first announced in 2016, around the same time Macklowe was reported to be having an affair with French businesswoman Patricia Landeau. In March of this year, Macklowe plastered a picture of himself and Landeau on the side of one of the buildings he owned. The couple wed just days later.\n\nBoth Macklowes enlisted independent art experts to estimate the value of their art.
