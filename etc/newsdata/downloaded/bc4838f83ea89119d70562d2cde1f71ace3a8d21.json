By gradually getting accustomed to the taste of our own flesh, he added, humans might come to view cannibalism as less taboo.\n\nS\u00f6derlund, a behavioral scientist at the Stockholm School of Economics, doesn't research nutrition science or the economics of our global food supply. He studies psychological reactions, like the audible groan from attendees when they were asked whether they'd consider eating a corpse.\n\n\"I'd be open to at least tasting it,\" S\u00f6derlund later told the State Swedish Television channel TV4.\n\nRead more: Nibbled-on bones found in a cave revealed that our Neanderthal ancestors ate each other. Scientists may have figured out why.\n\nThe idea of using cannibalism to supplement our food supply isn't new. In 2018, evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins wondered if it would be possible to grow meat from harvested human cells in a laboratory.\n\nLike S\u00f6derlund, he called the idea \"an interesting test case\" that might demonstrate whether humans could overcome the \"yuck\" factor in order to do something they considered moral, like reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.\n\nBut of course, the suggestion of cannibalism is rife with problems. Genevieve Guenther, director of End Climate Silence, a nonprofit that advocates for more representation of climate change in the media, told Business Insider that \"to suggest that cannibalism is a solution to climate change is about as bad as climate denial itself.\"\n\nShe added: \"I don't think that it should be even entertained in any seriousness, but exposed as a kind of propaganda that only makes it harder for us to transform the world in the ways that we need to.\"\n\n'Our whole culture would descend into barbarism'\n\nFILE PHOTO: Corn is loaded into a truck at a farm in Tiskilwa, Illinois, U.S., July 6, 2018.

As climate-related disasters like floods, droughts, and extreme heat continue to get more frequent and extreme, agricultural producers will find it more difficult to grow crops. In less than a decade, the world could fall short of feeding every person on the planet by 214 trillion calories per year, or about 28,000 calories per person.\n\nS\u00f6derlund's suggestion involves removing flesh from a corpse and serving it to humans, while Dawkins raised the possibility of taking stem cells from a living human, culturing them in a lab, and allowing the mature cells to grow into meat.\n\nBut there are myriad ethical problems to consider with either of these options, of course.\n\n\"The idea that we would be able to administer this in any kind of rational, systemic way is so absurd,\" Guenther said. \"It would mean our whole culture would descend into barbarism.\"\n\nPlus, there are many more straightforward, less grotesque ways to ensure we have enough food in the future.", "description": "As our food supply faces more stress, behavioral scientist Magnus S\u00f6derlund said, humans might consider eating corpses.", "authors": ["Aria Bendix"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/AUUVOoo4rW0Z9kjuwtCotg--~B/aD0xNDUwO3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/011fb636d3637d0dd504c364252a3638", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
