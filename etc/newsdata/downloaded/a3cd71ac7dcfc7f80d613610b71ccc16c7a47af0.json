The group criticized the move because Oppenheim is at the center of a controversy involving allegations of sexual assault relating to Harvey Weinstein and Matt Lauer.\n\nThe group said in a statement that the contract renewal was \u2018a big mistake\u2019 and called Oppenheim a \u2018top executive that enabled abusers and silenced survivors.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is deeply disturbing that Comcast CEO Brian Roberts would show such poor judgment and renew its contract with Noah Oppenheim knowing full well that he was facing allegations of enabling sexual abusers in the workplace and had a record of silencing survivors and stories of survivors in the newsroom,\u201d said Shauna Thomas, executive director and co-founder of Ultra Violet.\n\n\u201cThe rot at Comcast clearly goes to the top \u2013 with the media giant caring more about short-term profits than about protecting its employees and safeguarding long-term shareholder value.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a mistake that Comcast and NBC Universal will regret,\u201d Thomas said.\n\nFormer media mogul Weinstein and NBC News anchor Lauer are accused of serious acts of sexual assault. It is alleged that Oppenheim and other NBC executives interfered in the reporting of allegations against Weinstein and knew about Lauer\u2019s behavior. NBC executives have denied this.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nLinkedIn\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nPinterest\n\nTumblr\n\n", "description": "\"This is a mistake that Comcast and NBC Universal will regret\"", "authors": ["Darragh Roche Is Senior Editor", "Political News Writer."], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/contemptor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/noah.jpg?fit=1200%2C675&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
