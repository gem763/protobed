The idea came from cofounder and CEO Drew Sterrett's experience in private equity.\n\n\"How do you have the largest asset in the world and there is no liquid and transparent market behind it?\" Sterrett said.\n\nCommercial real estate is seen as a relatively illiquid investment, as properties usually have to be sold in full for the owner to recoup any cash. LEX instead is looking to securitize the equity in the building into partnership interests priced at $100 each that can be traded on its market.\n\nThe marketplace, by bringing real estate investment to non-accredited investors, drastically increases the reporting and regulatory load that LEX has to burden before opening it up. Sterrett said that it has looked to avoid startup tech's famous \"move fast and break things\" motto.\n\n\"We don't believe in fixing it later,\" Sterrett said.\n\nSee also: Divvy, a rent-to-own startup for homeowners, grabs $43 million in fresh funding \u2014 including from home-building giant Lennar\n\nSterrett said that the decision to open up LEX to non-accredited investors is intended to increase the liquidity of the equity in a building.\n\nHe used the example of a traditional partnership with five partners. If one were to leave, they'd need to find another partner or outside investors to buy their share. If there are hundreds of partners with different-sized stakes in the property, it becomes easier to unload those shares to a larger field of potential investors, which Sterrett hopes includes traditional institutional and high-net worth investors as well as non-accredited investors.\n\nSmaller investors are often not as well-versed in real estate investing, but Sterrett says that LEX has \"tried to diminish as much risk as possible.\" LEX says it will only recapitalize \"stabilized commercial real estate\" and has no plans at this time to delve into the riskier world of debt-financing acquisitions or new developments.", "description": "LEX is building a market for both accredited and non-accredited investors to invest in the equity of a building.", "authors": ["Alex Nicoll"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d93c7f22e22af692542bdc6?width=1200&format=jpeg"}
