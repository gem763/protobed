It focused on the integumentary system \u2014 the organ system comprised of the skin, hair, nails and glands. For Cisse, the lecture went beyond biology.\n\nCisse said she wanted her student to focus on the meaning of the lecture, a task often difficult in a three-hour class, but made even more challenging when notetaking has to be balanced with holding a child.\n\nSo Cisse told the student to hand her the child. She would hold him so that the student could just pay attention. Cisse, a mother of three, said she raised her children at the same time she attended graduate school.\n\n\"I just wanted her to be a student, a normal young student in the class,\" Cisse said. \"I didn't want her to think about the baby.\"\n\n\"I wanted the student to have a little break.\"\n\nCisse carried the child for the entirety of the lecture, fashioning a sling out of a white lab jacket to hold him on her back, freeing her hands to write on the whiteboard. The child fell asleep almost immediately, Cisse said.\n\nSuch compassion is present in all people, Cisse said \u2014 just that, sometimes, it needs a bit of coaxing.\n\n\"I think the job of an educator is to give you the belief in yourself, to trust yourself and to get it out of you,\" Cisse said. \"So my job is to show them you have it already, you have what it takes to give to the world.\"\n\nCisse said the child provided a helpful teaching aid during her lecture. When it came time to feed the child, Cisse said she took a moment to explain metabolism.\n\n\"The mom gave me the milk, but it was kind of cold. So I told the mommy to warm it a little bit, to be his body temperature. And they said, 'Why does it have to be warm?', and I said it has to be his body temperature so that when he drinks the milk, he's not spending too much energy to warm up the milk.\"\n\n\"Energy is very important. The baby needs to grow. The taking, anabolism, and the breaking, catabolism, of nutrients coming into your body.\"\n\nCisse said she even managed to touch upon the nervous system's ability of recall, especially in a baby's brain.\n\n\"I told them, everything I'm telling you now, he can hear me. He may not understand what I'm saying, but one day he can grow up and be like, 'I heard this before!'\"\n\nWhile Cisse was teaching, she said the baby would nod when she would go over an important fact, as if giving his tiny stamp of approval to the lecture.\n\nOne of the students snapped a photo of the duo, which Cisse's daughter posted on Twitter, where it went viral.\n\nViral moments are, in their nature, fleeting. Cisse said that, in the time she has, before this moment fades and another one comes into the spotlight, she wants to impart a simple message to students.\n\n\"I want to make sure young people understand that we are here for them. We are here to support, to nurture, to guide, to love, to inspire, to teach, we are here for that. So I don't want them to give up on us. We're here. We take them very seriously.\"\n\nAlexander Tuerk is an intern at Here and Now.", "description": "\"We know it's overwhelming, don't think we don't understand,\" the professor said about the challenge of being a student and a parent. \"We take it very seriously, and we're going to be here for you.\"", "authors": ["Alexander Tuerk"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/include/images/facebook-default-wide.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
