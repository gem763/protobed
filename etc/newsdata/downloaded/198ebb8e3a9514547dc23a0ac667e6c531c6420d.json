It's a basic building block of life,\" Clugston said.\n\nPerhaps such comments are based on out-of-date thinking. That's not unreasonable, because the technology to make Layzell's plan cost effective has only recently begun to gel.\n\nAnd rather than abruptly ending oil and gas production and switching to a brand new disruptive business model, this set of innovations that have all arrived about the same time could set the Canadian fossil fuel economy on a gradual transition to an economy that produces almost no carbon at all.\n\nThe Canadian industry has focused on reducing the carbon intensity of oil and gas production. Clearly those are steps in the right direction.\n\nBesides the carbon produced when end users burn the final product, Canadian oil production, especially from the oilsands, uses a lot of fossil fuel in extraction and processing. (Todd Korol/Retuers)\n\nThe main reason people like Thunberg and investors like the Norway pension fund have objected to bitumen production is the high carbon cost of extracting the stuff, which in traditional methods requires the burning of huge quantities of another fossil fuel, natural gas. But there is a second problem.\n\nWhile cutting back on the amount of carbon dioxide produced in processing is constructive, fossil fuels generate another round of greenhouse gases during their ultimate combustion.\n\nWhen end users burn the fossil fuel, whether oil, gasoline, diesel or natural gas and whether for transportation, electric power or heat, it generates between two and three kilograms of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide per litre for the two liquid fuels we use in cars and trucks.\n\nPart of the power of the AZETEC energy system is that it avoids that final step. Rather than burning fossil fuels directly, creating combustion pollutants such as nitrous oxides and particulates plus carbon dioxide, the AZETEC trucks will use carbon-free hydrogen fuel manufactured from natural gas.\n\nNot just better but cheaper\n\nBut the magic that makes this plan work is that the cost of running a transport truck carbon-free is a fraction of the cost of the conventional alternative. Measured in units of energy, or gigajoules, the compelling business case is that the low-carbon substitute is significantly cheaper.\n\n\"The wholesale cost of making diesel fuel is about $19 per gigjoule or 75 cents a litre,\" said Layzell. \"The cost for us to make hydrogen is only about $10 or $11 a gigajoule. So we can actually make a zero-carbon fuel with very low carbon emissions \u2014 we'll put the carbon back in the ground \u2014 and we can do it at about half the price.\"\n\nOne of the innovations that makes this possible is the Alberta work done on carbon capture and storage, reliably and permanently injecting carbon dioxide into porous rock deep underground. Whereas the process has been difficult and costly when attempted on post-combustion CO2, as tried in Saskatchewan coal plants, trapping the concentrated carbon dioxide produced by the hydrogen-making process can be as cheap as $4 a gigajoule.\n\nDavid Layzell, director of Canadian Energy Systems Analysis Research (CESAR) at the University of Calgary, says Alberta should be producing the low-carbon fuels the world wants. (CESAR)\n\nNot only is the cost per unit of energy lower, the fuel cells used to turn hydrogen into electricity to run the truck engines are up to twice as energy efficient due to the same technologies that make battery and hybrid cars cheap to run.\n\nDespite the favourable economics, the AZETEC system has not proved itself yet. The trucks being produced by Ballard Power Systems, operated by Alberta trucking companies Trimac and Bison Transport, must survive their 18-month experiment.\n\nTo make fuel distribution cost-efficient will require about 50 trucks operating on Highway 2, using about five tonnes of hydrogen a day.\n\nBut if carbon-free transportation can be shown to work in the heart of Canada's oil country, in a Canadian climate, it is a technology that could reasonably conquer the world.\n\nOther sources of hydrogen, including from the oilsands and eventually from electrolysis when technology brings costs down, would allow the technology to spread from this highway to other roads and to other uses.\n\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis", "description": "Instead of criticizing Greta Thunberg, as Alberta's environment minister did, and pitting its economy against efforts to reduce carbon emissions, the province should be boasting about world-leading innovation in low-carbon trucking that's cheaper than diesel.", "authors": ["Business Columnist", "Don Pittis Was A Forest Firefighter", "A Ranger In Canada'S High Arctic Islands.
