A great admissions essay serves to humanize your application \u2014 so make sure you're highlighting who you are through what you've done.\n\n\"At the risk of sounding overly dramatic, the essays are the windows into your soul,\" Patrick Mullane, the executive director of Harvard Business School Online and an HBS graduate, told Business Insider. \"They are a chance to put a personality around the numbers that will make up much of an application.\"\n\nThe numbers show that business schools are inundated with top applicants who are all vying for the same seats. Harvard received 9,886 full-time applicants in the fall of 2018, and accepted 10.4% of those applications, or 1,031 students, according to US News. Stanford had 7,797 applicants for the same time frame and admitted 473 for an acceptance rate of 6.1%. Amidst these daunting numbers, the personality you display through your essay could be the factor that differentiates you from others.\n\nHarvard MBA grads say authenticity is key.\n\nThis personality shouldn't be contrived, however. Shaifali Aggarwal, a HBS graduate and the founder and CEO of Ivy Groupe, says her admittance was partly due to her authentic communication.\n\nShe surveyed her experiences in all settings, academic, personal, and professional, to find common strengths. Then, she connected the dots and talked specifically about examples related to those strengths in her application.\n\n\"To further differentiate myself,\" Aggarwal told Business Insider, \"I provided color on why some experiences were instrumental in shaping who I was and were meaningful to me.\"\n\nCompiling all of this takes time. But Kaneisha Grayson, a HBS grad and founder and CEO of The Art of Applying, thinks its time well spent. According to Grayson, creating a \"concise, compelling, and authentic representation\" of yourself through your essay by taking the time to thoughtfully construct it gives you an advantage.\n\n\"The essay is the part of your application process over which you have the most control,\" Grayson told Business Insider.\n\nYou can't follow someone else's path to get into Stanford.\n\nThe essay question, \"What matters to you most and why?\" is almost like asking, \"What's your life's purpose?\"\n\nSamantha Dong, Stanford alum and founder and CEO of Ally Shoes, said that attempting to answer this question was her biggest challenge when trying to get into Stanford. She wrote 20 different drafts of her essay before she was happy with the product. Something that helped her was reframing the question: She asked herself, what's the one thing in life I cannot live without?\n\nAddressing the life's purpose question with a cohesive answer means looking at your life and pulling out the threads of common experiences. Benjamin Fernandes, Stanford GSB alum and founder and CEO of NALA, says it also means breaking the mold of what you think has worked with admissions officers before.\n\n\"Admissions officers have read thousands of essays each year and could spot something being embellished from a mile away,\" Fernandes told Business Insider.\n\nWharton wants you to be specific about your career goals.\n\nIn essays, Wharton admissions officers want you to outline plans for how you plan to bridge what you're currently doing and where you want to go, and show them how they can help you build it. The essay shouldn't be \"manufactured,\" though, says Apu Gupta, Wharton alum and CEO of Curalate.\n\n\"I viewed the business school essays as an opportunity to connect the dots on what could otherwise seem like a bunch of disparate life experiences,\" Gupta told Business Insider.\n\nNithya Thadani, Wharton alum and CEO of RAIN, also spoke about connecting the dots with personal essays: Crafting a compelling story requires specificity taken from life experiences, and the potential role of the school itself.\n\n\"It's all about storytelling,\" said Thadani. \"The key is to own your narrative.\"\n\nResearch is key for Kellogg's video essays.\n\nYou have the opportunity to showcase your personality further with Kellogg's video essays. This involves recording video answers to three questions. Candidates are given 20 seconds of time to think of an answer, and up to a minute to communicate a response to each question.\n\n\"There is a tremendous opportunity to relay your Kellogg knowledge when asked,\" Renee Cherubin, an alum of the MBA program and the senior director of full-time admissions for the Kellogg School, told Business Insider, \"so do your research and be sure to demonstrate it where possible!\"\n\nThe \"Why Kellogg?\" question especially is a good place to communicate deep-rooted interest in the program. In this part, you can entwine your past experiences with your future aspirations, similar to what successful Wharton grads did with their written essays.\n\nMegha Kosaraju, Wharton alum and senior strategy and innovation fellow at Medtronic LABS, said: \"I recognized that this was my chance to make admissions' job easy for them by clearly laying out how Kellogg fit into my journey.\"", "description": "We talked to alums at Harvard, Stanford, Kellogg, and Wharton business schools to find what makes the best personal essays shine.", "authors": ["Sherin Shibu"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7936f32e22af0ddd488ac7-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
