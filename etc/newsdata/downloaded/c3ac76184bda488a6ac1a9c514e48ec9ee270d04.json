In 2017, Markle explained that casting directors were often confused, wondering whether she was \u201cLatina\u201d, \u201cSephardic\u201d or \u201cexotic Caucasian\u201d.\n\nRead more\n\nRoyal Tour: Meghan Markle wears patterned dress from ethical brand\n\nDuring her speech in Cape Town, the 38-year-old also spoke about her strong stance on feminism, sharing a quote from American poet Maya Angelou.\n\n\u201cEach time a woman stands up for herself, without knowing it possibly, without claiming it, she stands up for all women,\" Markle said.\n\nThe duchess later thanked some of the teenage girls she and Prince Harry had spoken to earlier in the day for being so \u201copen and honest\u201d about the dangers women face in Africa and how they are tackling them.\n\n\u201cThe rights of women and girls is something that's very close to my heart and a cause I've spent the majority of my life advocating for, because I know that when women are empowered, the entire community flourishes,\u201d Markle added.\n\n\"While I am here with my husband as a member of the Royal Family, I am here with you as a woman, as a wife, as a woman of colour and as your sister.\"\n\n\n\nThe Duchess of Sussex pic.twitter.com/o4zjTujsc5 \u2014 Omid Scobie (@scobie) September 23, 2019\n\n\u201dPlease know that my husband and I have been closely following what you've been experiencing here, as best as we can from afar.
