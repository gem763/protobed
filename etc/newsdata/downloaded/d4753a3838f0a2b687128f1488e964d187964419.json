Further, the bill seeks to force drug makers to pay rebates if the price of their product goes above the inflation rate.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTo be sure, a critical component of the Democrats\u2019 2020 policy narrative must and will be health care reform. This drug-pricing reform bill is a step in the wrong direction for Democrats, who already are struggling to unify their party around a cohesive health care policy and message.\n\nIf Democrats truly want to address problems associated with costs, and own this election narrative, they must reshape their focus to address the abuses happening in the drug-pricing supply chain.\n\nFor instance, pharmacy benefit managers are major cost drivers, increasing the cost of drugs by negotiating large rebates without passing the savings on to the patient. If rebates are going to be a tool to lower drug costs, they should be applied to the actual patients\u2019 out-of-pocket expenses, and there simply does not need to be a middle-man.\n\nPut another way, the Democrats\u2019 current drug plan will do patients more harm than good. At a time when House Democrats are fighting to re-deliver on their electoral majority \u2014 especially in suburban districts that flipped blue in 2018 \u2014 the party must focus on patient-centric, center-left policies that save Americans money while ensuring the coverage and prescriptions they need.\n\nFurther, given the divisiveness surrounding impeachment, House Democrats should work to create legislation that actually has a chance of passing in the Senate, unlike this notably progressive drug-pricing plan and many of the other bills that House Democrats have put forth this year.\n\n\u201cThese members need to show they\u2019ve made a difference up here. It\u2019s not just passing something out of the House,\u201d Rep. Kurt Schrader (D-Ore.) told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cYou want a win? You\u2019ve got to show you actually made a difference.\u201d\n\nWhile the nuances of drug policy are not salacious front-page stories, Americans will feel the direct impact of health care policy and drug pricing more than they will with the impeachment \u2014 but likely not the removal \u2014 of the president.\n\nAs the impeachment process unfolds, Democrats must refrain from making the same mistake that they made in 2016. Thus, the party needs to push a positive narrative that is centered on pro-growth reforms and substantive accomplishments, and is not merely a negative campaign against the president.\n\nUltimately, if the 2020 election devolves into another election on Donald Trump\u2019s personality, Democrats risk losing their 2018 congressional gains, and potentially even the White House once again.\n\nDouglas E.
