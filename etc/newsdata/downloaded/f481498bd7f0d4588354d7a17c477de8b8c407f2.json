Meanwhile I blinked 47 times typing that sentence.\n\nPaolo Ballesteros appeared on Eat Baluga for the showdown, and managed to keep his eyes open for a whopping 1 hour, 17 minutes and 3 seconds.\n\nThe show took to Twitter to congratulate Ballesteros:\n\n1 hour 17 minutes and 3 seconds na hindi kumukurap!\n\nCongratulations Paolo @pochoy29 ???? pic.twitter.com/satX30ARfQ \u2014 Eat Bulaga (@EatBulaga) October 5, 2019\n\nHe initially started by battling his co-host Pauleen Luna, who valiantly bowed out at a respective 30 minutes and 44 seconds. I\u2019m crying at the fact that Luna\u2019s efforts were outshone, considering that half an hour is fucking incredible in its own right.\n\nAnyway, take a look at Ballesteros\u2019 face in the final seconds and tell me you don\u2019t see sheer pain.\n\nThat\u2019s the face I make when I do some serious onion-cutting, or the face I make when I look at my DMs the morning after a night out.\n\nUnfortunately, there isn\u2019t an official record in the Guinness World Records in regards to the longest time spent without blinking, so Ballesteros\u2019 efforts will remain an unofficial world record. However, according to site RecordSetter, the previous unofficial record was held by American lad Julio Jaime who didn\u2019t blank for a mammoth 1 hour, 5 minutes and 11 seconds.\n\nCheck out Ballesteros and Luna\u2019s highlights on Eat Baluga below. You simply cannot help but gawk in amazement. Give this superhuman the offical record, goddamnit.", "description": "Filipino actor Paolo Ballesteros has achieved quite the exemplary feat by not blinking for over an hour.
