It\u2019s hard to understand what\u2019s true and what\u2019s not, and often, our brains prefer the version of events that feel intuitively more simple to understand.\n\nAnd of course, Social Security is anything but simple to understand.\n\nPeople tend to repeat some of these not-quite-true tidbits and downright falsehoods so often that they\u2019ve reached mythical status and are often accepted without question.\n\nIn fact, that\u2019s exactly how these myths seem so plausible and continue to live on. It\u2019s called the illusory truth effect: people are more likely to believe something is true after hearing it said over and over again.\n\nSeparating fact from fiction is critical. Believing these myths can prove dangerous to your financial well being \u2014 and even your ability to afford your retirement \u2014 because they can screw up the way you plan and prepare for the future.\n\nBut it\u2019s time that we cleared these muddy waters. Today, I want to break down seven Social Security myths that you might hear and believe but that just aren\u2019t true\u2026 no matter how many times you\u2019ve heard them repeated before.\n\nMyth No. 1: Illegal immigrants collect Social Security\n\nMy YouTube channel is absolutely inundated with these kinds of comments. The belief that illegal immigrants can come to the United States and immediately receive Social Security benefits is simply not true.\n\nWhat is true is that citizenship is not required. However, immigrants must be lawfully present and must pay into the system for at least 10 years.\n\nIn short, they have to follow the same eligibility rules as everyone else.\n\nThe Congressional Research Service makes the rules around Social Security benefits for non-citizens very clear when they say \u201cIf an individual never obtains work authorization, none of his or her Social Security covered earnings count toward qualifying for benefits.\u201d\n\nWe can\u2019t get much more clear than that, which makes this myth an easy one to bust. Illegal immigrants are not collecting nor can they collect Social Security benefits.\n\nMyth No. 2: The government raided the trust fund\n\nSome people believe the Social Security system wouldn\u2019t be facing insolvency today if the government kept their gosh-darned theivin\u2019 hands out of it.\n\nHere\u2019s the truth: There has never been any change in the way Social Security payroll taxes are used by the federal government.\n\nThe Social Security trust fund has never been \u201cput into the general fund of the government.\u201d It is a separate account, and always has been.\n\nWe can find the origins of this myth in the change that happened back in 1969. At that time, the government began listing the trust fund\u2019s transactions in a single budget along with all the other functions of the federal government.\n\nThe transactions were shown alongside other functions, but the trust fund remained a separate account. In 1990, the government began listing the activities of the trust fund separately.\n\nNone of these movements had anything to do with the actual operations of the trust fund; it was purely a change of accounting practices.\n\nThe government did not raid Social Security\u2019s trust fund. But you might still believe the myth that it did if you don\u2019t understand where the money went \u2014 because it is true that the system faces insolvency today.\n\nWhy isn\u2019t there a trust fund sitting around with trillions of dollars from all the money we working taxpayers put into the system? Because the Treasury uses those dollars.\n\nBefore you say, \u201caha! This proves the point; the government did steal the money!\u201d \u2026not so fast. The government always uses incoming revenue to meet its current obligations before it borrows money. This includes funds coming in and earmarked for the Social Security trust fund.\n\nFor every dollar that comes in from Social Security taxes, a special-issue Treasury bond takes its place. These bonds earn interest \u2014 which is a good thing.\n\nIn fact, since these bonds were first introduced to the trust fund, they generated $1.9 trillion in interest. For reference, the total trust fund balance is only $2.9 trillion.\n\nHad all those dollars been left in cash, the trust fund would be worth about two-thirds less and would have run dry much earlier than currently projected.\n\nThe bottom line is that there\u2019s no difference between the way the federal government runs the trust fund and the way your bank handles your cash accounts.\n\nWhen your paycheck is deposited, that bank uses that money and makes an accounting entry. When you need your money, the bank pulls it from the institution\u2019s account and notes a debit to your account. But no one gets hooked on conspiracy theories about banks misusing funds.\n\nNo one should get too worked up about the federal government using a nearly identical process, either.\n\nMyth No. 3: Social Security is going bankrupt\n\nMany politicians leverage this myth to manipulate people into voting a certain way. In every campaign, someone always talks about how bad Social Security is \u2014 and how they\u2019re the only candidate who can and will fix it and make everything okay again.\n\nTo compound that, the news channels figured out this is a headline that will get people to click, so they use it often. The result is you hear this myth perhaps more than any other\u2026 but it\u2019s not quite true.\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s really going on.\n\nSocial Security benefits are considered a \u201cpay as you go\u201d system. This means that the money that comes in from taxes today goes out to pay retirees today. For example, the taxes that I pay in right now also go out right now \u2014 and they pay for my dad\u2019s benefits.\n\nFor many years, more people paid in taxes than the system needed to pay out at the same time. More money came in than went out, and the excess started to accumulate in the trust fund that we hear so much about.\n\nBut now, the worker to retiree ratio has started to shift. By 2020, we\u2019ll reach a point where there is not enough money coming into the system to pay out to people claiming benefits. To make up this shortfall, the Social Security Administration will begin pulling money from the trust fund.\n\nThe issue here is that the current trust fund balance will only last until 2035. Once it\u2019s dry, benefits can only be paid from Social Security taxes. The projections show that will only generate 76% of what\u2019s needed to pay all benefits.\n\nWhile not great news, this is not bankruptcy.\n\nIf your boss told you today that you were only to get paid 76% of your normal salary, would you be bankrupt? No. You\u2019d be mad, to say the least, but you would not start receiving $0 and file for bankruptcy. Pay cuts happen, and when they do, we must adjust to our new level of earnings.\n\nSocial Security will have to do the same. The most likely adjustments will come in the form of a reduction in benefits or an increase in taxes. But Social Security will not just collapse and disappear.\n\nMyth No. 4: Members of Congress don\u2019t pay into the Social Security system\n\nMany people believe that members of Congress, being the ones who wrote (and get to revise) the rules, carved out a special retirement plan just for themselves. They get to live above Social Security, and don\u2019t have to rely on its benefits \u2014 and therefore, don\u2019t care what happens to it.\n\nThis is not true. Members of Congress may not end up relying exclusively on Social Security benefits in their old age\u2026 but many other Americans can say the same. Either way, both you and the men and women in Congress pay into the system.\n\nThis is another easy-to-bust myth: Since 1984, all members of Congress are required to contribute to Social Security just like anyone else.\n\nMyth No. 5: You\u2019ll never get back what you put in\n\nThis is one that I\u2019ve heard for years, but it wasn\u2019t until recently that I decided to dive in and figure this out once and for all.\n\nTo do this, I looked at the dollars I would put into Social Security over my working career, versus the dollars that I would take out.\n\nI also looked at only the part of Social Security taxes that I personally put into Social Security. Remember that the total FICA tax is 15.3%, but as an employee, you only pay half of that (or 7.65%). Your employer pays the rest.\n\nOf the money you owe, 1.45% goes Medicare and 6.2% goes to Social security. It\u2019s that 6.2% that I counted.\n\nI then looked at an individual who started working in 1972 and retired in 2019. That\u2019s a long time to work, but I wanted to illustrate what a maximum working lifetime may look like and thus give an opportunity for more taxes to be paid in.\n\nThen I looked at four different income levels during that time period. To get a baseline I used the National Average Wage Index published by the Social Security Administration.\n\nThe first income level was for an individual at 50% of the national average. Then I looked at 100%, and then 150%, and for a maximum amount of Social Security taxes paid in I also looked at an individual who would\u2019ve earned the maximum taxable wages for every year he or she was working.\n\nWith these earnings numbers, I used the calculator on the Social Security Administration website to calculate the benefits for each of these income levels at full retirement age. Finally, I increased that amount by 2% per year to keep up with the Social Security cost of living adjustment.\n\nWhen you look across all of this data, it\u2019s clear that each individual at their various income level got back the dollars they\u2019d personally paid in \u2014 and they got that money within just a few years of filing for benefits.\n\nIn fact, the amount of taxes paid in pales in comparison to the average amount of lifetime benefits paid out! That makes this myth wildly untrue.\n\nNot only do you get what you pay in to Social Security\u2026 you get that, and then some.\n\nMyth No. 6: Social Security benefits are an earned right\n\nThis would be really nice. If it were true. Unfortunately, Social Security payments are not guaranteed, and laws can be changed at any time that impact what you\u2019ll receive in benefits.\n\nSome of the other myths on this list seem\u2026 well, a little ridiculous. But I don\u2019t blame people for buying into this one. It seems logical, for one \u2014 but what\u2019s more deceiving is the fact that the government has essentially encouraged the belief that Social Security benefits are guaranteed.\n\nA 1936 pamphlet from the Social Security Administration specifically states the following:\n\n\u201cThe United States government will set up an account for you \u2026 The checks will come to you as a right.\u201d\n\nThat sounds pretty rock solid, clear, and obvious to me. But it didn\u2019t take long for the Supreme Court to step in and \u201cclarify\u201d this language for us.\n\nIn Helvering v. Davis, the Supreme Court\u2019s language set the tone for the future. Here\u2019s what they stated in the written opinion on the case:\n\n\u201cThe proceeds of both taxes are to be paid into the treasury like internal-revenue taxes generally, and are not earmarked in any way.\u201d\n\nThat eliminated the idea of the separate, personal account that the Social Security pamphlet originally implied. And then, in Flemming v. Nestor, the Supreme Court doubled down to make it very clear what the government thought about our \u201cright\u201d to Social Security benefits:\n\n\u201cThere has been a temptation throughout the program\u2019s history for some people to suppose that their FICA payroll taxes entitle them to a benefit in a legal, contractual sense. That is to say, if a person makes FICA contributions over a number of years, Congress cannot, according to this reasoning, change the rules in such a way that deprives a contributor of a promised future benefit. Under this reasoning, benefits under Social Security could probably only be increased, never decreased, if the Act could be amended at all. Congress clearly had no such limitation in mind when crafting the law.\u201d\n\nIf there was any doubt left about an individual\u2019s \u201cright\u201d to a Social Security benefit, this court case should\u2019ve banished it completely.\n\nBut just in case people forget that benefits can be changed or stopped altogether at any time, the Social Security Administration puts this reminder on every statement they create:\n\n\u201cYour estimated benefits are based on current law. Congress has made changes to the law in the past and can do so at any time.\u201d\n\nThe takeaway here is that the criteria for eligibility could change with the whims of politics. (Just take a look at the means-testing conversations that we\u2019re starting to hear about if you need further proof of this.)\n\nI\u2019m not trying to be the prophet of doom here, but I think we\u2019ll see changes to the system \u2014 and to benefits paid out \u2014 coming down the line soon. I also believe these changes will hit those who have significant assets and income.\n\nRemember, just because you get a statement showing a benefit amount doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019ll eventually get that benefit. The government can change the rules.\n\nMyth No. 7: Everyone should delay filing for Social Security benefits until age 70\n\nThis is a myth that finance folks like to spread based purely on the fact that for every month you delay filing, you get a higher benefit amount \u2014 and more must be better, right?\n\nNot necessarily, and certainly not in every single case. You can\u2019t apply this blanket rule to all situations, because there are multiple scenarios where filing early makes more sense than filing later.\n\nFrankly, if you need the income, you need to file as soon as you\u2019re eligible to receive it. Sometimes there is no strategy; if you are no longer working and you need the income, go file for benefits. Simple as that.\n\nYou might also want to file early if you\u2019re single and have health issues. You really only have your own income needs and life expectancy to consider in this situation, and it\u2019s one of the few cases where using a break-even analysis makes sense.\n\nA break-even analysis will tell you the age you need to live to in order to receive the same amount in benefits as you would if you waited and filed later.\n\nAnother situation in which filing early could be the best route is in the case of a few different spousal issues. The first is if your spouse is the higher earner and has health concerns which will shorten their life expectancy.\n\nSince their earnings were higher, their Social Security benefits will likely be higher. If they pass away early, your lower benefit will drop off and you\u2019ll begin to receive their higher benefit. Delaying filing for several years to increase your own benefit won\u2019t be worth it if you will eventually get your spouse\u2019s higher benefit.\n\nAnother issue to consider: if your spouse\u2019s earnings were lower and they\u2019re older than you. If your spouse\u2019s earnings were so low that the spousal benefit from your record will be the highest benefit they will receive, they cannot receive that benefit until you file for your own benefit.\n\nThis means that by filing early, you will receive a reduced benefit, but your spouse will become entitled to a benefit as well.\n\nThe reason we include this is that once your spouse reaches his or her full retirement age, their spousal benefit will not increase. So if they are older than you, they could be missing months or years worth of benefits while waiting on you to file.\n\nIf you receive a survivor\u2019s benefit, filing early could make sense for you, too. The survivors\u2019 benefit still allows you to switch back and forth between benefit options. You could file for your survivors\u2019 benefit at 62 (or even 60) and switch back to your own benefit at 70 at which point it would be at least 24% higher than your full retirement age benefit.\n\nFinally, if you have minor or disabled children at home, you might want to consider filing early because they may qualify for a benefit when you file. By delaying your filing, you miss out on your own reduced benefit plus the benefit payable to your child.\n\nJust keep in mind that if you file before your full retirement age, the earnings limit will apply. Once you pass your full retirement age, the earnings limit will no longer apply.\n\nDevin Carroll runs his own firm, Carroll Investment Management, and blogs on Social Security Intelligence, where this first appeared.
