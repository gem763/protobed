After the financial crisis of 2008, Barnard became interested in how gold is valued in society. More specifically, she was interested in \u201cour reverence for gold and its role in humanity\u2019s ruthless pursuit of progress.\u201d\n\nA statement about the book by its publisher further illuminates her quest:\n\n\u201cPrompted by the financial crisis of 2008 and its stark reminder of the global west\u2019s determination to accumulate wealth, Barnard sets out to question gold\u2019s continued status as economic barometer amidst new intangible forms of technological high \u2014 finance. By addressing this through photography, Barnard in turn raises the question of how her chosen medium can respond to such abstract events and concepts. The result is an ambitious project, one sketching a personal journey in which she ultimately tackles the complexity of material representation in these fragmented and troubling times.\u201d\n\nLooking through the book can be jarring. It feels disjointed and fragmentary. That is intentional. In a review in the British Journal of Photography, Diane Smyth notes that Barnard\u2019s book is an \u201cassemblage of interlocking layers, presented in chapters that refer to the history of gold in key periods and places through a wide variety of images and documents.\u201d Smyth also notes that wasn\u2019t a mistake, because Barnard, \u201cdidn\u2019t want to give the story a neat, phony narrative.\u201d Indeed, as Barnard told Smyth: \u201cThat was very important to me. We live in a very fragmented world, and that\u2019s how I photograph.\u201d\n\nThe book has seven sections, each giving detailed information about the history of gold. For example, the first section, \u201cSweat of the Sun,\u201d opens with the mythical tale of Jason and the Golden Fleece, which Barnard notes is one of the earliest accounts of the acquisition of gold. It then segues into a discussion of gold mining in present-day Peru, \u201cnow the sixth largest producer of gold in the world.\u201d\n\nThe book is interspersed with meditations on and reminders of the role gold has played and plays in our daily lives. For all of its complexity and sometimes disjointedness, the book is one of the most interesting I have seen this year.\n\nBarnard pursued the question about gold for over four years and across four continents. The book launches Thursday at Printed Matter in New York. You can buy the book and find out more at the publisher\u2019s website, here. There is also a multimedia website for the project here.\n\n\n\nImage from \"The Canary and The Hammer.\" (Lisa Barnard and MACK)\n\n\n\nImage from \"The Canary and The Hammer.\" (Lisa Barnard and MACK)\n\n\n\nImage from \"The Canary and The Hammer.\" (Lisa Barnard and MACK)\n\n\n\nImage from \"The Canary and The Hammer.\" (Lisa Barnard and MACK)\n\n\n\nImage from \"The Canary and The Hammer.\" (Lisa Barnard and MACK)\n\n\n\nImage from \"The Canary and The Hammer.\" (Lisa Barnard and MACK)\n\nIn Sight is The Washington Post\u2019s photography blog for visual narrative.
