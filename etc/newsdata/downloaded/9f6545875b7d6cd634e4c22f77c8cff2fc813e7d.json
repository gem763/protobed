Stephanopoulos was referring to acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney admitting to the quid pro quo earlier this week. Pompeo said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into hypotheticals and secondary things based on what someone else has said.\u201d\n\nMore from Rolling Stone\n\nStephanopoulos responded, \u201cExcept it\u2019s not a hypothetical.\u201d\n\nPompeo insisted, \u201cGeorge, you just said, \u2018If this happened.\u2019 That is, by definition, a hypothetical.\u201d\n\nStephanopoulos did not back down, saying, \u201cThe chief of staff said it did.\u201d\n\nJUST IN: \"I'm not going to get into hypotheticals,\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says when asked if it's appropriate to condition Ukraine aid on political investigation after Mick Mulvaney's comments.@GStephanopoulos: \"Except it's not a hypothetical\" https://t.co/vwL0GRcvq3 pic.twitter.com/VBBTvIVhAk \u2014 This Week (@ThisWeekABC) October 20, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is the moment when you could almost see Pompeo start to sweat and one could imagine the memes starting to multiply that would include the intro of Simon and Garfunkel\u2019s \u201cSound of Silence\u201d playing in the background as Pompeo went quiet for a prolonged period of time. Then the secretary eventually awoke from his coma and, with a gravelly voice, righted himself and continued to insist that the question was a hypothetical.\n\nAs national security editor for the New Republic Adam Weinstein pointed out, the scene was reminiscent of Trump\u2019s former campaign manager and now-jailed felon Paul Manafort\u2019s infamous 2016 viral moment when he was stumped and stuttered through his answer when asked about Trump\u2019s relationships with Russian oligarchs.\n\nWATCH: In light of AP story re Manafort \u2013 take a look at his response to a simple question re Russian oligarch ties https://t.co/getQDJUZZG pic.twitter.com/Ic85K4fAE0 \u2014 Yashar Ali \ud83d\udc18 (@yashar) March 22, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nBest of Rolling Stone\n\nSee where your favorite artists and songs rank on the Rolling Stone Charts.\n\n\n\nSign up for Rolling Stone\u2019s Newsletter.
