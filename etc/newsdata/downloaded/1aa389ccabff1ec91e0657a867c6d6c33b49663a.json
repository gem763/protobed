Ford\u2019s F-150 pickup and GM\u2019s Chevrolet Silverado are the top selling vehicles in the U.S. market.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be a real watershed for the whole industry,\u201d Ford Chairman Bill Ford told Reuters in a recent interview. The automaker has disclosed few details about the electric F-series, but Bill Ford hinted the truck could have load-carrying space under the hood in addition to the traditional bed in the back.\n\n\u201cYou pick up all that extra space where the engine compartment has been,\u201d Ford said. An electric F-Series could be a work truck - with its batteries functioning as a job site power source, he said. And it could be positioned as a high-performance vehicle next to the gas-fueled, 450 horsepower Raptor pickup truck.\n\nThe Dearborn, Michigan-based company has said it will invest $11.5 billion electrifying its vehicles by 2022, including adding 16 fully electric models, all of which will be profitable.\n\nFord and GM have more than one reason to take chances on electric pickups - a concept that some analysts and industry executives say could be a small niche.\n\nElectric pickups could help Ford and GM generate the significant sales of EVs they will need to meet tougher emission standards and electric vehicle mandates in California and other states. The Trump administration is moving to roll back those standards, but the electric trucks are a hedge if California prevails.\n\nGovernments and corporations - major buyers of pickups - could view electric pickups as a way to show a commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nCompetition from Tesla and EV startups Rivian Automotive and Workhorse Group Inc is another factor, although Ford recently mitigated some of that risk by investing $500 million in Rivian.\n\nThree years ago, Tesla CEO Elon Musk declared he wanted to attack the heart of the Detroit automakers\u2019 franchises with a Tesla electric pickup he has described as a \u201ccyberpunk\u201d truck with the performance of a Porsche 911 sports car. Tesla is expected to unveil a prototype this year, with analysts forecasting a 2022 debut. Musk declined to comment for this story.\n\nOfficials familiar with Ford and GM\u2019s plans said their electric pickups will be introduced by early 2022.\n\n\u201cOur strategy is very clear,\u201d Ted Cannis, Ford\u2019s director of electrification, told Reuters at the No. 2 U.S. automaker\u2019s product development center outside Detroit. \u201cWe\u2019re going to play to our strengths. We\u2019re good at pickups.\u201d\n\nFord\u2019s electric truck will be built on a company EV platform separate from the vehicles it will offer later on a Rivian platform.\n\nFord has said it will introduce a hybrid F-150 next year. Bill Ford said the all-electric F-150 \u201cwon\u2019t be too far after that.\u201d\n\nGM\u2019S ELECTRIC PICKUP PUSH\n\nAt GM, Chief Executive Mary Barra said in April the automaker would make an electric full-size pickup, but provided no further details. The company has said it plans to invest $8 billion to develop electric and self-driving vehicles, launching 20 new EVs globally by 2023.\n\nOfficials have not discussed plans for the electric pickup, but GM is pushing to introduce it within two years, according to several people familiar with the plans.\n\nThe lead engineer is Josh Tavel, who was the chief engineer for the Chevy Volt, Cadillac ELR, and Spark and Bolt EVs as well as executive chief engineer for full-size pickups, GM said.\n\nRivian CEO R.J. Scaringe believes positive reaction last fall for his company\u2019s R1T electric truck, due in fall 2020, shows the potential demand.\n\n\u201cThe question is how large is the demand and does it translate across all price points or does it stay more isolated in the higher price points?\u201d he told Reuters at the company\u2019s Plymouth, Michigan, headquarters.\n\nFord officials will not discuss sales expectations for the electric F-150. But Bill Ford said the electric pickup could outperform conservative expectations - if prospective customers try it.\n\nFord has broken with pickup segment conventions before - substituting a turbo-charged six-cylinder \u201cEcoBoost\u201d engine for the traditional V-8, and then giving the current generation of the truck an aluminum body instead of steel, the chairman said. The aluminum F-series is the best-selling pickup truck line in the United States, and about half are equipped with six-cylinder engines.\n\n\u201cLike it was with EcoBoost and like it was with aluminum, it\u2019s important we get people in the vehicle to try it,\u201d Ford said.\n\nBeau Boeckmann, president of Galpin Ford in the Los Angeles area and one of the largest U.S. Ford dealers, said customers are already asking about the truck.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be shocked,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the electric pickup truck has a huge future.\u201d\n\nNot everyone is so sanguine. Industry tracking firm IHS Markit has estimated the entire full-size electric truck segment will account for fewer than 30,000 sales in 2026, compared with an expected 2.3 million sales overall.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in uncharted waters,\u201d IHS Markit principal analyst Stephanie Brinley said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking niche in the beginning.\u201d\n\nDetroit\u2019s other big automaker, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV , has no current plans for an all-electric Ram, while Toyota Motor Corp is betting more heavily on a hybrid Tundra pickup.\n\n\u201cThe sliver of volume that\u2019s going to be electric pickups is not worthy of a business case,\u201d said one person familiar with Toyota\u2019s plans.\n\nThe Detroit automakers ultimately want to defend a segment they see as their own.\n\n\u201cWhy would we let Tesla beat us with a pickup truck?\u201d said one person familiar with Ford\u2019s plans. \u201cThat\u2019s our turf.\u201d", "description": "Large pickup trucks that tow most of the profits in to Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co are holdovers from another century - with heavy ladder frames and big internal combustion engines in the front driving the wheels in the back.", "authors": ["Ben Klayman", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429397051&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C0RY-OCABS", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
