It doesn\u2019t bend. It makes no sound. For these reasons (and more), it is probably the only part of the body inherently antithetical to TLC. You really can\u2019t make it look better unless you are bald and take it to the car wash, right?\n\nWrong.\n\nThere are treatments for the scalp beyond regular shampoo \u2014 ways to invigorate it, exfoliate it, scrub it, spray it, nourish it. And you don\u2019t even need to have dandruff or other crusty deposits that make the human body essentially disgusting. What I know about scalp care came from my divine hairstylist, Leanna, who told me that treating your scalp is just as essential as treating any other part of the body. Among the things she taught me is that blood flow is critical to growing new hair from your follicles, and that dead skin and oil accumulation are two things that regularly threaten to block that blood flow.\n\nI now use a variety of products to care for my scalp \u2014 which is not very expressive, so I can\u2019t say I actually feel any rejuvenation. The process hasn\u2019t yielded the type of transformation that calls for a ticker-tape parade, but in keeping my scalp both clean and well fed, I am seeing some improvement in my dreaded scalp acne. As with all skin care, the key is regular use: The more dedicated you are, the better the results.\n\nShampoos\n\nGiven how much I already loved Oribe\u2019s Shampoo for Magnificent Volume, I built my scalp-care regimen around four of the brand\u2019s products: two shampoos, a scrub, and a spray. For shampoos, I alternate between Magnificent Volume and Oribe\u2019s Serene Scalp Anti-Dandruff Shampoo. Both are formulated with Oribe\u2019s \u201csignature complex\u201d of ingredients including watermelon, lychee, and edelweiss flower extracts, but the Serene Scalp Shampoo also has sugarcane to hydrate and nourish both scalp and hair, a pinch of caffeine to help energize and rejuvenate, and the great catch-all of salicylic acid (which will soon replace table salt) to exfoliate. Importantly, dandruff is not a requirement.\n\nGoop G.Tox Himalayan Salt Scrub Shampoo In addition to the above, I use Goop\u2019s G.Tox Himalayan Salt Scrub Shampoo once a week. I think of it as an exfoliant booster. It\u2019s fun as hell to work it in, taking a healthy gob (I refuse to say goop) of the stuff and feeling all those salt crystals scrubbing the scalp and hair as they do their exfoliation thing. I like its rough texture, and feel deliciously clean afterwards \u2014 the ultimate in squeaky. $42 at Goop Buy\n\nScrub\n\nOribe Serene Scalp Exfoliating Scrub This may be piling on, but I also use Oribe\u2019s Serene Scalp Exfoliating Scrub on a weekly basis, applying it during a shower so the hair is wet. (I rub it in before shampooing.) The texture is soft compared to the Goop scrub-shampoo; it feels almost like an oil and is easy on the scalp. The ingredients \u2014 polymer beads, hydroxy and glycolic acids, flower extracts, peppermint oil, and malachite extract (derived from what\u2019s said to be the sacred stone of Egypt) \u2014 all work to both nourish and hydrate, while protecting hair from color depletion and damage from the elements. A note: Don\u2019t use this and the Goop stuff on the same day; make sure there is an interval of at least three days in between. The Oribe scrub does a better job of nourishing the scalp, while the Goop scrub-shampoo is better at removing dirt and dead skin. $52 at Amazon Buy $52 at Amazon Buy\n\nSpray\n\nOribe Serene Scalp Thickening Treatment Spray I use this every day. Mist it into still-wet hair, then style. The spray not only feeds the scalp with ingredients like soothing peppermint oil and energizing witch hazel water, but also has stuff like pea sprout extract and Biotin to help thicken thinning hair. (An in-house study by Oribe claims that 86 percent of those surveyed had thicker hair after two months.) I\u2019ve found that my hair also just looks better after using this to style it, because the spray gives it a firmer hold. $76 at Amazon Buy $76 at Dermstore Buy\n\nSerum\n\nSusanne Kaufmann Hair Elixir The final product in my scalp-care arsenal is Susanne Kaufmann Hair Elixir. Among the ingredients are wheat germ and a vitamin complex composed of vitamins A, C, and E. You apply the serum as needed and leave it on overnight. I like it so much I am using it daily as the last product in my nightly regimen. It is a nice coda to the evening, leaving the scalp revived instead of a creeping cesspool of oil by the time it hits the pillow. The Hair Elixir\u2019s product description also promises that it will calm your scalp; I think it actually does, because while the rest of my body pulsates in terror at the thought of so much skin care and so little time, my scalp remains at peace. $105 at Totokaelo Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
