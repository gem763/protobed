Perhaps feeling some extra motivation, they trounced the Aussies 43-6.\n\nWallaby captain John Eales later described the action as his biggest regret.\n\nThe wedge\n\n\n\nThe first known counter-challenge to the haka was by Ireland in 1989 when they formed a V-shaped wedge and moved slowly towards the All Blacks until their captain Willie Anderson was nose-to-nose with his opposite number.\n\nWords were exchanged after the haka was finished, whereupon Anderson leapt into the air and whipped up a packed Lansdowne Road crowd to a frenzy. To little avail: New Zealand won 23-6.\n\nWorld Cup wedge\n\n\n\nFrance added extra spice to the 2011 World Cup final in Auckland when they advanced - slightly haphazardly - towards the All Blacks during the haka.\n\nThe move cost France a fine of \u00a32 500 and prompted officials to lay down regulations separating the two teams during the haka. In the end, France also lost the game 8-7.\n\nCockerill's clash\n\n\n\nThe closest a haka challenge has come to blows was in 1997 when combustible English hooker Richard Cockerill advanced right into the face of opposite number Norm Hewitt, chuntering away throughout the dance.\n\nThe pair clashed heads and had to be separated by England captain Martin Johnson, who pushed Hewitt away as the English went back to receive the kick-off.\n\nStart yours early\n\n\n\nIn the 2003 World Cup, Tonga upstaged the haka by performing their \"Sipi Tau\" war dance simultaneously, to the delight of the crowd in Brisbane.\n\nThe Tongans were supposed to wait until the haka was complete before starting their response but no sooner had the All Blacks uttered their \"ka mate\", they spontaneously launched into their own dance.", "description": "England have been fined for crossing the halfway line in their response to New Zealand's haka before last week's Rugby World Cup semi-final.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9405/07844bd4bdf544dea1ba76fb215bbbb7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
