The tactic has been used elsewhere in the world to make it easier for police to identify protesters later on.\n\nLater in the day in a commercial street near police headquarters in the central Wan Chai district, hundreds of protesters started a huge blaze after they formed a wall out of barricades and set it on fire.\n\nAround 7.30pm local time, many were pointing laser beams that streaked the night sky above them, while some threw petrol bombs into the fire sending black smoke billowing into the air.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

prepared to clear the street. They made a few arrests and fired tear gas and the water cannon at protesters, who responded with more petrol bombs. But most protesters had already retreated.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Police soon caught up and charged protesters, advancing quickly around 10pm. Local media also report that undercover officers infiltrated protesters.\n\nIn another standoff police stormed a subway carriage and beat passengers with batons in the late hours of the evening.\n\nWhile it is unclear what may have sparked the altercation, footage captured by local broadcaster TVB showed passengers cowering and throwing their hands up as riot police burst through the doors.\n\nActivists responded by taking up a corner of the train and raising umbrellas as a makeshift barricade. Officers then left the carriage as the doors closed.\n\nAhead of Saturday, police rejected an application from the Civil Human Rights Front, a group that has organised pro-democracy demonstrations counting more than 1 million protesters.\n\nBut religious meetings do not require police approval, so around 1,000 joined a \u201cChristian march\u201d earlier in the day, marching to a Methodist church and police headquarters. They sang hymns and chanted slogans of the pro-democracy movement.\n\nSpeaking at the rally, Democratic Party lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting said Hong Kong citizens would keep fighting for their rights and freedoms despite the arrests of several prominent activists and lawmakers in the past two days, including activist Joshua Wong.\n\n\u201cI do believe the government deliberately arrested several leaders of the democratic camp to try to threaten Hong Kong people not to come out to fight against the evil law,\u201d Mr Lam said.\n\nSome of Hong Kong\u2019s most prominent pro-democracy activists had been arrested in a 24-hour crackdown that critics say was designed to intimidate the movement ahead of Saturday\u2019s demonstration. Officials said the arrests were related to a 21 June protest in which demonstrators blockaded a police headquarters for 15 hours.\n\nSome three months ago, protesters began rallying against a now-shelved extradition bill that would have allowed residents to stand trial in mainland China. But over time, the movement has morphed into a broader demands for democratic reform, an independent investigation into police violence, and the resignation of Hong Kong chief-executive Carrie Lam.\n\nThere have been frequent clashes between protesters and police, who have often fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds, amid accusations of excessive force.\n\nSaturday's protest also marked the fifth anniversary of China\u2019s decision against fully democratic elections in the semi-autonomous territory when on 31 August 2014, the standing committee of China\u2019s legislature ruled that Hong Kong would democratically elect its leader, but choosing from a list of candidates approved by a nominating committee.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party has been quick to accuse the US, UK and other foreign powers of being behind the protests and interfering in its internal affairs.\n\nSome believe China would want to quell the unrest ahead of the celebrations for the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China on 1 October.\n\nTwo days ago, China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) moved military vehicles and troops across the border into Hong Kong, but said the movements were part of an \u201cannual normal routine\u201d.\n\nSally Yeung, a 27-year-old Christian at the religious rally, told Reuters: \u201cHong Kong has religious freedom.\n\n\u201cWe are praying at different check points and praying for justice to arrive in Hong Kong. If they prosecute us simply because we are praying, they infringe our religious freedom.\u201d\n\nHovering under an umbrella outside the government offices, Eric, a 22-year-old student, said telling people not to protest was like telling them not to breathe. \u201cI feel its my duty to fight for democracy. Maybe we win, maybe we lose. But we fight.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by AP and Reuters", "description": "Hong Kong\u00a0descended into violence on Saturday as protesters and the police clashed multiple times across the city, using petrol bombs,\u00a0tear gas\u00a0and\u00a0water cannon.
