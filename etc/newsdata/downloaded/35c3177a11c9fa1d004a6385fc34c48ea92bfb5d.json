[I felt like] \u2018I\u2019m going to stay here, because if I come back up, I\u2019m literally going to be breathing like a dog!\u2019 \u201d\n\nAD\n\nThere was so much to be proud of:\n\nBreaking Belarusan Vitaly Scherbo\u2019s mark of 23 world medals, which had stood since 1996.\n\nConquering gymnastics\u2019 least predictable event, the balance beam, with near flawless execution of the world\u2019s most technically demanding routine to win gold with a whopping 15.066 points. China\u2019s Liu Tingting (14.433) and Li Shijia (14.300) took silver and bronze, respectively.\n\nAD\n\nRepeating as world champion on floor with, again, the world\u2019s most difficult routine. Despite stepping out of bounds on an over-exuberant tumbling sequence, Biles scored 15.133 points \u2014 well ahead of her nearest competitors, who included fellow American Sunisa Lee, 16, who took silver (14.133) in her world-championships debut. Russia\u2019s Angelina Melnikova (14.066) took bronze.\n\nAD\n\nBut what meant most to Biles, apart from the medals, was the way in which she extended the boundaries of women\u2019s gymnastics by introducing two new skills at this competition \u2014 skills that now bear her name.\n\nThe competitive shelf-life of elite female gymnasts is sadly short. Only the rare champions manage to extend their careers to two Olympic cycles, as Biles will do next summer at 2020 Tokyo Games. Those who do tend to shift their emphasis from athleticism to artistry as they mature and their bodies age.\n\nAD\n\nWhat makes Biles peerless is that she continues to evolve in both the difficulty and artistry of her skills. At 22, she is doing more difficult gymnastics than she did in sweeping to five Olympic medals, four of them gold, at the 2016 Rio Games when she was 19.\n\nAD\n\nAfter taking a 12-month hiatus from competition following her Olympic triumph, Biles has added two original skills to her routines \u2014 a double twisting, double somersault dismount on beam and a triple twisting, double somersault in her floor routine.\n\nBecause Biles was the first to successfully land them in a world competition, both skills are now named for her in gymnastics\u2019 official Code of Points. Long after she retires, they will be known as the Biles dismount on beam and the Biles II on floor (to distinguish it from another skill she pioneered on floor that\u2019s already called the Biles).\n\nAD\n\nAccording to Biles\u2019s coach, Laurent Landi, it\u2019s this impulse to create and extend the boundaries of what\u2019s possible that stokes her competitive fire more than any mountain of medals and trophies.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhen you had so much success in the sport, what brings you back in the gym is something original \u2014 some different stuff,\u201d Laurent explained. \u201cIt\u2019s not just winning \u2026 It\u2019s much better to come with a purpose [such as] putting your name in the Code of Points or trying a different skill that nobody else ever did before.\u201d\n\nWith her parents, Nellie and Ron, looking on from the stands, the 4-foot-8 Biles exuded effortlessness and euphoria in spinning, leaping and tumbling up and down the four-inch wide balance beam. The only pity was that Biles\u2019s fluency on the beam masks the staggering rigor of her skills and the intense training that makes them possible.\n\nAD\n\nWith the history-making 24th medal at stake, Biles opted not to perform the daring double-double dismount. The risk outweighed the reward.\n\nAD\n\nShe held nothing back on her floor exercise. Why would she, as the reigning Olympic and four-time (soon to be five-time) world champion on the floor?\n\nWhile Biles made history Sunday, she had set a record of some sort each day she competed at these world championships.\n\nLast Tuesday, she led the U.S. women to their fifth consecutive world team medal and, in the process, eclipsed Svetlana Khorkina as the most decorated female gymnasts in history by collecting her 21st world medal.\n\nOn Thursday, she won her fifth individual all-around world gold by a record margin, pantomiming a mic-drop upon completion.\n\nShe tied Scherbo\u2019s record 23 world medals on Saturday. And Sunday, she surged past.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOutside of competition, Biles\u2019s personal growth and tenacity have been equally impressive.\n\nBiles has competed at the senior ranks of elite gymnastics for seven years without evidence of burnout. Not pushed by overzealous parents or harsh coaches, she is driven by her own zeal to extend her limits. In this respect, Biles is competing against herself rather than the rest of the world. As Nellie Biles told her daughter via Twitter at the outset of this competition: \u201cBe the Best Simone.\u201d\n\nMoreover, in the wake of the sexual-abuse scandal in U.S. women\u2019s gymnastics, Biles has developed a voice that commands attention. She publicly acknowledged in January 2018 that she, too, was a survivor of the abuse perpetrated by former national team doctor Larry Nassar. And via social media and in interviews, Biles has castigated USA Gymnastics for failing to protect young gymnasts and demanded overdue structural and leadership change \u2014 all while making her peace, at least outwardly, with her role as the embattled organization\u2019s most marketable star.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRead more:", "description": "After the equivalent of a lunch break, the Olympian returned to the arena and won another gold \u2014 this one, on floor exercise.", "authors": ["Liz Clarke", "Sports Reporter Focusing On Tennis"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/tjDb81EU95buc6kfEeuzh7-jW_c=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HZMCC7HNYAI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
