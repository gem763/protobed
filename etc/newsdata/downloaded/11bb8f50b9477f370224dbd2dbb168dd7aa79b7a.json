A source familiar with the situation described the odds of a deal at ASEAN as 50:50.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnce the deal is concluded, work will then have to commence on all the fine print and then each member country will have to ratify the deal before it comes into force.\n\nIt is understood there have been discussions at the margins about doing a deal without India, much like the Trans-Pacific Partnership-11 which was negotiated after the United States withdrew from the TPP under Donald Trump.\n\nBut the clear preference is to have India involved and there is a reluctance to canvass alternatives.\n\nAs well as the strategic importance of co-opting India and China in a regional trade deal, Australia is eager to conclude the RCEP as an insurance against the fallout from the US-China trade war and to send a global message against protectionism.\n\nAs the trade war dominated the G20 in Japan in June, Mr Morrison stressed the importance of the RCEP and an FTA with the European Union.\n\nHe said Australia and the other G20 nations, while doing what they could to end the dispute between the superpowers, were not prepared to \"just sit there and wait for some sort of resolution''.\n\n\"Two of the biggest [trade deals] running right now for us and for this year are the RCEP, which is principally driven out of ASEAN, as well as our efforts to land an agreement with the EU,\" he said.", "description": "Plans by Australia and 15 other nations to conclude a new regional free trade agreement in a little less than three weeks remain uncertain.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2926%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_368%2C$y_75/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/08b541c0ddd9edd9a1f246d00af707b831ac11c1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
