Over the last few months, though, I\u2019ve been trying to diversify what I watch there. I want to see smaller creators, more art and music, and some talk shows and podcasts. I know all of that is out there, plus I\u2019m convinced that there are some gems I\u2019m missing. But I find myself running into the same wall: it\u2019s hard to find streamers I like. I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019m bad at Twitch.\n\nI suspect I\u2019m not the only one with this problem.\n\nThe breadth of humanity streaming on Twitch is staggering, and it\u2019s possible to find someone doing something you want to see \u2014 or, more realistically, something you didn\u2019t know you needed in your life until the moment you stumbled on it. I get most of my recommendations from my constellation of too-online friends, and a lot of them are great; they know what I might like, and they\u2019re usually right.\n\nThat said, when I\u2019m home alone at some odd hour of the night or morning and I\u2019m in the mood for something new, I sometimes feel out of luck. Twitch\u2019s recommendation algorithm is robust, but it\u2019s best at serving you stuff similar to what you\u2019ve been watching or what you\u2019ve already seen. Sometimes, I feel like I\u2019m stuck in an unbreakable programming loop, falling through the same inputs and outputs and returning the same result.\n\nWhen I do decide to search by category \u2014 which is to say by game \u2014 I usually sort the list by the number of viewers from high to low and then scroll as far as I can down the page to see exactly who\u2019s streaming something like Trials Rising or EverQuest at 1:30 on a weekday afternoon. (It is never who you\u2019d think.)\n\nGames are helpfully broken out into their own sections. Everything else is the \u201cJust Chatting\u201d section, the catch-all bucket for streamers who aren\u2019t playing a video game. That includes everyone from IRL streamers \u2014 who go live while they\u2019re out and about in the world \u2014 to people streaming dubbed anime. It\u2019s the most diverse side of Twitch, and it is overwhelming.\n\nThere\u2019s also an element of chaos in Twitch\u2019s categories. The tags for games and everything are chosen by users, which means that the categories bleed into each other all the time; Twitch\u2019s algorithm, too, is good at putting smaller streamers onto its front page if you\u2019re logged in. And it\u2019s absolutely possible, with enough scrolling, to come across something great.\n\nYouTube\u2019s algorithm, by contrast, is very good at showing you what other people liked. For that reason, most of the videos it serves you next are related to one another by both subject matter and human taste. It\u2019s harder to do that with live videos \u2014 they\u2019re obviously more unpredictable \u2014 but going from one platform to the other throws the difference into sharp relief. YouTube\u2019s algorithm has its problems (radicalization, for instance), but aimlessly browsing the website is a wholly different experience. It is focused; Twitch feels more like surfing live TV without a channel guide.\n\nTwitch holds an ocean of content. Its stars are some of the biggest on the internet. In practice, however, it feels like a small town. The new streamers I watch are usually related in some way to the ones I already follow, and outside of friend recommendations, my main mode of discovery is through raids \u2014 when a streamer who\u2019s live sends their entire live audience to another live channel \u2014 and hosts, which is when streamers show anyone who comes to their page a handpicked channel that\u2019s currently live. Those are two tools that a lot of other user-generated content platforms don\u2019t have, and they are a valuable way to find new streamers to follow.\n\nBut the chaos makes Twitch as a platform biased toward larger channels: they\u2019re already known, which helps them grow faster. That, combined with the fact that a Twitch partnership is a way of signaling that a channel is safe for advertisers, means that Twitch focuses on bigger channels to the detriment, in terms of audience and revenue, of smaller ones. And that\u2019s a shame because joining a small community is one of the most pleasant experiences one can have online.\n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s an easy solution. Then again, maybe it is just a me problem. But if you can solve it, I\u2019d love some help. Who do you love to watch? I\u2019m all ears.", "description": "Twitch\u2019s recommendation algorithm is robust, but it\u2019s best at serving you stuff that\u2019s similar to what you\u2019ve been watching (and a lot of channels you\u2019ve already seen).
