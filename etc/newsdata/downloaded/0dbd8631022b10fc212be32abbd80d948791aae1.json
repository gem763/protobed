More and more private companies and city authorities are investing in green roofs, drawn to their wide-ranging benefits which include savings on energy costs, mitigating the risk from floods, creating habitats for urban wildlife, tackling air pollution and urban heat and even producing food.\n\nA recent report suggested that the UK\u2019s green roof market is expanding at a rate of 17 per cent each year. The world\u2019s largest rooftop farm will open in Paris in 2020, superseding similar schemes in New York City and Chicago. Stuttgart, in Germany, is thought of as \u201cthe green roof capital of Europe\u201d, while Singapore is even installing green roofs on buses.\n\nThese increasingly radical urban designs can help cities adapt to the monumental challenges they face, such as access to resources and a lack of green space due to development. But buy-in from city authorities, businesses and other institutions is crucial to ensuring their success \u2013 as is research investigating different options to suit the variety of rooftop spaces found in cities.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

London is home to much of the UK\u2019s green roof market, mainly due to forward-thinking policies such as the 2008 London Plan, which paved the way to more than double the area of green roofs in the capital.\n\nAlthough London has led the way, there are now \u201cliving labs\u201d at the Universities of Sheffield and Salford which are helping to establish the precedent elsewhere. The Ignition project \u2013 led by the Greater Manchester Combined Authority \u2013 involves the development of a living lab at the University of Salford, with the aim of uncovering ways to convince developers and investors to adopt green roofs.\n\nOngoing research is showcasing how green roofs can integrate with living walls and sustainable drainage systems on the ground, such as street trees, to better manage water and make the built environment more sustainable.\n\nResearch is also demonstrating the social value of green roofs. Doctors are increasingly prescribing time spent gardening outdoors for patients dealing with anxiety and depression. And research has found that access to even the most basic green spaces can provide a better quality of life for dementia sufferers and help prevent obesity.\n\nIn North America, green roofs have become mainstream, with a wide array of expansive, accessible and food-producing roofs installed in buildings. Again, city leaders and authorities have helped push the movement forward \u2013 only recently, San Francisco created a policy requiring new buildings to have green roofs. Toronto has policies dating from the 1990s, encouraging the development of urban farms on rooftops.\n\nThese countries also benefit from having newer buildings, which make it easier to instal green roofs. Being able to store and distribute water right across the rooftop is crucial to maintaining the plants on any green roof \u2013 especially on \u201cedible roofs\u201d which farm fruit and vegetables. And it\u2019s much easier to create this capacity in newer buildings, which can typically hold greater weight, than retro-fit old ones. Having a stronger roof also makes it easier to grow a greater variety of plants, since the soil can be deeper.\n\nThe new normal?\n\nFor green roofs to become the norm for new developments, there needs to be buy-in from public authorities and private actors. Those responsible for maintaining buildings may have to acquire new skills, such as landscaping, and in some cases volunteers may be needed to help out. Other considerations include installing drainage paths, meeting health and safety requirements and perhaps allowing access for the public, as well as planning restrictions and disruption from regular activities in and around the buildings during installation.\n\nTo convince investors and developers that installing green roofs is worthwhile, economic arguments are still the most important. The term \u201cnatural capital\u201d has been developed to explain the economic value of nature; for example, measuring the money saved by installing natural solutions to protect against flood damage, adapt to climate change or help people lead healthier and happier lives.\n\nAs the expertise about green roofs grows, official standards have been developed to ensure that they are designed, built and maintained properly, and function well. Improvements in the science and technology underpinning green roof development have also led to new variations on the concept.\n\nFor example, \u201cblue roofs\u201d increase the capacity of buildings to hold water over longer periods of time, rather than drain away quickly \u2013 crucial in times of heavier rainfall. There are also combinations of green roofs with solar panels, and \u201cbrown roofs\u201d which are wilder in nature and maximise biodiversity.\n\nIf the trend continues, it could create new jobs and a more vibrant and sustainable local food economy \u2013 alongside many other benefits. There are still barriers to overcome, but the evidence so far indicates that green roofs have the potential to transform cities and help them function sustainably long into the future. The success stories need to be studied and replicated elsewhere, to make green, blue, brown and food-producing roofs the norm in cities around the world.\n\nMichael Hardman is a senior lecturer in urban geography at the University of Salford.
