Lee is also known as a singer, having released multiple techno hits in the 1990s and early 2000s. [LITTLE BIG PICTURES, KTH]\n\nActor and singer Lee Jung-hyun has returned to the big screen with \u201cLove, Again,\u201d her first rom-com since her acting debut in 1996.The film, released on Oct. 17, tells the hilarious story of the eccentric Sun-young (Lee), who demands an elaborate divorce ceremony with Hyun-woo (Kwon Sang-woo) when he asks for a divorce. Things get a bit complicated when Sun-young finds out that her new love interest Sang-chul (Lee Jong-hyuk) is the childhood friend of her ex-husband, however.\u201cThe scenario doesn\u2019t make sense in real life, who would want to go through a \u2018divorce ceremony?\u2019\u201d Lee Jung-hyun said during an interview. \u201cBut I understood the situation a bit better when I began understanding Sun-young. I think she actually didn\u2019t want a divorce, and just told Hyun-woo that she\u2019ll agree to it only after a ceremony, not expecting him to actually go through with it.\u201dAlthough Lee exuded quirkiness and a cheerful energy in her music career, she\u2019s never starred in a romantic comedy before. In fact, many of the projects she worked on were dark and heavy, including the revenge thriller \u201cAlice in Earnestland\u201d (2014) and her debut film \u201cA Petal\u201d (1996), which addressed the horrific 1980 Gwangju massacre.\u201cLike anyone else, I had a desire to try out various characters. But because I took on heavy roles, producers continued offering me similar characters. \u2018Love, Again\u2019 was a really refreshing opportunity for me. I said I would take it as soon as I read the screenplay.\u201dPerhaps nervous for her first rom-com, filming got off to a rocky start. But Lee said her colleagues helped ease her through with laughs and jokes.\u201cIn the first scene, I was supposed to have a meal at a beef bone soup restaurant. But I was so tense that my hand that was holding the spoon was shaking. Kwon got really surprised, because the image he had about me from my music was like a techno female warrior. Actually, thanks to funny episodes like that, I could film comfortably.\u201d\u201cLove, Again\u201d was a special film for Lee in a very personal way as well - as fate would have it, the actor was able to find the man of her dreams while preparing for the film and tied the knot this past April.\u201cI actually really wanted to get married. But I had given up [searching] as I was getting old and had limited opportunities to meet people. It wasn\u2019t as if I could upload my profile onto an online dating service.\u201dLee met her husband of five months on a blind date through a mutual friend.\u201cI got really lucky,\u201d Lee recalled. \u201cI felt like if it was him, I could comfortably continue my acting career. He\u2019s younger than me, and he was really anxious on the first date - it was cute. As it turned out, he and his father were big fans. They had all my CDs at home.\u201dAs a well-known celebrity, keeping the relationship private before marriage was a difficult challenge. Lee had plenty of unexpected encounters with people who recognized her on her dates, but to her relief, no one pried into the matter and just gave her \u201ca knowing look and gave [her] space.\u201dChildren are definitely in her plans too, partially due to the influence of her \u201cLove, Again\u201d co-stars.\u201cKang and Lee would upload pictures of taking their kids to the park, and that made me think that it would be nice to have a family of my own. I liked children before, but seeing Kang and Lee so happy made me want to have kids soon.\u201dWhen Lee\u2019s not filming, she spends a lot of time at home engaged in some of her favorite hobbies - cooking and watching food channels. Cooking helps her relieve some stress and concentrate, she says. \u201cIf I focus on one thing, bad thoughts tend to go away. That\u2019s why we need hobbies. Also there\u2019s nothing that makes me happier than inviting my close colleagues over, cooking up something tasty and chatting.\u201dHaving just wrapped up filming \u201cThe Peninsula,\u201d director Yeon Sang-ho\u2019s upcoming sequel to zombie blockbuster \u201cTrain to Busan\u201d (2016), Lee\u2019s now taking some time off and making plans for her next steps.Releasing a new album is an option, Lee revealed.Fans have been waiting a long time for Lee\u2019s return. Her last single \u201cV\u201d was released in 2013, and it\u2019s been nine years since her last full-length album. Lee is best remembered as a singer for her groundbreaking electronica hits like \u201cWa\u201d from 1999, when she dressed up in ancient imperial and extra-terrestrial costumes and put on glamorous shows while popularizing many iconic dance moves.Lee\u2019s hits and music videos have actually been enjoying a resurgence recently, thanks to the popularity of the so-called Online Tapgol Park, a YouTube channel where broadcaster SBS streams music performances from the late 1990s and early 2000s. Being one of the hottest singers of the time, Lee is a recurring face in the channel.\u201cMy husband and colleagues seem to like it, but I actually find them a bit embarrassing. I\u2019m the only one with wings and murmuring alien languages. I think to myself \u2018Why did I do that? I had a lot of energy.\u2019\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t retired from the music scene yet. I\u2019m always thinking about [coming back]. I plan on sharing good songs with fans if I have the chance.\u201dBY CHO YEON-GYEONG [kim.eunjin1@joongang.co.kr]\u201d\ubc14\ub4e4\ubc14\ub4e4 \ub5a8\uc5c8\ub2e4\u201d\u2026'\ub450\ubc88\ud560\uae4c\uc694' \uc774\uc815\ud604, \uccab\ub85c\ucf54 \ub3c4\uc804\uae30\ud0c0\uace0\ub098\uae38 '\ub7ec\ube14\ub9ac'\ud558\ub2e4. \uc790\uadf8\ub9c8\ud55c \uccb4\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubfdc\uc5b4\uc838 \ub098\uc624\ub294 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\uac00 \uc5b4\ub9c8\uc5b4\ub9c8\ud574 \uadf8 \uac04\uadf9\uc758 \uc2e0\uc120\ud568\uc774 '\uac15\ub82c\ud55c \uc5ec\uc804\uc0ac' \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \uc644\uc131\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc6d0\uccb4 \uc0ac\ub791\uc2a4\ub7fd\uae30\ub85c \uc720\uba85\ud55c \uc774\uc815\ud604(40)\uc774\ub2e4. \uc313\uace0 \uc313\uc740 \ubcf8\uc5f0\uc758 \ub9e4\ub825\uc744 \ub4dc\ub514\uc5b4 \uccab \ub85c\ub9e8\ud2f1 \ucf54\ubbf8\ub514 \uc601\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c4\ud68c\uc5c6\uc774 \uc3df\uc544\ub0c8\ub2e4.\uc601\ud654 '\ub450\ubc88\ud560\uae4c\uc694(\ubc15\uc6a9\uc9d1 \uac10\ub3c5)'\ub97c \ucc0d\uc73c\uba74\uc11c \uacb0\ud63c\uc744 \ud76c\ub9dd\ud588\uace0, \uc2e4\uc81c \uacb0\ud63c\uc5d0 \uace8\uc778\ud558\ub294 \uc131\uacfc(?)\uae4c\uc9c0 \uac70\ub480\ub2e4. \uadf8\ud1a0\ub85d \uc6d0\ud588\ub358 \uccab \ub85c\ucf54\uc5d0 \ud604\uc2e4 \uacb0\ud63c\uae4c\uc9c0, \uc774\uc815\ud604\uc5d0\uac8c\ub294 \uc5b4\ub290 \ub54c\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc758\ubbf8\uc788\ub294 \ud55c \ud398\uc774\uc9c0\ub97c \uc7a5\uc2dd\ud55c \uc21c\uac04\uc774\ub2e4. \"\ud589\uc6b4\uc774\ub2e4\"\uba70 \ubca0\uc2dc\uc2dc \ubbf8\uc18c\uc9d3\ub294 \uc774\uc815\ud604\uc740 \ud589\ubcf5\ud55c \ub9c8\uc74c\uc744 \uad73\uc774 \uac10\ucd94\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\ub2e4.\ud2b9\uc720\uc758 \ud558\uc774\ud150\uc158\uc740 \uc774\uc815\ud604\uc758 \uc815\uccb4\uc131\uc744 \ub2e8\ubc88\uc5d0 \uc785\uc99d\uc2dc\ucf30\uace0, \uc2e0\ud63c\uc758 \ub2ec\ub2ec\ud568\uc740 \uc774\uc815\ud604\uc758 \ud55c \ub9c8\ub514 \ud55c \ub9c8\ub514\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uc885\uc77c\uad00 \ubb3c\uc52c \ud48d\uacbc\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc774\uc57c\uae30\ub294 \uae30\uc2b9\uc804\uacb0\ud63c, \ub0a8\ud3b8\uc73c\ub85c \ub05d\ub098 \ub418\ub824 \ucde8\uc7ac\uc9c4\ub4e4\uc758 \ud600\ub97c \ub0b4\ub450\ub974\uac8c \ud588\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uc0ac\uc774 \ucd5c\uadfc \ud654\uc81c\ub97c \ubaa8\uc740 '\uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ud0d1\uace8\uacf5\uc6d0' \uc18d 20\ub144 \uc804 \uc774\uc815\ud604\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc18c\ud68c\ub3c4 \ubaa8\uc870\ub9ac \ub044\uc9d1\uc5b4\ub0b8 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774\ub2e4.-\ub4dc\ub514\uc5b4 \uc774\uc815\ud604\ud45c \ub85c\ub9e8\ud2f1\ucf54\ubbf8\ub514\ub97c \uc120\ubcf4\uc774\uac8c \ub410\ub2e4.\"\uac1c\ubd09\uc744 \ub108\ubb34 \uc548\ud574\uc11c '\uc774\ub7ec\ub2e4 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \uac83 \uc544\ub2cc\uac00' \ub0b4\uc2ec \ubd88\uc548\ud588\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7a5\uc774 \ub108\ubb34 \uc7ac\ubbf8\uc788\uace0 \uc990\uac70\uc6e0\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uadf8 \ubaa8\uc2b5\uc774 \uadf8\ub300\ub85c \ub2f4\uae34 \uc601\ud654\ub97c \ube68\ub9ac \uad00\uac1d\ub4e4\uc5d0\uac8c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0 \uc2f6\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub798\uc11c\uc778\uc9c0 \uac1c\ubd09\uc77c\uc774 \uc815\ud574\uc9c0\uace0 \ub098\uc11c \ub2e4\ub4e4 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc2e0\ub098\ud588\ub2e4. \ub2e8\ud1a1\ubc29\ub3c4 \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \ub418\uace0 \uc88b\ub2e4.\"-\uc601\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub9cc\uc871\ub3c4\ub294 \uc5b4\ub5a4\uac00.\"\uc194\uc9c1\ud788 \uac71\uc815\uc744 \ub9ce\uc774 \ud588\ub2e4. \uc77c\ubc18 \uad00\uac1d\ub4e4\uacfc \uc11e\uc5ec \uc549\uc740 \uc790\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\ud654\ub97c \ucc98\uc74c \ubd24\ub294\ub370 \ubc18\uc751\uc774 \uc790\uafb8 \uc2e0\uacbd\uc4f0\uc774\ub354\ub77c. \uc0dd\uac01\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub108\ubb34 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc6c3\uc5b4 \uc8fc\uc154\uc11c \ub180\ub790\ub2e4. \uc57c\uc2ec\ucc28\uac8c \uc900\ube44\ud55c \uc2e0\uc774 \ub05d\ub0a0 \ub54c\ub9c8\ub2e4 '\ub2e4\ud589\uc774\ub2e4, \uc7ac\ubbf8\uc788\ub098\ubd10' \ud588\ub2e4.(\uc6c3\uc74c) \ud2b9\ud788 \ub0b4 \uc55e\uc5d0 \ub300\ud559\uc0dd \ubd84\uc774 \uc549\uc544 \uacc4\uc168\ub294\ub370 \uadf8 \ubd84 \ub9ac\uc561\uc158\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\ub290\ub77c \uc601\ud654\ub97c \uc81c\ub300\ub85c \ubabb \ubd24\ub2e4.\"-'\uc774\ud63c\uc2dd'\uc774 \uba54\uc778 \uc18c\uc7ac\ub2e4.\"\ud604\uc2e4\uc5d0\uc120 \ub9d0\ub3c4 \uc548\ub418\ub294 \uc77c\uc774\ub2e4. \ud558\ud558. \uadfc\ub370 \uadf8\ub807\uac8c \ub9d0\ud560 \uc218 \ubc16\uc5d0 \uc5c6\uc5c8\ub358 \uc120\uc601\ubd80\ud130 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub2c8 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc0c1\ud669\ub3c4 \uac19\uc774 \uc774\ud574\uac00 \uac00\ub354\ub77c. \uc120\uc601\uc740 \ub0a8\ud3b8 \ud604\uc6b0\uc640 \uc774\ud63c\ud558\uace0 \uc2f6\uc5b4\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uac83 \uac19\uc558\ub2e4. \uc774\ud63c\ud558\uae30 \uc2eb\uc740\ub370 \uc21c\uc804\ud788 \uc790\uc874\uc2ec \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 '\uc774\ud63c\ud558\uae30 \uc2eb\ub2e4'\ub294 \ub9d0\uc740 \ubabb\ud558\uace0 '\uc774\ud63c\uc2dd \ud574\uc918. \uadf8\ub7fc \uc774\ud63c \ud574\uc904\uac8c'\ub77c\uace0 \ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4.
