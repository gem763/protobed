If not the UK will leave with no deal\u201d.\n\n(Image: ANGELO CARCONI/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nEarlier, Mr Barclay suggested the UK could show some flexibility over controversial plans to give Northern Ireland a veto over an all-island regulatory system after Brexit.\n\nHe told the BBC: \u201cThe key is the principle of consent. Now, of course in the mechanism as part of the intensive negotiations we can look at that and discuss that.\u201d\n\nNo 10 is understood to be planning to blame the EU for any delay if the PM ends up breaking his \u201cdo or die\u201d Brexit pledge.\n\nMr Barnier said: \u201cThese negotiations have been lose-lose since the beginning. We are ready for a no-deal, even if we do not want it... If that happens, it would be the choice of the United Kingdom.\u201d\n\nEU insiders remained downbeat about the prospects of the UK moving enough to reach a deal - and fully expect Mr Johnson\u2019s new proposal to be formally rejected this week.\n\nLatvian PM Kri\u0161j\u0101nis Kari\u0146\u0161 claimed it was now \u201ca bit of a long shot\u201d to get a deal done before October 31.\n\nScotland\u2019s highest civil court is today [MON] expected to rule on what sanctions could be imposed on the PM if he fails to comply with the Benn Act to ask for a Brexit delay.\n\nMr Johnson has insisted that he will abide by the law - but has also said he will deliver Brexit come what may.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nShadow Attorney General Shami Chakrabarti claimed he was \u201cspeaking with forked tongue\u201d by saying two different things at the same time.\n\nGovernment sources said that Attorney General Geoffrey Cox has threatened to quit if Mr Johnson refuses to write a letter asking the EU to delay Brexit.\n\nMr Barclay confirmed the Government has been talking to Labour MPs with Leave seats about voting for any deal that is agreed with the EU.\n\nIt comes amid speculation that Mr Johnson could offer MPs a vote on his plans before a crucial Brussels in 10 days time - even though Parliament could amend the plans.\n\nLabour MP Lisa Nandy said up to 40 Labour MPs could vote for a Brexit deal, but that she would not support the current proposals.\n\nBut senior Labour insiders think that the number is closer to a dozen, amid concern Mr Johnson could then go on to rip up workers\u2019 rights and other standards.\n\nMs Nandy added: \u201cIt\u2019s deeply frustrating that for all of this talk about getting Brexit done, he doesn\u2019t seem to be serious at all about trying to agree a cross-party deal and move us forwards\u201d.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nAnother MP approached by one \u201crude and undiplomatic\u201d Cabinet minister told the Mirror that he had demonstrated \u201cpoor judgement and failure to actually listen\u201d.\n\nMr Johnson could be forced by MPs to publish the full legal text of his new proposals today in a move spearheaded by shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer.\n\nShadow Chancellor John McDonnell has ruled out Labour backing anybody but Jeremy Corbyn as a caretaker leader to ask for a Brexit extension - even though the Lib Dems said they wouldn\u2019t support him.\n\nAnd Buckingham Palace insiders said the prospect of the Queen sacking the PM if he refused to leave No 10 after losing a no confidence vote was \u201cfrankly unthinkable\u201d.\n\nBut they added that the move would be \u201chugely frowned upon\u201d by the Palace.\n\nDowning Street said the PM had told Mr Macron \u201cwe have to push forward\u201d, adding the EU \u201cshould no be lured into the mistaken belief\u201d that the UK would stay beyond October 31.\n\n\u201cThe PM said that this is the final opportunity to secure a deal . . . but if this is to be possible, the EU must match the compromises that the UK has made in recent weeks and months,\u201d it added.", "description": "Emmanuel Macron urged him to compromise further and said the EU would decide whether the UK had moved enough to strike a deal", "authors": ["Pippa Crerar", "Image", "Angelo Carconi Epa-Efe Rex", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20527084.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_MAIN-Brexit_4565JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
