Crosthwaite, a former executive at major shareholder Altria.\n\n'As the vapor category undergoes a necessary reset, this reorganization will help JUUL Labs focus on reducing underage use, investing in scientific research, and creating new technologies while earning a license to operate in the U.S. and around the world,' Croswaite said in a statement to DailyMail.com on Tuesday.\n\nJuul has suspended sales of fruity flavors pending FDA review, but continues to sell tobacco and menthol flavors that it markets as smoking cessation aids\n\nJuul, by far the most popular e-cigarette maker in the United States, has been rocked by concerns over the strong appeal of its nicotine products among teenagers.\n\nThe company's colorful advertisements have been slammed by regulators, lawmakers and state attorneys general over their part in the sky-rocketing use of e-cigarettes among teenagers.\n\nDanaher, who has been CFO for five years, will be replaced by insider Guy Cartwright, while the role of marketing chief will be terminated, a company spokesman said.\n\nChief Administrative Officer Ashley Gould and product development executive David Foster are also leaving, he added.\n\nJuul Chief Financial Officer Tim Danaher and Chief Marketing Officer Craig Brommers departed the company on Tuesday as part of the shake-up\n\nCrosthwaite replaced Kevin Burns last month, taking the top job as merger talks between Altria and Philip Morris collapsed.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration in September warned Juul that it was misleading consumers by marketing its USB resembling e-cigarettes as safer than cigarettes, and requested additional information on its nicotine blend.\n\nSoon after, the Trump administration announced plans to ban all flavored e-cigarette products, citing the alarming growth in teenage use.\n\nCrosthwaite has said Juul will refrain from lobbying the Trump administration on the proposed flavor ban.\n\nJuul said in a statement that all employees who are impacted by layoffs will receive severance, and their prorated eligible bonuses.", "description": "The departures of Chief Financial Officer Tim Danaher and Chief Marketing Officer Craig Brommers come just weeks after Juul suspended advertising in the US.", "authors": ["Keith Griffith For Dailymail.Com", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/22/20349146-0-image-a-16_1572387284400.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
