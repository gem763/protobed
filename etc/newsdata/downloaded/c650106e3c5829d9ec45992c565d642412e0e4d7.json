(AP) - Defenseman Brett Pesce and the Carolina Hurricanes zipped up and down the ice again, less than four months after wrapping up last season way later than usual.\n\nFor a team that suffered through plenty of long summers, they can get used to these quick turnarounds.\n\nThe Hurricanes opened preseason camp Friday looking to build off the momentum they generated during last season\u2019s run to the Eastern Conference final - their first playoff appearance since 2009.\n\nAll those years of missing the postseason meant plenty of Aprils and Mays away from the rink. But of course, they\u2019re happy to trade that extra recovery time for deep playoff runs.\n\n\u201cYou play the game not to have long summers, right?\u201d Pesce asked.\n\nThe Hurricanes are hoping a few changes lead to even better results.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to find those eight extra wins,\u201d second-year coach Rod Brind\u2019Amour said.\n\nCarolina, one of the NHL\u2019s hottest teams during the second half of last season, upset Washington in a seven-game series and swept the New York Islanders in the second round before the Hurricanes themselves were swept by Boston in the conference final series.\n\n\u201cIt was a good experience for all of us to get the playoff run and to get close to doing something special,\u201d forward Teuvo Teravainen said. \u201cI like this team a lot, so I feel like even with a shorter summer, the guys are pretty young - a lot of young players who have taken care of their bodies and are ready for this year.\u201d\n\nSebastian Aho was here - and the 22-year-old forward probably will be here for a while after the Hurricanes matched the $42 million offer sheet extended to him by Montreal. So was veteran defenseman Jake Gardiner, who last week signed with Carolina for four years after spending much of the summer looking for a deal.\n\n\u201cAnother great piece to our club,\u201d Brind\u2019Amour said. \u201cThe sooner he can feel comfortable, then he\u2019s going to be at his best.\u201d\n\nDefenseman Justin Faulk was there, too, once again as the subject of trade speculation brought about by the acquisition of Gardiner and the salary cap concerns it created. Faulk said his preference is to stay with the Hurricanes.\n\n\u201cIt happens. I\u2019m not the first person in the league to see their name\u2019s thrown out there,\u201d Faulk said. \u201cI\u2019m still here and ready to work and show up and do my thing.\u201d\n\nThe most noticeable absence: Justin Williams. The captain of last year\u2019s group drug out his decision for this season into September before deciding to \u201cstep away\u201d from the sport to start the year, leaving the door open to a possible return eventually. The move could leave a leadership void in a still-young dressing room.\n\nWhile players and coaches have insisted they\u2019re proceeding as though Williams won\u2019t be back, reminders of him remain at PNC Arena: A larger-than-life photo of Williams remains affixed to the glass outside one entrance.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s enjoying himself,\u201d Brind\u2019Amour said with a smile, \u201cand happy not to have to grind it out right now.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Defenseman Brett Pesce and the Carolina Hurricanes zipped up and down the ice again, less than four months after wrapping up last season way later than usual.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joedy Mccreary"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/hurricanes_media_day_hockey_82291_c0-217-5184-3239_s1770x1032.jpg?8b8f23121690e0737bdb7f9c933479ff63e997a3", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
