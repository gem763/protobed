Yes, says Emirati filmmaker", "language": "en", "text": "The genre of horror has not been much explored by filmmakers in the Middle East and North Africa to date, nor achieved mainstream success.\n\nOne movie producer hoping to change that is Nayla Al Khaja, the first female Emirati filmmaker.\n\nShe embarked upon her career in the UAE more than 15 years ago, when the industry was almost non-existent.\n\nEmirati filmmaker Nayla Al Khaja on set\n\n\u201cPeople didn\u2019t have an awareness of cinema at all,\u201d says Al Khaja, who is now working on her 13th film. \u201cIt was very difficult for me, because there was nothing to do. How do I start an industry, so to speak?\u201d\n\nAlongside a handful of other filmmakers, Al Khaja decided to tackle controversial subject matters in her work, often exploring the darker side of human nature.\n\nAs with Animal in 2016, a movie which takes the viewer inside the mind of a sociopathic father who torments his family.\n\nTo Al Khaja\u2019s delight it became the first Emirati script to be awarded an accreditation at the Cannes Film Festival, making it the first UAE entry.\n\nToday, the multi-award-winning director and producer is creating her first horror flick called Shadow, which stars local actors speaking the Emirati dialect.\n\nBehind-the-scenes of Shadow, by Nayla Al Khaja\n\nIt\u2019s a drama-mystery which tells the story of a nine-year-old boy battling a supernatural illness.\n\nThe tale, which was inspired by the filmmaker\u2019s early childhood, is expected to be released by the end of the year.\n\n\u201cI like horror because I grew up in an atmosphere that was like really embossed with fear,\u201d she says. \u201cWe had strict parents and I think it was my imagination. I just liked to fly with things that have serial killers, suspense, dark. I like to play with light a lot and create an ambiance.\u201d\n\nAl Khaja\u2019s passion for storytelling was ignited by her grandmother\u2019s desert tales of Umm Dwais, an Emirati Bogey-woman who would lure men with her beauty before transforming into a monster and slaying them.\n\nEmirati filmmaker Nayla Al Khaja on the set of Shadow\n\nThrillers from the greater Middle East\n\nTerrifying folklore tales have served as the inspiration for many movie thrillers in the MENA region, and Egypt is home to most Arabic horror films.\n\nOne of its first famous features emerged from the true story of two murderers in the 1900s.\n\nRaya and Sakina were two female Egyptian serial-killers who, along with their husbands, murdered and buried about 17 women in their Alexandria home.\n\nIn 1921, they became the first two women in Egypt to be executed for their crimes, and their unlawful acts inspired plays, a television series and a movie.\n\nSoon to follow were other macabre films including the 1945 release of the Ambassador of Hell, about a man who makes a deal with the devil, and Kandisha in 2008, the story of a Moroccan lawyer investigating a supernatural murder.", "description": "The genre of horror has not been much explored by filmmakers in the Middle East and North Africa to date, nor achieved mainstream success.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/15/94/62/1000x563_cmsv2_2be77f45-acae-54cc-ad81-a7f51b95d5a0-4159462.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
