This is something that we need to be very mindful of as a nation and adjusting our response and more importantly, having the preventive measures in place.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, 380 troops, stationed in Yarmouth, Bridgewater, Amherst, Port Hawkesbury, Sydney and Halifax, continued to assist power crews in clearing trees and removing debris. And helping them were 70 reservists.\n\nThe bulk of the military's efforts Tuesday were to be focused on Bridgewater, said Capt. Guillaume Lafrance, chief of staff for Joint Task Force Atlantic.\n\nNova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil praised the restoration efforts of the privately owned power utility.\n\nAll public schools remained closed in Nova Scotia for a second day.\n\nMORE TOP STORIES", "description": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau,\u00a0Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale and Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan were in Halifax on Tuesday, three days after power storm Dorian blasted through the Maritimes where tens of thousands of homes and businesses are still without power.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5276530.1568111600!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/wea-dorian-maritimes-armed-forces-20190909.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
