Some of his colleagues think he\u2019s got it backward.\n\nAfter all, it is the Senate \u2014 in conjunction with the faster-moving House \u2014 that by tradition has jealously guarded its role in originating and shaping legislation, only later sending it to the president to be accepted or rejected. But today\u2019s Senate, devoted almost exclusively to confirming Mr. Trump\u2019s nominations, is hardly a hotbed of legislative activity.\n\nMembers of both parties say they would like that to change.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very eager to turn from nominations to legislation,\u201d said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. \u201cThere are important issues that are pending, and I think we could produce some terrific bills that would be signed into law.\u201d\n\nDemocrats took a harsher line, particularly when it comes to stricter gun safety legislation they are demanding after an August marked by mass shooting sprees.", "description": "Today\u2019s Senate, devoted almost only to confirming the president\u2019s nominations, is hardly a hotbed of legislative activity.
