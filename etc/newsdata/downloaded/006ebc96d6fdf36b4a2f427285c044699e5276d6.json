protests, which began over concerns that China was tightening control over the city.\n\n\u201cThe government pretends we just want to destroy the city,\u201d said Ray, a 24-year-old activist who did not provide his full name. We\u2019ll be out for as long as it takes to let the world know it is them who are destroying it.\u201d\n\nHong Kong is governed under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula, which permits the city freedoms not available on the mainland such as an independent judiciary.\n\nDemonstrators are angry with Carrie Lam, the city\u2019s leader, for what they see as her pro-Beijing stance.\n\nCheung, 33-year-old protester, said Ms Lam was \"not listening to us at all.\"\n\nShe added: \"This may work in China but not in Hong Kong.\"\n\nAfter a fortnight of relative calm, protests erupted again in the region on Saturday.\n\nMasked protesters barricaded multiple streets, by tearing stones from the pavement and scattering them on the road. Crowds also used plastic safety barriers and metal railings to form the makeshift barricades.\n\nThey also trashed hundreds of shops during the march, including a discount grocery chain, which they said were under pro-Beijing ownership. They also tried to set fire to metro stations and branches of Chinese banks, setting off sprinklers in two.\n\nMany demonstrators covered their faces in defiance of a new law barring them from wearing masks. They also sang the protest movement\u2019s anthem and held up placards which depicted China\u2018s flag as a Nazi swastika.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Many people hit by the liquid also developed coughs, suggesting an irritant may be mixed with the water.\n\nOne water cannon sprayed a mosque in Kolwoon, an area in the city\u2019s north, covering the building in blue liquid.\n\nResidents jeered at riot police marching in the streets. Officers, in turn, told the people they were part of an illegal assembly.\n\nAs night fell the crowds set rubbish on fire in the middle of several streets and officers responded by firing yet more tear gas.\n\nThe crowds have five core demands: universal suffrage, an independent inquiry into police action against protesters, amnesty for those charged, an end to describing protesters as rioters, and the formal withdrawal of a controversial bill allowing the extradition of prisoners to mainland China.\n\nThe bill triggered the protests earlier this summer. Ms Lam has declared the legislation abandoned but it is yet to be formally withdrawn.\n\nShe has rejected the other demands and on Sunday she said a police complaints inquiry will be completed before the end of the year.\n\nTwo people have been shot and wounded by police and thousands have been injured since the protests escalated in June.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies", "description": "Tens of thousands of pro-democracy\u00a0protesters barricaded multiple streets in Hong Kong and clashed with police officers after two weeks of relative calm in the city.
