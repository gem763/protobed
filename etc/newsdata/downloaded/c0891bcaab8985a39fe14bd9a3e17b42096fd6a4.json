He appeared so relaxed that the usually surly talent show judge even grinned at the paparazzi taking pictures of the family outing.\n\nSimon turns 60 years old today (Picture: MEGA)\n\nLauren appeared equally relaxed in khaki coloured trousers and a grey top, whilst young Adam donned a Comme Des Garcon Play t-shirt and Eric, a blue t-shirt and florescent helmet.\n\nAll-in-all it was a casual pre-birthday outing for the family. Simon Cowell turns 60 years old today and in an effort to stay healthy, the TV judge decided to go vegan, cutting dairy, added sugar, bread, gluten and meat from his diet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe\u2019s so dedicated to his new lifestyle that he doesn\u2019t even intend to have a birthday cake, saying, \u2018No cakes. There will not be a birthday cake\u2019.\n\nThe vegan diet was to help him keep up with his son (Picture: MEGA)\n\nA super fancy fruit salad, then?\n\nSpeaking on Ellen DeGeneres about it, he said: \u2018I went to see this doctor in London. We did some tests. And then a month later he said, \u201cYou have the worst diet I\u2019ve ever met from any patient.\n\n\u2018So I went, \u201cOkay, out of the smoking, the drinking, and diet, what do I have to drop?\u201d\n\n\u2018It was easier than I thought, and part of the reason I did it was because of Eric. I realised if I didn\u2019t sort myself out physically, I wouldn\u2019t be able to catch up with him.\n\n\u2018Because the minute he gets up to the minute he goes to sleep\u2026their energy, you forget, at five years old, is phenomenal\u2019.\n\nHappy Birthday, SiCo!\n\nGot a showbiz story?
