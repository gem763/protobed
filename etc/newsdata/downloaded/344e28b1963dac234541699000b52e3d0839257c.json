With the cabin exposed to the sky, it dares onlookers to engage. \u201cTalk to me,\u201d the Spyder purrs\u2014and people do.\n\nHere\u2019s what happened when Penta took out the Evo Spyder for a spin: pedestrians, other drivers, all and sundry felt an urgent need to make friends. Folks ask to swap cars, honk, or whoop. Children wave and smile, instinctively recognizing a thing of beauty. On the Major Deegan Expressway, in New York state, of all places, they graciously let you merge into heavy traffic.\n\nThe 2020 Huracan Evo Spyder is an expensive ride, to be sure\u2014$287,000 base price ($365,000 as tested, thanks to 20-inch forged Narvi rims; a \u201cpearl effect\u201d paint job, and carbon skin, among many other bells and whistles). That\u2019s comparable to prices of rival super sports cars in the same power range. For those able to afford it, and who prize a thrilling racing experience off the track, the Evo Spyder packs a lot of punch in a relatively small package. With the top down, the ride lives up to Lambo\u2019s marketing: \u201copen air exhilaration.\u201d\n\nLike its cousin, the Huracan Performante, this two-seater is powered by a 5.2- liter, 640-horsepower, V10 naturally aspirated engine with a bold timbre. Expect to be heard before you\u2019re seen. The Evo sports a seven-speed dual clutch-automatic transmission, which can be toggled at will.\n\nAt just under 15 feet long and 6.3 feet wide (excluding side view mirrors), the cabin\u2019s a tight fit. Ground clearance is about five inches, rising to seven inches at the touch of a button. Unless the top is down, getting in and out requires six-footers to have a pliable body.\n\nThe Spyder offers Lambo\u2019s traditionally angular, low slung, and aggressive body styling, cherished by gearheads the world over. The chassis and shell are made of aluminum, carbon fiber, and composite materials to keep the weight down and your speed up.\n\nThe 2020 Huracan Evo Spyder's interior. Lamborghini\n\nLambo markets this rocket as a tamer, street version of the Performante, but that\u2019s like calling a cougar a housebroken lion. There are differences: The Performante is more aggressive in body style and aerodynamics, with a rear spoiler for downforce on the track. In the Evo Spyder, air is channeled through the hood to create downforce.\n\nThe latter also has a touchpad computer console system for cabin and engine controls that is user friendly\u2014not always the case in such cars\u2014which Performante doesn\u2019t. Exclusive to the Evo Spyder is the Lamborghini Dinamica Veicolo Integrata, a CPU that integrates and controls every aspect of the car\u2019s set-up and dynamic behavior, such as acceleration, all wheel-drive, and\u2014also unique\u2014the rear-wheel-steering system, for stability control and better agility.\n\nAt low speeds, the rear wheels automatically turn in counter force to the front, up to three degrees left or right. At high speeds, they turn the same as the front wheels for better fast cornering on the way to the grocery store.\n\nThe driver can choose from three modes: Strada (street), Sport, and Corsa (track), the high-performance setting where torque delivery changes to 40/60 front back wheels from 20/80 in Strada. The steering and suspension tighten up appreciably, and there\u2019s much less roll on fast turns. The dashboard miles per hour indicator always reads triple digits\u2014to remind you of what the car can do.\n\nThe mode change to Corsa is tactile and aural: The engine goes from a smooth, loud purr to a deep, rolling growl. The specs say it does 0 to 62 miles per hour in 2.9 seconds, like the Performante. At 150 mph, it breathed confidence, as if it were just getting started.\n\nThen there\u2019s the soft top. While there\u2019s something magical about any convertible, pushing the limits in the Evo on a bucolic and curvy country road will require your entire attention and driving skills, and is all the more fun for it. As for nature watching, leave that to your intrepid passenger.\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s not to like about the Evo: Visibility is minimal out the back \u201cwindow\u201d and when merging to the right. As for ease of use, the generally well-organized steering wheel has poorly placed cruise controls. Finally, the windshield roof line obstructs the sightline above the car. Though mitigated with the top down, a tall driver might need to bend forward to see things high up, like a traffic light.\n\nAdmittedly, any car this expensive is impractical (13-15 miles per gallon), and this one isn\u2019t made for long drives without breaks\u2014your love handles will hurt\u2014but it\u2019s still a joy ride in short spurts.When the Evo Spyder arrives, the welcome is what you might expect if Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni both rolled into town.", "description": "The two-seat sports car, which starts at $287,000, turns a lot of heads", "authors": ["Vito J.
