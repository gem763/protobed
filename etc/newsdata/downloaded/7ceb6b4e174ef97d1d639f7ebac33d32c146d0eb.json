But not everyone follows that rule when dealing with members of the service industry, according to new research.\n\nMore than half of Americans aged 65 and over tip 20% or more at restaurants, the highest of any age group, the survey released Thursday by CreditCards.com found. Women are better tippers than men and baby boomers are more generous tippers than millennials, according to the survey.\n\nGovernment data concluding that women are paid 83 cents on the dollar compared to men might suggest that men would tip more rather than less. But that\u2019s not the case.\n\nBaby boomers are more likely than millennials to tip restaurant servers and taxi or ride-share drivers (63% versus 40%), hair stylists (73% versus 53%), food delivery (72% versus 56%) and hotel housekeepers (33% versus 23%).\n\nWhy the differences? \u201cConventional wisdom says that if you have more money, you tip more,\u201d said Ted Rossman, an industry analyst at CreditCards.com. \u201cSo maybe boomers have saved more money, or they have higher salaries if they\u2019re still working.\u201d\n\nGovernment data concluding that women are paid 83 cents on the dollar compared to men might suggest that men would tip more rather than less. But that\u2019s not the case. Rossman has a theory: \u201cPeople who work in the service industry tend to be better tippers.\u201d\n\nFor many people, tipping is a source of anxiety. \u201cAlmost everyone knows that it\u2019s customary to tip at a restaurant,\u201d Rossman added. \u201cI don\u2019t think most people know that it\u2019s also expected with a hotel housekeeper and a barista.\u201d Or, for that matter, the person who washes your hair.\n\nAlso see: Is this the worst tipper in America?\n\nCase in point: More than half of U.S. adults (53%) said they give their kids\u2019 teachers or child-care providers holiday tips at least on occasion. But a majority of people said they never give their trash/recycling collectors or mail carriers holiday gratuities.\n\nA 2018 survey by the same organization found that diners in the South and West tend to tip less, while married people tip more than singles and more than half of Americans aged 65 and over tip 20% or more at restaurants, the highest of any age group.\n\n\u2018I have convinced many of my friends to reduce donating to charities. I would rather put money in the hands of people on the low end of the scale working their way up the ladder.\u2019 \u2014Russ Johnson, a retired septuagenarian manufacturing executive in Louisville, Ky.\n\nWaiters have a median income of $21,780 per year or $10.47 per hour. While the growth rate for this industry is 6% a year, about the average for most U.S. jobs, \u201ccandidates seeking employment at upscale restaurants may face strong competition for jobs,\u201d according to government data.\n\nRuss Johnson, a retired septuagenarian manufacturing executive based in Louisville, Ky., is a champion tipper. After a conversation with a golfing buddy 10 years ago, he decided to stop donating to charities and start tipping 50% of the bill instead.\n\n\u201cI have convinced many of my friends to reduce donating to charities,\u201d he told MarketWatch in 2017. \u201cI would rather put money in the hands of people on the low end of the scale working their way up the ladder than in some bureaucrat\u2019s hand who works for an organized charity.\u201d\n\n(Charity Navigator, an independent charity evaluator, gives a zero-star rating to groups that spend less than one-third of their budget on programs, and says seven out of 10 charities spend 75% of their budget on programs that are core to their missions.)\n\n(Nicole Pesce contributed to this story.)", "description": "A new study says some people are Grinches when it comes to adding that 20%.
