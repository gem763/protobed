Properties may flood and there may be travel disruption.\"\n\nA spokesman for netweather.tv added: \"There is warm air pushing north over Europe, from Africa up to Scandinavia, plenty of energy and there has already been atrocious weather in the Mediterranean with flooding for Spain and Italy.\n\n(Image: Met office)\n\n\"There is also a push of cooler then colder air from the north-west wrapping around the low pressure north of Scotland. A large temperature contrast and this strong frontal band bringing the likelihood of flooding.\n\n\"By day (on Friday) the temperature contrast will be stark, 6C in the north, low to mid-teens in south. For a time on Friday evening there could be some snow for the higher routes of Cumbria and Yorkshire.\"\n\nTo add to the wintery plight of those living to the north of the Isles, snow is forecast to fall in the Highlands today.\n\nAidan said: \"We are likely to see snow coming down to the mountains, 400, 500 metres or so, accumulating through today and Saturday.\n\n\"The first significant widespread mountain snow of the season. There will be some sunshine in between the snow showers.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nSnow flakes are likely to fall in Inverness and the Isle of Mull ahead of lows of 2C in Scotland this evening.\n\nExacta weather expert James Madden said: \u201cOctober is now looking like it will turn out to be colder than average with more of a chance of something wintry setting in through the second half of the month.\n\n\u201cThere is a strong chance of widespread frosts and the chance of snowfall which will set the scene for November.\n\n\u201cThis will pave the way for what is shaping up to be a colder than average winter with some extreme cold weather events.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cWhile these could start to make an impact within the next few weeks they will be particularly troublesome from December onwards.\"\n\nHe added: \"Snow events have been few and far between in recent years, but this winter is looking favourable to bring snow event after snow event as weather systems from the Atlantic clash with cold stagnated air over the UK.\n\n\u201cThis is relevant as solar energy effects ocean currents including the Gulf Stream currents which have a knock-on effect on the jet stream brining cold air in the UK and bringing these weather patterns.\n\n\u201cApplying these factors to long-range weather indications can successfully allow us to identify cold weather patterns coming up.\n\n\u201cSimilar methods have allowed us to identify some previous record-breaking cold weather events such as those seen in 2010 and 2013 when cold weather lasted into spring.\"\n\nMet Office five-day weather forecast\n\nToday:\n\nCold and windy with sunny spells and blustery showers, wintry over hills, in the north. Rain, heavy at times, along with strong winds soon reaching Wales and southwest England then moving northeastwards. Parts of southeast England may stay dry.\n\nTonight:\n\nMild, wet and windy for much of England and Wales. Clearer and colder to the north with some frost, but also blustery showers in the far north.\n\nSaturday:\n\nHeavy rain clearing slowly southeastwards from England and Wales. Colder conditions with sunny spells following, but also scattered showers, these frequent in the northwest and wintry over the hills.\n\nOutlook for Sunday to Tuesday:\n\nRain clears southeast early Sunday, with colder, showery weather following to all areas. Risk of gales in the northeast at first, and southwest later. Frosty by night; chilly by day.", "description": "The Environment Agency has warned of flooding in Wales and parts of northern, central and south-west England", "authors": ["Matthew Dresch", "Image", "Ben Cawthra Lnp", "Met Office", "Pa", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20720161.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Wet-Weather-London.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
