That topper was made of the same foam that was inside the mattress. I love that topper. And now, you can get your own without complaining to a customer service rep. The brand launched the mattress top (available on Amazon) in every size from Twin XL to Cali King. It\u2019s three inches of premium, breathable foam, plus a plush top layer that will fit on any mattress, Casper or otherwise.\n\nThe Infinite Candle from Year & Day: I\u2019m such a fan of Year & Day\u2019s sleek, beautiful ceramic dinnerware. Now, they\u2019ve launched another thing that I love: candles. The Infinite Candle is a vegan, soy wax free of phthalates and phenols. It comes in four scents: Daybreak (Tuberose, jasmine, orange blossom, lemon), Fog (Sea salt, sage, eucalyptus), Moon (Rosemary, lavender, mint, moss), and Midnight (Cedarwood, vetiver, smoke, rose). The ceramic holder can be used after you burn through your candle, as well.\n\nBeyond Meat at Plated: Plated was probably my favorite meal kit when I was trying them. The recipes were delicious. The food was fresh. It was fun! The new addition of Beyond Meat marks the entry into the plant-based meat substitute category for the brand. The great thing about Beyond Meat is that, unlike other meat substitutes like Seitan or Tempe, there\u2019s no special treatment. Just cook it up like you would normal ground beef.\n\nPorter Seal Tight Bowl: There\u2019s so much to love about w&p\u2019s collection of reusable food storage. It\u2019s so modern and sleek-looking, to start. But it\u2019s also completely dishwasher and microwave friendly. And while I love my Porter Bowl for pasta and salads, it gets a little precarious with things like soup. The new Porter Seal Tight Bowl was made with liquids in mind. Made from borosilicate glass and wrapped in protective matte silicone, the screw-top lid keeps spillage to zero.\n\nRicher Poorer Women\u2019s High-Waisted Brief: I truly love so much of what Richer Poorer does and the new high-waisted briefs are now the only underwear I want to sleep in. I\u2019m not normally a high-waisted underwear kind of gal. I\u2019ve tried a few pairs and the only ones I\u2019ve enjoyed have been shaping ones from Yummie. But these feel more like comfy sleeping shorts than anything else.\n\nScouted is internet shopping with a pulse.
