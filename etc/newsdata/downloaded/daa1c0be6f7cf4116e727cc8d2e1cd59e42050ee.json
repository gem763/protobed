It wants monetary damages for emotional distress, a formal written apology, and reprimand of employees involved.\n\nAbdelrahman was traveling Aug. 1 to Toronto with her team for an international tournament and had had no issues with TSA\u2019s security screening.\n\n\u201cThis experience not only went against Ms. Fatima\u2019s reasonable request to be able to adhere to her religious beliefs but also left her feeling angry and humiliated,\u201d wrote Ammad Rafiqi, a civil rights and legal services coordinator at the CAIR-SFBA.\n\nThe exchange became public when Abdelrahman\u2019s older sister complained about the incident on Twitter.\n\nAir Canada did not respond to an email from The Associated Press seeking comment Friday.\n\nIn its letter, CAIR-SFBA says that an Air Canada customer service manager emailed the Abdelrahman family Aug. 19 to say the airline had updated its boarding policies so agents need not remove religious head coverings in order to conduct identity screenings.\n\nThe response, however, did not address the emotional distress inflicted on Abdelrahman or violations of anti-discrimination laws, the organization said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A Muslim civil rights advocacy group is demanding changes at Air Canada after a 12-year-old U.S. Squash Team player says she was forced to remove her hijab while boarding at San Francisco International Airport.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
