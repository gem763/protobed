(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Uber users who encounter uncomfortable situations such as erratic driving or invasive questioning will soon be able to report the offense in real time to safety specialists.\n\nThe function, soon to be available in a section of the ride-hailing app called the safety tool kit, can alert Uber to a problem without the need to involve authorities, the company said Thursday. That will help riders address safety issues they may encounter on trips that don\u2019t rise to the level of an emergency.\n\n\u201cThe core principle for us here is, underreporting is a big issue in every industry and we want to be able to help with that,\u201d Sachin Kansal, Uber\u2019s head of safety products, said in an interview. \u201cIf a user has a bad experience, we want to hear about that.\u201d\n\n\n\nA demonstration of Uber's on-trip reporting feature.\n\nIt\u2019s part of a suite of initiatives Uber announced on Thursday aimed at keeping riders safe.\n\nUber has faced increased scrutiny of its safety practices in recent months as some critics complain the company hasn\u2019t done enough to protect both riders and drivers who use the app. Many riders have alleged sexual harassment and other types of misconduct, sparking lawmaker scrutiny.\n\nA Washington Post investigation found that Uber prioritizes liability concerns over safety, prompting Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) to demand answers from Uber on its handling of safety incidents.\n\n[When rides go wrong: How Uber\u2019s investigations unit works to limit the company\u2019s liability]\n\n\u201cUber has repeatedly marketed itself as a way of ensuring a safe ride home after a night of drinking,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf marketing your company as providing safe rides for young, intoxicated women is going to be part of your business model, then it is especially crucial that you ensure that these rides are in fact safe. Otherwise, these advertisements serve as a signal to sexual predators that driving for Uber is an effective way to prey on vulnerable young women.\u201d\n\nLorena Gonzalez, a Democratic California legislator who introduced a successful bill aimed at classifying ride-hail drivers as employees, said this week that she also planned to introduce legislation in December aimed at protecting riders and holding the companies accountable, she said, for their inattention to safety lapses.\n\nLyft has also faced criticism over safety features that passengers say have traditionally been buried inside a labyrinth of menus. That company announced a suite of safety changes \u2014 such as mandatory driver education and in-app notifications if trips go far off track \u2014 this month.\n\nUber has already adopted safety features including Ride Check, where it automatically alerts riders and drivers when trips have gone too far off course. It has also added the ability to share trip locations with contacts for live tracking of rides.\n\nUber said Thursday it is launching the additional safety-focused features with varying rollout times and locations: the new on-trip reporting function will be launched in half the country next month, according to Kansal.\n\nDrivers are already required to snap selfies periodically to ensure that they are who they claim to be on the app. Now, Uber will require them to blink, smile or turn their heads to better verify their identity.\n\n[To improve safety, Uber turns to an unconventional measure: selfies]\n\nRide verification is another focus: users will be able to opt into a system where their ride would begin only once they\u2019ve provided a PIN to a driver, who would have to enter the number correctly to proceed. Users could choose to activate the PIN feature at night or all the time. Currently, the app prompts riders to check the license plate.\n\nUber says it will unveil an \u201cultrasound\u201d feature to transmit the PIN wirelessly in coming months.\n\nThe company is also rolling out limited access to text-to-911, allowing riders to transmit trip details such as the car\u2019s make and model, location and license plate number to authorities with an auto-populated message. Uber says the feature would be available in cities that allow text-to-911. The company added a \u201cpanic button\u201d \u2014 an option to call 911 from within the app \u2014 last year to an on-screen area in the safety tool kit, where the new features will reside.\n\n[How Lyft lost the trust of #DeleteUber women who thought it was \u2018woke\u2019]\n\n\u201cThe design and integration of these features into the [user interface] plays a huge role,\u201d Kansal said. \u201cThe number one decision that we made at a company level is, \u2018it is going to be a button on the map, and you can drive awareness to it.\u2019 \u201d", "description": "The app will allow on-trip reporting of safety incidents that don't rise to the level of an emergency.", "authors": ["Faiz Siddiqui", "San Francisco-Based Tech Reporter Covering Automation", "The Future Of Transportation", "Including Tesla", "Uber", "September At Am", "Faiz Siddiqui Is A Reporter With The Washington Post'S Technology Team.
