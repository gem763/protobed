We are very, very happy. She\u2019s creative. She\u2019s very passionate about what she does, and I\u2019m very similar in that sense. That\u2019s why we get along so well. We just have a ball, yeah, and that\u2019s the most important part of a relationship, you know? The reason why it hasn\u2019t been a really crazy sudden thing is just because we\u2019ve been friends for so long...[we] found each other again in a space where we\u2019re both not partying, working real hard, and it just keeps things healthy and it\u2019s good.\n\nHe also adds that this relationship with Miley is unlike anything he's had before, saying, \"Any girlfriends I\u2019ve had in the past has always been immediate romance and so it\u2019s a different experience having been friends with somebody before and it developing naturally into something more.\"\n\nAnd if \"developing naturally\" means Cody writing a poem about \"making love\" to Miley, Miley going on a major rant about people judging her love life, and Cody having a \"huge\" crush on Miley for the past seven years, then sure! This all seems very natural and normal!!!\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Um, what is he trying to say here?!?", "authors": ["Alanna Lauren Greco"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YPRifnw7cMAVIdtHpC3upQ--~B/aD0zNzc7dz03NDg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmo_633/fa7decfab2702809865995d023a196b1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
