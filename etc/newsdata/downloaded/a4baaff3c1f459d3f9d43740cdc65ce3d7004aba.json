I be Bo Peep,\" and he wasn't giving it up, so I got behind it.\n\n\"We found his costume at a Party City and his face lit up when we got it.\n\n\"His dad was less than thrilled but now he sees how happy Jameson is as Bo Peep so he's happy for him.\"", "description": "Danielle Carver Folkner, from Kingsport in Tennessee, says 'my son wearing a princess dress is not my biggest issue' - and denies she's making him do anything", "authors": ["Mollie Mansfield", "Joseph Wilkes", "Image", "Caters News"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20718750.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-BOY-WEARS-DRESSES.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
