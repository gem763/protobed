But they represented less the reality of Indian Americans\u2019 lives and more the performance of Indian identity that\u2019s sometimes rooted in stereotypical story lines. As the announcers and politicians who later came onstage emphasized the community\u2019s excellence and hard work, it was clearly the kind of Indian American story the event wanted to project. There was no mention of the Ghadar Party, the San Francisco\u2013founded multireligious revolutionary group that advocated for India\u2019s independence in the 20th century, nor the alliances between African Americans and Dalit Americans that have existed for decades as they fight for civil rights. Nor was there any mention of how thousands of Indians are stuck in a green-card backlog, how Indians claiming persecution in their home country are currently on a hunger strike at U.S. immigration detention centers, or how Indians are one of the fastest-growing undocumented groups in America.\n\nNo matter how much more complex the Indian American story is than the version promoted by rally organizers, one thing is undeniable: These voters now have enough political power to force U.S. politicians to take serious notice, says Toby Chaudhuri, a former White House strategist during the Obama administration who now works with the super PAC AAPI Victory Fund. Indian Americans, while only about 1 percent of the population, are the wealthiest minority group in America and among the most generous donors to U.S. presidential elections. \u201c2020 is going to have the most diverse electorate that the U.S. has ever seen,\u201d he told me in an interview before the rally. \u201cThe desi play and the Hindu play will be front stage.\u201d Trump\u2019s appearance at the rally, then, was not only a sign of support for a like-minded leader. It was a show of force to attract a voting bloc that knows its own value.\n\nAdapa Prasad, the vice president of the Overseas Friends of the BJP, acknowledged to me that most Indian Americans lean left and voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. About half of both Indian Americans and American Hindus have an unfavorable view of Trump, even as vocal sections of the diaspora love Modi. But Prasad suggested that Trump has perhaps an unexpected opening in 2020.\n\n\u201cRecently, the response of Democrats has really irritated and upset the entire Indian American community,\u201d he told me in an interview before the event, referring to Democrats\u2019 condemnations of Modi\u2019s actions in Kashmir and the proposals from 2020 candidates to tax wealthy Americans. \u201cThat is not going to gel with the Indian American community,\u201d he said. \u201cDemocratic leaders like Bernie Sanders, [he] has no idea about Kashmir, he has zero idea about Kashmir.\u201d", "description": "A thousands-strong rally to honor the Indian prime minister\u2014and the legions of protesters outside\u2014showed how the community\u2019s influence is growing ahead of 2020.", "authors": ["Sonia Paul"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/AP_19265688980585/facebook.jpg?1569243866", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
