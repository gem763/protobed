(Image: Sony)\n\nBecause Ruben Fleischer\u2019s Venom was missing a number of major elements of Eddie Brock\u2019s antiheroic origins from Marvel\u2019s comics (see: Spider-Man), there was a significant chunk of time when the public\u2019s feelings about the movie ranged from apprehensive to outright hostile. But then the movie finally hit theatres and \u2014 surprisingly(?) \u2014 it made bank at the box office.\n\nVenom is far from the first film that managed to outperform everyone\u2019s financial expectations despite receiving generally tepid reviews from critics.\n\nVenom\u2019s not a total trainweck of a film, but it\u2019s also not a film that has all that much to say. It\u2019s a big-budget, slimy action movie with some intensely sexual undertones and a few fight sequences that\u2019ll make you go: \u201cHmm. Sure, why not?\u201d\n\nBut from Fleischer\u2019s perspective, the press didn\u2019t ultimately give his film a fair shake and in a recent interview with Fandom, he explained that if there\u2019s one thing he would like to change about Venom, it\u2019s the way critics received it.\n\n\u201cIf anything, I would have changed the critics\u2019 reaction to it. I was really bummed that people didn\u2019t like it because it\u2019s a crowd-pleasing movie and I\u2019m not sure if there was just blowback against Sony or people just worship Marvel,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I was really surprised that the critics [were gunning for it] because audiences really enjoyed the movie. And so many people who\u2019ve seen it just appreciated that it was a fun superhero movie. So I was a little surprised. I don\u2019t know what they were expecting.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to unpack here, but let\u2019s start with the silly bits first. The only way Fleischer could have changed critics\u2019 reactions would be if he\u2019d made a different movie. Regardless of what a director\u2019s intent with a movie is, once it\u2019s out in the wild, it becomes a piece of art that\u2019s meant to be consumed by people who bring their own opinions and perspectives to the table the shape their conclusions about what they\u2019ve just seen.\n\nWhat\u2019s perplexing about Fleischer\u2019s statement is that while Venom was panned critically, the movie did gangbusters at the box office \u2014 and, perhaps more importantly, the larger public\u2019s response to the movie was overwhelmingly positive despite the negative reception from critics (it\u2019s getting a sequel, too). While Venom was lacking in the way of narrative substance, fans brought their own personal fondness for Eddie and Venom\u2019s homoerotic friendship into the theatres with them, which made it possible for the fandom to appreciate Venom despite the fact that the movie really only threw them scraps to chew on.\n\nDefensive as it is, the director\u2019s comment about people\u2019s allegiances to studios is interesting, if only because of the way people quickly formed their own narratives about Marvel and Sony\u2019s brief split that led to some accusing Sony of \u201churting\u201d Spider-Man by pulling him out of the MCU.\n\nWhat people were expecting from Venom was a movie that couldn\u2019t hold itself together because so much of the story that we associate with the character simply wasn\u2019t on the screen.\n\nIn the end, that\u2019s more or less what we got, but what Fleischer seemingly didn\u2019t expect was that the public would be extremely fine with that. What the public\u2019s less fine with are successful directors who still have the time to gripe about things like this when they can count their money and continue to get films greenlit just fine.\n\nVenom 2, to be directed by Andy Serkis, doesn\u2019t have a release date as of yet.", "description": "Because Ruben Fleischer\u2019s Venom was missing a number of major elements of Eddie Brock\u2019s antiheroic origins from Marvel\u2019s comics (see: Spider-Man), there was a significant chunk of time when the public\u2019s feelings about the movie ranged from apprehensive to outright hostile.
