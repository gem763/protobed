Reuters reported Dave & Buster\u2019s was bumping Beyond peer Impossible Foods, testing instead the new Lightlife brand made by competitor Maple Leaf Foods.\n\nBeyond Meat shares (ticker: BYND) dropped 5.3%, to close at $117.35. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, by comparison, rose 0.1%. Maple Leaf stock (MFI.Canada) finished up 3.7%.\n\nRecently, Beyond Meat and privately held Impossible Foods have had a string of product placement successes, including Subway, Dunkin\u2019 Brands Group (DNKN) and Restaurant Brands International\u2019s (QSR) Burger King.\n\nThursday\u2019s news, however, could mean the alternative-meat industry is entering a new phase where bullish Beyond Meat investors have to digest wins from new competitors.\n\nThe back story. The growth of Beyond Meat has been impressive. Sales grew 287% year over year in the second quarter, and Wall Street reckons full-year sales will total more than $420 million in 2020, up about 60% from 2019.\n\nThe stock has responded to the rapid growth. Shares are up more than 375% from the $25 IPO price, making Beyond stock the best-performing IPO of 2019.\n\nWhat\u2019s new. Earlier in 2019, Beyond benefited from restaurant announcements, as predicted by J.P. Morgan analyst Ken Goldman in April, when he started covering the company.\n\n\u201cWe would not be surprised if a large quick-service restaurant were added as a customer this year,\u201d Goldman wrote in his launch report. \u201cFor what it is worth, board member Don Thompson, who owns approximately 5% of the Beyond shares, is the former CEO of McDonald\u2019s. \u201d\n\nGoldman\u2019s call looks prescient. The stock jumped more than 11% after McDonald\u2019s (MCD) announced it was testing Beyond products in some Canadian stores back in September.\n\nThough today\u2019s news doesn\u2019t mention Beyond Meat, the Maple Leaf Food offering is news for investors who weren\u2019t paying close attention to the Canadian protein company. (The company had mentioned alternative-meat plans on recent conference calls.)\n\nLooking ahead. It\u2019s possible investors might find themselves on the other side of Goldman\u2019s call\u2014when competitor announcements could hurt Beyond Meant\u2019s stock more than new adds could help it.\n\nThere is certainly plenty of growth left in the category. Wall Street estimates the global alternative-meat category could hit anywhere from $15 to $40 billion in 10 years from less than $1 billion in new alternative-meat products now.\n\nWhat\u2019s less clear is the number of companies that will vie for the business. In addition to Maple Leaf Foods, Kellogg (K), Tyson Foods (TSN), Kraft Heinz (KHC), and Nestl\u00e9 (NESN.Switzerland) have or plan to have competitive offerings soon\u2014in addition to myriad private players trying to break into the new industry.\n\nBeyond Meat reports third-quarter numbers on Oct. 28. Almost 50% of shares outstanding are sold short by bearish investors betting the stock price will go down. That level of short interest is multiple times the average company\u2014and means that investors should steel themselves for a bumpy ride.\n\nWrite to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com", "description": "The alternative-meat industry could be entering a new phase where bullish Beyond Meat investors have to digest wins from new rivals.", "authors": ["Al Root"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-76337/social", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
