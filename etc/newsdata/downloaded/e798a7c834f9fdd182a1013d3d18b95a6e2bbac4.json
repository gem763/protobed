He finished with 34 goals to break the Major League Soccer single-season record of 31 set last year by Atlanta\u2019s Josef Martinez.\n\nLAFC, already the Supporters\u2019 Shield winners, also set the league\u2019s single-season record for points with 72, one better than the New York Red Bulls\u2019 record last season.\n\n\u201cThe most points in the history is really important because we showed how good we are,\u201d Vela said afterward. \u201cIt shows how good our chemistry is but we want more. If we don\u2019t win the MLS Cup then the record is nothing so we have to keep working.\u201d\n\nLAFC also tied the MLS single-season record for goals with 85 this season, matching the 1998 LA Galaxy.\n\nThe Bob Bradley-led team finished atop the Western Conference for a first-round bye in the playoffs, which were set on Sunday when all 12 league matches were played simultaneously.\n\nFour teams went into the day vying for the final two playoff sports in the West. The Portland Timbers defeated the San Jose Earthquakes 3-1 in a win-and-in match, while Dallas routed Sporting Kansas City 6-0 to secure the seventh and final playoff spot.\n\n\u201cThis was one of our team goals at the beginning of the season,\u201d Dallas coach Luchi Gonzalez said. \u201cWe just entered the playoffs so this is a step in the right direction, it feels good, but after tonight it is done and we can either be content and happy to be in the playoffs, or we can be hungry for more, so we have the opportunity to gain momentum and to do something about that to gain more and earn more.\u201d\n\nThe Rapids had needed a victory over LAFC and help from other results to make the field. The game was the last for Colorado goalkeeper Tim Howard, who is retiring after a stellar club career that included stints with Manchester United and Everton. He has been with the Rapids since 2016.\n\nIn the West\u2019s first-round matches, Seattle (2) hosts Dallas (5), RSL (3) hosts the Timbers (6) and Minnesota (4) hosts the Galaxy (5). The playoffs are set to open on Oct. 19.\n\nIn the Eastern Conference, NYCFC finished atop the standings for the first-round bye. Defending MLS Cup champion Atlanta (2) hosts New England (7), Philadelphia (3) hosts the Red Bulls (6) and Toronto (4) hosts D.C. United (5).\n\nClose behind Vela in the race for the Golden Boot was Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who finished the regular season with 30 goals for the Galaxy. Los Angeles needed a victory in Houston to secure home-field advantage, but fell 4-2.\n\nThat game was the last for Dynamo defender DaMarcus Beasley, who is also retiring after a 20-year club career. He left the game in the 89th minute to a standing ovation.\n\nSan Jose\u2019s Chris Wondolowski, who broke Landon Donovan\u2019s MLS record for career goals this season, scored Sunday to bring his total to 159. Afterward, the 15-year league veteran was undecided about his future. The Earthquakes were eliminated from the playoffs with the loss to the Timbers.\n\n\u201cThese are a great group of guys. I enjoy going in there every day, I enjoy practice. That\u2019s why I do need to reflect on this year and then decide the future,\u201d Wondolowski said. \u201cTalk with the fam, talk with the wife, decide where to go from here. But at the same time, I had an absolute blast.\u201d\n\nThe final standings took on greater weight this season under the league\u2019s new playoff format. MLS shortened its season by a month this year, going to single-elimination playoffs and setting the MLS Cup final on Nov. 10 - its earliest finish since 2002. Because the league expanded to 24 teams, MLS also expanded the playoffs to include 14 teams, seven from each conference.\n\nThe all-knockout postseason replaces the two-legged format for the conference semifinals and finals that the league started using in 2003.\n\nIn making the change, MLS Commissioner Don Garber said the new format rewards top regular-season records because they\u2019ll get greater home-field advantage. The shorter season will also ensure down the road that MLS wraps up before the start of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, set to start on Nov. 21.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Carlos Vela and LAFC made MLS history on Decision Day.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Anne M.
