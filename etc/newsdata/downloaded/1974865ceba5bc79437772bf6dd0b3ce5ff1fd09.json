It was admitted to the United Nations in 1955.\n\nFaced with hostile international opinion, Franco never travelled abroad. Instead, he led an austere existence at his residence, Madrid's Pardo Palace, with his wife and daughter.\n\nIn 1969 Franco named Prince Juan Carlos as his successor. \"Franco himself knew that Francoism would not survive him,\" Juan Carlos would say later.\n\nIn September 1975 a firing squad executed the last six men to be sentenced to death during Franco's dictatorship, despite international protests.\n\nOn November 20, 1975, Franco himself was dead, following a protracted illness and aged nearly 83.\n\nJuan Carlos was proclaimed king two days later.", "description": "For 36 years General Francisco Franco, whose remains are to be exhumed on Thursday, ruled Spain with an iron fist during one of Europe's longest dictatorships.  - Military man - Franco was born into a navy family on December 4, 1892 at El Ferrol in the northwestern province of Galicia.
