Still, the letter is the harshest rebuke from the international financial community since the country came under scrutiny this summer for spikes in deforestation and fires in the world\u2019s largest rainforest.\n\n[Putting out the Amazon fires isn\u2019t just a physical challenge \u2014 it\u2019s a political one]\n\nDeforestation rates in the Amazon have nearly doubled since Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro took office in January. The former fringe lawmaker campaigned last year on promises to cut environmental red tape and spur development in the Amazon \u2014 a message that found an audience in a nation mired in years of economic stagnation.\n\nIn August alone, Brazil\u2019s National Institute for Space Research detected over 30,000 fires in the Amazon, triple the number for the same month in 2018. Bolsonaro has denounced government data as \u201clies,\u201d and fired the agency\u2019s head this summer after an unfavorable report.\n\nIn response to the letter, Ot\u00e1vio R\u00eago Barros, a spokesman for the Bolsonaro administration, told reporters on Wednesday that the government was \u201cadopting all measures to deal with the fire and deforestation crisis.\u201d\n\nBolsonaro sent hundreds of soldiers to fight the fires and crack down on illegal deforestation. But the president also pushed back on calls for international collaboration in the effort: As fires spiked across the Amazon last month, he rejected an aid package offered by the Group of Seven and told foreign leaders to mind their own business.\n\nScientists call the Amazon the lungs of the planet, responsible for absorbing much of its carbon dioxide and emitting much of its oxygen. But Bolsonaro has characterized international interest in the rainforest as an assault on Brazil\u2019s sovereignty. His position has jeopardized a long-sought free-trade deal with Europe and created the most serious diplomatic crisis of his presidency.\n\nIn August, Germany and Norway froze tens of millions of dollars in assistance for the Amazon after Bolsonaro said he would use the funds to aid farmers occupying the region. Soon, Finland called for a boycott of Brazilian beef in Europe. Then North Face, Timberland and H&M announced that they would no longer buy Brazilian leather because of the cattle industry\u2019s effect on deforestation.\n\n\u201cThere is a legitimate worry amongst international investors about how business is being conducted, and that fear is growing,\u201d said Marcos Lisboa, former president of Itau Unibanco, one of Brazil\u2019s largest banks, and the head of Insper, a business university in Sao Paulo. The letter, he said, could make it harder for businesses in the farming and mining industry to gain access to financial resources.\n\n[The Amazon is burning. Bolsonaro says his critics are setting the fires, to make him look bad.]\n\nThe letter was signed by investors including Amundi, Europe\u2019s largest asset manager; pension funds in Norway, Sweden and Switzerland; and the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System.\n\n\u201cTheir worry is that they will invest in a company that doesn\u2019t have adequate control of its suppliers and in the future discover that its raw materials come from illegal deforestation. The company could be affected, and it could impact the fund\u2019s returns,\u201d said Joelson Sampaio, an economist at Brazil\u2019s Getulio Vargas Foundation, a university in Sao Paulo. \u201cIt reflects a growing concern about the environment not only as it relates to Brazil but in the rest of the world.\u201d\n\nBolsonaro is expected to address the international community next week at the U.N. General Assembly. Barros said the president planned to \u201cdeconstruct this narrative, particularly abroad, that Brazil is not interested in the Amazon, doesn\u2019t take care of the environment and is not interested in it.\u201d\n\nBut in a television interview this week, Bolsonaro said he saw the speech as an opportunity to reassert Brazil\u2019s sovereignty over the Amazon.\n\nBolsonaro\u2019s critics welcomed the letter as a sign that the market can no longer ignore Brazil\u2019s environmental issues.\n\n\u201cWe are facing a two-pronged defeat in the government \u2014 we are losing both the forest and the country\u2019s image,\u201d said Marcio Astrini, Greenpeace\u2019s public policy coordinator. \u201cThat loss of image will be expensive. It will cost business.\n\n\u201cThere is a parallel between environmental preservation and the preservation of the markets. Both take a long time to build but a short time to destroy. And Bolsonaro\u2019s destructive capacity is unprecedented.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nWhat you need to know about the Amazon rainforest fires\n\nIllegal miners, feeling betrayed, call on Bolsonaro to end environmental crackdown in Amazon\n\nAmazon fires could accelerate global warming and cause lasting harm to a cradle of biodiversity\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "A group of more than 200 funds called on businesses to play an active role in halting the degradation of the rainforest.", "authors": ["Marina Lopes", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/mXy30z05wmo2AXMkLZzYANJuUcA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/B4QSTWG3AII6TJUIGA3JH62LBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
