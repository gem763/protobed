Do you want to feel part of the bread-making process or have it fully automated, with \u2013 for instance \u2013 an automatic dispenser for yeast, nuts and fruit?\n\nOr do you want to delve beyond the likes of bread \u2013 some machines can make pasta and cakes, even yoghurt and jams? Check it has enough of the extra features you\u2019d find handy, such as a keep-warm function.\n\nAlso consider how much space you have in your kitchen \u2013 some bread makers are more compact, others are huge.\n\nWe took all these criteria into account during testing, but ultimately we judged the bread makers on the final result and how easy it was to achieve.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

Results are reasonably fast and just as you\u2019d hope \u2013 flavoursome, well risen, nice crust etc \u2013 even when using the delay timer. The viewing window means you can check progress at any time, the kneading paddle stays put in the machine not the bread (less usual than you might think) and you won\u2019t be short of options that stray beyond bread such as cake, pizza dough, yoghurt and jams. We liked the 24 recipes, which are all spot on, and that you can keep your bread ready in the morning if you\u2019re not ready when it is. Be warned it\u2019s noisy and there\u2019s no automatic yeast, fruit and nut dispenser, but for an everyday option this is a fabulous all-rounder.\n\nBuy now\n\nTower gluten-free digital bread maker: \u00a387.99, Tower\n\nRare is the cafe that doesn\u2019t cater for the gluten-free these days, and supermarket shelves are stacked with options. But that shouldn\u2019t stop you having a go at your very own homemade gluten-free delights and here\u2019s a machine that has a program dedicated to just that. It\u2019s an affordable and intuitive machine and the results are impressive. You can delay the loaf if you want to make it overnight and you can keep the loaf warm if you\u2019re not quite ready for it. You get three loaf sizes and crust finishes, and all the usual settings, including for everything from whole-wheat to French loaf, and even a rapid loaf in under an hour, but it makes some pretty weird noises and the paddle can get stuck sometimes.\n\nBuy now\n\nPanasonic stainless steel sourdough bread maker: \u00a3249.99, Lakeland\n\nDefinitely not one for those who only want the basics, this all-singing, all-dancing machine has a whopping 37 programs including options for sourdough, rye bread, brioche, gluten free bread and artisan loaves \u2013 all in different sizes. And it doesn\u2019t stop at bread, also excelling at pasta and cakes. We weren\u2019t disappointed with any of the results and despite the number of bells and whistles, it\u2019s intuitive, quick to use and has plenty of practical features to work your bread making around your lifestyle, including delay-timer and keep-warm. The automatic yeast and fruit and nut dispensing features mean you don\u2019t have to work out when to drop them in, the paddle doesn\u2019t get stuck and it\u2019s quiet. But it\u2019s big and heavy so you\u2019ll need to sacrifice a fair bit of your workspace and it\u2019s not the fastest, with brown bread, for example, taking five hours.\n\nBuy now\n\nCuisinart automatic bread maker CBK250U: \u00a3114.99, Amazon\n\nAlthough there\u2019s no special program for gluten-free bread with this modern-looking machine, there is a decent recipe and it works well. There\u2019s lot of other settings too so you can make everything from fluffy white bread using a packet mix to multi-seeded browns \u2013 and you can even set your own programs too if you\u2019re feeling experimental.\n\nThe paddle doesn\u2019t stick and it\u2019s easy to use, with nice, simple controls and illumination, and it comes with a spoon and a beaker to help measure out ingredients for the recipes. It\u2019s on the big side, which some might mind, but that means it can make large loaves. Niggles include the brushed stainless steel finish being difficult (but not impossible) to keep clean, and it\u2019s quite loud too.\n\nBuy now\n\nRussell Hobbs compact bread maker: \u00a355, John Lewis & Partners\n\nA great option for beginner bread makers who want to kick off with simple white and brown loaves (the bog standard white comes out baked to perfection, actually). As its name suggests, it doesn\u2019t take up much room, making it good for smaller kitchens, and we like the viewing window for sneaky peeks during proceedings. It\u2019s lightweight and couldn\u2019t be simpler to use, and you can bung everything in the dishwasher afterwards. Despite the low price tag, it has some handy features including gluten-free program, keep warm and the ability to make jam and cakes. Plus \u2013 joy of joys \u2013 the paddle doesn\u2019t seem to get stuck in the loaf as much as with some machines. But with 12 programs, it\u2019s not as comprehensive as most and we found it rattled a bit during certain stages. We don\u2019t think the delayed start is much cop either \u2013 somehow the bread just didn\u2019t turn out quite as nice.\n\nBuy now\n\nKenwood bread machine BM450: \u00a3144.87, Amazon\n\nThis top-of-the-range bread-maker has a convection fan for a controlled temperature, resulting in an even bake. There\u2019s a handy rapid bake too, which takes just under an hour from start to finish, as well as an all-important dispenser and impressive 15 settings. It comes with a recipe booklet to get you started and it\u2019s all displayed in a reasonably quiet, slick, silver box, with easy to use touchscreen controls.\n\nBuy now\n\nPanasonic bread maker SD-ZP2000KXC croustina: \u00a3129, Amazon\n\nThis isn\u2019t as versatile as most bread makers despite coming in at more than \u00a3100, but it\u2019s just the ticket for those who fancy themselves as artisan bread makers, creating hard-crust loaves with you feeling at the very heart of the process. In fact, seven of the 18 programs create crispy crusts that you\u2019ll find in the best bakers, thanks to an innovative kneading process, oval pan and oven-like heating. We weren\u2019t just impressed with most of the results, but positive excited, although the gluten-free and brioche loaves weren\u2019t quite up to scratch. You can make cake and jam too. As with most Panasonic machines, it\u2019s on the slow side, but that said the rapid-bake speeds things up and it does its job silently and is easy to clean afterwards. The delay timer works well, but because there\u2019s no dispenser, you\u2019ll need to add in the likes of yeast, fruit and nuts yourself. However, as we said, this keeps you in the driving seat more than most machines, which will suit many down to the ground.\n\nBuy now\n\nLakeland bread maker and scales: \u00a3134.99, Lakeland\n\nOne for the keen baker, this model took up the most space in our kitchen, but does come with a couple of extra handy gadgets.\n\nFirstly the stand allows you to get creative with mini-baguettes or rolls instead of your standard loaf, while the detachable scales fit neatly on top and allow for extra precision. There\u2019s a recipe book included if you\u2019re looking for guidance and an automatic dispenser for a more experimental loaf \u2013 we tried sundried tomatoes, which worked a treat. There are 12 pre-set programs to choose from including an ultra-quick setting \u2013 a 700g loaf will cook in 1 hour and 28 minutes. Or if you have longer, there\u2019s the option of a creating a larger 1kg loaf.\n\nBuy now\n\nSage the custom loaf: \u00a3196, John Lewis & Partners\n\nThis clever little machine can make 500g, 750g, 1kg and 1.25kg loaves \u2013 the widest choice from any of the machines we put to the test. The large LCD interface was easy to use, with a turn-dial to make your selection with. Like some of the other premium models, this comes with a chute for adding extra ingredients at the most appropriate time. There is also the widest variety of crust settings \u2013 from light to crunchy. We were very happy with our simple loaf and the kneading paddle didn\u2019t get stuck once.\n\nBuy now\n\nJudge digital bread baker: \u00a354.93, Amazon\n\nThis basic bread-maker has the ability to make either a 700g or 1kg loaf with a choice of light, medium or dark crusts. There are 15 pre-set programs, including gluten-free but unfortunately no recipe booklet. Instead it suggests using a bread mix, which felt like cheating but did result in a beautifully golden loaf without any fuss With a soft middle and chewy crust, the bread slid out of the non-stick pan easily and the large buttons were easy to understand and program.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Bread makers\n\nThere are whizzier bread makers than the Morphy Richards homebake breadmaker 502001, but for delicious, great looking fresh everyday bread \u2013 made by an intuitive machine \u2013 we reckon this has the edge. For those who want to experiment, we\u2019d recommend the Panasonic bread maker SD-ZP2000KXC croustina \u2013 you\u2019ll have hours of fun creating all kinds of less conventional loaves.
