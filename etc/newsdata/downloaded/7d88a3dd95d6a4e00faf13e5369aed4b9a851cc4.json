After a failed attempt at surgery and several rounds of chemotherapy, our boy Valentino survived.\n\n\u201cSadly, he is not speaking yet after the treatment and I don\u2019t think he will for a very long\n\ntime. But that\u2019s fine with us because he is alive.\u201d\n\nNovelli told how leaving Michelle, 43, \u00adValentino, other sons Jean, 11, Jacques, seven, and grown-up daughter Christina from his first marriage to go on the show in aid of Stand Up to Cancer took its toll on him.\n\nHe and Zilli were aiming to get their hands on a share of \u00a3100,000 for the charity.\n\nNovelli said: \u201cIn the hospital my son was already making noises like an older boy. I couldn\u2019t believe that he had developed so much in the time I had been away.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of being on the run, he added: \u201cI was paranoid and stressed all the time. When I came back, I slept for five days.\n\n\u201cBut, really, the emotional stress of the show was Mickey Mouse compared to what my family has been through.\n\n\u201cWe count ourselves lucky because Valentino survived. We cannot thank the NHS enough.\n\n\u201cTaking part in this show is a way of giving \u00adsomething back. If love was the cure, we\u2019d be fine. But that\u2019s not the case so we need to do \u00adeverything we can to raise more money to research and test new medicines to save people.\n\n\u201cI know what it\u2019s like when you walk down that hospital corridor and hand your son over to someone else\u2026 and just pray.\n\n\u201cThose bags of medicine are poison, they have a hazard sign on them and you\u2019re feeding it to the person you love the most in the world.\n\n\u201cWe would be in hospital and meet new poorly kids, and then come back another day, and their bed would be empty.\n\nThey had died. It was horrible.\u201d\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nFrenchman Novelli told how his down to earth fiancee, who he met in 2007 at Luton Airport, was his rock during their son\u2019s illness.\n\nHe said: \u201cI could not have coped if it wasn\u2019t for Michelle. It nearly broke us both but she kept us going.\u201d\n\nBut his relationship with his friend of 30 years Zilli suffered badly while on Celebrity Hunted.\n\nNovelli said: \u201cWhen you\u2019re in a \u00adsituation like that you realise that you don\u2019t know someone as well as you thought.\n\n\u201cHe annoyed me from the first day. I love him to bits but he was like an annoying child.\u201d\n\nThings came to a head when they were stuck on a yacht for a couple of days.\n\nNovelli added: \u201cAldo started talking to me like I was his servant. I\u2019d had enough and we clashed. I said some things, he said some things. It got intense.\u201d\n\nBut all was forgiven when they stayed at Earl Spencer\u2019s Althorp Estate, where Princess Diana is buried. Novelli said: \u201cThat\u2019s where we made up after our big row.\u201d\n\n* Celebrity Hunted, Channel 4, tomorrow at 9pm.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: The TV chef couldn't be recognised under any circumstances while filming Celebrity Hunted", "authors": ["Katie Begley", "Siobhan Mcnally", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20561672.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS195475704.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
