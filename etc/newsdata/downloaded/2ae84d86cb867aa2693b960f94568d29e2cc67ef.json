Forever 21 will close as many as 178 US stores but continue to sell products on its website and select locations in the US, Mexico, and Latin America, a representative told Business Insider.\n\n\u201cThis was an important and necessary step to secure the future of our company, which will enable us to reorganize our business and reposition Forever 21,\u201d Linda Chang, Forever 21\u2019s executive vice president, said in a press statement.\n\nThe announcement came after several months of speculation, following reports that Forever 21 had hired a team of advisers to help secure private-equity support as executives continued to butt heads with its cofounder Do Won Chang.\n\nWe visited Forever 21 stores in New York City and London the day after the retailer filed for bankruptcy protection and saw firsthand how it went from a fast-fashion powerhouse to a disorganized mess of cheaply made apparel.\n\nFirst, we visited the Forever 21 store in New York City\u2019s Oculus, a shopping and transportation hub in the Financial District.\n\nsource Bethany Biron/Business Insider\n\nThe first thing we noticed was bright yellow signs announcing a sale: up to 90% off, and select items for $1 and $5.\n\nsource Bethany Biron/Business Insider\n\nWe arrived shortly after the store opened at 9 a.m., and there were very few shoppers in sight.\n\nsource Bethany Biron/Business Insider\n\nWe immediately spotted messy, disorganized racks brimming with discount items.\n\nsource Bethany Biron/Business Insider\n\nThere were also boxes of products and racks of hangers scattered around the store.\n\nsource Bethany Biron/Business Insider\n\nThen we made our way to the sale section, which was promoting racks of $5 clothing.\n\nsource Bethany Biron/Business Insider\n\nAs we got closer, we saw that the area was a complete mess. In addition to the bare racks, nothing was in any distinguishable order.\n\nsource Bethany Biron/Business Insider\n\nThroughout the store, products were strewn about everywhere.\n\nsource Bethany Biron/Business Insider\n\nMany of the displays were in disarray, with unfolded clothing. Here, we saw an unmanned ladder.\n\nsource Bethany Biron/Business Insider\n\nThere seemed to be no semblance of organization. This area included men\u2019s and women\u2019s T-shirts, plaid skirts, sports bras, and various accessories, with no through line.\n\nsource Bethany Biron/Business Insider\n\nNear the register, we spotted this \u201cprice menu\u201d that included extremely cheap items, like home goods for $1 and outerwear for $9.\n\nsource Bethany Biron/Business Insider\n\nThe register area was filled with more super cheap, disorganized products \u2014 but no shoppers.\n\nsource Bethany Biron/Business Insider\n\nConcurrently, we visited Forever 21\u2019s only London store, in the city\u2019s busy shopping area, Oxford Street.\n\nsource Business Insider/Mary Hanbury\n\nWhile Forever 21 has said it will close most of its European and Asian stores, it\u2019s not clear whether this store will be affected.\n\nsource Business Insider/Mary Hanbury\n\nIn its heyday, Forever 21 was known for its cheap, trendy clothing. Today, the collection seemed somewhat uninspiring.\n\nsource Business Insider/Mary Hanbury\n\nOur impressions of the store layout \u2014 a criticism of analysts \u2014 were good. It wasn\u2019t rammed full of inventory, and the apparel was neatly laid out.\n\nsource Business Insider/Mary Hanbury\n\nBut it was impossible to distinguish one section from another. The three floors of women\u2019s clothing seemed to merge into one another.\n\nsource Business Insider/Mary Hanbury\n\nIn its bankruptcy filing, Forever 21 highlighted \u201cduplicative\u201d inventory as one of its key challenges.\n\nThe design team, it said, was traditionally structured around creating products for each style (work, weekend, and night, for example) rather than by category (like tops or bottoms). This meant that they often ended up creating very similar products for different sections.\n\nThe company said its design teams would be centered on categories to combat this, to \u201creduce duplicative design and help produce the trendy fashion upon which its brand was built.\u201d\n\nThe clothing was certainly cheap. But online players such as Fashion Nova, Missguided, and Boohoo are selling clothing at a similar price point while rolling out thousands of new items seemingly daily.\n\nsource Business Insider/Mary Hanbury\n\nUpstairs, it was sales mania.\n\nsource Business Insider/Mary Hanbury\n\nThe racks were immaculately organized, but it was concerning to see so much stock on sale. Many of the items seemed to be seasonless basics.\n\nsource Business Insider/Mary Hanbury\n\nAs we headed toward the exit, we saw signs urging customers to connect with the brand online. A quick glimpse on Instagram revealed that Forever 21 has the same number of followers as Fashion Nova and more than double that of Boohoo. Considering its massive following, and that it\u2019ll soon be free of some expensive real estate, it\u2019s possible that the company has the chance to turn business around and keep up with its online rivals.\n\nsource Business Insider/Mary Hanbury\n\nThat\u2019s certainly its plan.\n\n\u201cFiling for bankruptcy protection is a deliberate and decisive step to put us on a successful track for the future,\u201d the company said in a statement on Sunday.\n\nLinda Chang, Forever 21\u2019s executive vice president, said in the statement that \u201cthis was an important and necessary step to secure the future of our company, which will enable us to reorganize our business and reposition Forever 21.\u201d", "description": "Business Insider - We visited Forever 21 stores in New York City and London the day after the bankruptcy and saw firsthand why the company is in trouble..
