USA TODAY\n\nShepard Smith, the Fox News anchor who made headlines for his on-air criticism of President Donald Trump, has departed the conservative-leaning news network.\n\nDuring his Friday afternoon show, Smith announced his decision \"to leave Fox News and begin a new chapter,\" after increasing clashes with the network's prime time opinion hosts.\n\nHe said his departure was voluntary: \"After requesting that I stay, they graciously obliged. The opportunities afforded this guy from small-town Mississippi have been many. It\u2019s been an honor and a privilege to report the news each day to our loyal audience in context and with perspective, without fear or favor.\"\n\nHis emotional on-air speech continued: \"Even in our currently polarized nation, it's my hope that the facts will win the day, that the truth will always matter, that journalism and journalists will thrive.\"\n\nSmith, the network's chief news anchor and managing editor of its breaking news unit, has worked at Fox News since its inception in 1996.

I had no clue this was the last time,\" he said.\n\nI had the pleasure of working with Shepard Smith for more than 22 years. It was an honor leading off his final show at Fox News. I had no clue this was the last time. Shep has an incredible gift of handling breaking news... I will miss working with him. All the best, Shep. \u2014 Mike Emanuel \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@MikeEmanuelFox) October 11, 2019\n\nSmith's departure comes two days after Attorney General William Barr met privately with media mogul Rupert Murdoch, whose company owns Fox News. President Trump has been increasingly critical of personalities on Fox News that he views as disloyal.\n\nFox anchor Sean Hannity, a staunch Trump supporter who's clashed with Smith on air, tweeted, \"I\u2019ve always said there is nobody better at breaking news than Shep Smith. He has always done great things and I know he will continue to do so.\"\n\nI\u2019ve always said there is nobody better at breaking news than Shep Smith.

Looking forward to seeing Shep crush it in whatever he does next. \u2014 Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) October 11, 2019\n\nFox News' President Jay Wallace called Smith \"one of the premier newscasters of his generation.\"\n\n\"While this day is especially difficult as his former producer, we respect his decision and are deeply grateful for his immense contributions to the entire network,\" Wallace added.\n\nIn August 2019, Trump slammed Smith and analyst Juan Williams. He also criticized the network for hiring Donna Brazile, the former interim DNC director. Brazile forwarded questions to Hillary Clinton during the Democratic primary season.\n\n\"Fox hires 'give Hillary the questions' @donnabrazile, Juan Williams and low ratings Shep Smith. HOPELESS & CLUELESS! They should go all the way LEFT and I will still find a way to Win - That\u2019s what I do, Win. Too Bad!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nSmith also made headlines for opposing fellow Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who declared in August that white supremacy is \u201cnot a real problem\u201d in America. Smith said the issue is \"without question a very serious problem.\"\n\nContributing: Rebecca Morin, Associated Press, Carly Mallenbaum\n\nMore: Jeanine Pirro talks about her suspension from Fox News, rips network as 'unbelievable'\n\nMore: Fox News contributor Guy Benson marries boyfriend, says Megyn Kelly brought them together\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/11/fox-news-shepard-smith-trump-critic-leave-network/3946561002/", "description": "Shepard Smith, the Fox News anchor who made headlines for on-air criticisms of President Donald Trump, has departed the conservative-leaning network.", "authors": ["Sara M Moniuszko", "Published P.M.
