Robert C. \u201cBobby\" Scott (D-Va.), who chairs the committee, said in a statement that \u201cthis decision to eliminate the reporting of pay data is a step backwards in the fight for equal pay for equal work.\u201d\n\nThe EEOC, in an email from spokeswoman Kimberly Smith-Brown, said Dhillon is \u201ccommitted to exploring collecting relevant information that will assist the EEOC in its enforcement of equal pay laws.\"\n\nAsked how the decision fit with a response by Dhillon in her confirmation testimony, where she affirmed she would make finalizing a pay data collection a priority, the spokeswoman said \u201cthe decision is perfectly in line with the Chair\u2019s previous testimony.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs required by federal law, any such collection must be done in a way that balances the burden on employers with the utility of the information to the EEOC\u2019s mission,\u201d Smith-Brown said.\n\nEmployers will still have to submit their pay data for 2017 and 2018 by a Sept. 30 deadline in response to a court order.\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget had frozen the data collection in August 2017.\n\nBut equal pay advocates expressed concern that the EEOC would do little with the data that is being collected this year, as well as about the signal the EEOC\u2019s decision could send to employers about its commitment to exposing unequal pay.\n\n\u201cI think it sends a message that we don\u2019t take this seriously,\u201d said Jocelyn Frye, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress who was director of policy and special projects for first lady Michelle Obama during the Obama administration. \u201cThe ironic thing is that this proposal is going very much against the broader trend, and the broader trend is towards increased transparency.\u201d\n\nEmily Martin, a vice president at the National Women\u2019s Law Center, which filed a lawsuit to preserve the rule, said that \u201cour job is to make sure they don\u2019t take this data, stick it in a drawer and never look at it again.\" She worries the EEOC is saying that \u201cwe had to collect this but we don\u2019t have to look at it and we don\u2019t have to create the analysis\" that would help with enforcement, she said.\n\nOthers also said it\u2019s unclear whether or how the Trump administration will use the data collected this year.\n\n\u201cIt would seem to me, they might sit on it. Maybe they look at it, maybe they won\u2019t,\u201d said Edward Cadagin, an attorney at Arnall Golden Gregory in Atlanta who represents employers. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the same administration that requested this data. It\u2019s the administration that is telling everybody it is not going to seek approval to collect in the future.\u201d\n\n[The #MeToo effect: Sexual harassment charges with the EEOC rose for the first time in years]\n\nMarc Freedman, vice president for workplace policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which opposed the new rule, said \u201cthere\u2019s no reason to think EEOC is less serious about pursuing pay discrimination merely because they\u2019re now abandoning a form that wasn\u2019t going to help them in the first place. When you look at the data that was going to be submitted, the job categories and pay bands were not reflective of actual positions.\u201d\n\nJames Paretti, an attorney with Littler Mendelson who was a former chief of staff for EEOC Commissioner Victoria Lipnic, who voted against the rule, offered the example of a hospital where professions ranging from doctors to dietitians to accountants based in different geographic localities would be put in the same category. \u201cYou\u2019re not comparing apples and apples. You\u2019re comparing apples to oranges.\"\n\nSupporters of the pay data collection say such concerns obscure the intent of the rule. \u201cThis data is not meant to provide definitive proof that pay discrimination is happening; it\u2019s meant to be a system that provides some red flags,\u201d said NWLC\u2019s Martin. Employers would be compared to their peers, and if differences in race and gender wage gaps are found, \"that\u2019s a signal that maybe it\u2019s time to look a little more closely.\u201d\n\n[Why some workers are seeing unexpected pay raises]\n\nPay data is of particular value, Frye said, because it is so hard to access. The EEOC is driven by employee complaints, she said, and the hope was the agency could use the data to more proactively spot warning signs that might be worth investigating.\n\nDeborah Vagins, senior vice president of public policy and research at the American Association of University Women, who was formerly the chief of staff for EEOC Commissioner Charlotte Burrows, said the decision echoes the business community\u2019s complaints. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you can assert there\u2019s no utility if you haven\u2019t seen the data,\" she said.\n\nProponents of the data collection had hoped it would also make employers more accountable for any wage gaps because they would have to report to an authority.\n\n\u201cThat incentive for employers to do an internal analysis and fix problems that they find is much stronger when an employer is handing over this pay data [to the government] that before was completely secret unless someone sued them,\" NWLC\u2019s Martin said. \u201cA lot of employers don\u2019t want to know they have a problem. ... but if I look to see it\u2019s there, then I\u2019m really on the hook to fix it.\u201d\n\nRenae Merle in New York contributed to this report.\n\nRead also:\n\n\u2018We blew it\u2019: Forbes named 99 men and only one woman on its list of \u2018most innovative leaders\u2019\n\nLike On Leadership?
