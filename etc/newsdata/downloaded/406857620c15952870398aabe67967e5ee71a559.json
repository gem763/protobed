There were also no goals.\n\nThe last time the two sides met in a World Cup qualifier was in Seoul 10 years ago, when the North lost 1-0 before accusing South Korea of poisoning their players\u2019 food ahead of the match.\n\nSon leads South Korea across great divide to face \u2018Ronaldo of the North\u2019 | John Duerden Read more\n\nReclusive North Korea and the rich, democratic South are technically still at war because their 1950-53 civil conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.\n\nNational anthems of both sides were played before the match kicked off at the Kim Il Sung Stadium and the flags of the two countries were on display, the South\u2019s Korea Football Association said.\n\nTwo earlier qualifiers that had been scheduled for North Korea had to be switched to Shanghai after Pyongyang refused to raise the South\u2019s flag or play its anthem. North Korea had promised to provide footage of the match on DVD, the South\u2019s unification ministry said.\n\n\u201cWe would need time for technical checks but despite some delays our people will be able to watch the game,\u201d a ministry official said on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s official KCNA news agency issued a brief report early on Wednesday, saying the qualifier ended in a 0-0 draw after a series of \u201cattacks and counterattacks\u201d.\n\nTwo players on each side received yellow cards, the KFA said.\n\nFifa president Gianni Infantino was at the match and said in a statement that he was \u201cdisappointed to see there were no fans in the stands\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe were surprised by this and by several issues related to its live broadcast and problems with visas and access for foreign journalists,\u201d he said, adding that, for Fifa, freedom of the press and freedom of speech were paramount.\n\nLast year saw a flurry of sports diplomacy between the two Koreas, which fielded a joint ice hockey team and marched together at the opening ceremony of the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea.\n\nThat set the stage for a series of summits between North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and the South\u2019s Moon Jae-in. The two Koreas even talked about a joint bid to host the 2032 Summer Olympics.\n\nBut relations have since cooled over stalled negotiations over North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.\n\nIn addition to the TV blackout and empty stands, South Korean media were also blocked, with only some 30 KFA staff with limited communications allowed to relay information about the game, Seoul officials said.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s squad, including Tottenham Hotspur striker Son Heung-min, arrived in Pyongyang on Monday via Beijing instead of a shorter route across the DMZ between the two Koreas, after months of no response from Pyongyang.\n\n\u201cThere have always been at least some South Korean fans, so it will be our first time to play without any,\u201d defender Kim Min-jae said before leaving for Beijing on Monday. \u201cBut we can overcome and play well.\u201d\n\nOne South Korean user of the South\u2019s Naver web portal said: \u201cHow do we co-host the Olympics when we can\u2019t even watch one single qualifier?\u201d\n\nAnother said: \u201cBest if we win, but it\u2019s also fine to lose. I just hope our players return safely.\u201d", "description": "No fans, no media and no goals as Koreas play out World Cup qualifying stalemate", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/732c6ae332725589320fe72a817bca55cb94aa95/0_77_2500_1501/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0ca240034e0a3be2d18c61297e899d0b", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
