We are reposting because of a typo in the previous quote card.\n\n(Image: sussexroyal/Instagram)\n\n\"Apologies for the hiccup, and many thanks to those of you who flagged it for us! We do hope you\u2019ll keep and share these powerful words from Maya Angelou. The Sussex Digital Team.\"\n\nDespite the error fans absolutely loved the moving quote and took to the comment section to thank the team for sharing.\n\nOne wrote: \"Loving this even more second time around.\"\n\nAnother added: \"Fabulous quote and hugely inspiring.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nA third replied: \"Thanks for correcting. it\u2019s important to own up to our mistakes love you guys.\"\n\nThe original caption on the photograph said: \"Maya Angelou was an American poet, singer, civil rights activist and was hailed as a new kind of memoirist - inspiring people around the world as one of the first African-American women who openly discussed their personal life in order to help others.\n\n\"These words, used in The Duchess\u2019 speech on the opening day of the Southern Africa Tour in Nyanga, South Africa, surrounded by the inspiring Mbokobo girls, should always be a reminder that no matter how big or small, your voice has a purpose.\"", "description": "Meghan Markle and Prince Harry posted a quote from American poet, singer,\u00a0civil rights activist Maya Angelou on their official Instagram page Sussex Royal", "authors": ["Zoe Forsey", "Image", "Colin Lane Liverpool Echo", "Sussexroyal Instagram", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13885752.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Duke-and-Duchess-of-Sussex-visit-to-Birkenhead-Wirral-and-unveiling-of-the-Wildred-Owen-statue-in-H.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
