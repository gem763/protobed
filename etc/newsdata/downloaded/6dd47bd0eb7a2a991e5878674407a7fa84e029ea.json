He needs time to fully, fully recover, so I don't think he'll be back.\n\n\"Maybe after the international break - but probably December before you see him.\n\n\"I'm not the doctor, but there is an injury there that needs healing. It is his ankle rather than his foot.\"", "description": "The \u00a350 million summer acquisition has been a steady performer despite United's inconsistent form", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Image", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Manchester United Via Getty Imag", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20741104.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FBL-ENG-PR-NORWICH-MAN-UTD.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
