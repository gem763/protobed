In their attempt to prove that Donald Trump tried to strongarm Ukraine into digging up dirt on Joe Biden, House Democrats dug some up on their own. The Washington Post reports that a career State Department officer tried to warn officials in the Obama administration about the conflict of interest that Hunter Biden\u2019s work created in Ukraine and with efforts to target corruption. When those warnings reached the Vice President\u2019s office in early 2015, Biden\u2019s team shut them down:\n\nA career State Department official overseeing Ukraine policy told congressional investigators this week that he had raised concerns in early 2015 about then-Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son serving on the board of a Ukrainian energy company but was turned away by a Biden staffer, according to three people familiar with the testimony. George Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state, testified Tuesday that he worried that Hunter Biden\u2019s position at the firm Burisma Holdings would complicate efforts by U.S. diplomats to convey to Ukrainian officials the importance of avoiding conflicts of interest, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality rules surrounding the deposition. Kent said he had concerns that Ukrainian officials would view Hunter Biden as a conduit for currying influence with his father, said the people. But when Kent raised the issue with Biden\u2019s office, he was told the then-vice president didn\u2019t have the \u201cbandwidth\u201d to deal with the issue involving his son as his other son, Beau, was battling cancer, said the people familiar with his testimony.\n\nThe timing on this is very instructive. Supposedly Biden didn\u2019t have the \u201cbandwidth\u201d in early 2015 to deal with the problem, but by late 2015 Biden was all over it \u2014 by his own admission. Last year, Biden bragged to the Council of Foreign Relations about how he\u2019d used the leverage of a billion dollars in US aid in December 2015 to get then-Ukraine president Petro Poroshenko to fire his general prosecutor, over Biden\u2019s dissatisfaction with progress in anti-corruption probes:\n\nBIDEN: Well, I was, not I, but it just happened to be that was the assignment I got. I got all the good ones. And so I got Ukraine. And I remember going over convincing our team, our, others to convincing that we should be providing for loan guarantees. And I went over, try to guess the 12th, 13th time to Kiev, and I was going to, supposed to announce that there was another billion dollar loan guarantee. And I had gotten a commitment from Poroshenko and from Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor, and they didn\u2019t. So they said they had, they were walking out to a press conference, and I said no, I said I\u2019m not going to, we\u2019re not going to give you the billion dollars. They said you have no authority. You\u2019re not the president. The president said. I said call him. I said I\u2019m telling you, you\u2019re not getting the billion dollars. I said you\u2019re not getting the billion, and I\u2019m going to be leaving here, and I think it was what, six hours. I looked. I said I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money. Well, son of a bitch. He got fired.\n\nAccording to Kent\u2019s testimony, this was months after the State Department career officer warned that Biden\u2019s involvement would create a conflict of interest. Biden\u2019s office, at the very least, would have known that the issue had already come up in the US diplomatic corps, and why wouldn\u2019t it? Biden was pressing to get a prosecutor fired over corruption while his son held a very high-profile position for one of the oligarchs suspected of corruption. Regardless of what Biden intended, what were the Ukrainians supposed to think about Biden\u2019s pressure and his leveraging of US aid over the issue? It\u2019s all but guaranteed that the message wasn\u2019t \u201cplease go after my ne\u2019er-do-well son\u2018s patron.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the Post interviewed an anonymous Biden aide from that period, who largely defends the former VP on charges of conflicts of interest. However, he also throws some cold water on the excuse Kent was given at the time:\n\nThe aide said that Joe Biden was dealing with a lot during Beau Biden\u2019s bout with cancer, but that it had a minimal impact on his work. \u201cDay to day the vice president was at work and he was pretty focused,\u201d the aide said. \u201cDoes that mean it\u2019s inconceivable that someone said, \u2018Hey look it\u2019s not the time to raise a family issue?\u2019 I guess it\u2019s conceivable. But I never saw evidence he wasn\u2019t capable of doing the VP role and dealing with his family at the same time.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Kent got pushed aside because no one cared at the time about quid pro quos and the appearance of impropriety. Just three years earlier, Biden\u2019s boss had gotten caught on camera and a live mic asking Dmitri Medvedev to back off on contentious issues until after his 2012 election, when he would have \u201cmore flexibility\u201d to meet the Russian positions. Medvedev had then helpfully offered to transmit that request to Putin. In 2015, leverage and quid pro quos were apparently all the rage.\n\nHouse Democrats stepped onto a land mine with Kent. They may step a little more carefully after this, but it raises questions about what kind of witnesses Senate Republicans might call when the trial begins after impeachment \u2014 or maybe if after this. George Kent\u2019s little bombshell should have Nancy Pelosi reconsidering whether the alea has truly been iacta\u2019d, and just how much she\u2019s willing to expose the previous administration\u2019s own peccadilloes in their fervor to get revenge over the 2016 election.", "description": "\"Bandwidth\" and bombshells.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/biden-cfr.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
