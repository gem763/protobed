This was bad news all by itself, but many analysts are seeing the rejection as a sign of how the industry will wind up.\n\nBitwise Rejection Means a Lot to Analysts\n\nSome view this not as just a simple rejection, but as a permanent barricade to blockchain and crypto-based products. They expect that a bitcoin ETF will have a very hard time getting approval in the coming years, and that this is one wall that\u2019s not likely to be knocked down anytime soon.\n\nThe SEC has commented that it wasn\u2019t ready to allow a bitcoin ETF at this time due to concerns about \u201cfraud and manipulation.\u201d The bitcoin price remains very vulnerable to volatility, and the security of the cryptocurrency space, according to SEC standards, isn\u2019t strong enough to warrant further tradeable products.\n\nTodd Rosenbluth, senior director of ETF and mutual fund research at CRFA, believes that this is going to be the first of many rejections and that an ETF might have no chance. He states:\n\nIt\u2019s not the ETF product that\u2019s the concern. It\u2019s the underlying asset that the SEC is worried about from a fraud standpoint. They don\u2019t want to pull off that Band-Aid too quickly\u2026 I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see a bitcoin ETF anytime soon because it\u2019s hard for an asset manager like Bitwise and others to be able to disprove a negative.\n\nIt was long thought by many that the company that had the biggest chance of having their ETF proposal accepted by the SEC was the joint venture Van Eck and Solid X, which had been working together since early 2017 to get a bitcoin ETF application examined appropriately.\n\nThe company got their first rejection in March of that year, and another rejection had to follow until 2018 came along, when the SEC published the proposal for public comment as a means of deciphering how traders might view the product.\n\nFollowing positive feedback, the SEC ultimately said it would decide in August of 2018, but this was followed by several delays that lasted well into 2019. Things ended rather abruptly when the company decided to pull the plug on its own proposal last September, leaving Bitwise as enthusiasts\u2019 main hope. Obviously, things didn\u2019t go so well in that department.\n\nWhat Can Companies Do to Change Things?\n\nChris Hempstead of Deutsche Bank says that if companies want to see a bitcoin ETF get approved, they need to do all they can to enhance \u201csafe practices\u201d in the trading space.
