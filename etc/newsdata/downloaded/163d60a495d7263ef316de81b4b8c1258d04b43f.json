This is a popular spot amongst families, dog walkers and fishermen. It\u2019s always busy here.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s a play park nearby, so you get kids here paddling in the water, teenagers will go swimming here. You wouldn\u2019t catch me going in the water.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We came here to feed the ducks and on Sunday we noticed there was only one duck and two ducklings, I\u2019m concerned about where the wildlife is.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve spoken to others who have said they\u2019ve noticed there aren\u2019t as many ducks.\u2019\n\nHer boyfriend Gary Walker, 34, who is currently out of work, often fishes at the site and said that he noticed the number of fish he catches from the former clay pit has reduced.\n\nLisa Holmes, 37, who was with her family when the fish were discovered said: \u2018My partner is a fisherman and was looking around the edge of the lake when he suddenly spotted this fish floating near one of the pegs [fishing platform].\n\nDavey White pictured with one of the piranha that was found at the lake in Doncaster (Picture: SWNS)\n\nRegulars to the lake \u2013 a former clay pit \u2013 said they believed the number of ducks had reduced recently (Picture: SWNS)\n\n\u2018He managed to get it out of the water and although he\u2019s a keen angler, he wasn\u2019t sure what type of fish it was straight away.\n\n\u2018But then we started looking at it more closely and saw the teeth we realised it was a piranha.\n\n\u2018We went home and Googled it and its quite clear its a piranha. It was quite a shock.\n\n\u2018We couldn\u2019t believe that we\u2019d found a piranha fish. It\u2019s not the kind of thing you expect to find in Doncaster.\n\n\u2018We presume that it was a pet that someone no longer wanted and they have gone and dumped it in the lake.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, there may be an answer. Expert Helen Thompson said that piranhas attract a \u2018certain type of pet lover\u2019.\n\nTeenagers often go swimming in the lake (Picture: SWNS)\n\nBut when the fish get too big for their tanks they take them to a local lake and dump them there instead.\n\nShe wrote in the Smithsonian magazine: \u2018Obviously it\u2019s never a good idea to release them into the wild, as the species could become invasive.\u2019\n\nThe lake, known locally as the Brick Pond, is owned by Doncaster Council and a spokesman for the authority said the dead fish have been taken for examination.\n\nGill Gillies, assistant director of environment said: \u2018Given the natural habitat of piranhas, it is highly unlikely that the fish were alive at any time in the lake.\n\n\u2018We assume that these were pets that were placed in the lake, something that we would strongly discourage people from doing. The presence of a piranha is somewhat of a novelty so they have since been taken away by the Environment Agency for testing.\n\n\u2018In any event we would always strongly advise against anyone paddling or swimming in this or any lake due to the dangers of deep water.\u2019\n\nAn Environment Agency spokesman said: \u2018Piranhas are not native to England and do not belong in our rivers and lakes.\n\n\u2018These fish do not easily survive or feed at temperatures below 10C and readily succumb to the cold of northern winters.\n\n\u2018Nevertheless, we would encourage anyone that keeps exotic fish and which may have outgrown their tanks, to contact a specialist able to advise on how best to deal with them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It is illegal to release or transfer fish in England without the appropriate permit. It is also illegal to keep non-native species in the wild without a permit.\u2019\n\nMost piranha attacks on humans only result in minor injuries but they have been fatal.\n\nIn 2011, a drunk man, 18, was attacked and killed in Bolivia. A five-year-old Brazilian girl was attacked and killed by a shoal in 2015. And in 2016 a Brazilian girl died after her grandmother\u2019s boat capsized during a family holiday.\n\nVarious stories exist about piranhas, such as how they can lacerate a human body or cattle in seconds and when American President Theodore Roosevelt visited Brazil in 1913, he was shown the power of piranhas when he went on a hunting expedition through the Amazon Rainforest.\n\nWhile standing on the bank of the Amazon River, he witnessed a spectacle created by local fishermen.\n\nAfter blocking off part of the river and starving the piranhas for several days, they pushed a cow into the water, where it was quickly torn apart by a school of hungry piranhas.\n\nBut experts have suggested that it is virtually impossible for the piranhas to have lived in Yorkshire-temperature open water.", "description": "Fishermen have made a discovery stalking the waters of a lake in Doncaster - far removed from the likes of the River Amazon.
