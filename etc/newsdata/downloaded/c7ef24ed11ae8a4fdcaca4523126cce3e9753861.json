The key inflation reading topped a median forecast for 2.9% growth from economists polled by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe government aims to keep consumer inflation under roughly 3% for 2019. In the first nine months of the year China's CPI rose 2.5% from the same period a year earlier, the data showed.\n\nFood prices in September surged 11.2% on year to set the strongest pace in nearly eight years and extend August's 10.0% gain.\n\nPork prices jumped 69.3% on year compared with the previous month's 46.7% rise, lifting the headline index up by 1.65 percentage points. Prices of fresh vegetables dropped 11.8% in September following a 0.8% drop in August.\n\nNonfood prices climbed 1.0% over the period, moderating slightly from a 1.1% increase previously.\n\nOn a month-to-month basis, CPI edged up 0.9% in September compared with a 0.7% rise in August.\n\nChina's producer-price inflation dropped further as raw-material prices eased, the data showed.\n\nThe producer-price index fell 1.2% on year in September compared with a 0.8% decline in August. The reading for factory-gate prices was slightly higher than economists' median forecast of 1.3% drop.\n\nOn month, the PPI edged up 0.1% in September from a month earlier, when it declined 0.1%.\n\n--Grace Zhu\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 14, 2019 22:12 ET (02:12 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
