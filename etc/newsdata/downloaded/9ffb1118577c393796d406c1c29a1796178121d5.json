The team has been moving closer to the Bulls for years.\n\nLast year, the Bulls\u2019 Super Rugby away jersey was in Sundowns colours, strengthening the bond between the two teams.\n\nThe Blue Bulls Rugby Union, which presently owns the other 50% share in the Blue Bulls Company, confirmed through their president, Willem Strauss, that an offer was on the table.\n\n\u201cWe received a joint offer from Remgro and African Rainbow Capital,\u201d Strauss told Rapport.\n\n\u201cIt will now go through the necessary processes and levels of decision- making before we [finalise it].\u201d\n\nThe Blue Bulls Company had a tough time this year, losing most of their Springboks to overseas clubs because they simply could not compete with the pound or the euro.\n\nThe Bulls lost Springboks including Handr\u00e9 Pollard, Jesse Kriel, Lood de Jager, Duane Vermeulen, RG Snyman and Jason Jenkins, as well as Super Rugby players Hanro Liebenberg, Jannes Kirsten, Andr\u00e9 Warner, Roelof Smit and Eli Snyman.\n\nThe only Springboks they could afford to hold on to were Lizo Gqoboka and Trevor Nyakane, while Embrose Papier, Ivan van Zyl and Warrick Gelant were all still under contract.\n\nAt present, there is immense financial pressure on rugby unions in South Africa and, although the Bulls may have suffered most because of overseas acquisitions, they are not the only ones feeling the pinch.\n\nRugby bosses are finding it difficult to keep players in the country and it is hoped that the shareholding deal with Motsepe and Rupert will help convince players to remain in the country.\n\nMotsepe has turned Sundowns into one of the powerhouses of African soccer. They have won the PSL a record nine times and were crowned CAF Champions League winners in 2016.\n\nRupert recently sold his share in English club Saracens after helping them become one of the most formidable clubs in Europe.\n\nSaracens are currently the European champions. They also won the tournament in 2016 and 2017.\n\nRemgro previously owned a stake in Western Province, which was then converted into a loan when the Western Province Company declared itself bankrupt last year.\n\nThe Blue Bulls Company has a remarkably talented group of junior players who this year won the Under-21 title, while the Under-19 team played in the final in its league on Saturday.\n\nHowever, there is concern that they may not be able to keep this talent in Pretoria if they do not have the necessary financial support.", "description": "Mamelodi Sundowns president Patrice Motsepe, one of South Africa\u2019s richest businesspeople, could soon acquire half of a controlling share in the Blue Bulls rugby franchise.", "authors": ["Brendan Nel"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/444/3fbd79893d2e4819a8fcb380b01b74a5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
