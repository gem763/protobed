All that humans had ever seen or sensed \u2014 from the tallest mountain and brightest star to the tiniest speck under the most powerful microscope; everything weighed, measured, mapped or compassed; the entire cloud of humanity\u2019s common database \u2014 amounts to only about 5 percent of the universe. Peebles, building on the work of others as all scientists do, transformed the way we understand the rest of it: dark energy and dark matter.\n\nFar be it from me to explain this stuff. In terms of physics, I\u2019m hard-pressed to explain to a child why people on the opposite side of the Earth aren\u2019t upside down and why they don\u2019t fall off. But while I don\u2019t begin to understand the astonishing work of Peebles, I am nonetheless deeply moved by it and by what it says about the human condition.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor all our theories and discoveries, all our certainty and convictions, we never know the whole truth, and much of what we think we know is likely to be proved wrong somehow. Though the human brain is an awesome tool \u2014 the most powerful tool we know of \u2014 this curious and observant organ spent many thousands of years in total ignorance of almost everything. Not just run-of-the-mill brains in the heads of ordinary Joes and Janes, but the great brains of history: Aristotle\u2019s and Bacon\u2019s, Newton\u2019s and van Leeuwenhoek\u2019s, Curie\u2019s and Copernicus\u2019s. What Hamlet said to his school friend could be said to even the greatest minds of every age: \u201cThere are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.\u201d\n\nThe history of knowledge is taught to children as a sort of dawning \u2014 an enlightenment, if you will \u2014 in which the amusingly benighted theories of the past are steadily corrected, and the mysterious corners of existence are unlocked and explored. I remember thinking as a boy what a shame it was that I missed out on pioneering. All the great adventures had been ventured and every sight had been seen. Yet at that moment, the Einstein Professor at Princeton was working out theories of energy and matter many times more abundant than the whole of my dreams.\n\nIsn\u2019t it likely, then, that we are closer to the beginning than to the end of learning and discovery? It\u2019s not only possible, it\u2019s probable \u2014 a near certainty \u2014 that ages from now our descendants will marvel at the extent of our ignorance, the crudeness of our instruments, the barbarity of our conduct, the childishness of our superstitions \u2014 just as we marvel at those of our forebears.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPerfect knowledge is not just around the corner, and yet we must act as though we know what we\u2019re doing. Paralysis is not an option. The attitude of mind that balances these opposites \u2014 the awareness of our limits, on one hand, and the urgency of decisions, on the other \u2014 is humility.\n\nIt\u2019s in short supply these days. From the blustery billionaires of Silicon Valley to the bully currently occupying the bully pulpit, few of us today dare to say: \u201cI may be wrong, but . . .\u201d Doubt is weakness in the age of the elevator pitch; nuance never trends on Twitter. As a people, we seem to demand of our leaders a certitude at odds with the gaps in our knowledge. And what gaps there are \u2014 in our knowledge of human behavior, of economic systems, of the origins of hate and violence, and so on. The questions underlying public policy are as imperfectly understood as matter and energy, pre-Jim Peebles.\n\nImagine how much happier and more productive our national and international debates could be if we all approached them with the humility of a genius professor (the Einstein Professor!) asking, \u201cwhat if we\u2019re missing most of this picture?\u201d We\u2019d be more open, more respectful, more inquisitive, more inclusive \u2014 all virtues that flow from the principle virtue: humility.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne of the things I don\u2019t know is whether President Trump was being serious or joking when he referred on Monday to his \u201cgreat and unmatched wisdom.\u201d But seeing the word \u201cwisdom\u201d so prominently brandished reminded me of a line in T.S. Eliot\u2019s \u201cFour Quartets.\u201d This masterpiece of ruminative poetry might be described as the distilled insights of a man who, over years of philosophical combat, came to see that he knew far less than he once thought he did.\n\n\u201cThe only wisdom we can hope to acquire is the wisdom of humility,\u201d Eliot summed up. \u201cHumility is endless.\u201d\n\nRead more from David Von Drehle\u2019s archive.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Science has a way of reminding us how little we know.", "authors": ["David Von Drehle", "Columnist Focusing On National Affairs"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/nqmfU3m9g6Tt_GOWcAWcVW-5Mfg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NJVPPEXJ7UI6TEYGI7FQGJH5IQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
