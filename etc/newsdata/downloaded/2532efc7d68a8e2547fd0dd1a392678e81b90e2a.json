It\u2019s easier to mix powder fentanyl in with powder heroin.\n\nDelaying fentanyl from getting entrenched in the west \u2014 even by a couple of years \u2014 could prevent thousands of deaths.\n\nYes, but: This isn\u2019t just about contaminated heroin. Traffickers are also pressing fentanyl into counterfeit tablets made to look like prescription pills.\n\nBetween the lines: Fentanyl isn\u2019t attracting new drug users. Rather, it\u2019s an ingredient suppliers use to cut costs but most consumers seek to avoid (heroin import prices are at least 100 times higher per dose).\n\nThe problem is thus more like a poisoning outbreak than a traditional drug epidemic driven by user demand.\n\nMeanwhile, the rise of e-commerce has made it easier to order fentanyl online, most often shipped from China.\n\nSynthetic opioids are also mentioned in an increasing number of cocaine and methamphetamine deaths (though it is unknown if fentanyl was added by suppliers or taken separately by users). One analysis from Ohio, however, found fentanyl in 12% of retail-level cocaine seizures.\n\nWhat to watch: With the Oct. 2 federal ruling in favor of Philadelphia\u2019s proposed supervised consumption site, other jurisdictions may give such facilities a more serious look. Expect further discussion about improving fentanyl detection technologies and pilot programs for prescription heroin too.\n\nGo deeper: Read \u201cThe Future of Fentanyl and Other Synthetic Opioids\u201d from RAND.\n\nBryce Pardo is an associate policy researcher at the RAND Corporation.
