Anyone can sign up for a card, but to fall within the VIP bracket you have to spend R30,000 or more a year, an average of R2,500 per month.\n\nRelative to such spending the standard benefits of being a VIP are paltry: a once-off discount of R75 for spending up to R350 (which equates to a discount of a little over 20%) and a 10%-off birthday voucher.\n\nBut earlier this year the loyalty scheme got a more eye-catching advantage: discounts of 40% on a limited number of Emirates flights, in a deal that runs until April next year.\n\nThat seems to be the kind of offer Woolworths has in mind for the future. This week the chain told Business Insider South Africa that it is looking at \"firming up\" its travel offer, while exploring \"relevant\" lifestyle offers in entertainment and fitness.\n\nSuch big-ticket and ongoing discounts \u2013 rather than the tactical discounts and giveaways it currently provides \u2013 will bring the scheme more in line with the likes of the better-known eBucks from First National Bank and Discovery Vitality.\n\nWoolworths says it has 3.4 million WRewards users, of which \"about 10%\", or 340,000 people, fall within the VIP bracket.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.", "description": "Entry to the  WRewards VIP club requires spending an average of R2,500 a month at its stores.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9420/7c47b2fa4ef243589dac7d3ca625fed1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
