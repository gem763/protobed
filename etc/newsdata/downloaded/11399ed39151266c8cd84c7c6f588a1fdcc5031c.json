She was in a severe domestic violence relationship that she finally got herself out of a few years ago. She met someone who was outstanding to her and her family.'\n\nShe reiterated that neither Gartner nor Bair were drug users and only devised the scheme to sell drugs to help supplement their incomes to later buy a property and send one of their children to college.\n\n'I don't believe anyone wakes up and goes, 'You know, I want to sell meth',' Churchill said still fighting back tears.
