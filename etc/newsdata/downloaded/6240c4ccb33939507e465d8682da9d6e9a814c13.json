Both carry political risks\u2026\n\nThe Medicare-for-all legislation introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in 2017 does not lay out how the proposal would be funded. A separate \u201cwhite paper\u201d proposed some ideas, like a 4 percent \u201cpremium\u201d paid by families making more than $29,000 per year.\n\nSanders has not shied away from telling voters they will have to pay higher taxes under a Medicare-for-all plan. But, he\u2019s said, that cost would be more than offset by other savings.", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com Politics After-Weeks-Of-Criticism-Warren-Says-She-Will-Release-A-Plan-To-Pay-For-Medicare-For-All"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
