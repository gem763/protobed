(Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nThis year has been all about the keto diet, CBD oil, and probiotics.\n\n2017 was the year of charcoal everything (although that\u2019s a trend that\u2019s still going strong at Starbucks, in the form of the Phantom Frappuccino).\n\nWhat foodie future does 2020 have in store?\n\nAccording to Whole Foods, it\u2019ll be a year of fancy flours, meat-plant blends, and spreads. Interesting.\n\nEach year the healthy food store asks a panel of trend-forecasters (cool job, right?) made up of culinary experts, buyers, and foragers what they reckon will be the big food trends from the year ahead.\n\nAs we\u2019re more than 90% through the year and the end is nigh, Whole Foods has thus revealed their predictions for the year ahead.\n\nReady? Here\u2019s what they said, accompanied by a little explainer of what on earth each healthy thing actually is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. Regenerative agriculture\n\nOkay, so 2019 might have seen us take aim at straws and excess plastic packaging, but in 2020 Whole Foods\u2019 experts think our focus will be on regenerative agriculture.\n\nThis is a fancy way of saying \u2018creating food while helping the environment instead of wrecking it\u2019.\n\nSo the process of farming might involve restoring degraded soil or planting trees along the way, but the main aspect is drawing carbon out of the air and into the land.\n\nThis will be a major buzzword (or buzz\u2026 term) for the year ahead, but people have been doing it since at least 2015.\n\n2. Flour\n\nNot just your standard self-raising bag, to be clear.\n\nApparently 2020 will be the year we embrace new types of flour into our lives, such as cauliflower flour, banana flour, and tiger flour.\n\nStill relying on spelt? You\u2019re so 2018.\n\n3. West African flavours\n\nWhole Foods says rich, earthy dishes containing tomatoes, onions and chili peppers as a base will be popping up all over the place.\n\nLook out for West African restaurants serving up bunny chow and jollof.\n\n4. Fridge snacks\n\nSnacking is always a trend in our hearts, but in 2020 we\u2019ll move on from handfuls of almonds and entire sleeves of bourbon biscuits to snacks that live in the fridge rather than in your desk drawer.\n\nOr so says Whole Foods, who predict we\u2019ll be grabbing fresh snacks prepared and portioned in advance, such as hard-boiled eggs, pickled vegetables, and mini dips and dippers.\n\n5. A farewell to soy\n\nPlant-based foods will keep going strong, but apparently major brands are swapping classic soy for vegetarian and vegan foods made with mung bean, pumpkin, avocado, and watermelon seeds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Spreads and butters\n\nNut butters that aren\u2019t just almond or peanut, seed butters, and chickpea butters. Grab all the spreads and butters you can, smear them over a slice of toast or a cracker, and enjoy.\n\nVery trendy.\n\n7. Alternative sugars\n\nRemember that time when everyone was asking for agave nectar with their tea?\n\nExpect more of the same, but this time with fruit-based syrups made from dates, pomegranates, or coconut.\n\nYou\u2019ll also spy more starchy syrups using sweet potato. Sounds weird, but could be delicious.\n\n8. Meat-plant blends\n\nDo we understand the point of having a veggie burger mixed with meat? Not really.\n\nBut this trend will keep going strong in the new year, with the intention of appealing to those who want more plants in their diet without ditching meat.\n\nKeep a close eye on packaging, as that \u2018flexitarian\u2019 burger might be a beef and mushroom combo.\n\n9. Alcohol-free drinks\n\nGoing sober has been a massive movement this year, and it\u2019s not going to slow down in 2020.\n\nBooze-free pals, rejoice, as you\u2019ll spot plenty of fun options in the year ahead \u2013 think flavoured sparkling waters, botanical-infused options, and alcohol-free gin.\n\nMORE: London\u2019s 11 yummiest vegan comfort foods\n\nMORE: What does Greggs sell that is vegan or vegetarian?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Whole Foods reveals its predictions for the food trends for the year ahead, including chickpea flour and plant-meat blends.", "authors": ["Ellen Scott"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/fff_1572349416.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
