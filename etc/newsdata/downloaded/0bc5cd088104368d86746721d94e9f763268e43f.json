But the motion also suggests that it wasn\u2019t necessary to spend 1,836 hours of police overtime and \u201cuntold hours of non-overtime police work\u201d on the investigation after Smollett reported that he was a victim of an attack in downtown Chicago in January.\n\nAccording to the motion, the \u201cfiling of a police report, in and of itself, does not necessitate a sprawling investigation nor does it, as a practical matter, usually result in an investigation as extensive as the one the CPD chose to undertake in this case.\u201d The attorneys also argue that all a police report does is enable \u201cthe police and prosecutors to decide whether and how to investigate.\u201d\n\nThe police department has said it only did what was necessary and that it conducted a potential hate crime investigation because Smollett alleged that two masked men hurled racist and homophobic insults at him, beat him and looped a noose around his neck.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s Chicago or any other U.S. city, when he reported a vicious hate crime it was going to be investigated at the highest level of vigor and detail,\u201d said police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi. The investigation included canvassing the area for witnesses, dozens of interviews, scientific analysis of the rope as well as the liquid that Smollett said the men threw at him, and the collection of hours of surveillance video from cameras mounted on buildings, inside taxi cabs and from cameras along miles of city streets.\n\nThe city\u2019s lawsuit against Smollett is just part of a larger legal battle over the alleged attack that includes: criminal charges against the actor by prosecutors who alleged he staged the attack to further his career; a stunning decision by the Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office in March to dismiss those charges; and a judge\u2019s appointment last month of a special prosecutor to investigate that decision.\n\nIn the filing, Smollett\u2019s attorneys contend that the only reason the city filed suit to recoup the cost of the investigation was because former Mayor Rahm Emanuel disagreed with the decision of the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office to dismiss the charges against Smollett.\n\n\u201cThe city\u2019s claims and purported damages are a vindictive effort to prosecute charges that the State\u2019s Attorney pursued and then chose to drop,\u201d the filing reads. In an earlier filing, Smollett\u2019s attorneys characterized the city\u2019s lawsuit as a \u201cperverse tactic\u201d because the charges were dismissed.\n\nEmanuel and Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson have made no secret about their anger that the charges were dropped, and after Smollett refused the city\u2019s demand for $130,000 the city sued in April for that money.\n\nThe police department maintains that there is overwhelming evidence that the actor staged the attack and paid his two \u201cattackers\u201d to carry it out. And the recent appointment of a special prosecutor to examine how State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx\u2019s office handled the case raised the possibility of the charges against Smollett being reinstated or of new charges being brought.\n\nThe attorney who filed the motion, William J. Quinlan, could not be reached for comment on Wednesday, and a spokesman for the city\u2019s law department said the office does not comment on pending litigation.\n\nOne legal expert said he didn\u2019t see much chance that the motion would be successful.\n\n\u201cIf, in fact, there\u2019s a valid claim that the city inflated the cost in doing this investigation then the judge can have a hearing,\u201d said David Erickson, a former state appellate judge who teaches at Chicago Kent College of Law. \u201cBut this is a silly motion that\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d\n\nA federal judge hearing the city\u2019s lawsuit has said she will rule on the actor\u2019s request to toss the suit during a hearing on Oct. 22.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jussie Smollett's attorneys have filed a motion arguing that the actor should not have to pay Chicago $130,000 for a police investigation into what he claimed was a racist and homophobic attack, because he couldn't have known how much time and money the department would spend looking into his allegations.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Don Babwin"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/03/31/ap_essay_the_politics_of_certainty_00196_c0-54-2896-1742_s1770x1032.jpg?9acc71020c90df7ccc0823cddcdd4cc7c4c69a85"}
