Photo: Courtesy of TIFF\n\n\u201cTalk about the female gaze,\u201d a woman coming out of the first Toronto screening of Portrait of a Lady on Fire told her companion as the crowd shuffled toward the escalators. \u201cThat movie\u2019s nothing but the female gaze.\u201d\n\nShe was right. C\u00e9line Sciamma\u2019s film, which won both the Best Screenplay prize and the Queer Palm at Cannes earlier this year, is a movie about the pleasures of observing, and being observed. It takes place at a remote chateau in Brittany in the waning days of the ancien r\u00e9gime, as the painter Marianne (No\u00e9mie Merlant) arrives with a peculiar mission: create a portrait of young noblewoman H\u00e9lo\u00efse (Ad\u00e8le Haenel) without her noticing. The reason why verges on Gothic tragedy. H\u00e9lo\u00efse\u2019s sister has tumbled to her death off a seaside cliff \u2014 the question lingers whether she fell or jumped \u2014 and now the younger woman is about to be shipped off to a suitor in Milan in her place. Unhappy with her fate, H\u00e9lo\u00efse refuses to sit for a portrait that will be sent to her fianc\u00e9, thus the subterfuge. By day, Marianne will pretend to be H\u00e9lo\u00efse\u2019s walking companion; by night, she\u2019ll paint the portrait from memory.\n\nAs the women embark on their first outing, Sciamma holds off on our first glimpse of H\u00e9lo\u00efse: We see her from behind, in Marianne\u2019s POV, a shot that obscures her face for so long it\u2019s almost painful. But once they start looking at each other, they find it hard to stop. This is a film about women watching women, shot by two women. (The cinematographer is Claire Mathon, who does for bright sunlight what Roger Deakins does for shadows.) Marianne\u2019s gaze is furtive and inquisitive: She wants to know how H\u00e9lo\u00efse holds her hands, what her mouth does when she smiles, how the light plays off her ear. H\u00e9lo\u00efse\u2019s gaze is something else. In films like Deerskin, Haenel has had a distinctly modern air to her, and here she seems almost out of time \u2014 amid this lush period setting, her look is hard and impassive, like she\u2019s staring down a tiger.\n\nTo fall in love is to feel truly seen, and Portrait suggests the reverse is true, too \u2014 to see someone as they really are is to fall for them as well. Eventually Marianne\u2019s guilt gets the better of her, and she reveals the portrait to H\u00e9lo\u00efse, who\u2019s disappointed, not only because of the ruse, but also because the painting captures nothing of her spirit. She decides to sit for a second portrait, and as the women are finally able to stare at each other freely, their friendship gradually turns into a bittersweet love story. The painting they\u2019re collaborating on is the very object that will end their relationship. A parallel is drawn to the story of Orpheus and Eurydice \u2014 for Marianne to see H\u00e9lo\u00efse is to lose her, but in another sense, it\u2019s also a way to have her forever.\n\nBased on their forbidden queer romances, sensuous love scenes, and striking European locations \u2014 you\u2019ll want to book a trip to Brittany immediately after leaving the theater \u2014 it\u2019s tempting to call Portrait of a Lady on Fire this year\u2019s Call Me by Your Name. But while CMBYN played out the fantasy of two people becoming one, Portrait is more attuned to the fascination of difference, how a lover\u2019s gestures and mannerisms can come to encapsulate an entire world. To watch it is to fall into your own particular trance \u2014 Sciamma fills her frames with imagery designed to inspire private obsession, from the titular shot of an unflappable H\u00e9lo\u00efse with her dress aflame, to the most lovingly photographed post-makeout spit-trails I\u2019ve ever seen, and culminating in a final shot that rivals CMBYN in its majesty. Other journalists I\u2019ve spoken to at TIFF have come away enthralled, and I would not be surprised if, like another romance that played Toronto last year, this is a movie viewers can\u2019t help taking another look at.", "description": "C\u00e9line Sciamma\u2019s \u201cPortrait of a Lady on Fire\u201d is earning strong reviews from journalists at the Toronto Film Festival.", "authors": ["Nate Jones"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/04/tiff/portrait-of-a-lady-on-fire.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
