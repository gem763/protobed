Paul Farrell, a lead lawyer for the latter, told The Associated Press one major obstacle was the states\u2019 insistence on being in charge of dividing the money.\n\n\u201cWhen the first day of trial starts Monday, we look forward to sharing the facts \u2013 and the facts will show that opioid makers and distributors conspired to create and benefit from the worst public health crisis in decades,\u201d the lawyers for the local governments said.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "description": "The first federal trial related to the nation's opioid epidemic is scheduled to start Monday in Cleveland after settlement talks failed.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ad5ac72ad7133687d0f09dbcd9363c485b585139/c=0-0-400-225/local/-/media/2019/10/17/USATODAY/usatsports/imageforentry90-jjc.jpg?width=400&height=225&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
