REUTERS/Sukree Sukplang\n\nThe move derailed Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s plan for a decision on his withdrawal deal, but the pound held the bulk of its recent rally on confidence that a disorderly exit from the European Union would be avoided.\n\nIn Asian trade, the pound GBP=D4 fell 0.61% to $1.2910, having hit a five-month peak of $1.2990 on Friday and closing the week just below the $1.30 mark, a 6.5% surge since Johnson struck an EU divorce deal on Oct. 10.\n\nLawmakers on Saturday voted to withhold a decision on Johnson\u2019s deal, a move that forced him to seek from the EU a third postponement of Britain\u2019s departure from the bloc. Britain\u2019s exit had been envisaged for Oct. 31.\n\nBut Johnson added another note saying he was opposed to an extension and British government minister Michael Gove said on Sunday that Brexit will happen by Oct. 31 as the government seeks to get the Brexit bill through parliament.\n\nAnalysts said market focus will turn to this week\u2019s vote on Johnson\u2019s deal. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC overnight that he was confident enough lawmakers would back the deal this week.\n\n\u201cThe weekend\u2019s events, if anything, have further reduced the risk of disorderly exit,\u201d said Adam Cole, chief currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets in London.\n\n\u201cIf there is a knee-jerk negative reaction in the pound as we emerge from the weekend with a greater overhang of uncertainty than hoped and some of the long positions are unwound, it should be faded soon.\u201d\n\nThe European Union will play for time rather than rush to decide on London\u2019s reluctant request to delay Brexit again, diplomats said on Sunday.\n\nWhile weary of the Brexit process, EU leaders are keen to avoid a disorderly exit and are unlikely to reject the request. They hope the deal can eventually be approved in London.\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS.N) said on Sunday that it lowered the probability of a no-deal Brexit to 5% from 10% and maintained its baseline view that the UK will leave the EU on Oct. 31.\n\n\u201cThe uncertainty is likely to weigh on sterling when trading resumes in Asia Pacific on Oct. 21. Volatility will remain elevated until a clearer picture emerges,\u201d said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex in New York.\n\nImplied volatilities on sterling options GBPVOL= were mostly little changed in early Monday, with one-month volatilities quoted at 11.600/14.200% GBP1MO=.\n\nRisk reversal spreads widened slightly in favour of sterling puts, pointing to investors\u2019 caution over the pound\u2019s fall.\n\nElsewhere, currency moves were limited as investors pondered the shifting scenarios for Brexit.\n\nThe euro eased 0.13% to $1.1159 EUR= versus the greenback, off Friday's two-month high of $1.1172.\n\nThe dollar was little changed at 108.48 JPY= to the safe-haven yen, still not far from its 2-1/2-month high of 108.94 yen marked on Thursday.\n\n\u201cAlthough many eyes are still on Brexit, there is not so much nervousness in the market as the risk of a no-deal Brexit has actually reduced over the weekend,\u201d said Shinichiro Kadota, senior forex and rates strategist at Barclays in Tokyo.\n\n\u201cApart from Brexit, traders are looking at central banks\u2019 policy decisions.\u201d\n\nA big week for central banks kicks off on Thursday with the European Central Bank meeting, the last one for President Mario Draghi, while the main focus is on the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s policy meeting on Oct. 29-30.\n\nChina's yuan CNY=CFXS was a touch firmer at 7.0680 per dollar after Beijing unexpectedly kept unchanged its new benchmark lending rate on Monday, for the first time since its debut in August, suggesting the country is keen to avoid overly loosening monetary policy.", "description": "Sterling fell over half a percent against the dollar on Monday, slipping from five-month highs after the British parliament delayed a crucial vote on a Brexit withdrawal agreement.", "authors": ["Tomo Uetake", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443201796&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K009", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
