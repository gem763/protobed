Consumers in a competitive market should be determining how much is being purchased, not politicians.\n\nThe major point is that the Trump Administration has been following the wrong strategy. After nearly three years of bluster against China, we have a deal that is anemic at best. Just imagine, by contrast, where we would be if Trump had joined with our allies and used the World Trade Organization to go after China\u2019s mercantilist policies. We\u2019d be in much better shape today.\n\nAnd with none of the collateral damage that Trump\u2019s tariffs have caused for American farmers, exporters, consumers, manufacturers, and taxpayers!\n\nTo use a bit of economic jargon, failing to utilize the WTO is an \u201copportunity cost\u201d \u2013 an approach that we overlooked and neglected because Trump preferred a trade war.\n\nBy the way, I realize that there are some people who viscerally oppose the WTO. I hope they can be persuaded to change their minds. But if that\u2019s impossible, I want to point out that Trump\u2019s approach is wrong even for those who advocate U.S. unilateralism.\n\nThere are things that the United States could do that specifically target China\u2019s anti-market policies.\n\nFor instance, James Pethokoukis of the American Enterprise Institute, shares an exchange he had with Claude Barfield.\n\n\u2026there\u2019s an alternative to the sweeping protectionism of the populists and progressives. \u2026here is a podcast exchange from last April between AEI trade expert Claude Barfield and myself: Pethokoukis: As far as the enforcement mechanism, should the stick be tariffs? Should we be going after individual Chinese companies that we feel are breaking these rules, that are engaged in tech IP theft? What should be the punitive aspect? Barfield: In terms of intellectual property, if a Chinese company is found having participated in some sort of theft or \u2014 and here we have to be more vigilant in following this ourselves \u2014 using some technology or system that they\u2019ve stolen, I would ban them from the US market. I would ban them and I would go after them in capital markets around the world. If the Chinese, for instance, continue to refuse to allow real competition and particular sectors are closed off for investment, I would ban the Chinese companies here and again, I would go after them in capital markets. In other words, I think it\u2019s the investment side that is more productive and from the beginning has always been more productive, for me, than the tariffs.\n\nAnd Derek Scissors, also from AEI, outlines additional options.\n\n\u2026there are many available actions which are more focused and, often, stronger than tariffs. But the Trump administration has neglected them\u2026 China\u2019s centrally-controlled state-owned enterprises are very large and never allowed to fail due to commercial competition \u2014 the ultimate subsidy. It is thus impossible for the US to achieve balanced market access, much less free trade. \u2026Chinese enterprises are not accidental recipients of protection from competition\u2026 These activities are orchestrated by the state. \u2026The last step is what, exactly, to do. There are\u2026many options.\n\nHere\u2019s the table he put together.\n\nThe bottom line is that there are plenty of tools available to specifically target anti-market interventionism (subsidies, cronyism, theft, etc) by China. Including options that are too onerous, or perhaps even not compliant with our WTO obligations.\n\nNot that any of that matters. Trump wrongly thinks the bilateral trade deficit (i.e., investment surplus) with China is the problem. So we\u2019ve wasted almost three years with a bad strategy, hurt the U.S. economy, and failed to get pro-market reforms in China.\n\nP.S. If successful, the right approach (i.e., using the WTO or unilateralism to go after China\u2019s anti-market policies) would produce benefits for America, and it would produce even greater benefits for China.", "description": "Because of Trump\u2019s\u00a0poor grasp of trade issues, I\u00a0warned at the .10/14/2019 19:17:58PM EST.", "authors": ["Daniel J.
