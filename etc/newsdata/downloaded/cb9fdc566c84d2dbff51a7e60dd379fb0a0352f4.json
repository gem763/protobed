The authorities say the candidate\u2019s political stance violated Hong Kong\u2019s Basic Law, a mini-constitution that maintains the region is a part of China.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Yet as one of the most recognizable faces in Hong Kong\u2019s democratic struggle, Wong\u2019s candidacy in the upcoming polls was widely anticipated to be contentious. The 23-year-old former leader of the 2014 Umbrella Movement frequently criticizes Chinese President Xi Jinping and has fashioned himself into a de facto ambassador for the current protest movement as he flies around the world trying to drum up global support. In September, he testified before Congress, urging the U.S. to join Hong Kong\u2019s fight for greater autonomy.\n\nFor Beijing, the protests are seen impinging on the Communist Party\u2019s redline that Hong Kong not be used as a base for foreign interference, or for subverting the regime. Earlier this month, President Xi warned that anyone trying to split China \u201cwill end in crushed bodies and shattered bones.\u201d\n\nWong, who has previously been barred from running in earlier elections, served several stints in jail in the aftermath of the 2014 movement\u2019s failed bid for direct elections of the city\u2019s leader. After his release this June, he immediately joined the latest round of demonstrations, going from the prison yard to addressing the movement\u2019s activists and striking students who are largely leaderless.\n\nWong and fellow democracy campaigner Agnes Chow were arrested again on charges of organizing, inciting and taking part in an illegal assembly during a siege of police headquarters on June 21. They are both currently out on bail.\n\nRead more: Five Years On, Hong Kong Activist Joshua Wong Speaks to TIME About the Umbrella Revolution\n\nWhile the city\u2019s district council elections typically revolve around local matters, the upcoming polls have taken on a wider significance as they are expected to serve as a litmus test for public support of the ongoing protests. District councils are presently dominated by pro-Beijing parties, but there is a widespread expectation that the establishment will suffer heavy losses in the coming race thanks in part to a surge in registered youth voters.\n\nPublic anger in Hong Kong has swelled as the city\u2019s leader has yet to provide a substantive political solution to a crisis that has spiraled for the past five months. Initially set off by a contentious extradition bill, the movement has morphed into a wider ideological battle sustained by freewheeling, liberal Hong Kong\u2019s fears of an encroaching autocratic Chinese government. The weekly clashes between a hardcore knot of demonstrators and police have become increasingly violent, and have weighed heavily on tourism and the city\u2019s economy. The city\u2019s financial secretary announced over the weekend that the region has fallen into a recession.\n\nWrite to Laignee Barron at Laignee.Barron@time.com.", "description": "Hong Kong authorities have barred prominent democracy activist Joshua Wong from contesting local council elections next month", "authors": ["Laignee Barron", "Hong Kong"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/joshua_wong_disqualified_hong_kong_election.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
