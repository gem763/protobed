The first one was in Singapore in June 2018. It was exploratory in nature. There were expectations of a positive outcome to resolve the issue of denuclearization. The second summit was in Hanoi in February 2019. However, it turned out to be a non-starter and they could not arrive at any agreement. Later, Trump took the initiative to meet Kim in his home ground in June 2019.\n\nIt was at the demilitarized zone DMZ. Reports indicate that, at that meeting, they agreed to restart talks, which could happen this week. That would mean restarting nuclear negotiations and North\u2019s latest missile launch could be a sort of message to the United States.\n\nSky News says North Korea has expressed willingness to offer partial denuclearization provided the US agrees to lift sanctions and provide security guarantees.\n\nThat has been the point of dispute between the two sides. While Trump wants to assign priority to denuclearization, Kim harps on lifting of sanctions because that is having an adverse effect on his country\u2019s economy. Obviously, there is a clash of interests and the US and North Korea must agree for a compromise of sorts to arrive at a settlement.\n\nIt is the first time in nearly two years that a weapon has been fired into Japan's exclusive economic zone https://t.co/BpQ7X47UL2 \u2014 Sky News (@SkyNews) October 2, 2019\n\nPyongyang shows off its new weapon\n\nOfficials in South Korea monitor the activities of its neighbor on a regular basis and they have said that the latest launch of the hermit kingdom is a submarine-launched ballistic missile.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news!

Donald Trump\n\nExperts feel that if the secretive state did launch the projectile from a submarine, it would mean it had acquired improved military capabilities. Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga indicated that the ballistic missile launched by the North broke up in two parts. One part landed inside Japan's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) but there were no reports of any damage.\n\nNorth Korea fires ballistic missile built to be launched from submarine into Japan's EEZ https://t.co/ty1cKQM4Rm \u2014 The Japan Times (@japantimes) October 2, 2019\n\nSky News goes on to add that the tentative date for the restart of nuclear negotiations with Pyongyang could be in this week.\n\nThe two sides will meet on Friday before proceeding to the working-level talks on Saturday. It seems North Korea could offer partial denuclearization in exchange for an ease of sanctions and providing security guarantees. Incidentally, North Korea has praised President Donald Trump for suggesting a new approach to solve the problem. He has dropped hints that \u201cthe US may pursue an unspecified \"new method\" in the negotiations.\u201d\n\nLatest missile launch was the 11th this year\n\nAccording to the BBC, Pyongyang announced possibilities of restarting talks with the US on denuclearization and followed it up by launching a ballistic missile from a submarine.\n\nNorth Korea was already working on the development of submarine-launched ballistic missiles technology. Officials of the South said the missile flew about 280 miles and attained an altitude of 565 miles before landing in the Sea of Japan. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe described it as \"a violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions which ban North Korea from the use of ballistic missile technology.\"", "description": "This time it was possibly a submarine-launched ballistic missile and it traversed a distance of 280 miles before falling into the Sea of Japan.", "authors": ["Zeegee Cecilio", "Susan B.", "Ramon Sanchez", "Read More On The Same Topic Prabir Ghose", "Grizzly Bears In Canada Fall Victims To Climate Change", "Justin Bieber", "Hailey Baldwin Marry A Second Time In A Religious Ceremony", "Thieves Steal A Gold Toilet Valued At", "Blenheim Palace In Oxfordshire"], "top_image": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2019/10/2/os/b_1200x630/kim-jong-un-oversaw-short-range-projectiles-launch-kcna-image-sourcearirang-news-youtube-video_2333137.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
