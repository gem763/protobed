The team are getting worse, they are noticeably poorer than two years ago,\u2019 Cascarino said in his column for the Times.\n\n\u2018Jan Vertonghen, Danny Rose, Toby Alderweireld, Dele Alli \u2013 none of them are at the levels they were.\n\n\u2018Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s record entitles him to a fair crack at turning things around but I am sceptical as to whether he can. If they lose to Watford in their next game after the international break, he is finished.\n\n\u2018He is under pressure and making poor decisions. Eric Dier clearly was not fit to play on Saturday and Moussa Sissoko was out of position at right-back.\u2019\n\nSpeaking after Saturday\u2019s loss, Pochettino insisted that he is unconcerned about the prospect of losing his job, saying: \u2018No I am not worried, what worries me is life, not football.\n\n\u2018Football is a game that sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. The problem for us \u2013 it was win, win, win and it was praise for everyone.\n\nTony Cascarino thinks that Pochettino could be sacked if Spurs lose to Watford (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018Now in the last two games it was a tough situation to accept. But I don\u2019t want to be a philosopher or talk in a way that is not good.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpurs are next in action against Watford on October 19 before they face Red Star Belgrade in the Champions League and then Liverpool at Anfield the following weekend.", "description": "Mauricio Pochettino will receive his marching orders at Tottenham if he is unable to inspire his side to victory against struggling Watford after the international break, according to Tony Cascarino....", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_88517484_1570443311.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
