At present, its shares are down 8.97 per cent or 34.70p to 352.30p.\n\nDavid Madden, an analyst at CMC Markets, said: 'Should the consumer climate continue to be fragile, more people might start to use the money-saving website as a way of trimming their outgoings.'\n\nBroker Liberum said that the group's weaker performance in money and insurance should be attributed to 'subdued market conditions as opposed to Moneysupermarket's competitive position within price comparison', adding that Moneysupermarket's new strategy is a 'fundamental game changer', using first party data to push personalised deals to consumers.", "description": "The group's money division, which spans everything from credit cards to travel money, shrank 5 per cent to \u00a320.6million in the three months to the end of September.", "authors": ["Jane Denton For Thisismoney", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
