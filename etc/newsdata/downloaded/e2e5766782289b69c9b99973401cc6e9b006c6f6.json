The British street artist\u2019s previous auction record was set when his painting Keep It Spotless realized US$1.87 million at a Sotheby\u2019s auction in New York in 2008.\n\n\u201cRecord price for a Banksy painting set at auction tonight. Shame I didn't still own it,\u201d the artist, who remains largely anonymous, posted on his Instagram after the sale. The painting was acquired by its past owner\u2014whose identity is unknown\u2014in 2011 and accompanied by a certificate from Pest Control, Banksy\u2019s official studio.\n\nIn his post, Banksy also quoted art critic Robert Hughes, who said, \u201cSuppose that every worthwhile book in the world cost $1 million\u2014imagine what a catastrophic effect on culture that would have.\u201d\n\nBanksy is widely seen as a modern day Voltaire, the French writer and philosopher, who confronted burning societal issues with caustic wit and biting satire, says Alex Branczik, head of contemporary art at Sotheby\u2019s Europe.\n\n\u201c His visual irony distills society\u2019s most complicated political situations into just one, deceptively simple image that is readily shareable in our social media age. \u201d \u2014Alex Branczik\n\n\u201cBanksy is certainly one of the greatest polemicists of our time, and he sits firmly in the venerable history of political parody,\u201d Mr. Branczik says. \u201cHis visual irony distills society\u2019s most complicated political situations into just one, deceptively simple image that is readily shareable in our social media age.\u201d\n\nThe monumental canvas, created by Banksy in 2009 and titled Question Time, depicts the House of Commons in a scene filled with mad chimpanzees instead of debating Members of Parliament (MPs).\n\nThe painting was first exhibited in the groundbreaking \u201cBanksy versus Bristol Museum\u201d exhibition in 2009, and again at the museum this year before March 29, the date originally intended to mark Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union.\n\nThe painting was reworked by Banksy before this year\u2019s reappearance at the Bristol Museum. For instance, the lamps were snuffed-out and one of the previously upturned bananas now faces downward, in addition to other subtle adjustments, Sotheby\u2019s said.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear exactly when the painting was reworked. It was more recently retitled Devolved Parliament, according to Sotheby\u2019s.\n\nOffered as lot 28 at Sotheby\u2019s evening sale of contemporary art, the painting opened for bid at \u00a31.1 million and then sparked a 13-minute bidding battle.\n\nAfter the bidding reached \u00a37.1 million, it became a two-way battle between two bidders on the phone. After an incremental bid of \u00a3100,000, the hammer price was pushed to \u00a38.3 million, and one bidder on the phone called it quits.\n\nImmediately after the auctioneer gave fair warning of hammering down, a person in the room jumped in with an \u00a38.4 million offer. In a twist, the bidder who had previously dropped out came back with a winning bid of \u00a38.5 million.\n\nBoth the final record-breaking price and drama made viewers gasp, although no Banksy stunt was performed this time. Exactly a year ago, Banksy\u2019s painting Girl With Balloon began self-shredding in the middle of a live auction at Sotheby\u2019s. The resulting piece, titled Love Is in the Bin (2018), sold for \u00a31.04 million.\n\nJean-Michel Basquiat's 1984 Pyro sold for \u00a39.9 million. Courtesy of Sotheby's\n\nAlongside the Banksy, Jean-Michel Basquiat\u2019s 1984 canvas Pyro also achieved \u00a39.9 million last night, while his 1983 Natives Carrying Things achieved \u00a33.3 million.\n\nThe 39-lot sale realized a total of \u00a355 million, with an 87% sell-through rate.", "description": "The large canvas fetched \u00a39.9 million at Sotheby\u2019s contemporary art sale in London", "authors": ["Fang Block", "Alex Branczik"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-113981/social", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
