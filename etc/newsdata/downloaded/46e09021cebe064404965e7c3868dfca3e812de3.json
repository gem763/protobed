REUTERS/David Mercado\n\nMorales, already Latin America\u2019s longest-serving president, is the lone survivor of a group of fiery leftist leaders who took office in the previous decade, most of whom have since been replaced by right-leaning governments.\n\nHe has overseen a rare period of economic and political stability in South America\u2019s poorest country. But charges of vote-rigging lodged by the opposition and doubts about the legitimacy of the vote raised by official observers threaten to dog his 2020-2025 term and tarnish his reputation as a democrat.\n\nIn a speech at a military event, Morales invited countries in the region that have called for him to hold a run-off vote - the United States, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia - to take part in an audit of the official tally.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s do an audit vote by vote,\u201d Morales said in the coca-growing region of Cochabamba. \u201cI\u2019ll join (the audit). If there\u2019s fraud, the next day we\u2019ll convene a second-round\u201d election, he added in comments broadcast on state TV.\n\nShortly after Morales spoke, his chief rival in the race Carlos Mesa, a former president, announced his supporters were forming a commission to pressure the international community to not recognise the election\u2019s results.\n\nBrazil, landlocked Bolivia\u2019s biggest trade partner, has already said it would reject Morales\u2019s win until the regional group Organisation of American States (OAS) finishes an audit of the vote count that has not yet started.\n\nThe European Union and Washington-based OAS, both of whom sent observer missions to Bolivia, have also pushed Morales to convene a second-round vote to calm unrest and restore credibility to the election.\n\nProtesters blocked roads in parts of the highland capital of La Paz on Saturday, chanting \u201cfraud\u201d and waving Bolivia\u2019s red-yellow-and-red flag as anti-government strikes continued in different cities in the South American country.\n\n\u2018SCANDALOUS FRAUD\u2019\n\nThe country\u2019s embattled electoral board, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) and Morales\u2019 government have both denied any foul play and invited the OAS to audit the official tally. But they have not said whether they would accept the OAS\u2019 condition for the audit\u2019s conclusions to be legally-binding.\n\nPeru said on Saturday that it would take part in the audit at Bolivia\u2019s request, but it called for the process to be carried out respecting Bolivian laws.\n\nThe vote count by the TSE at 100% on Friday showed Morales had 47.08% of votes versus Mesa\u2019s 36.51% in a crowded race of nine candidates. That gave him the 10-point lead needed to face Mesa in a Dec. 15 second-round vote, when the opposition would likely rally behind Mesa to defeat Morales.\n\nThe TSE sparked an uproar after the election on Sunday when it halted publication of a quick vote count that showed Morales headed to a second-round with Mesa. When the quick count resumed after an outcry, it confirmed Morales\u2019 prediction on Sunday that he would pull off an outright win with the help of rural votes.\n\nMesa\u2019s campaign has also said that it has found 100,000 votes that should have been annulled due to irregularities but instead swung in Morales\u2019 favour.\n\n\u201cThis is a scandalous fraud never seen before. That\u2019s why the people are reacting,\u201d retiree Fredy Salinas, 67, said as he bought vegetables in a market in La Paz. \u201cThe people in the government are really shameless.\u201d\n\nMorales said his detractors were \u201cenvious\u201d of his achievements and accused the opposition, without providing evidence, of trying to stir up unrest to try to unseat him illegally. \u201cWith lies and tricks they\u2019re trying to instigate hatred and racism,\u201d he said.", "description": "Bolivian President Evo Morales on Saturday vowed to hold a run-off election if an audit of a vote count that gave him an outright win turns up evidence of fraud, as he sought to calm a sixth day of protests and international criticism over his disputed re-election to a fourth term.", "authors": ["Vivian Sequera", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191026&t=2&i=1445256683&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9P0KZ", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
