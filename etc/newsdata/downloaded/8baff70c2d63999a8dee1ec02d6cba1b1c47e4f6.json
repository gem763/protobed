The DUP has threatened to unite with Labour to back a customs union this week, as it warned it will fight to bring down Boris Johnson's Brexit deal. In a move that could torpedo the Prime Minister's strategy for delivering Brexit by October 31, senior DUP figures have threatened to back proposals that could prevent the UK from pursuing its own trade policy. Mr Johnson will today launch a renewed attempt to push his Brexit deal through Parliament. He will demand MPs are allowed a straightforward vote on his deal that had been expected to take place in a historic weekend sitting of Parliament. But, as Deputy Political Editor Anna Mikhailovareports, Commons Speaker John Bercow may bar the knife-edge vote. And we explain the new Brexit deal in simple language - plus what it means for you.\n\nHe has been described as the \"cleverest stupid person in Westminster\". But it has emerged that Sir Oliver Letwin, the former Conservative minister credited with the dubious honour of derailing Brexit at the 11th hour on Saturday, is in cahoots with a leading anti-Brexit barrister. Victoria Ward explains how the brains behind Letwin's \"act of sabotage\" is in fact Lord Pannick - the cross-bench peer who masterminded Mr Johnson's Supreme Court humiliation.", "description": "If you want to receive twice-daily briefings like this by email, sign up to the Front Page newsletter here and try our Audio Briefings on WhatsApp.", "authors": ["Danny Boyle", "Tim Stanley", "Jane Shilling", "Camilla Tominey", "Liz Truss", "Nick Timothy"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/20/115blower21-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqjYeQRtCUmaNTl9ge3SkvXvsQtCHq939w7zx1f6lxc4.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
