They've also moved up to an average of 36% in the BBC poll tracker.\n\nIn the meantime, the Liberal Democrats have fallen away a little from their party conference highpoint to settle at that 18%-ish level they've occupied for much of the autumn while the Brexit Party continue to drift downwards.\n\nLabour's average rating has essentially stayed flat.\n\nScotland\n\nBecause voting intention polls are fairly scarce in Scotland, it's difficult to identify trends. But the latest Panelbase poll conducted earlier this month suggests that the SNP continues to dominate.\n\nComparing polls to the 2017 general election result suggests Labour and the Conservatives are on course to lose votes, the SNP are roughly level with where they were, whilst the Lib Dems could gain votes.\n\nThe SNP's share in polls has floated between 36% and 43% for the last two years.\n\nIn our GB-wide poll tracker, that translates to 4%, occasionally dropping to 3% or rising to 5% since Scotland has just under 10% of the GB population.\n\nThat's why we don't suggest a margin of error range as we do for parties that field candidates across the whole of Great Britain.\n\nWales\n\nPolls are even rarer in Wales - but the latest from YouGov, also conducted earlier this month, broadly matches others from earlier in the year.\n\nThe Conservatives are down from their 2017 election share but Labour has fallen back much more dramatically. From the 49% they achieved then, their share of the vote has approximately halved according to polls.\n\nThe Lib Dems are up sharply and the Brexit Party are performing far more strongly than UKIP did when voters last had their say.\n\nOut of 100 people who are likely to vote, about... 36 say they will vote CON , But it could be between 32-40\n\n24 say they will vote LAB , But it could be between 20-28\n\n17 say they will vote LD , But it could be between 13-21\n\n11 say they will vote BRX , But it could be between 7-15\n\n4 say they will vote GRN , But it could be between 0-8\n\n4 say they will vote SNP\n\n0 say they will vote UKIP , But it could be between 0-4\n\n0 say they will vote PC\n\n0 say they will vote TIGfC , But it could be between 0-4 Please upgrade your browser or enable JavaScript to see the full interactive experience Of 100 Please select a demographic group for its voting intention data who are likely to vote, about...

4 October 2019\n\nLast week was undoubtedly another dramatic one in British politics.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled that the prime minister had acted unlawfully by suspending Parliament for five weeks. And the House of Commons was the scene of some the most ill-tempered debates anyone can remember.\n\nOn top of that, Labour's party conference saw rows about the future of deputy leader Tom Watson and Brexit policy.\n\nAnd Boris Johnson found himself facing allegations that he had acted improperly during his time as Mayor of London by giving favourable treatment to his 'close friend' Jennifer Arcuri.\n\nHowever, there's very little sign that any of this has had much impact on voting intention polls.\n\nThere is perhaps a little more evidence that the Conservatives have fallen back a bit from their high point a few weeks ago, but it's only a small movement.\n\nOne ComRes poll put them neck-and-neck with Labour on 27% - the first time they've not had a lead since Mr Johnson became prime minister.\n\nBut that poll's results included people who are very unlikely to vote on an equal footing with those who will vote.\n\nIt's an interesting result but doesn't feature in our poll tracker.\n\nWe use analyses that down-weight answers from those who are unlikely to vote and those figures aren't available from that poll.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats have ticked up one point to 20 in our averages, and there's been another YouGov poll which puts them in second place.\n\nLeader ratings\n\nMore noteworthy have been polls asking people to rate the party leaders.\n\nIpsos Mori's leader satisfaction ratings go back to 1977. Their September poll has Jeremy Corbyn on the lowest net score of any opposition leader since their series began.\n\n16% of people say they're satisfied with the way he's doing his job compared with 76% who say they're dissatisfied - a net score of -60.\n\nAll the pollsters who regularly ask this sort of question have Boris Johnson outperforming Mr Corbyn in terms of satisfaction, favourability or approval. His net score with Ipsos Mori is -18.\n\nHowever, looking at attitudes about Mr Johnson more widely, and in historical context, they're not terribly encouraging.\n\nCompared to previous leaders, his score is low for a prime minister at the beginning of their time in office - far worse than Theresa May's for example. And satisfaction in the government is extremely low: just 14% are satisfied whilst 81% are dissatisfied.\n\nYouGov polls also suggest that Mr Johnson is scoring lower for competence, honesty and being a strong leader than at the beginning of September.\n\nPrevious update from Peter Barnes - 20 September 2019\n\nAs our poll tracker graph shows, after a year and a half of only gradual movement, the period since February has been pretty tumultuous - perhaps reflecting what has been going on in politics.\n\nThe creation of the new Change UK Party - since renamed The Independent Group for Change (or TIGfC in our chart) - and then The Brexit Party had a major impact.\n\nAdded to this has been a sustained increase in support for the Liberal Democrats and a clear boost for the Conservatives after Boris Johnson replaced Theresa May as prime minister in July.\n\nThat is just the picture in Britain-wide polls. In Scotland, we have less evidence to go on, but it seems as though the political drama has resulted in a rise in support for the SNP, as well as the Lib Dems, at the expense of the Conservatives and Labour.\n\nConference bounce?\n\nPolls over the last week have been good for the Liberal Democrats, even taking into account the strong year they've had. The party seems to be a few points higher now than it was at the start of the month.\n\nThey will hope that the improvement is a consequence of their new policy on Brexit - a promise to revoke Article 50 if they win a majority at the next general election.\n\nHowever, it could just be a conference bounce.\n\nIt is fairly common during party conference season for each party to see their numbers boosted immediately after their turn in the sun. Often though, this fades away within a couple of weeks and things go back to roughly where they were before.\n\nWe will have to wait and see if that happens this time.\n\nMind the gap\n\nIt is always important to treat polling figures with caution, but at the moment there is an additional reason for concern: more variation between the different polling companies than normal.\n\nThis month, there have been cases where two polls published on the same day have wildly different figures - for example, the Conservatives on 28% in one poll, but 37% in another.\n\nClearly, in an election those two different vote shares would mean dramatically different outcomes in terms of the make-up of the House of Commons. So any attempt to read off from current polls to the expected election result would be foolhardy.\n\nNobody really knows why the variation is so large. Some of it is probably down to differences between how each company analyses their raw polling data, but it's hard to see how that can be the whole story given the size of the gaps.\n\nMethodology: How was the poll tracker chart put together?\n\nWhat is a poll tracker?\n\nOur poll tracker lines show an average of results from the polls to date.\n\nEach dot in the chart above shows one poll result for a party.\n\nThere are too many individual dots to keep track of: even on one day there can be very different results for one party from different polls.\n\nSo we summarise all that information with a line that averages those results.\n\nIt bounces around less and makes it easier to tell the signal from the noise (or the trends from the blips?).\n\nWhich polls do we use?\n\nWe use polls conducted by members of the British Polling Council.\n\nAs of September 2019, that's BMG, ComRes, Deltapoll, Hanbury, ICM, Ipsos Mori, Kantar, Opinium, ORB, Panelbase, Sky Data, Survation and YouGov.\n\nMost of the polls included cover Great Britain, although some do poll the whole of the UK, but as a result we do not have separate data for parties that only stand in Northern Ireland.\n\nWe use results that exclude or downweight those who are unlikely to vote and people who do not express a preference.\n\nWe include data that are in the public domain: some polling companies will not publish all data for all parties at the same time and so we update the poll tracker as data become available.\n\nWhat is the margin of error?\n\nThe margin of error is plus or minus four percentage points.\n\nThis means that there's a 90% chance that an election held tomorrow would give national vote shares within four points of our estimates for each of the parties.\n\nAnd there's a 10% chance that it would be outside that range. We base these figures on a British Polling Council analysis of the results of the final set of polls before each of the elections from 2001 to 2017.\n\nWhat about parties that only campaign in Scotland or Wales?\n\nThe approach mentioned above doesn't quite work for parties that only run in Scotland or Wales. The electorate they are appealing to is smaller and this makes their possible vote smaller when it is projected across Great Britain or the whole of the UK.\n\nThis also means that their margin of error is smaller than that of those parties that stand across Britain and is likely to be less than + / - 1%.\n\nWe have more coverage of politics in Scotland and Wales on their national politics pages.\n\nHow do we average the polls?\n\nOur estimate of a party's support is a rolling average of polls to date. Bigger and more recent polls have more influence on our figures.\n\nWe also limit the influence of any one poll or of those polling firms who poll very frequently to prevent our results being too dependent on one source.\n\nIn a little more detail: the average is weighted by sample size. The more people polled in a particular survey, the more weight we will give it, up to a threshold of 2,000 people.\n\nOn the other hand, the older a poll is the less influence it has on the average figure we calculate. We also give less value to any polling firm that has data for more than 5,000 people in a fortnight. A typical poll may cover about 1,000 people.\n\nWhy is there a margin of error?\n\nBecause a party isn't guaranteed to get the same vote share in an election as it did in a poll the previous day.\n\nPolling a sample of the population has often been likened to tasting soup. If the soup has been well stirred then you need to have only one spoonful to get a sense of what the whole bowl is like.\n\nIn the same way, a well-conducted poll of 1,000 people can, most of the time, give us an idea of what the country as a whole is thinking.\n\nBut it's not 100% precise, so, the margin of error gives a sense of how the results might change with a different sample of 1,000 people.\n\nThis margin of error only applies to national vote share: converting that into seats in Parliament is much harder and less precise.\n\nWhy do polling companies give such different answers?\n\nThere are also systematic differences between polling companies who approach people in different ways, who ask different questions and who analyse the results differently.\n\nWe list the main polling firms and the questions they ask below. Polling companies also analyse their data differently. They make choices about how to weight each respondent.\n\nFor example, if a poll of 1,000 people is made up of 550 men and 450 women, it is unrepresentative because it does not reflect the profile of the UK population (51% female).\n\nSo the answers of female respondents should be given slightly more weight than male respondents in the analysis so that the final results are 51% based on female answers rather than 45%.\n\nThat's not controversial, but adjusting for past vote or likelihood to vote is harder. Some pollsters ask respondents who they voted for last time and weight the sample to try and ensure it matches the political make-up of the general population.\n\nOne problem with doing this is that a certain number of people will incorrectly recall who they voted for last time - and a few will even lie about it. So polling companies often use a variety of further methods to improve the accuracy of their weighting.\n\nThat variety of methods leads to a variety of answers. Most companies then weight or filter by likelihood to vote so that the answers of people who are most likely to vote are given the most prominence in the results.\n\nFinally, several pollsters reallocate a percentage of \"don't knows\" to the party they voted for last time. This is to get around the problem that emerged following the 1979 election with the phenomenon of \"shy Tories\" or the \"spiral of silence\" - people who do not want to discuss their voting preference but who will still vote.\n\nOur approach, excluding \"don't knows\" from our polltracker, is slightly different.\n\nIt is like saying that they won't vote or, if they did, their voting preferences would look quite like those who do express a preference.\n\nQuestions asked by each pollster:\n\nBMG\n\nIf a general election were held today, which of the following parties would you vote for?\n\nConservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat, SNP (if living in Scotland), Plaid Cymru (if living in Wales), Green Party, Brexit Party, another party\n\nPrior to August 2019, Green Party and Brexit Party were only prompted for if the respondent answered \"another party\". Following a randomised controlled trial, BMG decided to move those two parties into the main prompt list. The Independent Group for Change and UKIP remain in the secondary prompt list.\n\nComRes\n\nIf there were a (UK) general election tomorrow to elect MPs to Westminster, would you vote Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat, Brexit Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru, or for another party?\n\nDeltapoll\n\nIf there were a general election held tomorrow, which party would you vote for?
