If you don't, you can sign up.\n\nThe app is available on both Android and iOS.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe licence doesn't look that much different from a regular plastic licence,\n\nIt contains your photo, name, address, licence number, driving conditions and licence expiration date.\n\nThe major difference is the addition of a QR code that can be scanned for validity, including at some registered clubs. It will apparently only share your info to the scanner for a limited time.\n\nCan I show it when pulled over?\n\nImage: Supplied\n\nIt's still illegal to touch your phone while behind the wheel, even when stationary, so don't take the risk.\n\nIf you get pulled over and anticipate having to show your digital licence do not touch your phone until an officer asks you to.\n\nServices NSW agrees. \"If you get pulled over by the police, do not pick up your phone until the officer requests to see your driver licence. Significant penalties apply for using a mobile phone illegally.\"\n\nWhere will it work?\n\nWhile most establishments, including pubs and clubs, should accept it, Services NSW has warned that some places may not consider it valid.\n\n\"Always carry your plastic card if you know you're going to need your driver licence, or if you plan to travel interstate. Ensure your phone screen is not cracked and your phone is charged,\" says the Service NSW website.\n\nWill it work offline?\n\nYes, as long as you're logged into the app. You'll still be required to use your login PIN.\n\nWhat else will the app show me?\n\nIn relation to motoring, you can also use the Service NSW app to check your rego, fines and demerit points.\n\nYou can find out more from the Service NSW website.", "description": "New South Wales has just become one of the first places in the world to launch digital driver's licences.
