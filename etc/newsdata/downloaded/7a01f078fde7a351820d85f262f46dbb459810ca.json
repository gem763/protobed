Meanwhile, the share of millennials who say they are \"extremely likely\" to vote for a candidate who identifies as a socialist doubled.\n\nNearly half of Gen Z and millennial respondents said they felt the U.S. economy worked against them \u2014 markedly more than other generations. They've grown up in a capitalist country where economic inequality has continued to climb.\n\nMany are burdened with college debt, have seen little wage growth and face the threat of job loss due to automation \u2014 all while the top 1% continue to accumulate wealth.\n\nSocialism and communism also don't bring the same negative associations and memories that they have for older generations. Even the oldest millennials were just children when the Berlin Wall fell.\n\nBy the numbers: 19% of millennials and 12% of Gen Z said they thought the Communist Manifesto \"better guarantees freedom and equality for all\" than the Declaration of Independence. That's compared to just 2% of baby boomers and 5% of Gen X.\n\nJust 7% of boomers said they had at least a \"somewhat favorable\" view of communism \u2014 compared to more than a third of millennials and more than a quarter of Gen Z.\n\nThe bottom line: Young people's political views often change as they grow older, but their support for socialist ideas and leaders is a sign that the old rules of politics are changing fast.", "description": "And half say they have an unfavorable view of capitalism.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/msZXKT09d-QKu8CeizNNUrMAVB8=/0x0:2400x1350/1920x1080/2019/10/28/1572223319287.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
