The investment bank initiated coverage on Afterpay with a 'sell' rating and prediction the share price will halve in a year.\n\nUBS said it could attract regulatory scrutiny because \u2013 by shifting the cost of financing from consumers to merchants \u2013- it \"arguably creates a distortion which could significantly influence consumers' choice of payment method\".\n\nUBS estimated Afterpay's merchant charges \u2013 a 30\u00a2 fixed transaction fee plus a commission on the sales value ranging between 3 to 7 per cent \u2013 represents an equivalent effective annualised interest rate of 19 to 49 per cent on a $150 transaction.\n\nCredit and debit card schemes are prevented by law from restraining merchants from passing on their costs, but Afterpay's business model is built around customers not paying for the service (unless they are late).\n\nThis distinguishes it from traditional interest-based lending, and also means its operations fall outside the National Consumer Credit Code. Merchants typically pay a fee to Afterpay of between 4 to 6 per cent of the cost of the goods.\n\nRetailers have accepted paying the fee, which is much higher than what they pay to take card payments, because the Afterpay platform has created incremental sales by referring new customers to them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Reserve Bank said it would commence a \"comprehensive review of the cards regulatory framework\" in early 2020 with a view to concluding it by the end of the year.\n\nAfterpay has been approached for comment on the RBA move.\n\nAlong with the \"no surcharge\" rules of buy now pay later services, it will examine the issues including the level of the interchange fee benchmarks and caps, the transparency of scheme and processing fees, competition in the debit card market, the competitive balance between card schemes.\n\nThe RBA said it intends to publish an issues paper for the review in early 2020 \"and will consult widely with stakeholders\".\n\nIt will be the first comprehensive review since 2015\u201316, which led to changes to the two interchange standards and the surcharge standard.\n\nBanks on notice too\n\nThe Payments System Board annual report also warns the banks about least-cost routing, which allows merchants to elect to send payments down cheaper Eftpos payments rails.\n\nAs more payments switch to Eftpos and away from the major card schemes, the RBA said it expected banks \"would promote this functionality to all their merchant customers\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Merchant awareness of least-cost routing is an important factor affecting the degree of downward pressure on payment costs in the economy that can be realised from least-cost routing,\" the RBA said.\n\nIt added \"the benefits to competition from least-cost routing should not be prevented by issuers removing networks from dual-network cards\".\n\nThe RBA also said it did not want tokenisation, which is being used to improve payments security by hiding card numbers, to reduce competition in the payments system.\n\nIt says it \"would be concerned if scheme rules or policies on tokenisation limited the ability of merchants to choose to route card-not-present transactions through their preferred network\".", "description": "The Reserve Bank will investigate whether \"policy action\" is required to target buy now, pay later operators who prevent merchants from passing the costs of the payments service to customers - something not available to the credit card schemes.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/483fbb8a2f9c96303aea7cc03908455caf6bc67f", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
