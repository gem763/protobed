despite their defeat in Yokohama.\n\nNamibia, the only other African side to qualify for the tournament, provided little resistance in Toyota as they were carved up time and again.\n\nNine tries were scored as Erasmus's men took out the frustrations of defeat by the All Blacks on their opponents.\n\nMakazole Mapimpi touches down for South Africa as they steamrollered Namibia in Toyota\n\nLukhanyo Am strolls over as Rassie Erasmus's side secure their first win of the tournament\n\nSouth Africa 49-3 Italy\n\nPool B, 4 October, Shizuoka Stadium Ecopa, Fukuroi\n\nIn theory, this was meant to be Italy's best chance of proving they can still mix it with the best sides in the world.\n\nThey failed in that bid, and emphatically so after a second-half capitulation.\n\nItaly were supposed to provide the stiffest opposition outside New Zealand, but were poor\n\nThe first-half had been respectable at least, South Africa returning to the changing rooms just the 14 points ahead.\n\nBut a red card for loose-head Andrea Lovotti just four minutes into the second period ended the game as a contest, the Springboks pulling away with five more tries.\n\nCheslin Kolbe finally announced his arrival at the tournament, touching down twice.\n\nCheslin Kolbe touches down for one of his two scores against the Italians in Shizuoka\n\nSouth Africa 66-7 Canada\n\nPool B, 8 October, Kobe Misaki Stadium, Kobe\n\nSouth Africa saved their most brutal display for their final group game, running in 10 tries past a hapless Canadian defence in Kobe.\n\nThat included the quickest hat-trick in World Cup history, when Cobus Reinach went over three times in just 11 minutes during the first half.\n\nIn theory, this thrashing left them with an outside chance of claiming top spot, but any fanciful notions of an Italy upset against New Zealand were ended when the match was cancelled due to Super-Typhoon Hagibis.\n\nThat set the Springboks on a collision course with hosts Japan in the last eight.\n\nCobus Reinach grabbed the quickest hat-trick in World Cup history against Canada in Kobe\n\nSouth Africa 26-3 Japan\n\nQuarter-final, 20 October, Tokyo Stadium, Tokyo\n\nThis was the day, as Sportsmail's Martin Samuel put it, that the Springboks killed Bambi.\n\nIt was also the day that they once more became serious challengers for the Webb Ellis trophy.\n\nThere had been no real challenge put in front of the green jerseys since their opening weekend defeat by New Zealand, and here was arguably their biggest.\n\nMapimpi touches down against Japan, as South Africa ensure there'd be no repeat of 2015\n\nJapan had captured the hearts and minds of the rugby world with their dazzling displays in Pool A - beating the world No 1 ranked side Ireland before putting in a memorable display against Scotland to book their place in the quarter-finals for the first time.\n\nAnd here they had a chance to repeat their incredible feat of four years previous and beat the Springboks on the biggest stage of them all, in front of their own fans.\n\nWhen hype died down and the game kicked off, South Africa didn't give them a sniff.\n\nJapanese players fall to their haunches after a physical Springboks side got the better of them\n\nThey stifled the life out of a side that had wowed with their free-flowing, mesmeric attacking style, delivering shuddering hit after shuddering hit to stop the hosts in their path.\n\nAfter scoring in the fourth minute through Makazole Mapimpi, they didn't relent and pulled away in the second half as they wore down those red and white stripes.\n\nThey had killed the fairytale story of the tournament, and they did not care one jot.\n\nWille Le Roux embraces Japan winger Kotaro Matsushima at full-time following the victory\n\nSouth Africa 19-16 Wales\n\nSemi-final, 27 October, International Stadium, Yokohama\n\nSouth Africa and Wales entered their semi-final both knowing what awaited the winner in the final, after England's dominant display against the All Blacks.\n\nBoth sides gave their all to join them in what was a bruising, physical encounter - one that was difficult to watch at times for anyone but the purists.\n\nTime and again the Springboks tried to build a lead through the boot of Pollard. Time and again they were pegged back as Dan Biggar responded.\n\nEven when they did finally breach the Welsh whitewash through Damian De Allende, Warreng Gatland's men responded with a try of their own through Josh Adams.\n\nDespite their sizeable injury list, Wales couldn't be shaken off.\n\nDamian De Allende scored the opening try of a tight semi-final in Yokohama against Wales\n\nThe difference, in the end, was just three points, as Pollard kicked the winning penalty with just four minutes left on the clock.\n\nA week will seem barely enough time to recover from such a full-blooded encounter.\n\nThe hope will be that England expended just as much energy putting in their era-defining performance the day before.\n\nBoth sides need to find one more to lift that trophy on Saturday.", "description": "South Africa have effectively been playing knockout rugby ever since their defeat by New Zealand in their opener.
