But he has said he will fight on.\n\nIn an article written for Time from prison in June, he wrote: \"My lack of freedom today is a price I knew I would have to pay for the city I love.\"\n\nHe stepped back into the fray shortly after when authorities released him just one month into his prison term, immediately calling for Hong Kong's pro-Beijing leader Carrie Lam to step down over her role pushing for the controversial extradition proposal that sparked the current wave of protests.\n\nAuthorities did not confirm whether the decision was procedural or a gesture to protestors.\n\nAfter the bill was eventually scrapped in early September, Wong vowed to fight on, deeming its withdrawal \"Too little, too late\".\n\n\"Our determination and courage to fight for freedom will still continue,\" he said. \"Hong Kongers deserve universal suffrage. We deserve to elect our own government.\"", "description": "Joshua Wong, the Hong Kong activist soon to visit the United States, was the unlikely hero of the Umbrella Movement that inspired hundreds of thousands to take over Hong Kong's streets for two months in 2014 calling for free elections.
