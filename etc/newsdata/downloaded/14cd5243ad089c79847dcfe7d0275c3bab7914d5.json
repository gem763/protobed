That's because banks makes you liable for any fraudulent charges on your account if you share your banking access information.\n\n'Never tell anyone your password'\n\nEven National Bank warns its customers not to divulge their banking info.\n\n\"Never tell anyone your password,\" says a post on its website. \"This rule applies even to members of your family and anyone claiming to be a National Bank employee. Remember, your password is like the key to your house. You must take all the necessary precautions to prevent it from falling into someone else's hands.\"\n\nHowever, National Bank makes no apologies for requesting the information, saying it \"is scrubbed 100 per cent\" and called the requirement an \"innovative\" way for customers to create an online account without having to visit a bricks-and-mortar bank.\n\nFormer Ontario privacy commissioner Ann Cavoukian says National Bank's request for customer login information for another bank is 'unprecedented.' (Onnig Cavoukian)\n\n\"I've never been confronted with that before in all my 20 years of online banking,\" Kaminsky said.\n\nNeither banks Simplii nor Tangerine \u2014 which are online only and don't have traditional brick-and-mortar banks \u2014 require customers opening an account to provide access to an account at another bank.\n\nKaminsky erred on the side of caution, logged off and didn't go ahead with opening an account with National Bank.\n\nHe emailed the bank asking if they were really serious about the requested information and how they would feel about one of their clients giving access to a National Bank account. He said he hasn't received a response.\n\n'Unprecedented' request, says privacy expert\n\nPrivacy experts see it differently.\n\n\"I've never heard of such a thing. It's unprecedented and completely privacy invasive that they would ask for your PIN number, which only you should have. That's not something you share with a bank,\" said Ann Cavoukian, former information and privacy commissioner of Ontario.\n\nShe said the request reflects no understanding of the sensitivity of the information.\n\nSharon Polsky, president of the Privacy and Access Council of Canada, says people who give their banking info to others may be liable if they're victims of fraud. (Submitted by Sharon Polsky)\n\n\"Everybody's been hacked these days and data breaches abound, so why would you reveal this information if you don't have to?\" Cavoukian asked.\n\nSharon Polsky, president of the Privacy and Access Council of Canada, called the request \"startling\" and said there are other ways of verifying a person's identity that are less invasive and risky, such as credit bureau checks.\n\n\"I'd suggest that National Bank is being a bit heavy-headed and they might want to revisit what information they are collecting,\" Polsky said.\n\nNational Bank cited regulations from the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) as the basis for asking for access to a potential customer's existing account.\n\nThe head office of the National Bank of Canada is seen in Montreal on April 21, 2017. (Ryan Remiorz/Canadian Press)\n\nFINTRAC is the government body established to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorist organizations. Its regulations set the rules for the information required by banks when customers open an account.\n\nIn an email to CBC News, FINTRAC spokesperson Ren\u00e9e Bercier said one way for a bank to confirm a customer's identity is to refer to information that includes a person's name and confirms they have an account with a financial entity.\n\nHowever, she said and noted in boldface type that \"Nothing in the Act or Regulations requires a business to collect the login details of any person or entity.\"\n\nBercier said in cases where this happens, \"the business offering the service typically does not not have access to the information that is entered,\" although she said FINTRAC can't speak to National Bank's practises.\n\nNational Bank stands behind its approach\n\nNational Bank's senior manager of everyday banking solutions, Mariana Elizalde, said National Bank's processes are secure.\n\n\"We have many people that have gone through the process and opened an account online,\" she said, adding if someone is uncomfortable in providing access to their bank account, they can go to a National Bank branch instead.\n\nAs for requiring access to another bank account, Elizalde said that information isn't kept by National Bank.\n\n\"It is scrubbed 100 per cent,\" she said.\n\nHowever, that doesn't satisfy Cavoukian, the former Ontario privacy commissioner. She'd like to know how the information is scrubbed and whether it's retrievable.\n\n\"I have no idea what would happen in this instance, but [them] just expecting me to trust them? No,\" said Cavoukian.\n\n'Ask questions,' says privacy body\n\nThe Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada declined comment, saying it hasn't examined the specifics of this case.\n\n\"Our general advice to individuals who are uncomfortable with a request for information is to ask questions,\" spokesperson Vito Pilieco wrote in an email.\n\nHe said if people are not satisfied with the response and believe there has been a violation of federal privacy laws, they have a right to file a complaint with the federal privacy commissioner.\n\nThe Canadian Bankers Association (CBA) \u2014 of which National Bank is a member \u2014 cautions people on its website against disclosing their banking information.\n\n\"Although your bank may contact you by text, email and phone they will never ask you to disclose personal information such as your credit card number, PIN or online banking password as they already have that information,\" it said.\n\n\"If you are unsure about any communication you receive, contact your bank using a phone number or email address that you know is legitimate.\"\n\nBankers association: 'acceptable'\n\nCBA spokesperson Mathieu Labr\u00e8che said that comment is intended to educate people on how to avoid phishing, scams and other illegitimate acts, such as those that have not been initiated by a customer.\n\n\"Sharing sign-in access with another Canadian financial institution for a legitimate purpose, such as opening an account online, is acceptable,\" Labr\u00e8che said.\n\nThe Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, which collects information on internet fraud and identification theft complaints, doesn't recommend people share their login details with anyone.\n\n\"Not to mention, I don't think banks will even ask their customers for this information,\" spokesperson Jeff Thomson said in an email.\n\nPolsky urges people to protect their private information.\n\n\"It's important for people to become better aware of their rights and responsibilities and to question things, not to meekly give up information because they were asked,\" Polsky said, adding if people are uncomfortable with a request, they should ask what other information can be provided instead.\n\nMORE TOP STORIES:", "description": "Privacy experts are dumbfounded by the National Bank of Canada's policy of asking potential customers who want to open a new online account remotely to give them their account number and PIN for an account at another bank.", "authors": ["Consumer Watchdog", "Yvonne Colbert Has Been A Journalist For Nearly Years", "Covering Everything Human Interest Stories To The Provincial Legislature.
