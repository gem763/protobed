A multilingual show whose installments are standalone interrogation-room dramas, it contends that every crime can be solved via careful questioning, attentiveness to body language, and a raft of evidence and clues\u2014as well as 45 minutes\u2019 worth of persistence.\n\nFor all its conceptual gimmickry, that makes Criminal (premiering Sept. 20) akin to a typical network procedural in which cases are closed by the time the credits roll. Ambiguity, much less failure, isn\u2019t really part of its package. That, alas, proves a mounting problem the more one proceeds through its dozen chapters. Refusing to deviate from its formula except in minor ways, it\u2019s a cat-and-mouse game that never lets the latter escape the clutches of the former\u2014a situation that, in the final tally, results in monotony, and winds up squandering a host of great individual performances from David Tennant, Haley Atwell, J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Renier and the incomparable Nina Hoss.\n\nNo matter which iteration of Criminal you\u2019re watching, all the action is set in the same spaces: a police interview suite with a one-way mirror; the control room behind that viewing glass; and a hallway and lobby whose windows gaze out onto a hazy city. This one-locale-fits-all approach affords uniformity for its sagas; it also, however, drains them of their cultural distinctiveness. It\u2019s difficult to feel like there\u2019s anything radically different about the show\u2019s international detectives when they all, strangely, share the same physical workspace. And that impression is only exacerbated by the fact that there\u2019s nothing uniquely French, German, Spanish or British about the characters\u2019 storylines or personal dilemmas. As envisioned by showrunners Jim Field Smith and George Kay (who also direct and write the U.K. episodes), Criminal provides superficial diversity for narratives that largely could have taken place anywhere.\n\nAdmittedly, a couple of episodes\u2014including one involving a Frenchwoman who may have committed fraud by pretending to be at the 2015 Bataclan nightclub attack\u2014are tailored to their country of origin. Yet most aren\u2019t, and neither are the protagonists, who primarily sit across a big table from suspects accused of infractions ranging from domestic abuse and migrant smuggling to murder. There are four to five police officers to each of the series\u2019 casts, some reckless (Spain\u2019s Emma Su\u00e1rez, Germany\u2019s Sylvester Groth), a few cautious (Britain\u2019s Lee Ingleby, Spain\u2019s \u00c1lvaro Cervantes), and others self-interested (France\u2019s Laurent Lucas, Spain\u2019s Mar\u00eda Morales). The issue is, you could mix and match them and most of the actual tales wouldn\u2019t change one iota; to Criminal\u2019s detriment, there\u2019s never a sense that specific nationalities might employ idiosyncratic tactics to persuade people to admit wrongdoing.\n\nThis is a shortcoming of the series rather than its performers, who do the best they can with characters that are fleshed out via peripheral tidbits. With so much time spent on the interrogations themselves, however, these paltry morsels underline just how little we know about them, save for one or two clich\u00e9d traits. The show is only on solid footing when it\u2019s letting its investigators dive into the cases at hand, whether it\u2019s a tough French construction company bigwig who stands accused of killing a worker, a playful Spanish woman who may have lured a lover to his death, or a reticent Turkish man whose German wife is in critical condition after a tumble down their home\u2019s stairs.\n\nIn virtually all of its self-contained plots, Criminal derives intrigue and suspense from the tension between what individuals outwardly project, and what they conceal. That internal/external dynamic extends to the detectives as well, and speaks to the material\u2019s underlying idea that everyone involved is engaged in some form of performance\u2014for each other, and for the myriad cameras recording the interrogations (not to mention for us, the viewer). Unfortunately, that potentially rich thematic thread isn\u2019t amplified in any way by the show\u2019s visual scheme, courtesy of directors Oliver Hirschbiegel (Germany), Frederic Mermoud (France), Mariano Barroso (Spain), and Smith (U.K.). Save for a few of Smith\u2019s contributions, the 12-episode affair is, aesthetically speaking, proficient but bland. Mindhunter this is not.\n\nThe same doesn\u2019t hold, thankfully, for the standout turns from its biggest stars. As a father alleged to have offed his stepdaughter during a trip to one of her netball tournaments, and whose sole response to cross-examination is \u201cNo comment,\u201d Tennant has a steely resolve that\u2019s downright eerie. Atwell, on the other hand, is a rivetingly brash, nervous mess as a blue nail polish-decorated Londoner thought to have poisoned her sister\u2019s boyfriend. And no one in Criminal is as great as Hoss (frequent leading lady for Christian Petzold), who\u2019s unnerving as one half of a serial killer duo now attempting, after 20 years in prison for a string of homicides, to negotiate for intel on the daughter she\u2019s never met. Her eyes alight with feral caginess, Hoss\u2019 performance is a triumph of layered, manipulative emotions, and alone almost justifies the series\u2019 existence.\n\nCriminal only rarely rises to such heights, given how often its dragged down by its desire to have \u201cgood guys\u201d invariably compel possible \u201cbad guys\u201d to confess to whatever it is they\u2019re hiding\u2014sometimes in ways that so contradict their own intentions and welfare, it feels as if narrative dictates are trumping basic logic. The various teams\u2019 success at deducing, in the span of a single episode, what really happened, and who really did what, renders the scenarios themselves almost beside the point; one way or another, revelatory declarations are guaranteed. That\u2019s not to say that each suspect is, in the end, guilty. But it does mean that Smith and Kay\u2019s series can\u2019t fathom an outcome in which direct questioning\u2014be it of a sensitive, devious, or blunt nature\u2014doesn\u2019t ultimately extract the truth. It\u2019s a comforting idea, but one that in light of so many other, more nuanced fiction and non-fiction crime dramas, makes it feel na\u00efve.", "description": "The ambitious 12-episode, four country-spanning crime series\u2014now streaming\u2014is an interrogation-room drama that leaves little to the imagination.", "authors": ["Nick Schager"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569019536/190919-netflix-criminal-tease_bkmn6n", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
