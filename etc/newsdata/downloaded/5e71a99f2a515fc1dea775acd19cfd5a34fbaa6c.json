Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) took the lead in a new Des Moines Register Iowa poll on Saturday night, marking the first time the Massachusetts Senator led both former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in the first caucus state in the poll.\n\nAccording to the new survey, Warren narrowly leads at 22 percent, with Biden following at 20 and Sanders at 11 percent. No other candidate reached double digits but South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg followed at 9 percent, with Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) at 6 percent to round out the top five. Additionally, the poll found that Warren was drawing the support of 32 percent of those who say that they caucused for Sanders in 2016 and that she narrowly led him among voters under age 35.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve had someone other than Joe Biden at the top of the leader board,\u201d J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co., which conducted the poll , said.\n\nThe poll comes as Sanders\u2019 campaign has shaken up its staff in two early voting states.\n\nThe Independent from Vermont remains at or near the top of most primary polls and no other candidate has matched his fundraising and grassroots organization capacity. But even with his staying power, he has been increasingly eclipsed in the eyes of opponents by Warren (D-MA) as the main progressive force in the race.\n\nStuck in this position, Sanders\u2019 campaign has shuffled staff in two early crucial primary states, where his operation replaced their New Hampshire state director and Iowa political director and a deputy Iowa field director. Some sympathetic to Sanders have noted that changing around staff at this juncture obviously demonstrates a sign of dissatisfaction with the Senator\u2019s status in the race. Though, he continues to build and demonstrate a massive legion of support, hitting one million donors this week\u2014a milestone no other candidate has reached yet.\n\nThat explains why now internally, the only message that Sanders\u2019 team would convey is confidence, with one surrogate noting that the Vermont senator\u2019s resources are so vast that his campaign will kick into an even higher gear with an anticipated television ad buy in the early states.\n\n\u201cThere are two advantages that Senator Sanders has,\u201d Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), a campaign co-chair, told The Daily Beast. \u201cHe\u2019s got the largest grassroots fundraising base. He hasn\u2019t yet gone on television in the early states. He\u2019s going to go on television in the early states. Some of the other candidates have already been on television. Once he goes on television, he\u2019s going to be able to sustain it and have more resources to do that not just in the early states but in places like California.\u201d\n\nDespite Khanna\u2019s claim about the Senator\u2019s plans, a spokesperson for the campaign quickly denied later that there would be an ad buy soon.\n\nWhether or not there will be, Sanders\u2019 campaign for now is chalking up the staffing changes to isolated incidents and natural growing pains through the course of a campaign.\n\n\u201c Pundits in the Beltway might not believe it, but Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign in Iowa is out-organizing the entire field, and this is all powered by the most grassroots volunteers and donors of any campaign in the country. \u201d \u2014 Iowa State Director Misty Rebik\n\nFor instance, there had been some annoyance with how Joe Caiazzo had been running the New Hampshire operation. That was made clear by reported cheering last weekend when members of the state steering committee heard that he had been reassigned to Massachusetts.\n\nSanders dominated in his neighboring state in the 2016 primary, which helped propel his campaign to become a major threat against Hillary Clinton. Now, he is locked in a tight contest with Biden and Warren, according to the Real Clear Politics average of recent polls.\n\nIn Iowa, the campaign parted ways with political director Jess Mazour, though in that case, there was far less apparent open negativity about the way in which she was running things.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll continue to make moves that we feel best position this campaign to win,\u201d campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement to The Washington Post about the move. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story.\n\nSanders famously fought Clinton to a near draw in the Hawkeye State in 2016, portending the strength of his campaign to come. Though famously difficult to poll, he is now basically deadlocked in second place with Warren behind Biden. Yet his campaign announced on Friday that they had surpassed one million voter contacts in the state, another sign of the strength of their ground operation that they hope pays off next year.\n\n\u201cPundits in the Beltway might not believe it, but Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign in Iowa is out-organizing the entire field, and this is all powered by the most grassroots volunteers and donors of any campaign in the country,\u201d Iowa State Director Misty Rebik said in a statement.\n\nThe purgatory status for Sanders campaign was demonstrated by an Iowa poll on Saturday night that showed him slipping. But there\u2019s no doubt that he remains among one of the top contenders for the nomination, with other campaigns even saying as much. In a memo on Saturday, Sen. Cory Booker\u2019s (D-NJ) campaign manager issued an urgent plea for fundraising in the next 10 days to effectively keep him in the race. Within it, he noted that Biden, Sanders, Warren and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg are the four campaigns with enough resources to compete for the long haul currently.\n\n\u201c Warren has completely out campaigned him. I scratch my head and go how is Bernie going to get around her? \u201d \u2014 Unaffiliated Democratic consultant\n\nWhile he still is among the top tier of candidates in the crowded field, there is some evidence to suggest that Sanders\u2019 opponents are more interested in training their fire on Warren for now. On Thursday, a number of the other presidential contenders leveled various criticisms at the Massachusetts Democrat, with Buttigieg explicitly invoking her by name to say that she was \u201cextremely evasive\u201d in answers about Medicare for All, the primary policy plank that has animated Sanders\u2019 political vision for years.\n\nWarren also won the support of the Working Families Party this week, a left-wing political outfit that supported Sanders in the last primary. The voting process, and the lack of a revealed tally, has led to some acrimony from Sanders supporters who have leveled charges that the leadership of WFP essentially commandeered the process to back Warren.\n\nMaurice Mitchell, WFP\u2019s national director and Nelini Stamp, national organizing director at WFP, wrote about the selection process in response to criticism that they had heard. In turn, they also urged that supporters remain positive about both candidates.\n\n\u201cBoth Warren and Sanders are fighting for the world we want to see, and both have brought new and vital ideas into the political debate,\u201d they wrote. \u201cOur endorsement of Senator Warren does not diminish our respect for Senator Sanders, and to be clear, we\u2019re going to be relentlessly positive about both of them in the months ahead.\u201d\n\nSanders and Warren appear poised to remain \u201crelentlessly positive\u201d about each other as well\u2014as neither side has demonstrated a willingness or desire to go negative. In fact, Khanna defended both of them against Buttigieg\u2019s attack line in a tweet on Friday.\n\nBut underscoring some of the recent moves by the campaign appears to be a notion from some that Warren is outflanking Sanders for now. And it remains to be seen whether she is having an ephemeral moment or steadily climbing her way to the nomination.\n\n\u201cWarren has completely out campaigned him,\u201d an unaffiliated Democratic consultant familiar with the campaign told The Daily Beast. \u201cI scratch my head and go how is Bernie going to get around her?\u201d", "description": "The Massachusetts Democrat has had momentum for weeks, and this marks the first time she\u2019s bumped Biden out of the lead in this poll.", "authors": ["Gideon Resnick", "Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_150/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569114393/GettyImages-1176217901_kauxmp", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
