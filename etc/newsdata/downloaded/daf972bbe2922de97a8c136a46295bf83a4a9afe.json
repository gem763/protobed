Dating from between 900 and 800BC, the objects will go on show for the first time in Havering Hoard: A Bronze Age Mystery, at the Museum Of London Docklands.\n\nThey include axe heads, spearheads, fragments of swords, daggers and knives.\n\nCurator Kate Sumnall told the PA news agency: \u2018We can tell a lot about what life was like for Bronze Age people living in this part of London. Hoarding is something we see a lot of in the late Bronze Age.\n\nThe excavation of the Havering hoard. (PA)\n\nAn axe found among the treasures (PA)\n\n\u2018We don\u2019t have all the answers. Our knowledge of the Bronze Age is quite fragmentary. But every time we find something it gives us another piece in that jigsaw puzzle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018This may have been a store, for a metal worker, or some sort of offering to the gods perhaps. We don\u2019t know.\u2019\n\n\u2018It may have been for recycling. Bronze can be melted down and recast almost an infinite number of times. There are a lot of overlaps between what we know about the Bronze Age and today.\u2019\n\nAlmost all the objects, discovered in September last year, appear to be partially broken or damaged and it is not known why they were not recovered.\n\nThe artifacts found near the River Thames are going on display at the Museum of London in the exhibition \u2018Havering Hoard\u2019 which runs from 3 April \u2013 25 October 2020. (PA)\n\nHistoric England chief executive Duncan Wilson said: \u2018This extraordinary discovery adds immensely to our understanding of Bronze Age life\u2026The opportunity to investigate here and ultimately unearth the remarkable hoards that have come to light was only possible because of the effective partnership between archaeologists and developers.\u2019\n\nRoy Stephenson, London\u2019s historic environment lead at the Museum Of London, said: \u2018We\u2019re thrilled to be able to display this momentous discovery for the first time at the Museum Of London Docklands as the centrepiece of a major exhibition in April 2020.\u2019\n\nThe museum has acquired the objects after they were declared treasure by the coroner. The hoard will travel to the Havering Museum for display after going on show at the Museum Of London Docklands.", "description": "Over 450 objects have been found near the River Thames", "authors": ["Jeff Parsons"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_90969616_1571734801.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
