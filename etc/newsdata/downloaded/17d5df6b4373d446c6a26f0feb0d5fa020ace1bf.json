They scored some incredible tries and there is no doubt that their handling skills are just on another level to everyone else.\n\nNamibia really were good in the first half but went missing in the second which was a shame.\n\n7:41AM\n\nFULL TIME! New Zealand 71 Namibia 9\n\nWow that try was something special. The gong goes as Namibia kick the ball to New Zealand who attack from deep.\n\nBarrett knocks the ball on and that is that. Fantastic second half from the All Blacks.\n\n7:39AM\n\n79 min: MISSED CON Barrett New Zealand 71 Namibia 9\n\nBarrett drags this kick to the left.\n\n7:38AM\n\n78 min: TRY! Perenara New Zealand 71 Namibia 9\n\nPerenara breaks down the left wing - some outrageous offloading puts Perenara back on the ball who almost scores an amazing try. There could have been a forward pass, a foot in touch and a questionable grounding. TMO checks it.\n\nBrad Weber throws a pass round his back which is one of the passes of the tournament. Perenara manages to get the ball down somehow. Try of the tournament!\n\n7:34AM\n\n77 min: CON Barrett 66 Namibia 9\n\nBarrett adds another - 22 points on the day for him.\n\n7:34AM\n\n76 min: TRY!

The ball is spread right but the momentum of the attack stagnates.\n\nNamibia are being slowly driven back by wave after wave of solid All Blacks defence. Barrett then steals the ball. Textbook defending.\n\nThe ball is kicked in behind and Namibia scramble to get the ball into touch.\n\n7:30AM\n\n73 min: YELLOW CARD! Tuungafasi New Zealand 59 Namibia 9\n\nPenalty to Namibia for a high tackle. The TMO is reviewing the challenge from Tuungafasi. It is high to the neck when the player is falling down. Yellow card! New Zealand's second of the match.\n\nThe ball is kicked into the corner.\n\n7:27AM\n\n71 min: New Zealand 59 Namibia 9\n\nBarrett is hammered off the kick off. The ball goes left before Frizell spills in the midfield. Namibia attack on the half-way line.\n\nNamibia makes a break and are onto the edge of the All Blacks 22. Can they get their first try of the match?\n\n7:25AM\n\n68 min: CON Barrett New Zealand 59 Namibia 9\n\nBarrett adds another tricky conversion - his goal kicking has been excellent in the second half.\n\n7:24AM\n\n68 min: TRY! Ben Smith New Zealand 57 Namibia 9\n\nIoane gets the ball at first receiver and kick-passes the ball to Bridge on the left wing. New Zealand attack down the left and Ben Smith side steps his way over the line for his second try of the match. Brilliant offload from Lienert-Brown for the assist.\n\n7:21AM\n\n65 min: New Zealand 52 Namibia 9\n\nNamibia make a break after some lovely offloading from Klim. Namibia are caught on the left wing but they retain possession. The forwards carry on New Zealand's 22 but fail to get much go forward.\n\nNamibia have gone through 13 phases before the ball is spilled in an attempted offload. New Zealand counter through Ioane who is on from the bench.\n\n7:18AM\n\n62 min: New Zealand 52 Namibia 9\n\nMore changes for both sides. Namibia get a penalty for an infringement at the lineout.\n\nThey kick the ball into the All Blacks half.\n\n7:16AM\n\nAnton Lienert-Brown has been in eye-catching form today - will he start in the quarter-finals?\n\nAnton Lienert-Brown may have secured a starting spot with this performance Credit: Getty Images\n\n7:13AM\n\n59 min: New Zealand 52 Namibia 9\n\nThis game has become a procession. Namibia were so good for the first 30 minutes. Got to feel for them.\n\nNamibia get some ball for the first time in this half but they are pushed backwards. Cane forces a knock-on in a wide channel.\n\n7:10AM\n\n56 min: CON Barrett New Zealand 52 Namibia 9\n\nSimple conversion added. Namibia will want the final whistle already.\n\n7:10AM\n\n55 min: TRY! Whitelock New Zealand 50 Namibia 9\n\nBarrett sends an excellent kick long and Frizell then steals the ball at the lineout. He has been the standout forward for New Zealand in the loose.\n\nNew Zealand built through the phases just a few metres out. Another one. Whitelock dives at the base of the post scoring the try. Namibia are out on their feet here.\n\n7:07AM\n\nThese tries are becoming a little easy for New Zealand:\n\n7:06AM\n\n52 min: CON Barrett New Zealand 45 Namibia 9\n\nBarrett adds two more points - he has found his kicking boots now. New Zealand ring the changes.\n\n7:05AM\n\n52 min: TRY! Reece New Zealand 43 Namibia 9\n\nGoodhue carries through the middle from the lineout. The ball is switched back right and Sevu Reece breezes past his opposite man to score his second try. This is becoming very easy. Reece is some finisher.\n\n7:03AM\n\n50 min: New Zealand 38 Namibia 9\n\nNew Zealand are cutting loose here. Every time they get the ball they look likely to score. A cross-field kick is taken by Namibia but the counter attack is stopped as New Zealand win a penalty.\n\nThey kick the ball into the corner.\n\n7:01AM\n\n48 min: CON Barrett New Zealand 38 Namibia 9\n\nGood kick from Barrett who dissects the posts from the touch line.\n\n7:00AM\n\n47 min: TRY! Lienert-Brown New Zealand 36 Namibia 9\n\nThe ball is kicked back by Namibia and Barrett makes a break through the middle. He finds Goodhue and two passes later Lienert-Brown gets the ball. He beats one defender to score in the corner. His impressive performance continues.\n\n6:59AM\n\n45 min: New Zealand 31 Namibia 9\n\nNew Zealand attack again, this time from their own half. The ball finds Bridge on the left wing but his inside pass is intercepted and Namibia clear.\n\nAnother intercept by Klim! He was static when he took it unfortunately for Namibia.\n\nNamibia box-kick the ball away and Barrett claims the ball. A few phases pass before Barrett kicks the ball long.\n\n6:56AM\n\n43 min: CON Barrett New Zealand 31 Namibia 9\n\nBarrett drills the ball low over the posts. The All Blacks have started fast and are pulling away.\n\n6:55AM\n\n42 min: TRY! Moody New Zealand 29 Namibia 9\n\nBen Smith gets up for the ball and forces a knock on from Namibia. Scrum to New Zealand on the Namibian 22.\n\nNew Zealand attack left through Goodue. Taylor nearly breaks through before the forwards take control. Moody dives over the line from close range. Try time.\n\n6:53AM\n\nSecond half begins!\n\nNew Zealand get the game restarted, kicking the ball long.\n\n6:50AM\n\nJordie Barrett assessment\n\nThe utility back has looked very comfortable at fly half with ball in hand. His distribution has been good and his cross-field kick to Sevu Reece for the first try was sublime. However his kicking has not been so good. Barrett missed a couple of kicks at goal and has also made less distance than he should have done with kicks to touch on one or two occasions.\n\n7/10 so far.\n\nJordie Barrett follows in the footsteps of his older brother by starting in the number 10 jersey for the All Blacks Credit: Getty Images\n\n6:41AM\n\nKeep up to date with the Rugby World Cup with our Rugby Newsletters\n\n6:40AM\n\nHALF TIME! New Zealand 24 Namibia 9\n\nNamibia have been brilliant so far. They have exceeded all expectations looking threatening in attack and stoic in defence.\n\nThe All Blacks will be very upset with their first half performance but have still secured a bonus-point. There have been some clinical moves from the backs but far more errors than you normally see from the All Blacks.\n\n6:38AM\n\n40+5 min: CON Barrett New Zealand 24 Namibia 9\n\nBarrett adds to more points - and that is half time.\n\n6:38AM\n\n40+4 min: TRY! Ben Smith New Zealand 22 Namibia 9\n\nNew Zealand dominate the scrum and Savea picks from the base. Nothing comes of the attack and they go back to the penalty advantage from the scrum. The All Blacks choose to scrum again.\n\nSavea breaks to the right and another penalty is given away - this time just five metres out. We are into the 43rd minute. Another scrum is opted for.\n\nNamibia are on a yellow card warning here. The scrum is driven forward before Smith spreads the ball to the backs. Goodhue almost scores before A Smith fizzes a flat pass to Ben Smith who scores. Brilliant pass.\n\n6:33AM\n\n40 min: New Zealand 17 Namibia 9\n\nNamibia build through the phases in their own half before Savea gets on the ball. New Zealand attack down the left as the gong goes.\n\nLienert-Brown makes another break - he has been excellent so far. Penalty to New Zealand for offside.\n\nThe All Blacks opt for a scrum.\n\n6:31AM\n\n39 min: New Zealand 17 Namibia 9\n\nNamibia knock the ball on. The All Blacks are understandably frustrated with their first half efforts.\n\nSmith attacks down the short side off the scrum and kicks the ball straight into touch. Poor execution.\n\n6:28AM\n\n36 min: CON Barrett New Zealand 17 Namibia 9\n\nSimple kick and Barrett finally puts one over.\n\n6:28AM\n\n36 min: TRY! Ta'avao New Zealand 15 Namibia 9\n\nNamibia turn over the ball again and are on the attack. There is space out there but the ball is knocked on. New Zealand counter and Bridge kicks the ball in behind. Taylor scrags the Namibian player into touch.\n\nThe All Blacks take the lineout quickly, building through the forwards in the midfield. The ball is spread right then back left. Moody spills the ball but it goes backwards. New Zealand make steady progress and are just five metres out from the line.\n\nTa'avao - on due to the yellow card of his fellow tighthead - bursts over the line under the posts. That felt inevitable although Namibia did make New Zealand work for that.\n\n6:22AM\n\n32 min: New Zealand 10 Namibia 9\n\nNamibia are in the game - and are now against 14 men for 10 minutes.\n\nRetallick is off.\n\nNamibia cannot claim the ball from their lineout. Scrum to New Zealand.\n\n6:21AM\n\n31 min: YELLOW CARD! Laulala New Zealand 10 Namibia 9\n\nA high tackle is being reviewed by the TMO. It was Laulala - his forearm hits the head of Klim but to be fair the Namibian winger is very, very low to the ground.\n\nKlim was falling to the ground which saves the New Zealand tighthead prop. Yellow card!\n\n6:19AM\n\nHere is New Zealand's second try:\n\nSerious wheels from Lienert-Brown to bash his way in for New Zealand's second try#RWC2019#ITVRugbypic.twitter.com/hi8e0EHyOw \u2014 ITV Rugby (@ITVRugby) October 6, 2019\n\n6:18AM\n\n30 min: PEN Stevens New Zealand 10 Namibia 9\n\nNamibia break down the right wing after a box-kick ends up back in Namibian hands. Klim sprints down the wing but is tackled just in time.\n\nNamibia attack on New Zealand's 22. Deysel carries strongly in the midfield and there is another penalty to Namibia for not rolling away. Wow this has been some performance from Namibia so far.\n\nStevens adds another three points - only one point in it now! Steve Hansen will be livid with his side's indiscipline.\n\n6:15AM\n\nHere is New Zealand's first try:\n\nGuess what? Jordie Barrett can play 10 as well...\n\n\n\nReece steps his man in a phonebox to score#ITVRugby#RWC2019pic.twitter.com/Pz2VAQzoVt\n\n\n\n\u2014 ITV Rugby (@ITVRugby) October 6, 2019\n\n6:15AM\n\n26 min: PEN Stevens New Zealand 10 Namibia 6\n\nStevens slots the penalty from in front of the posts on the 10 metre line. Lead is cut to only four points 26 minutes in!\n\n6:14AM\n\n25 min: New Zealand 10 Namibia 3\n\nNamibia attack in New Zealand's half. Cane is offside and they have the advantage. Namibia are attacking from side to side but with little penetration as the All Blacks fan out. A kick through comes to nothing and they come back for the penalty.\n\n6:11AM\n\n21 min: MISSED CON Barrett New Zealand 10 Namibia 3\n\nAnother ropey kick that may well have been charged down.\n\n6:10AM\n\n21 min: TRY! Lienert-Brown New Zealand 10 Namibia 3\n\nLienert-Brown busts through the Namibian defence after some nice hands in the midfield. The centre hands off one defender before curving his run around the covering defence. Well worked try.\n\n6:09AM\n\n20 min: New Zealand 5 Namibia 3\n\nLienert-Brown carries in the midfield before another penalty is given away at the ruck. Van Jaarsveld gets the turnover penalty.\n\nNamibia spill the ball and New Zealand counter through Frizell who carries on the left wing. The ball exchanges possession before New Zealand attack again. Reece chips over the top but the ball is put down by Greyling over the goal line.\n\n6:06AM\n\n18 min: New Zealand 5 Namibia 3\n\nStevens box-kick is charged down with Retallick's face. Ouch. Stevens get the second box-kick out into touch. Good attacking position for New Zealand.\n\n6:04AM\n\n16 min: New Zealand 5 Namibia 3\n\nThe All Blacks dominate a scrum pushing Namibia back. A kick through comes to nothing again.\n\nNamibia will be delighted with this start. The All Blacks look dangerous every time that they have the ball but so have Namibia. New Zealand will be disappointed with their defence in the opening 15 minutes.\n\n6:02AM\n\n15 min: New Zealand 5 Namibia 3\n\nNamibia attack with potency from the lineout. Forbes carries strongly before a hole is burst through in the midfield. Successive line breaks have New Zealand scrambling. Penalty given away at the ruck. Brilliant attack from the underdogs.\n\nNew Zealand attack off the lineout. Cane makes a break but spills the ball forward when he tries to offload.\n\n5:59AM\n\n12 min: New Zealand 5 Namibia 3\n\nThe All Blacks build nicely through the phases before Retallick makes a half-break. Savea carries down the right side. This attack has slowly gained 40 odd metres.\n\nPenalty to Namibia! New Zealand off their feet.\n\n5:58AM\n\nPhil Davies was absolutely delighted with Namibia taking the lead...\n\n5:57AM\n\n9 min: New Zealand 5 Namibia 3\n\nNew Zealand break from deep through Frizell who offloads. Aaron Smith then kicks and Namibia carry the ball back before giving away a ruck penalty on half-way.\n\nSmith takes the penalty quickly but his grubber kick trickles off the pitch.\n\n5:55AM\n\n7 min: MISSED CON Barrett New Zealand 5 Namibia 3\n\nBarrett pulls the kick wide. Not a great effort that.\n\n5:54AM\n\n6 min: TRY! Reece New Zealand 5 Namibia 3\n\nNew Zealand win a penalty at the scrum. Jordie Barrett kicks the ball into the corner turning down a simple three points.\n\nRetallick wins the lineout and a maul is formed. Namibia stop its progress. A cross-field kick is pin point accurate and Sevu Reece claims the ball, brushing off a defender to score in the corner. Brilliant kick from Barrett.\n\n5:51AM\n\n4 min: PEN Stevens New Zealand 0 Namibia 3\n\nScrum half Stevens slots the penalty from the 10 metre line out towards touch. Brilliant kick. Namibia lead!\n\nNamibia then spill the ball from the restart. Scrum to New Zealand.\n\n5:49AM\n\n2 min: New Zealand 0 Namibia 0\n\nThe All Blacks send the ball long after receiving the kick. Namibia start brightly carrying hard into the New Zealand half winning a penalty.\n\nGreat start from the massive underdogs. They opt to kick for goal.\n\n5:47AM\n\nKick-off!\n\nNamibia get us underway.\n\n5:46AM\n\nSteve Hansen has confidence in Jordie Barrett to thrive at fly-half\n\nThe 22-year-old, the youngest of the three Barrett brothers in the squad, becomes the 14th player to be named as the starting flyhalf for New Zealand in the history of the World Cup.\n\nHansen's arm was twisted to an extent into naming Barrett at flyhalf, after he chose just two players -- Jordie's older brother Beauden and Richie Mo'unga -- as specialists in the side and decided to rest the pair against Namibia.\n\nJordie Barrett is arguably the first true utility player to wear the number 10 jersey at a World Cup for New Zealand, although Jon Preston was principally a scrumhalf when he started at flyhalf against the United States and Scotland in 1991.\n\nLuke McAlister mostly played inside centre before starting at flyhalf against Romania in 2007 while Colin Slade could play fullback and even appeared on the wing but was essentially a flyhalf at Super Rugby level.\n\nBarrett, however, has barely played the position at all since he first came to prominence as an inside centre for provincial side Canterbury in 2016 before he was converted to fullback in his first year at the Wellington Hurricanes in 2017.\n\nHe came off the bench as fullback against Samoa later that year to make his test debut and has notched 13 test caps in total, mostly as the last line of defence although he has also played wing, most recently against Canada on Wednesday.\n\nBarrett admitted he had not really played much at flyhalf in recent years, appearing in the position while playing club rugby in Christchurch and as cover for the Hurricanes.\n\nHansen, however said with their switch to having dual playmakers at flyhalf and fullback, Barrett was used to taking on the responsibility as the first receiver.\n\n\"He has been playing fullback (and) ... he has been doing a lot of what we have been doing at training anyway,\" Hansen told reporters. \"He will be looking forward to it.\"\n\nBarrett's youthful exuberance to play the game at a high tempo has caused some concerns for New Zealand rugby fans in the past.\n\nA quick throw-in ending in a try to South Africa during the Springbok's 36-34 victory in Wellington last year was seized upon by his critics as a sign of his erratic performances.\n\nHansen, however, said while Barrett wanted to \"do everything at 100 miles an hour\" he had been impressed with his composure, patience and control in his last few appearances for the All Blacks.\n\n\"He is aware of what he has to do ... and been working on it,\" Hansen said.\n\nReuters\n\n5:43AM\n\nThe national anthems are over\n\nJust the Haka stands between now and kick-off.\n\n5:41AM\n\nCan Jordie Barrett star at fly half?\n\nThe most interesting selection ahead of this game was Jordie Barrett starting at 10 without Richie Mo'unga or Beauden Barrett in the match day squad. Jordie Barrett is a versatile player and has the chance to star from centre stage potentially forcing himself into the All Black's strongest 23 going forward.\n\n5:38AM\n\nHere are the teams in full:\n\nNew Zealand: B. Smith, Reece, Goodhue, Liernert-Brown, Bridge, J. Barrett, A. Smith, Moody, Taylor, Laulala, Retallick, Whitelock, Frizzel, Cane, Savea\n\nReplacements: Coles, Tu'ungafasi, Taavao-Matau, Tuipulotu, Todd, Weber, Perenara, Ioane\n\nNamibia: Tromp, Klim, Newman, Deysel, Greyling, Kisting, Stevens, Rademeyer, van Jaarsveld, de Klerk, van Lill, Uanivi, Gaoseb, Forbes, Venter\n\nReplacements: Nortje, Theron, Coetzee, Retief, Booysen, Jantjies, de la Harpe, du Toit\n\nReferee: Pascal Gauzere (France)\n\n5:36AM\n\nMatch stats\n\nNew Zealand hasn't lost a match at the Rugby World Cup since a quarterfinal upset in 2007, a record streak of 16 wins at the sport's marquee tournament.\n\nNamibia hasn't won a match in 21 starts at the World Cup, and is the tournament's lowest-ranked team.\n\nSo there's two streaks that are almost certain to be extended on Sunday when the three-time champion All Blacks meet Namibia at Tokyo Stadium.\n\nNew Zealand won the only previous meeting between the teams 58-14 four years ago in England, with Johan Deysel crossing for Namibia's try and Theuns Kotze landing three penalty goals.\n\nAP", "description": "Defending champions New Zealand racked up the biggest points tally of the Rugby World Cup so far by running in 11 tries to hammer a spirited\u00a0Namibia\u00a0side 71-9 and charge back to the top of Pool B on Sunday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/lvtjxBBLmFPbBKc_R5GfNA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GjSz8Tq2PDtZRR3_nnEfBQ--~B/aD0xNTY0O3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/189fc1cf37bc234d279e937414fb1f81", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
