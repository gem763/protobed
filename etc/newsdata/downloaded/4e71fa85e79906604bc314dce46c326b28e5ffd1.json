The robot did laps around its inept human counterparts by autonomously assembling an Ikea chair in less than nine minutes.\n\nThat same team is behind NTU spin-off Eureka Robotics, which this morning debuted Archimedes, a six-axis robotic arm designed to pick up and manipulate optical lenses and mirrors. The functionality is decidedly less YouTube video-friendly than its furniture-assembling predecessor, but there\u2019s probably a lot more money to be made in optics.\n\nArchmides is capable of handling multiple-sized lenses and mirrors and loading them into a tray in order to be coated. Introducing a robotic arm into the process can help eliminate defects introduced by human interactions. The challenge, of course, is to create a robotic arm that can handle such delicate objects without damaging them in the process.\n\n\u201cWith Archimedes, we have taken accuracy to the tens-of-micron level,\u201d company co-founder and NTU Associate Professor Pham Quang Cuon said in a release tied to the news. \u201cIts accuracy of placing objects is within a tenth of a millimetre, yet it does so with the gentleness of a human touch, made possible by our control algorithms.\u201d\n\nThe robot debuts this week at a robotics trade event in Southeast Asia.", "description": "Last year, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore had a small viral sensation on its hands with the release of Ikea Bot.
