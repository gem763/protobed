No mention in the tributes of the corruption and the flip-flops.\n\nWhat remains for most is the memory of a likeable man, a man of culture (at least that was the image he cultivated), and a president who acted like a French president is supposed to - that is, projecting the permanent conviction that France, of course, is the best place in the world.\n\nChirac was born in 1932, the son of a bank manager. He served as head of state from 1995 to 2007 - making him France's second longest serving post-war president after his Socialist predecessor Francois Mitterrand. But his health steadily deteriorated after he stepped down until his death on Thursday.\n\nChirac also served as the French prime minister, but he was beset by a series of corruption scandals. In 2011, he was convicted of diverting public funds while serving as the mayor of Paris.\n\nDespite his failings, he won widespread support for his fierce opposition to French involvement in the Iraq War, and for being the first leader to recognise France's role in the war-time deportation of Jews.\n\nAmong his major domestic political reforms was a reduction of the presidential term of office from seven to five years, and the abolition of compulsory military service.\n\nHe moved during the course of his career from anti-European Gaullism to championing the European project and a European Union constitution that was then rejected by the majority of French voters.\n\nIn 2005, he suffered a stroke, and in 2014, his wife Bernadette said he would no longer speak in public, noting he had memory trouble.", "description": "The committed Europhile whose later years were blighted by corruption scandals has died aged 86.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07pcdg9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
