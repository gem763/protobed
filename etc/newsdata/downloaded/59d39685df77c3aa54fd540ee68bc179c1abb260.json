It\u2019s the risk of whether he\u2019s going to last. It\u2019s questionable whether he will play or not and we\u2019ll see over the next couple of days.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

If he isn\u2019t fit then there\u2019s an opportunity for someone else.\u201d\n\nRodgers said he will give Maddison \u201cevery chance\u201d of passing a fitness test and also confirmed that the rest of his squad was available.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a big talent and he\u2019s been great but what has pleased me this week has been the squad,\u201d said Rodgers.\n\n\u201cWe did very well here last week against Tottenham and then we made some changes in the week (at Luton) and the rhythm, intensity and speed in the team was still the same.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a really strong squad and everyone else is fit and ready.\u201d\n\nNewcastle have had a tough start to the season, winning just once so far under Steve Bruce, but Rodgers has backed his opposite number and is expecting a difficult test on Sunday at the King Power Stadium.\n\n\u201cIt was going to be difficult coming in after Rafa (Benitez) but Steve is a great manager who is very experienced,\u201d said Rodgers.\n\n\u201cThe more experience, the better you become. He\u2019s from the area, he knows the feelings of the people. There won\u2019t be anybody working harder to make it right there.\n\n\u201cHe understands what the club is about and, for us, we expect a very tough game.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "James Maddison is a major injury concern for Leicester ahead of their Premier League game against Newcastle.
