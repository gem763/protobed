She was 98 and one of the last links to a generation that upended international art.\n\nHer death, after being treated for a leg infection, was announced by McCormick Gallery in Chicago, which had represented her since 2002. Facing short-term memory loss in recent years, she had \u201clived in this great envelope of the moment,\u201d said gallery owner Tom McCormick, but continued unabated.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re an artist you make art,\u201d Ms. Abbott often said, explaining why she continued to work with paints, charcoals and oil crayons at her home in Southampton, N.Y. \u201cEvery day you have to go into the studio and work.\u201d\n\nRaised in a prominent Manhattan family, Ms. Abbott traced her ancestry to John Adams and visited the White House as a girl, once running headlong into President Franklin D. Roosevelt. \u201cI wasn\u2019t behaving very becomingly in those days,\u201d she said. By then she was drawing in earnest, following a passion that developed while she recovered from a childhood infection.\n\nMs. Abbott achieved early renown as a model, appearing on the cover of Vogue and Harper\u2019s Bazaar, but spurned her glamorous upbringing to move into a cold-water flat in the East Village in 1946. Immersing herself in the neighborhood\u2019s burgeoning avant-garde art scene, she befriended artist David Hare, studied under Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman, experimented with peyote while filling the canvas with vivid reds and greens, and discussed painting with Jackson Pollock over drinks at the Cedar Street Tavern.\n\nYears later, she recalled that the master painter had once assaulted her before she managed to fight him off. \u201cI hated Pollock,\u201d she said, according to Mary Gabriel\u2019s book \u201cNinth Street Women.\u201d \u201cHis way of making friends was to knock you down and get on top of you.\u201d\n\n\n\nMs. Abbott\u2019s 1952 painting \u201cImrie.\u201d (Collection of Art Enterprises Ltd./McCormick Gallery)\n\nMs. Abbott found a better friend (and sometime lover) in de Kooning, to whom she dedicated \u201cBill\u2019s Painting,\u201d an early-1950s work that featured broad brushstrokes of red, pink and orange. According to a biography by Mark Stevens and Annalyn Swan, de Kooning brought kerosene to warm Ms. Abbott\u2019s unheated 10th Street studio, taught her how to attain the right viscosity of paint, and advised her that \u201can artist is like a homespun philosopher.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe told me once that he was the love of her life, and he asked her twice to marry him,\u201d McCormick said. \u201cShe turned him down because it would have been the end of her career as a painter. He was too much of a handful.\u201d Nonetheless, the two artists maintained a friendship for decades, with Ms. Abbott frequently visiting de Kooning\u2019s home in Springs, on the East End of Long Island.\n\nMs. Abbott had found refuge in that area since childhood, when she summered at her grandmother\u2019s home in Southampton. Her work frequently drew on nature, including the changing light off the coast and the lush forests and hillsides of the Caribbean.\n\n\u201cWhile we often think of abstract expressionism in terms of bravado, I think that Mary Abbott\u2019s paintings were more about emotional gesture, about her inner response to the world,\u201d said Gwen Chanzit, a curator at the Denver Art Museum. In a 2016 video interview, Ms. Abbott recalled that \u201ctrying to do things representationally didn\u2019t work for me.\u201d Instead, she said, she found that could \u201ctalk\u201d through abstract art.\n\nMs. Abbott was not a part of the 1951 9th Street Art Exhibition, which helped introduce the world to abstract expressionism, but was exhibited for the next few years at the Stable Gallery in a series of influential shows centered on the New York avant-garde.\n\n\n\n\u201cBill\u2019s Painting,\u201d completed around 1951, was dedicated to Willem de Kooning. (Private Collection/McCormick Gallery)\n\nShe also gained increasing prominence after the 2016 exhibition \u201cWomen of Abstract Expressionism,\u201d which Chanzit organized in Denver, bringing together the work of artists including Helen Frankenthaler, Joan Mitchell, Elaine de Kooning, Lee Krasner and Ms. Abbott.\n\n\u201cShe was not an aggressive promoter of her work, so her modesty, as well as her sex, worked against her in the competitive environment of postwar contemporary art,\u201d said art historian Helen Harrison, director of the Pollock-Krasner House and Study Center. \u201cTo be fair, many of her male contemporaries were also overlooked and underrated, so she was in good company.\u201d\n\nMary Lee Abbott was born in New York City on July 27, 1921, and raised on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side. Her mother, Elizabeth Grinnell, was a poet and syndicated columnist; her father, Henry Livermore Abbott, was a World War I veteran who received the Navy Cross and retired as a captain. They divorced when Mary was young.\n\nShe studied at the Art Students League in New York and the Corcoran art school in Washington, and in 1943 married R. Lewis Teague, a painter in the Army and the son of eminent industrial designer Walter Dorwin Teague. They separated within three years, as Ms. Abbott began to focus on her painting.\n\nIn the East Village, she studied at the experimental Subjects of the Artist School, where she learned \u201cto draw imagination,\u201d as she put it, and turned fully toward abstract art. Ms. Abbott became one of only a handful of women invited to an artists\u2019 clique known as the Club, where she was assigned to collect membership fees.\n\n\u201cAs much as the guys liked to pinch a penny they liked pinching me even more, and I was able to get them to hand over their dues,\u201d she told McCormick in an interview.\n\nIn 1949, Ms. Abbott met businessman Tom Clyde; they were both in the U.S. Virgin Islands, formalizing their respective divorces. They married the next year, and his poor health led them to spend winters in Haiti and St. Croix, where Ms. Abbott chased down snakes and worked on her paintings. That marriage ended in divorce as well.\n\nMs. Abbott taught at the University of Minnesota in the 1970s before returning to New York, where she bought a modest ranch house in Southampton and kept a studio in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan. As the neighborhood gentrified, she said she became known as \u201cthe crazy art lady on 3,\u201d sullying the building\u2019s buttoned-down reputation before selling about a decade ago.\n\nSurvivors include a half sister.\n\nIn a 2003 interview with the East Hampton Star, Ms. Abbott recalled that she was 9 when she fell ill with an infection behind her ear, later complicated by pneumonia, that persisted for two bedridden years and marked a break from years spent frolicking outdoors. \u201cAs a child, I had been with everything \u2014 animals, plants. I didn\u2019t see beauty; I was in it, I was part of it.\u201d\n\nHer infection, she added, launched her into a new relationship with nature and art. \u201cOne morning I woke up and looked out the window, at two pine trees that had been named after my brother and I when we were born, Billy and Mary. I realized I wasn\u2019t with beauty and nature anymore; I was seeing it from the outside. So for the rest of my life I\u2019d paint to get with it again.\u201d", "description": "Her work was often compared to Willem de Kooning, her friend and sometime lover.", "authors": ["Harrison Smith", "Obituary Writer", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/8-nghCouGC-6E9DSLLPCFq5VMW0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NNRI3ZXFMAI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg"}
