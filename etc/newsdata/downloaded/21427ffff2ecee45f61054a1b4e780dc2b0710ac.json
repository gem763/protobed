Taylor Jr., acting ambassador to Ukraine, testified last week that Morrison told him that Gordon Sondland, the U.S. envoy to the European Union, relayed to a top Ukraine aide that the country wouldn\u2019t receive military aid money until the Ukrainian president agreed to pursue an investigation into Joe Biden\u2019s son.\n\nMorrison\u2019s departure from the National Security Council removes an important vestige of Bolton\u2019s tenure in the administration. Bolton handpicked Morrison to join the NSC because of his shared opposition to arms control agreements, which both men view as an unacceptable constraint on American power.\n\nAD\n\nHe is a staunch foe of nuclear nonproliferation advocates who view arms control accords as the only workable means to reducing the risk of nuclear war and managing defense budgets.\n\nAD\n\nDuring his tenure, Morrison oversaw the U.S. withdrawal from the Reagan-era Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces and continued to look for ways the U.S. could pull out of other nuclear accords.\n\nThis summer, Morrison lobbied Republican offices to urge them not to support an amendment to a defense authorization bill encouraging the administration to extend a landmark nuclear arms reduction treaty known as New START, which expires in February 2021.\n\nAnne Gearan contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "Tim Morrison has been on the job for about 15 months, joining the security council during former national security adviser John Bolton\u2019s tenure.", "authors": ["Carol D.
