Central banks create electronic money to buy up safe-haven bonds, which forces down market interest rates and pushes investors and their bankers back into taking riskier real-world growth investments. With the global recovery slowing again, the likes of the European Central Bank has been proposing further rounds of QE, this time not as a last-ditch defence but as a pre-emptive strike at the first signs of trouble. But now here in Australia, which escaped the global financial crisis, Goldman Sachs reckons that the Reserve Bank of Australia could by next year turn to a $200 billion QE program if conventional rate cuts fail to get more Australians into work and use this \u201cspare capacity\u201d in the economy to reinvigorate growth.\n\nQE answers the call on policymakers to \u201cdo something\u201d. But it is also a trap, hard to reverse, but which becomes less and less effective the longer it's used. It takes away the normal disciplines that the bond markets would apply to governments with conventionally borrowed money. It tips more easy money into the community, but Australia is already stretched on housing affordability and household debt \u2013 the wealth effect would mainly flow to the already wealthy. It would bring down the Australian dollar, another shot in the currency wars. But the dollar has hardly been at elevated levels, and we already have an export boom underway.\n\nAll that can be said for QE is that it might avoid a bigger shock to public confidence if the cash rate was cut down to zero or below \u2013 which would far outweigh any benefit from super cheap money.\n\nShowers of cash will not flow to the right places. iStock\n\nEven as RBA governor Philip Lowe pulled the rate lever again this week, he warned everybody not to expect too much. What he really wants is for the federal government to pick up some of the job through direct fiscal policy, using the super-low interest rates to borrow and build. But the government does not want to risk its hard-won surplus by rowing back on years of spending discipline. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg rightly sees the surplus as a badge of good management of the economy that makes others confident enough to invest. Besides, fiscal spending has limits too. There are already huge federal and state infrastructure pipelines that cannot be easily speeded up.\n\nAnd we have just fought an election that was all about putting growth before redistribution, and stopping the pile up of more and more burdens on business. The big question here is not how much more cheap capital or government stimulus can be applied. It is why no form of easy money has so far induced or tempted the private sector to risk more capital in growing the economy. Perhaps their hurdle rates have failed to adjust to the low rate era. But pumping up of asset prices, governments going back into deficit to hand out cash splash spending, or overloading on infrastructure spending are hardly ways to improve the investment climate.\n\nKeynesian economics was fond of motor metaphors. All that was needed was a bit of pump-priming to get economies moving again. But all these policies are doing is pouring ever more fuel into a defective engine. The motor has too many other blocked pipes of labour inflexibility and excessive taxes for it to run properly anyway, as Dr Lowe has also highlighted. The spillover of excess fuel runs away into asset bubbles. But the other lasting damage of easy money is that it has so far relieved politicians of the political effort of reforming and repairing those supply-side impediments. Bringing QE to Australia is not going to help that.", "description": "Monetary policy and fiscal policy have their place, but not to put off essential reforms to Australia's economic fundamentals", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3775%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_376/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/dee1d461a327189801340e9ea874fb86c3d7583d", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
