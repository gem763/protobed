That is the fear.\u201d\n\nAs well as the pollution they emit the devices are large, sometimes weighing 200 tonnes, and increase the amount of fuel a ship consumes.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

They\u2019ve got a conflict between the threat to the viability of their port in the long-term future from escalating pollution versus keeping their port open for business in the short term.\n\n\u201cObviously, there are parts of the shipping industry that are applying pressure on ports to downplay this risk from their ships.\u201d\n\nThe British Ports Association says that it is yet to see convincing studies that address its concerns about the impact of scrubber discharge on sediments over a time period of five or 10 years.\n\n\u201cThe shipping industry says that the amount that goes into ports is so small that it will not cause any problem, but we have yet to see data that confirms this in the long term,\u201d said Mr Simmonds.\n\n\u201cThe UK government is usually very cautious on environmental things \u2013 and normally uses the principle that you can\u2019t do anything unless you can prove that it won\u2019t cause any harm.\n\n\u201cWhereas with the shipping industry the IMO [the UN body that regulates international shipping] seem to take the opposite view \u2013 you can do this unless you prove it is harmful. For me that is the wrong way around.\n\n\u201cMany ports are working hard to improve water quality and sediment quality and we don\u2019t want to see the progress that has been made already reversed because of increasing volumes of scrubber washwater being discharged.\u201d\n\nThe International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), a nonprofit organisation that provides scientific analysis to environmental regulators, also believes that the risk of contamination over the long term is a major concern.\n\n\u201cThere has been some research on the composition of scrubber discharge and the concentrations and there is some research under way looking at where the contaminants might go \u2013 but the really important thing that we haven\u2019t yet gotten a good handle on is the accumulation problem,\u201d said Bryan Comer, a senior researcher at ICCT.\n\nHe said IMO guidelines, which are set out in terms of concentrations that are being emitted rather than the absolute quantity of pollutants being discharged, are not fit for purpose.\n\n\u201cEven if a ship is complying with those guidelines, it doesn\u2019t address the issue that you are going to see these contaminants accumulate in the sediment and in the food chain as well,\u201d he said.\n\nShipping companies that have invested heavily in scrubbers include British-American cruise company Carnival, which has spent more than $500m developing and installing them.\n\nMaersk, the world\u2019s largest container ship and supply vessel operator, has also fitted scrubbers on vessels after initially opposing the technology.\n\nIn a statement to The Independent, Roger Frizzell, a spokesman for Carnival, denied claims ship owners have failed to make data on scrubber discharges available to ports or carry out sufficient research into the long-term impact on sediments.\n\n\u201cWe have undertaken the installation of these systems with a slow methodical scientific-based approach, ship by ship, over the past several years,\u201d he said.\n\nMaersk said that scrubbers will only be used on a limited number of vessels in its feet.\n\nIt added: \u201cWhile our IMO 2020 fuel sourcing strategy focuses on compliant fuels for the vast majority of our fleet, we have decided to invest in a number of scrubbers to mitigate risk and familiarise with the technology in case it turns out to provide significant cost benefits compared to compliant fuels.\u201d\n\nIn a statement the IMO said that its guidelines are under review and all external input and studies will be welcomed.\n\nIn a statement to The Independent, the Clean Shipping Alliance, a lobby group for companies that have invested in scrubbing technology, said that discharge from the devices is safe for marine ecosystems.\n\n\u201cThere is well documented evidence relating to the composition of scrubber washwater,\u201d a spokesperson said.", "description": "Environmental \u201ccheat\u201d devices fitted to thousands of ships could render some UK ports unusable by contaminating sediment and increasing the cost of dredging, authorities fear. Last month, The Independent revealed that the global shipping industry has spent more than $12bn (\u00a39.7bn) on installing devices to comply with new environmental legislation that end up polluting the sea", "authors": ["Wil Crisp"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/25/16/uk-port.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
