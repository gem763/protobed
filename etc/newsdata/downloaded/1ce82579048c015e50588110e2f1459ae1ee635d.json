(Stephen B. Morton/AP)\n\nThe eventful week of Jacksonville Jaguars cornerback Jalen Ramsey continued to bring unexpected twists Wednesday when Coach Doug Marrone announced that the cornerback would leave the team for the birth of his child.\n\nRamsey was to travel to Tennessee and will rejoin the Jaguars \u201cwhen he\u2019s ready,\u201d Marrone said in a written statement released by the team.\n\n\u201cMonths ago in the offseason, Jalen notified me that he was expecting the birth of his second child in late September,\u201d Marrone said.\n\n\u201cWe spoke about this recently and again today after practice and decided that it was best for Jalen to fly to Nashville tonight after meetings to be with his family during the birth of their daughter. He will return to the team when he\u2019s ready, and we will provide an update at that time.\u201d\n\nStatement from Head Coach Doug Marrone on CB Jalen Ramsey. pic.twitter.com/Snja5pJaGY \u2014 #DUUUVAL (@Jaguars) September 25, 2019\n\nThe Jaguars, who to this point have not accommodated Ramsey\u2019s request to be traded, are scheduled to play Sunday at Denver. They\u2019re coming off their first victory of the season, a triumph last Thursday night at home over the Tennessee Titans.\n\nRamsey\u2019s missed Monday\u2019s practice and was said to have the flu. He then missed Wednesday\u2019s practice with what was said to be back tightness. Marrone initially told reporters he didn\u2019t know when Ramsey suffered the injury, but the team later said that Ramsey had informed the Jaguars\u2019 medical staff during Thursday\u2019s game that he was suffering from back tightness.\n\nJaguars owner Shad Khan is reportedly reluctant to trade Ramsey, who has proclaimed himself the NFL\u2019s top cornerback. Ramsey made his trade request following the Jaguars\u2019 Week 2 loss at Houston, in which he had a sideline disagreement with Marrone, and later said that \u201csome disrespectful things\u201d were said to him during a subsequent meeting with team officials.\n\n\u201cSome disrespectful things were said on their end that made me definitely walk out and call my agent as soon as I walked out,\u201d Ramsey said on an \u201cUninterrupted\u201d podcast, according to Pro Football Talk. \u201cI said, \u2018It\u2019s time. My time is up here in Jacksonville.\u2019 I said, \u2018I want to ask for a trade.\u2019 I was truly at peace, like I wasn\u2019t in a mind-set of making a decision while I was angry. I was completely calm. I still stand by that decision to ask for a trade.\u201d\n\nThere were initial reports that the Jaguars were seeking a pair of first-round draft choices in trade deliberations for Ramsey. But the emergence of rookie quarterback Gardner Minshew and the win over Titans, in which the Jaguars defense sacked Tennessee quarterback Marcus Mariota nine times, may have reinforced Khan\u2019s belief that Ramsey should not be traded, a move that perhaps would signal to fans that the team was giving up on its season.\n\nThe Jaguars reached the AFC championship game in the 2017 season but went 5-11 last season before signing quarterback Nick Foles, the former Super Bowl MVP for the Philadelphia Eagles, in free agency. Foles suffered a broken left clavicle in the season opener. But Minshew, an unheralded sixth-round draft choice, has stepped in and played extremely well, reviving hopes in Jacksonville that the Jaguars are capable of contending this season.\n\nRead more on the NFL:", "description": "Coach Doug Marrone says Ramsey, who missed practices due to illness and injury earlier in the week, will rejoin the team \"when he\u2019s ready.\"", "authors": ["Mark Maske", "Sports Reporter Covering The Nfl", "September At Pm", "Mark Maske Covers The Nfl For The Washington Post.
