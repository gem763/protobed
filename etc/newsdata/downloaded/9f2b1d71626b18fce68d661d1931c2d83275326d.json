It groups JxCAT and ERC but has lost the support of the leftwing anti-capitalist Popular Unity Candidacy (CUP), which is crucial for him to have a majority.\n\nThe divisions are also evident between civil society groups, with the two biggest groups ANC and Omnium Cultural growing apart as hardliners from the Committees for the Defence of the Republic (CDR) have surged to the fore.\n\n\u201cThere is a big mess within the pro-independence world, the outlook is very confusing,\u201d said Botella. \u201cNobody knows who is in charge and that blocks everything.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Response to the verdict \u2013\n\nPro-separatist parties and associations have vowed to unite and \u201crespond en masse\u201d to the verdict with demonstrations, roadblocks and a possible strike, but have pledged it will involve \u201cnon-violent struggle and peaceful civil disobedience\u201d.\n\nAfter years of large-scale demonstrations which for the most part have been peaceful, police said in late last month they had arrested a group of separatists on suspicion of preparing violent attacks, charging seven of them with belonging to a \u201cterrorist organisation\u201d.\n\nThe arrests have raised concerns about the radicalisation of fringe elements within the separatist movement.\n\n\u2013 Broken dialogue \u2013\n\nAnd the tension has led to some sharp exchanges between the government of Pedro Sanchez and Catalonia\u2019s pro-independence leadership, with the Spanish premier demanding they firmly condemn violence.\n\nShould things turn nasty, Sanchez said he would not hesitate to renew a suspension of Catalan autonomy.\n\nWhen the Socialist leader took power in June 2018, due in part to support from separatist parties, there was a brief honeymoon period which saw Sanchez and Torra promising to pursue dialogue to find \u201ca democratic response\u201d to the Catalan crisis.\n\nMadrid has, however, shown no flexibility in its stance on the separatists\u2019 request for a legally binding independence referendum.\n\nBut by February, all bets were off as the leaders\u2019 trial opened at the Supreme Court in Madrid, and a day later, the separatist parties voted down the budget in parliament.\n\nSanchez then called early elections for April but the outcome was inconclusive, prompting yet another general election that will be held in November.", "description": "Barcelona (AFP) \u2013 Divided and deadlocked since the failure of their 2017 secession bid, Catalan separatists are hoping Spain\u2019s jailing of nine", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/14/b975fd_catalan-leaders-put-on-trial-role-in-failed-independence-bid-2017-unsuccessful-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
