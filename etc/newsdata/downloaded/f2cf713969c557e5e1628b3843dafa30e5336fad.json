White House\n\n\"You don't want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people,\" wrote Trump, \"and I don't want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy \u2014 and I will.\"\n\nHe went on to caution Erdogan: \"History will look upon you favorably if you get this done the right and humane way. It will look upon you forever as the devil if good things don't happen.\"\n\n\"I will call you later,\" Trump signed off his letter.\n\nThe Turkish president said on Wednesday he will only end Turkey's offensive in northern Syria if Kurdish-led forces withdraw.\n\nIt would be the fastest way to end the conflict, he said, adding that he was not willing to negotiate on his position.\n\nThe US House of Representatives earlier on Wednesday voted overwhelmingly to condemn President Donald Trump's withdrawal of American forces from northern Syria.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans banded together and approved a nonbinding resolution, which states Congress' opposition to the troop pullback and says Turkey should cease its military action in Syria.\n\nThe measure said the White House should present a plan for an \"enduring defeat\" of IS.", "description": "The US president cautioned Erdogan: \"History will look upon you favorably if you get this done the right and humane way.
