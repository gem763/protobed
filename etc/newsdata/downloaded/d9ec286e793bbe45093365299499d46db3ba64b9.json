Another piece of nonbinding legislation commended Canada for its response to a U.S. request to extradite Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies, who was arrested in Vancouver over a year ago.\n\nU.S. stock futures pulled back slightly on Wednesday, with Dow Jones Industrial Average YM00, -0.32% down 45 points to 26,958, and the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond TMUBMUSD10Y, -2.76% dropping 3 basis points to 1.7423%.\n\nGeng said while China was working to restore law and order in Hong Kong, U.S. lawmakers were \u201cdisregarding and distorting facts,\u201d by turning criminal acts and violence against police into issues of \u201chuman rights or democracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is a stark double standard. It fully exposes the shocking hypocrisy of some in the U.S. on human rights and democracy and their malicious intention to undermine Hong Kong\u2019s prosperity and stability to contain China\u2019s development,\u201d said Geng, who urged the U.S. to \u201cstop meddling.\u201d\n\nThe comments come as the U.S. and China continue to work toward a trade agreement, with a partial deal announced last week \u2014 though caution emerged amid reports Beijing wants further meetings before moving forward.\n\nProtests in Hong Kong have intensified and turned violent at times in the past months, amid objections by demonstrators to an extradition bill proposed by the territory\u2019s government. The movement has ensnared U.S. businesses and even, more recently, the National Basketball Association after Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted support for the Hong Kong protesters.\n\nRead: Angry pro-democracy lawmakers shout down Hong Kong\u2019s Carrie Lam\n\nMeanwhile, Los Angeles Laker\u2019s NBA star LeBron James has attracted ire from Hong Kong protesters, who reportedly stamped on and burned a jersey with his name on it Tuesday after he suggested that free speech had consequences.", "description": "China\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesperson has warned of \u201cstrong countermeasures\u201d against the U.S. that if it passes three bills aimed at supporting Hong Kong...", "authors": ["Barbara Kollmeyer", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT387_hongko_ZG_20191016024504.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
