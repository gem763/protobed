The intended target, 32-year-old Robert Dreyfus, convinced one of the teens to get into his car \u201cto talk,\u201d the San Diego County Sheriff\u2019s Department said. Then, he drove off with the 17-year-old girl.\n\nAmateur sex stings targeting potential predators are a growing trend, and authorities are now pointing to Sunday\u2019s alleged kidnapping as a prime example of why they\u2019re a bad idea. Though cops soon came to the rescue \u2014 the 17-year-old managed to send a text message to her friends, who called 911 \u2014 officials warned on Monday that online vigilantes who try to stage public confrontations are putting themselves in serious danger.\n\nThe social media-fueled phenomenon has become a source of frustration for law enforcement officials nationwide. Loosely inspired by the short-lived but wildly popular NBC show, which was canceled in 2008 after a suspect committed suicide, so-called \u201cpredator hunters\u201d troll dating sites and apps favored by teens. Using fake photos and identities to pose as underage, they convince their targets to meet them in a public place. Often, the ensuing confrontation is broadcast live on Facebook, with commenters rushing to identify the alleged predator.\n\nThough some busts have led to arrests and guilty pleas, aspiring undercover sleuths have also wound up settling lawsuits for defamation, or getting punched. Police have repeatedly warned the amateur crime-fighters that they are putting themselves at risk by entering a volatile situation that would ordinarily call for backup and body armor, and that there\u2019s a good chance that the \u201cevidence\u201d they are gathering may not actually be legally admissible in court.\n\nPredator hunters have also come under fire for publicly shaming people who have not yet been charged or convicted of a crime, sometimes with disastrous consequences. Last year, a 20-year-old Connecticut man committed suicide after he was confronted by a live-streaming vigilante from a group called POPSquad, who had posed as a teen boy to lure him to an empty house.\n\nAn NBC News investigation in January found more than 30 similar predator-hunting groups on Facebook, spanning 23 states. Though some individual posts and accounts, and one of the groups, were removed from the platform in January after the outlet questioned whether the online vigilantes\u2019 tactics amounted to cyberbullying, they\u2019ve continued to proliferate. Steven Kohm, a cultural criminologist at the University of Winnipeg, told NBC News that the fad could be linked to the same mistrust in authority that has spawned conspiracy theories like Pizzagate and QAnon, as well as a desire for mob justice.\n\n\u201cCriminal justice used to be emotional and participatory,\u201d Kohm explained. \u201cOver the last 100 years, it\u2019s become mostly hidden and dominated by professionals. People are yearning to reconnect with the punitive emotional core of the justice system. These groups focusing on the pedophile, a universally reviled category, helps them connect with the lost aspect of the justice system.\u201d\n\nOnline predator hunters argue that their work is necessary because police aren\u2019t doing enough to stop potential pedophiles. \u201cI say there is a bigger problem than police can handle, and citizens who have some training should be able to assist police like this,\u201d Anthony Greene, the founder of Truckers Against Predators, recently told the Springfield News-Leader.\n\nThe Missouri-based trucker, who himself is a survivor of abuse, told the paper that he has conducted more than 100 sting operations in the past year, orchestrating meetups wherever his work takes him. Men show up thinking they are going to have sex with a teen girl, only to be greeted instead by a burly, 300-pound trucker. In June, a man who Greene confronted at a truck stop in Yuma, Ariz., was sentenced to five years in prison after being found guilty of luring a minor for sexual exploitation.\n\n\u201cI feel like the cause is worth it,\u201d Greene told the News-Leader. \u201cOur kids are worth it. Something needs to be done more about these pedophiles.\u201d\n\nGreene and other predator hunters are eager to share their findings with the police, handing over reams of videos, photos, and potentially compromising messages. But if law enforcement officials don\u2019t seem appreciative, it\u2019s because actually securing a conviction is somewhat more challenging. Citizen vigilantes who belong to groups with names like \u201cParents Against Predators Nationwide\u201d and \u201c417 Predator Hunters\u201d generally haven\u2019t been trained on how to conduct an undercover investigation, and authorities sometimes find that there simply isn\u2019t enough evidence to justify pressing charges.\n\nIn other cases, prosecutors\u2019 hands are tied. In Missouri and Ohio, for instance, an individual can only be charged with child enticement if their victim is a minor, or an undercover law enforcement officer posing as a minor. Adults who take it upon themselves to pose as teens aren\u2019t doing police any favors, and some officials worry that the highly-publicized amateur stings may actually do more harm than good since they run the risk of sending suspected pedophiles underground.\n\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re doing is of zero impact to law enforcement,\u201d one Ohio investigator told the Cincinnati Enquirer last year. \u201cThey\u2019re not generating anything we can use.\u201d\n\nStill, stories about civilians bringing down alleged predators often make for great headlines. In 2017, an Oklahoma father discovered that his 15-year-old daughter was exchanging sexually explicit text messages with a 33-year-old man, and posed as the teenager to lure the older man to a tent in their backyard for sex. Several family members who were lying in wait pounced on the man when he arrived, then zip-tied his hands and feet to make sure he couldn\u2019t escape before cops arrived. It\u2019s unclear if the man ever faced criminal charges.\n\n[Watch family\u2019s backyard sting to catch man allegedly seeking sex with teen daughter]\n\nAnother high-profile bust took place this summer, when a 20-year-old man in the San Francisco Bay area used Snapchat\u2019s gender-swap filter to pose as a teenage girl, then took screen shots of the sexually explicit text messages that were allegedly sent to him by a local cop and handed them over to law enforcement. Though the officer was arrested and placed on leave, local prosecutors later emphasized that they strongly discourage other civilians from trying the same tactic at home.\n\n[\u2018I was just looking to get someone\u2019: Snapchat\u2019s gender-swap filter inspires a sting operation]\n\nSunday\u2019s failed sting exemplified the dangers of a DIY approach to criminal justice, but it did lead to a rare arrest: Dreyfus was jailed on suspicion of kidnapping, sending harmful matter to a minor and communication with a minor for specific offenses. It\u2019s not clear whether he has an attorney.\n\nThough the 17-year-old girl was unharmed, officials took the opportunity to warn any other aspiring sleuths that undercover investigations are best left to the professionals.\n\n\u201cThe Sheriff\u2019s Department strongly discourages the public from setting up meetings or contacting anyone for the purpose of catching an individual who is committing a crime,\u201d officials warned on Monday. \u201cThese types of situations can be extremely dangerous and should be handled by your local law enforcement agency.\u201d", "description": "Though some busts have led to arrests and guilty pleas, aspiring undercover sleuths have also wound up settling lawsuits for defamation, or getting punched.", "authors": ["Antonia Noori Farzan", "Reporter For The Morning Mix", "October At Am", "Antonia Noori Farzan Is A Reporter On The Washington Post'S Morning Mix Team.
