For Democrats, the accord is a way to give lawmakers from swing districts a broadly popular achievement to show constituents and a way to counter criticism that they have accomplished little during their time in Washington, which has more often consisted of passing legislation that dies in the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nThat has become even more important now that House Democrats are actively engaged in an impeachment inquiry that could lead to the president\u2019s ouster. Democrats who represent Republican-leaning districts are facing a potential backlash from Republican and independent voters angry over the Democrats\u2019 emphasis on impeachment, and they are looking for ways to show that they can still produce policies that benefit Americans.\n\n\u201cWe are going to demonstrate that simultaneously you can govern,\u201d said Rep. Richard E. Neal, D-Mass., who leads the Ways and Means Committee and is leading a delegation to Mexico for a meeting on Tuesday with President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador of Mexico to seek final assurances over aspects of the trade agreement.\n\nLeading Democrats also see the agreement as a vehicle to achieve some major progressive goals that would otherwise be impossible to extract from a Republican administration. Republicans are considering potential sweeteners for Democrats, including a plan to shore up pensions that has been sought by Neal and labor unions.\n\nHouse Democrats and Robert Lighthizer, the U.S. trade representative, have been exchanging proposals and counterproposals with House Democrats for weeks trying to satisfy their demands for labour and environmental guarantees. Both sides say the confidential talks have produced results that are leading to increasing confidence that Pelosi will put the measure on the floor relatively soon.\n\n\u201cIt has been a patient give-and-go, and I think we have moved the ball toward the goal,\u201d Neal said.\n\nEven Democrats skeptical of a trade deal based on their previous experience said the talks with Lighthizer, who has built credibility with the lawmakers, have been substantive and helpful.\n\n\u201cWe have been having conversations for I think over a year, and the Democrats made very serious, thoughtful proposals around issues that we have been consistent on over the years,\u201d said Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, a member of a Democratic trade working group appointed by the speaker to work out party concerns over the agreement.\n\nBut DeLauro, who opposed NAFTA and was an early critic of the failed Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, was not quite ready to sign off.\n\n\u201cWe are making headway,\u201d DeLauro said. \u201cOur view is that when it is right, we will go. We are not there yet.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have objected to several elements of the deal, none more strongly than a provision that extends protections to pharmaceutical companies for new products, which they argue could hamper their efforts to lower the cost of prescription drugs with legislation.\n\nDemocrats say their main fear is that Mexico will not enforce the provisions of the trade deal in areas such as minimum wage requirements and environmental standards, and that the United States will not be allowed to make inspections to determine whether the agreement is being followed. They were alarmed by news reports of labour department budget cuts in Mexico, a fear the Mexican government has raced to alleviate.\n\nRepublicans lobbying for the agreement argue that supporting it should be an easy choice for Democrats who have long criticized NAFTA, since the new version amounts to an update with several far more progressive elements than the existing agreement, such as new minimum pay levels.\n\nSen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, a former chief trade negotiator for President George W. Bush, is a leading proponent of the agreement and has been trying to sell Democrats on its merits.\n\n\u201cIf you vote \u2018no\u2019 on this, that means you are saying, \u2018Let\u2019s go with NAFTA,\u2019 and politically for most Democrats, NAFTA is a four-letter word,\u201d Portman said. \u201cI just think logic prevails in the end.\u201d\n\nMore than that, some Democrats believe the trade agreement is their best prospect for achieving some bipartisan success in such a highly polarized environment.\n\n\u201cPeople understand and appreciate that we\u2019re trying to get to \u2018yes,\u2019 and we\u2019re trying to get it right,\u201d said Rep. Lizzie Fletcher, D-Texas.\n\nFletcher, who represents the greater Houston area, noted in an interview the number of trade relationships between her district and both countries in the new trade agreement, and said that sealing the deal would show that the gridlocked Congress could achieve some consensus.\n\n\u201cPeople really want to know about how we\u2019re working together and where there\u2019s bipartisan agreement,\u201d she added. \u201cThey want to know that we\u2019re trying to solve real problems.\u201d\n\nRep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., said that the trade deal represents a rare instance of a consequential measure that could pass the House without falling victim to Republican resistance in the other chamber or in the White House.\n\n\u201cThe notable thing about USMCA is that it\u2019s also a priority for the Senate and for the president,\u201d Spanberger said of the new trade deal, known as the USMCA. \u201cThat hasn\u2019t been the case for some of our most impactful legislation.\u201d\n\nTo move the agreement forward, Democrats will need to conclude that the deal is beneficial enough to them that they are willing to share credit with Trump over an accomplishment that he will undoubtedly herald in his reelection campaign. Pelosi, who voted for NAFTA in the House, has told colleagues she wants to get the new trade agreement approved, and has made clear that she hopes Democrats can separate the impeachment fight and the trade deal.\n\n\u201cThey have nothing to do with each other,\u201d said Pelosi, who added that if the president did not work with Democrats because they questioned his conduct, \u201cthen the ball is in his court.\u201d\n\nDespite the priority the Trump administration and congressional Republicans have put on the trade agreement, some concern has arisen in recent days that Trump, furious over the impeachment showdown, would pull back on the agreement and try to blame Democrats for its collapse, saying they could not get it done because of a single-minded focus on impeachment.\n\n\u201cThe Do Nothing Democrats don\u2019t have time to get it done!\u201d Trump tweeted Thursday about the trade deal.\n\nUltimately, backers of the agreement believe, the White House will embrace congressional approval of the long-sought agreement as a major victory for the president.\n\n\u201cWe are pretty bullish,\u201d said Neil Bradley, executive vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \u201cThe speaker is saying all the right things, and they are actually making progress in the negotiations.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d he said, \u201cyou want to show that impeachment is not the only thing you are focused on.\u201d", "description": "The escalating impeachment drama may be helping trade deal\u2019s prospects", "authors": ["Carl Hulse And Emily Cochrane", "The New York Times"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/nafta.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
