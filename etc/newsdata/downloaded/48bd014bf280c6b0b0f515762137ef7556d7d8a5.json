I may have gone over by three,' Emily laughed.\n\n'Nine drinks?', Phil chortled as Emily replied, 'My hangovers are still surprisingly light'.\n\nThe Inbetweeners star was on the show to chat about her new book Are We There Yet?, which touches upon highly personal subjects like her parents' divorce and being bullied as a teenager.\n\nFeeling merry: The star, 29, was teased by Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield about her alcohol consumption at the star-studded event the night before\n\nLucky escape: 'Nine drinks?', Phil chortled as Emily replied, 'My hangovers are still surprisingly light'\n\nEnjoying herself: Emily certainly wasn't going to let her early morning appearance stop her from having fun at the event\n\nProbed about her parents' split, Emily said: 'My parents are terrified... I'm just very honest about things! Growing up it was chaotic.'\n\n'I lived in a freelance entertainment household. I was smothered with love.\n\n'I didn't have the regular upbringing. I thought it was normal to come home and Les Dennis was sat on my uniform.\n\n'I was proud of it because I knew it was different. Everyone, all my friends would pile round my house.\n\nNew book: The Inbetweeners star was on the show to chat about her new book Are We There Yet?, which touches upon highly personal subjects like her parents' divorce and being bullied\n\nEmily also revealed she was bullied by some of her peers, who pulled cruel pranks on her.\n\nShe said: 'when you look back if you've been through bullying, I don't think everybody knows the impact.\n\n'They stuck a photo up of me around some of the villages and put my number so everybody could prank call me. They thought it was funny. It really stuck with me.'\n\nComing over all maternal, Holly told the I'm A Celebrity star: 'You're an open book, a very kind person, a very happy person but inside you have had bouts of depression, overwhelming sadness.'\n\nIn conversation: Emily opened up to Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby on the programme\n\nEmily explained: 'I've met a lot of people in life. I find people that do suffer with depression its the ones with the bigger smiles.\n\n'If you are suffering with something internally you don't want to show it. Growing up with bullying, things really do stay with you now.\n\n'If people are ever in my presence, I want to remind people that I am a good person, that's why I probably have gone into entertainment.\n\n'Hopefully people can relate that life is difficult.'", "description": "Emily Atack looked remarkably fresh-faced for her This Morning appearance on Tuesday, despite confessing she'd had nine drinks at the awards show.", "authors": ["Kate Thomas For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/12/20323486-0-image-a-64_1572351660061.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
