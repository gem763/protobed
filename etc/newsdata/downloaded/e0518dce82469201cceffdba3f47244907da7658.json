I don\u2019t think we should have troops in the Middle East. But we have to do it the right way, the smart way,\u201d Warren said at Tuesday\u2019s Democratic debate. \u201cWe need to get out, but we need to do this through a negotiated solution. There is no military solution in this region.\u201d\u2026\n\nThe spin was worse than the gaffe. Does Warren (or the Warren campaign) not know that the United States\u2019 Al Udeid base in Qatar flies \u201ccombat\u201d missions fighting terrorists, including in Iraq and Syria, all the time? What is a \u201cnon-combat base\u201d anyway? Are the U.S. bases in Iraq, to which our troops in Syria are now withdrawing, combat bases? Does Warren want to remove all U.S. troops from Iraq? The campaign declined to answer any of these questions.\n\nWhat about the larger questions begged by Warren\u2019s position on the Middle East? How is the United States supposed to leave the Middle East \u201cthe right way, the smart way,\u201d without increasing the security risks at home? Since diplomacy and negotiations are not going to work with terrorists, how does Warren propose to deal with that, absent troop deployments? Again, the campaign declined to answer.", "description": "", "authors": ["Josh Rogin", "Washingtonpost.Com Opinions Elizabeth-Warren-Is-Failing-Commander-Chief-Test"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
