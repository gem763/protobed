But asked whether he fears Stokes\u2019 feat may hang over his captaincy in the way that all-rounders Ian Botham and Andrew Flintoff impacted previous Aussie skippers, Paine said his concern was more basic.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

He\u2019s created a number of chances each time he\u2019s bowled to him.\n\n\u201cBut the other side of it is we hold our chances when Nathan is bowling to him. If we can do that, I think he can open the game up for us through that middle order. The last two tests in particular, we\u2019ve let Nathan down a bit with our fielding,\u201d he said.\n\nPaine did however engage in some self-criticism about the way the last test got away from his side.\n\n\u201cWe made some mistakes, it happens. We have addressed it as a team and spoken about it honestly. I was certainly one of those people who made mistakes. I would have done some things differently with my field placings,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere were times, looking back at it, where it was obvious I should have had the field up and allowed Ben to hit a couple of boundaries so we had more balls at the tailender (Jack Leach).\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the main thing I would have done differently. It happens in cricket and we have moved on, learnt from it, and we are ready for another great test match.\u201d\n\nReuters", "description": "It is nine days since Ben Stokes hit a remarkable 135 not out to win the third test of the Ashes series at Headingley, and as he prepares for the next instalment, Australia captain Tim Paine said thoughts of how to outwit the England batsman keep him awake at night.
