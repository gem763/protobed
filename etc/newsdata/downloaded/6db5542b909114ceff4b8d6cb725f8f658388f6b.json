REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski\n\nThe 72-year-old Italian banker is widely credited with saving the euro zone from collapse, but some critics say he also overpowered opponents and tended to front-run the bank\u2019s monetary policy in public.\n\nHis approach fueled discord that spilled into the open, critically weakening the bank\u2019s united front when it was most needed to persuade investors that it was committed to its policies.\n\nMore than a dozen current and former ECB policymakers who spoke to Reuters all agreed that Draghi is a superb central banker who deserves credit for swift action during the euro crisis of 2012, when he single-handedly saved the currency by quashing speculation against the bloc\u2019s most heavily indebted countries.\n\n\u201cDraghi was an inspiring leader at very difficult times,\u201d former Austrian central bank chief Ewald Nowotny told Reuters. \u201cSo this is a bit of a problematic ending to an otherwise very impressive career.\u201d\n\nIn particular, Draghi\u2019s management style sharply escalated tensions by the end of his term, some policymakers said.\n\nThey said further that creating the broadest possible consensus and making sure that the ECB speaks with one voice should be Christine Lagarde\u2019s top priorities after she takes over on Nov. 1.\n\nAssuring investors that the bank\u2019s policies would remain consistent would provide markets with a degree of certainty, they added.\n\n\u201cMario is willing to live with 50% plus one vote,\u201d said one of the policymakers, who asked not to be named. \u201cChristine (Lagarde) needs to change this.\u201d\n\nDraghi and the ECB declined to comment for this story. Lagarde was unavailable for comment. When asked in his last news conference as ECB president last week about the dissent over restarting bond purchases, Draghi said disagreement was unavoidable and the bank has stuck to its mandate of keeping euro zone prices stable.\n\n\u201cUltimately it\u2019s the reality that speaks more strongly than any other voice,\u201d said Draghi. \u201cIt\u2019s the reality together with the conviction that we did what we did always in pursuing our mandate. If anything, that\u2019s a distinctive thing.\u201d\n\nThe most dramatic public schism occurred last month, when the ECB agreed to resume government bond purchases in an effort to kickstart fading economic growth and nudge up inflation to its target of just below 2%.\n\nMore than a third of policymakers objected, the biggest dissent Draghi faced in eight years at the head of an organization that traditionally strives for consensus.\n\nECB board member Sabine Lautenschlaeger quit, having unsuccessfully argued for years that the ECB\u2019s stimulus measures are excessive, possibly even stretching the bank\u2019s mandate. She declined to comment.\n\nThe central bank chiefs of Germany, the Netherlands and Austria, who tend to favor more conservative monetary policy, all rebuked the decision to restart bond purchases, which would increase the ECB\u2019s existing 2.6 trillion euro pile of bonds.\n\nDraghi\u2019s allies say more discussion within the ECB likely would not have changed any outcomes.\n\n\u201cMario Draghi has been fulfilling his obligations very well in very difficult circumstances,\u201d Finnish central bank chief Erkki Liikanen told Reuters. \u201cI give him my support and I\u2019m sure history will show he was right.\u201d\n\nDAMAGING LEAKS\n\nThe public disagreement last month, followed by damaging leaks of confidential staff opinions opposed to restarting the purchase of bonds, set off doubt among investors about the ECB\u2019s commitment to the plan.\n\nMarket-based interest rates have actually risen since the bank\u2019s rate cut in September, as some investors now doubt the bank\u2019s readiness to stick to its plan and cut rates further if necessary.\n\nThe crescendo of doubt forced French central bank chief Francois Villeroy de Galhau, who opposed the restarting of bond purchases, to make the highly unusual move two weeks ago of pledging that the September decision would be carried out in full. He declined comment for this story.\n\nBut the damage was already done.\n\n\u201cThe noisy objections weakened confidence in our resolve, so they actually damaged the policy,\u201d one current policymaker said.\n\nDraghi, a former Goldman Sachs and World Bank executive, already created a minor uproar in June when he stoked expectations for stimulus by tweaking the bank\u2019s policy message in a speech that caught many of his fellow rate-setters off guard, effectively pushing policy deliberations into the open and making compromise difficult.\n\n\u201cWhen one starts communicating before a meeting, others feel pushed into a corner and will want to express themselves,\u201d Belgian central bank chief Pierre Wunsch told Reuters.\n\n\u201cSo, essentially, you have a meeting before the meeting,\u201d said Wunsch, who supported the September stimulus package.\n\nOpponents also took objection to Draghi\u2019s practice of preparing big decisions with a close circle of advisers and involving the ECB Governing Council only late in the process.\n\nFor instance, proposals for the stimulus package were not distributed until the morning of the September meeting, primarily to prevent leaks, but leaving little time for preparation, especially as the final proposal was more ambitious than many had expected.\n\n\u201cIf he (Draghi) sees that he has the votes, the issue is closed and we move on,\u201d one policymaker said. \u201cHe makes little attempt to find a compromise or to engage with Governing Council members who express a different view. It\u2019s a simple vote-counting exercise.\u201d\n\nIn one meeting earlier this year, Dutch central bank chief Klaas Knot confronted Draghi about the ECB\u2019s failure to raise inflation expectations, questioning whether the ECB\u2019s tools were working as intended.\n\nAccording to four people present at the meeting, the testy exchange ended abruptly with Draghi telling Knot not to question a key tenet of modern central banking. The ECB, Draghi and Knot declined to comment on the incident.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Christine Lagarde, President-designate of the European Central Bank talks to ECB's outgoing President Mario Draghi in Frankfurt, Germany October 28, 2019. Boris Roessler/Pool via Reuters\n\nA survey of the bank\u2019s staff by a trade union published last week showed most backed Draghi\u2019s policy but many resented him running the institution through a \u201ckitchen cabinet\u201d or \u201cbrain trust\u201d of loyalists and \u201crailroading through decisions.\u201d\n\nFor Lagarde, the task now is to end the public bickering and either return to decision-making by consensus or keep discord out of the media, some policymakers said.\n\n\u201cChoosing Madame Lagarde was a good decision because obviously what is needed now are diplomatic skills both with dealing inside the ECB and dealing with the governments,\u201d said Nowotny.", "description": "Mario Draghi will leave a more united euro zone when he steps down as president of the European Central Bank this week, but he hands over a body more publicly divided than ever on how best to resurrect an ailing regional economy.", "authors": ["Balazs Koranyi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446084584&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S0BD", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
