Oil pares U.S. stock-draw gains on weak demand outlook\n\nBy Koustav Samanta\n\nSINGAPORE, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Oil prices dipped on Thursday\n\non lingering concerns about a weak demand outlook, after surging\n\nmore than 2% in the previous session on the back of a surprise\n\ndraw in U.S. crude stocks.\n\nBrent crude futures fell 39 cents, or 0.6%, to\n\n$60.78 a barrel by 0111 GMT. The international benchmark crude\n\nrose 2.5% on Wednesday to settle at $61.17 a barrel, levels not\n\nseen since Sept. 30.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures dropped\n\n46 cents, or 0.8%, to $55.51 per barrel. U.S. crude closed 3.3%\n\nhigher in the previous session.\n\nU.S. crude inventories fell 1.7 million barrels in the week\n\nended Oct. 18, compared with analysts' expectations for a 2.2\n\nmillion barrel build, data from the Energy Information\n\nAdministration showed. This was in stark contrast with earlier inventory data\n\nreleased by industry group the American Petroleum Institute\n\n(API), which showed a build of 4.5 million barrels in U.S. crude\n\nstocks. API/S\n\nThe EIA said the drawdown in weekly stocks came as\n\nrefineries hiked crude runs and oil imports fell, which prodded\n\na jump in both benchmark crude grades on Wednesday.\n\n\"Given the unexpected drawdown in this week's report, it is\n\nperhaps unsurprising that the market reaction was positive,\"\n\nKieran Clancy of Capital Economics said in a note.\n\n\"That said, with headwinds facing the U.S. and the global\n\neconomy likely to intensify in the months ahead, it probably\n\nwon't be long before a return of fears over the health of\n\ndemand.\"\n\nSome market participants said a decline in U.S. product\n\ninventories, as shown by the EIA data, could point to underlying\n\ndemand. EIA/S\n\n\"The EIA report may be an indication that oil demand is not\n\nas bad as a current dreary run of global headline macro data\n\nmight suggest,\" said Stephen Innes, market strategist at\n\nAxiTrader.\n\nThe prospects of deeper production cuts by the Organization\n\nof the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies also\n\nhelped support the market.\n\nRussian Energy Minister Alexander Novak, however, said on\n\nWednesday that no formal calls have been made yet to change the\n\ncurrent global oil supply deal. OPEC, Russia and other producers have since January\n\nimplemented a deal to cut oil output by 1.2 million barrels per\n\nday (bpd) until March 2020 to support the market. The producers\n\nwill meet to review the policy on Dec. 5-6.", "description": "Oil pares U.S. stock-draw gains on weak demand outlook", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC3G0FO_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
