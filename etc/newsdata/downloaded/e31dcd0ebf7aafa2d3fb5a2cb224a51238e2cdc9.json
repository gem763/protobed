Each man currently holds a win over the other. In addition to their own potential trilogy, Palmer\u2019s quarterfinal clash with Almeida is also a trilogy fight.\n\n\u201cLike Lance said, man \u2013 it would be two trilogies in one night. You guys are in for something. We\u2019re gonna figure it out.\u201d\n\nHarrison, who lost to Palmer in the 2018 playoff semifinals, said it\u2019s only human to have half a thought on the $1 million prize, but he\u2019s trying to keep his mind on the task at hand.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s $1 million dollars \u2013 who\u2019s not going to think about it?\u201d he said. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to prioritize. (It\u2019s all about) Gilpin right now.\u201d", "description": "Andre Harrison talks to MMA Junkie ahead of the PFL featherweight playoffs at Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas.", "authors": ["Simon Head", "George Garcia", "Dave Doyle", "Mma Junkie Staff", "John Morgan", "Farah Hannoun", "Nolan King"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/off-guard-andre-harrison.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
