Sanders and Buttigieg were the only other candidates to crack double-digits, at 15 percent and 10 percent, respectively.\n\nThe poll is a split from a CNN/SRSS national poll released on Wednesday. In that poll, Biden held a fairly comfortable lead over Warren and Sanders, with the former vice president leading the pack at 34 percent, to Warren's 19 percent and Sanders' 16 percent.\n\nThe qualification deadline for the fifth debate is Nov. 13, a week before the debate night. Details like the venue and format of the debate are yet to be announced.\n\nSo far, nine of the 12 candidates who participated in the most recent Democratic primary debate earlier this month have qualified for the November debate, despite the DNC modestly increasing the threshold to qualify month-over-month. The new thresholds were not expected to drastically cull the number of candidates on stage from the twelve who participated in October, the largest major-party presidential primary debate ever.\n\nThe three candidates on the October debate stage who have yet to qualify for November are former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro. They need to hit three percent in two, three and four more polls, respectively.\n\nThe Quinnipiac University poll was conducted from Oct. 17-21 and surveyed 713 Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic. It has a margin of error of +/- 4.6 percentage points.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/30/ec/40843f314e6eb95007e1752165a8/191024-klobuchar-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
