Cecchini predicted that the market's early 2019 rally would be followed by a steep drop. It hasn't happened yet, and the benchmark S&P 500 index was trading at all-time highs on Monday.\n\n\"When everybody got to 2,800, I got neutral. And then when large-cap equities got to 2,900, I got overtly bearish,\" he told Business Insider in an exclusive interview.\n\nAnd he hasn't changed his time frame much, predicting that the S&P 500 will fall roughly 18% to 2,500 late this year or early in 2020. All around him, he sees \"cracks\" in economically sensitive sectors like transportation \u2014 something that's worrying more than a few experts \u2014 and says that any number of manufacturing indicators point to a recession in that part of the economy.\n\nAs those cracks widen, he thinks stocks will sink to his target level.\n\n\"We think the probability of a recession in the second half of 2020 is relatively high,\" he said. \"Equity markets here in the US should respond sometime in advance of that [by] six to nine months.\"\n\nThe usual response to bad manufacturing results is that most US economic activity comes from consumers and not manufacturers. While measurements like consumer confidence are still high, Cecchini argues that doesn't prove much because consumers typically keep spending until the eve of a downturn.\n\n\"There's really not much room for improvement\" in critical indicators like unemployment or spending, he said. He added consumer spending was being kept afloat now by loose lending standards and that banks were already beginning to get stricter.\n\n\"Lending standards are slowly beginning to tighten across the board,\" he said.\n\nCecchini said he was most pessimistic about transportation and regional bank stocks, the two sectors that are giving off many of the negative readings he's concerned about. His prediction of a market plunge and economic downturn unsurprisingly leads to a defensive recommendation for stocks.\n\n\"Over the next three to six months, I'm relatively more constructive on REITs and utilities,\" he said, singling out commercial-real-estate trusts as particularly promising.\n\nInvestors can get exposure to those sectors through exchange-traded funds such as the Vanguard Real Estate Index Fund ETF and the Utilities Select SPDR Fund ETF.\n\nHe added that investors seeking income would keep buying longer-term Treasurys as rates in Europe and Japan remain ultra-low. While a lot of investors are keeping their fixed-income duration short today, Cecchini is going in the other direction and telling them to go far out on the curve, where rates are higher and not facing as much downward pressure.\n\n\"Rates in the US are likely to tend towards zero over the intermediate to long run,\" he said. \"Relative to an average allocation model right now, we're definitely going to be much more heavily underweight equities and long, long duration.\"", "description": "Peter Cecchini of Cantor Fitzgerald has been 2019's biggest stock-market bear.
