He has manned the phones, answered each of our questions, ensured that we have had a hot cup of coffee or tea, and helped serve us a hot breakfast.\n\n\u201dHe has handled this situation with grace, kindness, and a beautiful smile on his face,\u201d Chandler added.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nSmith, who has been working at the Homewood Suites for about a year, said he first learned his co-worker couldn\u2019t make it in for her night shift at around 7 p.m., according to KIDY.\n\n\"Then the morning came around, and I was the only one there and everyone was expecting breakfast,\" he said.\n\nThe stranded guests offered to help, too, with one volunteering to help him make breakfast while others washed dishes or cleaned the dining area. Amid the storm, some even offered to brave the elements to bring water bottles to stranded truck drivers nearby on the I-10.\n\n\"We also invited some people from other hotels to come eat because they didn\u2019t have any food,\" Smith said, per KIDY, explaining that guests helped him cook dinner that evening, too.\n\nWhen another employee finally came to relieve him from his duties, it was Friday, Sept. 20 \u2014 and Smith celebrated by taking a nap and then returning right back to work.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\n\u201cIf you know Satchel, tell him he is our hero!\u201d Chandler wrote in her Facebook post. \u201cWhat an example of how to handle yourself in a crisis! Goodness gracious!\n\n\u201cI will stay here next time just knowing that despite whatever happens, I will have someone putting our needs above his own needs. Thank you Satchel for taking care of us here at Homewood in Beaumont.\u201d\n\nThe general manager of the hotel has also praised Smith\u2019s actions.\n\n\"I wasn\u2019t sure how he would take a crisis,\" said Alanna Hall, also the operations manager for the hotel, in a statement to USA Today. \"But he has done a wonderful job.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSevere flash flooding caused by Imelda first hit parts of east Texas on Thursday in Houston and the surrounding areas.
