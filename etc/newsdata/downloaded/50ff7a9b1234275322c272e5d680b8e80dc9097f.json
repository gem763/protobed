Cloud\u2019s founder, Gibson Wells, claiming to be the richest man in America, says the place is \u201c \u2018more than a store. . . . It could provide relief to this great nation.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAD\n\nAnd indeed the nation and the world need relief. A financial collapse, no doubt set in motion by Cloud, has come to pass. One small village now consists of a \u201crow of low-slung buildings, old businesses now empty, the signs faded or fallen, the parking lots full of weeds.\u201d Above a superhighway, insects gather in \u201cgreat black swarms moving back and forth across the sky.\u201d In India, there are mass migrations from areas that have fallen below sea level.\n\nAD\n\nFor desperate, displaced Americans, Wells has expanded his warehouses into residences, called MotherClouds; there\u2019s one in every state in the country. In a series of blogs, Wells describes the new society he has created with them. Early on, he struck an agreement with the federal government to take over the FAA. He abolished unions. To keep his residents informed, he created the Cloud News Network. \u201cAnything else,\u201d he insists, \u201cis just fake news.\u201d\n\nIn an eerily prescient moment, Wells threatens to assume even more power and \u201cput this lumbering old beast of government out of its misery,\u201d he writes. \u201cI am the one to do it,\u201d he explains, \u201cbecause I am exceptional.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHordes of Americans are desperate to live and work in Cloud\u2019s apartments, even if accommodations are \u201cmore like a crowded hallway than an apartment.\u201dAt Cloud, residents must wear CloudBands, which monitor and direct their every movement. There are compensations. The CloudBurger, available only on site, is \u201cone of the best and most affordable fast-food burgers in the country.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHart, the author of a series of detective novels, spins out his plot at the biggest Cloud complex in the country, a place that looks as if it had been \u201cdropped from the sky by an uncaring hand.\u201d Here a man and a woman infiltrate the hordes shoving their way in: Paxton, a former prison guard, seethes over losing a patent to Cloud and seeks revenge; Zinnia, on assignment from an unrevealed agency, plans to uncover Cloud\u2019s tax dealings. What the pair learns about Cloud and its management may convince readers to forswear online shopping and buy at any independent local stores they can find.\n\nSet in and around London, Marrs\u2019s \u201cThe Passengers\u201d plays on other near-future fears. This unsettling thriller begins as eight people head off in their driverless cars. They\u2019re scarcely on the way before their vehicles take unplanned turns. \u201cAlternative destination being programmed,\u201d a \u201csoftly spoken female voice\u201d tells them. The doors lock, their windows turn opaque so the drivers can\u2019t motion for help. Then a male voice announces: \u201cFrom here on in, I am in charge of your destination. . . . The only thing you need to know at this point is that in two hours and thirty minutes from now, it is highly likely you will be dead.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn Birmingham, meanwhile, jurors arrive to serve on the Vehicle Inquest Jury, a government panel charged with determining fault in fatal accidents involving autonomous vehicles. They scarcely begin deliberating when the same voice that informed the eight drivers of their fates speaks over jury room speakers. Identifying himself as \u201cthe Hacker,\u201d the man says he devised the hijackings, and he\u2019s broadcasting scenes of the hostages in their cars on TV and on all the major social media sites.\n\nAD\n\nTo bend the jurors to his will, the Hacker reveals he\u2019s amassed myriad details of their private lives: He knows \u201cyour credit card numbers, the call girls you hire, password, bank statements . . . the emails you\u2019ve sent.\u201d In other words, he has your data and plans to broadcast it.\n\nThe Hacker then reveals he\u2019s guiding the cars to a head-on crash; but he makes a deal with the jurors and his worldwide audience: He\u2019ll spare one life, but the jury must pick the survivor. The debate begins.\n\nAD\n\nThis setup suggests a reality TV show with deadly stakes. But Marrs laces his fast-paced tale with delectably mordant satire. The event, a man exclaims, has turned into \u201cthe most hashtagged global event since social media began.\u201d At hijacking sites, onlookers take selfies with the imprisoned drivers.\n\nIn this dark world, though, Marrs finds light. Awaiting their fates, the hostages reflect on their lives. The prisoners respond from their hearts, revealing thoughts and feelings that far surpass anything the Internet has collected about them. We see that technology amasses facts but cannot plumb souls. In the downbeat, despairing worlds of both these thrillers, this upbeat, inspiring theme shines.\n\nGerald Bartell is a freelance writer who lives in Manhattan.\n\nTHE WAREHOUSE\n\nBy Rob Hart\n\nCrown. 368 pp. $27.\n\nTHE PASSENGERS\n\nBy John Marrs\n\nBerkley. 336 pp. $26.\n\nAD", "description": "In two dystopian novels \u2014 \u2018The Warehouse\u2019 and \u2018The Passengers\u2019 \u2014 the near future seems very close indeed", "authors": ["Gerald Bartell"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/VzMO92zVkdx1bBXxpN2ydT3QXrg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RWSGFRXJ5UI6TBOAQWQJRZD3G4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
