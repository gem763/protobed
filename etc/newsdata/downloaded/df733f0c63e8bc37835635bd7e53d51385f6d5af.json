But that was still visible to anyone else looking at the thread. The \u2018hide reply\u2019 option removes the comments from others\u2019 view as well.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t remove them completely \u2013 it puts them behind a small button that can be clicked to reveal the comments the original user had wanted to be hidden.\n\nGiven the diatribes that regularly occur on Twitter, a move to try and censor things may not seem like a bad idea. But, like everything on social media, it can have the effect of a double-edged sword.\n\nTwitter now allows UK users to hide replies to their tweets (Metro/Twitter)\n\nTwitter trialled the feature in Canada, and a recent tweet from Canadian PM Justin Trudeau hid replies that referenced his recent brownface controversy. That\u2019s probably not something that voters would want swept under the rug.\n\nHiding replies to tweets validates a willingness to censor opinions. That\u2019s wrong. Especially in Canada, the political elite drive distorted or false narratives to promote themselves. Concerned citizens must be able to object in a public forum. The media won\u2019t do it. WE have to. \u2014 Concrete Mayor (@concretemayor) July 19, 2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow the feature has made its way to the UK and can be used by anyone wanting to hide replies.\n\n\u2018As long as it hasn\u2019t been deleted and/or is not from an account with protected Tweets, everyone can still interact with a hidden reply by clicking the icon to view,\u2019 Twitter said in a statement posted as a series of tweets earlier this year.\n\n\u2018We want everyone on Twitter to have healthy conversations, and we\u2019re working on features that will help people feel more comfortable. We\u2019re testing a way for people to hide replies they feel are irrelevant or offensive.\u2019", "description": "It can be used to control a conversation", "authors": ["Jeff Parsons"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SEI_44802348-84f5_1570626591.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
