Lagarde was in the audience for the speech.\n\n\"As someone who grew up behind the Iron Curtain, I could never have expected to lead the IMF,\" Georgieva said. She noted she had witnessed the devastation of bad economic policies when her mother lost 98% of her life savings during a period of hyperinflation in the 1990s in Bulgaria.\n\nShe said the world was in the midst of a slowdown with nearly 90% of the global economy experiencing weaker growth this year. The IMF this week projected that growth would only reach 3% this year, the weakest performance in a decade.\n\nThe IMF and World Bank meetings were expected to be dominated by the trade disputes triggered by the Trump administration's get-tough policies aimed at lowering America's huge trade deficits and boosting U.S. manufacturing jobs. So far those efforts have made little headway.\n\nIn addition to the battle between the United States and China, higher U.S. tariffs went into effect Friday on $7.5 billion in European goods coming into the United States in a dispute involving airplane subsidies.\n\nFrance's finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said China probably would be the real winner in the U.S.-EU trade fight. He said the EU was ready to negotiate a settlement to avoid the tariffs but so far the U.S. has rejected those efforts.\n\n\"From the very beginning, we have made it very clear that we want to avoid a trade war,\" Le Maire said. \"The response from the U.S. administration has always been a closed door.\"\n\nGeorgieva said Thursday a tentative U.S.-China trade agreement announced last week should lessen the damage slightly, but solid global growth would not return until the two countries resolved their differences.\n\nShe said she hoped this week's talks would focus on ways to ease trade tensions and begin the groundwork to update the rules of world trade. The Trump administration has repeatedly attacked the Geneva-based World Trade Organization, saying it is biased against the United States.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.
