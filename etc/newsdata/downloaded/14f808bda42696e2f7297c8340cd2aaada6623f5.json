We have a couple of people who came knocking \u2014 we said, \u2018don\u2019t knock.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Trump angered Capitol Hill leaders by withdrawing dozens of American troops from a buffer zone between Turkey and Syria ahead of an Ankara-ordered incursion on Kurdish fighters this month.\n\nThe Kurds helped the U.S. rout the Islamic State in the region, but Mr. Trump said he didn\u2019t want a shooting war with Turkey \u2014 a NATO ally \u2014 and that he wants to bring troops home.\n\nEven so, Mr. Trump is shifting troops to Iraq or toward Syrian oil fields, to ensure that Islamic State fighters do not profit from fossil fuels and reemerge as a regional force.\n\nThe president is bringing up the oil supply with increasing frequency.\n\n\u201cOil is secured. Our soldiers have left and are leaving Syria for other places, then COMING HOME!\u201d he tweeted Friday. \u201cWhen these pundit fools who have called the Middle East wrong for 20 years ask what we are getting out of the deal, I simply say, THE OIL, AND WE ARE BRINGING OUR SOLDIERS BACK HOME, ISIS SECURED!\u201d\n\nCongressional Democrats say they\u2019re uneasy with an emerging Pentagon plan to deploy armored vehicles to the oil fields.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper \u201csays we are sending armored vehicles to defend the oil fields, not just special forces,\u201d Sen. Brian Schatz, Hawaii Democrat, said on Twitter. \u201cThis may be the first time we\u2019ve deployed anything other than special forces to Syria. Tanks are obviously less nimble than special forces, so they are more at risk to enemy forces.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s fixation on securing Middle East oil stretches back to at least 2011, when he tweeted frequently about the situation under President Obama.\n\n\u201cWhen will our nation\u2019s sacrifices be respectfully appreciated? Iraq and Libya should reimburse us in oil,\u201d he tweeted in October 2011.\n\nIn March 2012, he wrote: \u201cWe should have gotten more of the oil in Syria, and we should have gotten more of the oil in Iraq. Dumb leaders.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
