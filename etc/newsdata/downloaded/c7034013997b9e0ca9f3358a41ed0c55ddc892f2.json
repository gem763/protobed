It was a story which had disturbing echoes of the killing of James Bulger in 1993. Like the killers in that case, Marcus Hopewood had eventually resumed life under a new identity (now called Daryl) and in a different location. He\u2019d been married, had a daughter and was now divorced but without his family having any knowledge of his horrific former life.\n\nWhen his daughter Jessie (Adrianna Bertola) had an accident and Hopewood (who was known then as Daryl) was filmed rescuing her, the footage went online and he was recognised. We saw the shock of the hospital staff when they realised who their patient was. The script didn\u2019t dwell on the details of the original crime but we found out that the attack had been vicious and prolonged. Robyn was particularly troubled that the victim had been a little girl. As the mother of a little girl herself, she couldn\u2019t bring herself to go near Hopewood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDylan was immediately concerned that vigilantes would track the killer down to Holby (as a Holby ambulance was seen in the online footage). That turned out to be exactly what happened, but the twist was that the vigilante was Lorna (Michelle Collins), the mother of the murdered child, who\u2019d got herself admitted to the hospital so she could get revenge.\n\nJessie\u2019s world turned upside down (Picture: BBC)\n\nOne of the most troubling aspects of the story was the realisation by Hopewood\u2019s daughter Jessie that the father she knew and loved had done this awful crime. She tried to talk to him when he refused treatment for the brain aneurysm that could kill him, and found herself in danger when Lorna held a knife to her throat. In tense scenes we learned about Hopewood\u2019s other crimes against children, while Duffy tried to reason with Lorna and get her to put the knife down. Thanks to Duffy\u2019s intervention Lorna realised that she couldn\u2019t put a mother through the pain she\u2019d been through by killing Jessie, and the girl was reunited with her mother at the end.\n\nSue Haasler is the author of the official Holby City book, which you can read about here.
