Gavin Newsom (D) on Friday signed 15 gun control bills into law, which expands the Golden State's already stringent gun laws, the Los Angeles Times reported. Newsom has made a name for himself because of his calls for stricter gun laws, specifically surrounding an assault weapons ban, high capacity magazine ban and the implementation of Extreme Risk Protection Orders (ERPOs), commonly referred to as red flag laws. He said the state decided to take up these bills because of Washington's inaction, a clear reference to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's (R-KY) refusal to take up bills he knows President Donald Trump refuses to sign into law.\n\n\u201cThis continues California\u2019s leadership in terms of gun safety,\u201d Newsom said at a state Capitol bill-signing ceremony. \u201cGun violence is an epidemic in this country, one that\u2019s been inflamed by the inaction of politicians in Washington.\"\n\nAccording to Cam Edwards at Bearing Arms, here's what the bills do:\n\n\u2022 Californians can only purchase one semi-automatic rifle per month.\n\n\u2022 Bans the sale of semi-automatic centerfire rifles for anyone under 21.\n\n\u2022 Gives teachers, school administrators, employers and co-workers the ability to petition the court to have a person's firearms confiscated through the red flag process.\n\n\u2022 Expands the length of time an ERPO remains in effect from one year to five years.\n\n\u2022 Bans gun shows from taking place at the Del Mar Fairgrounds (because it's owned by the state).\n\n\u2022 Eliminates that's currently in place for \"processing\" concealed carry permit applications. Right now, the max a county can charge is $100 per application.\n\n\u2022 Requires \"precursor parts\" (like 80 percent lowers for AR-15s, triggers, or even barrels) to be sent to a licensed \u201cprecursor parts dealer,\" where a background check is conducted and a fee is paid. Newsom believes this will help eliminate \"ghost guns.\"\n\nMost of the bills will go into effect on January 1. The exception is the expanded red flag laws, which go into effect September 1, 2020.\n\nNewsom took to Twitter to promote the \"gun safety\" bills he signed into law.\n\nTune in as we sign 15 bills \u2014 including those focused on tackling the issue of ghost guns and strengthening our gun violence restraining orders and red flag laws \u2014 to help prevent gun violence in CA. https://t.co/37XXJNAsrD \u2014 Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom) October 11, 2019\n\nStill remember Gilroy. El Paso. Las Vegas. Sandy Hook. The list goes on.\n\n\n\nStill remember the lives lost and the silence from @senatemajldr. No action, no compassion, no remorse.\n\n\n\nSo we acted.https://t.co/QIncj633WU \u2014 Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom) October 12, 2019\n\nWhat Newsom is doing is typical of anti-gunners. They want to have the ability to say they support the Second Amendment. Instead of outright attempting to ban firearms, they make it virtually impossible. They put long waiting periods in place, in hopes that people get frustrated and eventually decide gun ownership isn't \"worth the hassle.\" They make it extremely expensive so people can't afford it. And guess who suffers the most in that case? Inner city minorities. They can't afford to pay the fees associated with the training, the transfer fees, the concealed carry permit and then wait until the state deems them worthy of ownership.", "description": "Just what we need. .10/12/2019 20:17:00PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2016/132/b05e078a-67b1-44a2-b38e-462c2b185693.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
