On the one hand, the transcript is not verbatim, the White House\u2019s cloak-and-dagger handling of records of the call betrays concern about its contents, and there are indications of elisions in the document that was released. On the other hand, the transcript that was released is incriminating enough to cast doubt on the claim that the administration was trying to hide things.\n\nDavid A. Graham: Trump\u2019s incriminating conversation with the Ukrainian president\n\nThe White House didn\u2019t violate standard procedure for releasing transcripts of calls with foreign leaders; there is no standard procedure, because it\u2019s effectively unprecedented. But a whistle-blower complaint referred to \u201cthe official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced\u2014as is customary\u2014by the White House Situation Room,\u201d suggesting that a verbatim transcript does exist. The complaint also noted that records of the call were closely guarded and kept out of circulation, a claim that has been substantiated by reporting since.\n\nIn three places in the transcript, an ellipsis (a series of three dots) is used. That\u2019s typically a marking that indicates where part of a conversation has been removed. The White House says the ellipses represent places where the speaker trailed off or paused, but current and former officials told The Washington Post that standard practice in such situations is to use dashes or \u201c[inaudible]\u201d in such cases.\n\nEach of the three ellipses comes when Trump is lapsing into unproven conspiracy theories\u2014the first two during a discussion of whether Russian hacking in the 2016 election was really a Ukrainian false flag, and the third when asking about his unsubstantiated accusations of wrongdoing by the Biden family. This makes the prospect of elisions in these key areas all the more important and tantalizing. Yet it is also imaginable that Trump veered into incoherence, as he sometimes does, leaving the notetakers befuddled or unable to reconstruct his words.\n\nMany observers have noted that even though the whistle-blower was not on the call, the account that he or she offered aligns with the actual transcript, imparting credibility. It\u2019s worth noting that the White House was aware of the complaint before releasing the transcript, though, and could have tailored its document to include only what was in the whistle-blower\u2019s account.\n\nSkeptics of the released transcript have also noted a discrepancy between the reported length of the call and the length of the transcript, especially in comparison with transcripts of calls with two other foreign leaders that were leaked in 2017. Trump and Zelensky spoke through interpreters, which could affect the length, but it\u2019s not clear whether interpretation was simultaneous or not.", "description": "There are enough questions and inconsistencies to wonder whether the public version tells the whole story.", "authors": ["David A.
