Summa co-founder, James Prestwich, told the news outlet:\n\n\u201cConnecting to other chains doesn\u2019t seem to be an Ethereum developer\u2019s priority, but other chains seem to want to connect to Ethereum.\u201d\n\nDevelopers all over the world have been working on interoperability solutions to enable different networks to interact more efficiently in an attempt to eradicate existing issues in regard to scalability and speed.\n\nIn that regard, Josh Swihart, VP of marketing and business development at Electric Coin Company, said that the Zcash community will develop a wrapped ZEC token that can be used on the Ethereum blockchain network, adding:\n\n\u201cIf you want to do lending, if you want to do DAOs [decentralized autonomous organizations], all of that stuff could be done with Zcash as well \u2026 Ultimately, we want Zcash shielded [addresses] to be usable in Ethereum smart contracts.\u201d\n\nWhen asked why decentralized app creators might want shielded address and smart contract options, Zcash Foundation board member Ian Miers said:\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be the kid at Chuck E. Cheese where everyone knows you have all the tokens.\u201d\n\nZcash gets delisted on Upbit and OKEx\n\nCointelegraph previously reported that South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Upbit was ceasing trading support for six cryptocurrencies, including Zcash. The exchange clarified that the reason for delisting these six privacy coins is to block the possibility of money laundering and the inflow from external networks.\n\nJust days before, OKEx Korea confirmed it would halt trading of Zcash and other privacy-focused coins. The exchange said that the coins fall foul of new guidelines set out by the intergovernmental body the Financial Action Task Force.", "description": "Privacy-focused coin Zcash is showing interest in accessing Ethereum\u2019s decentralized finance ecosystem", "authors": ["Joeri Cant"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvNGIyNjJhZWJkYWEyZTNmODRhOTRkNTkyODFhYjBmZWEuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
