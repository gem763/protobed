The report also provides a number of strategies to improve public safety throughout beaches across the Outer Cape-area.\n\n\u201cWith so many stakeholders with varied interests, it was essential that we reviewed our options carefully and scientifically. The alternatives analysis provided us a research-based, unbiased review of options so that we would have a clear understanding of which options could be suitable for our Outer Cape beaches,\u201d said Rae Ann Palmer, Truro Town Manager. \u201cThose options included any adverse impacts to the environment or to the humans recreating in our waters; and most importantly\u2014the effectiveness of preventing a shark/human interaction. It is very important to us to use research and science-based decision making that allows us to best protect the public\u2019s safety, trust and tax dollars.\u201d\n\n\"The Outer Cape Shark Mitigation Alternatives Analysis, consolidates ideas, available technologies, and current strategies for shark mitigation and will provide invaluable information for future shark management decisions,\u201d Superintendent of the Cape Cod National Seashore Brian Carlstrom said in a Town of Truro press release on Wednesday.\n\nThe report divided the shark\u2019s migration strategies into three separate categories, the first being technology-based, the second barrier-based, and the third being biological-based, with strategies including tagging, acoustic detection, magnetic, culling, contraception, barriers, visual detection, adaptive camouflage as well as modifying behavior and scent smell.\n\nEach category and strategy have varying degrees of potential success. According to report findings, visual detection carries a very low rate of success, as once a shark has come into one\u2019s view, the shark will already be far too close to swimming areas.\n\nTagging efforts only offers minor insight into sharks\u2019 movements, as only a small portion of the shark population is tagged. Officials say an expanded tagging program may help inform safer human behavior by greatly expanding the sample size sharks.\n\nOther results from Wednesday\u2019s report reveal that buoys do play a role in improving public safety in terms of shark presence and migration, but their deployment does not necessarily mean swimmers are safe from sharks. Meanwhile, sonar detection systems have not yet lived up to their potential, and no technology-based alternatives have been able to successfuly separate sharks from humans.\n\nThe report did stress however that the most important finding following the recent shark migration is that no one alternative, or even any combination of alternatives, will assure potential swimmers\u2019 safety, with wearable protection, repellant and camouflage proving inconclusive in preventing a shark attack.\n\nThe report highlighted that modifying human behavior is likely the most effective form of shark attack prevention, with the best way to for swimmers to minimize the risk of a shark-related attack or fatality is for beachgoers to change their behavior during the peak shark activity season.\n\nAny strategy in question will not be employed until a regional consensus determines the best action going forward, with the Woods Hole Group suggesting a continued effort to expand education and outreach between beaches, town officials and the residents who live there.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\n\u201cThe Woods Hole Group report is the first step in making an informed decision on the Town of Wellfleet's actions regarding shark mitigation,\u201d said Dan Hoort, Wellfleet Town Administrator. \u201cWe know that humans need to modify their behavior when in the presence of this apex predator. Now we begin to determine if there are additional strategies that may be effectively employed to reduce the possible human interaction with a shark.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince its inception, The Atlantic White Shark Conservancy has been committed to supporting research on white sharks in this region and sharing that information with public safety officials, beach managers and the general public to help enhance public safety. We will remain steadfastly dedicated to this mission,\u201d Chief Executive Officer, Atlantic White Shark Conservancy Cynthia Wigren said in Wednesday\u2019s press release.\n\nCLICK TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nSharks are protected by state and federal law, meaning indiginous hunting, contraception and species culling is not permitted.
