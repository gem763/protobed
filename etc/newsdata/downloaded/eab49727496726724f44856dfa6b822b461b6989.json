For more information, see our ethics policy .\n\nSmart home security systems can be pricey, but Best Buy is hosting a good deal on SimpliSafe\u2019s 11-piece system, our top pick among popular do-it-yourself home security systems. Usually priced at $369.99, it\u2019s currently $269.99 as part of the retailer\u2019s deal of the day promotion.\n\nThis kit configuration is exclusive to Best Buy, and unlike the 12-piece set sold on Amazon for $499, this one doesn\u2019t include a camera or a panic button. It does offer a base, keypad, two motion sensors, a key fob, and six window or door sensors.\n\nSimpliSafe\u2019s system is easy to set up and the sensors included are discreet. In short, with this deal at Best Buy, it\u2019s more affordable to get a recommended, comprehensive setup to secure your home.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the mood for more deals, Sony\u2019s DualShock 4 wireless controller is cheaper than usual at Amazon: it\u2019s currently $43.99, down from its usual price of $59.99. But what makes this deal worth mentioning is that it comes with some Fortnite in-game items, including the Neo Versa bundle, which contains PlayStation-specific cosmetics and 500 V-Bucks, the paid currency for the game.\n\niOS 13 is due to be released September 19th, and will bring official support for the DualShock 4 controller to iPads, iPhones, and the Apple TV. So this is a good time to snag one if you\u2019re hoping to easily play games on Apple Arcade, which will launch alongside iOS 13.\n\nSpeaking of iPhones, the iPhone 11, 11 Pro, and 11 Pro Max are all available for preorder right now. You can pre-purchase one through Apple, Best Buy, or your carrier of choice, and if you have a phone to trade in, you\u2019ll be able to save some money.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft is offering excellent trade-in values for iPhones and recent Android devices if you use that credit toward buying a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.\n\nYou can get up to $650 for phones in the iPhone X lineup: the iPhone X, XR, XS, and XS Max. Other recent devices like Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S10, the Note 9, and the Google Pixel 3 can fetch as much as $650 in trade-in credit, as well. This promo expires on September 22nd, and it\u2019s an in-store exclusive, so head to your local Microsoft Store with your old phone to see how much you can get for it.", "description": "Best Buy\u2019s deal of the day includes the SimpliSafe home security system.
