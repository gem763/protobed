Lindsey O. Graham\u2019s (R-S.C.) \u201cno quid pro quo outside the July 25 call.\u201d Under any reasonable definition of \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d asking Ukraine to come up with dirt on former vice president Joe Biden to influence our election is an impeachable offense, but now Trump enablers are insisting on an ever-higher bar and exclusion of evidence we already have (the July 25 transcript) in order to rule out impeachment.\n\nThis tactic gives his base and his Fox News mouthpieces new arguments against impeachment, but for anyone not already in the tank for him, it is highly problematic. There is replete evidence of what Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) describes in her \u201cfact sheet\u201d as the shakedown (the quid pro quo sketched out by Trump himself), the pressure campaign (holding up aid) and the coverup (obstruction in hiding controversial phone call transcripts and preventing witnesses from testifying and providing documents). Moreover, there is evidence that Trump is now dangerous (i.e., the Syria withdrawal and release of Islamic State fighters) and creating new grounds for impeachment (e.g., Doral for the Group of Seven conference).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt is the steady stream of new revelations, stupid admissions from the White House and testimony behind closed doors from witnesses with direct knowledge of events that have paralyzed many Republicans, who fear looking ridiculous advocating defenses that cannot be sustained for more than a few days \u2014 or, in some cases, hours.\n\nThis unpredictability leaves an increasing number of Republicans hedging their bets.\n\n[M]any Republicans coalesced around this defense of Trump regarding that July phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president: It was inappropriate but not impeachable. According to a Washington Post analysis of their comments, no Senate Republicans support an impeachment inquiry in the House \u2014 not even the vocal Sen. Mitt Romney (Utah) \u2014 but at least 15 have expressed concerns or say they have questions about what Trump did. The rest, 38, support Trump unequivocally. It\u2019s a big step from \u201cinappropriate\u201d to \u201cimpeachable,\u201d but it is a step on the same path.\n\nWithout knowing what other evidence is out there, or what the White House will confess to next, Republicans are loath to stake out a new standard for impeachment only to see it surpassed by a shameless president convinced his wrongdoing is not wrong at all.\n\nAD\n\nMurmurs from some Republicans, and utter silence from a great many more, have set off Trump\u2019s paranoia. Convinced they might turn on him (and who is to say that fear is not justified?) or fail to push back against the mound of evidence Democrats are assembling (with what argument?), he lashes out at the very people he needs the most.\n\nAD\n\nThe Post reports, \u201cPresident Trump urged his party to \u2018get tougher and fight.\u2019\u201d Accusing them of being \u201cvicious and [sticking] together\u201d (seriously, these are compliments in his mind), he wants undivided loyalty on his side. However, lashing out only leads to ineffective stunts like trying to censure House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) but does nothing to buck up nervous Republican senators. Indeed, when he goes off on crackpot theories (\u201cMaybe the informant was Schiff\u201d) or doubles down on bad facts, Republicans must cringe. (\u201cTrump reiterated his contention that his July phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was a \u2018perfect call.\u2019 That call was the one in which Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate the Bidens at a time when nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine was being withheld.\u201d Not so perfect, then.)\n\nRepublican lawmakers are learning what Trump\u2019s lawyers figured out long ago: Trump is a legal nightmare, his own worst witness. As his non-Ukraine conduct worsens (e.g., Doral, Syria), Republicans edge ever so slightly toward the inflection point where Trump becomes more political trouble for them than he\u2019s worth.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Trump is right to be worried", "authors": ["Jennifer Rubin", "Opinion Writer Covering Politics", "Policy", "Foreign", "Opinion Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/QknCyvjey69eeT0-I-jqKu9CpBo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/M7Q5L2XUGQI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
