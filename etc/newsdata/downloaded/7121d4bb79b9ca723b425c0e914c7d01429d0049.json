I am going to go through the entire roster like a chainsaw through butter.\"\n\nThe Irishman says the January bout will be just the start of his season, with plans to fight the winner of Nate Diaz versus Jorge Masvidal at UFC 244 and then the winner of Nurmagomedov and Tony Ferguson.\n\nConor McGregor announces at a press conference in Moscow this AM that he has agreed to return to action on Jan. 18 in. T-Mobile. He did not name the opponent. Fight isn't signed. Two leading candidates are Cerrone and Gaethje. Cerrone is the frontrunner at this time, I'm told. \u2014 Ariel Helwani (@arielhelwani) October 24, 2019\n\nAfter describing a rematch with Nurmagomedov as \"inevitable,\" the former two-time UFC champion had some strong words for the Russian.\n\n\"The people of Russia deserve this rematch to take place here in Moscow,\" McGregor said.\n\n\"And it will happen. However, I am not waiting around for that man. That man is a known pull-out, a known fearer of risk.\n\n\"He is afraid of the Moscow bout for whatever reason. He's running from the fight in Russia. The public want it. The people want it. His own father wants it. He's afraid of risk. A man who fears risk will conquer nothing long-lasting. There will be no longevity in his career.\n\n\"Where is he now in this country? I fly in, he flies out. Typical.\"\n\nMcGregor and his son, Conor, attend Super Bowl LIII between the New England Patriots and the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nAlthough he's not competed in the UFC in over a year, McGregor hasn't struggled to make the headlines, often for the wrong reasons.\n\nA video released on social media in August appeared to show the Irishman punching a man in the head in the Marble Arch pub in Dublin.", "description": "Conor McGregor says he will make his long-awaited comeback to UFC on January 18, 2020.", "authors": ["Ben Morse", "For Cnn"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191024122054-conor-mcgregor-khabib-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
