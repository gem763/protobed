The radar can then spot an aircraft by \u2018reading how the signals bounce off\u2019 of the jet (stock photo)\n\nFollowing the jets' take-off, the firm activated the radar, began tracking the jets and collected data using signals from the planes.\n\nStealth technology has provided fighter jets with the ability to elude radar defenses and the US has poured hundreds of billions of dollars into studying and developing aircraft with this capability,\n\nHowever, it seems they may be returning to the drawing board after following the news that two of their F-35 fighter jets were tracked by a German firm, first reported by C4ISRNet.\n\nThe technology is designed to observe electromagnetic emissions in the atmosphere, which includes such signals from radio stations, televisions, cellphone towers and more.\n\nThe radar can then spot an aircraft by \u2018reading how the signals bounce off\u2019 of the jet.\n\nIt was reported that the two US Air Force F-35As were at the Berlin Air Show in 2018 where the data was captured.\n\nThe technology found the jets and tracked them for approximately 93 miles.\n\nHowever, C4ISRNet also noted that the German company knew when the jets were coming and were able to use the signals from the jets\u2019 ADS-B transponders to help identify the craft.\n\nSo although this may sounds troublesome for those flying into battle, real enemies will not know when these fighter jets are coming \u2013 so they may not be able to detect them without this knowledge.\n\nF-35 fact file: How the jets cost $100m each, fly at a maximum speed of 1,200mph and include more than 300,000 different parts \u2013 The jet measures 51.2ft in overall length, has a wingspan of 35ft and a height of 14.3ft. \u2013 It has a top speed of 1.6 Mach or 1,200 mph, a Max G rating of 7G, and a combat radius of 518 miles. \u2013 Lockheed Martin, who built the jet, describes its stealth capabilities as 'unprecedented'. Its airframe design, advanced materials and other features make it 'virtually undetectable to enemy radar'. There are three different varieties of the F35, which each have separate features, as show above \u2013 The F-35B jets are built from more than 300,000 individual parts. \u2013 There are six distributed aperture system sensors around the jet \u2013 two underneath, two on top of the aircraft and one either side of the nose. These infrared cameras feed real-time information and images into the pilot's helmet, allowing them to see through the airframe. \u2013 All variants of the jets are mainly constructed on Lockheed Martin's mile-long production line in Fort Worth, Texas. \u2013 It takes 58,000 man hours to build each F-35B. \u2013 The F-35 can launch from land, and will take off from HMS Queen Elizabeth via the skip jump ramp, which has been designed to optimize the launch. \u2013 Maximum thrust tops 40,000lb and the jet has a range of 900 nautical miles. \u2013 The jet is capable of two types of ship landing \u2013 vertically on to the deck, and also through the shipborne rolling vertical landing, which using forward air speed, allows the aircraft to bring back several thousand pounds of extra weight to the ship.\n\nAnother issue is that the radar's ability to spot the jets relies on signals from civilian transmitters, and many war zones are wastelands with not a civilian in sight.\n\nWith this being known, nations with a stealth craft could easily take out cell phone networks through cyberattacks or bomb radio broadcasting towers to keep their fighter jets hidden.\n\nHowever, TwInvis is the only one of its kind that has successfully tracked an F-35, and from 93 miles away.\n\n'As the radar develops and operators refine their tactics, it could become even more effective,' Popular Mechanics reported.", "description": "A German radar makers claims to have tracked two US F-35 fighter jets at a pony farm in Berlin for nearly 100 miles using a system equip with 'an emerging generation' of sensors and processors'.", "authors": ["Stacy Liberatore For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/30/21/19124678-0-image-a-55_1569876699533.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
