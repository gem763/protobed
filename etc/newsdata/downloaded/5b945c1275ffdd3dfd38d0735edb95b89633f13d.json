Each Friday, The Verge\u2019s Cut the Crap column simplifies the choice by sorting through the overwhelming multitude of movies and TV shows on subscription services and recommending a single perfect thing to watch this weekend.\n\nWhat to watch\n\nElection, a 1999 political satire directed by Alexander Payne and co-written by Payne and Jim Taylor, adapting Tom Perrotta\u2019s novel of the same name. Set in an Omaha, Nebraska high school, the film stars Reese Witherspoon as Tracy Flick, an energetic overachiever who irritates her smugly idealistic history teacher Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick) with her aggressive self-promotion.\n\n\u201cMr. M\u201d sees Tracy as emblematic of a strain of prissy privilege, deleterious to the great American experiment. Chris Klein plays affable, dim jock Paul Metzler, whom McAllister encourages to enter the race for class president against Flick. Jessica Campbell plays Paul\u2019s lesbian sister Tammy, who becomes the spoiler. Election examines the simmering desperation of one middle-aged Middle American teacher, while also commenting on how even the least important political campaigns can devolve into shallow posturing and mudslinging.\n\nWhy watch now?\n\nBecause the Election-esque series The Politician is now available on Netflix.\n\nCo-created by Glee producers Ian Brennan, Brad Falchuk, and Ryan Murphy \u2014 a team that\u2019s worked in various combinations on the TV series Scream Queens, American Horror Story, American Crime Story, Pose, Popular, and Nip/Tuck, among others \u2014 The Politician stars Tony-winning Broadway actor Ben Blatt as Payton Hobart, an upper-class Santa Barbara teen hoping to use a high school election as a springboard toward his larger political goals. Gwyneth Paltrow plays Payton\u2019s doting mother Georgina, while Zoey Deutch is Infinity Jackson, a sickly classmate Payton names as his running mate, to court a sympathy vote.\n\nThe Politician is the first project Ryan Murphy has produced under a lucrative multiyear deal with Netflix. Before the first season even went into production, it had been greenlit for season 2. On the continuum of Murphy\u2019s shows, The Politician has more in common with Scream Queens and Glee than Pose or American Crime Story. The series comments on the superficiality of modern politics, but in a way that\u2019s colorful and cartoonish, with a broadly comic take on privilege and popularity, not bogged down by wonky real-world details.\n\nElection isn\u2019t exactly a docudrama either, but while its characters are also comical (and rooted in stereotypes), the movie is predominantly about the daily grind of middle-class existence. Payne and Taylor let each of their main characters tell their part of the story via overlapping narration to illustrate the distance between their self-image and their actual behavior and also to mitigate the bitter undertones of McAllister and Flick\u2019s voices with the relative sweetness of the Metzler siblings.\n\nThis story, though, is mainly about Mr. M, who teaches the same tedious facts every year, then goes home to his wife\u2019s bland dinners and his secret stash of pornography. McAllister has a lot of options about morality and ethics, but his firmly held convictions don\u2019t keep him from inviting his wife\u2019s best friend to sleep with him \u2014 and at an American Family Inn, no less. Payne and Taylor are simultaneously empathetic toward and critical of a man who overestimates his own importance, interfering with a meaningless election in hopes of saving the world from Tracy Flick.\n\nBroderick gives a wonderfully nebbishy performance, and the filmmakers do a fine job of using visual cues to define the smallness of his world \u2014 like the recurring image of his automatic seat belt, slowly wrapping tightly around his body every time he gets into his car.\n\nWho it\u2019s for\n\nPolitical junkies and Reese Witherspoon fans.\n\nEvery week, Noel Murray\u2019s Cut the Crap column recommends a single film or show to stream and provides a pocket education on one director, subgenre, movement, or moment in pop culture history. From evil doll movies to alternate-reality stories to Game of Thrones pre-history, the extensive Cut the Crap archives will teach you new things about culture\u2019s past while cutting through the mountain of new releases to find one relevant thing that\u2019s worth watching.\n\nWitherspoon had a strong start to her career, giving a handful of well-received performances when she was still in her teens and early 20s. Election showed off her knack for comedy and for playing larger-than-life, often unapologetically brash characters. Her ferocious Tracy (whose printed last name, \u201cFLICK,\u201d looks pointedly rude in certain typefaces) is a lonely soul with a megalomaniacal bent, for whom the American education system is less about accumulating knowledge and more about running up the score on her transcript.\n\nPayne and Taylor, meanwhile, have fun mocking the drudgery of high school and the pointlessness of high school elections. Mr. M imagines the ritual as an exercise in democracy: it\u2019s the freedom to choose between apples and oranges, he says, as he draws both fruits on a chalkboard as featureless circles. When Paul then astutely notes that his fondness for either apples or oranges varies depending on the day, that\u2019s a funny, pointed metaphor for the fickleness of the American electorate.\n\nWhere to see it\n\nTubi and Vudu are both currently streaming Election for free (with commercials). It\u2019s also worth seeking out Payne and Taylor\u2019s 1996 debut feature, Citizen Ruth, which satirizes the abortion debate via the story of a wastrel (hilariously played by Laura Dern) who becomes a national cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre after she gets pregnant. It\u2019s not available through any of the subscription or ad-supported streaming services, but most digital retailers offer it to rent or buy.", "description": "The new Netflix series The Politician \u2014 from Ryan Murphy and his partners on Glee, Scream Queens, American Horror Story, American Crime Story, Pose, Nip/Tuck, and more \u2014 tracks an ambitious schemer through the cynical world of high school politics. It\u2019s an echo of Alexander Payne\u2019s brilliant movie Election, starring Reese Witherspoon and based on Tom Perrotta\u2019s novel.", "authors": ["Noel Murray", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gUXTWssxNvfuzA9WpbKeJLwIb4A=/0x39:1983x1077/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19236992/Election.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
