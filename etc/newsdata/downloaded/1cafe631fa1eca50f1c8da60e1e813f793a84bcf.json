By NFL rule, all players are supposed to be available to media after games.\n\nBut no other players that we know of are currently being sued for three incidents of sexual assault, including forcible rape, against a former trainer.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAnd on Monday, a story by Sports Illustrated revealed a new accusation of sexual misconduct by Brown and also offered details of multiple incidents of the receiver stiffing part-time employees on payment and being flat-out disrespectful in the process.\n\nArtist: Brown approached her naked, bailed on auction payment\n\nSI reporter Robert Klemko has a nearly 5,000-word story that posted on Monday; Klemko writes that he spoke with more than two dozen individuals, \u201cpeople who have employed, worked for, coached, or played alongside Brown \u2014 some who have taken legal action against him, and others who have not \u2014 and reviewed police and court documents from jurisdictions ranging from Miami to Pittsburgh to Oakland\u201d for the story.\n\nThe overall picture is one of a man who has little, if any, respect for those he asks to do work for him, is rarely held accountable and believes social media posts are the same as money.\n\nA new Sports Illustrated story details the many ways in which Antonio Brown mistreats those who enter his orbit. (AP)\n\nThe most damning allegation is one made by an artist whom Brown hired in 2017.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe woman, who asked to remain anonymous, had painted a portrait of Brown that was sold at an auction tied to a charity softball game in Pittsburgh that Brown had agree to host in June 2017; the game and auction benefitted the National Youth Foundation.\n\nBrown noticed both the portrait and the artist, who was in her late 20s; one of the co-founders of the National Youth Organization, Sophia Hanson, said he topped the would-be winning bid of $450 with an offer of $700 to buy it for himself.\n\nHe told Hanson he\u2019d pay for the artwork at a later date, and she took him at his word.\n\nHe also invited the artist to come to his 8,800-square foot home in the suburbs north of Pittsburgh to create another painting of him, this time a mural. He agreed to a daily fee of $1,000 for her work and sent a van to transport her and some of his friends and associates from New York City to the Pittsburgh area.\n\nThe woman, who spoke about the alleged incident for the first time after being contacted by Sports Illustrated, said Brown began flirting with her but at first she thought nothing of it, as that type of behavior was something she dealt with often.\n\nWhen Brown posted a live video of her progress on social media, the artist was thrilled.\n\n\u201cIt was very exciting, to have this person interested in my work,\u201d she said. \u201cHe acted like he trusted me and he let me do my thing.\u201d\n\nBut on just her second day, things got more than uncomfortable.\n\nThe woman said at one point she was in a kneeling position while painting and turned to find Brown standing behind her. He was naked save for a small towel he was holding over his genitals.\n\n\u201cHe was flirty with me but I paid him no mind because I was there on business, plus, I had already seen him with multiple girls in the short time I was with him,\u201d the woman said. \u201cI was about 40 percent done on the second day, and I\u2019m on my knees painting the bottom [of the mural], and he walks up to me butt-ass naked, with a hand cloth covering his [penis] and starts having a conversation with me. \u201cUnfortunately, I\u2019ve been tried [by men] a lot of times, so I just kept my cool and kept painting. After that, it all ended abruptly.\u201d\n\nThe next day, Brown told her he was headed to his native Miami. She still believed she would finish the mural when he returned, but weeks passed with no contact from him, and his various assistants stopped responding to her text messages as well.\n\nBrown did pay her $2,000 for two days of work. She is not pursuing charges or renumeration, but was bothered by his behavior. She told SI that friends whom she\u2019d told about the incident with Brown contacted her last week after news of the lawsuit that had been filed against him.\n\nDarren Heitner, a Brown attorney, tweeted on Monday after the SI story posted that Brown reviewed the allegations and \u201cdenies he ever engaged in such activities.\u201d\n\nBrown also hasn\u2019t paid National Youth Foundation the $700 he pledged for the original portrait he bought at the charity auction despite messages and emails sent to Brown and agent Drew Rosenhaus.\n\nFarting and empty promises\n\nOther alleged incidents involving Brown are disrespectful.\n\nDr. Victor Prisk, who runs Prisk Orthopaedics and Wellness (POW) in Monroeville, Pennsylvania, said Brown\u2019s reputation preceded him, but he took a meeting with Brown in August 2018 despite what he\u2019d heard about the then-Steelers player.\n\nAs Prisk was measuring Brown\u2019s body fat, Brown audibly passed gas several times. Someone with Brown was recording the appointment \u2014 which Prisk says Brown was three hours late for \u2014 and he looks at the camera and smiles as he\u2019s passing gas; the video, not surprisingly, made its way to TMZ.\n\n\u201cIt just seemed childish to me,\u201d Prisk told Sports Illustrated. \u201cI\u2019m a doctor and this man is farting in my face.\u201d\n\nBut Prisk agreed to take Brown on as a client, creating diets and a supplement program and acting as his on-call \u201cwellness coach.\u201d The two verbally agreed that Prisk would be paid $500 an hour, but whenever Prisk bought up payment, Brown seemed reluctant.\n\nInstead, he\u2019d make proclamations about he and Prisk becoming business partners.\n\n\u201cIn his very first meeting with me he said, \u2018I want to get you on salary, I want you on my team,\u2019\u201d Prisk said. \u201cThen he\u2019s like, \u2018We need to build this downtown. POW 2!\u2019 I\u2019m like, O.K., that\u2019s cool. Found a building, had somebody put together a sales agreement for the building. Don\u2019t hear anything back. Then he says, \u2018I\u2019m going to connect you with a treadmill company I work with. We\u2019re gonna get you a couple treadmills for your gym.\u2019 AB stops talking to that guy and then I\u2019m told they\u2019re not giving me a treadmill.\u201d\n\nPrisk\u2019s story has become a familiar pattern.\n\n\u201cHe tells you he\u2019s going to make it totally worth your while,\u201d Prisk said. \u201cHe\u2019s gonna invest in your business, invest in you. You\u2019re part of my family. Call God and all that. But he doesn\u2019t do that, and he doesn\u2019t even pay the bill.\u201d\n\nPrisk filed suit in Pennsylvania this month seeking $11,500 from Brown; the suit is pending.\n\nEven though Brown\u2019s tenure as a member of the Oakland Raiders lasted less than six months, he is accused of stiffing someone he worked with there as well \u2014 trainer Sean Pena, whom Brown flew to Northern California for one week of training, is suing him for $7,200 in unpaid wages.\n\nPolice called on three consecutive days\n\nThe SI story says that police were called to Brown\u2019s Pittsburgh-area home three times in the last four years, and each time his girlfriend, Chelsie Kyriss, was involved. Brown and Kyriss have three children together.\n\nNone of those calls resulted in an arrest.\n\nAccording to police in Hollywood, Florida, on Jan. 17 of this year Wiltrice Jackson, who has a daughter with Brown, and the receiver had a domestic dispute over reimbursement for their daughter\u2019s hair appointment.\n\nBrown refused to let Jackson into his home, a loud argument ensued, and Brown allegedly pushed Jackson to the ground; she suffered a cut on her arm. Hollywood Police say Jackson did not want to press charges.\n\nAccording to police in Sunny Isles, Florida, officers were called to Brown\u2019s home on three straight days in April 2018.\n\nOn April 23, Brown called police to report that he\u2019d returned from a trip to find that a handgun and bag containing $80,000 had been stolen from a closet in his apartment.\n\nThe next day, police returned after a call that Brown was throwing furniture from the balcony of his 14th-floor residence; officers reported Brown was \u201cvery agitated.\u201d (The family of a toddler who was almost struck by the falling furniture sued Brown and the two sides settled in April.)\n\nThen on April 25, Brown called police again, this time saying his Rolls-Royce had been stolen. When police arrived at his address, Brown opened the door and said, \u201cI found the car,\u201d and closed the door.\n\nThe next month, May 2018, Brown was back in Pittsburgh and called police, claiming a safe containing $50,000 in cash and $2 million worth of jewelry had been stolen from his bedroom.\n\nBrown tried to pin it on Sam Williams, a former personal assistant he said was the only person who would have had access to his home. Police said Williams passed a polygraph test, and interviews with Williams and at least one other person revealed several people had access to Brown\u2019s house.\n\nWilliams, not surprisingly, told police Brown owed him back wages.\n\nChef told \u2018You don\u2019t look him in the eye\u2019\n\nOne of the more recent incidents involving Brown that was told to SI came from Stefano Tedeschi, who is known as \u201cChef Stef\u201d around central Florida.\n\nTedeschi said he was hired early this year to work at the Orlando-area mansion Brown rented during Pro Bowl week. Like Prisk, Tedeschi had heard of Brown\u2019s negative reputation, but after Tedeschi\u2019s friend, former Steelers linebacker Larry Foote called Brown and told him to treat the chef well, he took the job.\n\nBrown asked Tedeschi if he\u2019d be willing to cook for a party with 40-50 other Pro Bowlers; Tedeschi told him he would charge Brown per person for the meal.\n\n\u201cHe came up and asked me and he was very sweet about it,\u201d Tedeschi said, recalling that Brown told him, \u201cI\u2019m not worried about money. That\u2019s not an issue, you know that.\u201d\n\nThe chef and his staff made a spread of antipasti, cocktail shrimp and beef tenderloin. Brown was thrilled and promised to talk up Tedeschi on his social media channels.\n\nTedeschi says throughout the week, as other service people came in and out of the rented home, he heard Brown say more than once, \u201cGet those mother [expletive] crackers out of here,\u201d and that his wife heard him call women at the various gatherings \u201c[expletive] b----.\u201d\n\n(You\u2019ll recall there was a report that Brown also called Raiders general manager Mike Mayock \u201ca cracker\u201d during an argument. An antiquated term, it\u2019s generally but rarely used by black people as a pejorative against white people.)\n\nThe chef says Brown\u2019s children were present.\n\nThe next day, one of Brown\u2019s assistants told him, \u201cWhen you speak to Mr. Brown you don\u2019t look him in the eye.\u201d Brown was looking on, and the assistant began yelling, \u201cWhen you speak to Mr. Brown you don\u2019t look him in the eye!\u201d\n\nLater that day, Brown found a salmon head in the freezer; Tedeschi said it was intended for a soup, but Brown took it as some kind of mafia-style threat on his life.\n\nHe refused to pay the $38,521 owed to Tedeschi, who initially didn\u2019t want to file a civil lawsuit, saying he tried to smooth things over with Brown, aware a suit against a celebrity could hurt his business. But he filed suit last month.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "More details of Brown's misdeeds.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/LTWhn5Z4px9XqukYsAbyPQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3rh9hWyz5AHe9Xkh1mGJ7Q--~B/aD0zNDU2O3c9NTE4NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/45c28150-d8c6-11e9-bcff-c8b9c609314b", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
