Katie Hill (D-CA) had an inappropriate \u201csexual relationship\u201d with a congressional staffer, according to a statement released Wednesday.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, the committee wrote, \u201cThe Committee is aware of public allegations that Representative Katie Hill may have engaged in a sexual relationship with an individual on her congressional staff, in violation of House Rule XXIII, clause 18 (a)\u201d:\n\nNEW \u2026 ETHICS COMMITTEE is probing whether @KatieHill4CA was involved \u201csexually\u201d with her staffer. She has denied the allegation. pic.twitter.com/YpPVUOLqFK \u2014 Jake Sherman (@JakeSherman) October 23, 2019\n\nAllegations surfaced this week in a report from RedState, which provided pictures and texts purportedly proving that Hill was in a \u201cthrouple\u201d relationship with her now-estranged husband Kenny Heslep and a female staffer. According to the report, Hill broke off the alleged relationship with both her husband and the staffer after moving to D.C. and allegedly went on to have an affair with Graham Kelly, who is now her legislative director.\n\nAs previously reported:\n\nAccording to RedState, the three \u2014 Hill, Heslep, and the young female staffer \u2014 \u201ctook multiple vacations together, including to Alaska, where this photograph was taken.\u201d The image referenced allegedly shows a censored image of Hill brushing the staffer\u2019s hair in the nude. Other images allegedly show Hill and the staffer kissing. According to RedState, the \u201cthrouple\u2019s\u201d relationship changed once Hill moved to D.C., and Hill \u201cbroke off her relationships with both Heslep and the staffer, claiming she wanted to focus on \u2018this important work\u2019 and that it wasn\u2019t fair to be involved in a relationship.\u201d The outlet shared screenshots of text messages allegedly between Hill and the staffer, who was \u201cdistraught and trying to figure out how to move on with her life.\u201d In one text, the staffer asks Hill if she ended their relationship due to the \u201cpolitical risk.\u201d \u201cNo. I mean I guess maybe partially. Honestly, though, it\u2019s that I want to be alone,\u201d Hill allegedly replied. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be accountable to anyone else. I want to be entirely focused on this work that I think is so important.\u201d \u201cAnd that\u2019s not fair to anyone as a partner,\u201d the text reads. \u201cRedState was also provided with intimate photographs of the women, which we have chosen not to publish,\u201d the outlet added.\n\nRedState emphasized Hill\u2019s role on the Oversight and Reform and Armed Services committees as reasons for the publication of her alleged relationships, citing national security concerns.\n\nHill has denied the allegations.\n\n\u201cThe fact is I am going through a divorce from an abusive husband who seems determined to try to humiliate me,\u201d Hill told Politico, calling the allegations a \u201ccoordinated effort to try to destroy me and people close to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am disgusted that my opponents would seek to exploit such a private matter for political gain. This coordinated effort to try to destroy me and people close to me is despicable and will not succeed,\u201d she continued.\n\n\u201cI, like many women who have faced attacks like this before, am stronger than those who want me to be afraid,\u201d she added.\n\nHill has reportedly reached out to Democrat leadership \u2013 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) \u2013 to \u201cdeny the allegations,\u201d Politico\u2019s John Bresnahan and Heather Caygle reported.", "description": "The House Ethics Committee has formally launched an investigation into whether Kati Hill had a \"sexual relationship\" with a staffer.", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Katie-Hill-in-Jeans-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
