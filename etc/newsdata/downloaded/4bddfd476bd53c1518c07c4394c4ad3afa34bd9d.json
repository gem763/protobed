Bernie Sanders (I-VT) got over 25,000 people to show up in support of his campaign at an event in Queens on Saturday, Trump was preoccupied with two entirely different ex-presidential contenders from 2016 and a current one polling in the low single digits.\n\n\u201cSo now Crooked Hillary is at it again! She is calling Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard \u2018a Russian favorite,\u2019 and Jill Stein \u2018a Russian asset.\u2019 As you may have heard, I was called a big Russia lover also (actually, I do like Russian people. I like all people!). Hillary\u2019s gone Crazy!\u201d the president tweeted.\n\nTrump was referring to a back-and-forth that erupted between Clinton allies and Gabbard, over apparent allegations that the former Democratic presidential nominee views the Hawaii congresswoman is a favorite of the Russian government. In addition, Stein, who previously launched a third-party bid, was criticized by some Clinton loyalists to have helped sway the election in the president\u2019s favor.\n\nBut as Trump fixated on Clinton and stayed silent on Sanders over the weekend, some Republicans were eyeing the force behind his rally\u2014where he was introduced by his most coveted endorser yet, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY)\u2014with fresh attention.\n\nJoe Biden Turns on Bernie Sanders After Hammering Elizabeth Warren\n\n\u201cAnyone who counted out Bernie Sanders is going to be wrong,\u201d former 2016 Trump campaign adviser Michael Caputo told The Daily Beast. \u201cI see Bernie as far more formidable now than he ever was. With the endorsements from the freshman congresswomen, I think it brings a new life back into his campaign,\u201d Caputo said, referencing both Ocasio-Cortez and Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), who also endorsed Sanders.\n\nCaputo, a veteran Republican and pro-Trump campaign operative, sees many similarities between the Trump voters of 2016 and potential Trump or Sanders voters of 2020. With much of the presidential primary buzz centered around former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), he said it\u2019s Sanders\u2019 message that most closely aligns with swing voters, particularly in the Rust Belt, who went for Trump.\n\n\u201cWe see the support for socialism and for progressive values going up every year. Bernie Sanders brought that brand of politics to the presidential level,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019d have to be pretty overconfident not to see the challenge he creates not just for Donald Trump but for the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nThe Queens rally was a must-show of force for Team Sanders. In the days leading up to the event, and following the fourth Democratic debate in Ohio, the campaign sent out emails and social media blasts in hopes of generating the kind of momentum that would be enhanced by Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s presence. In a fundraising email they called her one of \u201cthe great political phenomenons in modern American history.\u201d\n\nSome Democratic operatives unaffiliated with any campaign publicly acknowledged the endorsement. Brian Fallon, who served as Clinton\u2019s national press secretary in 2016, wrote on Twitter \u201cfew endorsements actually matter in campaigns. But this one does.\u201d\n\nSure enough, the optics boost followed on Saturday, where Sanders beat the approximately 20,000 people that showed up at Warren\u2019s September rally in Manhattan\u2019s Washington Square Park, as well as Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019 (D-CA) campaign kickoff in Oakland, California in January.\n\n\u201cWhen I look at this huge crowd, brothers and sisters, I have no doubt that the political revolution is going to sweep this country, sweep Donald Trump out of office and bring the change that this country has long needed,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nWhen asked about what Saturday\u2019s showing could mean for the campaign, veteran Republican strategist Doug Heye told The Daily Beast \u201cyou can\u2019t argue with the crowd size.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut crowd sizes alone don\u2019t win primaries and caucuses,\u201d he continued.\n\nHeye acknowledged a strong physical emergence for Sanders, but also pointed indirectly to Warren as a formidable opponent in the Democratic primary.\n\n\u201cThe Sanders campaign still needs to demonstrate what states they can win, especially when that means beating a candidate positioning herself as sort of a \u2018Bernie-lite,\u2019\u201d he said, without referencing the Massachusetts senator by name.", "description": "Bastiaan Slabbers/NurPhoto via GettyFor a man obsessed with crowd size, President Trump has been eerily silent about a rally that\u2019s the largest yet by a rival running to take him on in the 2020 election.\u00a0\u00a0On the same day that Sen.
