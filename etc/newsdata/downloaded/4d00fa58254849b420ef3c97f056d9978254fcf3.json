So I had no real appreciation for just how hard other guys were racing. Now that I can see it, I really do just admire how talented these guys are and how hard they go after it and I try to embrace that. And then when I see anything happen on the racetrack, man, I just try to react naturally to it as if I was hanging out on the couch with my friends.\u201d\n\nBut coming across as casual wasn\u2019t always easy when the 26-time NASCAR Cup Series winner was a rookie broadcaster.\n\n\u201cI think the toughest part for me was just getting over the nerves,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re just so nervous that you\u2019re going to make a mistake. You\u2019re talking to a lot of people and a lot of people are very critical about the broadcasts and hold the broadcast team to a certain standard. When I was a race car driver, I thought the broadcast team had a very heavy obligation and so when I got in that role I\u2019m like \u2018Well, okay, I\u2019ve been talking the talk, now I\u2019ve got to walk the walk.\u2019 I\u2019ve always felt like the broadcasters had an important job to do and now I\u2019m doing it so I take it extremely seriously. So I was extremely nervous. Once you can shed those nerves, you really can be yourself.\u201d\n\nWhen you get a brisket man, it is a two-day process \u2026 It\u2019s very similar to preparing a race car\n\nWorking for NBC has also allowed Earnhardt to enjoy perks he couldn\u2019t take advantage of when he was driving.\n\n\u201cI think I enjoy going to all the races more as a broadcaster because I\u2019m out from under that performance pressure that I had to perform and succeed and win,\u201d Earnhardt says. \u201cNow that I don\u2019t have that I\u2019m going to these races and really enjoying the festivities and the atmosphere and taking it in as a fan. I\u2019m getting to enjoy a lot more of the perks and explore places away from the racetrack that I wouldn\u2019t have before. When you go out to Sonoma, the wineries and all the amazing restaurants they have there. When we go out to Kansas and places like that the barbecue is amazing.\u201d\n\nAnd barbecue is a subject Earnhardt, who refers to himself as an aspiring BBQ pitmaster in his Twitter bio, is trying to learn as much about as he knows about racing. Interestingly enough, he even sees some parallels between the two.\n\n\u201cMaking barbecue reminds me a lot in some ways about racing,\u201d Earnhardt says. \u201cThere\u2019s that tailgate atmosphere and the overnight preparation. You know when you get a brisket man, it is a two-day process. You\u2019ve got to get that thing in a tray of whatever mix you want and have it sitting overnight marinating and you\u2019ve got to inject it \u2026 You might as well have a whole damn toolbox to get it ready. It\u2019s very similar to preparing a race car. And then you get to share it with so many people. And if it\u2019s good you, make a lot of people happy.\u201d\n\nBut, as with a race involving a 15-car pileup, barbecue doesn\u2019t always turn out good.\n\nDale Earnhardt Jr. grills steaks. (Sarah Glenn/Getty for Texas Motor Speedway)\n\n\u201cThe damn thing doesn\u2019t always come out the way that you want it to,\u201d Earnhardt says. \u201cIt\u2019s tough. You don\u2019t always win. Sometimes the smoker maybe doesn\u2019t perform the way you expect it and the heat\u2019s just not the way it needs to be or you don\u2019t get enough smoke on it. There are a lot of variables that are both in and out of your control. It\u2019s so similar to racing and preparing a car and then getting through the event to the finish line.\u201d\n\nSo what make of meat has Earnhardt had the most success with thus far?\n\n\u201cBrisket is pretty much my favorite thing to make,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel like that\u2019s what I\u2019m most consistent with. My favorite thing to eat is ribs, but I think for me ribs is probably the most challenging thing, at least for now. It\u2019s hit or miss on ribs for me. I\u2019m having the most difficulty getting consistency with ribs, but brisket is an easy go-to for me.\u201d\n\nAside from ribs, there\u2019s another type of barbecue Earnhardt is aspiring to take to the finish line before his time as a pitmaster gets the checkered flag.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never done a whole hog. That\u2019s a long way out there for me,\u201d he says. \u201cI think you need to try to cook each individual area and part of the pig before you try to do the whole thing. You really need to understand. Because even though you\u2019re cooking a whole pig, it\u2019s not a linear experience for the entire thing. You\u2019ve got to have the ribs a certain way and so forth. There\u2019s a lot for me to learn there. I think the ultimate accomplishment is for any kind of aspiring barbecue guy would be to cook a whole hog. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever do that because that\u2019s like the hardest shit I can imagine.\u201d", "description": "Earnhardt, who now works as a TV broadcaster for NBC Sports, refers to himself as aspiring BBQ pitmaster so we asked him about it.", "authors": ["Evan Bleier"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-865142152-e1568833534175.jpg?fit=637%2C424", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
