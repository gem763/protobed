Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Thursday morning.\n\nBig day of negotiations with China. They want to make a deal, but do I? I meet with the Vice Premier tomorrow at The White House. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 10, 2019\n\nThe talks appeared to be in jeopardy after The South China Morning Post reported that little had come from deputy-level talks earlier in the week, and that higher-level talks involving Hehad been reduced to Thursday only.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut stocks rebounded after the White House said it was not aware of any schedule changes. A senior administration official told CNBC that Hewas still slated to leave Washington on Friday evening after two days of deliberations.\n\nLate Wednesday, Bloomberg News reported that the Trump administration was considering suspending next week\u2019s scheduled tariff increase in exchange for a currency pact with China. For now, starting Oct. 15, the U.S. plans to raise levies to 30 percent from 25 percent on about $250 billion of Chinese imports. More duties are slated to take effect in mid-December.\n\nMeanwhile, ongoing protests in Hong Kong have cast a shadow on the trade negotiations. China has lashed out at Western businesses \u2014 from Tiffany & Co. to video-game giant Blizzard Entertainment \u2014 in a fierce attempt to quell support for the pro-democracy protests. The National Basketball Association found itself at the center of the tensions after the general manager for the Houston Rockets tweeted in support of the protests on Sunday. The NBA later put out a statement saying it recognized that the tweet \u201coffended so many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump declined to criticize China for pressuring the NBA to renounce a large executive\u2019s support for the demonstrations. But Trump also chastised league coaches Steve Kerr and Gregg Popovich, who have been critical of Trump in the past. Trump accused the coaches of \u201cpandering to China.\u201d Trump added that the coaches \u201ctalk badly about the United States, but when it [comes to] China they don\u2019t want to say anything bad.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Apple on Wednesday said it would remove an app that was used by Hong Kong protesters to track police. Apple said it learned the app had been \u201cused in ways that endanger law enforcement and residents\u201d in Hong Kong.\n\nBut the app\u2019s developers said there had been no evidence that the app had been used in a way that threatened public safety. The developers said Apple had made \u201ca political decision to suppress freedom.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAsked about the negotiations on Wednesday, Trump said he thought a deal was in reach but that any resolution must be better for the U.S. than for China.\n\n\u201cThis has to be a better deal from our standpoint. I think they fully understand it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think China has a lot of respect for me, for our country, for what we are doing. I think they can\u2019t believe what they have gotten away with for so long.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "", "authors": ["Rachel Siegel", "National Business Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/xDc5fkRHDF1niTihypK3cBlwkxM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YZFFLCXJ34I6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
