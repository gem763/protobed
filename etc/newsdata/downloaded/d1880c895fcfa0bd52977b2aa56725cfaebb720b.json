We're doing steps and everything.\"\n\n(Image: BBC/Ray Burmiston)\n\nHe said that Emma is \"really super to spend time with in the studio because she really does love the dancing\".\n\n\"She's lovely to dance with\", he added.\n\nHe explained that her dancing skills made things different to his previous dance partners, and he does not have to worry about simplifying routines.\n\nHe said: \"It's really lovely from my perspective, because I can talk to her like a proper dancer as opposed to sort of a sort of student beginner.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n\"She's doing tremendously well.\"\n\nChris asked: \"How far do you think you can get, realistically?\"\n\n\"Honestly, I think she can go all the way\", replied Anton.\n\n\"I do because I think she's amazing. I think she is tremendous.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nChris asked cheekily: \"Can YOU go all the way!?\"\n\nAnton joked: \"I will take the inhaler and I'll be fine.\n\n\"Lie down in the afternoons.\"\n\nLast week, judge Craig Revel Horwood cruelly told Emma she looked like \"a sack of potatoes\" during her Paso Doble routine.\n\n(Image: BBC/Guy Levy)\n\nEmma's Eastenders co star Kellie Shirley told Christine Lampard on Lorraine: \"I think [the judges] were hard on her this weekend.\"\n\nShe pointed out that Emma was also juggling filming the soap with the gruelling dance rehearsals.\n\nAnton also revealed what his and Emma's Strictly costumes for Halloween night would be.\n\n\"We are playing King and Queens\", he said.\n\n(Image: BBC/Ray Burmiston)\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n\"She is the Queen of Hearts and I'm the King of Clubs.\"\n\nAnton also gushed about his two-year-old twins, George and Henrietta.\n\n\"It's the most wonderful, brilliant thing\", he said.\n\nHe added: \"If I honestly if I was younger and wealthier I'd have 50, I'd have hundreds of them.\n\n\"I love it.
