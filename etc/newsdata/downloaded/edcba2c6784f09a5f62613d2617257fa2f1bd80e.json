He died later at a local hospital, The Daily Beast and The Telegraph reported.\n\nShe had been in the country for two weeks at the time, The Daily Beast reported. The US and UK drive on different sides of the road.\n\nNorthamptonshire Police has not yet responded to Insider's request for confirmation regarding details of the crash and Dunn's death, and how long Anne Sacoolas has been in the UK at the time.\n\nSacolas initially complied with police shortly after the collision and said she had no plans to leave the UK in the near future, Northamptonshire Police said last week. However, she and her family have since returned home to the US after claiming diplomatic immunity.\n\nSacoolas and her family \u2014 including three children \u2014 were privately flown out of a military air base in the UK shortly after the crash, The Telegraph reported.

Jonathan Ernst/Reuters\n\nDunn's death and Sacoolas' departure have since been escalated to the highest echelons of US and UK government. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday publicly urged Sacoolas to return to the UK to face questioning.\n\nUK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab also discussed the issue with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday.\n\n\"If we can't resolve it, then of course I will be raising it myself, personally, with the White House,\" Johnson said.\n\nDunn's parents have also appealed for Sacoolas to return to the UK to face questioning. They have set up a GoFundMe campaign to raise \u00a310,000 ($12,327) and vowed to set up a legal campaign to prevent people from claiming diplomatic immunity in such circumstances.\n\nStephens, the lawyer, told the BBC \"Breakfast\" program on Wednesday that Dunn's parents should travel to the US to sue Sacoolas.\n\nThe British government \"should actually be funding the family\" to sue Sacoolas in the US \"so they can get the explanation they so richly deserve,\" he told Sky News.\n\n\"I cannot believe how badly the Dunn family have been treated,\" Stephens tweeted. \"Lacking humanity and common decency.\"", "description": "Anne Sacoolas is suspected of fatally hitting 19-year-old Harry Dunn with her car in Northamptonshire, England, in late August.", "authors": ["Alexandra Ma"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9b067a695b5824192d311b?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
