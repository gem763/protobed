And America says that I will lift the sanctions,\" Rouhani said. \"It was up for debate what sanctions will be lifted and they had said clearly that we will lift all sanctions.\"\n\nHe added: \"But this action wasn't in a manner that was acceptable, meaning that in the atmosphere of sanctions and the existence of sanctions and the toxic atmosphere of maximum pressure, even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in the 5+1 framework, no one can predict what the end and result of this negotiation will be.\"\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

That characterisation of that money is false, however, as the sanctions merely lifted sanctions that prohibited Iran from accessing money that was already owned by Iran.\n\nThe suggestion that the US would lift sanctions to engage in talks with Iran followed soon after a different international crisis, when Saudi Arabian oil facilities were bombed using missiles that the US and others say came from Iran.", "description": "Donald Trump has denied offering to\u00a0remove all sanctions against Iran in exchange for talks, which Iranian president\u00a0Hassan Rouhani\u00a0had claimed following his attendance at the United Nations General Assembly this week.", "authors": ["Clark Mindock"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/27/09/trump-iran-sanctions.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
