The exact opposite has played out and Rodriguez is throwing a diverse arsenal at Stephens. 10-9 Rodriguez. \u2014 Aaron Bronsteter (@aaronbronsteter) October 19, 2019\n\nHeathen is drilled to the body n he wilts. Yair jumps on his and unloads a storm of punches #UFCBoston \u2014 Sherdog by Mandatory (@sherdogdotcom) October 19, 2019\n\nIf nothing else, Jeremy Stephens is one tough cookie. \u2014 Andreas Hale (@AndreasHale) October 19, 2019\n\nGreat job again by Kevin MacDonald there. #UFCBoston \u2014 Se\u00e1n Sheehan (@SeanSheehanBA) October 19, 2019\n\nThis ref is def pro Stephens \u2014 Belal Muhammad (@bullyb170) October 19, 2019\n\nHOLY SHIT Stephens is back on his feet!
