Owning a strong business and reinvesting the dividends is widely seen as an attractive way of growing your wealth. On the other hand, investors have been known to buy a stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.\n\nAPN Convenience Retail REIT yields a solid 6.1%, although it has only been paying for two years. A high yield probably looks enticing, but investors are likely wondering about the short payment history. Some simple research can reduce the risk of buying APN Convenience Retail REIT for its dividend - read on to learn more.\n\nExplore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on APN Convenience Retail REIT!\n\nASX:AQR Historical Dividend Yield, October 7th 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Comparing dividend payments to a company's net profit after tax is a simple way of reality-checking whether a dividend is sustainable. In the last year, APN Convenience Retail REIT paid out 96% of its profit as dividends. Paying out a majority of its earnings limits the amount that can be reinvested in the business. This may indicate a commitment to paying a dividend, or a dearth of investment opportunities.\n\nAnother important check we do is to see if the free cash flow generated is sufficient to pay the dividend. APN Convenience Retail REIT paid out 99% of its cash flow last year. This may be sustainable but it does not leave much of a buffer for unexpected circumstances. It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.\n\nREITs like APN Convenience Retail REIT often have different rules governing their distributions, so a higher payout ratio on its own is not unusual.\n\nConsider getting our latest analysis on APN Convenience Retail REIT's financial position here.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nFrom the perspective of an income investor who wants to earn dividends for many years, there is not much point buying a stock if its dividend is regularly cut or is not reliable. The dividend has not fluctuated much, but with a relatively short payment history, we can't be sure this is sustainable across a full market cycle. During the past two-year period, the first annual payment was AU$0.20 in 2017, compared to AU$0.22 last year. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 5.7% a year over that time.\n\nThe dividend has been growing at a reasonable rate, which we like. We're conscious though that one of the best ways to detect a multi-decade consistent dividend-payer, is to watch a company pay dividends for 20 years - a distinction APN Convenience Retail REIT has not achieved yet.\n\nDividend Growth Potential\n\nDividend payments have been consistent over the past few years, but we should always check if earnings per share (EPS) are growing, as this will help maintain the purchasing power of the dividend. APN Convenience Retail REIT has grown its EPS 38% over the past 12 months. It's good to see earnings per share rising, but one year is too short a period to get excited about. Were this trend to continue, we'd be interested. A majority of profits are being paid out as dividends, which raises the question of what happens to the current dividend if earnings decline. However, the rapid growth in earnings may indicate that is less of a risk. We do note though, one year is too short a time to be drawing strong conclusions about a company's future prospects.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Today we'll take a closer look at APN Convenience Retail REIT (ASX:AQR) from a dividend investor's perspective.
