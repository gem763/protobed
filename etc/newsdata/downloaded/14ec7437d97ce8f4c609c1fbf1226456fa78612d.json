The flights will carry around 50 passengers and crew, with researchers from the Cooperative Research Centre for Alertness, Safety and Productivity (Alertness CRC) and Sydney University\u2019s Charles Perkins Centre studying the impacts.\n\nAlertness CRC Project Leader Dr Tracey Sletten is one of the researchers who will be boarding the flight.\n\nSletten told Business Insider Australia that the Alertness CRC researchers will be looking at the amount of sleep the flight and cabin crew get leading up to the flight and how much sleep they\u2019re able to get on the flight.\n\nThey will also assess the pilots\u2019 alertness levels.\n\n\u201cWe [will] ask them at different points throughout the flight, how they\u2019re feeling,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd also we [will] do several assessments of their performance. They\u2019re doing some simple reaction time tests at different times that we know is very sensitive to sleep and sleep loss.\n\n\u201cAnd then we are doing some simulated operational tasks as well with a lot of videos inside the flight deck so we\u2019re able to observe how they\u2019re going throughout the flight.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not just about how alert the pilots are, the researchers will be looking at fatigue, stress and comfort levels as well.\n\n\u201cWe [are] also asking them about their workload and stress,\u201d Sletten continued. \u201cWe ask some simple questions around stress and pain, for example, and discomfort at different points. We ask them around the comfort of the sleeping facilities that they\u2019re in so through that process, we might pick up some general concerns around comfort and stress.\u201d\n\nFour pilots will be involved in the study, taking turns to handle the flight. \u201cThey\u2019re all on the flight deck for takeoff and landing, but during the cruise phase of the flight, they actually form two pairs and they rotate their sleep throughout the flight.\u201d\n\nThe key is sleep\n\nOne of the biggest factors the researchers will be looking into is the impact on sleep.\n\nSletten said they will be looking at how long someone has been awake, how much sleep they\u2019ve had and their biological timing \u2013 \u201cwhat time it is according to their body clock compared to when they\u2019re awake\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe interaction of the three of those we know has a huge impact on their alertness at different points,\u201d Sletten said. \u201cAnd so with a longer flight \u2013 normally a longer period of duty \u2013 you might be at increased risks of sleepiness.\u201d\n\nWhile Sletten said that they we would generally anticipate that the longer the flight, the more sleepy someone would get, that isn\u2019t necessarily the case.\n\n\u201cJust because a flight is longer doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re going to be feeling more sleepy at the end of it,\u201d she said. Sletten mentioned other factors that could come into play such as the time of day in which they land.\n\nAnd speaking of sleep, how does one plan on combating jetlag? According to Sletten, it\u2019s about trying to sleep in Australian time.\n\n\u201cOne of the questions that we always ask when someone is taking a trip like this is how long they going to be in their location for. So, in the case of flying from from Australia to New York, for example, if a crew is only going to be away for two days before they turn around and return again, it\u2019s probably best that they try to actually stay on Australia time.\u201d\n\nSletten said trying to sleep as much as possible on the Australian time is \u201cquite often very effective\u201d in making someone more alert.\n\n\u201cSo it may mean that they don\u2019t have as good a quality of sleep at night time but if they\u2019re able to supplement that with a nap during the day that is timed to be aligned with the Australian night time, they can actually help to supplement their sleep,\u201d she said.\n\nThe impact of long haul flights\n\nChrystal Zhang, Associate Professor Aviation, School of Engineering at RMIT University highlighted how commercial flights have evolved over the last century and how people\u2019s awareness of wellbeing in relation to flying has increased.\n\nZhang, who has worked for the Civil Aviation Administration of China, aviation consultancy firms and has expertise in air travellers\u2019 behaviour, mentioned the possible impact of being in a constrained space for long period of time \u2014 such as a flight \u2014 could have an impact on your mindset or your mood.\n\nAccording to the BBC, an emerging body of research suggests that flying 10km above the ground inside a plane can alter our mood.\n\nAnd long haul flights could even lead to greater risks of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), the ABC reported, where a blood clot forms in the veins of a leg and can cause swelling and inflammation. In the report, Monash University Professor Karlheinz Peter highlighted that flights longer than 12 hours can particularly heighten the risk of DVT and many people don\u2019t realise how often it happens.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite scary numbers,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis [where there are no obvious signs], there are studies showing it occurs in up to 10 per cent of long-haul flights.\u201d\n\nZhang further mentioned the health impacts for certain passengers on flights.\n\n\u201cA lot of research has been undertaken in terms of the how the flight itself \u2013 whether it\u2019s long haul or ultra long haul or even sometimes short haul or medium haul \u2013 have effect on the travellers, because we know that not everyone is physically fit. Especially for those vulnerable travellers, they might have problems with their blood circulation, they might experience hearing problems and heart attacks. So physically, for some travellers, it\u2019s quite challenging.\u201d\n\nThe non-stop flight will reach Sydney on Sunday October 18. Let\u2019s hope everyone on board gets a chance to have a nice long sleep afterward.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
