Adventure World took to Facebook to forbid \u2018cheeky\u2019 bottoms, stating that they found the garment inappropriate as a family-friendly venue.\n\n\u201cAdventure World is a family friendly park,\u201d they posted, \u201cplease choose appropriate swimwear when visiting.\u201d\n\nAdventure World is a family friendly park, please choose appropriate swimwear when visiting\u2026 ???? ???? Posted by Adventure World \u2013 Official Page on Wednesday, 9 October 2019\n\nThe post then became super problematic after the comment section turned into a cesspit for shaming women in swimwear. Like, HELLO, that\u2019s a genderless ass right there. Instead of shaming women, we should be talking about the travesty that is all genders having to hide their glorious buttcracks. I mean, if one of us goes down, we all go down together \u2013 all bussies for one and one bussy for all.\n\nAdventure World then took to Facebook to clarify their declaration:\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not confuse the issue. This update is about dress standards and dress standards only. It is not gender specific.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo those who have taken offence, we apologise. We are not the first park in Australia to update their dress standards on this subject, nor are we the only venue in WA that has addressed the matter with a similar policy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAs a family friendly venue, we feel it is appropriate.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE How To Best Prepare Your Bussy For The Boom Boom\n\nMy first thought that came to mind was, how can you differentiate a \u2018cheeky\u2019 swimwear bottom from a wedgie? Hopping out of a waterslide isn\u2019t the most graceful of experiences, after all.\n\nAlso, who\u2019ll be the gatekeepers of the this rule? Will people be hired to walk around on bottom patrol? Will they walk around with rulers, measuring bathers in terms of their cheekiness?\n\nThese are the questions that will keep me up tonight.", "description": "Adventure World, a waterpark in Perth, has banned 'cheeky' swimwear, stating that they found it inappropriate as a family-friendly venue.", "authors": ["Louis Hanson"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/cheeky-bottom.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
