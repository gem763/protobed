In the latest Morning Consult poll, released Wednesday, she\u2019s up by five percentage points with black voters since August.\n\nThose advances have played a role in her surging overall numbers, which have seen Warren expand her lead over the African-American candidates in the primary \u2014 Sens. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker \u2014 and even overtake Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders in some state and national polls.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly a dramatic shift that had to be noticed by the Biden campaign \u2014 and also Sanders, Harris and Buttigieg,\u201d said Tim Malloy, Qunnipiac\u2019s polling analyst. \u201cOther [candidates] aren\u2019t moving.
