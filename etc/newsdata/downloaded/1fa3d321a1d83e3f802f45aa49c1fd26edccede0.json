Brighton have been excellent, fully deserving of their two-goal lead, and deserve plenty of credit for that first-half display. If they perform like this throughout the season relegation won't be a concern. Tottenham, though, have been dismal, lacklustre, almost disinterested. The early goal and subsequent injury to Lloris won't have helped matters, but they need a big response after the break. Brighton 2-0 Tottenham 45+6 minutes Maupay again causes problems, turning cleverly before firing off a shot from distance. It dips just in front of Gazzaniga, who does well to clutch the ball to his chest. Brighton 2-0 Tottenham 45+5 minutes Mooy beats Sissoko, who's had a tough time at right-back, and whips a dangerous cross into the box. It's headed away, but Brighton continue the attack. Maupay collects the ball at the back post and drills it back across goal. It deflects dangerously and flashes across goal. Advertisement Brighton 2-0 Tottenham 45+1 minutes There'll be seven minutes of injury time because of the Lloris injury. Brighton 2-0 Tottenham 44 minutes A rare counter attack from Tottenham, who surge forward through Son. The ball is eventually worked to Lamela in the box, and his shot, which looks on its way towards the bottom corner, is blocked well by Dunk. Brighton 2-0 Tottenham 42 minutes Now Mooy is given space to shoot from distance and drags a left-footed shot wide. Brighton look like they've got more goals in them. Brighton 2-0 Tottenham 41 minutes Brighton have found it worryingly easy to pass through Tottenham's midfield and pick out teammates in the final third. Again, they're allowed to cross from the left, which is just about cleared. Spurs have been passive in this first half. Advertisement Brighton 2-0 Tottenham 37 minutes Tottenham are a shambles at the moment. Alderweireld plays a terrible pass back to his goalkeeper under pressure, and Gazzaniga's hurried attempt to return the ball to the defender gives Brighton a throw-in deep in Spurs' half. Brighton 2-0 Tottenham 36 minutes Close again! It's far too easy for Brighton to cut Spurs open. The ball is worked out to the right, where Montoya picks out Connolly in the middle. The teenager tries to sweep the ball into the far corner first time but guides his finish narrowly wide. Brighton 2-0 Tottenham 35 minutes Close! Spurs are in disarray. Gross makes his way towards the edge of the box and gets a shot off, which deflects just wide of the far post with Gazzaniga stretching. Something needs to change here for the visitors. GOAL! GOAL! Brighton 2-0 Tottenham (Connolly) 32 minutes A Premier League debut goal for the 19-year-old! Spurs switch off from a throw-in and fail to defend a cross from the left. Connolly sneaks in at the near post, flicking a first time effort at goal. Gazzaniga saves but the youngster is there to convert the rebound. Tottenham are in real trouble here! Advertisement Brighton 1-0 Tottenham 30 minutes Brighton work the ball forward quickly and Connolly is played in behind the Spurs defence. Sissoko comes across and barges the Brighton man off the ball, which brings appeals for a penalty. Referee Jon Moss says no and there's no intervention from VAR. Brighton 1-0 Tottenham 28 minutes Lloris is on his way to A&E having looked in agony as he was stretchered off. Let's hope the injury isn't as bad as it first seemed. Brighton 1-0 Tottenham 26 minutes Matt Ryan is called into action for the first time today. Eriksen finds space just outside the box and gets a shot off, but it's straight at the Brighton goalkeeper. Brighton 1-0 Tottenham 25 minutes Tottenham are forced into more defending as Connolly finds space on the left and swings a cross towards Maupay. It's headed away, but the hosts are well on top at the moment. Advertisement Brighton 1-0 Tottenham 23 minutes Another nice move from Brighton, who work the ball to Mooy on the left. His ball inside is played on to Montoya, but the full-back's attempted cut back is intercepted and Spurs clear. Brighton 1-0 Tottenham 22 minutes Gross swings a cross into the box and Maupay, who's been lively so far, gets to it ahead of Vertonghen, prodding an effort wide. Brighton 1-0 Tottenham 20 minutes There'll be another pause in play after a clash of heads between Maupay and Vertonghen. Both players seem to be fine, although the Spurs man has a nasty bruise below his eye. Brighton 1-0 Tottenham 17 minutes Brighton look assured and composed in the early stages here. Tottenham, meanwhile, are the opposite. They look a little stunned by the early goal and the nasty injury to Lloris that came from it.
