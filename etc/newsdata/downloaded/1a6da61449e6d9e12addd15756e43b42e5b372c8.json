The changes included floating Egypt\u2019s currency, making substantial cuts in state subsidies on basic goods, and introducing a wide range of new taxes.\n\nThe tough austerity measures have won praise from economists and business leaders but have been a heavy blow to poor and middle-class Egyptians. The official statistics agency reported in July that one in three Egyptians is poor.\n\nEarlier this week, el-Sissi said he would do more to protect poor and middle-class Egyptians, in his first remarks on the economy following the protests.\n\nOn Tuesday, the supply ministry said it had put 1.8 million people back in its food staples subsidy program, which provides goods to more than 60 million of Egypt\u2019s nearly 100 million people.\n\nEl-Sissi has made the economy the focus of his rule, with a hands-on drive for fiscal reform, improved infrastructure and construction of new cities. He has urged Egyptians to be patient during the effort to overhaul and economy that is still recovering from unrest following the 2011 uprising that toppled longtime ruler Hosni Mubarak.", "description": "Egypt\u2019s government announced a decrease in fuel prices Thursday for the first time in decades, a cut that comes after a series of hikes in recent years amid an ambitious program aimed at overhauling the country\u2019s ailing economy.
