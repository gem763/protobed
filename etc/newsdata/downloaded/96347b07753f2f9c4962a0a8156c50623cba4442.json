Backstage at the 2013 Emmys (where the show won for best drama), creator Vince Gilligan said that a show like \u201c'Breaking Bad\u2019 might have been nixed before its time had it not been for streaming video services that allow new fans to catch up while a show is still on the air. The show survived, he suggested, because of Netflix.\n\n\u201cI think Netflix kept us on the air,\u201d Gilligan said at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s a new era in television, and we\u2019ve been very fortunate to reap the benefits.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d which ended after five seasons and reportedly wrapped up on Gilligan\u2019s terms, is so renowned now that it\u2019s hard to fathom a time when it was at risk of cancellation. (On its ranking of the best 100 TV shows of all time, Rolling Stone ranked \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d at No. 3.) But the show, which aired on AMC, did not always have such firm control of its fate. The show reportedly never cracked 2 million viewers in its first three seasons. But Sunday on AMC was not the only time and place where people would end up watching \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, Netflix added the first three seasons of the show to its streaming service. Suddenly, a new group of binge-viewers had access to the show and an opportunity to catch up on the seasons they\u2019d missed. The show\u2019s existing fans had a way to nurture their obsession. When the show came back for its fourth season, 2.6 million people reportedly tuned in to AMC.\n\nRinse, repeat. The premiere of Season 5 (which aired in two halves over two years) drew 2.93 million viewers; the premiere of the second half of that season spiked to 5.92 million. By the time Jesse Pinkman sped away to freedom, more than 10 million people were watching.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor viewers who first fell in love with \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d not on Sunday nights but on lost Saturday afternoons, the fact that \u201cEl Camino\u201d has come to Netflix feels less like a premiere than a homecoming.\n\nNetflix has been a boon for other series over the years. After CW\u2019s \u201cRiverdale\u201d spent a summer on Netflix, it started its sophomore season with record ratings. When Netflix added the first two seasons of \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek,\u201d which airs on Pop TV in the United States, the show\u2019s ratings and mentions on Netflix\u2019s social media feeds took off. \u201cYou\u201d started off as a little-watched psychological thriller on Lifetime. Once Netflix got it, it became a hit. Now, it\u2019s a Netflix Original title.\n\nThe more I think about it, the more I think \"You\" flailing on Lifetime and being treated by the viewing public as a Netflix original is going to be remembered as a major turning point in what will shortly be a contraction of the TV industry. \u2014 Daniel D'Addario (@DPD_) January 14, 2019\n\nNetflix\u2019s cultural grip never overshadowed \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d since the show became iconic in its own right. But as an addicting show that could be dealt to those craving a binge, \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d and Netflix have been a match made in heaven.\n\nAD", "description": "\u201cI think Netflix kept us on the air,\u201d creator Vince Gilligan said in 2013, when the show was still airing on AMC.", "authors": ["Travis Deshong", "Features Reporting"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/SqBPYZHSuYySWfsKpXUI3ATOnsc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Q2AHUSXLPMI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
