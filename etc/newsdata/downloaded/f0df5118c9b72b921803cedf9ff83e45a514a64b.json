Aaron Doster-USA TODAY Sports/File Photo\n\n(Reuters) - Former world number one Andy Murray said he still needs four or five months to play top-level tennis so that he can again take on old rivals Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal after career-saving hip surgery earlier this year.\n\nThe 32-year-old is regaining his fitness after a hip resurfacing procedure in January, and late last month recorded the first two victories of his singles comeback at the Rafa Nadal Open Challenger tournament in Mallorca before making a third-round exit.\n\nBriton Murray, who has dropped to 415 in the world rankings, will next compete in Zhuhai, Beijing and Shanghai in the Asian swing of the ATP tour this year, but the three-times major winner thinks that it will be 2020 before he is \u201cmaybe\u201d able to face the challenge of playing Federer or Nadal.\n\n\u201cFor years... I competed against them, although I haven\u2019t won every time. I\u2019ve lost more than I\u2019ve won but I always went out onto court feeling I could win,\u201d Murray told Sky Sports.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019d enjoy going out on court against them knowing I\u2019m going to lose or feeling like I had no chance. That would probably be psychologically challenging... I need to be patient and not expect too much too soon.\n\n\u201cBut maybe in four or five months, I can get there. In terms of how I\u2019m hitting the ball in practice... the skill is still there. I physically need to get a little better and hopefully over time I get a little bit faster... I think I will.\u201d\n\nMurray is hopeful of being picked in Britain\u2019s Davis Cup team for the Nov. 18-24 Finals in Madrid, adding he would be happy playing only doubles if necessary.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m selected I\u2019ll play. I don\u2019t want to play or be selected just because four years ago I played really well,\u201d Murray, who guided Britain to the title in 2015, added.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to help and be in the team and play singles, but if I was asked to play doubles I\u2019d probably do that.\u201d", "description": "Former world number one Andy Murray said he still needs four or five months to play top-level tennis so that he can again take on old rivals Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal after career-saving hip surgery earlier this year.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429405318&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C0VC-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
