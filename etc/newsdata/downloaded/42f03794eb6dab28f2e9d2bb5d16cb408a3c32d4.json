Instead of reporting the crimes that I told them about, my bosses just covered them up'.\n\nEY declined to comment to Panorama about the rewriting of the report, but a spokesman said the firm delivered its findings to the relevant regulator in Dubai.\n\nIt said: 'It was the work of EY Dubai that brought to light Kaloti's non-compliance with the applicable regulations and ultimately resulted in the remediation of the issues.\n\n'More recently, and many years after these events, Mr Rihan has raised certain unfounded allegations in a legal claim which is being vigorously defended'.\n\nUnder the proceeds of crime legislation, accountants have a legal duty to report any suspicious activity to the police.\n\nEY said that Mr Rihan, pictured in the BBC Panorama documentary, has 'raised certain unfounded allegations in a legal claim which is being vigorously defended'\n\nIn its legal dispute with Mr Rihan, EY admits that the disguised gold 'provided reasonable grounds for knowing or suspecting\u2026.money laundering'.\n\nHowever, the firm has claimed it did not have to report this to police because its auditors were not carrying out accountancy work at Kaloti.\n\nKaloti said that it had conducted all appropriate anti-money laundering checks.\n\nA spokesman said: 'Kaloti would not knowingly enter into a trading relationship with any party in the knowledge that such party had been engaged in financial impropriety or criminal activity of any kind.\n\n'It is categorically denied that Kaloti purchased gold coated in silver from Renade, or anyone else for that matter.'\n\nKaloti added that cash payments were common in Dubai, but it no longer buys gold for cash.\n\nPanorama: Following the Drug Money will be shown on BBC One tonight at 8.30pm", "description": "Ernst & Young (EY) allegedly failed to report evidence of smuggling, according to an investigation by BBC Panorama and the French news agency Premieres Lignes.", "authors": ["Mark Duell For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/11/20276788-0-image-a-42_1572263123165.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
