That makes for a revenue of $4.3 billion, according to research conducted by the group, which represents approximately 80 percent of the music industry\u2019s overall revenue.\n\nAlthough this included both paid subscriptions and ad-supported streams, the report also found that paid subscriptions grew by 31 percent, accounting for 62 percent of the industry\u2019s total revenue. Spotify has more than 100 million subscribers, and Apple Music boasts 56 million paid subscribers. The record industry in the US saw an 18 percent increase in revenue \u2014 hitting $5.4 billion \u2014 in the first six months of 2019.\n\nIt\u2019s not just streaming that\u2019s helping the industry see a boost, though: physical media sales also jumped. Both vinyl and CDs saw increases in sales, growing 5 and 13 percent, respectively. CD sales made up roughly $485 million of the industry\u2019s revenue over the first six months of the year, and vinyl sales brought in an additional $224 million.\n\nEven with the notable increases in physical media purchases, it\u2019s clear that streaming is a dominant force for the industry in the United States. More artists have embraced streaming platforms, too. Taylor Swift, Drake, and Ariana Grande are some of the top performers on services like Spotify, according to the study. Even Tool recently made their music available on streaming platforms for the first time. Still, artists are only paid a fraction of every stream.", "description": "More people are streaming music through services like Apple Music and Spotify, and the record industry is seeing a major lift: revenue made from streaming services in the United States grew by 26 percent in the first six months of the year.", "authors": ["Julia Alexander", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lZDCAAvw1l8rtkV7IHgrmKFKlaA=/0x402:3600x2287/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19173072/994626130.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
