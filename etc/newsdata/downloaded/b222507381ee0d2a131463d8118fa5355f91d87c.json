In the past, even getting tattoos or selling gear has led to infractions from the NCAA. The law makes complications for the NCAA and other states to sort out.\n\n\u201cIt is rather remarkable what is happening in college sports.\u201d - Gov. Gavin Newsom, of California\n\nNewsom, a former college baseball player who received a partial scholarship to attend Santa Clara University, defended the legislation, which has created a firestorm of conversation, he signed on Monday. He spoke to The Athletic\u2019s \u201cTHE LEAD\u201d podcast about the controversial law.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a rather perverse system of \u2014 I would argue \u2014 exploitation,\u201d Newsom told \u201cTHE LEAD. \u201cAnd I think its time is coming to an end, and that\u2019s the purpose of our efforts in California, is to call the question.\u201d\n\nNewsom said that getting a college scholarship to play baseball \u201cis the reason I\u2019m governor of California,\u201d opening the door of higher education to someone with dyslexia.
