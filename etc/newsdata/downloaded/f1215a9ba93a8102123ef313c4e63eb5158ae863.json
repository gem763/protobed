They took the lead after 35 seconds and after shipping five first-half goals, recovered to win the second half 2-0.\n\nThey were applauded off at the end, England\u2019s fans also appreciating a courageous display of attacking football from Swiss coach Bernard Challandes\u2019s youthful side, many of whom were either born abroad or fled Kosovo as a child during a bloody war with Serbia from 1998-99.\n\nKosovo, only given official soccer status in 2016 by world governing body FIFA and whose attempt to qualify for the World Cup was a dismal failure, are still ranked 120th but are destined to go much higher.\n\nSome might suggest their performance was a touch naive, electing to go toe-to-toe with a rampant England side who had scored 14 goals in three Group A games against Czech Republic, Montenegro and Bulgaria.\n\nBut Challandes said he would have it no other way \u2014 not wanting to stifle the natural attacking instincts that had taken them to second in the group ahead of kick off.\n\nWhen Valon Berisha scored their opening goal inside a minute, Kosovo\u2019s fans were in dreamland, and they were still roaring their team forward at the end after a gutsy second-half display that caused jitters in the home defence.\n\n\u201cIn the second half we really showed our true face of Kosovo,\u201d Lazio\u2019s Berisha, who was born in Oslo to Kosovo-Albanian parents and played 20 times for Norway before switching allegiance to Kosovo in 2016, said.\n\n\u201cWe proved to everybody we\u2019re a good team. We\u2019re a unit and we work for each other. We want everybody to know Kosovo \u2014 it\u2019s a small country but with a lot of heart, a lot of young talent.\u201d\n\nChallandes took charge in 2018 and his side were on a 15-match unbeaten run before running into a Raheem Sterling-inspired England. With the Czechs winning 3-0 against Montenegro they slipped to third in the table, outside the qualification spots but the coach said they will stick to their philosophy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about playing and taking risks against a very good opponent,\u201d he said. \u201cWe could stay behind the ball and not play football or look for double pass or short pass, and in the end it could still be 4-0 or 5-0.\n\n\u201cI said to the team, \u2018Go and try and have no regrets\u2019.\u201d\n\nKosovo still have to host Montenegro and England and travel to the Czech Republic \u2014 a match that could be key to their hopes, although even if they miss out in Group A they could still qualify via the Nations League playoffs.", "description": "Kosovo arrived like a breath of fresh sea air on England's south coast on Tuesday and while they were eventually swamped in a 5-3 defeat, the manner of their performance will have many hoping they qualify for the Euro 2020 finals.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428665667&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A0VJ", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
