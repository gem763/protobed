For example, a business contact told the Boston Fed chip manufacturers were delaying new plant construction due to uncertainty over trade policy.\n\nLikewise, an industrial supplier in the district now planned to cut capital expenditures by as much as 25% compared to a previously planned 5% increase.\n\nThe U.S.-China trade war, now 15 months long, has dragged on economic growth. U.S. manufacturing activity dropped to a 10\u2014year low in September and business investment has cooled as firms delay making decisions due to the uncertainty over tariffs.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, data showed U.S. retail sales fell for the first time in seven months, suggesting that manufacturing-led weakness could be spreading to the broader economy.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump last Friday outlined the first phase of a deal to end the trade war and suspended a threatened tariff hike, but officials on both sides said much more work needed to be done before an accord could be agreed.\n\n\"A number of districts reported that manufacturers reduced their headcounts because orders were soft,\" the Fed said, as it noted both retailers and manufacturers were seeing rising input costs, \"often for items subject to new tariffs.\"\n\nReports on retail sales from businesses across the country were mixed but household spending remained solid on balance, the Fed said.\n\nThe Fed has cut interest rates twice this year, reversing course after three years of periodic rate hikes. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has characterized the rate cuts as a pre-emptive strike against slowing global growth, trade tensions and moderate inflation in order to keep the longest economic expansion on record going.\n\nOn Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund warned the trade war will cut global growth this year to its slowest pace since the 2008\u20142009 financial crisis.\n\nElsewhere in the report, contacts reported the job market remained tight and overall, employment rose slightly amid an ongoing struggle to find workers.\n\nInvestors currently see the Fed cutting rates by another quarter percentage point at its next meeting at the end of October, according to an analysis of Fed funds futures contracts compiled by the CME Group.\n\nThe Beige Book was prepared by the Cleveland Fed with information collected on or before October 7.", "description": "The latest temperature check of the economy, collated from the central bank's discussions with business contacts around the country, also said the pace of price increases remained modest.
