It looked like a hit in real time, and some in the audience laughed and hooted, but it was way too much. Biden was more or less stumbling his way through the debate in the manner to which we\u2019ve become accustomed, but Castro was over the top and and just looked mean.\n\nIt was an odd debate. All the build-up was about having the three heavyweights\u2014Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders\u2014on the same stage for the first time, which would surely mean that Warren and Sanders were going to lay it on Biden thick to prove that he was too much the mushy centrist and just way too old for this (even though he\u2019s younger than Sanders, by 14 months). But they didn\u2019t manage to lay a glove on him.\n\nBiden still can\u2019t complete a complex sentence without stopping himself in the middle. That Afghanistan explanation was\u2026what?! He was incoherent sometimes. What kind of offenders shouldn\u2019t face jail time? He said one thing but obviously meant another.", "description": "The frontrunner lost the thread a few times Thursday night, but no one coming up behind him managed to knock him from the top of the hill.", "authors": ["Michael Tomasky", "Special Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568348689/190912-tomasky-biden-tease_1_gzuu2y", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
