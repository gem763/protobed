No evidence about the existence of an Operation Contingency Plan has been given.\u2019 He added: \u2018On one view of the evidence, when Stay Put was changed, the alternative employed was a sporadic call to self-evacuation which relied on residents calling into the LFB, rather than the LFB having an operational means of contacting them.\u2019\n\nThe revelation comes ahead of the publication on Wednesday of the long-awaited first report from the inquiry in which the LFB is likely to be heavily criticised.\n\nThis weekend, survivors and the families of the 72 who died demanded the report be as hard-hitting as that of the Macpherson Inquiry into the murder of Stephen Lawrence which branded the Met as \u2018institutionally racist\u2019.\n\nBut sources at the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) expressed fears the report will not only criticise bosses such as Dany Cotton, the Commissioner of the LFB, but also individual rank-and-file firefighters.\n\nThe inquiry chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick is also likely to criticise the LFB\u2019s 999 call handling centre which was not given \u2018real time\u2019 information from the ground. As a result, call handlers wrongly told people that the fire was confined to the fourth floor.\n\nEarlier this month, Ms Cotton admitted the Stay Put advice was unsuitable for Grenfell, despite previously insisting it had been right.\n\nGrenfell United, an organisation set up to help the survivors and families of victims of Grenfell, said they hoped Sir Martin would rule in his first report that the tower had been \u2018non-compliant\u2019 with fire regulations, allowing the flames to engulf it so quickly.\n\nThe LFB said: \u2018It is important that we understand the full detail of this report and any recommendations it may make, and it would be premature to comment on specific issues\u2026 at this stage.\u2019\n\nMatt Wrack, FBU general secretary, said: \u2018Firefighters and emergency fire control room staff acted heroically on the night of the fire. Firefighters did not cause the fire and must not be scapegoated.\u2019", "description": "London Fire Brigade had no 'Plan B' to cope with the Grenfell Tower disaster once the fire had spread from the fourth floor.
