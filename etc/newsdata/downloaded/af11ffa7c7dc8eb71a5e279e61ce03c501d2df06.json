Bush administration have proliferated under Trump. Among the U.S. government\u2019s 32 active sanctions programs are exceptionally severe sanctions regimes with exceedingly ambitious objectives, such as coercing North Korea\u2019s dictator into giving up his nuclear-weapons arsenal, Iran\u2019s supreme leader into renouncing his nuclear pursuits and malicious activities in the Middle East, and Venezuela\u2019s authoritarian leader into ceding power and ushering in democracy.\n\nThis has, in short, become the Trump administration\u2019s one consistent move when confronted with the world\u2019s most complex problems: squeeze countries economically while staying open to dialogue and offering to release the economic vise if they mend their ways. The administration has proved adept at the squeeze, but more inept when it comes to changing behavior. It has so far failed to achieve its desired outcomes in Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, and now Syria.\n\nRead: Why is Turkey in NATO anyway?\n\nAhead of launching its military operation against the Kurds, the Turkish government was acquainted with this approach not just from observing Trump, but also from its own brush with the tactic. Last year Trump slapped sanctions on two Turkish officials and raised steel and aluminum tariffs on the country as part of an effort to pressure Ankara into releasing the imprisoned American pastor Andrew Brunson. The measures contributed to a precipitous drop in the value of Turkey\u2019s currency and ultimately to Brunson being freed.\n\nClearly, though, the prospect of Trump repeating the Brunson play wasn\u2019t enough to keep Erdo\u011fan in check this time around, as U.S. officials themselves have acknowledged. The Turkish government would \u201ctell you with complete confidence that nothing that we did, one way or the other, was going to deter the Turks from what they wanted to do in this case,\u201d a senior Trump administration official said on Monday while briefing reporters on the condition of anonymity. Erdo\u011fan didn\u2019t have to call Trump\u2019s bluff; Trump was already showing his hand.\n\nErdo\u011fan, in fact, may have priced in the possibility of economic retaliation in deciding to proceed with his offensive in Syria.\n\nThe Turkish president probably anticipated U.S. sanctions, Soner Cagaptay, a Turkey scholar at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and the author of the new book Erdogan\u2019s Empire, told me. But Erdo\u011fan and Trump have a good rapport, even an apparent \u201cpolitical man crush on each other\u201d as like-minded \u201cstrongmen presidents,\u201d he noted. And Erdo\u011fan expects Trump to ultimately \u201csave the relationship,\u201d such as when the U.S. president held back last summer on imposing congressionally mandated sanctions on Turkey over the NATO member\u2019s purchase of a Russian missile-defense system.", "description": "The U.S. financial system is powerful, but not so powerful that it can swiftly stop a military assault in its tracks.", "authors": ["Uri Friedman"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTS2R3C6/facebook.jpg?1571169259", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
