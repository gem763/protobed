Turkey cannot lose even a single day on this issue. There is no other choice but to act on our own,\" Erdogan said at the parliament's opening ceremony in Ankara.\n\n\"We plan to settle two million people in the safe zones we will establish. We calculated the costs and we will carry out efforts to improve. We will start taking steps as soon as the region is saved from the invasion of terror,\" he said.\n\nStrained ties\n\nThe US agreed to the \"safe zone| as a way to protect its Kurdish allies in Syria and address Turkish concerns about the border, after President Donald Trump announced plans last year to abruptly withdraw 2,000 US special forces troops that helped Kurdish fighters battle the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS) armed group.\n\nBut the US troops have yet to leave and Washington and Ankara have so far failed to agree on details. Turkey has accused the United States of dragging its feet and warned that it would take matters into its own hands.\n\nWhile diplomats, analysts and Turkey's main opposition say Ankara would be unwilling to anger Washington with a military incursion as the allies try to repair strained ties, Erdogan's comments marked the clearest indication of an offensive in the region.\n\nThe president said Turkey aimed to host an \"international donors meeting\" to get funding for its plans in the area, which he said would stretch from the Euphrates river in Syria east to the Iraqi border.\n\nErdogan has repeatedly called on Turkey's allies to provide financial support for the plans, including in his speech at the United Nations last month.\n\nBut Ankara is unlikely to receive a response for any plan that settles people hundreds of kilometres from their homes and alters the demographics of northeast Syria.\n\nErdogan, who has supported rebels fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, will also face opposition from Damascus's most powerful backers: Russia and Iran.\n\nInside Turkey, where the 3.6 million Syrian refugees have become a heated political issue as the country's economy struggles to emerge from recession, the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) also says Damascus must be involved.\n\n\"First of all, any kind of zone which is going to be created within Syrian territory should be controlled by Syrian authorities,\" Unal Cevikoz, CHP vice president and former Turkish diplomat, told Reuters news agency.\n\n\"We have insistently called on the government that we should get into dialogue with Damascus.\"", "description": "Deadline set by Turkey for action with US expires, bringing prospect of unilateral military intervention closer.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/1/e800e63eec3248ceb61f45ed78114997_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
