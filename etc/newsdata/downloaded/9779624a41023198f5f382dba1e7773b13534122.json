Everyone seemed to be minding their own business inside the store, a witness, Ren\u00e9e Salda\u00f1a, told BuzzFeed News. From somewhere amid the aisles, it sounded like a mother might have been scolding her child.\n\nAD\n\nThen, came the piercing shout of the n-word.\n\n\u201cI was like, what the hell is happening?\u201d Salda\u00f1a told BuzzFeed. \u201cI could only hear one voice traveling through the CVS yelling really hateful, violent things.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nA crowd of about a dozen people gathered around the woman at the front of the drugstore, where \u201cit felt like there was violence in the air,\u201d she said. Salda\u00f1a started filming, and so did Adrene Ashford, a black costume designer who had also been shopping at the CVS, according to her Instagram post. They wanted to be sure they could document the incident in case it further escalated: Was the woman going to leave? Did she have a gun? What exactly was causing her to explode?\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYeah, she\u2019s on drugs or something,\u201d someone can be heard saying on the video.\n\nIn the video, after bystanders followed her outside the store to her SUV, she he proudly showed off her license plate before screeching west down Colorado Avenue, driving down the wrong side of the street.\n\nInside the CVS, the crowd was left stunned, Salda\u00f1a said. \u201cThis woman, who looks like anyone you could see at a PTA meeting or next to you in yoga class, is out here terrorizing people in CVS,\u201d she said.\n\nAD\n\nShe called the LAPD to report the incident. One neighbor, identified as \u201cTony,\u201d told KTLA that he had filed restraining orders against the woman and her husband in the past for threatening to assault him and yelling racial slurs.\n\n\u201cGo back to your country. This is not a place for you,\u201d the man claimed that she had yelled.\n\nTony provided the TV station with security footage he said showed the woman previously threatening to slit someone\u2019s throat and said she\u2019d also vandalized his father\u2019s truck.\n\nAD", "description": "Her profanity-laden tirade, which has been viewed nearly 2 million times on Facebook as of early Friday, has sparked a police investigation and gained her the Internet moniker #KuKluxKaren.", "authors": ["Teo Armus", "Reporter On The Morning Mix Team"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/TxTOEI4HO4x9rfQdRxDlq44Q9_o=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3JFMQ3LNNFFH3KCL6CRIQP75LU.JPG", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
