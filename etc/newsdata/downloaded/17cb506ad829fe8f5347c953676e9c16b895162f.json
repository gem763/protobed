Barclays (LON: ) joins other British lenders such as Royal Bank of Scotland (LON: ), which has blamed the domestic economic environment for putting its targets at risk.\n\nThe corporate and investment bank\u2019s third-quarter total income jumped 17% from the same period last year as revenue from fixed income and equities both advanced, Barclays (LON: ) said in the statement. Barclays outperformed its U.S. peers, whose trading income rose an average of 6.4%, according to Bloomberg calculations.\n\nBarclays (LON: ) aims to boost return on tangible equity, a key measure of profitability, above 9% this year and then raise it past 10% in 2020. While Staley didn\u2019t revise those targets, Citigroup Inc (NYSE: ). analysts have said 7% is a more realistic goal in the near term. To have any hope of meeting the targets, the American-born CEO must maintain a tight grip on expenses.\n\nStaley repeated that Barclays (LON: ) plans to reduce expenses beyond its previous guidance, which had a lower bound of 13.6 billion pounds ($17.5 billion). The CIB unit\u2019s revenue of 2.62 billion pounds beat the 2.42 billion-pound consensus analyst estimate.\n\nAccording to the bank\u2019s first-half results, Barclays (LON: ) shed about 3,000 jobs in the second quarter and cut variable compensation by more than 20%. Staley\u2019s brake on costs has come at the expense of executive tumult: in a dispute over bonus cuts, he ousted his hand-picked head investment banker, Tim Throsby, and took direct control of the unit last spring.\n\nThe stock has lost almost 25% since Staley took the top job in December 2015. That sluggish performance led activist Edward Bramson to launch a campaign against the CEO\u2019s strategy last year, arguing that the bank should redeploy capital from its investment bank to higher-returning businesses like retail banking and credit cards. Bramson has repeatedly said the lender is following a \u201cdestructive strategy.\"", "description": "Barclays Sees Challenging 2020 Even as Investment Bank Rallies", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic24fe08462eaee4c75373942a4be93286.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
