His colleague Anthony Veneziale, who had an extensive improv background, suggested they perform it in front of people.\n\nSo they did, in a show they called Freestyle Love Supreme, borrowing its name from John Coltrane\u2019s 1965 album A Love Supreme, and billed as a hip-hop improv show. Miranda and his cohorts first performed it in the cramped basement of the temporarily closed theater-district location of New York City staple Drama Book Shop in 2003, basing the show on audience suggestions and making up the rest on the spot. Starting Oct. 2, the show will make its official Broadway debut at the Booth Theatre. \u201cThis was not a show that would, in our wildest dreams, play Broadway,\u201d says Miranda. \u201cI could show you footage of us with flyers, busking and making up raps and begging people to come to the show. We\u2019ve come very far\u2014and at the same time, it\u2019s also been five blocks.\u201d\n\nThat the show is on Broadway at all is a testament to the power of Miranda\u2019s brand. Following the success of In the Heights, the writer-director-performer won universal acclaim for his show Hamilton, which has led to an eclectic career: he\u2019s behind an upcoming remake of The Little Mermaid, a big-screen take on In the Heights and a movie version of Jonathan Larson\u2019s play Tick, Tick \u2026 Boom!, which he\u2019ll direct\u2014plus he\u2019ll star in an adaptation of the fantasy novel series His Dark Materials, which premieres on Nov. 4 on HBO. Yet the joys of Freestyle Love Supreme continued to ricochet around his creative psyche. \u201cIt never went away,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was always this supporting exercise that made all other things possible.\u201d\n\nDusting off the show for Broadway was a way for Miranda to honor his creative past while helping push into the future. Improv is an art form mainly relegated to tiny stages, rarely performed at this scale. \u201cWe tried to do research into improv on Broadway,\u201d says Veneziale, \u201cand only came up with one or two things that fall vaguely into the realm of it. It feels pretty singular.\u201d Director Thomas Kail, a longtime Miranda collaborator who also directed Hamilton and In the Heights, worked to give the show some basic structure while still allowing it to stay loose. \u201cThere\u2019s a liberation in doing something like this,\u201d he says. \u201cUnlike anything we\u2019ve ever done, it takes this strange skill set we have and celebrates it.\u201d\n\nThe 16-week Broadway run features a rotating group of freestylers\u2014among them Miranda and Veneziale as well as Chris Sullivan, a beatboxer known as Shockwave and longtime member Utkarsh Ambudkar. Though Miranda\u2019s calendar is jam-packed, it\u2019s a priority for him to work in this way, without the restraints of scripted projects. \u201cWe do it for the joy of doing it,\u201d he says, \u201cand for the freedom that comes with getting onstage without a plan and connecting with an audience in the most visceral way possible: \u2018Tell us what\u2019s on your mind, and we\u2019re going to make a show for you.\u2019\u201d\n\nThough that may sound intimidating\u2014standing in front of that many people onstage without a plan\u2014Veneziale says it gets more natural after decades of practice. \u201cIt comes from a subliminal part of your subconscious, so you\u2019re able to trust your abilities,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you freestyle enough, you start dreaming in freestyle.\u201d Miranda agrees, noting that the ability to improvise rhymed verses now comes as organically to him as speaking another language. \u201cA lot of my life is pretty scheduled,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m juggling two kids, a marriage and a lot of projects. When I get to do a freestyle show, I don\u2019t think of any of that.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Lin-Manuel Miranda's new hip-hop improv show 'Freestyle Love Supreme' will make its official Broadway debut at The Booth Theatre on Oct. 2.", "authors": ["Rob Ledonne"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/freestyle-love-supreme-lin-manuel-miranda.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}
