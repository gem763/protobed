Almost a week after the storm devastated parts of the Bahamas\u2019 northern archipelago, the full extent of damage and loss of life is still unclear and rescues continue.\n\nThe death toll stands at 30, but officials are expecting the number to rise.\n\nTop: A damaged house in High Rock, on the eastern part of Grand Bahama island.\n\nBottom: The High Rock police station. All photos by Angel Valentin.\n\nLocal residents who stayed behind each have their own survival stories.\n\nSome clung to tree branches for days on end; others witnessed their neighbors swept away in the winds. Many are still desperately searching for loved ones who went missing in the storm and while two people in High Rock have been found dead, dozens remain unaccounted for.\n\nThe surrounding forests were blasted so hard there are hardly any leaves left on trees. Of the handful of homes still standing, most are without roofs.\n\nTop: Sherman Roberts, 62, takes a break from cleaning a friend\u2019s house.\n\nBottom: Inside the house of Ishmael Laing, which suffered extensive water damage.\n\nSome residents, including Euridice Kemp, were quick to link the ferocity of hurricane Dorian to the global climate crisis.\n\nKemp, who returned to the town to salvage what she could from her grandparents\u2019 home, said: \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing to Mother Earth and the way this turns around on areas like here \u2026 I just can\u2019t. Never \u2026 never in my life. My heart is broken. I\u2019m in shock.\u201d\n\nTop left: Euridice Kemp outside her grandparents\u2019 destroyed home.

Bottom: Residents in a truck going to their homes.\n\nThe sheer force of the winds was enough to transform this area for the foreseeable future. Trees that have stood for generations were uprooted. Large structures, including a nearby lighthouse, are partially or completely destroyed.\n\nMany here are only beginning to come to terms with what they have lost. Hardly anyone knows what will happen next: whether to rebuild, or start over.", "description": "Some survived by clinging to tree branches. Many are still searching for loved ones.
