REUTERS/Piroschka van de Wouw\n\nMADRID (Reuters) - Spain\u2019s acting prime minister said he would visit Barcelona on Monday to see police injured in protests that have racked Catalonia and accused the region\u2019s pro-separatist leader of failing in his duties.\n\nIn a toughly worded letter, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said Catalonia\u2019s regional chief Quim Torra had \u201cturned his back\u201d on the embattled security forces and reiterated that he needed to condemn forcefully the recent unrest.\n\nBarcelona has been hit by seven consecutive nights of sometimes violent protests following the jailing last week of nine Catalan separatists found guilty of sedition over their role in leading a failed 2017 drive for independence.\n\nSanchez told Torra that his job as head of the regional government was to protect public safety and ensure a harmonious co-existence between the pro- and anti-secessionist camps.\n\n\u201cYour conduct in the past few days has gone in precisely the opposite direction,\u201d Sanchez said in the letter.\n\nSpanish media reported that Torra tried to talk to Sanchez by telephone on both Saturday and Sunday, but was rebuffed.\n\nTorra said in a statement at the weekend he had always condemned violence and criticized the prime minister for shunning dialogue.\n\nSanchez will visit police officers injured in the protests and meet with security forces in the region, the government said. The interior ministry said on Sunday that 288 police had been hurt in the clashes and 194 people arrested.", "description": "Spain's acting prime minister said he would visit Barcelona on Monday to see police injured in protests that have racked Catalonia and accused the region's pro-separatist leader of failing in his duties.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443250670&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K0CX", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
