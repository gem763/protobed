The date was further extended to Nov. 19 due to national holidays in India, which fall on the initial set date.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India against cryptocurrencies\n\nIn late August, the Supreme Court slammed the country\u2019s central bank over its handling of the cryptocurrency business ban and ordered it to address complaints, giving the bank two weeks to justify it.\n\nOriginally issued in early April 2018, the RBI\u2019s crypto circular prohibits banks from providing services to any individual or business that deals with cryptocurrencies while adding that it was also exploring releasing its own cryptocurrency in the future.\n\nFollowing the circular release, the High Court of Delhi criticized it, stating that the RBI\u2019s decision to end dealings with crypto businesses violates the constitution. The Supreme Court has continued to uphold the RBI ban even after hearing a number of petitions.\n\nComplete ban on digital currencies\n\nIn late April, the Indian government reportedly began inter-ministerial consultations on the \u201cBanning of Cryptocurrencies and Regulation of Official Digital Currencies Bill 2019\" draft bill, having found support from a number of government departments.\n\nIn June, the RBI denied having any knowledge or involvement in the draft, claiming that it had had no communication from the central government about the proposed law and had not received a copy of the draft bill.\n\nLater in July, a government panel recommended that the government ban cryptocurrencies and impose sanctions for any dealings involving crypto assets.", "description": "The Supreme Court of India has postponed a hearing on the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s circular banning banks from rendering services to crypto-related businesses", "authors": ["Ana Alexandre"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvYzJkZjllZWRlMTdiNjJjYTkyNDJkMDRjYzY4Zjc1MTcuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
