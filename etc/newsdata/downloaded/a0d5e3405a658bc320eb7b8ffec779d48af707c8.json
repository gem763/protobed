Rothschild was the financial adviser for Fedrigoni, while Tamburi Investment Partners advised Ritrama.\n\nRitrama, whose products include coated and uncoated roll label paper for consumer product packaging as well as airport luggage tags, reported sales of 400 million euros in 2018. Fedrigoni had sales of 1.2 billion euros in the same period.\n\nThe Rink family, founders of Ritrama, will maintain ownership of Ritrama's North American operations.
