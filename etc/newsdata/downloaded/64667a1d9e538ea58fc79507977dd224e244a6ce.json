Without consulting Congress, Trump called President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and agreed to withdraw almost all U.S. troops in northern Syria and essentially allowed Turkish forces to invade Kurdish strongholds to attack their longtime rivals, who for years had been the chief U.S. allies in the fight against the Islamic State.\n\nWith that, Turkey lost its already wavering support on Capitol Hill, and the dam burst with a flow of proposed sanctions, which also were approved by the House on Tuesday, and new momentum behind the long-stalled effort to officially recognize the Armenian genocide.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) smiled, pausing for five seconds and shrugging her shoulders, when asked if Trump\u2019s move had eased the way toward recognizing the genocide.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere was just an aura of what the Turks could be doing, is engaged again in genocide, by the greenlight that the president gave them. So that was sort of a callback,\u201d Pelosi said Tuesday.\n\nThe resolution still faces an uphill climb toward winning passage in the Senate, but just this mere victory represented a seismic shift against the usual powers of Washington insiders to thwart things that seem so obvious to most people.\n\nThe resolution is one of the rare things that Reps. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) and Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), bitter rivals as chairman and ranking minority-party member of the House Intelligence Committee, completely agree on.\n\nAfter the vote, Schiff described the explanations he heard the past two decades from members: \u201cI don\u2019t want to offend Turkey, now is just not the right time. . . . It was never the right time.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat changed, in overwhelming fashion the past few weeks, when Pelosi agreed to bypass the committee process and bring Schiff\u2019s resolution to the full House.\n\n\u201cI think that members felt that they were no longer comfortable carrying Turkish water on the genocide when Turkey was once again engaged in a campaign of ethnic cleansing,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cArmenian Genocide recognition could finally receive vote on House floor,\u201d Nunes tweeted Monday, linking to a story about the pending vote.\n\nSchiff was a central player the last time the House came close to voting on the Armenian genocide resolution, in October 2000 when he was a state senator running in what was then the most expensive congressional race of all time for his Los Angeles-area district.\n\nAD\n\nThe House speaker at the time, J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.), campaigned for the incumbent, James Rogan (R), and promised to hold a vote on the resolution just weeks before the election, giving all credit to Rogan. The House minority leader at the time, Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), cried foul and said Hastert was playing domestic politics with foreign policy \u2014 but he also pledged to pass the resolution if Democrats won the majority and he became speaker.\n\nAD\n\nHowever, in the last weeks before the November 2000 election, the State Department intervened and persuaded Hastert to stand down because Turkey served as such a critical NATO ally, particularly with its inroads to Middle Eastern nations.\n\nSchiff went on to win the race and rise to national prominence as the lead investigator in the impeachment inquiry of Trump, but he could never get the full House to vote on the Armenian resolution \u2014 not even when Pelosi served as speaker for four years last decade.\n\nAD\n\nInstead, Turkey\u2019s government, as well as its business alliances, built a lobbying behemoth that thwarted any effort at acknowledging what its predecessors had done.\n\nGephardt and Hastert, once out of Congress, switched sides and went to work for Ankara\u2019s government.\n\nFrom 2008 through 2015, Gephardt\u2019s firm had collected $8 million, and just a couple months after his cooling-off period ended in early 2009, Hastert signed a $35,000-a-month retainer to lobby for Turkey and, among other issues, block the Armenian resolution vote.\n\nAD\n\nBoth Republican and Democratic secretaries of state, including Condoleezza Rice and Hillary Clinton, fought the effort to officially condemn the Ottoman Empire for its slaughter.\n\nAD\n\nIn 2017 and 2018, Turkey and its government-affiliated entities spent about $13.4 million lobbying Washington, according to Open Secrets, with its biggest firm, Ballard Partners, led by Trump\u2019s most well-connected supporter from Florida. They also added the Daschle Group, founded by former Senate majority leader Thomas A. Daschle (D-S.D.), to bolster their bipartisan credentials.\n\nAnkara\u2019s lobbyists in Washington pushed hard the past few weeks, after Trump called Erdogan and the Turks attacked the Kurds. Just 11 Republicans listened to that campaign, most of whom are the administration\u2019s staunchest allies.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of confidence in the president and the administration knowing what to do in Turkey, and I didn\u2019t want to interfere,\u201d said freshman Rep. Greg Pence (R-Ind.), the brother of Vice President Pence.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe State Department put in a cursory effort this time around, nothing like previous full-force efforts to stop the Armenian resolution.\n\n\u201cNo one\u2019s called me, no one\u2019s called me. I think maybe they knew that I wouldn\u2019t be influenced by it,\u201d House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.) said before the vote.\n\nSchiff said today\u2019s events made that fight pointless.\n\n\u201cThere are human rights abuses going on today, and the echo through time, I think, was just too powerful to ignore,\u201d he said.\n\nAD", "description": "For decades, intense lobbying and State Department opposition thwarted congressional efforts to recognize the Ottoman Empire\u2019s slaughter of 1.5 million Armenians a century ago.", "authors": ["Paul Kane", "Senior Congressional Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/SRlE-vi96RqabU96xk6Y9x3XR78=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LS6TXTH2SMI6TAMQNPSN5NLOAE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
