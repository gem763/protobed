Other coaches (including the one who currently coaches the Cowboys) would regard that as a faux pas. Cowboys owner Jerry Jones regards it differently.\n\n\u201cFor Urban Meyer to say that is a compliment,\u201d Jones said on 105.3 The Fan in Dallas, via Michael Gehlken of the Dallas Morning News. \u201cPeriod. I really know that. The job is a great job. Now, that\u2019s not implying that I made it that way or I don\u2019t make it that way. It\u2019s just the place to be.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday night, Jones declined to comment on Meyer\u2019s remarks while speaking to Charean Williams of PFT and Clarence E. Hill, Jr. of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. In that same conversation, Jones said that he is \u201clooking for reasons\u201d to keep Jason Garrett, which implies that the reasons to not keep him are hiding in plain sight.\n\nRegardless, Garrett remains in the last year of his contract. Unless and until Jones gives Garrett an extension, the possibility remains that \u201cthe place to be\u201d will be looking for a new head coach in January.", "description": "Urban Meyer recently talked publicly about his interest in coaching the Cowboys.
