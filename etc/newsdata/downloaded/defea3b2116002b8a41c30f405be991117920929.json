But one of the hottest brands going right now is letting just about anyone produce merchandise with its logo on it, for free.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nIt\u2019s NASA.\n\nShirts sporting the abbreviated name of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration have been popular with youths for a few years now, and they\u2019re sold everywhere from JCPenney for $9.74 to Saks Fifth Avenue for $355.\n\nBert Ulrich, a multimedia liaison at NASA, said the administration is experiencing a \u201cgolden age of interest,\u201d thanks in part to social media posts that show off great photos from the Hubble Space Telescope, the Mars Curiosity Rover and astronauts on the International Space Station.\n\n\u201cPeople get really excited about it,\u201d he said.\n\nAt Target, which carries a variety of NASA \"merch\" like T-shirts, hats, socks and swimwear, a company spokesperson said sales of the NASA gear are consistently strong and have long been a guest favorite.\n\n\u201cOur guests love our NASA assortment and believe part of the draw is that the designs evoke feelings of NASA pride, adventure and intrigue,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nBecause NASA is a public agency, it doesn\u2019t have any exclusive licensing agreements; anyone interested in producing NASA-related merchandise gets equal access. It also means that NASA doesn't get a share of sales.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t discriminate against anyone,\u201d Ulrich said.\n\nThat means just about anyone from mom-and-pop shops to major national retailers are welcome to put NASA\u2019s logo on a shirt, as long as they\u2019re willing to follow the administration\u2019s rules. NASA has certain requirements like which colors are used, and its logos can\u2019t be used in conjunction with another logo to suggest \u201cco-branding.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite an easy process,\u201d Ulrich said.\n\nBut NASA does \u201cvery rarely\u201d turn some people down, according to Ulrich. Use of the logos is limited mostly to souvenir items like apparel and notepads. Someone couldn\u2019t come along and sell computers with the NASA logo on them to imply they\u2019d been made by the space agency, he said.\n\nThere are two main logos that NASA allows to be used on merchandise: the \u201cmeatball,\u201d the blue circle with red and white stylizing that was the administration\u2019s original logo and has been its main insignia again since 1992, and the \u201cworm,\u201d the logotype used as NASA\u2019s primary logo from 1976 to 1992.\n\nIt used to be that NASA received requests for its logos a couple times most weeks, Ulrich said. But that number has increased dramatically since 2017, when officials relaxed the rules to allow the \u201cworm\u201d logo on merch and Coach released its popular \u201cCoach Space\u201d line that prominently featured NASA logos including the \u201cworm.\u201d\n\nNASA now typically receives between 10 and 20 requests to use its logos every day, according to Ulrich.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of crazy,\u201d he said.\n\nClothing producers and shoppers aren\u2019t the only ones showing increased interest in NASA. Ulrich said he\u2019s also seen an increase in requests from Hollywood for space-focused movies like \u201cGravity,\u201d \u201cThe Martian\u201d and \u201cAd Astra.\u201d NASA also participated in a record 174 documentaries last year.\n\nAll the interest on social media and in the entertainment industry \u201chas sort of exploded in our pop-cultural consciousness,\u201d Ulrich said.\n\n\u201cInterest in NASA and our missions has really blossomed,\u201d he said.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "One of the hottest brands going right now is letting just about anyone produce merchandise with its logo on it, for free.", "authors": ["James Leggate"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/458841main_2010-3416.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
