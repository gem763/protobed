And he died in a vicious and violent way, as a coward, running and crying.\"\n\nThe President was also quick to emphasis his involvement in the military action, while heaping curious praise on ISIS's media department.\n\n\"I've been looking for him for three years. I've been looking for him,\" he added.\n\n\"You know, they use the internet better than almost anybody in the world, perhaps other than Donald Trump .\"\n\nQuestions have been raised about how Trump could go into such detail, given that the video stream beamed to the White House was taken from an overhead aircraft.", "description": "Relative of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Mohammed Ali Sajet, claims the terror group buried gold, cash and silver in the Iraqi desert", "authors": ["Milo Boyd", "Image", "Yahya Nemah Epa-Efe Rex", "Al-Furqan Media Afp Via Getty Im", "Anadolu Agency Via Getty Images", "Al-Arabiya", "Maxar Handout Epa-Efe Rex", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Reuters", "Instagram"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20734614.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_FILES-IRAQ-CONFLICT-BAGHDADI-IS.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
