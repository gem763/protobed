Or the Ukrainians could defy Trump and face the wrath of a president who had frozen $250 million of crucial military assistance for mysterious reasons before releasing it earlier this month.\n\nEither way, they risk cracking the bipartisan consensus that has firmly supported Ukraine against Russia since 2014, when the Kremlin annexed Ukraine\u2019s Crimea region and stoked war in Ukraine\u2019s east. If Ukraine becomes associated with one U.S. political party or the other, it could jeopardize ties with its most important security backer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a diplomatic disaster for our relations with the United States,\u201d said Alyona Getmanchuk, the director of the New Europe Center, a Kiev-based foreign policy think tank. \u201cI don\u2019t know what could be the way out of this story.\u201d\n\nThe predicament could come to a head Wednesday, when Trump is to sit down, for the first time, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.\n\nZelensky has sought the meeting for months, seeing it as a way to demonstrate U.S. support for a country that is still fighting a war in its east and enduring Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea. Trump has been reluctant, and he pressed Zelensky about Biden in a July phone conversation that is the subject of an extraordinary intelligence community whistleblower complaint.\n\nIn an interview with Ukrainian television station Hromadske that aired on Saturday, Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko denied that Trump had pressured Zelensky during the phone call.\n\n\u201cI know what the conversation was about, and I think there was no pressure,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was talk, conversations are different, leaders have the right to discuss any problems that exist. This conversation was long, friendly, and it touched on a lot of questions, including those requiring serious answers.\u201d\n\nDiplomats, politicians and analysts inside and outside Ukraine said Saturday that Ukraine was in a precarious position.\n\n\u201cReally couldn\u2019t get worse\u201d for Kiev, said a senior European diplomat, speaking on the condition of anonymity to avoid aggravating the situation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid to do even more harm to Ukraine,\u201d said a normally gregarious former policymaker, turning down a request for comment.\n\n\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky plans to meet with President Trump this week during the United Nations General Assembly in New York City.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nZelensky \u2014 who until recently was a comedian with no political experience \u2014 will have to tread carefully. A misstep could further inflame the situation in Washington, costing Ukraine its ties either to Republican or Democratic lawmakers.\n\nSince Trump has embraced Russian President Vladimir Putin and questioned both NATO and the reasons to support Ukraine, the bipartisan backing for the country in Congress has come to represent the main U.S. security guarantee for Kiev. If that were eroded, Ukraine could be in an especially dangerous position.\n\n\u201cOur vital interest is to ensure and to protect and to strengthen the bipartisan support for Ukraine,\u201d said Danylo Lubkivsky, a former Ukrainian deputy foreign minister. \u201cThis is not all about Ukraine. Don\u2019t impose some domestic issues, problems on Ukraine, while Ukraine fights against Russia\u2019s aggression and struggles for its independence and freedom.\u201d\n\n[Trump\u2019s freeze on Ukraine aid draws new scrutiny amid push for Biden investigation]\n\nZelensky is also talking about meeting with Putin as well as with the leaders of France and Germany in the coming weeks to try to hammer out a settlement to the conflict that is in its fifth year. That makes the uproar in Washington especially unsettling, because it weakens Ukraine\u2019s negotiating position.\n\nZelensky has been more open to Russia than his predecessor, negotiating a major prisoner swap with the Kremlin in addition to suggesting discussions with Putin.\n\n\u201cThe ultimate beneficiary of all this story is Russia,\u201d said Daria Kaleniuk, the executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, a clean-governance organization in Kiev.\n\nAlready, some Ukrainians worry that Zelensky may have offered too much to Trump\u2019s team.\n\n\u201cJust stay away from it. It is not our story. There is nothing to gain, there is lots to lose,\u201d said Victoria Voytsitska, a former Ukrainian lawmaker who was swept into office in 2014 in a wave of Western-oriented activists who entered politics after the political upheavals that year.\n\nUsing an investigation \u201cas a tool to say we\u2019re reopening this to provide a benefit, leverage to a particular candidate, would be a mistake,\u201d she said.\n\nUkrainian policymakers and analysts worry that their leader is walking into an ambush by meeting Trump on Wednesday. They fear it could set back efforts to improve the rule of law made since the 2014 revolution, which overthrew a deeply corrupt leader.\n\nOne irony is that U.S. resources have been poured into Ukraine since its 1991 independence from the Soviet Union to try to foster an independent judiciary, one that could stand up to political pressure \u2014 the exact sort of pressure Trump is now applying, Getmanchuk said.\n\nCapitulating \u201cwould be a disrespect to all the Americans who gave funds and investment from U.S. taxpayers for 28 years for reforms,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nA pro-Russian rally in front of the Crimean parliament building in Simferpol, Crimea, in March 2014, ahead of a referendum that endorsed Crimean secession from Ukraine and union with Russia.

Giuliani followed up with an in-person meeting with Andriy Yermak, a top Zelensky aide, in Madrid, Giuliani said. Giuliani said that he met with Yermak to suggest two matters for investigation and that Yermak indicated the Ukrainians were open to pursuing the investigations. Yermak did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n[How Trump and Giuliani pressured Ukraine to investigate the president\u2019s rivals]\n\nThe first matter concerned allegations that Ukraine\u2019s government colluded with Democrats in 2016 to try to derail Trump\u2019s presidential bid.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, the release of a ledger documenting millions of dollars of off-books payments from the former Ukrainian government to Paul Manafort helped lead to Manafort\u2019s ouster as Trump\u2019s campaign chairman. Manafort had been a consultant to Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, the Russia-friendly leader who was forced to resign in 2014.\n\nGiuliani said that the release of that information was part of a coordinated campaign by the Ukrainian government to help Democrats. He offered no evidence.\n\nSerhiy Leshchenko, the Ukrainian lawmaker who revealed the ledger, says he released the information to try to fight corruption in Ukraine, not intervene in U.S. politics.\n\nThe second matter raised by Giuliani involved a probe of the Ukrainian gas tycoon who put Hunter Biden on the board of his company Burisma.\n\n\n\nViktor Shokin (Sergei Chuzavkov/AP)\n\nIn 2016, then-Vice President Biden demanded the ouster of Ukraine\u2019s top law enforcement official, Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin.\n\nTrump and Giuliani have accused the elder Biden of pushing for Shokin\u2019s dismissal to protect Hunter Biden from an investigation into Burisma.\n\nBut it is unclear how seriously Shokin was pursuing Burisma at the time he was forced out. Diplomats said at the time that Shokin\u2019s ouster was tied to Western worries about corruption in Ukraine\u2019s justice system. Washington\u2019s concerns were widely shared by Ukraine\u2019s European partners, and they embraced Shokin\u2019s departure.\n\n\u201cThe Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, want to stay as far away as possible from the Joe Biden demand that the Ukrainian Government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son,\u201d Trump wrote Saturday on Twitter.\n\nBiden said Saturday that he had never spoken with his son about his business in Ukraine and accused Trump of \u201cdoing this because he knows I will beat him like a drum.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nTrump pressed Ukrainian leader to probe Biden\u2019s son, say people familiar with the matter\n\nTrump defends call with Ukrainian president, calling it \u2018perfectly fine and routine\u2019\n\nAs vice president, Biden said Ukraine should increase gas production. Then his son got a job with a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Demands by Trump and his allies for Biden probe leave Kiev looking for way out of \u2018diplomatic disaster.\u2019", "authors": ["Michael Birnbaum", "Brussels Bureau Chief Covering Europe", "David L.
