There, past piles of empty beehives, on a wall of metal shelves, were stacks of wooden disks \u2014 all that remains of 39 trees taken down in 2014 from Great Mountain Forest in the northwest corner of the state.\n\nThese cross-sections of tree trunks, known as stem disks \u2014 or more informally as cookies \u2014 are telling a potentially worrisome tale about the ability of forests to be critical hedges against accelerating climate change. As anyone following the fires burning in the Amazon rainforest knows by now, trees play an important role in helping to offset global warming by storing carbon from atmospheric carbon dioxide \u2014 a major contributor to rising temperatures \u2014 in their wood, leaves, and roots. The worldwide level of CO2 is currently averaging more than 400 parts per million \u2014 the highest amount by far in the last 800,000 years.\n\nBut Marra, a forest pathologist at the Experiment Station with a Ph.D. in plant pathology from Cornell University, has documented from studying his fallen trees that internal decay has the capacity to significantly reduce the amount of carbon stored within.\n\nHis research, published in Environmental Research Letters late last year and funded by the National Science Foundation, focused on a technique to see inside trees \u2014 a kind of scan known as tomography (the \u201cT\u201d in CAT scan.) This particular tomography was developed for use by arborists to detect decay in urban and suburban trees, mainly for safety purposes. Marra, however, may be the first to deploy it for measuring carbon content and loss associated with internal decay. Where there is decay there is less carbon, he explains, and where there is a cavity, there is no carbon at all.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re suggesting is that internal decay in trees has just not been properly accounted for,\u201d says Marra.\n\nWhile the first round of his research was a proof of concept that necessitated the destruction of 39 trees to show that tomography is accurate, his ultimate goal is a nondestructive technique to enable better assessments of carbon sequestration than those done annually by the U.S. Forest Service. Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, ratified in 1994, governments are required to report annual estimates of carbon holdings in all their managed lands. The most recent Forest Service figures show that U.S. forests offset about 14 percent of the nation\u2019s carbon emissions each year.\n\nThe Forest Service estimates that carbon makes up 48 to 50 percent of a tree\u2019s biomass, so ones with decay will be less dense and therefore hold less carbon. But Marra contends that the visual signs monitored by the Forest Service, such as canopy and tree size, along with conspicuous problems such as lesions or cankers, don\u2019t accurately reflect internal decay \u2014 a tree that looks healthy may have decay and one that appears problematic may be fine inside.\n\nIn addition, he says, foresters typically use a mallet to hammer a tree to register a sound that might indicate it\u2019s hollow. \u201cYou know that there may be a hollow, but you don\u2019t know how big the hollow is,\u201d Marra says. As a result, he believes the government\u2019s baseline data used to estimate carbon storage are not accurate.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of ways to improve our estimates of carbon being stored above ground in forests, and this decay component could certainly prove to be important,\u201d says Andrew Reinmann, an ecologist and biogeochemist with the City University of New York\u2019s Advanced Science Research Center. But, he added, \u201cWe haven\u2019t really had the technology to explore this before \u2014 it\u2019s still a little bit of an unknown.\u201d\n\nMARRA USED a two-stage system for his research: sonic tomography, which sends sound waves through the tree, followed by electrical resistance tomography, which transmits an electric current. Both processes are necessary to fine-tune each other\u2019s readings.\n\nThe system, which costs about $25,000 and fits in a backpack, is cheap and small by scientific equipment standards. Each reading takes no more than a few minutes and computerized visual renderings of the results appear instantly.\n\nMarra experimented with three northern hardwoods \u2014 sugar maple, yellow birch, and American beech \u2014 and included more than two dozen of each, along with some control trees with no decay. The researchers analyzed the lower bole \u2014 the first two meters or so \u2014 of each tree, which is the oldest part and closest to the soil, where most decay-causing fungi would come from.\n\nA dozen or so nails were tapped in a circle around the trunk and connected by cables to the tomograph; a sonic hammer then activated the system to get sound-wave measurements.\n\nFor the electric resistance tomography, a second set of nails was hammered between the first, and electrodes \u2014 plus and minus \u2014 were attached to each.\n\nThe various nail areas were painted in different colors to enable the computer renderings to be aligned later with photographs of the cookies after the trees were cut down.\n\nThe cookies, about 4 inches thick and which Marra called \u201cthe truth,\u201d were only taken from where the measurements were made \u2014 the areas with the paint markings.\n\nHe analyzed 105 cookies from the 39 trees taken down. In the 11 cases where tomography found no decay, the cookies revealed only one small cavity. In the 32 cases where incipient, or early, decay was detected, the cookies showed one additional cavity. The cookies confirmed the tomography results in 36 cases where active decay was found, though eight small cavities were also detected. Tomography correctly identified cavities in the remaining 26 cookies, meaning that it missed a total of 10 cavities among the 105 cookies.\n\n\u201cOne thing to sort of mitigate against this failure, if you want to call it that \u2014 these were very small cavities,\u201d Marra says of the ones the tomography missed. \u201cSo they would have very little impact on a carbon budget.\u201d\n\nThen came the time-consuming process of measuring the actual amount of carbon in each tree. After air-drying the cookies for a year, the wood from 500 drilled holes was sent to a gas chromatography lab at the University of Massachusetts to determine the carbon levels.\n\nThe tomography and lab results were then combined to calculate how much carbon was stored in the lower boles and to contrast that with the levels if the trees had been solid wood. Those calculations took until 2017 to complete.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking at anywhere from a 19 percent to a 34 percent carbon loss\u201d for an actively decaying tree among those studied, Marra says. \u201cBut any place there\u2019s a cavity you\u2019ve lost all of your carbon.\u201d\n\nTHE UPSHOT of his five years of research, says Marra, is that accurate tomographic readings are possible in just a few minutes. \u201cAnd what our tomography tells us is the carbon content,\u201d he says.\n\nAt the same time, Marra is aware that tomography is not a practical substitute for the Forest Service\u2019s carbon estimate system \u2014 which itself is a clunky and labor-intensive slog. But it could provide a valuable way to augment those estimates.\n\n\u201cThose are very, very impressive results,\u2019\u2019 says Kevin Griffin, a tree physiologist at Columbia University and its Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. \u201cThey obviously have obtained a lot of precision in the techniques.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe results are important,\u201d he adds, \u201cbut whether internal tree decay is the single most burning question? Probably not. There\u2019s probably bigger fish to fry before we get there.\u201d\n\nAmong them, he says are forest growth rates and overall tree health and age, as well as the impact of harvesting and other kinds of losses, including disease.\n\nA tree\u2019s architecture and height could also play large roles in carbon sequestration, says Reinmann of the City University of New York\u2019s Advanced Science Research Center, as could the makeup of the forest landscape. His own research, for instance, found trees grow faster and have more biomass at the edge of fragmented forest.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re making a good point that we\u2019re probably over-estimating\u201d carbon storage levels, says Aaron Weiskittel, director of the University of Maine\u2019s Center for Research on Sustainable Forests.\n\nEven so, Weiskittel and others \u2014 including Marra \u2014 say the research needs to be scaled up to many more tree types and full forests. For his part, Marra would like to sample forests randomly with many more trees and controlling for factors including species, age, and soil characteristics.\n\nThe goal, he says, is to develop a methodology for generating data to provide better carbon estimates for more than three tree types in one small part of the country.\n\n\u201cWe need to use tomography to refine models so we\u2019re more accurately assessing the role that forests are playing as sequesterers or climate change mitigators,\u201d Marra says. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be over-estimating the roles that they play.\u201d\n\nJan Ellen Spiegel is a freelance writer and editor based in Connecticut.
