They're incredibly damning, aren't they? But everybody deserves the presumption of innocence. Innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. And by the way I will not deviate from that.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHannity also noted the outlook for McCabe was bleak.\n\n\"It looks bad.
