Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) said. \"Their strategy of stonewalling and obstruction is significantly counterproductive and frankly puts them in further legal peril \u2014 not only the president but his minions.\"\n\nBut Trump\u2019s anti-impeachment offensive \u2014 a mix of legal, political and personal attacks, some logical and some simply bombastic \u2014 poses a real challenge for Democrats. Nearly three years into Trump\u2019s presidency, lawmakers are still trying to figure out how to respond to a president who knows few, if any, limits on his behavior or rhetoric.\n\nTrump has long resisted Democrats\u2019 investigations, routinely ignoring subpoenas for documents and witness testimony and exposing the inherent weaknesses of Congress\u2019 oversight powers.\n\nEven as Democrats have moved into a new investigative phase with their rapidly advancing impeachment inquiry, Trump has shown no signs of letting up, ensuring the constitutional clash will only ratchet up.\n\nINTERACTIVE: See where House lawmakers stand on impeachment\n\nStill, Democrats believe their case against the president over the Ukraine scandal, this time, is unassailable \u2014 a controversy that even Republicans can't ignore. And it\u2019s reinforced not only by closed-door testimony by senior officials, but by Trump\u2019s own comments from the White House lawn.\n\n\u201cYou saw when he stood out there and tried to say, not only should Ukraine investigate, but China should,\u201d said Rep. John Yarmuth (D-Ky.). \u201cI don't think there\u2019s any question we\u2019ve got him on the run at this point.\u201d\n\nThe proof, Democrats say, is in the polling figures that are rapidly rising in favor of impeachment. Two separate polls released Tuesday by The Washington Post and Quinnipiac showed a significant uptick in public support for impeachment, including among independents and Republicans, with a majority in favor of Democrats\u2019 inquiry.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the polling, we\u2019ve so far kept the momentum going,\u201d Yarmuth said.\n\nBut Democrats acknowledge that they have for years failed to pin down Trump. For every seemingly career-ending scandal of his presidency \u2014 including damning findings in the Mueller report, hush money payments to an adult-film actress and Playboy model and numerous accusations of self-dealing \u2014 public sentiment has barely budged.\n\n\"It\u2019s not that it\u2019s difficult to message against him,\" one Democratic aide said. \"What\u2019s difficult is that he\u2019s obviously the president, so whatever he says is quoted as the headline. That\u2019s the difficult part.\"\n\nYet the Ukraine scandal is different, Democrats insist. The controversy is clear \u2014 Trump abused the power of his office for political gain \u2014 and there\u2019s more than enough evidence that is already public.\n\nEven with the White House stonewalling, Democrats have been making progress in investigative work \u2014 securing testimony from three people central to the Ukraine controversy in two weeks. And lawmakers say they expect more news leaks as it becomes evident how many people at senior levels of government were disturbed by Trump\u2019s call.\n\nThe White House itself has also released some information on the president\u2019s July 25 call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Trump\u2019s efforts \u2014 along with those of his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and other officials \u2014 to pressure Ukrainian officials to dig up dirt on Biden while withholding U.S. aid.\n\nActing Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified before the House Intelligence Committee and defended the rights of an anonymous whistleblower to come forward; the Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson also backed up the whistleblower's actions. Since then, a second whistleblower has reportedly emerged as well.\n\nAnd Trump was unable to stop politically damaging text messages from being revealed by former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker that raise the question of whether there was a \"quid pro quo\" between the Ukrainians launching a Biden probe and receiving the U.S. aid. Volker denied that link in his own testimony.\n\nStill, there have been setbacks. The White House has refused to comply with several Democratic subpoenas or requests for testimony, including from Giuliani, Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and the latest, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, a key figure in the scandal.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201910/1769/1155968404_6093168535001_6093165840001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nDemocrats say they won\u2019t be deterred by the administration\u2019s blockade.\n\n\u201cImpeachment grows more likely every day, and every act of obstruction and defiance by the executive branch becomes part of the issue of obstruction, which, itself, is a count for impeachment. They really are digging their own ditch,\u201d said Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), who sits on the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nBut lawmakers also fear the takeaways from their hard-fought investigations could be buried with a single Trump tweet if they don\u2019t stay focused.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to show extreme message discipline in talking about this explosive narrative,\u201d Raskin said.\n\nTrump and GOP congressional leaders, meanwhile, have ramped up their attacks against Democrats and the impeachment inquiry itself.\n\nTrump called it a \"kangaroo court\" on Tuesday in explaining why he wouldn't let Sondland testify before Congress. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has slammed Pelosi for rejecting calls for a full House vote to authorize the impeachment inquiry, which took place during the Nixon and Clinton impeachments.\n\nTrump has also gone on Twitter to rant against Pelosi, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, the anonymous whistleblower and even GOP Sen. Mitt Romney, who dared to \"raise concerns\" about Trump's interactions with Ukrainian officials. Trump called Romney a \"pompous ass,\" and implausibly suggested the Utah Republican should be impeached.\n\nDemocratic leaders have been careful not to hit back at Trump for every Twitter attack. Instead, Pelosi and her top deputies have urged their caucus to keep the message squarely focused on what they see as a clear abuse of power and attempt to undermine U.S. elections.\n\n\u201c[Trump\u2019s] snubbing his nose at the vision of our founders, his disloyalty to the Constitution is something we have to study, and it's just with the facts,\u201d Pelosi said at an event in Washington State on Tuesday. \u201cThe facts and the Constitution, that's what it's about. It's not about any other disagreement you may have in an election.\u201d\n\nIn a conference call last week, Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries encouraged lawmakers to use \u201crepetition,\u201d relying on six key words \u2014 \u201cbetrayal, abuse of power, national security\u201d \u2014 to hammer their point to the public.\n\n\u201cThe challenge won\u2019t be how do we keep this in the public mind,\u201d Connolly said. \u201cHe is so overreacting, and badly, to these developments that I think even if we were to go dark \u2014 which we won\u2019t \u2014 he won\u2019t.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/58/7a/9e0b0e184598bbe2b3e3d8451f56/20191008-nancy-pelosi-capitol-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
