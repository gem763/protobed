REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/File Photo\n\nMONTREAL (Reuters) - Two severely ill and handicapped Canadians can ask for immediate help in ending their lives, a court in the province of Quebec ruled on Wednesday, in a judgment that deemed parts of the country\u2019s existing laws governing physician-assisted suicide as unconstitutional.\n\nQuebec Superior Court Judge Christine Baudouin sided with Jean Truchon, 51, and Nicole Gladu, 73, who are both in severe pain and have incurable medical conditions. The two argued that laws governing eligibility for assisted suicide were too restrictive by limiting access to those facing \u201cforeseeable death.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, Canada decided to allow assisted suicide under certain circumstances.\n\nThe rule which limits access to those close to death \u201cinfringes the plaintiffs\u2019 fundamental rights,\u201d the decision said.\n\nTruchon is almost completely paralyzed because of a childhood disease, while Gladu suffers a degenerative disease after surviving polio as a child.\n\n\u201cI am extremely happy for the two plaintiffs,\u201d said Georges L\u2019Esp\u00e9rance, president of the right to die advocacy group, l\u2019Association qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise pour le droit de mourir dans la dignit\u00e9.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s most important is that they have the right to a seek a medically assisted death, even if they are not at the end of their lives.\u201d\n\nThe decision allows Gladu and Truchon to apply for physician-assisted death immediately while giving Quebec and the federal government six months to change the criteria before suspending that provision of the law.\n\n\u201cCanada is reviewing the decision and will carefully consider the most appropriate next steps,\u201d the federal justice department said in a statement.", "description": "Two severely ill and handicapped Canadians can ask for immediate help in ending their lives, a court in the province of Quebec ruled on Wednesday, in a judgment that deemed parts of the country's existing laws governing physician-assisted suicide as unconstitutional.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428822019&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A1UK-OCADN", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
