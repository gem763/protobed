In part, yes. But as Dick Davis reminds us in his book\u2019s 60-page introduction, until recently women in that part of the world were considered strictly amateur, not professional, poets. Unlike a Hafez or Rumi, they weren\u2019t involved in what our own contemporaries call po-biz. They didn\u2019t live off the largesse of royal patrons or recite their work in bazaars. These educated wives and daughters read and composed poetry because it enriched their lives.\n\nIn general, the lyrics chosen by Davis, especially those from before the 1800s, are short, intimate and usually addressed to one person or a small circle of friends. In some cases, the poems express what seem to be truly personal cris de coeur, even if the imagery employed \u2014 gardens, the breeze at dawn, tears, wine and roses \u2014 is as conventional as that found in a Petrarchan sonnet or a Japanese haiku. As with so much confessional poetry, old or new, the eternal themes are love, longing, loneliness and loss.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne might add lasciviousness to that list of L\u2019s. During several easygoing regimes, the court women \u2014 especially in the 16th century \u2014 could be astonishingly forthright, even bawdy. Their poems recall nights of adulterous passion, hint at same-sex desires, complain about the impotence of elderly husbands. Their words leave nothing veiled, as in this four-line outburst by the 15th-century Mehri, \u201can answer to an old man who proposed himself as her lover\u201d:\n\nGood God, what do you think my flesh is? What?\n\nIt\u2019s handsome men I fancy, young and hot!\n\nIf I liked weak old men, why would I whine\n\nAbout the one that I\u2019ve already got?\n\nA daughter of the Moghul emperor Babur, Golbadan Beigum (1523-1603) sounds as cheekily epigrammatic as Dorothy Parker: Be sure that girls who treat their lovers badly/ Are apt to find their lives will end up sadly.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThen there\u2019s the 14th-century princess Jahan Malek Khatun, whose work Davis previously introduced in \u201cFaces of Love: Hafez and the Poets of Shiraz\u201d:\n\nI swore I\u2019d never look at him again,\n\nI\u2019d be a Sufi, deaf to sin\u2019s temptations;\n\nI saw my nature wouldn\u2019t stand for it\u2014\n\nFrom now on I renounce renunciations.\n\nAt several times, alas, greater Persia reverted to extreme Islamic austerity. Girls were then kept illiterate, married off at 15 to men three times their age and forced to hide their faces in public. Eventually, regime change led to the lessening of some restrictions, so that the early 19th-century poet Mastureh Kurdi can brassily write: \u201cI\u2019d give the world\u2019s wealth for a drop of wine \u2014/ I\u2019d give both worlds, and throw in Judgment Day.\u201d A poem by one of her contemporaries named Gowhar spins variations on the leitmotif phrase \u201clast night.\u201d It ends: \u201cGowhar, he gave your heart\u2019s desire and took your soul\u2014/ My love can\u2019t say the bargain wasn\u2019t fair, last night.\u201d Yet another poet of the same period, Gowhar Beigum Azerbaijani, neatly summarizes her impressive erotic power: \u201cOne glance of mine will make two hundred men/ Whom death has taken, come to life again.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBy the 20th century, Iranian women \u2014 like women in the West \u2014 began to demand greater freedoms. Called her country\u2019s first feminist poet, Alam Taj lived from 1883 to 1947 and composed her poems in secret; they were only discovered after her death. In one, she describes her loathed husband\u2019s whiskers against her skin as feeling, in a highly surrealistic image, \u201clike a tiny knife inserted in an eyeball\u2019s pupil.\u201d\n\nToday, some of Iran\u2019s more outspoken poets have gone into exile. Others, like Simin Behbahani, have been prevented from leaving the country. Twice nominated for the Nobel Prize, Behbahani \u2014 who died in 2014 \u2014 is here represented by six poems, starting with \u201cProstitute\u2019s Song,\u201d which details the horrors of that life. Attention-grabbing in a different way, Sara Ardehali launches \u201cA Full-Time Position\u201d with distinctly comic understatement: \u201cNo man wants/ to fall in love with a woman/ Who works in a circus.\u201d The very last poet represented, Fatemeh Ekhtesari, was born in 1986 and she\u2019s anything but modest and retiring:\n\nI was knocked up and made pregnant\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBy a right-wing political bore\n\nWhen the dust had settled he\u2019d left me\n\nAs if I were a whore.\n\nAs well as being an admired poet in his own right, Dick Davis is widely regarded as our leading translator from Persian. Every page of \u201cThe Mirror of My Heart\u201d shows why, whether through the limpid beauty of the poems themselves or in his command of a diction that ranges from the elegant to the slangy. One poem, by the late 18th-century Maluli, slowly drains all the country-and-western heartbreak from the refrain, \u201cWhat\u2019s it to you?\u201d When Kasm\u2019i (1883-1923) laments the subordinate condition of women in Iran and her country\u2019s subjection to the West, Davis translates: \u201cIran is famous in the world for her nobility \u2014 / It\u2019s this that makes me think, and gives me hope, and troubles me.\u201d That couplet may seem artlessly catchy, but its cadence must have taken immense patience to get just right.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn every respect, \u201cThe Mirror of My Heart\u201d is outstanding. Reading it one discovers a whole tradition of love poetry, epigram and elegy, movingly brought into English and then beautifully printed and bound by Washington\u2019s own Mage Publishers. Most important now, this anthology reminds us how much we all share the same joys, the same sorrows.\n\nMichael Dirda reviews books each Thursday in Style.\n\nAt 5 p.m. Thursday, Dick Davis will speak at Georgetown University, the Riggs Library 3700 O St. NW.
