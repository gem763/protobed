Last week they were in London, the week before they were at Argestes. This week finds the family traveling back to Logan\u2019s childhood home: Welcome to Dundee, a place that, as Logan mentions in passing to Marcia, used to have much better tap water. The Roys are here to throw Logan a surprise party honoring a piece of plastic that Marcia \u2014 quite rightly \u2014 calls a gravestone. The kids are squabbling over Rhea, Rhea is cozying up to Logan, and Logan is being kept in the dark about the latest shitshow at the fuck factory (everything that went on in cruises). Perhaps the Dundees should\u2019ve remained a plastic award given to the staff of a small paper company in Scranton, Pennsylvania. (Roman\u2019s girlfriend, Tabitha \u2014 quickly becoming my favorite character \u2014 is unranked this week, but can she please stomp in Logan\u2019s office and win it all?) Here\u2019s where we stand after \u201cDundee.\u201d\n\nThe Sand in Sands\n\nThe drama around the sand in Willa\u2019s play \u2014 apparently titled Sands \u2014 is the best thing this episode could have offered me. Who doesn\u2019t love a little Off Broadway chaos? Here\u2019s what we know about the sand in Sands: It is construction sand, not beach sand, as Willa asked for. Connor bought nine metric tons, at $529 per bag. It\u2019s beset by sand mites. Sand stans, rise up! I\u2019d like to see the Big Little Lies sand have this kind of impact.\n\nJames in Accounting\n\nCruises presents: a whistle-blower! He knows about shadow logs, NDAs, and secret payments, and he\u2019s willing to talk. I\u2019ve long thought the cruises thing would actually push everything over the edge, and James might be the person to make that happen. Will he go on TV? Whose deep pockets are backing him?\n\nShiv Roy\n\nMy daughter Shiv\u2019s sights are set on destroying Rhea, and that is not a bad idea. Shiv is smart to play the long game: Instead of whining to Logan about how Rhea screwed her, she\u2019s planting landmines poised to go off at Rhea\u2019s every move. \u201cWe need to fuck her from a hundred different directions at a thousand miles an hour,\u201d she tells her brothers. Once the family makes it to Logan\u2019s plaque party, a plum opportunity presents itself and Shiv capitalizes: Let Rhea take the reins for a little bit, especially as the cruise shit is about to hit the Roys\u2019 gilded fan. That\u2019s a storm Shiv doesn\u2019t need to weather, and she\u2019s smart to outsource it.\n\nEwan Roy\n\nEwan Roy and Greta Thunberg, legends link the fuck up! Ewan doesn\u2019t like what his brother has done to this planet, so he\u2019s threatening to pull Cousin Greg\u2019s inheritance if he doesn\u2019t quit Waystar. But am I wrong to smell another trick under Ewan\u2019s statement sleeves? Could his one-liners tease that he\u2019s the deep pocket behind the whistle-blower?\n\nMarcia Roy\n\n\u201cAre you regularly tested for sexually transmitted diseases?\u201d Marcia Roy asks the woman fucking her husband. \u201cHe and I still sleep together. I don\u2019t know what he tells you,\u201d she finishes. This! Scene! This! Moment! Let me tell you whose husband Miss Rhea Jarrell won\u2019t be stealing: Marcia\u2019s! The height difference and tight shot is sensational here: Marcia will let Logan have his fun, but she won\u2019t be trifled with. It\u2019s been a rocky season for Marcia, with none of her plans working out as she hoped, and her being cut out of Logan\u2019s scheming. But she knows how to hold her own: fucking with the seemingly straight-laced Rhea by confronting her directly was a chef\u2019s kiss.\n\nLogan Roy\n\nLogan knows the cruise division is a vulnerability, but he doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s a weak spot that\u2019s about to be poked right now. His wife is mad at him, his kids are conspiring against his new girlfriend, he\u2019s in his brother\u2019s crosshairs, and his company might be the subject of another tell-all interview. What does he have instead? A plaque.\n\nGerri Killman\n\nOnce upon a time, Gerri was Logan\u2019s flavor of the month! And today, Gerri is getting a weirdo maybe-marriage proposal from Roman? I\u2019ll say she\u2019s net-neutral. She\u2019s not intimate enough with Logan to be pushed out by the kids, but she\u2019s still in the inner circle.\n\nRoman Roy\n\nHe bought the wrong soccer team. He bought the wrong soccer team! Who buys the wrong soccer team? But also who else is cozy with foreign money?\n\nCousin Greg\n\nPoor Cousin Greg, poor Cousin Greg\u2019s sand-mite bites, poor Cousin Greg saying \u201cGreg-xit.\u201d Greg\u2019s net-neutral too, because he didn\u2019t gain anything, but he also didn\u2019t lose anything. Logan pushes him to stay with \u201cUncle Fun\u201d instead of \u201cGrandpa Grumps,\u201d and Logan is probably right \u2014 Ewan\u2019s not going to cut Cousin Greg out of his will.\n\nKendall Roy\n\nIn Kendall\u2019s favor: that rap. Not in Kendall\u2019s favor: that rap, and also everything else. Kendall Roy saying \u201cflava\u201d \u2014 and in that jersey! \u2014 did rob me of months of my life. Kendall is indecisive about everything and everyone: He wanted to team with Stewy, but then \u201cDad\u2019s plan was better.\u201d He liked Naomi, but oh wait, what about Jennifer? Jennifer says \u201cawesome\u201d too much, though, so maybe he\u2019ll go back to Rava? It\u2019s all a mess. He has the most knowledge of all the Roy kids, but none of the confidence.\n\nConnor Roy\n\n\u201cWatch this space.\u201d \u201cSometimes I think I\u2019ll never understand Dad until I shit outside.\u201d \u201cI bear no legal responsibility. You\u2019ll have to talk to the sand supplier like everyone else.\u201d I love all of Connor\u2019s lines this episode. Unfortunately, he\u2019s still \u2026 himself. Connor is hemorrhaging money on Willa\u2019s dumb-dumb sandbox theater, and that\u2019s the only thing on his mind right now.\n\nRhea Jarrell\n\nLast week, in the key of Whoopi Goldberg in Ghost, I said: \u201cRhea, you in danger girl.\u201d Where does Rhea find herself this week? In danger! My daughter Siobhan is a missile fixed on her target, and Rhea certainly will not make it out alive. She\u2019s slippery and liked by Logan (they\u2019ve been going out to dinner four nights a week!), but Shiv and her brothers have spent their whole lives training to oust this kind of personal attack. They are setting her up for little \u2014 but important \u2014 failures: mentioning Logan\u2019s sister, pitting her against Marcia, pointing out her politics, and that she doesn\u2019t drink. Rhea is squirming, and I personally love to see it. With Shiv squarely positioned against her, Rhea goes around to every brother cooing compliments in their ear. Baby, it\u2019s too late for that!\n\nJennifer\n\nOh, Jennifer. At the beginning of this episode she was an actor with, according to Connor, an \u201cunbelievable gift for \u2026 pretending.\u201d By the end of the episode she\u2019s gone to Dundee and back, and all she\u2019s done is kiss Kendall and say \u201cawesome\u201d a lot. A shame! At least she still has Sands.", "description": "The kids are squabbling over Rhea, Rhea is cozying up to Logan, and Logan\u2019s in his brother\u2019s crosshairs.
