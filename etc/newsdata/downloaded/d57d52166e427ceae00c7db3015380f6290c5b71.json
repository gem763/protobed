It\u2019s so satisfying!\u2019\n\nBet is Paloma\u2019s first on-screen acting role since a one-off part in PG Wodehouse series Blandings in 2013, as she focused on her successful music career.\n\nBut when she decided to return to the screen, the star wanted to shake off her bubbly persona for something a little more dramatic.\n\n\u2018The character I was given, I didn\u2019t know she was a villain, I didn\u2019t know she was a dark character,\u2019 Paloma explained to us.\n\nPaloma\u2019s northern twang appeared straight out of Corrie (Picture: Epix)\n\n\u2018I actually said to my agent, it was quite weird, that what I really wanted to do was the opposite to me as a popstar person. I wanted to be in Mike Leigh films, Ken Loach. Gritty, gritty stuff.\u2019\n\n\u2018I sort of tried to play [Bet] like that. Doing it as if I was in an independent British film about depressing England,\u2019 the star continued.\n\n\u2018It wasn\u2019t really until I started shooting a few weeks before that I kind of realised that [Pennyworth] was a dramatic, hyper-real version of that.\n\nMore: Paloma Faith Paloma Faith is raising her child to be socially conscious: \u2018God knows we need it' Batman spin-off series Pennyworth has a trailer and Gotham fans are in luck Paloma Faith 'threatened to kill neighbour's dog' while in character as Pennyworth killer\n\n\u2018I thought I got it because I was a great subtle actress, but then they were like \u201cno, we picked you because you overact to everything!\u201d,\u2019 she laughed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I thought I was playing the downtrodden, highbrow roles!\u2019\n\nPennyworth premieres in full on 25 October on StarzPlay via Amazon Prime Video.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
