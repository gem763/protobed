The Wallabies, who were made to work by Fiji, won\u2019t be as easy to break down so Gatland\u2019s men will need to seize their opportunities when they arise. They\u2019ll look to target the Aussies with repeated high balls through the boot of Gareth Davies and Liam Williams.\n\nNonetheless, Wales\u2019 set-piece remains a point of vulnerability. If Australia can exploit this aspect of the Welsh game, things might unravel for the 2019 Six Nations champions. Still, I\u2019m confident there\u2019s a lot more to come from Wales, who I\u2019m tipping for a narrow victory.", "description": "Wales\u00a0will be looking to build upon their opening World Cup win over Georgia when they take on Australia\u00a0this weekend.
