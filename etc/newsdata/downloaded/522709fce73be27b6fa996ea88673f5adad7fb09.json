goals from Magomed Ozdoev, Artem Dzyuba and Aleksandr Golovin.\n\nAfter they battered Scotland in Moscow during the week, Russia knew a draw would be good enough in a balmy Cyprus against the only team who could mathematically catch them in second spot in Group I.\n\nManager Stanislav Cherchesov made three changes to the team that hammered the Scots, and one of the those, Valencia winger Cheryshev, opened the scoring inside 10 minutes when he pinched the ball off a dawdling Charalambos Kyriakou in the Cypriot defense before racing clear to finish from a tight angle.\n\n\u041e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u043e \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438. \u0427\u0435\u0440\u044b\u0448\u0435\u0432
