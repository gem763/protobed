He was still feeling tired, but he never knew to what extent this was simply down to the pressures of a stressful job. Over time he began feeling stomach pains, but an endoscopy didn\u2019t reveal anything untoward.\n\nAfter the six-month course of treatment was finished, Jeremy was tested for the virus, and the drugs hadn\u2019t shifted it. \u201cIt was six months of total hell for no reason,\u201d says Liz. Jeremy couldn\u2019t face going back on the medication again. He preferred to live with the risk of liver failure rather than put his family through that a second time.\n\nOn 7 December 2008, the family sat down to breakfast as normal. Lewis, now 15, caught his bus to school. Liz went to the insurance company office where she worked part-time handling claims.\n\nNot long before lunchtime, she was in a meeting when a colleague knocked on the door. The mobile phone she had left on her desk was going off. It was Jeremy. \u201cPlease can you come home?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019m really not very well.\u201d\n\nLiz raced back to the house and called out Jeremy's name as she stepped through the front door. No-one answered. She went upstairs and opened the bathroom door. \u201cIt was absolutely horrific,\u201d she says. There was bright red blood everywhere.\n\nThen she went to the bedroom. Jeremy was lying on the bed, ashen-faced. The colour had drained from his lips. Barely conscious, he told Liz he\u2019d been vomiting blood.\n\nShe rang an ambulance. Paramedics arrived to take him to hospital. He was booked in for an endoscopy to see what was wrong. The next morning, before he went in for the examination, Jeremy told Liz: \u201cRight, I\u2019m going to get this done and then I\u2019m going home and I want to have a hot bath and a big cup of tea with sugar.\u201d He didn\u2019t normally take sugar, only on special occasions, as a treat.\n\nThose were the last words he ever said to Liz.\n\nThe endoscope was put down his throat, but it didn\u2019t get very far before an internal bleed erupted. He then had a cardiac arrest. The medical staff resuscitated him and rushed him into surgery.\n\nA doctor summoned Liz to tell her what had happened. \u201cI knew from his expression what he was going to say,\u201d she recalls. There was nothing they could do. \u201cI still feel ashamed of myself,\u201d Liz says. \u201cI remember getting on the floor in front of the doctor. I held my arms out and I said to him: \u2018Take my blood because if you take my blood, he\u2019ll have it.\u2019\u201d The doctor told her it was too late for that.\n\nThe doctor asked if she wanted to see Jeremy. She did, but she would later deeply regret setting foot inside the operating theatre. There was blood everywhere. \u201cIt was coming out of his mouth and out of his nose and even the corners of his eyes. His body was just rejecting everything.\u201d She couldn\u2019t stay with him. \u201cIt\u2019s a memory that I\u2019ve got etched in my mind and it was just like something from a horror film.\u201d", "description": "Liz loved two men.
