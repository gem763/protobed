While Tony Ferguson is next on the champ's playlist, it's not out of the question that St-Pierre could be injected back into the mix.\n\n\u201cTony Ferguson is the fight that needs to happen,\u201d UFC president Dana White reiterated in comments to TMZ Sports. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to do it four other times, so hopefully we can get it done this time.

Tony\u2019s had opportunities before that he didn\u2019t take, so if he doesn\u2019t, then I would be interested in talking about GSP.\u201d\n\nWhite is still set on Ferguson, but the rocky past when trying to get him and Nurmagomedov in the Octagon together could open the door wide.\n\n\"A (Nurmagomedov vs. McGregor) rematch is possible too, somewhere down the road. Conor would fight somebody else before that. The Ferguson fight would have to happen.\"\n\nCurrently, White remains steadfast in booking Nurmagomedov vs. Ferguson, though there have been no timetables or locations leaked.\n\nTRENDING > Nate Diaz and Jorge Masvidal face off for UFC 244 for the first time (video)\n\nDana White addresses Khabib vs. GSP and Conor McGregor's return\n\nStory continues\n\n(Video courtesy of TMZSports | Viewing may be limited by broadcast rights restrictions)", "description": "UFC lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov has long wanted a superfight with former UFC welterweight and middleweight champion Georges St-Pierre.
