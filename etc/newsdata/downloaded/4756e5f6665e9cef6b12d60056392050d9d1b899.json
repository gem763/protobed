I believe that this issue has made Hong Kong more united.\u201d\n\nThe protests against the bill in the former British colony began in March but snowballed in June and have since evolved into a push for greater democracy.\n\nThe bill would have allowed extraditions to mainland China where courts are controlled by the Communist Party,\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the announcement of the bill\u2019s withdrawal, due later on Wednesday, would help end the unrest.\n\nThe chief executive\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nHong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index .HSI jumped after the report, trading up about 3.4%. The property index also jumped.\n\nThe withdrawal of the draft legislation was one of the protesters\u2019 key demands. Lam has said before that the bill was \u201cdead\u201d but she did not withdraw it.\n\nThe other demands are: the retraction of the word \u201criot\u201d to describe rallies, the release of all arrested demonstrators, an independent inquiry into the police perceived brutality and the right for Hong Kong people to democratically choose their own leaders.\n\nMichael Tien, a member of Hong Kong\u2019s legislature and a deputy to China\u2019s national parliament, said the government should withdraw the bill and that he would support an inquiry commission.\n\n\u201cThe government should withdraw the bill. If the government mentioned (a withdrawal) in June it would have stopped already,\u201d he told reporters, referring to the protests.\n\nHong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam holds a news conference in Hong Kong, China, August 27, 2019. REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach\n\nCHINA\u2019S WARNINGS\n\nHong Kong returned to China under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula that allows it to keep freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland, like the freedom to protest and an independent legal system, hence the anger at the extradition bill and perceived creeping influence by Beijing.\n\nThe Chinese government rejected a recent proposal by Lam to defuse the conflict that included withdrawing the extradition bill altogether, three people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\n\nAsked about the report, China\u2019s foreign ministry said the central government \u201csupports, respects and understands\u201d Lam\u2019s decision to suspend the bill. The Global Times, a nationalistic tabloid published by the Communist Party\u2019s official People\u2019s Daily, denounced it as \u201cfake\u201d.\n\nChina has regularly denounced the protests and warned about the impact on Hong Kong\u2019s economy\n\nChina denies it is meddling in Hong Kong\u2019s affairs but warned again on Tuesday that it would not sit idly by if the unrest threatened Chinese security and sovereignty.\n\nThe unrest had shown no sign of easing by Tuesday night.\n\nRiot police fired beanbag guns and used pepper spray - both anti-riot weapons - to clear demonstrators from outside the Mong Kok police station and in Prince Edward metro station, with one man taken out on a stretcher with an oxygen mask over his face, television footage showed.\n\nVideos showing the man being apprehended by the police in the station have been widely shared on social media with protest groups and activists saying it is evidence of the police brutality they say is widespread and needs to be investigated.\n\nThe police, who have repeatedly denied using excessive force, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
