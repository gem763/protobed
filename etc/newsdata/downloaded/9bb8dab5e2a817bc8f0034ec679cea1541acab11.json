Its subsidiary True North Foods sells a line of packaged seafood meals in partnership with lifestyle guru Martha Stewart. The company\u2019s sustainability policy includes a pledge to raise \u201cfish with optimal care and consideration of animal welfare practices\u201d.\n\nCampaigners said animal welfare was disregarded at the Cooke facility in Maine. They said the video shows some of the salmon at the farm suffered from spinal deformities, and that some had fungus growth eating away at their faces. Workers also slammed and stomped on the fish, COK said.\n\n\u201cI watched as their bodies were slammed into the ground over and over,\u201d said COK\u2019s undercover investigator in an interview with the Guardian, who got a job at Cooke\u2019s Maine hatchery earlier this year. \u201cI saw their scales ripped from their bodies due to the friction.\u201d\n\nAre we wrong to assume fish can't feel pain?

However, COK has filed a legal complaint with the animal welfare unit of Maine\u2019s department of agriculture, alleging animal abuse.\n\nA spokesperson for the department said it had received a complaint and was investigating. Cooke also confirmed that it had met with officials from the Maine Department of Agriculture to discuss the complaint.\n\nA growing body of research suggests that fish possess high cognitive functioning, and have prolonged reactions to painful stimuli.\n\nIn 2009, the European Union\u2019s former health commissioner Androulla Vassiliou said that there is \u201csufficient scientific evidence indicating that fish are sentient beings and that they are subject to pain and suffering\u201d.\n\nAquaculture industry certification groups like Best Aquaculture Practices promote animal health and welfare standards. The National Aquaculture Association, the leading industry group in the US, also promotes quick slaughter and other humane practices.\n\nIn a statement posted on Cooke\u2019s website, the company\u2019s CEO said: \u201cIt appears that unacceptable fish handling incidents have occurred at the Bingham hatchery. These are not our standards and will not continue.\u201d\n\nHe also announced that Cooke \u201cwill institute a rigorous re-training program\u201d at the Maine facility. \u201cI am very sorry that this has happened,\u201d he said. \u201cWe understand that animal health and welfare are an important piece of raising animals.\u201d\n\nIn response to the video footage, the National Aquaculture Association said it did not support or condone malicious acts of animal abuse.\n\n\n\n\u201cSuccessful farming depends upon healthy animals and conscientious care. Animal abuse must be immediately reported to farm owners and/or managers or to public authorities when farm managers are unresponsive to reports of mistreatment in a timely manner,\u201d it said in a public statement.\n\n\n\nAquaculture accounts for half the global fish production. As wild fish stocks decline, aquaculture production will need to double by 2050, according to a report by the World Resources Institute that found that industrial fish farms are already rapidly expanding, despite risks that they can spread disease and pollute the ocean.\n\nThe US is a minor aquaculture producer, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and was ranked 16th in 2016 on a global scale.\n\n", "description": "Campaigners say animal welfare was disregarded at a salmon hatchery run by Cooke, one of the world\u2019s largest seafood companies, in Maine", "authors": ["Maanvi Singh"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48f1a950e3559a5f80527e065504fd66f93cf861/213_0_2032_1219/master/2032.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9495a7cabbcd4214032838980f9cb7a4", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
