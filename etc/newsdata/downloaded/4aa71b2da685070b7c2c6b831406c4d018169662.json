Janet Mills signed LD 179 into law, replacing Columbus Day in Maine with \u201cIndigenous Peoples\u2019 Day.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur history is by no means perfect,\u201d Mills said in a statement as she was joined by tribal leaders at the signing of the legislation into law. \u201cBut, for too long, it has been written and presented in a way that fails to acknowledge our shortcomings.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, we take another step in healing the divisions of the past, in fostering inclusiveness, in telling a fuller, deeper history, and in bringing the State and Maine\u2019s tribal communities together to build a future shaped by mutual trust and respect,\u201d the governor added.\n\nThe Maine State Museum lists resources to guide discussion about the name change, including those offered by the Zinn Education Project\u2019s Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day \u2014 based on socialist Howard Zinn\u2019s A People\u2019s History of the United States that has sold more than 2.5 million copies and has been offered as \u201chistory\u201d in public schools for decades.\n\nThe Zinn Education Project says it provides \u201clessons, books, and films for teaching the truth about Columbus and Indigenous Peoples history.\u201d\n\nThe project refers readers to a book titled Rethinking Columbus, edited by Bill Bigelow and Bob Peterson, that asserts Christopher Columbus should be revisited \u201cbecause the Columbus myth is a foundation of children\u2019s beliefs about society.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe murky legend of a brave adventurer tells children whose version of history to accept, and whose to ignore,\u201d a summary states. \u201cIt says nothing about the brutality of the European invasion of North America.\u201d\n\nHowever, in Debunking Howard Zinn: Exposing the Fake History that Turned a Generation Against America, scholar Mary Grabar notes in her chapter titled, \u201cColumbus Bad, Indians Good\u201d:\n\nThe truth is that Zinn\u2019s description of Columbus\u2019s first encounter with the American Indians is lifted from Columbus: His Enterprise: Exploding the Myth, a book for high school students that Zinn\u2019s friend and fellow anti-Vietnam War activist, Hans Koning, first published in 1976. In other words, though one of Zinn\u2019s radical America-hating colleagues did the initial work of smearing Columbus, Zinn got the credit.\n\nGrabar noted the political agenda advanced by both Zinn and Hans Koning did not go unnoticed by media of many leanings.\n\nIn its obituary for Koning in 2007, the New York Times, observed Grabar, said he had created an \u201c\u2019emotional firestorm\u2019 by portraying Columbus as \u2018a deep-eyed [sic] villain, raping, pillaging and enslaving as he ruthlessly pursued profits.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe continues that \u201cKoning\u2019s book was panned by commentators and historians who took notice of the change in tenor as the five hundredth anniversary of the discovery of America approached in 1992.\u201d\n\nAt the Independent, Harvey Morris wrote in anticipation of Columbus Day that year that Koning was a \u201chistorical reductionist,\u201d who \u201crefuse[s] to accept any nuances in the character or context of Columbus\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nAccording to Grabar, Morris said Koning engaged in \u201cthe clich\u00e9 of comparing him [Columbus] to Hitler and the Nazis.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, Zinn based his famous opening pages on a controversial book,\u201d Grabar writes. \u201cAnd while Koning\u2019s work was treated dismissively, Zinn\u2019s transcriptions of Koning\u2019s material to his own book are taken as groundbreaking historical revelations.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd few know that they are little more than transcriptions,\u201d she asserts.", "description": "The GOP mayor of Waterville, Maine, issued a proclamation declaring October 14 Columbus Day in his city, rather than Indigenous Peoples' Day.", "authors": ["Dr. Susan Berry"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/historic-painting-of-Christopher-Columbus-1492-AP-Photo-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
