These porters earned meagre pay, got little-to-no-sleep, and were constantly separated from their families, zig-zagging the country.\n\nSo why did they do it?\n\nStanley Grizzle worked as a train porter for 20 years. He said he did it because he needed to eat, and there wasn't other work available for black men at the time.\n\nThis history, and the story of how Grizzle went from being a porter to leading a movement and eventually receiving the Order of Canada, is chronicled in Cecil Foster's new book, They Call Me George: The Untold Story of Black Train Porters and the Birth of Modern Canada.\n\nA recipient of the Order of Canada, Stanley Grizzle died Nov. 18, 2016 at age 97.

So that's what he sought to learn.\n\nCirca 1875: Pullman Pioneer sleeping car, the first sleeper made by the firm.
