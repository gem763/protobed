(\u201cFun fact: his last name is Cosby and you can see why he dropped it,\u201d Oliver said.) As the Democratic primaries approach, 2020 presidential candidates have been proposing various bills they hope to pass once they are in office\u2014from Medicare for All to new housing to freedom dividends. \u201cThe problem is that as appealing as some of those ideas sound, none are likely to happen\u2026because they have to go through the Senate,\u201c Oliver said. \u201cYou know the Senate, the country\u2019s second-most influential body after Dwayne \u2018The Rock\u2018 Johnson\u2019s.\u201d\n\nCurrently, the Senate is \u201ca giant non-functioning roadblock,\u201d and that\u2019s not according to Oliver, but according to a montage of farewell clips from Senators leaving their posts. Oliver noted that the last big piece of legislation the Senate passed was arguably \u201cObamacare a decade ago\u201d and that\u2019s largely due to \u201cone incredibly annoying legislative tool.\u201d Oliver made sure to note that he was not referring to Sen. Mitch McConnell\u2014\u201calthough he is certainly at fault\u201d\u2014but to the filibuster, a delay tactic that ensures a bill is never voted on. According to Oliver, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington made the filibuster look like a good idea, the same way The Wizard of Oz made going on trip with \u201ca furry, a vagrant and an axe-wielding robot seem like a good idea.\u201d In practice, the filibuster means a simple majority is no longer enough to pass laws and \u201ctheoretically\u201c allows Senators from 21 states that represent \u201cjust 11% of Americans\u201d to overrule laws for everyone else. \u201cTo quote anyone who has ever sat in a bathroom stall with a three inch gap in the door, why on earth was it designed this way?\u201d Oliver asked, before launching into explanation of the tool.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

A bill can be killed by filibuster if a Senator merely announces they have 41 votes and a desire to filibuster, which means that its use has skyrocketed. According to Oliver, \u201cWe have reached the point where Senators don\u2019t so much brag about what they have passed as brag about what they will obstruct.\u201c\n\nDespite the risk of rolling back the filibuster rule, Oliver believes it is worth it. To prove that point, he proceeded to filibuster the filibuster with his own 15 hour speech\u2014sort of.\n\nWatch John Oliver on Last Week Tonight below.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "To argue against the filibuster, John Oliver launched into a 15-hour speech of his own\u2014sort of", "authors": ["Melissa Locker"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/john_oliver_last_week_tonight_era.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C10px%2C1024px%2C536px&resize=1200%2C628&strip", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
