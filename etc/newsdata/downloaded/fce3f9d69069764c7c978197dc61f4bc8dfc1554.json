(Retuers)\n\nJerry Rice: \u2018We got played\u2019\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers icon widely considered the game\u2019s greatest-ever receiver spoke with the Bay Area\u2019s 95.7 The Game Monday morning.\n\nHis take? \u201cWe all got played.\u201d\n\nIn conclusion, we all got played. pic.twitter.com/tHVGiZGWQQ \u2014 95.7 The Game (@957thegame) September 9, 2019\n\n\u201cHe contacted me,\u201d Rice said. \u201cHe told me he wanted to play ball here in the Bay Area. I bought into it because I can only take a man at his word, but I think this was already planned.\u201d\n\nBrown had sought mentoring from Rice\n\nStory continues\n\nBefore the Steelers traded Brown, but after it was clear that the two sides were splitting up, Rice offered to mentor Brown and said he spoke with him about coming to the Bay Area, specifically with the 49ers.\n\n\u201cHe wants to come here really bad,\u201d Rice told 95.7 in January. \u201c \u2026 He\u2019s talking about running the hill with me \u2014 doing all that and just working out and just picking my brain.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Brown did little to dispel Rice\u2019s message with an Instagram post that appeared to display his affection and respect for Rice.\n\nInstagram/AB\n\nRice: Brown put on a Denzel performance\n\nBut now Rice feels like he got duped, along with everyone else.\n\n\"I think when he asked to be released from the Steelers, he wanted to go to the Patriots,\" Rice told 95.7, per NBC Sports Bay Area. \"He wanted them to trade him to the Patriots. And there was no way that the Steelers would trade him to a rival. So he had to go a different route. And he decided to come through the Bay Area. And I feel sorry for the fans over in Oakland. \"He was a Denzel Washington and he won the Oscar. He won an Oscar, guys. I'm gonna be honest with you.\u201d\n\nWhatever the truth is, there\u2019s no denying that Brown and the Patriots won out in the saga. And the rest of the NFL lost.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Jerry Rice compared Antonio Brown to Denzel Washington for the saga that landed him in New England.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/E5Y7W6vIesO8Lc1DqFns5w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/EcxREWJPEeraNewhTG4bpw--~B/aD0zNDU2O3c9NTE4NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/f48370d0-d350-11e9-af73-c405d1748a53", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
