Wearing indoor shades, she grabbed the mic to lay down some bars over The Roots' drumbeat. She kicked off with a shoutout to The Carters, especially Beyonc\u00e9 who complimented her glowing skin tone in the best song from The Lion King: The Gift album, \"Brown Skin Girls.\" Troublemaker also seamlessly weaved a plug for her own book Sulwe, and she thanked host Jimmy Fallon because she's a classy emcee.

The best new rapper is here, and it's Troublemaker.\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nFollow Taylor Hosking on Twitter and Instagram .", "description": "Her alter ego \"Troublemaker\" came out to play on 'The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.'", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d9c9014e31505000ab5c77b/lede/1570543430701-Lupita-AM.png?crop=0.9884444444444445xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
