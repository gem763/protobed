Obviously being on Saturday night live TV for 14 years was a massive part of my life.\n\n\"To be on the other channel, on The X Factor, I never thought I'd be saying that. It was a privilege and an honour. I love it.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nBrendan also hit back at Strictly critics who blasted the controversial decision to send Catherine Tyldesley home.\n\nHe said: \"The thing with Strictly is it's an entertainment show.\n\n\"I always says if you've been kicked out you haven't entertained. Even though I've cried sometimes when I've been kicked out and didn't think it was right.\n\n\"If you've been kicked out and weren't entertaining enough to get the vote, there's not point of you being there anyway.\"\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nBrendan previously spoke about his shock Strictly departure earlier this year on ITV's Lorraine\n\nHe told Lorraine Kelly: \"This is quite hard to talk about. The BBC haven\u2019t renewed my contract \u2013 we get renewed year on year \u2013 and they made an editorial decision not to have me back on the show.\n\n\"I\u2019m a little bit in shock. I\u2019m quite emotional, a bit raw about it.\"\n\nThe professional dancer admitted it was not his decision to leave - and speculated it could be because he iss a 'strong character'.\n\nHe added: \u201cI\u2019ve always known this day would come. To get to this point, the BBC make the decisions year upon year. It\u2019s an editorial decision.\n\n\"I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll never know the ins and outs. I\u2019m a very strong character within the show, I have my strong views.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Mirror Pride of Britain Awards, in partnership with TSB, will broadcast on ITV on 5th November at 8pm.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: The former Strictly Come Dancing star is pushing X Factor bosses after being ditched after the auditions", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Daily Mirror", "Itv", "Bbc Guy Levy", "Pa", "Bbc"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20748400.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_AGP_MDM_POB_28102019_037JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
