This Gallery Sets the Pace", "language": "en", "text": "There\u2019s a new art leviathan in New York City.\n\nThe new Pace Gallery building, an eight-floor 75,000 square footer built from the ground up at 540 West 25th Street, which opened for art business this week\u2014and which has already acquired the monicker, Super Pace\u2014is very much the brainchild of Marc Glimcher, who took over as CEO of Pace from his father, Arne, in 2011.\n\nIt speaks to the ambitions of the enterprise that the fact that The Who performed at an opening party seemed in keeping rather than hoopla.\n\nArne Glimcher opened Pace in Boston in 1960, and moved it to New York in 1963. The gallery prospered. In 1980 he sold a Jasper Johns canvas, \u201cThree Flags,\u201d to the Whitney Museum for a million dollars, a first for a living artist. Pace was a mega-gallery before the term came into use, and in the birthing of this new space they are giving the finger to some received art world wisdom.\n\nIn June 2014 I was moderator at an Artnet roundtable discussion of the art world\u2019s ongoing state of melt. One factor discussed was the increasing wealth gap between a handful of mega-galleries and the small and mid-size galleries, who have always been an essential part of the system, being the ones who take on young artists, and develop their careers, until, pfffft!, hit artists, the earners, are snapped up by the megas.\n\nWhat Doug Walla of Kent Fine Art called \u201cThe Instagram Crisis\u201d was also discussed. \u201cPeople are not physically experiencing work any longer,\u201d he said. \u201cTraffic is way down in galleries.\u201d\n\nStefan Stux identified another problem, described as \u201cThe Trojan horse of the Chelsea art world, which is the High Line.\u201d\n\nThe latter\u2019s success has caused Chelsea rents to rocket, which, together with the costs of another phenomenon, art fairs, have hit small and mid-size galleries, causing many to close, even while things seem to be getting rosier and rosier for such megas as Hauser & Wirth, Gagosian and David Zwirner, who will be opening his own new Chelsea operation, 50,000 square foot of exhibition space, designed by Renzo Piano, on West 21st Street, in 2021.\n\nThis indeed was the first issue I touched on with Marc Glimcher.\n\n\u201c The demise of the mid and small galleries is way over-exaggerated, by the way. A lot of those galleries are doing great \u201d\n\n\u201cWe do not believe that the big galleries have the capacity to edge out all these small and medium-size galleries,\u201d Glimcher said. \u201cThey may have the economic power to do it. But they don\u2019t have the capacity to replace what those galleries are doing. So we know that something can happen. The market is very imperfect.\n\n\u201cSo our answer is that we\u2019re very collaborative, we are very dedicated to working with medium and small galleries. And when their artists require whatever special abilities we have, that doesn\u2019t mean that they need to leave their smaller galleries. We didn\u2019t invent these problems but they are definitely putting pressure on the system.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThe demise of the mid and small galleries is way over-exaggerated, by the way. A lot of those galleries are doing great.\u201d\n\nAs to the size of their operation, Glimcher relates it to the size of the world of which it is a part.\n\n\u201cMy father said there were 25 collectors when he started,\u201d he told me. \u201cHow many people now consider contemporary art an essential part of their life? I argue that it\u2019s tens of millions, if not hundreds. Listen, we are the medium of the future even though we are the most old-fashioned medium. Art is tailor-made for this exploding new world. We invented the Experience Economy.\u201d\n\nThat art experience will continue to power Chelsea, he feels.\n\n\u201cEvery place the art business went, it got replaced by retail,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had whatever impact we had on the neighborhood, it suddenly became a very cool place to be, so retail came in and priced us out. And we would have to move on.\n\n\u201cChelsea is the first place where that is not going to happen. That is because retail is in such distress and because experience is in such demand. And we have here a great experiential neighborhood. And it has fostered a great residential boom, which no-one expected would ever happen. And retail is helpless, their rents are falling and ours are climbing.\u201d\n\nSo to the depleted foot traffic in galleries, what Doug Walla called the Instagram Crisis\u2014and it may just be that Pace finds at least a partial solution in their most recent spin-off, PaceX.\n\n\u201c We said, \u2018Tickets? Are you insane? Artists don\u2019t sell tickets. That\u2019s a cardinal rule. Only museums sell tickets!\u2019 \u201d\n\nThis represents artists who don\u2019t make objects, but experiences, events which might perhaps be described as the grandchildren of the Happenings of the \u201860s, but usually with tech wizardry thrown in. One such group is Random International, a brilliant three-man collective I saw at Design Miami Basel in 2009, and another being Team Lab, a Tokyo group.\n\nNow, art experiences are great but how does one, erm, monetize them\u2014the rent at 540 West 25th being, I have been told, north of $750,000 a month? Do the art events leave collectible residue? \u201cSome,\u201d Marc Glincher said. \u201cSome do, some don\u2019t. Some do, because they have had to learn to survive.\u201d\n\nAs to survival, though, Glimcher added some details of his first meeting with Team Lab, when Pace began representing them about five years ago. \u201cThey said, \u2018We were going to do this big exhibition with multiple experiences in it, and you have to sell tickets,\u2019\u201d Glimcher recalled. \u201cAnd we said, \u2018Tickets? Are you insane? Artists don\u2019t sell tickets. That\u2019s a cardinal rule. Only museums sell tickets!\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd these guys are like, \u2018No, no, no! We sell tickets.\u2019\n\n\u201cWe said, \u2018This is outrageous! We don\u2019t even own a cash register.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe head of this art group said, \u2018So, what you\u2019re telling me is if it\u2019s not commodified, it\u2019s not art?\u2019\u201d\n\nGlimcher said he wasn\u2019t saying any such thing, but the Team Lab artist said he was. \u201cHe said, \u2018Essentially what you\u2019re saying is that for art to be great it must be protected by the ultra-rich.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201c The disruption in the art world is not going to come from the Internet, it\u2019s not going to come from business-people. It\u2019s coming from the artists \u201d\n\nGlimcher took up the group\u2019s challenge. Pace would sell tickets for $20 a time at their Palo Alto gallery. They sold 250,000 tickets. \u201cAnd then we sent it to Beijing where we sold half a million tickets. Now they opened in Tokyo and they sold two and a half million tickets last year, something like that.\u201d (TeamLab did not immediately return The Daily Beast\u2019s request for comment.)\n\nGlimcher reached back to the one of the glories of 19th century American art for a precedent: the Hudson River School. \u201cFrederick Church came up with the idea,\u201d he said. \u201cHe charged a nickel to see his painting of Niagara Falls. So we were open to that evolution.\u201d\n\nHence, Space X. \u201cThe disruption in the art world is not going to come from the Internet, it\u2019s not going to come from business-people,\u201d Glimcher said. \u201cIt\u2019s coming from the artists. The artists are going to change the model of how they engage with the public. Changes are coming.\u201d\n\nAnd then he repeated that last sentence again.", "description": "The new, eight-floor Pace Gallery building opened this week, acquiring the moniker \u201cSuper Pace.\u201d Its CEO reveals how it will thrive, despite the perils facing New York\u2019s art world.", "authors": ["Anthony Haden-Guest"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569106584/190922-haden-guest-pace-gallery-hero_o6lfzz", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
