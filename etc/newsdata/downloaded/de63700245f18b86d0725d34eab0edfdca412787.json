It\u2019s arguably even better than using the official games to battle, since it\u2019s faster and more customisable. Showdown is so good that professional players even use it to practice for Nintendo\u2019s official tournaments.\n\nMuch of Showdown\u2019s appeal is a matter of convenience. When trying to find a battle on Battle Spot, Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s official in-game battling service, the first thing you notice is the lengthy wait before you find an opponent, which can last five to 10 minutes. Not so in Showdown: Thanks to the sheer quantity of players, the wait for an in-browser battle is rarely more than five or 10 seconds.\n\nPok\u00e9mon battles have always been an important part of the games, but it took a few years before they were first simulated online. Pok\u00e9mon Crystal, released in Japan in 2000, was the first game to let players battle remote users with their cell phones. But that feature didn\u2019t make it to the overseas releases of the game.\n\nIn 2001, a group of fans from a Pok\u00e9mon message board called Azure Heights created Porygon\u2019s Big Show, which was at the time the only way to battle Pok\u00e9mon remotely.\n\nPorygon\u2019s Big Show offered players text-only battles with opponents from across the world, without the need for a 4,000-kilometre-long cable running between their Game Boys. It paved the way for other such simulators including Pok\u00e9mon Online, which many considered to be the best simulator to date upon its release in 2010. It fixed a lot of known issues from previous simulators and offered the most accurate text-based battles in your browser.\n\nShowdown\u2019s creator, Guangcong \u201cZarel\u201d Luo, played a lot of Pokemon Online, but eventually got bored of its basic interface.\n\n\u201cI was having a lot of fun with Pok\u00e9mon Online, but its replays were just text files,\u201d he told Kotaku. \u201cI got the idea of making a program that animated them, and it got popular enough that I decided to make my own simulator.\u201d\n\nLuo\u2019s work, which he first released in October 2011, fixed a lot of the bugs that other simulators had. But what Showdown players were most excited about was the custom 2D sprites and battle animations, a first for an unofficial battle simulator, and the biggest way that Showdown set itself apart from its competitors. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten way bigger than I\u2019ve ever thought it would,\u201d Luo said.\n\nShowdown gets around a million unique users per month, even more when new Pok\u00e9mon are added to the database alongside their release in a new official game. But it\u2019s not just the cute animations that attract Pok\u00e9mon fans to the browser game.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun and easy to use,\u201d Luo said, \u201cand it\u2019s a web game that doesn\u2019t require installing anything.\u201d If anything, Luo is underselling it. For starters, Pok\u00e9mon Showdown offers players countless more ways to play than official Pok\u00e9mon games do. You can follow Battle Spot rules to simulate what battles would be like on your 3DS, or use the rules from the Pok\u00e9mon Video Game Championships to practice for official tournaments.\n\nBut the options don\u2019t stop there.You can use randomly-generated teams, develop a team of Pok\u00e9mon that share a single type to battle other teams following the same team building rules, or painstakingly craft the perfect party to climb the ladder in the fan-made tier system known as the Smogon tiers.\n\nBarring organising the battle with a friend and agreeing to a set of rules beforehand, there is no way of limiting the Pok\u00e9mon brought to a battle on your 3DS or Switch. As such, most battles see teams of high-powered legendary Pok\u00e9mon face off against each other, which many players find repetitive and boring.\n\nSmogon is a community of Pok\u00e9mon fans most famous for its tier system, which sorts all 807 Pok\u00e9mon into one of six different tiers based on how often they are used. The most powerful Pok\u00e9mon reside in the Ubers tier, and they go down the rankings into OverUsed (OU), UnderUsed (UU), RarelyUsed (RU), NeverUsed (NU), and finally PU, as in pee-yew, the tier reserved for only the silliest, most useless monsters.\n\nSmogon tiers offer a chance for less-useful Pok\u00e9mon to shine. OU, or Over Used, is the most popular tier, as it eliminates most legendaries and \u201cbroken\u201d mega-evolutions, but allows the full scope of the rest of the Pok\u00e9dex, including most of the Ultra Beasts, a classification of legendary Pok\u00e9mon introduced in Sun and Moon.\n\nJoey \u201cPok\u00e9aim\u201d Sciarrone, a YouTuber who specialises in Pok\u00e9mon content, told Kotaku that separating the creatures into tiers like this lets every Pok\u00e9mon shine.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s take a Pok\u00e9mon like Guzzlord, for instance,\u201d he said, \u201cprobably the weakest of the Ultra Beasts. In PU [tier], Guzzlord is S- rank. It\u2019s one of the better Pok\u00e9mon in the tier because it can drop strong, heavy hits like Draco Meteor.\u201d Since Kotaku spoke to Sciarrone, Guzzlord was promoted to one of the Smogon system\u2019s \u201cborderline\u201d ranks, where its usage and success will determine if it gets to move up the ranks to NU.\n\nIn this way, you could field a team of awful Pok\u00e9mon like Vanilish and Metapod, but still have a fair(ish) fight in a low tier. Other specialty tiers include Little Cup for baby Pok\u00e9mon and Doubles for 2v2 battles.\n\nSciarrone has nearly 200,000 YouTube subscribers, and about 80 per cent of his uploads follow his competitive battles on Pok\u00e9mon Showdown. He agrees with its creator Luo that, while the Smogon tiers are a great addition, it\u2019s ultimately the accessibility that appeals to people.\n\n\u201cOne of the main reasons I use Showdown is the accessibility and the quickness to finding games,\u201d Sciarrone said. If you only played the official games, you might have to wait for a few minutes for a battle with someone who just might not be taking it as seriously as you.\n\nFor top-rated players like Sciarrone, who battles daily as part of his career, it can also be difficult to find other players who are at the same competitive level simply using the random matchmaking of Battle Spot. Showdown\u2019s ladder system keeps people of similar skill levels fighting each other, resulting in tight, fun battles every time you open your browser.\n\nFor YouTubers and Twitch streamers, too, it\u2019s a lot easier to simply record your computer\u2019s screen than it is to modify your 3DS to share your battles. Plus, Showdown battles offer the chance to skip animations and wait times, meaning that they are much faster-paced than Battle Spot\u2019s.\n\nShowdown is so useful that it\u2019s even used to practice for official tournaments. Wolfe Glick is the 2019 North American VGC Champion, a title which saw him become the first Pok\u00e9mon player to have won every level of official competition. He uses Showdown to build teams, test sets, and win Championships.\n\n\u201cI do use Showdown to prepare for tournaments,\u201d he told Kotaku. \u201cI generally do some laddering and then use it to test versus other players I trust.\u201d This testing involves using Showdown\u2019s team builder to try out different movesets and stat distributions.\n\nBuilding a specific team in Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon can take hours. First, you need a Ditto with six flawless Individual Values (IVs), which would be near-impossible to find without the use of handy Reddit traders, so most make do with five perfect IVs. Then, breed it with one of the Pok\u00e9mon you want to use in your team. Make sure Ditto\u2019s holding the rare Destiny Knot item to ensure it passes down its IVs, and then wait. Hatch the resulting egg, if it\u2019s not right, do it again. And again. And again.\n\nAll manner of things need to be perfect, from the six flawless IV statistics to the Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s nature and ability, so it can take a while to even breed the right monster. Then, you need to train it to level 50, teach it the right moves, and train all of its 508 Effort Value (EV) stats. Now, onto the other five Pok\u00e9mon\u2026\n\nSometimes, this sort of grind can be a very therapeutic way to spend your days. Other times, like when you realise your Garchomp needs to be faster than a Kartana to get off a surprise Fire Fang and a Choice Scarf won\u2019t do, you need to breed a new Garchomp with a Jolly nature to replace your fully-trained Adamant buddy.\n\nOn Showdown, all this fine-tuning takes place in a matter of clicks. The ability to test minor stat changes before breeding your chosen Pok\u00e9mon in-game makes it the perfect way for professionals to test their teams ahead of official tournaments. Only after they verify how a certain team composition would work in Showdown\u2019s simulator do they go through the work of building that team in the official game.\n\nFor whatever reason, Nintendo hasn\u2019t issued any cease-and-desist orders to online Pok\u00e9mon battle simulators, in the way it usually does to other fan games. While a battle simulator is considerably different from a ROM hack, Showdown still uses trademarked names and copyrighted artwork, which could be an issue if Nintendo ever decides to come knocking. Luo declined to comment on any potential legal issues.\n\nShowdown offers players the most competitive, varied, and fun Pok\u00e9mon battles, and it does so in a way that is complementary to Nintendo\u2019s official games. Whatever your skill level, whatever your favourite Pok\u00e9mon, whatever device or browser you\u2019re using, there is always a battle ready and waiting on Showdown. And whatever backlash the upcoming Switch games Sword and Shield receive, Pok\u00e9mon Showdown will be there with its old-school sprites, unique game modes, and full list of Pok\u00e9mon, as well as expanding to cover the gameplay of the next generation of the games and everything that Generation 8 brings.\n\n\u201cNew games always bring new game mechanics and renewed excitement for battling,\u201d Luo said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to it, as always!\u201d\n\nBen Sledge is a freelance games journalist, part-time Ganon slayer, and full-time Bulbasaur stan.", "description": "Around one million players a month are throwing down in Pok\u00e9mon Showdown, a fan-made, browser-based game that recreates the battles found in official Pok\u00e9mon games, with accurate stats.
