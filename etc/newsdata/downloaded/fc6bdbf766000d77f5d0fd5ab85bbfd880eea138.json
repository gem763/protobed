REUTERS/Ricardo Moraes\n\nBUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina central bank president Guido Sandleris pledged on Monday to do everything possible to protect the bank\u2019s international reserves, as the South American country transitions to a new leftist government amid swirling economic crisis.\n\nSandleris said during a press conference that the central bank will hold meetings with the team of President-elect Alberto Fernandez, who defeated incumbent Mauricio Macri in Sunday\u2019s presidential election, in order to help with a smooth transition.\n\nIn the early hours of Monday, the central bank announced it would tighten a restriction on dollar purchasing to $200 per month for individuals, down from $10,000 a month, until December, when the new government will be in place.\n\nThe move is meant to reduce dollar demand and stabilize the peso\u2019s exchange rate, Sandleris said.\n\n\u201cI know this measure, even though temporary, is very strict and affects many people. Its purpose is to preserve reserves during this transition period, until the new government defines its economic policies and the uncertainty dissipates,\u201d Sandleris said.\n\nThe central bank has spent about $22 billion in reserves to defend the peso since the Aug. 11 primary election after it lost about a quarter of its value that month, Sandleris said.\n\nThe bank first imposed currency controls at the beginning of September to stem the slide on the peso, sparked by a shock landslide defeat suffered by conservative leader Macri against Fernandez in the Aug. 11 primary election.\n\nThe new measures announced Monday were expected to help keep the peso stable when Argentina\u2019s local market opens, but would likely set off more volatility in the black market peso exchange rate of informally traded dollars, economists said.", "description": "Argentina central bank president Guido Sandleris pledged on Monday to do everything possible to protect the bank's international reserves, as the South American country transitions to a new leftist government amid swirling economic crisis.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445841771&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R0YW", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
