Where different jurisdictions jut up against one another, there is a border. In Northern Ireland, this is a problem unlike anywhere else in western Europe, given that a sizable minority of its population\u2014Irish nationalists\u2014aspire to remove the border that already exists.\n\nJonathan Powell, British Prime Minister Tony Blair\u2019s chief of staff during the Good Friday Agreement, said the difference between then and now is that the conundrum today, shaped by the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, is zero-sum. In 1998, all sides were able to claim victory because each extracted compromises from the others; in the case of Brexit, supporters of Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the EU specifically want their country to be able to set its own regulations and customs policy, which necessitates a border\u2014somewhere where these differing rules are enforced. And that border, Powell told me, will almost by definition break the delicate harmony created by the Good Friday Agreement.\n\n\u201cYou are going to upset this identity balance one way or the other,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are either going to make it worse for the unionists, because you are going to put in a border between the rest of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland, or you are going to put in a border between north and south. You are absolutely messing up the issue of identity.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s predecessor, Theresa May, had sought to address this tension by agreeing to a \u201cbackstop\u201d with the EU as part of her negotiated withdrawal deal. The idea is to keep Northern Ireland bound by EU law on certain key areas relating to the movement of physical goods, agriculture, and livestock across the Irish border and, to minimize the differences between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain, by keeping the whole of the U.K. in a Europe-wide customs zone.\n\nThe backstop, in this view, is simply a mechanism to protect the status quo until something else can be agreed on\u2014an insurance policy until Britain negotiates a new relationship with Europe. Yet while Varadkar has said the backstop can be replaced in the future, he insists that the mechanism has no time limit, and that it only be supplanted by something that achieves the exact same thing: Northern Ireland\u2019s legal alignment on all matters relating to the border. In other words, EU law, at least in part, must apply in Northern Ireland permanently as the price of Brexit. Johnson has said this is unacceptable and antidemocratic, while unionist parties in Northern Ireland have steadfastly refused to countenance the backstop, pointing out that Varadkar\u2019s position is tantamount to saying only another backstop can replace the backstop.\n\nNow, with weeks to go before Britain is due to exit the EU, and despite the political crisis in Westminster, senior officials and politicians believe at least a ray of light is visible. While Dublin\u2019s position\u2014that on industrial goods, farming, and agriculture, Northern Ireland should not have different rules from the Republic, and both should remain under the EU\u2019s jurisdiction\u2014remains unacceptable to unionists in Northern Ireland, there is at least some crossover in their positions. Ministers in London have suggested solutions built around an \u201call-Ireland\u201d economy and Nigel Dodds, a leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, the main political force representing unionists in Northern Ireland, told the BBC last night that his party\u2014historically opposed to such concessions\u2014is open to a variety of similar measures. Can the political will be found to close this narrowed gap?", "description": "The compromises made to reach the Good Friday Agreement offer hope Britain will solve its Brexit riddle.
