REUTERS/Nir Elias\n\nJERUSALEM (Reuters) - Jews, Muslims and Christians pass daily through the gates of Jerusalem\u2019s Old City, on their way to and from prayers or simply to go about their everyday business in one of the most politically sensitive spots on earth.\n\nThere are eight gates - seven are open and one is sealed - along the Old City walls that were built in the 16th century by Turkish sultan Suleiman the Magnificent.\n\nIt\u2019s always busy at Damascus Gate, the main entrance to the Muslim quarter, and at Jaffa Gate, facing west towards the Mediterranean, where local residents and tourists mix in markets lining stone alleyways.\n\nLion\u2019s Gate - two pairs of heraldic lions are carved on the archway - is also known as St. Stephen\u2019s Gate. It faces east, towards ancient Jericho. It is often crowded with Muslim worshippers after prayers at al-Aqsa mosque, Islam\u2019s third holiest shrine.\n\nMany Jewish worshippers take another route to Judaism\u2019s nearby Western Wall. They pass through the Dung Gate, the closest entrance to the holy place, and Jewish families on their way to celebrate a 13-year-old son\u2019s Bar Mitzvah can be spotted making their way to the wall.\n\nSecurity is always tight in a volatile area at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israeli police patrol and closed circuit TV cameras monitor the passageways of the Old City.\n\nIsrael views all of Jerusalem, including the walled Old City that it captured in the 1967 Middle East war, as its \u201ceternal and indivisible\u201d capital.\n\nPalestinians want East Jerusalem, where the Old City is located, as the capital of a state they seek to establish in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.", "description": "Jews, Muslims and Christians pass daily through the gates of Jerusalem's Old City, on their way to and from prayers or simply to go about their everyday business in one of the most politically sensitive spots on earth.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1438143731&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF961C0", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
