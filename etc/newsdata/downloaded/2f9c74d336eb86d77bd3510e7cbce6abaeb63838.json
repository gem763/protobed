Nicholas was 27 at the time, according to documents.\n\nA man jogging that morning noticed a girl lying motionless on the ground and a man kneeling over her, according to court documents. But the jogger thought, \"they were a couple 'making out' and jogged on,\" according to documents.\n\nJust after 9 a.m., two 12-year-old boys saw a man emerge from the bushy hillside near the school; after the man walked away, the boys looked by the hillside and saw the teen's body, dressed in a drill team uniform, documents said.\n\nWhile semen was discovered on the teen's clothes at the crime scene, and the DNA profile was searched regularly in state and national DNA databases, no match was made for decades, according to documents.\n\nTed S. Warren/AP\n\nLast week, genealogists working on the case zeroed in on two brothers identified through the novel investigative technique known as genetic genealogy, which uses an unknown suspect's DNA to trace his or her family tree.\n\nOne of the brothers identified by the genealogists was ruled out, because he had a prior rape conviction and his DNA was in CODIS -- and the DNA wasn't a match, according to court documents.\n\nThe second brother was Patrick Nicholas. He had served time in prison for an attempted rape from 1983, but his DNA was never entered into CODIS, according to the court documents.\n\nCourtesy Kings County Sheriffs Office\n\nPatrick Nicholas had also been arrested in 1993 for child molestation for which he pleaded guilty to a fourth-degree charge of gross misdemeanor assault, according to court documents.\n\nThis weekend investigators surveilled 55-year-old Nicholas and collected a cigarette that he'd tossed on the ground, court documents said.\n\nThe cigarette was sent for testing, and investigators learned Wednesday that the DNA from the cigarette matched the DNA on Yarborough's clothes, documents said.\n\nNicholas was taken into custody Wednesday night for first-degree murder, authorities said.\n\nAlmost 4,000 tips had been submitted in the Yarborough case by the time of the arrest -- but none of the tips identified Nicholas, King County Sheriff's Detective Kathleen Decker said at a Thursday news conference.\n\n\u201c \u201d If you're going to do something heinous, don't do it here. Because they'll come to get you.\n\nThere's no apparent connection between Nicholas and Yarborough, Decker said.\n\nThe prosecution says Nicholas will have an arraignment hearing on Oct. 17. No defense attorney is assigned to him yet.\n\nSarah Yarborough's mother, Laura Yarborough, spoke at a news conference on Thursday where the arrest was announced, and she called her slain daughter an excellent student, who always had a book in her hand. The teen was excited for college, with big hopes and dreams for her future, her mother said.\n\nKOMO\n\nThe sheriff said, \"few things in law enforcement are more rewarding than telling a parent that you believe you have solved the murder of their child.\"\n\nLaura Yarborough said even when she gave up at times, the detectives never did.\n\n\"If you're going to do something heinous, don't do it here. Because they'll come to get you,\" Laura Yarborough said.", "description": "Sarah Yarborough, 16, was found dead in bushes outside a school in December 1991.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/yarborough-flt-ht-ps-191004_hpMain_3_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
