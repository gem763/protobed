Not only would I benefit from the broad-reaching gentle shade and added greenery in my yard, but she declared that it was dedicated to her mother. When she planted it, she placed photos of her mom at the roots before adding the soil. When her young son remarked that the leaves of his grandmother\u2019s tree looked like hearts, which they do, the sentiment couldn\u2019t have been more touching or perfect.\n\nThe tree, says Mary, was about creating something physical and tangible to honour her mother. The beauty and permanence of that gesture has stuck with me, season after season when the gentle pink blossoms give way to the heart-shaped foliage.\n\nYou'll Also Love: 9 Books to Help Kids Understand Death\n\nHow we remember lost loved ones is an important part of life. So often, as adults, our memories of our parents are marred by the painful details of their passing, whether sudden or slow. And in dealing with the grief and loss it\u2019s easy to forget that our children have lost someone important to them as well.\n\nI kept her home from school (a win in her books!) and she made a list of all the things she and Grandma used to do together.\n\nSo when, in the last year, my 10-year-old daughter lost both of her grandmothers in the course of six months, I found myself wondering how to keep her memories of them alive in a way that\u2019s meaningful enough to last well into her adult life.\n\nIn contemplating ways to create traditions, I did what I always do: talked to friends and family about their experiences. And as usual, a few common themes emerged. But most poignant, to me at least, is that with a little foresight, parents are able to keep the memories alive when the inevitable happens \u2014 particularly if kids are still relatively small with memories that are bound to fade.\n\nSpend A Day Doing Their Favourite Things\n\nWhile many cultures have a day where people collectively honour the spirits of their ancestors, like the Day of the Dead in Mexico, Canada doesn\u2019t have a similar tradition. Instead, spending a day doing what a grandparent loved is a great way to create a lingering connection, and, in my opinion, more personal.\n\nFor instance, when we got the news from B.C. that my husband\u2019s mother passed, my daughter and I declared it a \u201cDay of Grandma.\" I kept her home from school (a win in her books!) and she made a list of all the things she and grandma used to do together. We went to her favourite lunch spot in our \u2018hood, we went to a library because grandma loved books, and, shrewdly, my girl opted to go to the mall instead of the ROM because, honestly, grandma loved shopping. We honoured her with a treat from Purdy\u2019s and a purchase from American Girl \u2014 two favourite stores to take her granddaughter despite my initial protests! It was a wonderful, meaningful day that will repeat each year.\n\nAnd I already know that for her grandfathers we\u2019ll have days full of long ravine walks followed by scones, or woodworking projects followed by fondue. But let\u2019s hope those days are in the distant future!\n\nEnjoy Their Favourite Foods\n\nSpeaking of scones and fondue, food is a perfect way to create a multi-generational connection. It\u2019s something you can make together and share. Plus, it\u2019s delicious.\n\nFor me, food was one of the best parts of visiting my grandparents. We were bestowed with plate after plate of handmade Italian delights: fresh cappelletti soup, homemade pizzelle (tie plates in the local tongue) and, my absolute favourite, handmade cacciatore that sat in giant bottles of oil in my papa\u2019s workshop.\n\nI only wish I\u2019d learned more of her recipes when I had the chance, though it doesn\u2019t stop my brother and me from trying.\n\nTo this day, there has never been a gnocchi or cacciatore as good as those of my grandparents, and when I find something close I\u2019m transported instantly to their little bungalow in Sault Ste. Marie. I only wish I\u2019d learned more of her recipes when I had the chance, though it doesn\u2019t stop my brother and me from trying.\n\nMary, my neighbour, says that even more meaningful than her tree for her kids is the tradition of making ravioli. It was her mother\u2019s speciality and once a year the family makes pasta together and shares family stories. For one of her sons, it\u2019s his other grandmother\u2019s tapioca pudding that holds the dearest spot in his heart (and stomach). Whenever he visits his family in Windsor, he\u2019s greeted with a big bowl of it that\u2019s all his own.\n\nMary already knows that it will be a part of his son\u2019s enduring memories of his grandmother after she\u2019s gone \u2014 and she knows she\u2019d better learn the recipe while she can.\n\nMake a Memory Book\n\nPutting together a photo album or a scrapbook is surely an obvious expression, but you\u2019d be surprised how easy it is to come up short. When my mom passed last year we were left with the realization that, aside from a trove of old black-and-white photos, we had very few recent photos of her, a fact made more poignant when my niece asked my brother why she didn\u2019t have any photos of just her and nonna.\n\nHer time with her grandkids was spent cooking, crafting or hanging out by the lake. For my daughter, making handmade cards for all occasions with nonna\u2019s well-stocked card kit is one way she\u2019s able to share her memories of her time alone with my mom. But I wish I\u2019d been more insistent on taking photos of nonna with the grands (or retaking them when they didn\u2019t turn out so great).\n\nBy contrast, when my sister-in-law\u2019s dad passed this fall, she had the most wonderful artifacts to share at his celebration of life \u2014 largely because he had envisioned that moment. For several years, he had been working on his legacy scrapbook, which included newspaper clippings of his university antics, patents he filed, songs he\u2019d composed and even a letter from Winston Churchill! He was a fascinating bloke and he wanted the grandkids \u2014 and their kids \u2014 to remember what he was like. The family even filmed the process. The whole thing \u201ccouldn\u2019t have been more Brian\u201d as everyone kept remarking, and is a wonderful legacy for his descendants.\n\nJust as he\u2019d wanted \u2014 and planned for.", "description": "From cooking favourite foods to spending a day doing their favourite things, here are a few ways to celebrate and honour a loved one's life.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/parents/content/imgs/_8col/BOY-HUGS-GRANDMOTHER.jpg", "published_at": "2017-11-02"}
