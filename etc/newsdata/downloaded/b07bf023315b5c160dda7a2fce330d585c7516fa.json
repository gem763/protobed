The deal includes about 60 million square feet of warehouse space across 465 light industrial buildings in 26 U.S. markets, as well as an affiliated operating platform, according to a statement Monday.\n\nThe unit\u2019s properties mostly serve as the last mile of the logistics chain and are crucial for companies seeking to make speedy deliveries to consumers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been the big buyer of warehouses around the world, probably bought $70 billion, on the simple premise that goods are moving from physical retail to online retail,\u201d Blackstone President Jonathan Gray said in a Sept. 25 interview at the Bloomberg Global Business Forum.\n\nThe agreement follows Blackstone\u2019s acquisition of $18.7 billion of warehouses from Singapore\u2019s GLP Pte. earlier this year. The firm has added more than 360 million square feet of U.S. industrial space over the last two years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Lindsay Dutch, building a portfolio to rival warehouse giant Prologis Inc.\n\n\u201cBlackstone may eventually take its U.S. warehouse portfolio public, as it did with Invitation Homes, the largest single-family REIT, in 2017 and Brixmor, the second-largest owner of open-air strip centers, in 2013,\u201d Dutch wrote in a note.\n\nU.S. industrial rents increased faster than expected in the first half of 2020, according to an August report from Green Street Advisors. Slowing trade and manufacturing growth could slow rent hikes in 2020, but investor demand remains \u201cfervent across all transaction sizes,\u201d the report said.\n\nColony Capital, which acquired industrial buildings as recently as March, is shedding traditional commercial real estate and investing in data centers and cell towers. The company wants such digital assets to account for 90% of its investments, executives said at an industry conference this month.\n\nThe deal is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter, according to the statement. The Wall Street Journal reported the acquisition earlier Monday.\n\n(Updates with chart, analyst\u2019s quote in sixth paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Patrick Clark in New York at pclark55@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Rob Urban at robprag@bloomberg.net, Steve Dickson\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Blackstone Group Inc., which has acquired more than 1 billion square feet of logistics space since 2010 as part of the firm\u2019s global focus on e-commerce, is extending its bet on last-mile real estate.The private equity giant agreed to buy Colony Industrial, the warehouse unit of Colony", "authors": ["Patrick Clark"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DqdrTK.2eYqqooT_LqUwRQ--~B/aD03ODQ7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/87b9234fffb95e84866a3e0ef17924e2", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
