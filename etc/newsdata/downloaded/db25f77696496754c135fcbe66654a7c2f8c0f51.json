Police noted the officer cursed and struck the motorist dozens of times in the leg.\n\nThe Kent County prosecutor's office earlier declined to bring criminal charges against the officer. Brown faces an Oct. 28 trial on a charge of resisting police.\n\nThe Grand Rapids Police Department has faced recent scrutiny, including an investigation by Michigan's Civil Rights office into complaints of discrimination.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nInformation from: The Grand Rapids Press, http://www.mlive.com/grand-rapids", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
