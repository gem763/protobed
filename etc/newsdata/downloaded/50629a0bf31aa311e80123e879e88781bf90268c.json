The second official is among those interviewed by the intelligence community inspector general to corroborate the allegations of the original whistleblower, one of the people said.\n\nThe inspector general, Michael Atkinson, briefed lawmakers privately Friday about how he substantiated the whistleblower\u2019s account. It was not clear whether he told lawmakers that the second official is considering filing a complaint.\n\nA new complaint, particularly from someone closer to the events, would potentially add further credibility to the account of the first whistleblower, a CIA officer who was detailed to the National Security Council at one point. He said that he relied on information from more than half a dozen American officials to compile his allegations about Trump\u2019s campaign to solicit foreign election interference that could benefit him politically.\n\nOther evidence has emerged to back the whistleblower\u2019s claim. A reconstructed transcript of a July call between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy released by the White House also showed Trump pressuring Ukraine. Trump appeared to believe that its release would quell the push for impeachment, but it only emboldened House Democrats.\n\nBecause the second official has met with Atkinson\u2019s office, it was unclear whether he needs to file a complaint to gain the legal protections offered to intelligence community whistleblowers. Witnesses who speak with inspectors general are protected by federal law that outlaws reprisals against officials who cooperate with an inspector general.\n\nWhistleblowers have created a new threat for Trump. Though the White House has stonewalled Democrats in Congress investigating allegations raised in the special counsel\u2019s report, the president has little similar ability to stymie whistleblowers from speaking to Congress.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks to reporters as he departs the White House in Washington, Friday, Oct. 4, 2019. (Anna Moneymaker/The New York Times) More\n\nThe Trump administration had blocked Atkinson from sharing the whistleblower complaint with lawmakers but later relented.\n\nTrump and his allies have taken aim at the credibility of the original whistleblower by noting that he had secondhand knowledge. The president has also singled out his sources, saying that they were \u201cclose to a spy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to know who\u2019s the person who gave the whistleblower the information because that\u2019s close to a spy,\u201d Trump told staffers at the U.S. mission to the United Nations. \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart with spies and treason, right? We used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d\n\nAtkinson has identified some indications of \u201carguable political bias\u201d that the whistleblower had in favor of a rival candidate. But the inspector general said that the existence of that bias did not alter his conclusion that the complaint was credible.\n\nStill, testimony from someone with more direct knowledge of Trump\u2019s efforts to use U.S. foreign policy for potential political gain would most likely undermine conservatives\u2019 attacks on the CIA officer\u2019s credibility.", "description": "WASHINGTON -- A second intelligence official who was alarmed by President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine is weighing whether to file his own formal whistleblower complaint and testify to Congress, according to two people briefed on the matter.The official has more direct information about the", "authors": ["Michael S.
