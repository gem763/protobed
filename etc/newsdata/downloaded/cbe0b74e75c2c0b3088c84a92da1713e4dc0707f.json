As the adults sip aperitivi and eat cheese upstairs, the kids lose themselves in the archive of Halloween costumes that date back to the \u201870s\n\nHalloween costumes, in particular, were made with care and attention back when she was a kid.\n\nMy wife is one of five siblings for whom homemade clothes and costumes were the norm. Halloween costumes, in particular, were made with care and attention back when she was a kid. They were made with bits of used clothing and textured samples from the bottom of the discount bin at the fabric store.\n\nThey were made to withstand the rough-and-tumble behaviour of children playing outside, with double stitching and extra padding in the knees and elbows. They were also made warm enough to keep their occupants comfy on a cold October evening.\n\nRead an Indigenous father's perspective on what it's like when you appropriate his culture for Halloween: My Culture Is Not Your or Your Kids' Halloween Costume\n\nAfter eight years of exploring that closet, the kids still come up from the basement dressed in something I\u2019ve never seen before. Bumblebees, dinosaurs, lions and princesses have all made appearances in the dining room, culled from an epic collection that started 40 years ago.\n\nEvery now and then, though, a costume will appear that has not aged well. Last year our eldest daughter, Sonia, appeared at the dining room table in a faux-Native costume: a beaded leather vest with feathers plus a leather headband that read, \u201cWhite Cloud.\u201d\n\nOur usual coos of approval were replaced with raised eyebrows and muted smiles. She was baffled at our reaction.\n\n\u201cThat costume is a little different than the rest,\u201d I said.\n\nWe didn\u2019t want to spoil her fun but also didn\u2019t want her to unwittingly participate in a system that treats objects from Indigenous cultures as the spoils of plunder.\n\n\u201cWhy? I like it,\u201d said Sonia.\n\n\u201cI know, but it\u2019s not really fair. Indigenous people are real people, not costumes.\u201d\n\nWe didn\u2019t want to spoil her fun but also didn\u2019t want her to unwittingly participate in a system that treats objects from Indigenous cultures as the spoils of plunder. When meaningful symbols and signs are remixed into Halloween bling, it is at the expense of a people whose culture has been systematically dismantled over time.\n\nThe \u201ccostume\u201d was a pastiche of pop culture versions of \u201cIndians\u201d from the \u201860s; a simulacrum far removed from the experiences of an actual Indigenous person, the kind who were driven off their land and penned up in reservations across the continent.\n\nEven though we often dress up like other people on Halloween, they should either be fictitious people like Harry Potter or Wonder Woman, or real people who have not experienced a several-hundred-year history of violence and displacement. Dressing up like a firefighter, sailor or a farmer is different because those people are not joining the conversation from a position of weakened power.\n\nWell, I might have said it a bit differently to my daughter.\n\nA mother's approach to discussing Indigenous history with your kids: Sharing the Message of Truth and Reconciliation With Your Kids\n\nWe let Sonia run around a little while longer with her cousins and then suggested some other costumes she could wear. Everybody loves dinosaurs! Ladybugs never experienced a cultural genocide! There are safer choices.\n\nShe shrugged when I told her it wasn\u2019t appropriate to wear and reluctantly took it off. I reminded her of the work they\u2019ve been doing at school by using First Nations values to structure each month of their school year. Indigenous artists and teachers have been visiting the school to help recast their culture as contemporary and dynamic, and not something confined to history textbooks (or Halloween costumes).\n\nThere is a real paradox here that requires reflection. It\u2019s important for our kids to know that the costume was made with love and care by a compassionate member of the family. When I was a kid, I too ran around and played \u201cCowboys and Indians\u201d with my friends, including one who was Anishnaabe, although at the time we didn\u2019t make the connection. I don\u2019t think he did either.\n\nThis year we\u2019re in less murky ethical territory. Our three kids have decided to go dressed as a witch, Pippy Longstocking and a Minion.\n\nBut actions born of love, or innocence are not mutually exclusive with actions born of ignorance that can end up hurting someone. It is imperative that we sit with this paradox. To know that intent doesn\u2019t override impact. Things can be two things. A costume can be a tool for play and imagination and at the same time can be a source of pain and frustration.\n\nThis year we\u2019re in less murky ethical territory. Our three kids have decided to go dressed as a witch, Pippy Longstocking and a Minion. And the school\u2019s policies have helped clarify costume policy for the kids in a manner way deeper than what we got when we were kids. Those lessons are sinking into how our kids think about Canada.\n\nThe other day our whole family was walking through Winchester Park just off Sherbourne Street in Toronto when we stumbled upon a beautiful mosaic, horizontal on the ground, over twelve feet in diameter and painstakingly made with pebbles. There was a turtle depicted in the centre. (Milestone by Red Dress Productions.)\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you know what that is dad?\u201d asked Sonia pointing at the turtle.\n\nThis dad feels Canadians are responsible for teaching kids about the MMIWG report. Read his thoughts here.\n\n\u201cUh, it\u2019s a sea turtle.\u201d I ventured.\n\n\u201cNo, the turtle is the animal that represents the country for the First Nations; he holds us all up on his back. We live on Turtle Island. See how it\u2019s round? That\u2019s what this is.\u201d She schooled me.\n\nShe continued to point out that fact that the Turtle was \u201cswimming\u201d in between a row of pebble-made high-rises on its left and a row of old-growth trees on its right, trying to navigate through two worlds. Sonia identified the cardinal directions by extending lines worked into the mural and explained that the Turtle was swimming due North.\n\nFrom now on I\u2019ll be the one asking my daughter about my Halloween costume before I wear it outside.", "description": "When you're young, sometimes a costume is just a costume.
