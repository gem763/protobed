Now, in Ian McEwan\u2019s unexpected new project, Jim Sams wakes and finds he must endure a worse fate: he has become the British prime minister.\n\nAnnounced on Thursday, and to be published in just two weeks time on 27 September, The Cockroach is McEwan\u2019s 16th work of fiction and his second to be published this year, after the novel Machines Like Me. Following the transformation, Sams \u2013 who was \u201cignored or loathed\u201d in his previous life \u2013 finds himself with new powers and a new mission: to carry out the will of the people.\n\n\u201cNothing must get in his way: not the opposition, nor the dissenters within his own party,\u201d reads a description by McEwan\u2019s publisher Jonathan Cape. \u201cNot even the rules of parliamentary democracy.\u201d\n\nAnnouncing the book, McEwan said the novella would be \u201cpolitical satire in an old tradition\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs the nation tears itself apart, constitutional norms are set aside, parliament is closed down so that the government cannot be challenged at a crucial time and ministers lie about it shamelessly in the old Soviet style, and when many Brexiters in high places seem to crave the economic catastrophe of a no deal and English nationalist extremists are attacking the police in Parliament Square, a writer is bound to ask what he or she can do. There\u2019s only one answer: write,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMockery might be a therapeutic response, though it\u2019s hardly a solution. But a reckless, self-harming, ugly and alien spirit has entered the minds of certain politicians and newspaper proprietors. They lie to their supporters. They express contempt for the judges and the rule and norms of law. They seem to want to achieve their ends by means of chaos. What\u2019s got into them? A cockroach or two, I suspect.\u201d\n\nThe author has long been a vocal critic of Brexit, describing himself as a \u201cdenialist\u201d. In April, he told the Observer: \u201cSometimes, I wake in the morning wondering what is bearing in on me, and then I remember. Brexit does seem to me a national tragedy. The great lie of the Brexiters, their magic dust, was to persuade 37% of the electorate that the EU, not the UK, was in charge of immigration, and they succeeded.\u201d\n\nIn Machines Like Me, McEwan imagined an alternate Britain in the 1980s led by prime minister Tony Benn, who takes Britain out of the EU. In the book, Benn refuses to have another referendum, because \u201conly the Third Reich and other tyrannies decided policy by plebiscites\u201d, he says, \u201cand generally no good came of them\u201d.", "description": "Out this month, the Kafkaesque novella sees a man wake up as prime minister and is described by the author as a \u2018therapeutic response\u2019 to Brexit turmoil", "authors": ["Sian Cain", "Ian Mcewan"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f438c92496c7d26a05e1e925a25cd27443dc3ec8/0_61_4470_2682/master/4470.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a103192bfdf477c1788a7b6e3a324b4f"}
