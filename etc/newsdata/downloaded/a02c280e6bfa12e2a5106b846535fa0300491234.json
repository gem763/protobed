U.S. gold futures GCcv1 gained\n\n0.8% to $1,516.20 per ounce.\n\n\"The market is holding back, and looking at what's going to\n\nhappen in the U.S.-China trade talks on Thursday... If the trade\n\ndispute turns worse, we are going to expect some strong risk-off\n\ntrade,\" said Phillip Futures analyst Benjamin Lu.\n\n\"The players who were short, rolled back on their positions.\n\nWe are also seeing some weakness on the equity side.\"\n\nThe United States on Tuesday imposed visa restrictions on\n\nChinese officials for the detention or abuse of Muslim\n\nminorities, angering Beijing ahead of high-level trade talks on\n\nThursday and Friday, and sending Asian stocks lower.\n\nThe dollar was a shade lower against a basket of major\n\ncurrencies . MKTS/GLOB USD/\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has said tariffs on Chinese\n\nimports will rise on Oct. 15 if no progress is made in the\n\nnegotiations.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury yield curve steepened in Asia after\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signalled further interest\n\nrate cuts and the resumption of bond purchases to address a\n\nrecent spike in money market rates. Lower interest rates generally reduce the opportunity cost\n\nof holding non-yielding gold and weigh on the dollar.\n\n\"With the latest QE-lite measures, we expect inflow of funds\n\ninto gold-backed ETFs to continue, which is likely to push gold\n\nprices higher. We maintain that gold prices may test as high as\n\n$1,600/oz in this period of uncertainty,\" OCBC Bank said in a\n\nresearch note.\n\nSignals are mixed for spot gold, as it failed to break a\n\nsupport at $1,488 per ounce, said Reuters market analyst, Wang\n\nTao.\n\n\"The psychological $1,500 pivot looms as the first key\n\nsupport for gold, however expect to see interest extend as far\n\nas $1,485,\" MKS PAMP said in a note.\n\nMeanwhile, silver gained 1.2% to $17.91 an ounce,\n\nwhile platinum XPT= rose 0.4% to $892.99. Palladium XPD=\n\ndeclined 0.2% to $1,673.17 an ounce.\n\n\n\n", "description": "PRECIOUS-Gold holds firm as optimism fades for U.S.-China trade talks", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/sign_AUD_USD_b._800x533_L_1414405839.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
