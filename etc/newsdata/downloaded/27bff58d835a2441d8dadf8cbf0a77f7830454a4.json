The \u2018Super Great White Shark\u2019 looks like a flying saucer \u2013 or a robot vacuum.\n\nImages of the circular rotorcraft appeared online on the eve of the fifth China Helicopter Exposition, which officially opened in Tianjin on Thursday. While in the \u201cinitial stage of its design,\u201d according to the machine-translated sign at the exhibit, it is supposed to draw on the \u201cmature\u201d design technologies used in the contemporary US and Russian attack and cargo helicopters.\n\nThe sign also claims that a new \u201cconceptual design of propeller blades has been successfully applied in helicopter design.\u201d\n\nA cutaway schematic of the vehicle that has circulated on the Chinese internet shows two pilots seated in the cockpit mounted in the middle of a giant rotor, encased in the saucer-like body of the helicopter.\n\nAll of the images and video from Tianjin show the prototype sitting on the ground, rather than in flight. If it actually takes to the skies, this would mean that Chinese helicopter designers have finally solved the challenge of making a functioning rotorcraft \u2013 something that has baffled Western inventors since the Second World War.\n\nThe most famous of these experiments has to be the VZ-9 Avrocar, the \u201cflying saucer\u201d developed by Avro Canada in 1958 as a secret weapon for the Cold War. It never overcame the thrust and stability problems, however, and was canceled in 1961.\n\nAs for the \u2018Super Great White Shark,\u2019 some social media users have already noted that it resembles the Roomba family of robotic vacuum cleaners far more than the deep-sea predator it was named after.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
