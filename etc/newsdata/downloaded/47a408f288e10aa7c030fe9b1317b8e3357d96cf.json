So he began getting more aggressive and throwing his curveball more frequently.\n\nPaxton pitched one-hit ball for seven shutout innings, striking out 12 and winning his seventh straight start as the Yankees bounced back in a big way, routing the Texas Rangers 10-1 Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cApproach-wise, for sure, and I think that\u2019s helping my aggressiveness, my mechanics, all my pitches as well,\u201d Paxton said. \u201cMy pitches are better when I\u2019m aggressive and I just let it rip.\u201d\n\nGary S\u00e1nchez hit two home runs, Edwin Encarnaci\u00f3n added a two-run drive in his return from the injured list, and Didi Gregorius and Brett Gardner also connected. The five homers came a day after Mike Minor and the Texas bullpen ended New York\u2019s streak of 220 games without being shut out.\n\nPaxton (12-6) pitched quickly and began with 4 2/3 hitless innings. The left-hander gave up his only hit when Isiah Kiner-Falefa had a clean single to right field.\n\n\u201cHe was on the attack early and often and kind of that unhittable look to him tonight,\u201d manager Aaron Boone said. \u201cObviously he\u2019s been throwing the ball really well of late, but I thought tonight was about as good as he looked.\u201d\n\nPaxton walked one. He matched the longest winning streak of his career and his season-high strikeout total.\n\n\u201cHe was executing pitches like, I mean every ball was on the line, up on the line, down,\u201d Texas manager Chris Woodward said.\n\nPaxton\u2019s winning streak is the longest active streak in the majors, and he became the fifth Yankee since 1940 to win at least seven starts in his first year with the team. The most recent was John Candelaria in 1988.\n\nPaxton also became the fifth Yankee since 1964 to have at least three games of 12 strikeouts in the same season, joining Masahiro Tanaka (2017), Mike Mussina (2001), David Cone (1997) and Al Downing (1967).\n\nDuring his winning streak, Paxton has a 2.98 ERA and is holding hitters to a .170 batting average. He has used his curveball 24.1 percent of the time, up from 13.7 percent in his first 18 starts.\n\nOf his 95 pitches against Texas, Paxton threw the curve 27 times.\n\n\u201cI think the curveball is a big part of it,\u201d Paxton said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a great pitch for me lately. It really just slows guys down. We\u2019re doing a good job of getting it in the dirt where I want to with swings and misses and it looks like my fastball coming out. So, it\u2019s a really good combo with the high fastball.\u201d\n\nS\u00e1nchez homered in the first and sixth innings as the Yankees won for the seventh time in nine games. The catcher broke his career-high with 34 homers and recorded his 14th career multihomer game.\n\nEdinson Volquez (0-1) opened the game for Texas and allowed two runs on one hit. Ariel Jurado followed Volquez and allowed five runs on seven hits in four-plus innings.\n\nThe Yankees became the fifth team in major league history to hit at least 260 homers in a season. New York is six behind its franchise record set last season.\n\nA NEW YORK STORY\n\nScott Heineman hit his first career homer in the Texas ninth, connecting off Jonathan Loaisiga for Texas.\n\nAs Heineman rounded the bases, a ball was thrown back onto the field - a ballboy retrieved it and tossed it to another fan. Yankees PA announcer Paul Olden told the crowd that it was Heineman\u2019s first career homer and he\u2019d like to have the ball.\n\nTurns out the ball that was thrown back was not actually the souvenir ball. But Heineman eventually got the right ball back by making an exchange with Ryan Kindler and his father, Eric, who are from New Jersey.\n\n\u201cObviously it\u2019s something you dream of,\u201d Heineman said. \u201cFor it to happen here, it\u2019s just funny the way the world works, because both my parents are from New York. So, I\u2019ve got family here, my dad\u2019s side of the family is all in the stands, and it was pretty cool.\u201d\n\nHeineman\u2019s older brother, Tyler, recently got called up by Miami and is ready to make his major league debut. Their parents were in Pittsburgh to watch Tyler while his sisters, and an aunt and a few cousins attended the game in the Bronx.\n\nCROWDED\n\nThe Yankees announced a crowd of 33,711 to go over the 3 million mark for a major league-record 21st straight season.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nYankees: RHP Luis Severino (right rotator cuff inflammation/strained lat) is expected to throw 55 pitches in his next rehab start Friday for Triple-A Scranton-Wilkes/Barre. \u2026 RHP Dellin Betances (right shoulder impingement) faced hitters in live batting practice and could appear in a rehab game later this week. . OF Giancarlo Stanton (right knee sprain) faced Betances in batting practice and hit a home run.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRHP Lance Lynn (14-9, 3.77), who last won 15 games in 2014 for St. Louis starts for Texas on Wednesday. The Yankees will use Chad Green (2-4, 5.01) as an opener on Wednesday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Off to a slow start in his first year with the New York Yankees, James Paxton decided something had to change with his approach.
