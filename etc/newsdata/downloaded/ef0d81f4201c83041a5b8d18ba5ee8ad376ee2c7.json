No.\u201d\n\nAccording to her math, that extra $3 a day spent on a caffeine fix could balloon into $1 million after 40 years in a Roth IRA.\n\nRead: This is \u2018the stupidest comment\u2019 Orman has ever read\n\nBut without pointing specifically at Orman, Sallie Krawcheck, the longtime Wall Street exec who now runs Ellevest, tells CNBC the idea that we should skip our daily coffee is \u201cterrible advice\u201d and there are \u201clayers of things\u201d wrong with it.\n\nHere\u2019s just one of those layers:\n\n\u2018We\u2019re sitting here talking about lattes, when, with young women, we really do need to acknowledge the gender pay gap that exists. Our efforts need to be put into changing the inequities, as opposed to making people feel this sense of guilt and shame over having a lovely cup of coffee in the morning.\u2019\n\nAlong with the bigger-picture issues that she believes the younger generation should be more focused on, Krawcheck also talked about the practical matters of how to approach savings. She pointed to the 50-30-20 formula: 50% on income to your needs, 30% to the fun stuff and 20% to savings.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re only on this earth a short amount of time,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to have fun.\u201d\n\nWatch Krawcheck\u2019s full take:", "description": "Earlier this year, Suze Orman, with a net worth well into eight figures, said nobody should be buying a daily cup of coffee.
