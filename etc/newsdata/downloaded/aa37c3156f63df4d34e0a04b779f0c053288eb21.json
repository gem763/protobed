I love having a busy house, though, it just feels really natural to me.\u201d\n\nShe also opened up on finding balance, as she said: \"You\u2019ve got the school run, you\u2019ve got homework, you\u2019ve got after-school clubs, play dates and toddler groups. It\u2019s finding that balance and not feeling guilty about leaving them to have an hour to yourself.\n\n\"It\u2019s hard as a mum and you\u2019ve just got to listen to your body, go with whatever feels right to you and follow your heart.\"\n\n(Image: Brett D. Cove / SplashNews.com)\n\nThe bombshell also revealed that the lack of sleep has left her feeling like a \"zombie\" especially as her two middle children Liberty and Johnny wake up in the night when little Jack does, which has resulted in her \"literally running on empty.\"\n\nPeter and Abbey waited six-weeks after she gave birth before announcing the name they had chosen for their latest addiiton.\n\nThe news came after he joked that the little one was called Divock Samrat, named after Liverpool FC star Divock Origi and his favourite curry house.\n\nWriting in the Daily Mail , Peter said: \"We have just welcomed our fourth child, Jack, into the family and the wonderful chaos that comes with a new baby means it hasn't really hit me that I haven't gone back for pre-season training.\n\n(Image: abbeyclancyofficial/Instagram)\n\n\"Life is hectic in a brilliant way.\"\n\nPeter had announced Jack's birth on his Twitter page when the baby boy was just a day old.\n\nHe wrote: \"Our beautiful baby boy was born Monday 3rd June mother and baby Divock Samrat Crouch are doing well.\"\n\nThe sportsman later revealed that the name had been a joke on That Peter Crouch Podcast \u2014 and said Abbey had been in on the gag.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nHe said: \"He might get bullied if his name is Divock. I had to actually come out and say his name isn't actually Divock Samrat - that was a gag.\n\n\"To me Divrock was a lovely name. Abs said to me, 'You've got to tweet it, it's brilliant.'\"\n\nHe later returned to Twitter to assure his fans the name was just banter.\n\nYou can read the entire interview in OK! magazine which is out now!", "description": "The mother-of-four has spoken candidly about family life with her footballer husband Peter Crouch", "authors": ["Sara-Aisha Kent", "Image", "Brett D.
