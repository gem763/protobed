It can target genes in a specific location -- for instance, to disrupt a mutation.\n\nAbout two-thirds of known human genetic variants associated with diseases are single point gene mutations, so gene editing has the potential to correct or reproduce such mutations.", "description": "Scientists have developed a new gene-editing technology that could potentially correct up to 89% of genetic defects, including those that cause diseases like sickle cell anemia.", "authors": ["Jessie Yeung"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151030155423-pioneers-crispr-dna-gene-editing-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
