It gave no further details.\n\nPutin invited Erdogan \"for a working visit in the coming days\", the Russian leader's office said on Tuesday. \"The invitation was accepted,\" it added.\n\nDmitry Peskov, spokesman for Putin, meanwhile, denied speculation that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would join the Russian and Turkish leaders for trilateral talks. Russia is Syria's main military backer.\n\nLast week, US President Donald Trump abruptly announced the withdrawal of US troops from the northeast region of Syria, clearing the way for a cross-border military campaign by Turkey.\n\nTurkey's offensive, now into its eighth day, is aimed at pushing back Kurdish-led forces from the border area and creating a \"safe-zone\" for the return of Syrian refugees.\n\nAnkara regards the Syrian Kurdish fighters as \"terrorists\" linked to Kurdish separatists on its soil.\n\nFollowing the US withdrawal, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) pivoted to an unlikely alliance with the Syrian government, who have since deployed troops to the border region.\n\nRussia and Iran are staunch allies of the Syrian government and Moscow has moved quickly to fill the void left by the US troops' withdrawal, deploying its military to act as a buffer as Syrian government forces moved north under the deal with the Syrian Kurdish forces.", "description": "Turkish presidency says Erdogan will hold talks with Putin over Ankara's military offensive in Syria on October 22.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/16/d348ab7b7373449781ee1ce6752deba6_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
