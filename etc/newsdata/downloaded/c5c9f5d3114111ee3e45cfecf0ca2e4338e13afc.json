But according to multiple accounts from passengers whose flights later this month have been cancelled, BA is still not honouring its obligations in every case.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The European air passengers\u2019 rights rules require her to be offered a flight on the same route on the same day if seats are available, as they are on Virgin Atlantic. Another option is Norwegian from Gatwick to Seattle.\n\nBut Ms Atkins said that when she called British Airways, she was refused a seat on either airline: \u201cThey\u2019ve said they can't book on Virgin or Norwegian. They said they only have agreements with about 20 airlines.\u201d\n\nMs Atkins accepted the offer of a flight a day earlier on BA. The airline neglected to tell her that it is obliged to book and pay for a hotel for her, as well as providing meals during her extended stay. Instead she paid $290 (\u00a3233) for a hotel room.\n\nThe Independent raised her case, one of many received on the same issue, with British Airways. A spokesperson said: \u201cWe have offered all customers who are affected the option to take a full refund or to rebook on an alternative date or airline.\n\n\u201cWe have been working with more than 50 airlines to ensure that customers have as many alternatives as possible to fit their plans.\u201d\n\nThe airline did not address the refusal to offer Ms Atkins a different flight on the same day on Virgin Atlantic or Norwegian, nor its failure to offer and provide hotel accommodation.\n\nOn ba.com, British Airways says: \u201cYou should keep your receipts for any other costs directly incurred as a result of the cancellation, these will be considered on an individual basis.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is responsible for enforcing the EU rules in the UK, said: \u201cWe are aware of the planned industrial action affecting British Airways passengers on 27 September.\n\n\u201cWe will be reminding the airline of its legal obligations to passengers during any period of disruption.\n\n\u201cPassengers who have seen their flights cancelled should be offered the choice of a full refund or alternate travel arrangements under comparable conditions at the earliest opportunity, which includes flights on other airlines, or a new flight at a later date at the passenger\u2019s convenience.\n\n\u201cWe also expect the airline to proactively provide passengers with information about their rights when flights are cancelled.\n\n\u201cPassengers with concerns should contact us at passengercomplaints@caa.co.uk.\"\n\nBritish Airways announced the cancellations on Thursday, the last possible day before it would have had to pay compensation under the European air passengers\u2019 rights rules.\n\nBalpa has warned: \u201cShould British Airways refuse meaningful negotiations, further strike dates will be considered by the Balpa national executive team.\u201d\n\nBut the union has flatly rejected claims on the front page of The Sun that it plans a 10-day strike in November. \u201cThis is nonsense as we told The Sun,\u201d tweeted Balpa.", "description": "After cancelling hundreds of flights as a result of the bitter pilots\u2019 pay dispute, British Airways is failing to comply with its obligations to some passengers.
