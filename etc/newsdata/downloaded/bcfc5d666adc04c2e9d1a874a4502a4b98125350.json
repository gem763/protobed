Murphy Veterans Affairs Medical Center on Thursday.\n\nThe animal shelter\u2019s Facebook post said Vincent \u201chas no family in New Mexico so had to surrender his beloved dog, Patch to us.\u201d\n\nThe post continued:\n\nJohn Vincent may not have much time left said Amy Neal, a palliative care social worker and he had only one request. Vincent wanted to see his dog one last time. Yesterday we were able to make their final reunion happen. Our AWD Director, Danny Nevarez, along with team members Joel Craig, Desiree Cawley and Celina Chavez-Fennell took Patch down to the Hospice Center for the reunion. It was such a heart warming moment! They were so happy to see each other and to say their good byes. It was an honor to make this veterans final wish come true.\n\nThe animal shelter could not pass up the chance to reunite the two when they heard Vincent did not have much time left.\n\n\u201cWhen the request came in, it was an immediate \u2018absolutely,\u2019 and let\u2019s do whatever we can to get it done,\u201d said Nevarez.\n\n\u201cIt was as simple as getting Patch over here,\u201d he noted.\n\nNevarez said the little Yorkie was \u201cas quiet as can be\u201d on his ride to the medical center where his master was waiting for him. But once they neared the building, Patch began to make noise.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like he knew, he just started whimpering,\u201d Nevarez commented.\n\nVincent served as a United States Marine for three years in Vietnam, and upon his return home, lived in Wyoming, Alaska, and New Mexico.\n\nHe got Patch from a neighbor\u2019s litter and said he wanted a dog small enough to ride on his Harley Davidson motorcycle with him.\n\n\u201cThe only hair I had was on my chin, which was called a patch. \u2026 And he had a little white patch, so we were the patch brothers,\u201d the veteran recalled.\n\nWhen Vincent retired, he and the dog would take long walks together every evening until he was admitted to hospice care.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about \u2018what can we do to enhance his life?\u2019 Because it\u2019s about living here when they come here \u2026 and this is living for him,\u201d Neal said of the touching reunion.\n\nThe Albuquerque Animal Welfare said Patch is now back at the shelter and someone is already interested in adopting him.", "description": "A veteran on hospice was able to say a final farewell to his beloved dog this week in Albuquerque, New Mexico.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/patrch-dog-reunited-veteran-owner-albuquerque-animal-welfare-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
