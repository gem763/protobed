However, the remarks conflicted with U.S. President Donald Trump's comments on Monday that he expected to sign a significant part of the trade deal with China ahead of schedule.\n\nTrump's comments had lifted global stock markets and sent the Nikkei to its the highest point in more than a year on Tuesday.\n\nInvestors also avoided taking big long positions before a U.S. Federal Reserve policy decision later on Wednesday and a Bank of Japan meeting on Thursday.\n\n\"Investors are booking some profits, and there are some position adjustments before the Fed and the BOJ,\" said Yutaka Masushima, market analyst at Monex Securities in Tokyo. \"Trump said there was a lot of progress in trade talks, but past experience shows his comments have betrayed expectations, so there is some caution.\"\n\nThere were 143 decliners on the Nikkei index against 79 advancers on Wednesday.\n\nThe largest percentage losses in the index were electronics manufacturer NEC Corp, down 5.83%, followed by rival electronics manufacturer Omron Corp losing 5.17% and Kobe Steel Ltd down by 4.77%.\n\nPackaged food maker Nisshin Seifun Group Inc jumped 8.96%, electronics conglomerate Fujitsu Ltd rallied 7.74% and cosmetics maker Shiseido Co Ltd rose by 3.98%.\n\nThe broader Topix index added 0.19% to 1,665.90. It earlier reached its highest level since Dec. 4, 2018.\n\nThe volume of shares traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's main board was 1.79 billion, compared with the average of 1.24 billion in the past 30 days.
