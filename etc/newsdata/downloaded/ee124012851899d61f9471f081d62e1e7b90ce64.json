Moore-Brick also concluded that the tower\u2019s cladding failed to comply with building regulations.\n\nThe tone of the whole inquiry has been mostly blaming the firefighters \u2013 with no historical context, ultimately letting the government and private companies off the hook with \u2018extra time\u2019 (Picture: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images)\n\nLet\u2019s hope there is money in the coffers to implement these changes.\n\nHowever, there are no recommendations for the fitting of sprinkler systems or for a complete ban on the use of combustible materials on high-rise buildings.\n\nAccording to Moore-Brick, this will be looked at in phase two \u2013 which reveals the lack of urgency by the government to remove current combustible cladding.\n\nIf we are to prevent this from happening again, more urgency is needed. This should have been the focus of the inquiry from the beginning.\n\nIn 2009, six people were tragically killed in a fire at Lakanal House in Camberwell, after which the coroner made a series of safety recommendations for the government to consider.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese recommendations were sat on by then housing minister Gavin Barwell, who delayed a fire safety review in changes to building regulations for high-rises after these deaths.\n\nThis had devastating effects for what would eventually happen at Grenfell eight years later.\n\nMany political parties\u2019 decisions were implicated, including the government at all levels: the council; the planning department; the building management company (KCTMO); building inspectors and the building industry as a whole \u2013 from architects to contractors, manufacturers and retailers.\n\nHow could they all have failed in their professional responsibilities and in their duties of care so abysmally?\n\nLeft unchecked, the social, economic and political forces that led to Grenfell will no doubt lead to further horrific \u2013 but predictable and preventable \u2013 disasters.\n\nPeeling back every layer of the Grenfell disaster, it seems to me that the same issues are at play.\n\nRegulations were relaxed and eliminated, warnings were ignored and costs were cut, while profits and council reserves increased \u2013 all to the detriment of hard-working citizens, the poor and the powerless with many lives lost, solely for the benefit of the wealthy and powerful.\n\nAction has to be taken now \u2013 it is what the bereaved families and survivors want.\n\nIf the inquiry had begun with act one scene one, the recommendations would look starkly different.\n\nThen, the real \u2018villains of the piece\u2019 would be in the media headlines, rather than the firefighters who risked their own lives to save people in a building that no-one should have been living in, with a fire that was unprecedented.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAny type of disaster is possible given the huge scope of past and present governments\u2019 extreme erosion of safety standards through programmes of deregulation, privatisation, outsourcing/subcontracting, localism and austerity.\n\nThe inquiry must fully investigate all such issues. The fire was simply the final act in a long line of actions that appear to me to have led, inevitably but predictably, to the Grenfell Tower fire and its attendant loss of life.\n\nLeft unchecked, the social, economic and political forces that led to Grenfell will no doubt lead to further horrific \u2013 but predictable and preventable \u2013 disasters.\n\nI am also minded that there is nothing on the statute books that makes it mandatory for a government to act on any public inquiry\u2019s recommendations.\n\nThis will be about political will, so let\u2019s hope they will.\n\nRIP to all those lives taken in this tragedy.\n\nMORE: Grenfell Tower fire survivors \u2018failed by NHS mental health professionals\u2019\n\nMORE: Our government owes nothing to Notre Dame and everything to the people of Grenfell\n\nMORE: The horror of losing my family at Grenfell will never leave me \u2013 the burning effigy video made it worse", "description": "Justice4Grenfell's Yvette Williams writes on the Grenfell Tower fire report and why focus should have been on the Government's actions.", "authors": ["Yvette Williams", "Coordinator Of Justice Grenfell."], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1150128028-e1572432959276_1572437546.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
