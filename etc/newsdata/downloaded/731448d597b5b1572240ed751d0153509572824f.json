Prices had firmed 0.5% last week on fears of cooling\n\nglobal growth.\n\nU.S. gold futures GCcv1 were little changed at $1,513.30\n\nper ounce.\n\nThere is uncertainty regarding the trade negotiations. China\n\nseems to be very reluctant to agree, said Margaret Yang Yan, a\n\nmarket analyst at CMC Markets. \"There is demand for safe haven\n\nassets, which reflects a very cautious mood towards the trade\n\ndeal.\"\n\nThe next round of U.S-China trade negotiations are slated to\n\nbe held in Washington on Oct. 10-11, though hopes of progress\n\ndiminished after Bloomberg reported that Chinese officials\n\nwanted the scope of this week's negotiations to be narrow.\n\n\"Gold has been in a range of less than $100. It will take a\n\nstrong catalyst to bring gold out of this channel,\" Yan said,\n\nadding that quantitative easing by the Fed, European Central\n\nBank and Bank of Japan could be a major factor.\n\nA report on Friday showed jobs growth in the United States\n\nslowed in September and wage growth stalled, even as\n\nunemployment dropped to a 50-year low.\n\nBut that did little to change market expectations that the\n\nFed will cut likely interest rates at its next policy review on\n\nOct. 29-30 to support the economy. Lower interest rates reduce\n\nthe opportunity cost of holding non-yielding gold. Meanwhile, China's foreign exchange reserves fell more than\n\nexpected in September amid a cooling domestic economy and the\n\nrising trade tensions.
