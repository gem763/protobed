It is a condition in which shaving causes inflammation and bumps to develop on the skin.\n\nNavy officials cited concerns such as ensuring a proper seal while using breathing devices as a major factor in the decision to crack down on beards. In the past, sailors could be issued a permanent \u201cno shaving waiver\u201d to grow facial hair. Under the new directive from the Navy, that\u2019s no longer the case.\n\n\u201cIt is the responsibility of every sailor in every naval environment to maintain personal readiness and safety,\u201d Navy officials said in the directive. \u201cNavy grooming standards and requirements are aligned in support of achieving and maintaining personal readiness and safety regardless of assignment or duties.\u201d\n\nAccording to the internal Navy letter, sailors who have been diagnosed with PFB or \u201crazor bumps\u201d will have six months to be reevaluated by medical personnel. Afterward, those making new complaints about razor bumps will undergo medical treatment\n\nSailors who don\u2019t follow the medical plan can face disciplinary actions, Navy officials said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
