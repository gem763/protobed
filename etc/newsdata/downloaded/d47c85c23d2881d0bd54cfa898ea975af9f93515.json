No matter who, or when, or what they're wearing (or not!), love wins in these three must-read romances.\n\nBringing Down the Duke by Evie Dunmore brings a charming twist to a classic romance plot. It is England in 1879, and a suffragist organization has given Annabelle Archer the opportunity of a lifetime: a scholarship to be one of first female students at Oxford University. She just has to help them lobby powerful political men for their support for their cause, the Married Women's Property Act. There is one man in particular she must convince: Sebastian, the Duke of Montgomery.\n\nMontgomery is every alpha duke you've ever met: in command of all and everyone in his world, in possession of everything he could ever want \u2014 except his family seat (lost in a game of cards by the previous duke) and Annabelle Archer. There is nothing quite so satisfying as seeing such a man brought to his knees by a beautiful woman with nothing to her name except an inviolable sense of her own self-worth. The suffragist subplot brings a new dimension to their dynamic, and it forces the duke to do the most romantic thing of all: change history for love.\n\nWell Met by Jen Deluca Paperback, 328 pages | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming.
