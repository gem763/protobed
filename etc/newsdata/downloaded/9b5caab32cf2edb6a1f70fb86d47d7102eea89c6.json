Robert Whittaker at UFC 243: Best photos view 27 images\n\nWelcome to The Israel Adesanya Era.\n\nJust 18 months after making his UFC debut, the New Zealand kickboxer by way of Nigeria completed his breathtaking ascent to stardom, as he clobbered Robert Whittaker to claim the undisputed UFC middleweight championship on Saturday night.\n\nIn front of a big crowd at Marvel Stadium in Melbourne, Australia, Adesanya (18-0 MMA, 7-0 UFC), who entered the bout as interim champion, knocked out Whittaker (20-5 MMA, 11-3 UFC) at the 3:33 mark of the second round to unify the title.\n\n\u201cHe threw everything we expected. We had everything planned from Plan A to Z,\u201d Adesanya said. \u201cIt\u2018s unreal. They said I have no knockout power.\u201d\n\nWhittaker, who hadn\u2019t fought since June 2018, came out loading up his shots, catching Adesanya several times over the course of the first round with jabs, hooks and overhands. As the round progressed, though, you could see Adesanya figure out his range and begin to strike back. Adesanya saved his best for last as he dropped Whittaker to the mat with a count-right that landed flush on the jaw a split second before the horn sounded to end Round 1.\n\nAdesanya drops Whittaker as the horn sounds in round 1!

Whittaker still threw bombs, but Adesanya effortlessly slipped them, and then responded with crisp counter combinations.\n\nIt was one of those combos that spelled the end. Whittaker landed flush on the face with a straight shot, but Adesanya, in the blink of an eye, landed a counter right, and then the big blow, a left on the jaw that knocked out Whittaker and ended the bout.\n\n\u201cHe caught me with a nice one, but I returned,\u201d Adesanya said. \u201cI eat it, but give it back two times. That\u2019s a two-piece right there. I can take it and give it back. He\u2019s right; I hate to get hit. It\u2019s stupid to get hit. I\u2019m tough and smart. At the end of the day, my team and I were smart.\u201d\n\nThe victory was Adesanya\u2019s fifth finish in his seven UFC fights. Whittaker had a nine-fight winning streak, which dated back to 2014, snapped with the loss.\n\n\u201cMy hat is off to Adesanya,\u201d the no-nonsense Whitaker said. \u201cHe\u2019s very strong, I thought I was doing well and then I got caught. \u2026 I didn\u2019t get the \u2018W\u2019 today, but I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d\n\nAfter the bout, Adesanya called out top contender Paulo Costa, who was seated cageside and exchanged gestures with the newly crowned champ.\n\n\u201cYou know who\u2019s next,\u201d Adesanya said. \u201cI have a heavy Ricky Martin wannabe next. \u2018Borrachinha.\u2019 This is my octagon. I\u2019m going to smash him. I want to rearrange his face.\u201d\n\nUp-to-the-minute UFC 243 results include:", "description": "The era of \"The Last Style Bender\" is upon us, as Israel Adesanya rolled to victory to unify the UFC middleweight title.", "authors": ["Dave Doyle", "John Morgan", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Blue Corner", "Ken Hathaway", "Mike Bohn"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/israel-adesanya-robert-whittaker-ufc-243-10.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
