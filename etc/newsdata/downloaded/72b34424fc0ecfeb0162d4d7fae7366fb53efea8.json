The plan has been formally withdrawn, but it is unlikely to end the unrest as it meets only one of five demands pro-democracy protesters have made.\n\nOn Tuesday, authorities announced $255m in relief measures for the city's economy - particularly in its transport, tourism and retail industries. This followed a more sizeable $2.4bn package in August to support underprivileged people and businesses.\n\nThe Hang Seng, one of Asia's most prominent share markets, is down 12 percent since the protests started. Although it has been recovering some ground over the last two months, it has continued to lag behind other major markets.\n\nLebanon\n\nHundreds of thousands of people have been flooding the streets of Lebanon for nearly two weeks, furious at a political class they accuse of pushing the economy to the point of collapse.\n\nPrime Minister Saad Hariri announced on Monday a symbolic halving of the salaries of ministers and lawmakers, as well as steps towards implementing long-delayed measures vital to fixing the finances of the heavily indebted state.\n\nMarkets are increasingly worried it will all end in default. The government's bonds are now selling at a 40 percent discount, as credit default swaps - which investors use as insurance against those risks - have soared.\n\nIraq\n\nSimilar factors were behind deadly civil unrest in Iraq that flared in early October. More than 100 people died in violent protests across a country where many citizens, especially young people, felt they had seen few economic benefits since fighters from the ISIL group were defeated in 2017.\n\nThe government responded with a 17-point plan to increase subsidised housing for the poor and stipends for the unemployed, as well as training programmes and small loans initiatives for unemployed youth.\n\nEgypt\n\nProtests against President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi broke out in Cairo and other cities across Egypt in September following online calls for demonstrations against alleged government corruption, as well as recent austerity-focused measures.\n\nProtests are rare under the former army chief, and about 3,400 people have been arrested since they began, including about 300 protesters who have since been released, according to the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms, an independent body.\n\nThe country's main stock market dropped 10 percent over three days as the demonstrations kicked off, although it has since recovered over half of that ground.\n\nBeginning in late 2010, anti-government protests roiled Tunisia. By early 2011, they had spread into what became known as the Arab Spring wave of protests and uprisings, which ended up toppling not only Tunisia's leader but those of Egypt, Libya and Yemen, too. The uprising in Syria developed into a civil war that continues to be waged today.\n\nEthiopia\n\nA total of 16 people have been killed in at least four cities since fierce clashes broke out on Wednesday against the reformist policies of Nobel Prize-winning Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed.\n\nThe greater freedoms that those policies bring have unleashed long-repressed tensions between Ethiopia's many ethnic groups, as local politicians claim more resources, power and land for their own regions. Ethiopia is due to hold elections next year.\n\nChile\n\nAt least 15 people have died in Chile in protests that started over a hike in public transport costs, but have grown to reflect simmering anger over intense economic inequality as well as costly health, education and pension systems seen by many as inadequate.\n\nChilean President Sebastian Pinera announced an ambitious raft of measures on Tuesday aimed at quelling the unrest - including a guaranteed minimum wage, a hike in the state pension offering and the stabilisation of electricity costs.\n\nEcuador\n\nViolent protests at the start of October forced Ecuadorean President Lenin Moreno to scrap his own law to cut expensive fuel subsidies that have been in place for four decades.\n\nEcuador had estimated the cuts would have freed up nearly $1.5bn per year in the government budget, helping to shrink the fiscal deficit as part of a $4.2bn IMF loan deal that Moreno had signed.\n\nBolivia\n\nMass protests and marches broke out in Bolivia this week after the opposition said that vote-counting in the country's presidential election over the weekend was rigged in favour of current leader Evo Morales.\n\nThe unrest - already the biggest test of Morales's rule since he came to power in 2006 - could spread if his declaration of outright victory is confirmed. Monitors, foreign governments and the opposition already called for a second-round vote.\n\nFrance\n\nThe Gilets Jaunes movement named after the fluorescent yellow safety vests that all French motorists must carry began a year ago to oppose fuel-tax increases, but quickly morphed into a broader backlash against President Emmanuel Macron, rising economic inequality and climate change.\n\nMacron swiftly reversed the tax hikes and announced a range of other measures worth more than 10 billion euros ($11.1bn) to boost the purchasing power of lower-income voters in France. That was followed up with another package of tax cuts in April.\n\nExtinction Rebellion\n\nThis London-bred movement is pushing for political, economic and social changes to avert the worst devastation of climate change. Extinction Rebellion protesters began blockading streets and occupying prominent public spaces late last year.\n\nFollowing 11 days of back-to-back protests in April, the United Kingdom government symbolically declared a \"climate emergency\". The movement is developing alongside the growing #FridaysForFuture movement led by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg and prompting schoolchildren to boycott class on Fridays.\n\nGlobal warming protests have been particularly strong in Germany, where the government there recently launched a policy specifying that any spending pushing the government's budget into deficit must be on climate-focused investments.\n\nIncoming European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has also introduced an ambitious European Green Deal that would include the support of 1 trillion euros ($1.11 trillion) in sustainable investments across the bloc.", "description": "In Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East and South America, street protests are spooking investors.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/24/fd3a1a13f07d4373a63faa708d1496e1_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
