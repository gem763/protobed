His penis also became 'buried' in the swollen flesh.\n\nThe only course of action was emergency surgery to remove all the infected tissue in a series of complicated procedures.\n\nA massive hernia containing part of his bowel had caused severe swelling. (CT scan)\n\nA 43-year-old man was forced to have his scrotum chopped off after is became so swollen it hung below his knees and began rotting, doctors have revealed\n\nDoctors in Texas, led by Dr Katherine Dowd, Baylor Scott and White Health, detailed the case in Urology Case Reports.\n\nThe report said the man hadn't seen a doctor for years before arriving at an A&E department in Panama with a fever, fast heart rate and clear ballooning of his scrotum.\n\nShocking images show the extent of the damage to the man's scrotum, which had started to become gangrenous.\n\nWHAT CAUSED THE HUGE SCROTUM? The unidentified man's scrotum gradually grew over three decades. He hadn't seen a doctor in many years, and things had escalated. A CT scan revealed a inguinal hernia, which occurs when tissue from the bowel protrudes through the abdominal muscles. Risk factors include being a male, older, chornic constipation and a family history.\n\nChronic, massive lymphedema followed. Lymphadema is swelling that results from a blockage in the lymphatic system, which is part of your immune system. The blockage prevents lymph fluid from draining properly, causing swelling.\n\nComplications of lymphedema include serious infections. The man had developed Fournier's gangrene, a life threatening infection that causes skin and tissues on the genitals to rot.\n\nA hydrocele had developed in the scrotum, occurring when fluid collects in the thin sheath surrounding a testicle. It can be caused by injury of inflammation in the scrotum.\n\nAlthough his testicles were removed, his penis remained in tact, and it is understood he is now recovering.\n\nWhen he arrived at hospital, it was revealed he relied on his mother for basic daily needs. His medical history was limited.\n\nOn examination, the skin was thickened, a deep red, with two open and infected wounds.\n\nScans showed an inguinal hernia, which is when tissue, such as part of the intestine, protrudes through a weak spot in the abdominal muscles.\n\nIt can lead to life-threatening complications if it's not treated, and the doctors said it had caused lymphedema.\n\nLymphoedema develops when the flow of the lymphatic system gets damaged and fluid cannot move properly.\n\nThere are various causes including cancer surgery, radiotherapy, infections and skin inflammation.\n\nConcerned about the rotting flesh, called Fournier's gangrene, the patient's declining condition, and risk of sepsis, doctors rushed the man into surgery.\n\nThey removed the infected skin and tissue, but found further open wounds under the skin.\n\nPlastic surgeons stitched the man's scrotum area back together with a graft made of mesh\n\nThe next day, doctors worked to remove more of the dead flesh.\n\nOver the next five days, the man remained in hospital on antibiotics via an IV line. But he was in so much agony, it was too difficult to change the dressing on his wounds.\n\nThe decision to remove the scrotum was made to bring the man's trauma to an end.\n\nThe hydrocele - the medical term for the type of swelling in the scrotum - measured 30.2cm x 24.4cm x 13.1cm (12in x 10in x 5in) in size.\n\nPlastic surgeons stitched the man's scrotum area back together with a graft made of mesh.\n\nTwo days later he was discharged to a rehabilitation facility. Four weeks later, doctors said he was healing well.\n\nThey said: 'With this treatment plan, initial debridement followed by a staged repair on day three and day eight, the patient was spared prolonged wound care, painful dressing changes, without sacrificing cosmetic and functional outcomes.'\n\n", "description": "The man, who has not been identified, had been suffering for three decades.
