(Ryan M. Kelly/Getty Images)\n\nThe Virginia Cavaliers have established themselves as legitimate contenders for their first ACC Coastal Division football title. This weekend, they will step onto the national stage.\n\nThe Cavaliers will play at Notre Dame for the first time in program history Saturday and will do so with the team\u2019s highest ranking since 2007.\n\n\u201cPut it this way,\u201d Cavaliers Coach Bronco Mendenhall said. \u201cThe number of times this year already I\u2019ve heard, \u2018This is the first time since,\u2019 the number of sentences that have started with that after the game when someone walks up, and there is some year and some metric.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of cool and positive things happening in our program. There will always be another metric, and this is the next one.\u201d\n\n[Terps' Josh Jackson, facing Penn State after his worst game, chalks it up as an \u2018outlier\u2019]\n\nThe 18th-ranked Cavaliers already have made significant strides from last year, winning four games to open a season for the first time since 2004 and validating preseason predictions of a Coastal title.\n\nBut without reigning national champion Clemson on the schedule until perhaps the ACC title game, Virginia\u2019s best chance to make a sweeping impression during the regular season comes at storied Notre Dame Stadium in a game.\n\nThe Fighting Irish, ranked 10th nationally with a 2-1 record, are 20-0 as a ranked team against ACC opponents at home. Notre Dame has played Virginia just twice previously, most recently in 2015 when the Fighting Irish scored the decisive points with 12 seconds remaining to secure a 34-27 win at Scott Stadium.\n\n\u201cI mean, I\u2019m excited for it,\u201d Cavaliers defensive tackle Eli Hanback said. \u201cEveryone who likes college football or knows anything about it knows who Notre Dame is, the field there and all that stuff that goes along with it, so it is going to be exciting and a cool experience.\n\n\u201cBut then again we\u2019re going to play a football game. We\u2019re not going there to sightsee or anything like that.\u201d\n\nVirginia players indicated they are expecting a boisterous crowd in South Bend, even with the Fighting Irish coming off a 23-17 loss at No. 3 Georgia last weekend that dealt a blow to their aspirations of reaching the College Football Playoff in consecutive years.\n\nDuring practice this week, Mendenhall had artificial noise, including Notre Dame\u2019s fight song, piped in at deafening decibel levels over the loudspeakers, a common practice for teams going on the road into traditionally high energy environments.\n\nMendenhall is at least somewhat familiar with the atmosphere at one of the sport\u2019s iconic venues from his time as coach of Brigham Young.\n\nThis will be Mendenhall\u2019s fourth game against Notre Dame. He lost all three previous meetings, including in 2012 and 2013 during the Fighting Irish\u2019s early years under Coach Brian Kelly.\n\n\u201cI orchestrate and create crises during the week in as many different ways that I can, and that helps to some extent,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cSo emotion is something and chaos is something we work to create in practice. Again, I try to create as much as possible.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really all you can do other than continue to build your program.\u201d\n\nSilent counts also are part of most game plans when stadium noise is a major concern, although Virginia may be without starting center Olusegun Oluawatimi for the second week in a row. The sophomore missed this past Saturday\u2019s game against Old Dominion with an injured snapping hand.\n\nOluawatimi practiced this week, but Mendenhall did not provide an update as to his status for Notre Dame.\n\nMiscommunication between backup center Tyler Fannin and quarterback Bryce Perkins during a sequence in the second half of the Old Dominion game nearly resulted in disaster.\n\nNot anticipating the snap, Perkins was unable to control the ball and ran backward to try to gather it off the ground. As he was bending down, Old Dominion\u2019s Keion White delivered a crushing hit, and Perkins was slow to get back to his feet. He missed one snap before reentering the game. Virginia had to rally from a 17-point deficit against the Monarchs to win, 28-17.\n\nVirginia\u2019s defense ranks second in the ACC and 14th nationally in total yards allowed at 263.8 yards per game. The Cavaliers also are tied for first in the country in sacks (20), with Jordan Mack\u2019s five the most among linebackers in major college football.\n\n\u201cI know that South Bend is an amazing place,\u201d cornerback Bryce Hall said. \u201cThey\u2019ve had a great tradition, and so it\u2019s going to be an exciting time. I\u2019m excited to go and play there. Obviously when you\u2019re a kid and you hear about Notre Dame and the tradition, it\u2019s hard to get past them, and you know how great they\u2019ve been.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s just going to be like living a childhood dream, going to play against teams like that.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nA referee was shot by a cannon during a college football game\n\nJohn Feinstein: App State, still the biggest little college football program going\n\nCollege football has Rivalry Week, Week Zero and now Redshirt Week\n\nStrip club visit, booster payments get Georgia Tech basketball banned from 2019-20 postseason", "description": "The No. 18 Cavaliers hold their highest national ranking since 2007 as they make the first visit to South Bend in program history.", "authors": ["Gene Wang", "Sports Reporter Covering Local", "National College Football", "Gene Wang Is A Sports Reporter Covering Multiple Beats", "Including Virginia", "Virginia Tech Football", "Basketball", "The Wizards", "Boxing", "Golf.
