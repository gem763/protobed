It will have the exact opposite effect of what they\u2019re claiming it will,\u201d said O\u2019Toole, now a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Nothing more than farce\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe National Iranian American Council said the latest actions would increase the burden for humanitarian trade, amid accounts of Iranians who have gone without vital medicine or medical products.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration has sounded the death knell for humanitarian trade with Iran,\u201d the Iranian American group said in a statement.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear: There is unlikely to be a single banker in the world that will accept these conditions and participate in the trade,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration is surely aware of this fact, and its humanitarian channel should be viewed as nothing more than farce.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Toole, the former Treasury adviser, said that the measure also looked like it was aimed at countering INSTEX, a channel set up by European powers to skirt unilateral US sanctions.\n\n\u201cThis is clearly saying \u2014 okay, we told you INSTEX is bad, this is what you should use, never mind the invasion of US government sovereignty on you,\u201d he said.\n\nEuropean powers have been seeking to salvage a multinational 2015 nuclear accord with Iran, from which Trump withdrew last year.\n\nThrough INSTEX, European businesses are supposed to be insulated from US sanctions, although in reality few companies are willing to take the risk.\n\nThe Trump administration has tried to stop all oil sales by Iran and strangle its economy in a bid to reduce the clerical regime\u2019s support for proxies in the Middle East that fight US allies Saudi Arabia and Israel.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 The United States on Friday asked foreign governments to submit detailed reports on humanitarian exports to Iran, a step", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/9ea291_an-iranian-vendor-sells-fruit-in-tehran-tajrish-bazaar-in-september-2019-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
