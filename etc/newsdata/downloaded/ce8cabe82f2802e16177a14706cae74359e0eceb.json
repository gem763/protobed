I am worried it could happen,\" said Dudu Peretz, 35, as he dropped his son off at kindergarten.\n\nIn southern Lebanon, farmers returned to their fields and the United Nations force tasked with monitoring the border area resumed its patrols, an AFP journalist said.\n\n\"We're used to this kind of thing,\" said Ali al-Safari, a resident of Bint Jbeil on the Lebanese side of the border.\n\n\"We remain determined and calm.\"\n\nSunday's exchange of fire began when Hezbollah fired anti-tank missiles at an Israeli army base near the border community of Avivim and at a vehicle Israel said was a military ambulance, destroying it.\n\nIsrael retaliated with around 100 artillery shells targeting the squad that fired the missiles.\n\nHezbollah said it had destroyed an Israeli military vehicle and killed and wounded those inside -- a claim refuted by Israel.\n\nHezbollah's Al-Manar TV on Monday aired footage purporting to show a missile being launched towards a moving armoured vehicle, before an explosion sends large clouds of white smoke into the sky.\n\nAl-Manar's presenter said two Kornet anti-tank missiles had been fired at the target, 1.5 kilometres (one mile) from the border.\n\n- Drone attack -\n\nAfter the flare-up, Lebanon's Prime Minister Saad Hariri contacted senior US and French officials to urge their countries and the international community to intervene.\n\nThe UN called for restraint and France said it had made \"multiple contacts\" to avert further fire.\n\nThe United States slammed the \"destabilising role\" of Iranian allies in the Middle East and said it \"fully supports Israel's right to self defence\".\n\nThe pre-dawn August 25 attack involved two drones -- one exploded and caused damage to a Hezbollah-run media centre and another crashed without detonating due to technical failure, Hezbollah said.\n\nPresident Michel Aoun, a former army chief, denounced it as a \"declaration of war\".\n\nIt came hours after Israel launched strikes in Syria to prevent what it said was an impending Iranian drone attack on the Jewish state, in which Hezbollah said two of its fighters were killed.\n\nA source connected to Hezbollah called Sunday's fire a response to those deaths, and said a reaction to the alleged drone attack would take place in the air.\n\nOn Monday the Syrian government threw its support behind Hezbollah, whose fighters have since 2013 been fighting on President Bashar al-Assad's side in Syria's civil war.\n\nA source at the ministry of foreign affairs told state news agency SANA that Damascus felt \"pride at the... operation\" against Israel.", "description": "Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah threatened Monday to hit \"deep inside\" Israel, a day after an exchange of fire on the Lebanese-Israeli border sparked fears of a wider conflict between the arch-foes.
