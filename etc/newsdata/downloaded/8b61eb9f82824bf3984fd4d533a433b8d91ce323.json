Criminal gangs, hungry for guns, were particularly active in the surrounding communities at that time. Rivalries abounded; homicides were common.\n\nAccording to Bernardo L\u00f3pez, manager of the Santa Teresa Foundation, three gang members broke into the hacienda, in the hope of stealing the security guards' weapons.\n\nThe men were captured. Instead of handing them over to the police, for certain imprisonment, the rum-maker's chief executive, Alberto Vollmer, offered them a chance to atone for their crime by working unpaid at the distillery for a few months instead.\n\nL\u00f3pez says the gang members agreed. Yet when they eventually reported for work, they showed up with their whole gang \u2014 some 20 other men \u2014 \"saying that if [Vollmer] was offering jobs, they wanted jobs for everyone.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Adriana Loureiro Fern\u00e1ndez for NPR Adriana Loureiro Fern\u00e1ndez for NPR\n\nEager to build bridges with a community with soaring unemployment, and to reduce the threat of gang crime, Vollmer took them in, says L\u00f3pez.\n\nVollmer is a descendant of a German merchant who migrated to Venezuela in 1830. He is also a rugby enthusiast \u2014 having played as a schoolboy \u2014 who believes this rough and rugged sport is character-building because it helps nurture respect, sportsmanship, discipline and humility.\n\nIt would therefore be a good idea, Vollmer concluded, to introduce the gangs to the game.\n\nThis became the starting point of what became Project Alcatraz, a rehabilitation program that Santa Teresa has since expanded to include vocational training, psychological counseling and formal education. The name is both a nod to the notorious California prison and to the gannet bird, which is what alcatraz translates to in English.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Adriana Loureiro Fern\u00e1ndez for NPR Adriana Loureiro Fern\u00e1ndez for NPR\n\nSome 2,000 mostly poor youngsters from the surrounding districts regularly play rugby at the hacienda as part of a preventive program to deter them from joining gangs.\n\n\"They fall in love with our rugby,\" says Luis Daniel \"Chino\" L\u00f3pez, coach of the youth team, as he gazes at his players out on the field wrestling over the ball.\n\nThe hacienda is a kind of refuge for them, he says \u2014 although the realities of life in Venezuela sometimes intrude. \"They sometimes say 'Oh, Chino, I'm hungry,' but we help them with that. Sometimes we give them food.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Adriana Loureiro Fern\u00e1ndez for NPR Adriana Loureiro Fern\u00e1ndez for NPR\n\nAccording to the Santa Teresa Foundation, the Alcatraz project has sharply lowered the homicide rate in the locality in recent years. Crime, however, remains a problem.\n\nGertrudis, a middle-aged widow who lives nearby \u2014 and who wants her full name withheld for fear of reprisals \u2014 says no one in the neighborhood dares go outside after 7 p.m. for fear of being robbed or assaulted.\n\nShe concedes the rugby at the Santa Teresa hacienda might help lower crime, but appears far more concerned about her daily ordeal of lining up to get food from 4 a.m., regular power outages and Venezuela's chronic shortage of medicines.\n\nProject Alcatraz has expanded to include hundreds of prison inmates. Its representatives regularly visit Venezuelan penitentiaries to organize rugby games and recruit players.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Adriana Loureiro Fern\u00e1ndez for NPR Adriana Loureiro Fern\u00e1ndez for NPR\n\nSanta Teresa now hosts a one-day rugby 7-a-side tournament for inmates. At the most recent, in December, 13 prison teams took part, escorted to the estate by prison guards and surrounded by a security ring of National Guard soldiers.\n\n\"Imagine the atmosphere,\" says Bernardo L\u00f3pez of the Santa Teresa Foundation. \"We have 300 inmates in the hacienda, and their handcuffs are taken off. They exchange their uniforms for rugby clothes, and start to play.\n\n\"You can see their families cheering from the bleachers. There are moms, who have come to meet their sons and children who're able to see their fathers. Afterwards, they can hug, and talk.\"\n\nNone of this work has been made easier as Venezuela grapples with economic collapse and a political crisis in which the U.S.-backed opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 has been leading a campaign to oust President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, arguing that he was illegally reelected.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Adriana Loureiro Fern\u00e1ndez for NPR Adriana Loureiro Fern\u00e1ndez for NPR\n\nAs the country's instability deepens, getting gangs to agree to participate in Project Alcatraz has become harder, says L\u00f3pez.\n\n\"Gangs right now in Venezuela are not the gangs that we used to manage in 2003,\" he says. \"Gangs now are huge. We're talking about hundreds of men.\"\n\nYet he's undeterred. Rehabilitation and rugby will continue, he says.\n\n\"We don't do this to sell rum. We sell rum to do this. This is our purpose.\"", "description": "Started by the Santa Teresa rum-maker, Project Alcatraz is a rehabilitation program including vocational training, psychological counseling and rugby \u2014 seen as nurturing respect and discipline.", "authors": ["Philip Reeves"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/07/05/_dsc13671_wide-5a614bdb0917ac4f68bf42f0ed919c3449ccc33d.jpg?s=1400"}
