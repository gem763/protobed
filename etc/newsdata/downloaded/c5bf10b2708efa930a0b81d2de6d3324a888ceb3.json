In this region, from whose indigenous people we got our word \u2014 \u201churacan\u201d \u2014 for the fierce tempests that swirl off the Atlantic in late summer and early fall, hurricanes have long been key to culture.\n\nAnd hurricane songs \u2014 mournful, brave, witty or sad \u2014 are everywhere. Even before 1953, when the United States National Hurricane Center\u2019s move to give storms human names provided clever lyricists with new ways to decry those storms\u2019 capriciousness, iconic songs and singers in the Caribbean were hymning the power of hurricanes \u2014 to make or break leaders, to wreck industries, to force the vulnerable or devastated, at a weekend\u2019s notice, to flee their homes and hunt new ones.\n\nWhen Hurricane Dorian brought this fate to the poor people of the Bahamas, many across that sandy archipelago were no doubt reminded of a famous Bahamian folk song, \u201cRun, Come See Jerusalem,\u201d that a Bahamian calypso singer known as Blind Blake Higgs wrote to recall a harsh storm there in 1929.\n\nIn the \u201950s, the Weavers and other American folkies covered Blake Higgs\u2019s tune. But here on the mainland, hurricanes haven\u2019t historically featured as strongly in our cultural memory. Yes, they\u2019ve marked our past and our cities. But in the American songbook, even our best-known songs about climactic disasters \u2014 from Woody Guthrie\u2019s Dust Bowl ballads to the blues songs about rivers rising and levees breaking \u2014 have tended to be less about storms, per se, than about water.", "description": "When hurricanes are a part of life, people cope and quell their anxiety through their music.", "authors": ["Joshua Jelly-Schapiro"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/28/opinion/28schapiro/28schapiro-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
