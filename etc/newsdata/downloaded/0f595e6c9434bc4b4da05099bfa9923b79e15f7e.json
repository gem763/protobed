Francisco Franco\u2019s death, Spain is wrestling with the dictator\u2019s legacy, no more so than in this village named in his honor.\n\nLaid out in neat rows of mostly one or two-storey whitewashed buildings, Guadiana del Caudillo bears Franco\u2019s self-imposed title of Caudillo, or Leader. Construction began in the late 1940s, in the first decade of Franco\u2019s 36-year dictatorship, alongside other villages also named after Franco or people close to him.\n\nA sign at the entrance to Guadiana del Caudillo, Spain, in March shows an attempt to erase Franco\u2019s legacy in the village Photo: susana vera/Reuters\n\nWhile Spain\u2019s highest court in September cleared the government in Madrid to exhume the long-dead dictator, a battle in this rural village has inflamed passions between those would strip his title from its name and those who say it should remain.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a historic memory, it\u2019s part of the town and part of its past,\u201d said Rosa V\u00e1squez, 44 years old, who has lived here her whole life. She said the long-running dispute has turned neighbor against neighbor. \u201cIt\u2019s starting a war between people,\u201d she said.\n\nMayor Francisco Moreno, a Socialist who campaigned to change the village\u2019s name and erase the historical link to Franco, kicked off the process after his election in May.\n\nThe move sparked outrage in some quarters, including among local supporters of the far-right Vox party, which previously governed this village of roughly 2,500 people near the border with Portugal.\n\nA visitor holds an image of Gen.

Support for Vox has climbed in opinion polls to more than 10%, mirroring inroads made by the right in countries from Hungary to the U.K.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS How should Spain deal with the remnants of Franco\u2019s legacy? Join the conversation below.\n\nOther commentators said that removing links to Franco was a necessary step to consolidating democracy in Spain, as has previously happened in Germany and Italy.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t talk about the Hitler Foundation or the Mussolini Foundation because they do not exist,\u201d said Eduardo Ranz, a lawyer who is working to remove statues and other memorials to Franco.\n\nThere are nearly a dozen other Spanish towns or villages still named for Franco or one of his relatives, said Mr. Ranz. There are thousands of plaques, street names or other commemorations that must be removed, he said.\n\nMr. Moreno, seated at a desk in his modest office overlooking Guadiana del Caudillo\u2019s main square, makes a point of calling himself the mayor of Guadiana, dropping the Caudillo.\n\n\u201cThere are people who lost their parents during the civil war and here is a place that pays homage to the person who killed them. It\u2019s a bit much,\u201d he said.\n\nFranco\u2019s grave, near Madrid. The former dictator is set to be exhumed this week.

Spain\u2019s 2007 Historical Memory Law condemned the Francoist state and ordered the removal of symbols associated with the regime.\n\nDuring a consultation process for the planned name change, Mr. Moreno said, just 3% or 4% of voters registered in the village had voiced opposition.\n\nHe didn\u2019t have a timeline for the official re-christening, citing potential for opposition forces to delay the process. The previous mayor, Antonio Pozo, who supports keeping the name, didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nSome symbols of the Franco regime have already been removed. A plaque commemorating a visit to Guadiana del Caudillo by the dictator and a Francoist eagle of the kind also displayed in Hitler\u2019s Germany and Mussolini\u2019s Italy were torn from the town hall early in October.\n\n\u201cI was lucky enough to be there and felt like justice was being done,\u201d said Ana Plaza, whose family has lived in Guadiana del Caudillo since her grandparents settled here when it was founded.\n\nMs. Plaza is a member of Guadiana Despierta, a citizen-led platform that is campaigning to end the village\u2019s connection with Franco once and for all.\n\n\u201c\u2018The Caudillo\u2019 is the same as \u2018the Fuhrer\u2019 in Germany,\u201d said Marco Antonio Carre\u00f1o, another member of Guadiana Despierta. \u201cImagine there being a village in Germany called something-Fuhrer,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something I have found insulting all my life.\u201d\n\nWrite to Pietro Lombardi at Pietro.Lombardi@dowjones.com", "description": "As Spain prepares to exhume Franco, a village bearing his title is trying to shake free of his memory.", "authors": ["Pietro Lombardi", "Oliver Griffin", "Oliver.Griffin Dowjones.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-118509/social", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
