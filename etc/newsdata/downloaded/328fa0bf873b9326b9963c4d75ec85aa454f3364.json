Just qualifying isn\u2019t enough, the issuing authority\u2013usually the county sheriff\u2013has to approve of you as a person he or she wants to allow to carry a firearm.\n\nThe idea behind \u201cmay issue\u201d is that even if someone has no criminal convictions, the sheriff\u2019s office may know them to be potentially violent and not someone responsible enough to carry a gun.\n\nIn theory.\n\nIn practice, however, \u201cmay issue\u201d laws open the door for corruption. When someone has a say in who can get a permit and who can\u2019t, some people are going to make offers to facilitate them getting permits. This is especially true when you\u2019re talking about an elected official who has to campaign for office. That just makes it easier to hide the corruption.\n\nWhich may well be what happened recently in California.\n\nA manager at an executive security firm received a concealed-weapon permit in Santa Clara County a few months after making by far the biggest single donation supporting Sheriff Laurie Smith\u2019s 2018 re-election, newly released records show, a contribution that is a now a focal point of a corruption probe aimed at her office. The $45,000 donation by Martin Nielsen, who is listed as the executive protection operations and executive projects manager for Seattle-based AS Solution, was made in October 2018 to the Santa Clara County Public Safety Alliance, an independent-expenditure committee that backed Smith\u2019s bid for a sixth term. He was issued a concealed-weapon permit on March 26. Nielsen\u2019s donation dwarfs most of the contributions made either to the committee or directly to Smith\u2019s re-election campaign. The DA investigation first surfaced publicly after a search warrant was served Aug. 2 at the Sheriff\u2019s Office headquarters in North San Jose. This news organization has since confirmed with sources familiar with the investigation that at least one other warrant was served on a high-ranking supervisor in Smith\u2019s office.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t look good, all on its own. Someone makes a big donation then gets a carry permit.\n\nBut, it could happen, right? I mean, post hoc ergo proptor hoc (\u201cafter, therefore because of\u201d) is an informal logical fallacy. It\u2019s suspicious, but not indicative of misbehavior.\n\nUnless, of course, there\u2019s a history of this sort of thing.\n\nThe CCW permit issue has long been a source of criticism for the Sheriff\u2019s Office, and it has dogged Smith every time she has run for re-election in the last decade. Residents over the years have complained about the permitting process and said that the permits appeared to be reserved for high-profile people and VIP types. The records released Thursday show that at least 100 active permits have been issued, many of which are renewals of permits held by judges, prosecutors and reserve police officers. Of the civilian permits currently active \u2014 they have a two-year life span before requiring a renewal evaluation \u2014 seven recipients who had permits either issued or renewed in 2019 donated to Smith\u2019s campaign or an independent committee supporting her. In 2018, eight recipients fit that description. The donations ranged from $100 to $1,000, and it should be noted that some of the civilian permits date back decades, some even before Smith was elected sheriff.\n\nWell, then. Isn\u2019t that interesting.\n\nLook, there\u2019s a saying that power corrupts, but I\u2019m not entirely convinced of it. Instead, I think power is sought out by the corruptible. Once those corruptible people have that power, they\u2019ll use it however they can.\n\nSmith, for example, is alleged to provide permits only for VIPs, including those who donate to her campaign. While these are only allegations and I don\u2019t know Smith personally, therefore can\u2019t really speculate on the veracity of these allegations, I can say that it wouldn\u2019t be the first time something like this happened.\n\nAs Cam noted earlier this week when discussing other allegations against Smith:\n\nThis is another example of why discretionary, or \u201cmay issue\u201d concealed carry policies are a bad idea. They\u2019re ripe for abuse, as we\u2019ve seen in New York City and elsewhere. I personally don\u2019t think you should have to have a license to exercise your right to bear arms, but at least \u201cshall issue\u201d licensing policies remove the ability of corrupt public servants to dole out permits in exchange for cash and prizes.\n\nCam also recounted how open records requests found that many of those issued those permits didn\u2019t have to articulate specific reasons why they needed a permit. Now, I don\u2019t think they should have to, but I also think the rules should apply universally. We don\u2019t know whether Nielsen\u2019s application included a specific reason he warranted a permit or not.\n\nIf it did, I\u2019m fairly sure it didn\u2019t say \u201cbecause I wrote a big, fat check.\u201d\n\nHowever, from the outside, it sure looks that way. Not a good look for Smith or the California permitting process. Not in the least.", "description": "Santa Monica Sheriff Laurie Smith has already been accused of running a pay-to-play permit scheme.
