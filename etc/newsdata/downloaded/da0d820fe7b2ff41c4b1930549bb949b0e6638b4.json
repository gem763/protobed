Pat Toomey. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images congress White House keeps Republicans in suspense over guns Senators involved in gun negotiations believe the Trump administration will provide a proposal soon.\n\nPat Toomey thinks the Senate can get to 60 votes on expanding background checks on firearm sales. Lindsey Graham says a deal on red flag laws is imminent. And the White House has briefed senators on what options are on the table.\n\nBut everyone is still waiting on one person: President Donald Trump.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe Senate left Tuesday evening with no clear indication of what the next steps would be on gun legislation, in the aftermath of several mass shootings during the August recess. Nevertheless, senators involved in gun negotiations said they firmly believed the White House would come through with a proposal soon.\n\nAmong the proposals being discussed: Expanding background checks, grants for states to implement red flag laws, legislation from Sens. Toomey (R-Pa.) and Chris Coons (D-Del.) that would alert local authorities if people fail background checks and crackdowns on straw purchases.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been interested, he\u2019s been engaged, he\u2019s been asking good questions. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s talking out of school, the president is not a gun aficionado,\" Toomey said of the president.\n\nToomey added that \"support from the president is going to be essential but with that support I really think we can get to the 60 votes we need\" on background checks.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

He told reporters on Tuesday that he is open to changing his bill with Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) to expand background checks if it helps increase support.\n\nGraham (R-S.C.) said Tuesday that he\u2019d \u201clike to be able to\u201d support Manchin-Toomey and is hopeful that his own so-called red flag bill with Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) will be part of a broader White House package. Toomey said only noncontroversial items should be included in the package so as not to sink his six-year effort to expand background checks.\n\nNotably, a number of Republicans have stayed flexible on their positioning as the gun debate has unfolded over the past month. Though there would certainly be significant divisions among the GOP, there are enough members advocating for some sort of action to keep prospects alive, if at the whims of an erratic president.\n\n\u201cThe chance to get a deal is now. We haven't had a better chance in a number of years, so we better find common ground. How far we can go I don't know,\" said Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.). \u201cI don't want to tell people there\u2019s nothing we can do when we damn well know there\u2019s got to be something we can do.\"\n\n\u201cIt would be welcome to have the president indicate specifically what he would support,\" said Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah). That would be a feature that would not only inform but also give some Republicans in elections [next] year the kind of political support they might need.\"\n\nThe Graham-Blumenthal proposal, which has yet to be released, would provide grants for states to establish their own red flag laws, under which a family member or law enforcement official could petition a court to remove weapons from an individual who may be a threat to themselves or to others. Both lawmakers are optimistic their legislation will be done soon.\n\n\"Everybody's trying to get something done that would matter,\u201d Graham said. \"It's not going to be the perfect bill but I think it'd be a good bill.\"\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal. | Zach Gibson/Getty Images\n\n\"We're down to the 5-yard line,\" Blumenthal said. \"We're very close. We have a couple of issues to resolve ... . We have a historic opportunity that folks on both sides of the aisle want to seize and the key is the president.\"\n\nEven Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) met with actress and liberal activist Alyssa Milano and Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter was killed in Parkland, Fla. Cruz deemed it a \"positive, civil discussion\" and said Congress needs to do something: \"We need to act.\"\n\nWhite House legislative affairs director Eric Ueland spoke to senators on Tuesday afternoon about the prospects, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) met with Trump personally about the fall agenda. McConnell said afterward the meeting went well but did not provide any specifics.\n\nHouse Minority Whip Steve Scalise returned from the White House without any new signs that Trump is eyeing sweeping action on guns, and with little hope of compromise with Democrats. Scalise confirmed that Trump is still in talks with congressional leaders. But the No. 2 House Republican also disparaged Democrats for their efforts to move ahead with other gun control bills.\n\n\u201cThere might be other laws that we can get an agreement on. But the other concern is, do the Democrats actually want to solve problems? Or do they want to just be more aggressive in taking away people\u2019s guns?\u201d Scalise told a gaggle of reporters Tuesday night.\n\nThe group, including Attorney General William Barr, did discuss gun background checks, Scalise said, but it mostly focused on the \u201cgaps in our current laws\u201d \u2014 rhetoric that echoes the GOP\u2019s long-time resistance to expanding background checks or adding other limits on gun access.\n\nNo one could offer any prediction of where Trump might come down.\n\n\"He's open to doing something in this space. And from my conversations with him and confirmed by his staff, he has not made a decision regarding exactly what he\u2019s going to support,\" said Toomey, who estimated he's spoken to Trump a half-dozen times over the past month.\n\nDespite the hope for a bipartisan solution on guns, Senate Republican and Democratic leadership attacked each other while Trump deliberates. McConnell, whose stance on gun legislation is whatever Trump supports, accused Democrats of pulling a \u201cstunt\u201d Monday, when Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) held a press conference calling for the Senate to take up the House-passed universal background checks bill. Republicans generally oppose that bill.\n\n\u201cThey are working on coming up with a proposal that the president will sign,\u201d McConnell said referring to White House staff. \u201cUntil that happens, all of this is theatrics.\u201d\n\nSchumer was unmoved.\n\n\u201cShame on him,\u201d Schumer responded. \u201cThere are people who died. Shame on him. Put the bill on the floor and stop ducking the issue.\u201d\n\nSarah Ferris contributed to this report.\n\n", "description": "Senators involved in gun negotiations believe the Trump administration will provide a proposal soon.", "authors": ["Marianne Levine", "Burgess Everett"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/ce/73/9bc48fe949378f87eef55cc895e7/190910-pat-toomey-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
