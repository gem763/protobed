The Shanghai Composite slipped 0.4% while the Shenzhen Composite declined 0.6% ahead of the National Day holiday, which will shut Chinese markets until Oct. 8. South Korea's Kospi rose 0.5% while benchmark indexes in Singapore and Indonesia declined. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was flat.\n\nHong Kong got a boost from reassuring comments by the chief executive of its monetary authority.\n\nNorman Chan Tak-lam, who is stepping down, said that despite the past several months of political protest, \"the monetary system that means the exchange rate, the banking system and the financial system, have remained stable, and they have been continue to function normally and smoothly.\"\n\nTwo gauges of Chinese factory activity improved in September ahead of a round of trade talks with Washington.\n\nSurveys released Monday by an industry group and a business magazine both showed improvement, though the gains were small.\n\nDemand for Chinese goods has been hurt by weakening domestic and global economic growth as well as U.S. tariff hikes in a fight over trade and technology. Negotiators are due to meet next month in Washington but there has been no sign of progress toward ending the dispute.\n\nChina said Sunday that its top trade negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He, will travel to Washington on October for renewed trade negotiations with the U.S. An exact date for the talks was not announced, but a senior Chinese official said \"The two sides should find a solution through equal dialogue in accordance with the principle of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit,\" the Associated Press reported (link).\n\nOn Friday, reports emerged about possible White House plans to restrict U.S. investment in Chinese companies. U.S. Treasury officials on Saturday denied any plans to do so \"at this time,\" but also did not rule them out, leaving analysts and investors to wonder (link) if it was a negotiating tactic or a signal of a much harder line by the Trump administration.\n\nAmong individual stocks, SoftBank (9984.TO) fell in Tokyo trading, along with Toyota (7203.TO) and Screen Holdings (7735.TO) . In Hong Kong, PetroChina (601857.SH) and China Mobile (0941.HK) rose, and Budweiser APAC -- the Asian spinoff from beer-maker Anheuser-Busch InBev -- opened higher in its massive initial public offering (link).

U.S. Treasury officials on Saturday denied any plans to do so \"at this time,\" but also did not rule them out, leaving analysts and investors to wonder (link) if it was a negotiating tactic or a signal of a much harder line by the Trump administration.\n\nUncertainty over the long-running trade war has fueled volatility in the market and stoked worries that the impact of tariffs and other tactics employed by the countries against each other is hampering U.S. economic and corporate profit growth.\n\nThe possibility that the U.S. is weighing another way of applying pressure on China dampened investors' already cautious optimism that the world's two biggest economies might make progress as their representatives resume their negotiations.\n\nThe S&P 500 index fell 0.5% to 2,961.79. The benchmark index finished the week with a 1% loss. Even so, it remains 2.1% below its all-time high set in July.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.3% to 26,820.25.
