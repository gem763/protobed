Imagine how many lives we could save.\u201d\n\nAlmost as soon as the Democrats sought to question Mr Lewandowski, events lurched towards chaos. Congressman Jerry Nadler, chair of the House judiciary committee and the man who called the hearing as part of a formal process to determine whether to seek the president\u2019s impeachment, asked him if he had met alone with the president in June 2017 to discuss limiting the scope of the Mueller investigation.\n\nMr Lewandowski, who had been told by the White House only to talk about events he had already discussed with the special counsel, Robert Mueller, said he did not have a copy of the report in front of him. Mr Nadler stewed and simmered as a copy was found. He snapped that Mr Lewandowski was \u201cfilibustering\u201d.\n\n\u201cI think we should call this what it is: an absolute cover-up by the White House,\u201d said Mr Nadler. \u201cToday\u2019s cover-up is part of a pattern of the White House blocking Congress.\u201d\n\nMr Lewandowski gave as good as he got. He confirmed he had met with then attorney general Jeff Sessions to discuss putting a limit on the scale of the Trump-Russia probe, but said he did not believe the president \u201casked me to do anything illegal\u201d.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Ranking member Doug Collins, termed the hearing an \u201caudiobook of the Mueller report\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe had Mr Mueller here. Had a long day of it. Judging by all accounts, it didn\u2019t go real well,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother Republican, John Ratcliffe of Texas, said: \u201cThey are going to bring back anybody, as much as they have to, to find something, anything to keep impeachment hopes alive.\u201d\n\nIn response to one question, Mr Lewandowski, who is weighing up a Senate run in New Hampshire which Mr Trump has strongly backed, said he believed the Democrats on the committee hated Mr Trump more than they loved their country.\n\nWhite House counsel Pat Cipollone told the committee in a letter on Monday that Mr Lewandowski could not testify about conversations with Mr Trump after he became president or with his senior advisors.\n\nThe White House also directed two other witnesses, former Trump White House aides Rob Porter and Rick Dearborn, not to testify. Mr Cipollone\u2019s letter said they were \u201cabsolutely immune from compelled congressional testimony with respect to matters related to their service as senior advisers to the president\u201d.\n\nTuesday\u2019s hearing underscored the dilemma faced by the Democrats as they seek to turn the screws on Mr Trump, seemingly disappointed that Mr Mueller\u2019s report cleared the president of colluding with Russia to influence the 2016 election, and failing to call for his indictment for obstructing justice, even though the report detailed many such instances.\n\nWhile a majority of House Democrats support impeachment of the president, the speaker, Nancy Pelosi, is opposed to such a move, saying it could help energise Mr Trump\u2019s base ahead of the 2020 elections.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies", "description": "Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign manager performed a masterclass in stonewalling and obfuscation \u2013 refusing to answer any meaningful questions posed to him by the\u00a0Democrats on Capitol Hill,\u00a0who became increasingly angry and frustrated.", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/17/17/corey-stonewall.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
