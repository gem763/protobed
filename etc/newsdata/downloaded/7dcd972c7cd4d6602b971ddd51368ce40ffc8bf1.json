(John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\nWashington Redskins running back Derrius Guice was being evaluated Monday for a possible right knee injury, though it is unclear exactly how serious that ailment may be.\n\nTwo people with knowledge of the situation said the injury could keep Guice out for multiple games, though Washington Coach Jay Gruden said the MRI exam Guice had Monday was to look at \u201cknee soreness\u201d and suggested that the second-year pro might miss little, if any, time. When asked if there is a chance Guice can still play Sunday against the Dallas Cowboys, Gruden said: \u201cFor sure.\u201d\n\nGuice\u2019s potential absence would add another layer to the team\u2019s complicated running back situation, which was in the spotlight after Sunday\u2019s season-opening loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, during which Guice started and Adrian Peterson, last year\u2019s leading rusher, was held out as a healthy scratch for the first time in his career.\n\n[Svrluga: With Adrian Peterson, Redskins have two options: Play him or set him free]\n\nThe news of Guice\u2019s injury seemed to be a surprise to many in the organization, after the running back took several hits in Sunday\u2019s game and then moved around the locker room afterward as if everything were fine. Guice had gone into the sideline medical tent for a brief time during the second quarter Sunday but later said he simply needed a place to urinate. Gruden said Monday that Guice was actually being looked at by doctors when the back was inside the tent and that the doctors had cleared him to continue playing.\n\nThe injured knee is not the one doctors surgically repaired in the summer of 2018 when Guice tore his ACL in his first preseason game, causing him to miss all of last season, but the fact he is hurt again is a big concern for an organization that desperately wants him to be its featured back.\n\nGuice\u2019s injury also brings a strange twist to an already awkward situation involving his obvious replacement, Peterson. Though Peterson signed late last summer to replace Guice and several other injured running backs, he quickly became the team\u2019s top offensive player, rushing for 1,042 yards and seven touchdowns. Peterson signed a two-year contract with the Redskins this offseason and expected to split time with Guice in the backfield. But last week, Gruden named Guice the team\u2019s primary running back and didn\u2019t even dress Peterson for Sunday\u2019s loss, saying it was more important to carry an extra special teams player than Peterson, whose potential carries could be handled by Guice.\n\nAfter Sunday\u2019s game he went as far as to say he would only play Peterson if they have a game \u201cwhere we run the ball 55 times a game in the I formation.\u201d\n\nHis criticism of Peterson seemed to upset some players, who respect Peterson not only because he has won a league MVP award and run for 13,318 career yards, but for the way he quietly fit into the locker room last year despite being a superstar. Right tackle Morgan Moses called the fact Peterson didn\u2019t dress \u201ca slap in the face.\u201d\n\n\u201cAdrian is well-liked in the locker room,\u201d Gruden said Monday, striking a more laudatory tone. \u201cHe\u2019s well-liked by the coaches. He\u2019s well-liked by everybody. Like I said before, it wasn\u2019t an easy decision to make him inactive, without a doubt. However, we did need [fourth back Wendell] Smallwood to cover some punts. He did a great job on kickoff return and punt cover, and we needed the extra linebacker who actually made a couple great plays on punt. Unfortunately, like I said, we couldn\u2019t get them up at the same time. That could change next week, depending on where our third back is. It could change the week after if we want to dress four backs. Just this week in general, I thought it was best for the football team to dress three backs, the extra linebacker and one of the backs being a special teams player. \u201d\n\nWhen asked if he wants Peterson on the team, Gruden nodded.\n\n\u201cOh yeah, for sure,\u201d he said. \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t want Adrian?\u201d\n\nGruden pointed out that there are still 15 weeks left in the season, providing more opportunities for Peterson to play. He said he expects Peterson will be ready.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a great attitude about it,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cI know he\u2019s not happy about it, but when his number is called, he\u2019ll be ready to go. And his number will be called.\u201d\n\nGruden said defensive lineman Jonathan Allen, who sprained his knee in Sunday\u2019s game, is \u201cday-to-day.\u201d The head coach also said he is hopeful that tight end Jordan Reed will be cleared to play for Sunday\u2019s home opener against Dallas, more than three weeks after he suffered a concussion in the team\u2019s third preseason game. Reed will be examined later this week.\n\nBackup defensive lineman Caleb Brantley aggravated a lingering foot injury in the loss to Philadelphia. He, too, is day-to-day.\n\nRead more:\n\nInside the four drives that doomed the Redskins in their loss to the Eagles\n\nEven after a demoralizing collapse, Redskins remain upbeat about loss to Eagles\n\nMorgan Moses calls out Redskins coaches for sitting Adrian Peterson: \u2018It\u2019s a slap in the face\u2019\n\nThree takeaways from Redskins\u2019 season-opening loss to Eagles\n\nAdrian Peterson on being held out of Redskins\u2019 opener: \u2018Of course it\u2019s not a role I want\u2019", "description": "Adrian Peterson, who was a healthy scratch in the season-opening loss to Philadelphia, could step in as starter if Guice misses games.", "authors": ["Les Carpenter", "Reporter Covering Washington Redskins", "Kareem Copeland", "Reporter Covering The Washington Redskins", "September At Pm", "Les Carpenter Returned To The Washington Post In", "Writes About The Washington Redskins.", "Kareem Copeland Is The Post'S Washington Redskins Beat Writer.
