The movie premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on Saturday and is framed around Rogers\u2019s relationship with a jaded journalist who profiled him, played by Matthew Rhys. As they promote the film ahead of awards season, Hanks and his collaborators, including director Marielle Heller, have praised Rogers\u2019s optimistic outlook on life as an antidote to today\u2019s pessimistic world.\n\n\u201cCynicism has become the default position for so much of daily structure and daily intercourse,\u201d Hanks told journalists assembled for the festival, the BBC reported. \u201cWhy? Because it\u2019s easy, and there\u2019s good money to be made.\u201d\n\n\n\nActor Tom Hanks arrives for the Gala Premiere of the film \"A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood\" at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival on Sept. 7, 2019.

And part of that is conspiracy theories and what have you,\u201d Hanks continued. \u201cBut I think when Fred Rogers first saw children\u2019s programming, he saw something that was cynical, and why would you put something that is cynical in front of a 2- or 3-year-old kid? That you are not cool because you don\u2019t have this toy? That it\u2019s funny to see someone being bopped on the head?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a cynical treatment of the audience, and we have become so inured to that, that when we are met with as simple a message as, \u2018Hey you know what, it\u2019s a beautiful day in the neighborhood!\u2019 we get slapped a little bit,\u201d he said.\n\nInstead, \u201cwe are allowed, I think, to feel good,\u201d Hanks insisted. \u201cThere\u2019s a place for cynicism, but why begin with it right off the bat?\u201d\n\nWhile Rogers, who died in 2003, isn\u2019t around to appraise Hanks\u2019s thoughts himself, he seems to have endorsed the messenger long ago.\n\nHeller told the Hollywood Reporter that Rogers\u2019s wife, Joanne, said Hanks was the late television host\u2019s favorite actor.\n\nRead more:\n\nWant to know who will rule the upcoming awards season?
