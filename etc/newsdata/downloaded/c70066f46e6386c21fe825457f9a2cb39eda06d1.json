Mings insisted afterwards that the abuse did not affect his feelings and that he simply felt sorry for the racists.\n\nThe players also made a collective decision to continue the game. But it is believed that his team-mates feared that at least one of England\u2019s players was affected by the chanting and manager Southgate and the FA will make checks on the entire squad during the next 10 days.\n\nPlayers will also be supported by their clubs, but, just as they did after the racist abuse in Montenegro, Southgate and the FA will make their own checks on the squad to see whether anybody needs any additional support.", "description": "Gareth Southgate and the Football Association will make checks on the mental state of the England players who suffered racist abuse in Sofia.", "authors": ["Matt Law", "Football News Correspondent", "Paul Hayward", "Jason Burt"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/15/TELEMMGLPICT000213035360_1-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqzZL_HMzlptxm9lUXbzFObzYjBah6LQDPTb5_7v13NIg.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
