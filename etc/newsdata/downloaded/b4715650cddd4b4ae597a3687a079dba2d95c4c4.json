We may earn a commission if you buy products through our links, but our recommendations are independent of any compensation that we may receive.\n\nWith Apple AAPL, +1.18% set to reveal its newest fleet of iPhones today, the highly anticipated launch might have you longing for a technology update. But most of you won\u2019t take a bite at that apple: Younger smartphone users ages 18-64 keep their phones for about 33 months, while baby boomers hang onto their phones for three or more years, according to a Strategy Analytics survey released last month.\n\nIf you\u2019re keeping your older phone, there are ways you can make it a little more useful and spiffier. MarketWatch asked experts about the most underrated iPhone accessories on the market. Here\u2019s what they had to say:\n\nBest portable charger: Anker PowerCore 5000 Portable Charger, about $18\n\nAmazon\n\nThis ultracompact charger provides over an entire replacement charge for iPhone X, or almost two charges for an iPhone 8, so you won\u2019t have to worry about being out of commission. \u201cThe first few months of any new phone, the battery lasts a good long while, usually at least a day with heavy use. But they\u2019re only designed to work like that for about a year, which doesn\u2019t help those of us who replace our iPhones every two years. Regardless, I always carry an external battery with me in my backpack, carry-on or pocket,\u201d says Tom Samiljan, tech contributor for Men\u2019s Journal, tells MarketWatch. More than 3,300 people have rated this charger 4.4 out of 5 stars on Amazon and one customer commented, \u201cI plugged my phone into the charger and my phone was fully charged in a very short period of time.\u201d And, TechGearLab, an online review site gives it one of their top scores, calling it a \u201cbest buy\u201d for its low price, portability and short recharge time.

At the very least, you\u2019ll increase your chances of ending up on one of those \u201cShot on an iPhone\u201d billboards. Tom Samiljan, tech contributor for Men\u2019s Journal tells MarketWatch, \u201cSteadiness for videos is essential. Holding your phone steady while taking pictures in low light is never, ever a bad thing.\u201d But Chandra Steele, tech expert and senior features writer for PCMag tells MarketWatch, one potential caveat, \u201cIf you\u2019re thinking of getting one of the new iPhones, which are rumored to have a very different-looking camera setup than previous models, the lens might not be compatible.\u201d Read more about this product here.\n\nBest way to protect your eyes from blue light: Maxboost Screen Protector, about $15\n\nAmazon\n\nPrevent Blindness, the nation\u2019s leading volunteer eye health and safety organization, recommends using screen filters, which \u201cdecrease the amount of blue light given off from these devices that could reach the retina in our eyes,\u201d their site explains. The thin, stain-resistant Maxboost Screen Protector helps combat eye strain and tiredness using its blue-light filter, while simultaneously protecting an iPhone\u2019s screen from everyday scratches and scrapes. Customers love it too, rating this filter 4.3 out of 5 stars on Amazon.

The encased band offers full phone protection and features an elastic band designed to flex, twist and bend while you run, hike or walk. Wirecutter says, \u201cThe standard-size original Tribe Comrade armband feels great on the arm, doesn\u2019t pinch or bind, and stays put. It\u2019s exceedingly simple to use, phones slide into the pouch easily, and they don\u2019t move at all during runs. The Lycra-neoprene band also stayed rock-solid on our testers\u2019 arms.\u201d Read more about this product here.\n\nBest inexpensive on-the-go charging cable: AmazonBasics Double Braided Nylon Lightning to USB A Cable, about $12\n\nAt just 4 inches long, this durable, Apple MFi (Made for iPhone, iPad and iPod) certified charging cable won\u2019t get tangled, bent or frayed at the bottom of your bag. With copper wire and Kevlar for added strength, this cord can be used for iPhones, iPads or iPods. Nearly 3,000 people have given this cord 4.1 out of 5 stars on Amazon and it comes with a 2-year limited warranty.

Plus, the company has figured out how to make them add a bit of style and personalization to your phone, rather than being just another random, bland, gray or black smartphone accessory.\u201d With more than 4,200 customer reviews on Amazon, PopSockets can even be used on iPads and other brands of smartphones.
