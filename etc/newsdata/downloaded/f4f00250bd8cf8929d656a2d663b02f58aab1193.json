The tragedy happened Sept. 23, but the details of the dispatcher call, first reported by The Morning Call, were not made public until now.\n\nSnyder told Berks County dispatchers on Sept. 23 she found the children unresponsive. In the call between the emergency dispatcher and the responders, a fire captain asks: \u201cAny indication from the caller if the scene is safe or how these children ended up there?\u201d\n\nThe dispatcher responded: \u201cShe mentioned that the 8-year-old has been bullied and has made threats of doing this, but didn\u2019t want to go alone\u2026 At this time, it should just be the mother and the two children on scene.\u201d\n\nA state police spokesperson told The Daily Beast the siblings were revived in a medical helicopter on the way to Lehigh Valley Hospital but died in the intensive-care unit three days later.\n\nSnyder told The Daily Beast she is \u201cnot yet ready to make public statements.\u201d A spokesperson for the Berks County District Attorney\u2019s Office declined to comment, citing the \u201congoing investigation.\u201d\n\nPennsylvania State Police seized a number of items from the scene, according to search warrants.

Another warrant, issued Oct. 2, called for locating the family\u2019s dog, a 50-pound black husky/pit bull, that had been missing for the last week.\n\n\u201cBy determining the dog\u2019s actual weight and size utilizing a scale will assist in the criminal investigation,\u201d Pennsylvania State Police Trooper Ian Keck said in the warrant application, though it was not clear why the dog was part of the probe. \u201cAll of this is important to the criminal investigation and reconstruction of the events surrounding this incident.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Kutztown Area School District, Conner was a third-grade student at Greenwich-Lenhartsville Elementary School. Officials there declined to comment on allegations the 8-year-old was bullied prior to his death.\n\n\"Conner was a beloved member of the Greenwich Elementary School family who enjoyed his peers and teachers,\u201d Superintendent Christian Temchatin said in a statement to The Daily Beast. \u201cHe is dearly missed and is fondly remembered for the smile he brought to all who knew him.\u201d\n\nThe state Department of Human Services confirmed to The Daily Beast that \u201congoing case management services\u201d were previously provided to the Snyder family through Berks County Children and Youth Services\u2014but declined to provide details.", "description": "This story may be disturbing to some readers.", "authors": ["Pilar Melendez"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_3375,w_6000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571338442/GettyImages-1127748001_p4v1mv", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
