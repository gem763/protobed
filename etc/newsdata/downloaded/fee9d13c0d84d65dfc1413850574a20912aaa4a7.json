Boeing has begun taking steps to increase safety oversight in its industrial operations and at the board level, he added.\n\nBoeing named veteran executive Stan Deal, who had been running its two-year-old Global Services Division, to the top job at Boeing Commercial Airplanes. Deal's challenge - to get the MAX back into service globally while simultaneously handling new aircraft deliveries and boosting 737 production - is seen as one of the most formidable logistical challenges in the industry's history.\n\nBoeing said it was delaying plans to step up production on its 737 line in the Seattle area through 2019, and would not hit a record-level 57 aircraft monthly until late 2020, months later than previously planned.\n\nCiting global trade tensions, it was also reducing the 787 production rate to 12 aeroplanes per month for approximately two years beginning in late 2020.\n\nIts forthcoming 777X twin-aisle, facing engine issues at General Electric, was progressing through pre-flight testing and remains on track for first flight in early 2020, but the company was now targeting early 2021 for the first delivery.", "description": "The aviation giant has been in crisis mode for months following two MAX crashes that killed 346 people.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/23/361fd17a8ab943f7bb45b6d2a6e5a897_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
