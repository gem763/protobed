Here are our 'awards' for Thursday's three-hour bonanza.\n\nDemocratic primary voters finally got to see Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren on the same stage. But the fireworks many expected between the former vice president and the Massachusetts senator never materialized.\n\nWith the field whittled down to a still-less-than-manageable 10 candidates on one stage, ABC News billed the debate as a heavyweight clash.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAfter a lengthy but civil back-and-forth between Warren and Bernie Sanders in the Medicare for All corner, and Biden and most of the other candidates in the more-incremental corner \u2014 the debate moved on to other issues. And with the change of subject came a near-total dissipation of the long-awaited tension between Biden and Warren.\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro, desperate for a campaign-changing moment, took it to Biden \u2014 but the former vice president didn\u2019t take the bait. Warren displayed her usual command of the issues and ease with the format \u2014 and mostly went unchallenged by her competitors.\n\nThree-hour debates don\u2019t always have clear winners and losers. If anything changed Thursday night, it may prove to be the reemergence of Beto O\u2019Rourke.\n\nHere are some superlatives from the third Democratic debate (one night only!):\n\n\n\nMost Improved Debater: Beto O\u2019Rourke\n\nThe former Texas congressman is weeks into his second campaign reboot, but this one may have staying power. Already before the debate, there were signs O\u2019Rourke \u2014 who has refocused his campaign on taking on President Donald Trump and gun control \u2014 on a slight upswing. A new CNN/SSRS poll out Tuesday showed O\u2019Rourke at 5 percent among Democrats nationally \u2014 the first time he reached that threshold in a debate-qualifying poll since late May.\n\nWhile he was sheepish in the two previous debates about injecting himself into each issue, O'Rourke wouldn\u2019t let himself get lost on the stage on Thursday night.\n\nO\u2019Rourke is taking some significant long-term risks \u2014 campaigning on mandatory buybacks for assault weapons, for instance. But he\u2019s newly relevant in the race for the Democratic nomination after plummeting in the polls over the summer.\n\n\n\n\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/c1/fe/0cd26c084d62b21338a0c04e0d8b/biden-beto.png\"\n\nMost Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde: Joe Biden\n\nThe good Biden showed up for the first 30 minutes of the debate. He pointedly defended his health care plan and drew meaningful contrasts with Warren. \u201cI know the senator says she\u2019s for Bernie,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, I\u2019m for Barack.\u201d\n\nWhile he jabbed at Warren (and Sanders), he mostly shrugged off attacks from the low-polling Castro, who appeared to obfuscate on Biden\u2019s health care plan.\n\nBut as the debate wore on, Biden was uneven. He gave a rambling answer about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. He said all non-violent criminals shouldn\u2019t go to jail. He talked about record players.\n\nHis word salads and grandpa moments have, over the first two debates, been baked into voters\u2019 perceptions of Biden \u2014 and his stronger moments Thursday night might overshadow those rough patches. But as voting nears and the stakes rise, will voters take a second look at whether Biden is up to the job of taking on Trump?\n\n\n\n\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/bf/a5/ee39e398492497db7b2524311ac6/harris.png\"\n\nMost Eager to Fast-Forward to the General Election: Kamala Harris\n\nHarris went after Trump from the get-go. She directed her opening statement at the president, whom she said would undoubtedly be watching. (He wasn\u2019t, since he was addressing the House GOP retreat in Baltimore.)\n\nOn health care, she brought it back to Trump. \u201cFrankly, I think this discussion has given the American public a headache,\u201d she said, urging her fellow Democrats to focus on the \u201cend goal\u201d of ousting Trump from the White House. \u201cIf we don't get Donald Trump out of office, he's going to get rid of all of it.\u201d\n\nAsked later about how her trade policy might differ from former President Barack Obama\u2019s, Harris picked another target. \u201cWell, first of all, I have no criticism of that, more than just looking at where we are now,\u201d she said, \u201cwhich is we've got a guy in the White House who has been erratic on trade policy. He conducts trade policy by tweet, frankly born out of his fragile ego.\u201d\n\n\n\nCringiest Line (Debate Site Category): Amy Klobuchar\n\nThe debate was held at Texas Southern University, a historically black college in the state\u2019s largest city, Houston.\n\nThat\u2019s the context for the reference by Sen. Amy Klobuchar in her opening statement, calling back to the movie \u201cApollo 13,\u201d which chronicled the ill-fated lunar mission in 1970.\n\n\u201cNow, I may not be the loudest person up here, but I think we've already got that in the White House,\u201d the Minnesota senator said. \u201cHouston, we have a problem. This \u2014 we have a guy there that is literally running our country like a game show.\u201d\n\n\n\nCringiest Line (Ethnic Joke Category): Andrew Yang\n\nEntrepreneur Andrew Yang has made his mark on the debate stage touting his universal basic income proposal.\n\nOn Thursday, he segued into a different topic \u2014 health care \u2014 with an awkward one-liner.\n\n\u201cI am Asian, so I know a lot of doctors,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they tell me that they spend a lot of time on paperwork, avoiding being sued and navigating the insurance bureaucracy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/3c/04/c54344d143aca2f92f3db8181af0/kamala-wizardoz.png\"\n\nMr. Rabbit Ears: George Stephanopoulos\n\nLater in her answer on trade, Harris compared Trump to the Wizard in the Wizard of Oz. \u201cYou know, he reminds me of that guy in \u2018The Wizard of Oz,\u2019\" she said. \u201cWhen you pull back the curtain, it's a really small dude.\u201d\n\nGeorge Stephanopoulos \u2014 the former Bill Clinton spokesman-turned-morning TV star \u2014 obviously has a heightened (get it?) sensitivity about short jokes, stammering, \u201cOk. I'm not even going to take the bait, Sen. Harris.\u201d\n\nBut it was clear Harris wasn\u2019t making fun of Stephanopoulos' stature; he\u2019s reportedly 5-foot-7.\n\n\u201cIt wasn't about you!\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nMost in Need of a Throat Lozenge: Bernie Sanders\n\nThe Vermonter only has one volume: loud. It's a key part of his appeal and authenticity.\n\nBut on Thursday night, his voice was a little worse for wear, scratchier than usual. Still, it survived all the way through the three-hour debate \u2014 which Sanders ended, fittingly, by talking about his political resilience.\n\n\n\nFather of the Year: Andrew Yang\n\nYang earns his second superlative for his answer to a question about his support for charter schools \u2014 not exactly a popular position in the Democratic primary.\n\n\u201cLet me be clear,\u201d he said. \u201cI am pro-good school. I've got a kid \u2014 one of my little boys just started public school last week. And I was not there because I was running for president. So, we need to pay teachers more, because the data clearly shows that a good teacher is worth his or her weight in gold.\u201d", "description": "Here are our 'awards' for Thursday's three-hour bonanza.", "authors": ["Steven Shepard"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/25/a1/ce1dee70451ab229deac77900923/compilation.png", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
