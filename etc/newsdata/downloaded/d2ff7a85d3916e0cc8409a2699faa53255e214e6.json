New Polls Differ on Who\u2019s Leading 2020 Race", "language": "en", "text": "Just over three months before Iowans caucus for Democratic presidential candidates, four polls out this week present a muddled picture of a primary race that is unfolding in varying, and sometimes conflicting, ways nationally and in early-voting states.\n\nA pair of new national polls present starkly different results. A CNN survey released Wednesday had former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. with a commanding lead of 15 percentage points ahead of Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. But a Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday had Ms. Warren as the front-runner, seven points ahead of Mr. Biden.\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders of Vermont finished a strong third in both national polls, suggesting that his standing in the race has not been diminished by his heart attack earlier this month \u2014 and that he may have been buoyed by endorsements from Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota.\n\nTwo other polls from early-voting states show a tight race in Iowa and Mr. Biden maintaining a comfortable lead in South Carolina.", "description": "Surveys released this week show varying, and sometimes conflicting, races unfolding nationally and in early primary states.", "authors": ["Matt Stevens", "Giovanni Russonello"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/24/us/politics/24polls/24polls-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
