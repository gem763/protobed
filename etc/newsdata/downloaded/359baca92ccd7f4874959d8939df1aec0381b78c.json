What progressive Democrats don\u2019t understand about the economy", "language": "en", "text": "Here are three ideas I\u2019ve come across recently. Let\u2019s break them down.\n\n1. Should we ban billionaires?\n\nDemocratic presidential contender Bernie Sanders says we should ban billionaires. It\u2019s all part of the growing trend in the idea of wealth taxes that have become popular with some Democrats.\n\nIt sounds like an OK-ish idea if you\u2019re into progressive taxation, but it\u2019s also an impractical idea that is predicated on misunderstandings. For instance, the majority of extremely wealthy people don\u2019t actually have billions of dollars sitting in their bank accounts. They are paper billionaires who mostly own illiquid assets (like corporations or real assets).\n\nIf they actually liquidated their assets they might quickly find out that they\u2019re not worth what they think they\u2019re worth.\n\nBut it\u2019s also impractical because there\u2019s no reasonable way to value many of those assets. For instance, I might be worth millions of dollars. I have no idea what Orcam Financial Group, my company, is actually worth. But let\u2019s be crazy and assume that the IRS says my firm is worth $50 million (which would be a very inaccurate assessment, by the way).\n\nThat means I would have to come up with $500,000 to pay Bernie\u2019s wealth tax. I don\u2019t have $500,000 of liquid Orcam Financial Group stock sitting around. So how am I even supposed to pay this tax? It\u2019s ridiculous.\n\nThe idea is completely impractical. A better idea if you\u2019re into this sort of thing is to raise the capital-gains tax since that operates like a wealth tax and is predicated on people actually having liquidated the assets applied to the tax. There are practical ways to deal with this issue, and while wealth taxes are a good campaign slogan, they\u2019re impractical.\n\nAnyhow, Nick Maggiulli had a pretty good assessment of this idea, so take a peak at his post.\n\n2. Does anyone work for a billion dollars?\n\nHere\u2019s another Bernie Sanders supporter making an interesting point about the ultra-rich:\n\nThere\u2019s so much wrong here I don\u2019t even know where to start.\n\nThe reason Amazon\u2019s AMZN, +0.86% Jeff Bezos is ultra-wealthy is because he worked to make capital investments that contributed to the value of other people\u2019s lives and financial assets.\n\nA socialist utopia where no one invests and the government just hands out thousands of dollars is not a real thing.\n\nInvestment is the element of the economy that makes the entire financial system work. Without people investing and spending for future production, we\u2019d all just be borrowing more and more money to consume finite resources and inevitably inflating the value of the money away.\n\nPeople who spend for future production create value and thereby create demand for money. That demand for money helps maintain the value of money. It creates a virtuous cycle, whereby investment creates demand for money, and demand for more goods and services creates demand for more investment.\n\nIf all we had was consumption and people getting paid $5,000 to sit on their rumps, there would be no incentive for investment, and the whole system would inflate away.\n\nIf, on the other hand, you took that $5,000 and invested it in something innovative, you\u2019d have the opportunity not only to earn that hypothetical $5,000, but your savings would grow thanks to future investment and compounding.\n\nFor instance, at just 2% per year, your investment of just one $5,000 investment grows to $170 million over 527 years. Of course, you need investment to generate the real return and, without it, your $5,000 just withers away.\n\nSo, no, this socialist utopia where no one invests and the government just hands out thousands of dollars is not a real thing. It\u2019s a fiction based on misunderstandings of how the value of money is created.\n\nNow, there are perfectly good arguments for higher taxes on the ultra-wealthy. But this idea that they didn\u2019t earn it or didn\u2019t work for it is just wrong on its face. The whole reason they\u2019re worth billions of dollars is because they worked to make capital investments that other people then placed a market value on.\n\nAnd then their capital investment compounded its face off. It\u2019s not just earned and worked for, it\u2019s entirely validated by the way other people vote on the value of the financial assets they created from nothing.\n\n3. Biblically responsible investing. WHAT. IN. THE. HOLY. HELL? I got this email this morning:\n\nAnd last week there was a new SEC filing for a biblically themed ETF that would cost 1.9% for any investment under $1 million (thanks to Jeff Ptak).\n\nWhat is this trash? Look, I was raised a good Catholic boy. I went to Jesuit schools. But those Jesuits also stressed the importance of understanding science and being able to decipher the Bible as a library of guiding narratives and not necessarily a book that was to be read literally.\n\nSo I get very concerned when I see high-fee funds that sell a deeply emotional narrative that takes advantage of people trying to do good because the empirical evidence clearly shows that paying high fees and doing good does not necessarily lead to a better return on investment.\n\nIn fact, we know pretty definitively that higher fees are the dominant determinant of lower performance, and the higher those fees are, the more likely you are to perform worse. And 2% is an egregious fee structure for any investment product, let alone one that claims to be able to predict which firms will perform well based on the subjective idea of how \u201cgood\u201d they are.\u00b2\n\nAnyhow, I\u2019ll step off this soapbox now. But, please, don\u2019t buy into this nonsense. Investing is mostly about controlling your emotions, and any strategy predicated on capturing high-fee assets because it sells an emotional narrative is likely to perform worse.\n\n\u00b2 \u2013 I\u2019m not sure what Jesus would think about this, but my guess is that he\u2019d want his biblically themed ETF to be free. Just guessing, though.\n\nCullen Roche is the author of the Pragmatic Capitalism blog, where this column first appeared.
