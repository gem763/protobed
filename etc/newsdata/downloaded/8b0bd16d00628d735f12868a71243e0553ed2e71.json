Some people lost everything they had,\u201d said Cooper\u2019s Town resident Kevin Pritchard, 44.\n\nFormal disaster response efforts by the Bahamian government and US-based rescue took days to begin, as teams waited for government permission to bring in doctors and equipment, gas, chainsaws and generators.\n\nSep 7, 2019; Treasure Cay, Bahamas; People unload humanitarian aid at the Treasure Cay Airport on Treasure Cay in the Bahamas following the passage of Hurricane Dorian. More\n\nThe hurricane destroyed the island\u2019s power grid and halted cell phone service for all but a few people near a battered government building in Marsh Harbour, complicating relief efforts, which were largely being conducted via satellite phone.\n\n\u201cWe need generators, we need fuel. We\u2019re going to be without power for a long time,\u201d said Darnika Farrington, 32, as a military vehicle driven by British commandos rumbled past.\n\nThe hurricane destroyed Farrington\u2019s house, and she found a bed at her grandmother\u2019s undamaged home.\n\nAt Treasure Key Airport, hundreds of survivors awaited evacuation by plane, most sitting in the sun without shelter or toilets. Some had waited for days for a flight to Nassau; many island residents are Haitians who lack documentation to travel to the United States and were reluctant to leave the Bahamas for fear they could not return.\n\nSaturday afternoon the airport was buzzing with helicopters and small planes as American pilots flew in supplies. Gary Freiberger flew over from Fort Lauderdale to help the island he\u2019s been visiting since 1980.\n\nHurricane Dorian has wreaked havoc: Here's how you can help\n\nHurricane Dorian: Relief efforts have exploded since Labor Day weekend\n\nHe looked around at the destroyed terminal building and flipped-over baggage carts and said he felt compelled to help people he\u2019s known for decades.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my time to give back,\u201d he said.\n\nIn wealthier areas of the island, the storm tore off roofs, leaving air conditioners dangling, and ripped open garages. Boats were jammed onto docks or front lawns, and cars buried beneath downed palm trees. Poorer areas were simply leveled, the simple houses flattened by the wind, leaving behind rubble and kitchen stoves.\n\nSep 7, 2019; Treasure Cay, Bahamas; People unload humanitarian aid at the Treasure Cay Airport on Treasure Cay in the Bahamas following the passage of Hurricane Dorian. More\n\nSaturday, members of the U.S-based EMPACT Northwest nonprofit urban search-and-rescue team began checking buildings in the Treasure Cay marina area, carefully walking across nail-studded boards of homes turned inside out by the wind.\n\nThey were joined by Team Rubicon and Hearts & Hands Disaster Recovery, assisted by companies like Tropic Ocean Airways, which was using float planes to reach more remote areas. Chef Jose Andres and his team from World Central Kitchen were flying in hot meals for survivors and rescue workers alike, and the number of doctors ready to treat patients was growing.", "description": "Food, water and other humanitarian aid began pouring onto Abaco Island on Saturday as private pilots and charter companies ferried in supplies and carried out hurricane survivors.", "authors": ["Trevor Hughes", "Grace Hauck", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0TGiQHYRvhhKu.9AV_akxA--~B/aD0zMjg3O3c9NDM0NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/044a80b7e7fe06c2bf3c01498148fb6a", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
