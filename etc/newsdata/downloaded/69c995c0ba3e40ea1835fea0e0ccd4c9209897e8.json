In an email to the staff, the NBC News chairman Andrew Lack said the network \u201chad nothing yet fit to broadcast.\u201d He added, \u201cWe spent eight months pursuing the story, but at the end of that time, NBC News \u2014 like many others before us \u2014 still did not have a single victim or witness willing to go on the record.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cCatch and Kill,\u201d Mr. Farrow has set his sights on Mr. Lack and the NBC News president Noah Oppenheim. The book includes a detailed account of the pushback Mr. Farrow said he had received from the news division\u2019s executives, and his reporting on Mr. Lauer could have reverberations at the network. Up until now, Mr. Farrow had been publicly silent on his disagreements with the network.\n\nAt the time of Mr. Lauer\u2019s firing, NBC News executives said they had not been aware of the host\u2019s sexual misconduct until the first accuser filed a complaint. In a memo to the staff on Nov. 29, 2017, Mr. Lack wrote: \u201cWhile it is the first complaint about his behavior in the over 20 years he\u2019s been at NBC News, we were also presented with reason to believe this may not have been an isolated incident.\u201d\n\nThe network started an inquiry. Unlike previous investigations of sexual misconduct involving employees at media companies like NPR and Fox News, which relied on the work of outside law firms, NBC used its own counsel to look into the question of whether or not its executives were aware of Mr. Lauer\u2019s behavior before any complaint was lodged against him.\n\nFive months after the firing, the NBCUniversal legal team filed a report clearing NBC News management.\n\n\u201cWe found no evidence indicating that any NBC News or \u2018Today\u2019 show leadership, News H.R. or others in positions of authority in the News Division received any complaints about Lauer\u2019s workplace behavior prior to Nov. 27, 2017,\u201d the report concluded.", "description": "The reporter who helped bring down Harvey Weinstein secured an on-the-record interview with one of the former \u201cToday\u201d host\u2019s accusers.", "authors": ["Jim Windolf", "John Koblin", "Rachel Abrams"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/09/business/09FARROWBOOK-02/09FARROWBOOK-02-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
