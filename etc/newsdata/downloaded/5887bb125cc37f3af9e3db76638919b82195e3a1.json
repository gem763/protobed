This is due to a combination of the poor behaviour by such establishments as the banks, and a rising distrust of earned expertise fuelled by social media giving equal weight to conspiracy theorists and people such as climate-change deniers. With Morrison, his public perception as the nation\u2019s most powerful figure was every bit as unambiguous as the views of the panel.\n\n\u201cWe threw all different names around,\u2019\u2019 Scales said of his focus groups. \u201cAnd up front we just said to people, without giving them any prompting, \u2018who are the most powerful people in Australia?\u2019 And it was Scott Morrison and no-one else. They could hardly think of another name. There was no discussion after that. For the list of Australia\u2019s most powerful people, I would nominate Morrison one, two and three. He would give Winx a run for its money.\u2019\u2019\n\nMorrison is on the rise. His authority within his own party is akin to that of John Howard when he was PM, and a newly-elected Kevin Rudd, before his colleagues turned on him.\n\nThe Prime Minister shows no signs, at this stage at least, of throwing away what he has earned. His modus operandi is one of consolidation. For the same reasons, those close to Morrison bask in his power. Phil Gaetjens has moved up the ladder as quickly as Morrison, going from the Treasurer\u2019s chief of staff to Treasury Secretary to Secretary of the Department of Prime Minster and Cabinet \u2013 all in less than four years.\n\nGaetjens was destined for the scrap heap had Labor won. Now he is one of, if not the most trusted and relied-upon people in Morrison\u2019s inner circle and is charged with implementing a major cultural overhaul of the public sector, focused on service delivery and implementing the government\u2019s agenda. For the second successive year, he leads the covert list and, like his boss, under markedly different circumstances.\n\nFurther reflecting Morrison\u2019s power is the fact that three other members of his circle make the covert list \u2013 chief of staff John Kunkel, principal private secretary Yaron Finkelstein and Liberal Party federal secretary Andrew Hirst.\n\nBusiness is powerful because of its employer status and large number of stakeholders. I don\u2019t think we should underestimate that. \u2014 Nicola Wakefield Evans\n\nJoining them is Mathias Cormann, who has been shifted from the covert list to the overt list. Cormann lost a lot of paint last year when he backed Peter Dutton in the leadership spill. It was not just the treachery of which he was subsequently accused, but the fact he and his fellow plotters bungled the numbers. Cormann was lampooned as the Finance Minister who couldn\u2019t count. But he remains a powerful figure internally. He is the Coalition\u2019s Senate leader, is pivotal in budget management, and his negotiating skills came to the fore in July when he secured the passage of $158 billion in income tax cuts. Cormann, according to those who know him, is working hard to redeem himself internally but his downgraded public perception sees him shift to the dark side of power. For now, at least, he\u2019s in the sin-bin of sorts.\n\nSo why did Dutton survive, given he was bungler in chief? Pretty much for the same reasons Tony Abbott made the list last year. Negative power. Dutton wields power, internally and externally. He recently reconvened a weekly gathering of conservative Liberals known as the Monkey Pod, named after the room in Parliament where the conservatives have met frequently in previous years and where the plot against Turnbull fomented.\n\nIn addition, Dutton captures attention. When he speaks, people either love to listen to him or hate to listen to him. He gets attention regardless, said Scales. Also, his Home Affairs portfolio is of core interest to Morrison\u2019s \u201cquiet Australians\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe signature challenge to Morrison\u2019s power is coming from the business community. Everyone in business accepts, without question, Morrison\u2019s power. But there has also arisen a significant and growing disconnect between the government and business caused by a frustration over the lack of a settled energy policy, a lack of commitment towards climate change, social reform and reform in general. Panellist and veteran company director Nicola Wakefield Evans said politics and business should not be conflated.\n\n\u201cBusiness is powerful because of its employer status and large number of stakeholders. I don\u2019t think we should underestimate that,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cBusinesses have gone out on a limb on a number of issues where governments have failed to fire. And we\u2019re going to see that in relation to climate change and the proposal for an Indigenous voice in the constitution.\u201d The tenor of the discussion is the government believes business has abandoned it while business regards the government as \u201cirrelevant\u2019\u2019.\n\nTreasurer and deputy Liberal leader Josh Frydenberg has leapfrogged his colleagues in the power stakes. Alex Ellinghausen\n\nThe only senior member of the government regarded as a friend of big business is Treasurer and deputy Liberal leader Josh Frydenberg. He is seen as a conduit. Otherwise, as panellist and former Liberal Party federal director Brian Loughnane said, \u201cthere\u2019s parallel universes being developed\u2019\u2019. Business is creating its own leaders and this explains the elevation to the overt list of Atlassian co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes. His success and entrepreneurial background gives him independence and authority, and he is in enormous demand from ASX listed boards as a source of advice, especially on climate, resources, start-ups and technology. \u201cHe is very direct on what he wants to achieve. And even if they criticise him behind his back, they listen and they do it,\u201d said panellist, former union leader and now KPMG partner Paul Howes.\n\nWhile Morrison stays at number one, the list as a whole reflects just how the power balance has shifted in Australia in just 12 months, due primarily to an election result that caught the business community, the political establishment and much of society off guard. Consider those who have gone missing. Just three who made the list last year are on it again and one of those, Dutton, is questionable. The others are Morrison and Frydenberg who, like Morrison, has leapfrogged colleagues in the power stakes.\n\nFrydenberg used a combination of hard work, loyalty, likeability and political savvy. Not only did he land on his feet after the tumult of August 2018, but as of now, he\u2019s the most obvious heir apparent. Gone, though, is Bill Shorten who was number two last year, not only because he was Opposition leader, but because the growing expectation that he would become prime minister gave authority to each of his utterances. Now, Shorten languishes on the frontbench as shadow minister for the NDIS. He sits near the man who was supposed to have been his treasurer, Chris Bowen, now shadow minister for health and also gone from the list.\n\nThe only Labor figure on the list is Anthony Albanese and he is there for the same reason Morrison was there last year \u2013 by virtue of the position he holds and nothing else. There was a great deal of conjecture as to whether he should be there at all, so rudderless has the Opposition been since its May 18 defeat. \u201cAnthony is a phenomenal politician. Yet at the moment he holds very little power over his own party, let alone in society,\u2019\u2019 says Howes. \u201cI think, the fact that he\u2019s got John Setka, the true definition of a knuckle dragger, being able to hold him to ransom within his own party is evident of that.\u201d\n\nLabor leader Anthony Albanese leaves his Parliament House office to attend Question Time. Dominic Lorrimer\n\nAlbanese is on Power list probation. Some think his time has passed. \u201cThey voted for the wrong person last time,\u2019\u2019 panellist Amanda Vanstone said of the Labor Party choosing Shorten after the 2013 defeat. \u201cIt\u2019s all very well for Coalition people not to like the Labor leader. But when a lot of the Labor people don\u2019t like them either or trust them...\u2019\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnlike Albanese, ACTU secretary Sally McManus, who was 6th on the overt list in 2018, has been dumped. She would have been near the top had Shorten won. Now, not only does the ACTU have no input into government decision-making, it is under attack. Furthermore, McManus\u2019s lack of authority was laid bare when Setka defied her calls for him to quit the union.\n\nAlso gone is Tony Abbott who made the cut last year, in 9th spot, due primarily to his ability to rally the conservative wing of Australian politics and his destructive powers. He last used those with lethal force to see off Turnbull before being seen off himself by the voters.\n\nSusan Kiefel\u2019s time in the sun has passed given the section 44 scandals have gone for now, while Kenneth Hayne\u2019s work in cleaning up the banks is done, although he is keeping a weather eye on the implementation of his recommendations. They are replaced by the ACCC\u2019s Rod Sims, the regulator business fears the most, and Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe, who has become more activist in pushing the government to combat the effects of a slowing global economy, as his own power to effect change through monetary policy is all-but exhausted.\n\nFor the first time in several years, a state leader makes the cut. There was a debate as to whether it should be Gladys Berejiklian or Daniel Andrews. Andrews is certainly more settled and Morrison has chosen the Victorian leader\u2019s late 2018 election victory \u2013 which was based on infrastructure delivery \u2013 as the template for his own re-election in three years. Additionally, Andrews has become Morrison\u2019s fulcrum for federal-state relations, which has marginalised federal Labor.\n\nAt the same time, Berejiklian, like Morrison, came from behind to win in March, delivering the NSW Liberal Party its first third-term victory since Bob Askin. Yet, underscoring how fragile power can be, she has spent much of her second term as Premier fending off calls to resign over an abortion bill she foolishly allowed to be rushed. Calls for her head were being led by a conservative rump in her ranks with the support of the Murdoch media which again earns a spot on the covert list because of its established role as a political player.\n\nSome things never change.\n\nThe AFR Magazine annual Power issue is out Friday, October 4, inside The Australian Financial Review.
