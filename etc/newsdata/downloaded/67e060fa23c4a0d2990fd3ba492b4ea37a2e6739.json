We will have the resources to go the full distance, and to win, the 2020 nominating contests.\u201d\n\nMr. Buttigieg has had more staying power than some expected early on in the race.\n\nThe 37-year-old, who is openly gay, has consistently polled in the second-tier of candidates, trailing former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, and Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernard Sanders of Vermont.\n\nThe Buttigieg camp raised $24 million during the previous quarter.\n\nIn this fundraising quarter, which ran from July 1 to Sept. 30, the Buttigieg camp said 182,000 new people donated to the campaign. The average donation this quarter was $32.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
