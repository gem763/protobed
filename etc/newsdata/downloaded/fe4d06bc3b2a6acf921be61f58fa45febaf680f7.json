They also self-reported whether or not they'd had same-sex partners in their lifetime.\n\nThe teens were asked if they ever were 'so sad or hopeless almost every day for [two] weeks or more in a row that you stopped doing some usual activities?'\n\nResearchers found that rates of depression among heterosexual teens fell from 29.3 percent in 1999 to 23.7 percent in 2017.\n\nBut among 'sexual minority' teens, rates increased slight from 51.4 percent to 51.9 percent over the same time period.\n\nThe team also looked at depression rates among those who reported ever having been in a relationship.\n\nAmong heterosexual teens, rates fell from 35.5 percent to 29.5 percent and - among LGBTQ teens - rates increased from 48.7 percent to 53.8 percent.\n\nThere have been several efforts and organizations set up to help drive down these rates such as the Association of Gay and Lesbian Psychiatrists and the Trevor Project, a support network for LGBTQ youth in crisis.\n\n'These findings lend urgency to the need for studies evaluating effectiveness of existing treatments for adolescent depression in this population,' the authors wrote.\n\n'Addressing mental health disparities remains a priority in research and clinical practice, and there is much opportunity for progress in addressing this public health concern.'", "description": "A new study from Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University in Rhode Island found that gay, lesbian and bisexual teens' rates of depression rose slightly from 51.4% in 1999 to 51.9% in 2017.", "authors": ["Mary Kekatos Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/16/19997532-0-image-a-23_1571672133036.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
