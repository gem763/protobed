Arnault stated that the newly-named award \u201cnaturally perpetuates the closeness we developed over the years and is a tribute to the man\u2019s unique creative genius, to his ability to turn Paris into the fashion capital of the world\u201d.\n\nThe recipient of the prize, who must be under the age of 40 and produced/sold at least two women\u2019s or men\u2019s ready-to-wear collections, is to receive \u20ac150,000 and a one-year mentorship programme provided by an LVMH team.\n\nThis year\u2019s prize has already received more than 1,700 applicants from over 100 countries.\n\nThe awards\u2019 jury includes an array of famous LVMH alumni including Dior\u2019s Maria Grazia Chiuri, Marc Jacobs, Louis Vuitton\u2019s Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re, Loewe\u2019s Jonathan Anderson, and Givenchy\u2019s Clare Waight Keller, as well as the company\u2019s executives Delphine Arnault, Jean-Paul Claverie and Sidney Toledano.\n\nIn February, Silvia Venturini Fendi \u2013 creative director for accessories, menswear, and children at Fendi \u2013 cried as she took an emotional bow at the end of the Italian brand\u2019s autumn/winter 2019 show following the death of Lagerfeld.\n\nAs she left the catwalk, a screen played a video of Lagerfeld sketching the outfit he wore on his first day working at Fendi in 1965.\n\nEach attendee at the show was greeted with a card on their seat featuring the date the designer passed away alongside his signature.\n\nThe show notes for the collection also noted a number of references to Lagerfeld including pointed shirt collars and the use of his curling \u201cKarligraphy\u201d FF logo that appeared on cabochon buttons and intarsia fur.\n\nChanel paid homage to the German designer by beginning its highly-anticipated Paris Fashion Week show in March with a minute\u2019s silence.\n\nModels stood shoulder-to-shoulder at the top of the runway while the touching tribute took place. Cara Delevingne, a long-time muse of Lagerfeld\u2019s, later led the finale of models to the sounds of David Bowie\u2019s \u201cHeroes\u201d.", "description": "LVMH has announced it is launching a fashion prize in honour of Karl Lagerfeld.", "authors": ["Katie O'Malley"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/28/09/gettyimages-464157597.jpg"}
