Steve Bullock\u2019s presidential campaign. Bullock has failed to make the stage for recent debates, including Tuesday\u2019s in Ohio.\n\nMiller and Bauer have endorsed Bullock.\n\nFormer Iowa Democratic Party Chair and former U.S. Rep. Dave Nagle said the DNC is shutting out those without access to wealth or name recognition.\n\n___\n\n12:05 a.m.\n\nDemocrats are confronting a rapidly shifting political landscape as a dozen candidates meet on Tuesday for the most crowded presidential debate in modern history.\n\nThe House impeachment inquiry that has put President Donald Trump on the offensive has also reordered the political calculus for Democrats, especially Joe Biden. The former vice president is facing baseless \u2014 but persistent \u2014 allegations of wrongdoing overseas from Trump and his allies.\n\nHis early front-runner status is also under threat from Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. But as she rises, Warren is also fending off new questions about her biography.\n\nAdding to the drama, Bernie Sanders is recovering from a heart attack that raised questions about his ability to withstand a campaign and about who might win his support if he had to drop out.", "description": "WESTERVILLE, Ohio (AP) \u2014 The Latest on the Democratic presidential race (all times local): 4:50 p.m. A trio of Iowa officials is criticizing the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/15/86a297_election-2020-debate-66495-stage-is-prepared-cnn-new-york-times-host-democratic-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
