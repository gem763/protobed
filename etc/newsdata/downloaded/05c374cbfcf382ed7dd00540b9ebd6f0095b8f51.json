The intelligence community inspector general, Michael Atkinson, reviewed the complaint and determined that it was credible.\n\nGiuliani is mentioned 31 times in the complaint and is described as a \"central figure\" in Trump's efforts. The whistleblower said Attorney General William Barr \"appears to be involved as well.\"\n\nSchiff's office noted in a letter accompanying Monday's subpoena that Giuliani admitted on national television that \"while serving as the President's personal attorney, he asked the government of Ukraine to target former Vice President Joe Biden.\"\n\n\"In addition to this stark admission, you stated more recently that you are in possession of evidence \u2014 in the form of text messages, phone records, and other communications \u2014 indicating that you were not acting alone and that other Trump Administration officials may have been involved in this scheme,\" the letter said.\n\nThe lawmakers said Giuliani must provide the documents they requested by October 15.", "description": "The subpoena is part of the House's wide-ranging impeachment inquiry into Trump that was launched last week.", "authors": ["Sonam Sheth"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5c4816542bdd7f4d5825d6c2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
