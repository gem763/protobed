Kennedy International Airport. As a consultant, Hollister travels often for work and says he racks up some $3,700 a month in Uber fares just for airport trips alone. Which is why, on one cool and bright October Friday, Hollister flew to JFK in a Blade helicopter.\n\nBlade has been called a \u201cflying taxi startup,\u201d but in reality, its approach is much more simple than the perpetually vapourware flying cars: using your smartphone or their website, for about $300, anyone can fly from their Manhattan helipads to JFK (or vice versa) in about six minutes.\n\nConsidering a cab to JFK from Manhattan is a flat $100 fare, will likely take about an hour or so if you\u2019re lucky, and public transportation options can take even longer while being a pain with luggage, the appeal to a certain type of person who values their time at $300 an hour is obvious. In Manhattan, there are many, many people who can treat that the same way the rest of us might treat a $40 Uber ride home from a bar.\n\nAnd the view, as I found out while sitting to Hollister\u2019s right, is better than the one from the Van Wyck. (Full Disclosure: Blade comped my round-trip ride for this story, to demonstrate how its service works, as it\u2019s done with other media outlets lately. I walked back to the office afterward.)\n\nPhoto: Aaron Gordon\n\nHollister, seated with his legs crossed while taking cell phone photos out the window (I mean, I was too, as demonstrated above), said he has used Blade before to get to the Hamptons, as one does. But he\u2019s never used it for an airport run until today to catch his flight to Los Angeles.\n\nAs we circled lower Manhattan\u2019s skyscrapers, skirted downtown Brooklyn, traversed Prospect Park, sauntered over the gridlock on the Belt Parkway, and touched down on the helipad tarmac at JFK right on time, Hollister suspected his Uber expenditures might go down in the future. Good news for Blade; asked if he would be taking a helicopter to the airport from now on, he replied, \u201cOh, 100 per cent.\u201d\n\nThe app-based helicopter service is not just Blade\u2019s domain, and it\u2019s hardly limited to New York. There are currently three companies offering app-based helicopter rides: Uber Copter offering those Manhattan-to-JFK airport rides from a different helipad; Blade with flights in the Northeast, Los Angeles and San Francisco; and most recently Voom, an affiliate of the aircraft manufacturer Airbus with helipads in S\u00e3o Paulo, Mexico City and now San Francisco.\n\nOne thing these cities all have in common: infuriating traffic and lots of well-off people willing to pay to avoid it.\n\nAs for the ride, it\u2019s faultless, at least from a passenger perspective. It is fast. It is time-efficient. On days like these, it is gorgeous. But I didn\u2019t spend the ride thinking about the view. All I could think about was how much fuel we were burning, about how we have replaced one inefficient form of transportation with another, even less efficient form. And that posed a set of problems because no matter how I wrapped my head around it, I couldn\u2019t find a clear case to make when only grading it on emissions, which, for me, has become a key consideration in how I decide to get around.\n\nWhile concerns about safety and noise have already gotten plenty of attention, as well as a larger existential question about what kind of a society we have when the richest of us can simply buy their way out of any and all inconveniences, the one issue that seems to be going largely unaddressed are the environmental concerns of more helicopter trips at a time when we, as a society, need to be drastically reducing emissions from transportation, not increasing them.\n\nEveryone has a role to play in reducing their carbon footprint, but the wealthiest have a disproportionate responsibility because wealth is one of the strongest predictors of emissions. Almost as a rule, rich people have a larger carbon footprint than poor people, and rich countries have a larger carbon footprint than poor countries. Therefore, it is the richest of us who must make the biggest change in order to reduce global emissions.\n\nHow this could work while making \u201curban air mobility\u201d accessible to even more people remains to be seen.\n\nThe plan to reduce emissions from how people get around (at least from current presidential candidates, industry execs, and their regulators) has been, in a nutshell, to electrify everything while transitioning the grid to renewable energy. Unfortunately, more helicopters, while a tiny fraction of our overall transportation emissions picture, are a step in the wrong direction because helicopters are very fuel-inefficient.\n\nHelicopters are a lot like cars in that different models use different amounts of fuel, but even the most efficient helicopter still compares poorly to a gas-guzzling SUV.\n\nWill Heyburn, head of corporate development and business processes for Blade, told me that they think about efficiency and fuel economy as a core part of their business. As such, they contract with helicopter providers that use the Bell 407, which burns 163l per hour of flight time, which is about as good as you\u2019re going to get from a helicopter. That comes out to about three gallons of fuel per airport run, Heyburn said.\n\nOur whirly bird for the day. (Photo: Aaron Gordon)\n\nOthers fare much worse. Uber Copter is Uber\u2019s foray into the Manhattan-to-JFK airport business in an attempt to keep people like Hollister in their ecosystem. But they use the Bell 430 which, although more spacious than the Bell 407, burns fuel at 330 litres per hour, or more than double the rate of the 407.\n\nVoom did not disclose what model helicopters they use, but CityLab reporter Laura Bliss tweeted that her Voom pilot said their 15-minute trip burned 38L of fuel, indicating they either use a Bell 407 or something similar.\n\nVoom pilot told me that our 30 mile, 15 minute helicopter trip burned 10 gallons of fuel. An entire tank of gas for a small car is 12. So, generating learnings, and lots and lots of greenhouse gas! https://t.co/ambfJoKtUs \u2014 Laura Bliss (@mslaurabliss) October 4, 2019\n\nIf it was as simple as all these people taking Ubers or taxis to the airport now using helicopters, then indeed we would have a big environmental problem on our hands. But, as with most things environmental, it\u2019s not that simple.\n\nAs far as chopper services go, Heyburn says Blade runs a lean operation, at least for the airport trips. Chartered helicopters chill on helipads in New Jersey or upstate New York waiting for their next gig, fly the dozens of miles to the city, make their run, then return to base.\n\nNone of these \u201curban air mobility\u201d upstarts own and operate their own helicopters. They hire existing charters; the one I flew in is operated by Helicopter Express LLC out of New Jersey. But Heyburn is adamant that their operation is much more efficient, because the chopper simply shuttles back and forth between the airport and Manhattan all day, alleviating the deadhead miles back to base other charter services still require \u2014 no runs to Jersey or upstate here.\n\nPlus, most charters tend to serve a single individual, whereas Blade, Uber Copter and Voom all tout the fact that they pool rides. Turns out, rich people are more willing to share helicopter rides than they are cabs or Ubers.\n\nNone of the companies would disclose how many passengers on average are in the helicopters for each trip. But Heyburn said that their business model is \u201ceconomically sustainable\u201d with an average of 2.5 passengers per airport trip and that their business is \u201cprofitable in core markets\u201d such as New York. (Blade was the only of the three companies willing to be interviewed by Gizmodo; after I reached out to them about the environmental impact of their business, Heyburn invited me on an upcoming flight in addition to answering questions. Voom and Uber both declined to make anyone from the company available for an interview.)\n\nIn that vein, Heyburn contended that if all five passengers in a full Blade helicopter took their own Uber Black SUVs to the airport instead, the total emissions would be pretty close to the helicopter trip. This may well be true, said Costa Samaras, a professor in civil and environmental engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, but there haven\u2019t been any studies comparing urban helicopter emissions with other alternatives. Further, he cautioned against taking the multi-SUV trip comparison as a definitive counterexample.\n\n\u201cPetroleum-powered, rotary-winged flight is very energy-intensive,\u201d Samaras said. \u201cSo, like, if all of them can ride individually in a Suburban and they\u2019re all leaving at the same time, then maybe they can ride in one Suburban?\u201d\n\nSamaras added that he was aware of the social hurdle of getting some people to share rides \u2014 as Uber and Lyft\u2019s own struggles with their pooled rides demonstrate \u2014 but said, from an environmental perspective, \u201call that is going in the wrong direction. And so whether or not [helicopter flights are] the same as 12 Suburbans or six Suburbans or 80 Suburbans, the sign is wrong.\u201d\n\nAll agree that, to some degree, these helicopter flights are merely precursors to electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles, otherwise known as eVTOLs. The goal, they say, is to gain a foothold in the market using petroleum-fuelled helicopters, understand the business better, then shift and scale using eVTOLs.\n\nNot only are eVTOLs electric-powered, but they\u2019re far more efficient than their petroleum counterparts. Sometimes referred to as \u201cflying cars\u201d \u2014 for, as far as I can tell, no reason other than people want something to be called flying cars by now, dammit \u2014 they are fixed-wing aircraft that use smaller rotors to achieve liftoff.\n\nLike aeroplanes, the fixed-wing design means the most intense energy usage occurs at takeoff.\n\neVTOL startup Kitty Hawk\u2019s newest vehicle, Heaviside. (Screenshot: Youtube)\n\neVTOLs would be relatively efficient during cruising, so from an energy usage perspective, the longer the flight, the more efficient it would be compared to ground alternatives. A recent study in Nature by Ford and the University of Michigan researchers found that eVTOLs would for a 100-kilometre journey reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 35 per cent versus gas-powered cars. But, emissions would be 28 per cent higher than an electric car over that distance. Should an eVTOL have three people inside, it could potentially reduce emissions by a small margin even versus electric cars.\n\nFor these reasons, there are some differences in how these companies envision that transition occurring. Heyburn, for example, sees a gradual shift over the course of perhaps a decade from helicopters to eVTOLs as the technology matures.\n\nIn the meantime, he thinks Blade will still need choppers on standby, because, at JFK, the tower sometimes forces the helicopter to hover a few dozen feet over the helipad for a few minutes before the airspace clears. Even a small delay like this could drain an eVTOL\u2019s battery enough to mean it cannot complete the \u201cmission,\u201d to use the industry term.\n\nNot everyone thinks it will take so long. Uber Copter, for example, plans to start offering eVTOL commercial flights by 2023, and Voom likewise emphasised that their parent company, Airbus, is actively working on two eVTOL prototypes.\n\nWhile prototypes exist, the industry\u2019s recent experience with predictions for when autonomous cars would come to market suggests perhaps a note of caution is in order when projecting the viability of advanced transportation technology.\n\nIronically, Sebastian Thrun, the guy who literally founded Google\u2019s self-driving dream and is now CEO of flying car startup Kitty Hawk, now believes we\u2019ll get self-flying cars before self-driving cars.\n\nHeyburn is bearish on the self-driving eVTOL future, believing even when they are ready for prime time, there will still be a trained and certified human pilot.\n\nIn that vein, he likened his company\u2019s strategy to Netflix, which began as a DVD-shipping company and turned into a streaming service. Similarly, Heyburn believes, Blade will gain a foothold in the market selling one product while pivoting to another.\n\nGiven the analogy, it\u2019s worth noting Netflix still ships DVDs and Blu Rays, although lots of people forget that. In fact, it\u2019s a pretty solid business; in the second quarter of 2019, the company\u2019s DVD arm made about $68 million in profit.\n\nWhile the whole eVTOL thing gets figures out, both Voom and Blade purchase carbon offsets for all of their emissions. Uber does not, because, as an Uber spokesman explained, \u201cUber Copter is meant to be short term, generating operational and technology learnings for Uber Air which will offer pooled rides on all-electric, zero-emission eVTOLs.\u201d\n\nSamaras said purchasing offsets is \u201cbetter than doing nothing\u201d but that he longs for the day when purchasing carbon offsets is standard for any company rather than perceived as a bonus. He added that it\u2019s \u201cmore like corporate goodwill\u201d but \u201cthat doesn\u2019t solve the problem.\u201d\n\nThe frustrating aspect of transportation energy policy is, in debating ways to lower transportation emissions, one gets sucked into a cascading series of hypotheticals. What if people got around this way instead of that way? What if you put one more person in the vehicle? What if one fewer trip was taken? What if one more trip was taken? There\u2019s always a permutation to make things better, and always a scenario where it gets worse.\n\nAs we sat on the tarmac waiting to take off from JFK, I spotted four private jets parked about a hundred feet away. Flying in a private jet with relatively few people is one of the worst modes of transport for carbon emissions. Blade and Voom both offer private jet charters as well.\n\nAs we made our way back to Manhattan, an Emirates\u2019s A380 took off just to our left. An A380 produces 101 grams of CO2 emissions per passenger per kilometre if 80 per cent full. In other words, if that flight was going to Emirates\u2019 hub in Dubai, each passenger on that plane accounts for, on average, 1.1 metric tons of CO2 that plane will emit. In 2014, the last year for which data is available, the average person emitted 4.98 metric tons of CO2.\n\nIn the end, figuring out the greenest way to get to the airport, especially for someone who flies as much as Blade\u2019s clientele does, misses the point. The point would be to fly less, or at least to not do frivolous private jet rides everywhere.\n\nAnd it\u2019s a point that few people are apparently willing or able to entertain. Heyburn says people rarely ask him about the emissions of their trip. When I asked him why, he said that while Blade thinks about ways to be more efficient and offset their emissions, \u201cmost people don\u2019t care.\u201d", "description": "John Hollister is sick of two things: being asked if that\u2019s his real name and the traffic getting to John F.
