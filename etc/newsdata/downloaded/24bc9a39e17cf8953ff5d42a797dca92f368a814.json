I said to him my idea with him hasn't changed. He knows what I want with him.\n\n\"It's the same last year, the first day of pre-season training here and one conversation between me and him. It's the same one month ago and in that way some circumstances didn't help us to be in every moment consistent or available to play.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\n\"The last weeks he was progressively training well, adding his spirit to help us. That conversation this morning is because I wanted to listen to him, how he's thinking now to help us and be with us tomorrow.\n\n\"Then if we are in the same spirit and idea to play. It was a very good conversation.\"", "description": "German World Cup winner Mesut Ozil has played just twice under Unai Emery at Arsenal this season", "authors": ["Jake Polden", "Image", "Getty Images", "Reuters", "Afp"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20758155.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Real-Madrid-CF-v-RCD-Espanyol-La-Liga.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
