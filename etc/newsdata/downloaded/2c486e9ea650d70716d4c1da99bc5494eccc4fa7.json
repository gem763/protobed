We think hydrogen is going to have its time, and we thought that the best thing would be to target the export of hydrogen, and do something that's quite large scale,\" said Mr Kallis.\n\nHe explained that the basic concept is to produce hydrogen through the electrolysis of desalinated water sourced from the ocean nearby, using a combination of about 70 per cent wind and 30 per cent solar to power the process.\n\nNatural gas can also be used to power this process, but it's the wind and sun factor that gives this particular approach its 'green' status.\n\nHydrogen Renewables Australia and Nanda Aboriginal Corporation are negotiating an Indigenous Land Use Agreement for the Western Australian site that is planned to be finalised during 2020.\n\nRight now the site is predominantly used for grazing and seaside camping. Mr Kallis, who has been in the renewable energy development space for twenty years, said it's the perfect place for the project due its bounty of breeze and rays and its proximity to Asia.\n\nMr Kallis said for the next 18 months to 2 years, the company will monitor the wind and solar at the site while kicking off a full development approval process at the same time.\n\nHydrogen Renewables Australia chairman Terry Kallis said that the coastal site is prime property for solar and wind power generation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSiemens has come on board as Hydrogen Renewables Australia's technology partner to provide the electrolysers.\n\nSiemens chairman and Australian chief executive Jeff Connolly said that the company's electrolysers, called Siemens Silyzers, are \"particularly well suited to the intermittent nature of renewables\".\n\n\"The exceptional combined wind and solar attributes of this site makes it ideal for green hydrogen production,\" said Mr Connolly.\n\n\"Australia is a potential giant in hydrogen production and the opportunities are enormous. Siemens are in discussions with many significant hydrogen projects across Australia and it\u2019s time to move to real projects rather than just pilot projects. The global demand for green hydrogen will grow as coal phases out and countries strive to meet their renewable energy and C02 targets.\"", "description": "Siemens and Hydrogen Renewables Australia have teamed up to set up a new, large-scale \"green hydrogen\" project in Western Australia.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.3338%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_190/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7acf1db2711bf2e7172e5799cbe69792f8d23dfa", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
