(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nMedia critic\n\nIt\u2019s often said that great partners finish each other\u2019s sentences. With that in mind, we present to you White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham and Fox News host Brian Kilmeade.\n\nIn a chat on Monday morning\u2019s edition of \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d Grisham was talking about how the White House handles questions from reporters. The last official White House press briefing happened in March, under previous press secretary Sarah Sanders. When will the next one be? \u201cUltimately if the president decides it\u2019s something we should do, we can do that but right now he\u2019s doing just fine,\u201d said Grisham, who\u2019d noted the president\u2019s frequent availability for Q&A sessions. \u201cAnd to be honest, the briefings have become a lot of theater and I think that a lot of reporters were doing it to, uh --\u201d\n\n\u201cGet famous,\u201d Kilmeade interjected.\n\n\u201cGet famous, yeah,\u201d responded Grisham. \u201cThey\u2019re writing books now. They\u2019re all getting famous off of this presidency and I think it\u2019s great what we\u2019re doing now.\u201d\n\nGod forbid that journalists might write books.\n\nAs Kilmeade noted, this was Grisham\u2019s first time on the \u201cFox & Friends\u201d couch, and the sycophantic treatment she received should guarantee return engagements. Co-host Ainsley Earhardt went so far as to use the first-person plural in reference to White House actions. After Grisham referenced Trump\u2019s availability to the media, Earhardt said, \u201cSo is this the new press briefing? Before we saw all of his press secretaries in front of the podium. Sean Spicer, they made fun of him on \u2018Saturday Night Live.\u2019...You\u2019ll never have that moment because no longer are we doing that, right?\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s more: Kilmeade sought Grisham\u2019s feedback about his supposition that President Trump took \u201cpersonal\u201d the media\u2019s treatment of Spicer and Sanders. \u201cAbsolutely, I think that it\u2019s so important that the spokesperson for the president can adequately speak to his policies and get his message out there and I think the president saw that that\u2019s not what was happening,\u201d said Grisham. \u201cIt had become, again, theater and they weren\u2019t being good to his people and he doesn\u2019t like that. He\u2019s very loyal to his people and he put a stop to it.\u201d\n\nBold added to remind folks of the moment from a June 2018 Sanders press briefing when she told CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta, \u201cI know it\u2019s hard for you to understand even short sentences.\"\n\nSo driven is the \u201cFox & Friends\u201d team by boot-licking imperatives that they apparently don\u2019t bother to pause and consider: Hey, Fox News has a correspondent who hangs out at the White House and who benefited from press briefings when they used to happen. And despite all the baloney you heard in the Grisham segment, there\u2019s one big reason the press briefings have died: There\u2019s just no way to defend lies and incompetence on the scale that President Trump generates each day. The job is undoable, as both Spicer and Sanders proved every time that they approached the podium. Sanders bailed out not long after the Mueller report revealed that she had lied to reporters in May 2017 when she asserted implausibly that she\u2019d received supportive comments from FBI officials following Trump\u2019s firing of then-FBI Director James Comey.\n\nInstead people like Sanders and Grisham have flocked to places like \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d where there is no such thing as fact-checking. In Monday\u2019s sweet visit, Kilmeade complimented Trump on his environmental instincts: \u201cHe wants the cleanest energy possible, he likes the innovation. He doesn\u2019t like the legislation from the world community,\u201d he said, sounding very much unlike anyone in the press briefing room.\n\nGrisham responded, \u201cThat is correct. We\u2019ve got the best water and the best air in the world and he\u2019s proud of that and we talk about that often.\u201d\n\nIf only we actually had the best water and the best air in the world. But rather than press Grisham on her bogus environmental talking points, the \u201cFox & Friends\" crowd turned to first lady Melania Trump and her \u201cspectacular\u201d state dinner on Friday night.", "description": "'He's his own best spokesperson,' says White House press secretary on the morning show.", "authors": ["Erik Wemple", "Media Critic With A Focus On The Ups", "Downs", "Downs Of The Cable-News Industry.", "Media Critic", "September At Pm", "The Washington Post'S Media Critic", "Focuses On The Cable-News Industry.
