In January 2016, Donald Trump, marveling at the loyalty of his followers, boasted, \u201cI could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, okay, and I wouldn\u2019t lose any voters, okay? It\u2019s, like, incredible.\u201d\n\nNearly four years later, the Republican\u2019s lawyers have suggested a similar tack while fighting to keep Trump\u2019s tax returns hidden. The president\u2019s legal team, hired specifically to shield his secret financial documents, have effectively argued that Trump could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, there would be no way to hold him accountable so long as the president is in office.\n\nThis morning, Team Trump didn\u2019t just hint at this argument; as NBC News\u2019 Pete Williams reported, the president\u2019s lawyers were quite explicit on this point during court proceedings.\n\nA panel of three federal appeals court judges appeared to be unreceptive Wednesday to President Donald Trump\u2019s claim that local prosecutors cannot get his financial records as long as he\u2019s in office \u2014 and heard an extreme hypothetical from the president\u2019s lawyers making the case. The long-standing view of the Justice Department is that a president cannot be indicted while in office. William Consovoy, Trump\u2019s lawyer, told the Second Circuit Court of Appeals that the immunity extends to the entire criminal justice process, including grand jury subpoenas for documents.\n\nJudge Denny Chin on the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals specifically asked William Consovoy, Trump\u2019s lawyer about the \u201cFifth Avenue\u201d argument.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m talking about while in office. Nothing could be done? That\u2019s your position?\u201d Chin asked. Consovoy replied, \u201cThat is correct.\u201d\n\nJust so we\u2019re all clear, this is an argument rooted in the idea that the sitting president isn\u2019t just immune from prosecution; he\u2019s also immune from scrutiny. As Rachel noted on Twitter, as far as Team Trump is concerned, the president can\u2019t even be investigated while in office.\n\nBecause there are multiple ongoing lawsuits surrounding the president\u2019s hidden tax returns, it\u2019s easy to get confused about the various cases. This morning\u2019s appellate court argument stems from an investigation launched by a New York district attorney\u2019s office, which is investigating Trump\u2019s hush-money scandal.\n\nThe DA\u2019s office subpoenaed the president\u2019s accounting firm, Mazars USA, for several years\u2019 worth of personal and business tax returns.\n\nAt the lower court, Trump\u2019s legal team argued in that case that a sitting American president cannot be investigated by anyone for any reason, no matter how serious the underlying accusation. The district court judge disagreed and ruled in prosecutors\u2019 favor.\n\nThe matter is now before the 2nd Circuit, and the issue may very well end up before the U.S. Supreme Court.", "description": "It's amazing just how far Donald Trump's lawyers will go to try to keep his tax returns hidden.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/videos/n_ari_lynching_191022_1920x1080.jpg?itok=Zt-WFgRW", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
