Before challenging this I must be honest: I am not a great reader of politicians\u2019 tomes. I have never read Alan Clarke\u2019s diaries, although I really do intend to, one day.\n\nI have read only one political autobiography: Harriet Harman\u2019s A Woman\u2019s Work. This is more than just the securing of a legacy, it was the rewriting of political tales, with the women included. In most political biographies, the women are someone\u2019s wife, someone\u2019s secretary (there is some crossover) or Angelina Jolie. Harman\u2019s book is about how political women changed women\u2019s lives in the UK, which is in fact the point of politics. It\u2019s not a game of thrones.\n\nSticking with the theme of reality, Isabel Hardman\u2019s book Why We Get the Wrong Politicians is almost painfully on the nose. It looks at candidates on the ground, on every doorstep, at every community bake sale \u2013 all for nought if your supreme leader floats a ridiculous policy weeks before the election, or falls in the sea. The book is a window on to how candidates are selected by a precious few local party members; it looks at constituency surgeries, and whipping that makes MPs vote against their own interests. It captures our daily lives better than any other book I\u2019ve read. It is more generous than the title suggests, but is realistically cynical with it.\n\nAs a kid of Northern Irish ancestry who in 2001 had to run through the streets of Birmingham, fleeing what is seen as the final bombing of the Troubles on the UK mainland, the political language of Northern Ireland is Technicolor to me. So much has been written, but the most compelling account of the peace process is Jonathan Powell\u2019s Great Hatred, Little Room. Powell was Tony Blair\u2019s chief of staff throughout the peace process, and the book handles one of the greatest events of my lifetime with deft language and generous humanity. I was raised around strong opinions on the subject, in the shadow of those lives lost in my city, and this book allowed me to see through the hatred. In these times, when that peace is so fragile, this book should be compulsory reading.\n\nIn the world of fiction, politics usually appears considerably more exciting than it is. In Anatomy of a Scandal by Sarah Vaughan, about an MP on trial for sexual violence, it is not the story but the atmosphere and attitude of the entitled that feel painfully realistic. The expectations of political greatness and privilege are brilliantly and realistically portrayed. I was left raging by how such a seemingly monstrous characterisation could be so very recognisable to me.\n\nBut there is no work of literature that reflects better the political language I grew with than The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole Aged 13 \u00be. This wild and extended family talked of politics in the way my family did in the Thatcher era. Political books are so often written from the perspective of the politicians, not from the point of view of the people. Sue Townsend\u2019s books are overtly political and represent the language of my constituents better than any lofty diary ever could. As Adrian says: \u201cMrs Thatcher has got eyes like a psychotic killer, but a voice like a gentle person. It is a bit confusing.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Truth to Power: 7 Ways to Call Time on B.S. by Jess Phillips is published by Monoray (\u00a39.99).
