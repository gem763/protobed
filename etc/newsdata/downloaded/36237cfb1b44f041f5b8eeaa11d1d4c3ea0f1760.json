Succeeding him is a half brother of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has centralized power within the Saudi state since becoming heir to the throne in 2017.\n\nIt is the first time Saudi Arabia has placed a royal in charge of the energy ministry, breaking with tradition that put non-royals at the helm of the finance and oil ministries.\n\nLast month, Mr. Falih, one of the architects of Saudi Arabia\u2019s plan to diversify its economy beyond oil, lost his role as the kingdom\u2019s chief industrial decision maker, a move some Saudi officials said was due to his failure to show progress on the kingdom\u2019s crucial reform plans. Within days, he was removed as chairman of Saudi Aramco and from its board of directors.\n\nMr. Falih has been a key ally for Prince Mohammed, helping to guide the kingdom\u2019s economy. The veteran oil official inherited the industrial and mining sectors when he was appointed energy minister in 2016.\n\nMr. Falih couldn\u2019t immediately be reached for comment.\n\nThe move to replace him as Aramco chairman, people familiar with the matter have said, was intended to further separate the powerful Saudi energy ministry from the governance of Saudi Aramco, the oil colossus that is seeking to list a sliver of itself on public markets as early as this year.\n\nMr. Falih\u2019s firing is another sign of the turbulence surrounding the crown prince\u2019s initiative to transform the Saudi economy and make it less dependent on oil. That plan has stalled in recent years as Prince Mohammed has led a crackdown on potential challenges to his to power that complicated efforts to attract foreign investment.\n\nIn 2017, the government detained dozens of business figures and elite Saudis in the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh in what the government said was a corruption crackdown. In 2018, a Saudi government team killed dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul. Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s killing and other actions caused some foreign businesses to stay away.\n\nPrince Mohammed held Mr. Falih responsible for the lack of advancement in the economic reform plan, according to Saudi officials. His departure came quickly, but was expected, a senior Saudi official said.\n\nMr. Falih\u2019s removal comes as Prince Mohammed moves to further consolidate power within the Saudi government. In a reshuffle of top officials last month, the government replaced the head of the royal court, replacing him with a person seen as closer to the crown prince.\n\nWhile Mr. Falih has been publicly supportive of the prince\u2019s idea for an IPO of Aramco stock and a separate plan to make Saudi Arabia a major solar producer, his team has worked to delay or reduce the size of both projects, according to Aramco executives, advisers and Saudi officials.\n\n\u201cThere was hardly anyone else in the government that was trying to gently oppose or tweak ideas that came from the crown prince or those close to him,\u201d said an Aramco executive.\n\nMr. Falih\u2019s removal isn\u2019t expected to change Saudi oil policy, according to Saudi officials.\n\nThe new minister, long a member of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries delegation, has more than three decades of experience in the kingdom\u2019s oil ministry and has served as assistant oil minister, deputy oil minister and state minister for energy affairs.\n\nWith Prince Abdulaziz, OPEC is getting a new, hawkish kingpin who has a reputation inside OPEC for bargaining hard at the table\u2014notably with its chief rival Iran.\n\nPeople who have worked with him say he very focused on minute details, such as flower arrangements or finger food. An OPEC official who held talks with him said he once delayed the conclusion of Saudi quota negotiations over a single barrel of oil a day\u2014despite the kingdom having a capacity of 12 million barrels a day.\n\nPrince Abdulaziz was sidelined in the spring 2017 when Prince Mohammed went on the ascent after King Salman became king in 2015. Prince Abdulaziz was moved to a less-influential position as state energy minister in April 2017.\n\nStill, he gradually regained influence and was given responsibility to negotiate the reopening of joint oil fields with Kuwait and convince the U.S. to sell its nuclear technologies to the kingdom, according to people who know him.\n\n\u2014Donna Abdulaziz in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, contributed to this article\n\nWrite to Summer Said at summer.said@wsj.com, Jared Malsin at jared.malsin@wsj.com and Benoit Faucon at benoit.faucon@wsj.com", "description": "Saudi Arabia relieved its energy minister Khalid al-Falih from his post, less than a week after he was removed as chairman of its state-owned oil giant.
