Instead, she emphasized that a lack of quality addiction treatment in the U.S. remains a major factor driving the crisis, not that more arrests aren\u2019t being made.\n\nThe Post\u2019s enforcement frame, applied to Obama, was peculiarly also applied to Trump\u2019s \u201cfailure to act,\u201d despite the fact that his first attorney general was Jeff Sessions, whom experts in drug policy called a \u201cDrug War dinosaur.\u201d In one of Sessions\u2019s first major speeches in his new post, he emphasized a tough-on-crime, border enforcement strategy to the overdose crisis, while quixotically promoting debunked \u201cJust Say No\u201d drug education strategies. \u201cIn the \u201980s and \u201990s, we saw how campaigns stressing prevention brought down drug use and addiction,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can do this again.\u201d You can accuse the Trump administration of lots of things, but you cannot say they are \u201csoft on drugs.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, as deputy attorney general, Rosenstein promised to sue any programs that attempted to open facilities allowing people to inject drugs under medical supervision, called supervised consumption sites. More than 100 such facilities operate successfully across Western Europe, Canada, and Australia. During an unprecedented rise in drug deaths, the blob won\u2019t even flirt with new public health\u2013focused approaches. The Washington Post, for its part, neglects to open the door for innovative harm reduction strategies that go against the Beltway drug enforcement consensus. In contrast, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation published a piece last June declaring that British Columbia\u2019s death toll would be double what it is today without harm reduction.\n\nThe term \u201charm reduction\u201d is part of a paradigm of pragmatic strategies aimed at keeping people who use drugs alive. It does not appear once in any of the Post\u2019s three investigations. When reporting about Obama\u2019s inaction, the Post did not mention that his administration lifted an absurd rule that prevented federal funding for syringe-access programs, but that when the House flipped back to Republican control, the ban was reinstated. (After a massive HIV outbreak in rural Indiana, Republicans partially lifted the ban.)\n\nOther efforts, like doctors fighting to remove onerous barriers that prevent people from accessing life-saving medications like methadone and buprenorphine, also go unmentioned. During the \u201990s, when France implemented what\u2019s called a \u201clow threshold model\u201d that allowed any physician to prescribe buprenorphine on-demand, the overdose death rate plunged by 79 percent. Such a policy should be seriously considered stateside, but unfortunately not by any sources quoted by the Post.\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to Congress. What, precisely, did Congress fail to do, aside from put communities at risk of HIV and Hep C by defunding syringe programs? The investigation spells out how Congress neglected to fully fund programs to the tune of many billions of dollars that experts like LaBelle argue are needed to rebuild America\u2019s crumbling treatment infrastructure. Indeed, that\u2019s a massive failure for which Congress is solely responsible. But other actions Congress failed to take, per the Post, involve bills collecting dust that would put sanctions on China, Mexico, and other countries that \u201caren\u2019t cooperating with U.S. efforts to outlaw fentanyl.\u201d\n\nHighlighting bills that would sanction countries that source America\u2019s demand for drugs illustrates the boundaries of what\u2019s possible in drug policy. America has long flexed its Drug War muscles in countries like Colombia and Mexico by providing billions of dollars in military aid. For example, the DEA helped orchestrate the assassination of Pablo Escobar and the eventual capture, prosecution, and conviction of Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n. But America has no authority to fly attack helicopters into China, raid labs manufacturing fentanyl, or assassinate rogue chemists. The force of America\u2019s global Drug War stops at China\u2019s door, where the preferred strong arm of enforcement gives way to the soft arm of diplomacy. Given Trump\u2019s so called trade war with China, the diplomatic route seems to be going nowhere fast.\n\nAnd of course, the flow of illicit drugs into the U.S. from Mexico did not stop after Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s capture. America\u2019s presence in Colombia has also imploded in spectacular fashion. According to the United Nations, in recent years cocaine production in Colombia has hit new records.\n\n\u201cCountries that source America\u2019s drug supply have been telling us the same thing for decades,\u201d says Dan Ciccarone, a physician-researcher at the University of California in San Francisco who studies illicit drug supplies: \u201c\u2018Deal with your [drug] problem, folks.\u2019\u201d Other countries around the world do not see the same astonishing rise in overdose deaths that occurs in the U.S. \u201cFun-loving, pleasure-seeking countries around the world do not have a drug problem as severe as ours is,\u201d Ciccarone said. \u201cAnd they all have rational drug policies: demand reduction and harm reduction, and we just haven\u2019t done it.\u201d\n\nFocused on extending America\u2019s global drug war and punishing countries that produce drugs, no Congress member quoted by the Post seemed curious to understand why Americans have an insatiable demand for substances that relieve pain stemming from trauma, economic hardship, and deteriorating living conditions. These politicians are witnessing an unprecedented decline in health among swaths of people in Appalachia, the Midwest, and New England\u2014areas where free-trade policies caused factories to close and manufacturing jobs to disappear, putting the possibility of living a comfortable middle-class life out of reach.\n\nResearchers recently linked free-trade policies to a rise in overdose deaths. For every 1,000 people who lost jobs due to free-trade policies that caused manufacturing jobs to disappear, there was an 11.3 percent jump in overdose deaths.\n\n\u201cPeople will say, \u2018What\u2019s the evidence for demand reduction?\u2019 Well, why don\u2019t we just give it a serious effort? Why don\u2019t we fund a one- or two-generation serious effort like we\u2019ve done with supply reduction?\u201d Ciccarone asked. \u201cLet\u2019s work on community resilience, let\u2019s work on individual resilience, let\u2019s work on treatment and harm reduction to see whether it works.\u201d\n\nCiccarone\u2019s plea for a new drug policy paradigm is anathema to the square-jawed enforcers among Washington\u2019s consultant class. Take, for instance, John Walters and David Murray, both of whom currently work at the conservative Hudson Institute in Washington. The duo were appointed to the ONDCP by President George W. Bush. They\u2019re the authors of hits like \u201cKill All the Poppies,\u201d a piece of pure hubris published in Foreign Policy that represents the Drug War at its most belligerent: crop eradication, crippling local economies, and cajoling other countries to stop feeding our drug habit.\n\nWalters, who was frequently lambasted in his role as Bush\u2019s drug czar for hiding from the press, was quoted in two out of the three Washington Post investigations. And the Post has also recently given a platform to Murray, who worked as \u201cchief scientist\u201d under Walters at ONDCP.\n\nDuring a 2018 Washington Post forum, the moderator asked Murray what could go wrong with harm reduction. Murray\u2019s response perfectly foreshadowed how the Post framed its opioid investigations: \u201cI\u2019m worried that we\u2019re neglecting one of the critical tools here. ... If you\u2019re not reducing the supply and availability [of drugs], you\u2019re not enabling people to have incentives to move into treatment.\u201d\n\nThe Walters and Murray theory of muscular drug enforcement has been the consensus in Washington for decades. And it clearly hasn\u2019t worked, though you wouldn\u2019t know that from the Post. \u201cThat\u2019s what this is, a failure of imagination,\u201d Ciccarone says. \u201cWe haven\u2019t tried a new paradigm, and that\u2019s the real failure.\u201d", "description": "The paper's otherwise stellar investigative journalism accidentally exposes the failed Beltway consensus.", "authors": ["Zachary Siegel"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/5b42e78284f6dda137e97aed269bbe7e0e80a048.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
