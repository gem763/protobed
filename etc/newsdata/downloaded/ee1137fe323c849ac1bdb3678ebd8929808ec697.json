House Democrats are charging headlong into this impeachment business against President Donald Trump, a shamelessly naked political spectacle in which they\u2019re trying to overturn the results of the 2016 election. They tried to get him on Russian collusion. They couldn\u2019t. Now, they\u2019re using this whistleblower report that alleged in a July phone call that Trump threatened to withhold military aid from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky unless he opened a corruption probe into Hunter Biden. The son of the former vice president was on the board of an energy company making $50,000/month while his father, Joe Biden, was in office. Hunter has zero experience in the energy sector. It was a gross conflict of interest issue, and the allegation that he was just there to sell access to the higher echelons of America\u2019s political class hasn\u2019t really been dispelled.\n\nThe whistleblower is a registered Democrat, a reported CIA agent, and someone who had worked with a 2020 Democratic candidate. They were also on the National Security Council staff for the Obama White House. This person does not have first-hand knowledge of wrongdoing. It\u2019s all second-hand sourced, which explains the numerous errors. Adam Schiff\u2019s staff was in contact with this person, and Schiff knew of the contents of the report before it was formally filed. Yeah, this isn\u2019t a biased political hit job in the slightest, right? The Trump White House released a transcript of the Trump-Zelensky phone call, which petty much torpedoed the juicy allegations lobbed by Democrats, but that\u2019s not going to stop this impeachment push. This whole effort is mostly being done behind closed doors. The impeachment of a president is very much a public affair. That\u2019s precisely what the Democrats don\u2019t want.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal\u2019s Kimberley Strassel has a new book about the anti-Trump Deep State, but her Potomac Watch column this week detailed the absurd rule High Chancellor of Impeachment Adam Schiff has instituted that made Rep. Elise Stefanik's (R-NY) jaw drop; Stefanik sits on the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty simple. Democrats will summarize all of the interviews conducted relating to this unofficial Trump impeachment into one page\u2014which can only be read with a Democratic staffer present. Schiff, whom Strassel calls \u201cLord High Impeacher,\u201d is withholding documents as well. It\u2019s all part of the larger scheme: controlling the narrative. Strassel notes how Democrats learned from their lessons regarding Trump-Russia collusion, and how the various open hearings embarrassed them and tore huge holes into the narrative because it was trash to begin with. They\u2019re not making the same mistake twice; optics be damned (via WSJ):\n\nDemocrats had informed Republicans that, from here on out, the committee would produce a single, printed transcript of every interview it conducted as part of its impeachment inquiry. Only members of the three committees involved in the purported inquiry would be allowed to view that printout, and only in the presence of a Democratic staffer. Ms. Stefanik\u2014an elected member of Congress who sits on the Intelligence Committee\u2014will be babysat while reading by an unelected employee of the Democrats. [\u2026] Democrats view control over the narrative as essential, having learned from their Russia-collusion escapade the perils of transparency. They banked on special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation proving impeachment fodder, but got truth-bombed. Their subsequent open hearings on the subject\u2014featuring Michael Cohen, Mr. Mueller and Corey Lewandowski \u2014were, for the Democrats, embarrassing spectacles, at which Republicans punched gaping holes in their story line. Mr. Schiff is making sure that doesn\u2019t happen again; he\u2019ll present the story, on his terms. His rules mean he can issue that controlling decree about \u201conly one\u201d transcript and Democratic staff supervision of Republican members. It means he can bar the public, the press and even fellow representatives from hearings, even though they\u2019re unclassified. It means he is able to shield from scrutiny the whistleblower who prompted this impeachment proceeding. It means he can continue barring Republicans from calling opposing witnesses. It means he can continue refusing to allow White House counsel in the room to hear the accusations against the president. [\u2026] Mr. Schiff has intimated he will eventually make some things public. But Democrats\u2019 barring of Republicans and the White House from this \u201cfact finding\u201d stage ensures what is presented later will be a one-sided narrative. How could any senator vote to convict based on such a rigged proceeding?\n\nStrassel adds that only 106 of the 435 members of the House of Representatives are privy to the details of this secret, politically motivated impeachment witch hunt due to committee assignments, which means the vast majority of the people\u2019s representatives are in the dark about all this stuff. They have no access to the documents. There\u2019s also another reason why Democrats don\u2019t want an official vote on this impeachment stuff\u2014it would mean the playing field is level. The GOP would be able to get access to documents and subpoena their own witnesses who will undoubtedly torch every point the Democrats have been making with this attempted coup. Yes, you can argue it\u2019s a coup: a group of lawmakers from the opposing party working in secret to remove a duly elected president. It fits the bill, and for it to work, Schiff has to act like a dark lord of the Sith. We\u2019ll find out soon enough what garbage evidence they\u2019ve compiled in this effort to remove Trump. In the meantime, God Bless people, like Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), who aren\u2019t going to sit around and let this circus continue unmolested.", "description": ".10/25/2019 18:03:51PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien", "Timothy Meads", "Julio Rosas"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/269/ccba51c4-ea60-4f5b-9d9a-e3a266faf8bb.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
