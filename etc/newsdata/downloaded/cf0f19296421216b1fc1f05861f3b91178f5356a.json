Deep, sharp partisan loyalties cement the bond, burnished by bulletins from @realdonaldtrump, Fox News and similarly attuned voices.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s sanity is not the question. The real issue is how he got into office | Gary Younge Read more\n\nTo this assay of the Trump base\u2019s psychological composition, Gwyneth H McClendon would have us add its members\u2019 sense of where they stand socially among their peers.\n\nPeople tend to envy neighbors who have more than they do, to spite those who have less, and to crave local admiration. These emotions, McClendon shows through elaborate data analysis, have the power to get people to take political positions at odds with their material interests.\n\nThe envious, the spiteful and the seekers of recognition will sacrifice time, money and even personal safety \u2013 McClendon focuses on protesters in one of her case studies \u2013 in order to satisfy their urges.\n\nHer big insight is that the seething and yearning focuses not on class conflict, but the Joneses. That is, while emotional cues may come from national voices, it\u2019s the people nextdoor who churn minds to the point where their bodies will clamber into the arenas of politics.\n\nWhen the folks down the street happen to be immigrants or of different color, I would dare to add, the aggravation increases.\n\nParsing the emotional contents of political movements (the emotion-movement word echo is deliberate) traces back, as do so many topics, to Aristotle. His psychological analysis in Book II of On Rhetoric was geared toward enhancing persuasive power; he discussed emotions in pairs, with anger and calm up first and envy and emulation at the end.\n\nThis dichotomous approach is invaluable for political practitioners, a guide to parsing leaders\u2019 speeches and constructing counter-demagogic strategies. Civility is a virtue but not a counter-strategy, as anyone who has ever tried to calm an angry person by telling him to calm down knows.\n\nContemporary philosophers of political emotion have taken up the question of what to do about the envious.\n\nMartha Nussbaum has prescribed a \u201cmandatory program of youth national civil service\u201d of three years\u2019 duration. John Rawls argued that strengthening the proverbial social safety net could mitigate these feelings. Judith Shklar proposed that status should be publicly awarded on multiple dimensions of comparison so more may benefit.\n\nFrom Aristotle to Angela Davis: the best books about debate Read more\n\nMcClendon cites these and other philosophers but offers no remedies of her own, focusing her last chapter instead on sketching out a fuller research program.\n\nAlthough I wouldn\u2019t make it mandatory, Nussbaum\u2019s idea sounds right to me, in that it would award people badges for working with their neighbors and thus diverting them from stewing about their possessions.\n\nAmong the viable presidential candidates at this writing, Pete Buttigieg\u2019s public service program stands out on this score. His plan calls for developing a Climate Corps, a Community Health Corps and a Inter-generational Service Corps. Service fellows would be considered for student debt forgiveness, hiring preference and vocational training.\n\nThe Peace Corps stamps souls for a lifetime, as a conversation with any alum will demonstrate. Public service programs can make a base more noble.", "description": "A fascinating study indicates that the president\u2019s base support is based on more than political animus alone", "authors": ["Michael Cornfield"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ef96ceaeefe97d15d1ed2a15b1e4fba94288542/0_17_4911_2948/master/4911.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=13b6ee048726e6d736f4ace4f93527a9", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
