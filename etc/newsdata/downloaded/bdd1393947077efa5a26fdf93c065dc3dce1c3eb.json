That clause gives Facebook broad leeway to make those determinations, which at times will still be a political calculation, much to the platform\u2019s chagrin.\n\n\u201cI know some people will say we should go further,\u201d Clegg admitted, asking for an audience at the Atlantic Festival to \u201cimagine the reverse.\u201d\n\nIn the U.S. alone, the left and right couldn\u2019t be further from a consensus on what kind of online content is harmful. Even among major tech platforms, Facebook goes to great lengths to avoid displays of political partisanship.\n\nFacebook will also apply a higher standard when money is involved, meaning that political ads will be governed by its normal rules, not its stated exception for newsworthiness.\n\nUnder its current set of rules, Facebook would act to limit the spread of the viral video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi because the video isn\u2019t political speech that originated with a politician protected by Facebook\u2019s newsworthiness clause.\n\n\u201cAt Facebook, our role is to make sure there is a level playing field, not to be a political participant ourselves,\u201d Clegg said.\n\n\u201cTo use tennis as an analogy, our job is to make sure the court is ready\u2014the surface is flat, the lines painted, the net at the correct height. But we don\u2019t pick up a racket and start playing. How the players play the game is up to them, not us.\u201d\n\nIn Facebook\u2019s metaphor, the ref is nowhere to be found.", "description": "\u201cTo use tennis as an analogy, our job is to make sure the court is ready.\u201d", "authors": ["Taylor Hatmaker", "Senior Technology Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569366962/GettyImages-936177714_1_ddmeo4", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
