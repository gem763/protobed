The polls have him far ahead: YouGov had 36% of voters backing his Conservatives, with Labour in second place on 23%. But his move is still a risky one. Here are the ways it could go wrong.\n\nPolling Error\n\nRemember the 2015 U.K. election shock? And the 2016 Brexit referendum shock? And the 2017 U.K. election shock? A common feature of all of them was a failure of the polling companies to properly detect a shift in public opinion.\n\nAt the very time that we want faster, better data from them, pollsters face unprecedented challenges. In particular, they struggle to reach younger, more mobile voters, those who might be expected to oppose Johnson\u2019s Conservatives and Brexit.\n\nVotes vs Seats\n\nEven if the pollsters get close with the total vote share, translating it into the thing that matters, seats in Parliament, is very hard. Votes can pile up unevenly. In 2017, the Tories won 42% of the vote, but 49% of the seats. Labour won 40% of both.\n\nTory Fatigue\n\nThe Conservatives have now been in power for nine years, and even Cabinet ministers acknowledge privately that the last three of those years haven\u2019t been a great advertisement for Tory government. The party\u2019s recent discovery of unity behind Johnson might not outweigh years of infighting and indecision.\n\nHard Times\n\nIt\u2019s not just that the Tories have been in power for a long time, they\u2019ve been in power for a long time while people haven\u2019t got any richer. According to the Office for National Statistics, median weekly earnings are still 2.9% below their 2008 level. That\u2019s not a great backdrop for an election.\n\nBrexit Factor\n\nJohnson\u2019s slogan, \u201cGet Brexit Done,\u201d feels like an appealing message to a public weary of months of knife-edge votes and reverses. But it\u2019s also an admission that this government has had a single project since 2016, has failed to deliver on it, and everyone is sick of waiting.\n\nJohnson hopes to turn that frustration into votes for Conservatives. But voters could conclude that Brexit was a Conservative project -- a Johnson project, in fact -- and that if they\u2019re tired of it, they need someone different in charge.\n\nThe failure to complete the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the EU also leaves the door open to Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit Party to take votes away from the Tories. If Farage does well enough to stop Tories winning key seats, Corbyn could ultimately benefit.\n\nMoney\u2019s Tight\n\nJohnson\u2019s other message is that by getting Brexit dealt with, he will be able to focus on spending money on things people do like, such as schools and hospitals. This too is an admission of failure.\n\nAfter nine years of spending restrictions, Britain\u2019s public services are squeezed: libraries are closing, knife crime is rising, numbers of rough sleepers are increasing. Labour will be very happy to fight an election on the question of who is better at spending money on things.\n\nCharacter Flaws\n\nThe Conservatives are pinning a lot of their hopes on Johnson\u2019s undoubted fame. Unlike his predecessor Theresa May, he enjoys campaigning. But that fame brings a problem. Most people have made up their minds what they think of Johnson, and a lot of them don\u2019t like him.\n\nAccording to YouGov, 47% of people have a negative opinion of him, against 33% who have a positive one. Labour is pushing hard on Johnson\u2019s tendency to go back on promises.\n\nThe Conservatives, too, plan to make much of their opponent\u2019s character: Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has even worse scores than Johnson: 58% negative, against 23% positive. But at the last election, Corbyn was able to shrug off criticism of his past statements.\n\nMixed Messages\n\nJohnson risks losing a whole load of Conservative seats in places that don\u2019t like Brexit too: southern England, and Scotland. According to Joe Twyman of Deltapoll, that leaves the prime minister trying to pull off a difficult trick.\n\n\u201cHe needs to convince Remain-leaning Conservative voters to forget Brexit and vote Conservative,\" Twyman said. \"At the same time convince Leave-leaning Labour voters to hold their noses about him and vote for Brexit.\u201d\n\nRight Votes, Wrong Places\n\nA different version of the same problem is that the Conservatives\u2019 strongly pro-Brexit message helps them do very well in areas they already hold. According to Twyman, of the 50 most \u201cLeave\u201d areas, 24 are already Conservative. Extra votes there don\u2019t help.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Boris Johnson has succeeded, finally, in getting Parliament to give him the general election that he wants.
