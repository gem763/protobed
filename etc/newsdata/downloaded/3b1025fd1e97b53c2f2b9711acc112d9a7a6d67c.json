Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar are endorsing Bernie Sanders for president.\n\nThe Sanders campaign confirmed the backing of two members of \u201cThe Squad\u201d on Tuesday evening.\n\nThe endorsements are a major boon for the 78-year-old Vermont senator, who has faced questions over his health since suffering a heart attack two weeks ago.\n\nThe 30-year-old Ocasio-Cortez and 38-year-old Omar are progressive stars and frequent targets of President Donald Trump.\n\nSanders\u2019 deputy communications director Sarah Ford says Ocasio-Cortez will appear with the senator at a rally in her home district in New York this weekend.
