The pendulum swings from spareness to exuberance, from season to season, sometimes within one collection: The spring 2019 Carolina Herrera show included both over-the-top florals and austere white shirts. But when we describe a little black dress as minimalist and a garish Gucci handbag as maximalist, what\u2019s the context? Here\u2019s an extremely abridged history of aesthetics:\n\nKEEP QUIET Clockwise from top left: Steve Jobs in 2008; Gwyneth Paltrow in \u2018Great Expectations\u2019; The Church of the Light; A fall 2019 Celine look; A 1976 silk jersey evening gown by Halston; Donald Judd with one of his works in 1966; Bruder Klaus Field Chapel; A viewer studying a Mark Rothko painting; Strong suits in \u2018Reservoir Dogs\u2019; The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York\n\nMinimalism\n\nCritic Richard Wollheim popularized the term \u201cminimal art\u201d in a 1965 essay about the movement associated with ascetic obsessives such as Ad Reinhardt. Broadly, it implied a certain restraint and focus on materials. These days, we wantonly apply the interchangeable \u201cminimal\u201d and \u201cminimalist\u201d to anything reasonably subdued, from sneakers to wedding cakes. But plenty of minimalist-looking things, like Shaker chairs and clerical clothing, predate the minimal art moment.\n\nThe purity of religion often inspires spare design that gets labeled minimalist. The stark lines of the boxlike Church of the Light in Osaka, Japan, completed in 1989, have much in common with Celine\u2019s fashion stores, as newly reimagined by creative director Hedi Slimane. One could imagine male models, in his sharp suits and skinny ties, walking reverently through the chapel\u2019s pews.\n\nMr. Slimane\u2019s menswear harks back to the minimalist look that prevailed in the \u201990s, when Helmut Lang\u2019s sober black suits and white shirts aligned with those worn in Quentin Tarantino\u2019s 1992 film \u201cReservoir Dogs.\u201d Donna Karan \u2019s sleek, all-green wardrobe for Gwyneth Paltrow in 1998\u2019s \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d another minimalist touchstone, recalled the jersey column gowns that Halston designed for the Studio 54 crowd in the \u201970s.\n\nContemporary designers like Lucie and Luke Meier for Jil Sander adopt an undeniably minimalist approach, riffing on the white-shirt-and-dark-slacks uniform. And with organizational guru Marie Kondo preaching an uncluttered, thoughtful approach, those clothes continue to sell.\n\nShare Your Thoughts Which camp do you fall in: minimalist or maximalist?\n\nGO WILD Clockwise from top left: Portrait of Henry VIII; David Bowie dressed as \u2018Ziggy Stardust\u2019 in 1973; Harry Styles in 2017; Shoes by Luke Edward Hall and Stubbs & Wootton; Balenciaga \u2018Triple S\u2019 sneaker; Detail from the Sistine Chapel ceiling; A model in front of a Jackson Pollock painting; A Christian Lacroix look from 1993; Joyce Kozloff\u2019s \u2018If I Were an Astronomer: Boston\u2019\n\nMaximalism\n\nBalenciaga\u2019s Triple S sneaker exemplifies modern fashion maximalism. \u201cIt\u2019s big in price tag, big in weight and big in proportion,\u201d said Ms. Marra-Alvarez. Its clashing colors assure it\u2019s big in visual impact, too. But maximalism in fashion\u2014read: anything loud, busy and ornamented\u2014predates this attention-courting kick.\n\nThe 1970s gave us David Bowie\u2019s Ziggy Stardust in metallic jumpsuits and Elton John in rhinestone sunglasses. More recently, pop star Harry Styles, muse to Gucci\u2019s Alessandro Michele, wore a diamond-patterned suit. Dolce & Gabbana\u2018s jacquard suits suggest Tudor England. (King Henry VIII, with his many jewels and many wives, was clearly a maximalist.)\n\nArt critic Robert Pincus-Witten explored this extreme in his 1987 book, \u201cPostminimalism into Maximalism,\u201d which posited that artists like \u201960s sculptor Eva Hesse exploded the constraints of the minimalists. But exuberant art was nothing new: Michelangelo\u2019s Sistine Chapel ceiling, completed in 1512, might be the most maximalist place on Earth.\n\nItaly has always been a spiritual home to maximalism in both art and fashion. It\u2019s the birthplace of the late designer Gianni Versace, whose 1980s and \u201990s fashions, rivaled only by France\u2019s Christian Lacroix, infused the lurid with joie de vivre.\n\nToday, the word could be applied to the unisex patchwork coats from American brand Bode, crafted from vintage textiles. Artist Joyce Kozloff\u2019s \u2018If I Were an Astronomer\u2019 tapestry, currently on display in the Boston ICA\u2019s \u2018Less is a Bore\u2019 exhibit, shares DNA with a Bode jacket. Both are extravagant, completely nonessential and incredibly appealing.", "description": "They might be the most overused words in fashion and art criticism.
