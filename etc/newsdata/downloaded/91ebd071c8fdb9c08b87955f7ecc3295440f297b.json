Somebody suggested that Syria needed to be cleaned out.\n\nSUSAN RICE: That somebody was the President of the United States.\n\nMADISON: Thank you! This is such dangerous language to use that, in essence, is translated across the world as ethnic cleansing.\n\nRICE: Joe, it\u2019s not even a potential, I\u2019m afraid. It\u2019s already beginning to happen. You see the Kurdish leader basically screaming for help, saying this so-called pause, or ceasefire that Mike Pence negotiated, which was a total capitulation to Erdogan and Turkey, basically decided on behalf of the Kurds that they would have to move out of the way while the Turks take over there historic homeland in the north of Syria and repopulate it from Arabs from a different part of Syria. This is the definition of ethnic cleansing.", "description": "Susan Rice equated Trump's move to\u00a0negotiate a ceasefire between Turkey and Kurdish fighters in northern Syria to \"ethnic cleansing.\"", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/06/GettyImages-518582360.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
