Republicans want to test politically vulnerable Democrats with a vote that could be difficult in areas where Trump remains popular. But Pelosi has so far resisted, saying Congress is well within its power to conduct oversight of the executive branch as part of the Constitution\u2019s system of checks and balances, and no vote is needed.\n\nThe inquiry is moving quickly as a steady stream of officials, largely from the State Department, are appearing behind closed doors this week, some providing vivid details about the events surrounding the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in which Trump urged Zelenskiy to investigate a firm tied to political rival Joe Biden\u2019s family and Ukraine\u2019s own involvement in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nIn 10 hours of testimony Monday, a former White House aide, Fiona Hill, recounted that national security adviser John Bolton was so alarmed by Rudy Giuliani\u2019s back-channel activities in Ukraine that he described Trump\u2019s personal lawyer as a \u201chand grenade who is going to blow everybody up.\u201d\n\nThe former White House aide detailed Bolton\u2019s concerns to lawmakers and told them that she had at least two meetings with National Security Council lawyer John Eisenberg about the matter at Bolton\u2019s request, according to a person familiar with the testimony who requested anonymity to discuss the confidential interview.\n\nHill, a top adviser on Russia, also discussed U.S. ambassador Gordon Sondland and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, the person said, telling the three committees leading the investigation that Bolton also told her he was not part of \u201cwhatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up,\u201d an apparent reference to talks over Ukraine.\n\nGiuliani was heavily involved in the effort to pressure Ukraine on the investigations. He said Tuesday he was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d in Bolton\u2019s comment. Bolton, Giuliani said, \u201chas been called much worse.\u201d\n\nGiuliani also acknowledged he had received payments totaling $500,000 related to the work for a company operated by Lev Parnas who, along with associate Igor Fruman, played a key role in Giuliani\u2019s efforts to launch a Ukrainian corruption investigation against Biden and his son, Hunter. The two men were arrested last week on campaign finance charges as they tried to board an international flight.\n\nOn Tuesday, House investigators heard from Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, who was concerned about the \u201cfake news smear\u201d against the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, whom Trump recalled in May, according to emails obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nThe interviews, like the others conducted by House impeachment investigators, took place behind closed doors.\n\nHill also told the investigators that she had strongly and repeatedly objected to Yovanovitch\u2019s ouster, according to the person familiar with the testimony. Yovanovitch testified to the impeachment investigators Friday that Trump pressured the State Department to fire her.\n\nHill quoted Bolton, whom Trump forced out last month, as saying in one conversation that Giuliani was \u201ca hand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up.\u201d\n\nA whistleblower complaint about that call, later made public, prompted Pelosi to launch the impeachment inquiry.\n\nFive more officials are scheduled this week, mostly from the State Department, though it is unclear if they will all appear after Trump declared he wouldn\u2019t cooperate with the probe. Sondland is expected to appear for a deposition under subpoena Thursday and will certainly be asked about those talks.\n\nSondland, who is the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, is expected to tell Congress that a text message released earlier this month reassuring another envoy that there was no quid pro quo in their interactions with Ukraine was based solely on what Trump told him, according to a person familiar with his coming testimony.\n\nThe cache of text messages was provided by one of the inquiry\u2019s first witnesses, former Ukrainian envoy Kurt Volker, and detailed attempts by the diplomats to serve as intermediaries around the time Trump urged Zelenskiy to start the investigations into a company linked to Biden\u2019s son.\n\nMichael McKinley, a former top aide to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who resigned last week, is scheduled to testify Wednesday. McKinley, a career foreign service officer and Pompeo\u2019s de facto chief of staff, resigned Friday, ending a 37-year career.\n\nIn the emails from March, Kent shares with other State Department officials a \u201cdaily update of the fake news driven smear out of Ukraine.\u201d The emails include news reports and other commentary, some from U.S. journalists, that \u201cgoes after Masha,\u201d as Yovanovitch was known.\n\nWhile interviews have focused on the interactions with Ukraine, the probe could broaden as soon as next week to include interviews with White House budget officials who may be able to shed light on whether military aid was withheld from Ukraine as Trump and Giuliani pushed for the investigations.\n\nThe three committees leading the probe are seeking interviews next week with Russell Vought, acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, and Michael Duffey, another OMB official who leads national security programs, according to a person familiar with those requests. That person wasn\u2019t authorized to discuss the invitations and requested anonymity.\n\nOnce Democrats have completed the probe and followed any other threads it produces, they will use their findings to help determine whether to vote on articles of impeachment.\n\nBecause of the Trump administration\u2019s edict, the Democrats have been subpoenaing witnesses as they arrived for their interviews \u2014 a move sometimes known as a \u201cfriendly\u201d subpoena that could give the witnesses additional legal protection as they testify.\n\nOne witness who may not be called before Congress is the still-anonymous government whistleblower who touched off the impeachment inquiry.\n\nRepublicans complained Tuesday that the whistleblower\u2019s identity should be made available.\n\n\u201cThe question I keep coming back to is why don\u2019t we know who this individual is?\u201d Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio said Tuesday. \u201cI mean they\u2019re basing an impeachment process, trying to remove the president of the United States based on some anonymous whistleblower again with no firsthand knowledge.\u201d\n\nTop Democrats say testimony and evidence coming in from other witnesses, and even the Republican president himself, are backing up the whistleblower\u2019s account of Trump\u2019s July 25 phone with Zelenskiy.\n\n__\n\nAssociated Press writers Michael Balsamo, Eric Tucker, Lisa Mascaro, Matthew Lee, Padmananda Rama, Andrew Taylor, Alan Fram and Laurie Kellman in Washington and Jonathan Lemire in Dallas contributed to this report.", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 House Democrats are gauging support for a vote to formally authorize the impeachment inquiry as another official testified Tuesday in", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/15/e156bc_trump-impeachment-57460-george-kent-deputy-assistant-secretary-state-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
