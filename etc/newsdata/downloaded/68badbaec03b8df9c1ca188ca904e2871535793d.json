Several hopefuls for the Democratic presidential nomination have vowed to fix the growing gulf between rich and everyone else, including Senator Elizabeth Warren.\n\nHer plan to tax the fortunes of America's richest families is based on research by Emmanuel Saez, an economist from the University of California Berkeley, who frequently publishes academic research with Piketty.\n\nBy the way, Capital and ideology is published today in France! In a few months in English and other languageshttps://t.co/7ps5Pi7MgG pic.twitter.com/GnokeItioT \u2014 Thomas Piketty (@PikettyLeMonde) September 12, 2019\n\nPiketty's \"Capital in the 21st Century\" sought to explain the growing gulf between rich and poor, with his research finding the rate of return on capital has far outpaced the rate of economic growth. The result in the U.S. has been mounting income inequality, as the wealthiest Americans gain a growing share of the nation's economic spoils. His core argument from the research \u2014 if you're not born rich, you won't become rich \u2014 posed formidable challenges to defenders of the economic status quo and put into question the viability of the American Dream.\n\nHis new book focuses on economies outside the West, with references to India and China and analyses of communist, colonial and slave-owning economies, according to Bloomberg. It also explores the ideologies behind inequality, challenging the notion that the growing concentration of wealth in the U.S. and elsewhere represents a natural state of affairs, the publication added.\n\nWhere is the middle class heading?\n\nThe solutions suggested by Piketty in his newest doorstopper would upend the current capitalist system, where corporate boards are largely composed of wealthy, well-connected shareholders, and taxes on capital are lower than on income. His proposals, according to The Guardian, include:\n\nHalf of the seats on company boards should filled by employees.\n\nNo shareholder should have more than 10% of a company's voting power.\n\nTaxes as high as 90% on the wealthiest estates.\n\nA lump-sum investment of $132,000 provided to everyone when they turn 25 years old.\n\nA personalized carbon tax that would be based on an individual's contribution to climate change.\n\n\n\nEven so, Americans will have to wait to get their hands on an English-language copy of Piketty's newest book. While it's published today in France, the English release won't be available until March 2020.", "description": "The famed economist has some ideas for reducing income inequality, like a 90% tax on the wealthiest estates", "authors": ["Aimee Picchi"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/04/23/a32a63c5-9392-4ea3-b329-d78de6706bf0/thumbnail/1200x630/168b1eb8fb6de1bffe08ae339bf0d0ff/piketty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
