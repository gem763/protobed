After clinging to Beijing\u2019s extradition bill through weeks of protests and violence, her statement today looks like a long-delayed retreat. Lam finally offered to formally withdraw the bill that would have put everyone in Hong Kong at the mercy of Beijing\u2019s police, as well as three other concessions to the protesters demanding democracy and full autonomy from China\u2019s communists:\n\nProtesters are already declaring Lam\u2019s concessions insufficient. They don\u2019t want a dialogue with their oppressors \u2014 they want an independent investigation into their abuses:\n\nHong Kong leader Carrie Lam announced Wednesday she would formally withdraw a bill allowing extradition to mainland China to \u201callay public concerns,\u201d meeting the least difficult of five protester demands amid a deepening political crisis. Lam, however, stopped short of announcing a fully independent investigation into the crisis, including the police response and use of force \u2014 and many are already rejecting her concessions as too little and too late. \u2026 Her other steps included beefing up Hong Kong\u2019s independent police watchdog, known as the Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC), and ordering it to look into the force\u2019s handling of protests and organized crime-linked attacks against protesters in July. Lam said she would also reach out to the community to start a \u201cdirect dialogue\u201d with people and task experts including academics to independently \u201cexamine and review society\u2019s deep-seated problems and to advise the government on finding solutions.\u201d\n\nThe IPCC is considered independent in name only, as the Washington Post later explains. Protesters believe Lam has stocked it with her loyalists, who are then also beholden to Beijing for their positions. Oddly, the regime also sees the IPCC as insufficient, but for its own reasons. The South China Morning Post, considered a semi-official voice of Beijing, editorialized two weeks ago that the IPCC doesn\u2019t have the authority to conduct the kind of inquiry needed to get to the bottom of the unrest.\n\nOf course, they see the bottom as \u2026 well \u2026\n\nThe IPCC announced on July 2 a proactive fact-finding study, stating, \u201cThe reason for the study is that the IPCC is unlikely to be able to effectively discharge its statutory functions without a complete picture of the public order events, where all stakeholders, the public and the police, have had the opportunity to tell their side of the story.\u201d There was no suggestion in the IPCC\u2019s August 16 announcement extending the scope of its work that the study was to become anything else. The study is, therefore, intended to provide no more than context to the complaints it is asked to monitor. It is not \u2013 and does not pretend to be \u2013 an investigation. An inquiry may compel the attendance and examination of witnesses; the provision of data to the IPCC is voluntary. An inquiry is a judicial proceeding, the IPCC\u2019s work is not. The findings of the study, limited as they will be to the conduct of some members of the police, cannot be relied upon as facts when the history of these tragic weeks comes to be written. Finally, the IPCC will not study allegations of protesters\u2019 criminal conduct, of foreign influence or funding, of the entrapment consequences of using police decoys or of how government\u2019s neglect of duty to govern has placed police lives at risk. These are equally important questions which only an inquiry can satisfactorily answer.\n\nEmphasis mine. Beijing is making it clear that they want prosecutions, not inquiries. Lam is therefore straddling two diametrically opposed positions and trying to find a middle ground where there likely isn\u2019t one to be found.\n\nEven if it\u2019s three months late, though, the formal withdrawal is still a significant concession. It seems doubtful that Lam acted on her own to formally withdraw it; she must have gotten Beijing\u2019s permission to make that concession. Although they have been bristling in the last couple of days about \u201cfinal warnings,\u201d the central government must be worried about global reaction to sending troops into Hong Kong. That\u2019s a major gain for the protesters, even if it\u2019s not overall victory.\n\nWill that be enough? Had Lam just withdrawn it at the beginning, it would have been enough. After everything that\u2019s happened over the last three months, the protesters are likely convinced that this is only a tactical retreat by Lam and Beijing. They must believe that Lam and Xi Jinping are trying to take the world\u2019s eye off Hong Kong and bide their time for another try at the extradition bill. And \u2026 they\u2019re almost certainly correct, which is why Beijing doesn\u2019t want independent inquiries into their motives and tactics.", "description": "Too little, too late?", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/lam-withdraw.png"}
