For that we need David Silva, Kevin de Bruyne, Sergio Aguero, Fernandinho and these type of players.\n\n'With the young, young players, you cannot do it. They can be help for the other ones but if the basis of the team is young, it is not possible.\n\n'Everyone knows my opinion of Phil Foden. He is 19 and plays quite enough minutes. He will play a lot this season and the next seasons. Hopefully he will be patient. I haven't spoken to him about it.'\n\nHe suggested that the demands at City meant he could not play Foden too regularly\n\nWith competition for places so fierce at the Etihad, City currently have 15 players on loan including Patrick Roberts, Tosin Adrabioyo and Lukas Nmecha. They have collected \u00a3130million in transfer fees for other academy youngsters, most notably Jadon Sancho, Brahim Diaz, Bersant Cellina and Angus Gunn.\n\nGuardiola hopes Sunday's game against Wolves is the last with Nicolas Otamendi as his only senior fit central defender.\n\nJohn Stones is expected to return from injury after this month's international break but have conceded only once in their last five matches with Fernandinho filling in at the back.\n\n'What were we going to do, cry and complain,' said Guardiola. 'The important thing is to concede few chances. We did that in our last game against Zagreb but against Everton we were lucky, Ederson saved us.\n\nBut Guardiola added when speaking: 'He will play a lot this season and the next seasons'\n\n'The best way is to defend high up the pitch. If we have to defend a lot of time in our box, then \"Woah\". We are not built specifically for that but in general I am so satisfied. In the last couple of years, we have conceded few goals, few chances.\n\n'For a team with this incredible amount of talented players, not defensive talented players, you see our mentality to defend and fight for each other, the midfield players, the full-backs.'\n\nThe football world looked very different the last time Wolves won at Manchester City in August 1999 when a teenage Robbie Keane scored the only goal.\n\nNot only was the match played at City's old Maine Road ground in the second tier, but Keane left the following month for Premier League Coventry City. Manchester City were never in the hunt because they couldn't afford the \u00a36m fee.", "description": "Pep Guardiola has said the high demands for success at Manchester City mean he can't give Phil Foden and other academy talents more first-team opportunities.", "authors": ["Joe Bernstein For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/23/19344966-0-image-a-23_1570314122174.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
