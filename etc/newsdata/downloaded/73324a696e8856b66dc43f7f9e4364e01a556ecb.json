Expanding career horizons, working more effectively and building confidence are the stand-out drivers for people enrolling in the Master of Business Administration.\n\nHigher salary isn\u2019t a key motivation, coming in at number four as the reason for enrolling in an MBA. But it is certainly a benefit, according to the only domestic survey of MBA programs in Australia.\n\nSalary increases are a side-effect of an MBA rather than the main game. Supplied\n\nThese insights come as the biennial AFR BOSS magazine survey reveals that the top five MBA schools are at The University of Sydney, University of Adelaide, Queensland University of Technology, University of South Australia and Griffith University.\n\nThe top three Executive MBA (EMBA) schools are at The University of Sydney, Queensland University of Technology and AGSM @ UNSW Business School.\n\nThe rankings are calculated using an alumni survey, including feedback on student satisfaction, improvement and value for money, and data provided by the business schools, including accreditations, qualifications of teaching staff, research output and staff with current or recent business experience.\n\nOnly 36 per cent of graduates ranked higher salary as a \u201cvery important\u201d motivation for study. So, many might have been pleasantly surprised to find that higher income was a significant benefit. The average salary increase for executives who completed an MBA between 2016 and 2018 was 28 per cent.\n\nThose who graduated with an MBA from Sydney University are likely to be pulling in 55 per cent higher pay than they were before they did their degree.\n\nThe salary effect is more marked for EMBA graduates, with an average remuneration bump of 44 per cent.", "description": "Broadening career horizons, working more effectively and building confidence are the big drivers in executive education.
