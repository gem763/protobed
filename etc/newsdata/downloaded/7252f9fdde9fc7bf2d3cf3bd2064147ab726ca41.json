Photo: Stella Berkofsky\n\nAngel Olsen\u2019s dream house is the one across the street from her. Sure, the neighborhood she lives in is a Zillow voyeur\u2019s smuttiest fantasy: Bucolic? Check. Historic? Check. High median household income? Check, check, check. But it\u2019s not the exact one she wanted to buy herself when she moved to Asheville, North Carolina, seven years ago. Back then, she hadn\u2019t released 2016\u2019s My Woman \u2014 a bigger, bolder, more widely appreciated assertion of the lo-fi, country-fried rock she\u2019d been known for in smaller circles of music. And she didn\u2019t have the savings that came with that success, but she had plans, and one of them included owning her own place, preferably the grand, beige and baby-blue one she drove past again and again, imagining the life she\u2019d have when she moved in.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big deal,\u201d she says of buying a place. \u201cIt\u2019s so nice to do, as a woman who\u2019s not married, who runs her own business.\u201d But when she had finally saved enough, her dream house wasn\u2019t for sale, so she bought the one across the street. \u201cDreams change,\u201d Olsen says matter-of-factly. As it happens, not getting (or giving) exactly what you want is at her core.\n\nShe greets me with a hug, but not a smile, stepping back to let me into the big brick house. Her home has a sense of hard-earned stillness \u2014 incense burns somewhere, healing crystals hide in corners, and she\u2019s chosen a meditative, massage-therapist soundtrack that somehow manages to seem genuinely mystical through her speakers. I charge in, apologizing loudly for my lateness, disturbing the force field. Even Violet, her large, gray cat, leaps up from her resting place, annoyed.\n\nShe\u2019s only got a few peaceful moments left to enjoy before All Mirrors comes out the first week of October and she\u2019s back out on the road. She\u2019s trying to modulate her energy a bit after the necessary annoyances of the day: back-to-back phone interviews and box loads of portraits of herself that needed to be signed and sent out for album promo. Earlier she went to acupuncture. That didn\u2019t work. Then for a run, which also didn\u2019t work. Now the only thing left to try is nicotine, even though it exacerbates the health issues that have become more prominent for her at 32, like stress-related psoriasis. She runs hot (in the Ayurvedic sense) and has been advised to avoid meat, sugar, spicy foods, and all vices. But fuck it, she really needs a cigarette, she says, leading me through the kitchen.\n\nFor Olsen, home ownership has brought up \u201csome things\u201d around partnership. She\u2019s been figuring it out on all fronts: in her professional life, where she\u2019s a self-identified control freak, but here at home, too. Living alone becomes a dozen micro decisions a day about letting people in: Do you have to explain why the wall of that room is only half painted a burnt orange, or do you just let them behold your shitty wall? Do you offer the better chair, or take the stool you usually sit on when nobody is there to want it? You want to offer apricot brandy a friend gave you, but when you discover that there\u2019s barely enough brandy for one, do you direct them instead toward the jug of iced tea in the fridge?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to imagine when I have a partner one day \u2014 whoever that partner shall be that\u2019s strong enough to be around me. Will I want them in my house? You know, with all my stuff in the places that I like them? With their weird dude shit?\u201d She trails off, contemplating how to tolerate someone who wakes up and gets on Instagram before giving her a kiss on the cheek after she scrambled to clean her house the night before so they could come over. (That happened).\n\nShe chooses two glasses, measures out the last of the apricot brandy precisely, and grabs a green ceramic bowl to use as an ashtray on her way to the porch. While the rest of the East Coast is trending toward fall, Asheville remains, resolutely, in sitting-on-the-porch season. Olsen, in all black, sits on a stool to keep the cigarette smoke from blowing directly into my face. The slight difference in elevation between us makes me feel like a worshipper at the foot of a guru \u2014 the magic-hour light accentuates her witchy, elegant figure, like a celebrity of the 1940s but with weirder hair.\n\nFrom her perch she looks out over the dense and varied greens of the landscape, pointing in the direction of the graveyard where Thomas Wolfe is buried \u2014 she sometimes runs through the cemetery, alone, because she can\u2019t help but get mad at people who run faster than her. She points out the site of the former Highland Hospital, the mental institution where Zelda Fitzgerald, a woman with a lot of feelings people didn\u2019t understand at the time, died in a fire, Olsen narrates with a bit of a morbid sparkle in her eye.\n\nThe only landmark I am truly interested in is seeing the bathroom where Olsen cuts her bangs. I need to know: How does she cut them? Which scissors? How often? She seems amused at my technical questions about her hair, as opposed to her music, but Olsen\u2019s bangs journey relates more to her music than it seems \u2014 inviting the sort of interpretation of her identity that drives her crazy.\n\n\u201cI have a really high forehead and a really high widow\u2019s peak. And I\u2019ve always had bangs because of it,\u201d she says, pushing up her hair to show her hairline. They\u2019ve gone from the long, honey-blond, shy-girl-with-guitar bangs she had in 2011 emerging from Chicago\u2019s DIY scene to the darker, shorter bangs she adopted as she became an avatar for intimate female sadness. For My Woman, she curled them up, embracing a brasher, rockabilly vibe. The current iteration, created by \u201cugly\u201d hairstylist Dylan Chavez, feels impatient (no time for curling irons), spiky, difficult, brutalist, and impossible to categorize. Are they micro bangs or something that hasn\u2019t been named yet? Am I reading too much into her haircut?\n\nShe thinks so, but she\u2019s used to people analyzing everything about her. Olsen\u2019s music is intimate, personal, and at times, emotionally gutting: Unfortunately for her, she\u2019s very good at translating sadness, angst, and loneliness. Her voice can whisper, belt, or lilt in order to get one of those moods across. She\u2019s often compared to Roy Orbison and Patsy Cline. Sometimes Dolly Parton, but she\u2019s suspicious of that. \u201cI\u2019m like, which part? Which part of Dolly Parton reminds you of me? \u2019Cause I don\u2019t see any similarities really,\u201d she says, referring to the fact that she has \u201cDolly Parton\u2019s frame.\u201d\n\nOlsen wants to challenge all of those caricatures \u2014 she even tried her hand at disco this past summer, working with mega-hitmaker Mark Ronson on \u201cTrue Blue,\u201d a track that seemed tuned for the hours after the MDMA has worn off and the typically happy dance track takes a slightly nihilistic turn. When she does pop, it\u2019s with a punch.\n\n\u2014\n\nLater that night we\u2019re at the Mexican restaurant she calls her \u201ccomfort spot.\u201d The menu has about ten different margarita options, but Olsen\u2019s drinking Manhattans. A few people stop to congratulate her on the recent video for \u201cLark,\u201d a single from the new album. She denies that she\u2019s the mayor of Asheville \u2014 the small-town nosiness can drive her crazy sometimes, she says, mimicking the bank teller who asked her, suspiciously, \u201cwhat she did for a living\u201d the last time she deposited her all-cash tour earnings. She has a small group of friends who \u201cdon\u2019t care too much about her music,\u201d though they support her \u2014 they\u2019re the people who will watch her house and feed her cat while she\u2019s out on tour in exchange for wine.\n\nAll Mirrors closes a chapter for her, she explains. She\u2019s been confronting a lot: a breakup that felt like a divorce, a tour that pushed her to exhaustion and beyond. She struggled to realize that her band and crew rely on her for their livelihood and her leadership. Olsen\u2019s parents are in their 80s \u2014 she was adopted into a family with eight siblings, many of whom were already grown up and moved away \u2014 and suddenly, she\u2019s confronted with helping them make more decisions. It\u2019s been a lot, to say the least.\n\n\u201cPeople think its a breakup album, but it\u2019s really an album about changing,\u201d she says of All Mirrors. If all you know of Angel Olsen is the sparse and weepy stuff, or if your familiarity begins and ends at the cheeky and brash \u201cShut Up, Kiss Me,\u201d All Mirrors will be a bit of a shock. She\u2019s not just singing through her issues, she\u2019s expanding the music to reckon with the totality of them, in order to move forward. Songs like \u201cLark,\u201d about the verbal abuse she\u2019s suffered in relationships, is so dark and dense, you\u2019ll hear it and think, \u201cIs that a song, or is that, like, anger?\u201d she says.\n\nBut the process has required her to enlist help. She\u2019s been collaborating more, playing with a bigger band, and co-orchestrating to create different, lusher versions of songs she originally wrote as spare, bare-bones solo performances. \u201cI am so fucking stubborn, and it sucks,\u201d she says. But she\u2019s learning. Sometimes she even lets someone else have the final say.\n\nPerhaps inspired by the discussions of collaboration and compromise, or by the second drink, she can\u2019t help but bring the conversation back to where we began \u2014 her house. Suddenly we\u2019re turning into a clich\u00e9: two buzzed women discussing what it means to be single. \u201cWhen you spend enough time alone, you can learn to like things and notice the small details in life that you would otherwise be too preoccupied to see,\u201d she says, considering different kinds of partnership.\n\nAt one point, she was certain she wanted to live alone with cats. And then she was certain she wanted to be home with kids and stop playing music. \u201cAnd then it was like \u2026 what if I\u2019m gay \u2026 no, I\u2019m not gay \u2026 maybe I just hate men \u2026 or I need to get married soon and have kids \u2026 or I don\u2019t know if marriage is in the cards and if I have a kid maybe I\u2019ll just have it by myself?\u201d\n\nI nod along to this monologue I\u2019ve had with myself before. I feel a flash of recognition, the same way I recognize my own feelings in her music, which I tell her. She pulls out her phone to play me a song. When the 30-something women I know need confirmation of their feelings and thoughts, many listen to Olsen\u2019s music \u2014 when Olsen needs it, she listens to Mildred Bailey. She cues up a cover of \u201cIt\u2019s a Woman\u2019s Prerogative.\u201d We listen together, pressing our ears to the tiny speaker:\n\nI don\u2019t know who it was that wrote it,\n\nor by whose pen it was signed.\n\nSomeone once said, and I quote it,\n\nIt\u2019s a woman\u2019s prerogative to change her mind.\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d Olsen nudges me. \u201cThat is the best lyric!\u201d And she warbles along before we say good-bye for the night.\n\nPrada dress, $7,510, and boots, price upon request, at select Prada boutiques.
