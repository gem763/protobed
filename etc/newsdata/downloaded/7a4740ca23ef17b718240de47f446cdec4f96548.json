Here\u2019s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.\n\nWe begin with a \u201csurprise\u201d for CCCubbon, who has become \u201cquite addicted\u201d to The House on the Strand by Daphne du Maurier:\n\nAt first I was scoffing mentally at the notion that a drug could induce time travel to the 14th century but the story has drawn me in and I find myself addicted to the addiction of Richard who cannot resist returning again and again, getting irritated by his wife\u2019s presence, caught between two worlds. It is noteworthy the way du Maurier tells of how the landscape changes over the centuries, how Richard searches to marry up the places of then and his time \u2013 and yes, there is a map.\n\n\u201cJust finished Leonard and Hungry Paul by Ronan Hession,\u201d says pinstripedflower, and \u201cloved it\u201d:\n\nIt\u2019s a rather gentle tale of two friends who haven\u2019t quite fully embraced life, and how they get on without being \u2018complete\u2019. I have to say I probably most resonated with Hungry Paul\u2019s takedown of his sister Grace on her need for \u2018busyness\u2019 and it made me think about my always being rushing around! Would recommend for anyone looking for a nice, uncomplicated but well-written novel.\n\nJudith Kerr\u2019s Bombs On Aunt Dainty has impressed MarGar65 :\n\nKerr was a wonderful writer. She had such a clear voice when she wrote! The artist\u2019s eye is there and she doesn\u2019t lose the perspective of the young girl even as she writes as an older, more mature, more experienced woman.\n\nTim O\u2019Brien\u2019s magnificent The Things They Carried has worked its dark magic on Larts:\n\nI thought it was frightening, awesome, touching, shocking. It\u2019s a well-written book - is it fiction? Memoir? Well he keeps telling you that it\u2019s often made up but then tells you that it\u2019s true. None of that bothered me particularly. The whole thing struck me as authentic and honest. Wonderful, if difficult, read.\n\nInvisible Women by Caroline Criado-Perez has been convincing for daveportivo:\n\nI thought it was a fascinating read and a powerful argument for collecting sex-disaggregated data. I knew much of it already, but the medical research chapter was particularly disturbing. I\u2019d read about the effects of the \u201caverage human\u201d in terms of pollution before (there are some tragic stories), but hadn\u2019t really considered the implications of that concept (or a lack of rigorous, multi-phase testing on women) in terms of basic medicine and diagnosis ... But in many ways that proves her point, even when I was aware of a problem in the way we measured something, I didn\u2019t think: \u201cHang on, I wonder if they are doing this in other areas\u201d.\n\nJayZed has been making good progress through Proust\u2019s In Search of Lost Time:\n\nI finished In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower last week (Penguin translation by James Grieve). I mentioned before that there were parts of Swann\u2019s Way that I found a bit of a slog (and other parts that I loved). About half-way through volume two, however - on the way to Balbec - I suddenly got it. I understand now why people become immersed in and obsessed with Proust, and I\u2019m looking forward to the rest of it.\n\n\u201cJames Meek\u2019s To Calais, In Ordinary Time is easily my new novel of 2019,\u201d writes allworthy:\n\nA group of archers are making for Calais when the Plague hits. It\u2019s 1348. The novel is written in three styles or registers from people of different stations. It\u2019s not quite as wide as The Canterbury Tales but you get a good mix and Meek deftly inserts strong women into the story. It\u2019s real achievement is the language. The book is easy to read but contains many words, phrases and cadences which feel right for the period and which gives the book great energy and a realism. The characters are complex, even the minor ones. They are often wrestling with an upside down world that they struggle to understand. It\u2019s not all doom and gloom either. Some of it is very funny but a moving, well-paced novel that never slacks. Really recommended.\n\nFinally, interwar has been reading The Red House Mystery by AA Milne:\n\nA thoroughly silly plot, characters all sound the same (except the comically rendered servants), dead guy lying there and everyone standing around coolly discussing the pros and cons of whether their country-house host did it. Yes, it\u2019s just what the doctor ordered (or should have)! Puts the brain on hold for an hour or two, escaping far from Brexit.\n\nSounds like a useful one!\n\nInteresting links about books and reading\n\n\u201cHe can remember the name of a girl he touched up in Uruguay in 1918.\u201d Arthur Rubinstein has impressed Elton John.\n\n\u201cBut, I say again, why not?\u201d Erica Wagner on the Booker prize\u2019s decision to award two authors this year.\n\nClassic Bloom.\n\n\u201cArguing about Susan Sontag is one of the things that keeps her alive for us, as a figure of contention,\u201d says James Wolcott.\n\nIf you\u2019re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #GuardianBooks, and we\u2019ll include a selection in this blog.
