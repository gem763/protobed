Now, he can officially claim to be both a member of and contributor to the \u201cSourtoe Cocktail Club.\u201d\n\nGriffiths, who lost three toes to frostbite two winters ago, had donated his amputated big toe to the Downtown Hotel in Dawson City, Yukon Territory -- home of the creepy cocktail which consists of a shot of whiskey with a mummified human toe in it.\n\nObviously, people aren\u2019t supposed to drink the toe itself, but instead \"kiss it\" by taking the shot and letting the toe touch their lips. However, the bar apparently has a problem with toes disappearing. So, when Griffiths\u2019 toe was donated, it was a big deal, especially when he agreed to take a shot garnished with his own toe.\n\nIRISH PUB POURS CONOR MCGREGOR'S WHISKEY DOWN TOILET, CALLS HIS BEHAVIOR 'DISGUSTING'\n\n\u201cYes, we had a large crowd come out, including the local radio station doing a live-on-location broadcast to watch Nick Griffiths down the Sourtoe Cocktail with his own toe,\u201d a representative for the hotel told Fox News.\n\n\u201cThere was lots of cheering and applause with a number of the patrons excited to be among the first to do the shot with the new big toe,\u201d the rep added. \u201cEveryone wanted their picture taken with Nick and he autographed their Sourtoe Cocktail certificates. He was very accommodating and friendly with them.\u201d\n\nThe hotel\u2019s resident \u201ctoemaster,\u201d Terry Lee, was reportedly \u201cdelighted about the whole thing and how well everything went.\u201d\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\n\u201cWe will certainly be adding a picture of Nick to our Sourtoe Wall of Fame in the bar,\u201d the rep confirmed. \u201cAnd yes, we are always on the lookout for new toes and welcome any toe-nations!\u201d\n\nGriffiths, of Greater Manchester, England, had the toes amputated due to frostbite while competing in the Yukon Arctic Ultra Race. As he was being treated at a local hospital, the former Royal Marine remembered a strange advertisement he saw just before the race.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cIt said: \u2018Had frostbite? We want your toes,\u2019\u201d Griffiths told The Guardian. \u201cI thought it was a bit of a joke, really.\u201d\n\nBut the ad was very real, as the Downtown Hotel is always on the lookout for frostbitten toes to garnish their signature drink. The hotel\u2019s bar has been serving up the drink since 1973.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAnd according to the bar\u2019s rules, anyone who orders is tasked with touching the toe to their lips in order to join the \u201cSourtoe Cocktail Club.\u201d Customers are told, \u201cYou can drink it fast, you can drink it slow, but your lips must touch the toe.\u201d Over 90,000 brave souls have completed the challenge to earn a certificate of completion, the New York Post reports.\n\nFox News' Janine Puhak contributed to this report.", "description": "A man who promised to drink his amputated toe has made good on his promise.", "authors": ["Michael Hollan"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/sourtoe-cocktail.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
