REUTERS/Albert Gea/File Photo\n\nThe document, seen by Reuters, was prepared by the Finnish presidency of the EU ahead of a meeting of the bloc\u2019s finance ministers on Saturday in Helsinki, which will discuss the matter.\n\nEU rules on energy taxation have not changed for more than 15 years and they appear \u201coutdated and poorly adapted to climate change challenges and developments in energy policy at EU level,\u201d the document says.\n\nIn the last decade, EU countries have led the global shift towards renewable energy and set up the world\u2019s largest emissions trading system to price carbon and reduce reliance on more polluting fuels.\n\nBut their taxes have not reflected these changes, as existing taxation \u201cdoes not differentiate between renewable and carbon-intensive sources of electricity,\u201d the document says.\n\nThe confidential paper, which is not binding on EU authorities, urges a review of minimum tax rates for energy products, which currently differ among EU states and do not reward sources of energy for their efficiency.\n\n\u201cThe minimum rates for electricity and heating fuels, for example, are too low to give an adequate price signal to energy users,\u201d discouraging investment in energy efficiency, the document says.\n\nIt also calls for an end to energy tax exemptions granted to the aviation and maritime transport sectors in the EU, as they are \u201cnot in line with the decarbonization objectives of the Union\u2019s transport policies.\u201d\n\nBy increasing taxes on more polluting energy products, the EU could more effectively contribute to the fight against climate change, supporters of the plan say.\n\nAmbitious targets for reducing carbon emissions by at least 50% by 2030 are part of the agenda of the new European Commission which will take office in November.\n\nHowever, opposition from some of the 28 EU states has in the past blocked energy tax reforms.\n\nA plan from the EU executive to revise energy taxes was struck down in 2015, as eastern European states who rely on cheaper carbon fuel feared higher costs and Western countries were keen to protect some of their transport industries against global competition.\n\nOpposition to changing the existing rules, which date back to 2003, is likely to remain strong, but the Commission\u2019s president-designate Ursula von der Leyen has promised big changes and is expected to invest much of her political capital on the reform.\n\n\u201cIt has been repeated time and again that we need to tax resource use more and labor less. It\u2019s time to do it. We hope that the future review of the energy tax directive will support this objective,\u201d said Johan Barros, Tax Policy Manager at Accountancy Europe, a trade association.\n\nEU tax overhauls are made more difficult by provisions that require unanimous support from all member states to carry them out. Von der Leyen has called for ending these provisions and a decision by majority.\n\nA confidential work program prepared by Commission officials before von der Leyen\u2019s appointment in July envisages legislative proposals to end tax exemptions for air and sea transport by early 2020, and the review of minimum tax rates for energy products by the end of next year.\n\nIn both cases, the overhauls should be decided by majority, the document said.", "description": "The European Union is studying a reform of energy taxes to align them with climate targets, an EU document showed, listing as possible measures higher minimum tax rates, fossil fuel levies and the end of waivers for the air and sea transport sectors.", "authors": ["Francesco Guarascio", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427995981&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF881DU", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
