Find out our favourites below.\n\nA flat-rate credit card can be good if you don't want to fall into the trap of disappearing introductory rates\n\nInterest-free purchase and balance transfer credit cards have long stolen the spotlight.\n\nSuch offers can be huge money-savers if you manage them sensibly, but they are also laden with traps that can easily catch borrowers out if they don't pay attention.\n\nFor some therefore a no-frills credit card low APR credit card might be a better option, avoiding teaser-rates by charging a consistently low interest rate.\n\nMost standard credit cards set interest charges between 19 and 25 per cent per cent APR, while a low-rate card now typically offers a rate between 10 and 15 per cent.\n\nRemember, although these cards charge lower rates, interest can still quickly mount up, so the number one rule should still be to clear your balance as soon as possible.\n\nIf you are considering getting one, here is This is Money's pick of the best available.\n\nThey all come with an APR of 9.9 per cent, however some also come with added perks such a rewards for spending, fee-free overseas spending or cheap balance transfers.\n\nBefore you dive straight in though, don't forget that while the advertised APR may look enticing, it is only offered to 51 per cent of successful applicants.\n\nYou will need a spotless credit rating to get the best deal, if not you may be offered a more expensive APR or be rejected completely.\n\nNatwest\n\nThere are now no credit cards on the market offering an interest rate on purchases lower than 9.9 per cent, however Natwest offers a slightly lower rate on balance transfers than the rest at 6.9 per cent.\n\nAnother bonus, the bank won't charge you the typical 3 per cent handling fee to shift existing debt to the card.\n\nSwipe your card in shops and the interest is slightly higher at 9.9 per cent, but that's still the cheapest deal out there, plus it also offers fee-free spending abroad.\n\nWatch out though, if you use the card to withdraw cash it will cost you. The bank charges a 3 per cent cash withdrawal fee.\n\nOverseas fees: 0 per cent\n\nCash withdrawals: 3 per cent.\n\nThe advertised rate of 9.9 APR per cent won't be offered to all, you might be charged a higher rate of 15.9 or 18.9 APR per cent.\n\nGo on an adventure: You can swap Membership Rewards points for Avios\n\nAmerican Express\n\nThe American Express' Rewards Low Rate Credit Card used to be one of the more expensive low-rate cards, but since other deals have been cut it now sits in poll position.\n\nIt has been one of our favourites for a while however because It has a dual benefit of a low rate plus rewards on your spending.\n\nIt charges 9.9 per cent interest, plus you earn Membership Rewards points which can be used to pay off your balance, swapped for airline rewards (1 Membership Rewards is worth 1 Avios), or exchanged for gift cards with a range of retailers.\n\nYou earn 1 Membership Rewards point for every \u00a31 you spend\n\nAmex is currently offering you 2,500 bonus Membership Rewards points when you spend \u00a31,000 in your first three months.\n\nWatch out:\n\nRemember as we mentioned above rewards points are designed to encourage you to spend.\n\nWhile the card comes with a low interest rate, to make the most of them you should try to clear your balance each month to avoid interest altogether.\n\nOtherwise the charges will quickly eat away at the value of any rewards you have earned.\n\nOverseas fees: 2.99 per cent.\n\nCash withdrawals: 3 per cent - minimum \u00a33.\n\nB\n\nDigital challenger, B, has a credit card with a lower than average interest rate of 9.9 per cent.\n\nThe off-shoot of Clydesdale and Yorkshire Banks also offers no foreign transaction fees, meaning spending abroad is free.\n\nBut you will be charged for making ATM withdrawals.\n\nThis will cost you 3 per cent of the amount you withdraw, with a minimum of \u00a33. Remember when you do this, interest is applied instantly, and at a much higher interest of 27.9 per cent, so you will want to make sure to clear your balance as soon as possible.\n\nIt won't charge for transferring an existing balance from another credit card, but unlike Lloyds below, this isn't just limited to the first 60 or 90 days after opening the card.\n\nThe bank's app also offers real-time insights on your spending, plus it lets you tag transactions and set up budgets in much the same way as popular start-up banks Monzo and Starling.\n\nOverseas fees: 0 per cent\n\nCash withdrawals: 3 per cent.\n\nLloyds Bank\n\nLloyds Bank charges a rate of 9.94 per cent on purchases and balance transfers, with an overall APR of 9.9 per cent.\n\nIt is one of the lowest and again it charges no extra fees to move debt from an existing credit card.\n\nIt comes with no handing fees on balance transfers if you shift debt to the card within the first 90 days. After that you will be charged 3 per cent.\n\nAgain only those with the best credit scores will qualify for the low rate. Those without a strong score may be rejected.\n\nAnd, as many as 49 per cent of successful applicants may be offered a higher rate of 14.9 per cent, depending on their circumstances.\n\nOverseas fees: 2.95 per cent transaction fee.\n\nCash withdrawals: 3 per cent.", "description": "There are a lot of credit cards on the market offering eye-catching 0 per cent interest deals but such teaser rates disappear fast so why not consider a continuously low-rate card instead?", "authors": ["Emma Gunn For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
