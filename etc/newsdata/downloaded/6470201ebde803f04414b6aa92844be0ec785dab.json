Cole Bennetts\n\nYasmin Allen, a director of ASX, Cochlear and Santos, says the challenge is to push enough work to committees to enable boards to \u201clift our heads up and think long term\u201d.\n\nZlatko Todorcevski, a director at cement maker Adelaide Brighton, casino operator Star Entertainment and Coles, reveals that several of his boards add three days to their annual board meetings to \u201cfocus on strategy with nothing else\u201d.\n\nLivingstone puts the macro economy and geopolitical threats at the top of her list of issues, followed by product innovation, culture, remuneration and cyber security.\n\nWoodside\u2019s Goyder puts climate change on his agenda, along with community issues such as \u201ctrue\u201d Indigenous reconciliation, as well as investing in the communities where Woodside operates.\n\nReturns are the 'foundation block'\n\nHowever, the former Wesfarmers CEO says those challenges need to be built on the \u201cfoundation block of generating sustainable returns so that people can be employed, taxes paid, and all stakeholders [shareholders, employees, suppliers, community, environment] benefit\u201d.\n\nLendlease chairman Michael Ullmer\u2019s main issues are energy, regulators and a lack of productivity improvements, and he says much of the blame lies with government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe cost of energy is challenging the viability of a number of business models,\u201d he says. He also warns about a contradiction in the government\u2019s rhetoric that business should get out and invest while its default option is to encourage regulators to litigate.\n\n\u201cChoices on where to invest capital will be impacted by the uncertainty in policy and regulatory frameworks.\u201d\n\nAnother of his top concerns is the lack of progress on the productivity agenda for more than a decade.\n\n'This is one of the most challenging issues'\n\nMany top directors nominated culture as an issue of growing importance, with the main concern being how to find the best way to measure it.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the most challenging issues facing boards today,\u201d says Australia Post, Woolworths and Abacus Property director Holly Kramer. \u201cWe need to find better ways to monitor organisational culture other than by relying on the outdated employee engagement surveys.\u201d\n\nCommonwealth Bank director Catherine Livingstone warns the best HR policies in the world become meaningless if they are not followed in practice. Edwina Pickles\n\nUllmer agrees: \u201cMake sure that culture is a core topic on the board agenda, and establish ways to regularly measure it.\u201d\n\nCarnival Australia chairman Ann Sherry says: \u201cCulture measures are weak and varied [and] investors discount as a result. Organisations pick and choose. [There] needs to be greater discipline about measurement and then accountability.\u201d\n\nLivingstone, who has kept a low profile over the past 12 months, says boards need to distinguish between the infrastructure side of culture (policies, processes and systems) and its human side (the lived experience of the traditions, beliefs and symbols that characterise the organisation).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is the interaction between these two dimensions which determines the overall culture of an organisation.\u201d\n\nLivingstone, who was at the centre of the maelstrom from the Hayne royal commission, warns the best HR policies in the world become meaningless if they are not followed in practice.\n\n\u201cA strong human side of culture can be undermined by policies, processes and systems which are not fit for purpose and which therefore undermine the ability of employees to get their job done without, for example, resorting to workarounds,\u201d she says. \u201cThese workarounds can have unintended risk consequences, and hence a perception of poor culture.\u201d\n\n'We have lost our way a bit' on pay\n\nExecutive pay remains deeply divisive for boards, and confusion reigns over how it can be simplified. The debate intensified following the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority\u2019s (APRA) push to make bank pay based on 50 per cent non-financial risks, which is controversial with investors.\n\n\u201cI think we have lost our way a bit on executive remuneration,\u201d Goyder says. \u201cThe time taken by boards and remuneration committees on executive remuneration is out of whack with its importance.\u201d\n\nGoyder says the quality of management, employees and the board, the balance sheet, cash generation, and capacity to take opportunities and withstand shocks should be the key drivers for investors and stakeholders. \u201cI hope that we eventually get to more simplified remuneration models, with base salary and equity earned over time the key components.\u201d\n\nOthers agree the answer is more simplified base pay and long-term incentives, which are better aligned to investors. Newcrest Mining chairman Peter Hay suggests \u201can incremental change towards long-term, equity-based rem\u201d, as does Ansell\u2019s Glenn Barnes, who says: \u201cDrop short-term incentives and move to salary package plus long-term options.\u201d\n\nMaxsted also suggests replacing long-term incentive schemes with share rights, \u201cwhich provide a much better alignment between shareholder and executive\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSafe Work Australia chairman and Wesfarmers and AGL director Diane Smith-Gander says ultimately it is as simple as boards having \u201cmore courage to reduce absolute remuneration levels\u201d.\n\n'You can\u2019t take a punt on people'\n\nBoards are looking at themselves more closely than ever, as they have come under heavy fire following the Hayne royal commission and the APRA report into CBA, which warned that the bank board had a \u201clight hand on the tiller\u201d.\n\nAs boards dive deeper into management, they are also grappling with how much they should wade into \"social activism\" amid growing criticism of the so-called directors\u2019 club and the push for greater gender and cultural diversity.\n\nMaxsted firmly believes a lot of the issues come back to an expectation gap about the role of boards, and says that while watching the ousting of NAB chairman Ken Henry, he experienced \u201can element of there but for the grace of God\u201d.\n\n\u201cA lot of people are confusing the role of board member versus management, either mischievously or because they don\u2019t understand,\u201d the former KPMG accountant says, likening the public\u2019s expectation gap to the role of auditors. \u201cWhen there are issues as evidenced by Hayne, the immediate focus goes straight to the board. What was the board doing? Was the board asleep? Why wasn\u2019t it thinking about this?\u201d\n\nThe obligation is very clear in the law. My primary bligation is to the shareholders. \u2014 Lindsay Maxsted, Westpac chairman\n\nMaxsted has some sympathy for Gerry Harvey and David Murray, who believe there is too much focus on diversity, although he agrees they are at the \u201cextreme\u201d end of the debate.\n\n\u201cQuite clearly, the principal job of the board is to plenish yourself with the right skill set \u2026 part of the way in which the board will work best is if there is diversity on the board, so the two aren\u2019t against each other. Gerry is right that, at the end of the day, you\u2019ve got to get the right people who understand the business and can make a really strong contribution.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaxsted, to an extent, also defends the directors\u2019 club. \u201cIt\u2019s like everything: if you want the best people in terms of their qualifications, part of their qualifications will be experience doing something. These are really important jobs and you can\u2019t take a punt on people from different backgrounds who haven\u2019t had experience sitting around a board table all the time \u2026 I\u2019ve got people on my Westpac and Transurban boards where it\u2019s their first board appointment, but you can\u2019t have too many of them.\u201d\n\nMaxsted also has a conventional take on directors\u2019 duties, amid continued debate about whether boards could be made to consider social and environmental concerns.\n\n\u201cThe obligation is very clear in the law,\u201d he says. \u201cMy primary obligation is to the shareholders,\u201d which he says allows some flexibility to consider customers and broader stakeholders.\n\nThe wild card in the debate among directors is a changing of the guard, as shown by the BOSS analysis. This is partly being driven by the normal fluctuations of the market, but also by a younger set of chairmen and directors taking power.\n\nWhile Maxsted remains on top of the power ranking, and a clutch of female directors have climbed this year, others such as AMP directors David Murray, John O\u2019Sullivan, John Fraser and Peter Varghese have dropped since 2017 as the financial sector, and AMP in particular, waned.\n\nANZ directors including chairman David Gonski, Jane Halton (also on Crown), Paula Dwyer, John Key, Ilana Atlas, Graeme Liebelt and John Macfarlane also fell down the list as bank stocks suffered.\n\nThere is also a cohort of younger chairmen and directors stepping into key roles. Those include MacKenzie at BHP, Goyder at Woodside, Atlas at Coca-Cola Amatil, Tim Poole at Aurizon Holdings and Simon Thompson at Rio Tinto.\n\nA recent survey of top-50 CEOs found their average age has fallen to 54, signalling a shift from the Baby Boomers to Generation X.\n\nLong-time director Rebecca McGrath says this changing of the guard \u201cimplies a change in attitude, style and behaviour\u201d, and perhaps signals a greater emphasis on social and environmental issues such as diversity, inclusion, climate change and workplace culture.", "description": "Lindsay Maxsted, the chairman of Westpac and roads operator Transurban has again topped the AFR BOSS magazine list of most powerful directors.
