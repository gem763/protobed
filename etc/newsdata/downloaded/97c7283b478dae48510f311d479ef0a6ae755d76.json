However, he put his own spin on the powder blue suit by leaving the buttons on his jacket undone to serve chest. Jay Z could never.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the caption, CiCi praised her pals and said: \u2018From the Wilsons to the Carters to the Obamas\u2026 Much Love & Respect. We goin Ape $#!% #HappyHalloween.\u2019\n\nReacting to the accuracy of their Halloween looks, one fan commented: \u2018Nailed it,\u2019 while another said: \u2018YAAAASSSSS YALL DID THAT [sic].\u2019\n\nOne fan cheered: \u2018Omg Russell took me out with the hair though\u2026they ate this look,\u2019 and another laughed: \u2018Lmaooo Russell face is my MOOD tuhhhh day [sic].\u2019\n\n\u2018NAILED IT\u203c\ufe0f\u203c\ufe0f Imitation is the greatest form,\u2019 another said.\n\nTaken aback by Bey and Jay\u2019s doppelgangers, one admitted: \u2018I was so confused for 3 seconds lol.\u2019\n\nCiara and Russell aren\u2019t the only ones in the family slaying their Halloween looks, as their children Future, five, and Sienna, two, took it to the next level.\n\nThe siblings went as The Jackson 5 (but two) and wore the cutest, matching pink outfits complete with feathers and bold prints. They even delivered a little performance to ABC and, yep, our hearts melted.\n\nWe\u2019re yet to see Beyonce and Jay Z\u2019s Halloween looks this year but if they went as CiCi and Russ, we\u2019d definitely be spooked.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
