Police said the driver sped away.\n\nA police spokesman said the vehicle struck a curb and became disabled along Morris Road, about one-third of a mile away. Police said the man exited the vehicle and fired at least twice at officers. At least one officer returned fire, police said.\n\nThe man ran into the woods and was tracked down a short time later, police said. John Raymond Hudson, 31, of Southeast, was charged with assault on a police officer while armed, assault with a dangerous weapon, carrying a pistol without a license and possession of a large-capacity gun magazine.\n\nPolice said they recovered a firearm with an extended magazine and a laser scope. Dustin Sternbeck, a police spokesman, said the officers\u2019 body cameras were activated and the incident is under internal investigation.\n\nWednesday\u2019s shooting on Morris Road marks at least the fourth time D.C. police officers have fired their weapons at a person this year, according to the department. Three of those instances occurred in the past week.\n\nOn Monday police fatally shot a man who they said had killed his brother inside an apartment and then fired on officers outside the complex on Savannah Terrace SE, striking an officer in the chest. That officer was saved by his protective vest.\n\nAuthorities said that on Thursday, police shot and wounded a man at 51st and F streets in Southeast. The department said officers responding to a call confronted a man who shot at them. Officers fired back, wounding the 32-year-old suspected gunman, who is facing charges. No officers were struck.\n\nAnd on June 23, police shot a man during a traffic stop on Alabama Avenue in Southeast after finding a gun magazine on the driver\u2019s lap. Police said they shot him after he moved his hands to his waistband.\n\nThe wounded man drove off but later checked into a hospital. Police said they recovered the vehicle and found a loaded 9mm handgun between the driver\u2019s seat and the center console. The man was not seriously wounded.\n\nIn a separate incident, police said a gunman fired on a uniformed officer July 4 on Hillside Road in Southeast. No one was wounded in that incident. No arrest has been made; police released a video of the shooting.\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "No one was injured in gun battle on Morris Road.", "authors": ["Dana Hedgpeth", "Reporter Covering Local Breaking News", "Peter Hermann", "Reporter Covering Crime", "Specifically The D.C.
