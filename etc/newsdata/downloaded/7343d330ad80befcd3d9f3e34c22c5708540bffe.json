(Let\u2019s hope that the police don\u2019t because they\u2019ll probably arrest them).\n\nWe do, however, know the identity of at least one of the tofu-munching gimps who thought it would be a good idea to stop thousands of commuters getting to work that morning by preventing their transport from leaving the station.\n\nHis name is Mark Ovland and he\u2019s a Buddhist teacher.\n\nNo, wait, scrub that. He\u2019s even more useless than that. Mark Ovland is an ex-Buddhist teacher.\n\nOvland used to have a non-job.\n\nNow he has given up even his non-job to become a full time climate protestor, which isn\u2019t so much of a non-job as an anti-job: it doesn\u2019t merely fail to add much to the economy, like his Buddhist teaching non-job did; it actively steals from the economy by preventing people from earning a living and creating value and trying to give their kids a better future.\n\nBut what does any of this have to do with Brexit?\n\nIt has EVERYTHING to do with Brexit.\n\nThe clash between hard-working, honest, decent wage-earners on the one hand, and work-shy, pampered, over-\u201ceducated\u201d, lefty eco-activist parasites on the other is the embodiment of the clash of cultures which led to Brexit.\n\nIf you had to draw a Venn diagram of Extinction Rebellion supporters and people who voted Remain, you wouldn\u2019t get two overlapping circles \u2014 you\u2019d get one circle with both pretty much sitting on top of each other.\n\nExtinction Rebellion is Remain; Remain is Extinction Rebellion.\n\nThat\u2019s because Remain was never really about Britain\u2019s membership of the European Union any more than Extinction Rebellion is really about saving the planet.\n\nWhat they\u2019re both really about is an attitude, a state of mind, which is best summed up by a brilliant article I urge you to read by Russell Taylor called \u2018The Real Origins of Brexit\u2019.\n\nIn his long-read diatribe, Taylor describes the rise and rise of the class I sometimes describe \u2014 borrowing from ST Coleridge \u2014 as \u2018the clerisy.\u2019\n\nThe clerisy is that entitled, educated, middle-class liberal elite which has become increasingly dominant in Britain and elsewhere \u2014 the U.S., for example, suffers exactly same problem \u2014 since the turn of the Millennium.\n\nThis liberal elite is at once a parasite and an oppressor. Not only does it feel that it is owed a generous living, regardless of what it actually contributes to the economy. But it also believes that by dint of its education it has the right to tell the rest of the population how it should behave, talk, even think.\n\nOne of the things that these liberal elites have in common across the West is their passionate belief in bigger government.\n\nThey have to believe in bigger government because their livings often depend on it.\n\nHere\u2019s Taylor describing how it works:\n\nWhereas blue collar trades were increasingly seen as gauche and retrograde, professions that utilised certified planners and pontificators assumed an air of sophistication. Before long, even businesses were overloaded with backroom meddlers cooking up problems to solve, enforcing government regulations and mimicking its paternalistic attitudes. The country was soon awash with ambitious mediocrities, enforcing compliance, ensuring diversity, drawing up guidelines, and doing other such \u2018work\u2019 that added sweet F.A. to the bottom line. The creative sector benefited, too, from the notion that the brightest and the best shouldn\u2019t be subject to the vagaries of the free market or the vulgarity of popular demand. If an artist considered his work worthy of an audience, then funding would be provided whether that audience existed or not. It was a similar story for experts in any field ostensibly concerned with the disadvantaged. Money and power would be transferred their way, without the consent of the paying public.\n\nExtinction Rebellion, though it professes to be anti-Establishment, embodies the left-liberal values of the current Establishment hegemony.\n\nThat\u2019s why rarely, if ever, will you hear anyone in government criticising Extinction Rebellion\u2019s ideology, only its methods.\n\nThen again, as one Conservative Brexiteer once told me, you can only fight a war on so many fronts. \u201cOf course I know the whole climate change thing is bollocks,\u201d he said \u2013 or words to that effect. \u201cBut I can only marshal my forces for one major battle at a time and that battle right now is Brexit.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s how politicians have to think, it\u2019s the nature of politics. Even the great Donald Trump has to play by these rules: look, for example, at how he has chickened out of having a red-team/blue-team scientific debate on global warming.\n\nHappily, though, ordinary people are not constrained by such rules. There comes a point where they simply say to themselves:\n\n\u201cSod this for a game of soldiers. I really don\u2019t care whether what I\u2019m about to do is wise or expedient or even legal, come to that. I\u2019m just sick to the back teeth of what\u2019s happening to my country. It\u2019s wrong. It feels wrong. And if the system that is supposed to look after the interests of decent, law-abiding, productive citizens will no long protect the interests of decent, law-abiding, productive citizens then I guess I\u2019ll have to take the law into my own hands.\u201d\n\nWhich is exactly what happened at Canning Town Station in the East of London this week.\n\nFor months, on and off, Extinction Rebellion activists have been playing havoc with the lives of ordinary people who thought the law was supposed to protect them and their livelihoods from the kind of direct action that Extinction Rebellion and its apologists keep reassuring us is peaceful and in our best interests.\n\nGrudging tolerance has gradually given way to a simmering sense of injustice: \u201cHow can it be\u201d, ordinary folk have started to wonder, \u201cthat these privileged wanktards with their pointless degrees in Environmental Sciences and Advanced Poi are free to build pyramids at Oxford Circus and block Westminster Bridge when if I tried it I\u2019d get myself chucked in jail?\u201d\n\nThat simmering sense of injustice is now erupting into acts of rebellion \u2014 real rebellion, not Extinction Rebellion\u2019s state-protected faux-rebellion \u2014 like the one in Canning Town Station.\n\nSomething very similar is happening with people\u2019s feelings about Brexit: \u201cHow can it be right that we live in democracy which refuses to honour a popular vote? Surely honouring a popular vote is the most basic requirement. And if it doesn\u2019t do that, then democracy has failed and we need to start looking at other ways of making our feelings known.\u201d\n\nMy take home from all this isn\u2019t that it\u2019s all about to kick off and that Britain is about to erupt in gilets-jaunes type violence.\n\nRather, it\u2019s simply that the longer Brexit has been delayed by the corrupt, failing Establishment, the more we Brexiteers have become aware that we are the majority, that we\u2019re the ones with both justice and common sense on our side, and that we\u2019re not going to take no for an answer.\n\nThe liberal-left Establishment, of course, would love to spin it differently.\n\nI thought it was hilarious, for example, the way the liberal-left media tried to pretend that the Canning Town incident was somehow a \u201cshocking\u201d act of violence:\n\nShocking moment angry commuters drag two #ExtinctionRebellion protestors off the top of a train in Canning Town and attack them. pic.twitter.com/EZAMa9tT2t \u2014 Mahatir Pasha (@mahatir_pasha) October 17, 2019\n\nBut this kind of spin is all they have left in their depleted armoury.\n\nI\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again, whatever nonsense the Remain Establishment has got planned to try to undermine Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan, the Remainers are fighting against the tide of history.\n\nEven if Boris\u2019s plan doesn\u2019t get through Parliament, the direction of travel is clear: the despicable globalists are on the way out and the populists are on the ascendant.\n\nWe\u2019re winning: the good, decent, sensible, value-creating, hard-working, straight-talking, pub-bantering, piss-taking real people are on the verge of trouncing the politically correct, social-justice-worshipping, humourless, economy-draining, finger-wagging, parasitical nonentities who\u2019ve been ruling the roost these last few years.\n\nWe\u2019ve had enough of the Jolyon Maughams and the Gary Linekers and the John Bercows and the Mark Ovlands pratting around on top of our train carriages and preventing us from going where we want to go.\n\nThe Brexit train is about to leave the station. And it\u2019ll take more than a bunch of posturing, prancing gimps to stop us.", "description": "Finally, Britain stands on the brink of Brexit victory, writes James Delingpole \u2013 but he isn't talking about Boris Johnson's new deal...", "authors": ["James Delingpole"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Brexit-Now-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
