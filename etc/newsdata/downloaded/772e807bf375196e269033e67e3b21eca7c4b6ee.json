The DNA samples would be placed in the FBI\u2019s national database known as CODIS, which is used by law enforcement agencies to identify suspects of serious criminal offenses. According to the bureau, it is a key \u201ctool for linking violent crimes.\u201d\n\nDHS officials told reporters Wednesday that the plan is allowed under the DNA Fingerprint Act of 2005, and that they were ending immigrants\u2019 2010 exemption from the law created by Obama\u2019s Attorney General Eric Holder and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano. Since 2010, immigrants who were not detained on criminal charges and people awaiting deportation have not been required to consent to DNA swabs.\n\nThe rule change \u2014 initially reported as a possibility by BuzzFeed News in August \u2014 emerged from a pilot Immigration and Customs Enforcement program from earlier this year in which ICE took voluntary DNA tests of migrants they believed to be faking familial claims. In the two operations, the fraudulent rate was 19 percent and 15 percent. These low success rates for the program show the massive privacy violation inherent in the plan. As the New York Times notes: \u201cImmigrant and privacy advocates said the move raised privacy concerns for an already vulnerable population that could face profiling or discrimination as a result of their personal data being shared among law enforcement authorities. The new rules would allow the government to collect DNA from children, as well as those who seek asylum at legal ports of entry and have not broken the law.\u201d Another population whose rights could potentially be abused: U.S. citizens detained by ICE or Border Patrol, like Dallas-born 18-year-old Francisco Erwin Galicia, who was detained for nearly a month in June, despite showing officials his Social Security Card and birth certificate.\n\nThis year, as the president\u2019s border wall seems to be beyond the reality of his first term, the Trump administration has pursued a number of alternative methods to cut immigration, ranging from low-tech, unlikely, and cruel (building a snake moat and shooting migrants\u2019 legs) to high-tech, ethically terrifying, and cruel (obtaining migrant DNA) and from cutting the refugee cap to its lowest-ever number to firing DHS officials who won\u2019t do his bidding. But taking the DNA of migrants to use in an FBI database is one of the administration\u2019s more blatant signs that it views all undocumented migrants as criminals \u2014 despite there being no causal connection between crime and immigration in the U.S., and that an unauthorized border crossing is only a misdemeanor. Another obvious sign of the stigma the administration is attaching to migrants legally applying for asylum law came from a senior DHS official who told reporters Wednesday that they believed that \u201cThere is a criminal aspect to that population\u201d of above-board asylum applicants.", "description": "The Department of Homeland Security announced that the Department of Justice is working on a regulation requiring immigration officers to collect DNA from migrants to be placed in an FBI database designed to find suspects of serious criminal acts.", "authors": ["Matt Stieb"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/30/migrant_dna.w1200.h630.jpg"}
