According to PNA, the couple was warned by their hotel staff that the woman\u2019s outfit was considered inappropriate, but they decided to ignore these comments as they headed off to the island\u2019s famous white-sand beaches.\n\nAccording to The Daily Mail, the couple visited Puka Beach twice while the woman wore swimwear considered inappropriate.\n\n\u201cThey said it was a form of art,\u201d said BIAMRG chief Natividad Bernardino. The Malay police chief, Major Jess Baylon also told PNA that the woman\u2019s boyfriend claimed that a string bikini was \u201cquite normal for [them] in [their] country and that was her way to express herself with confidence.\u201d\n\nHowever, since the couple was in a foreign country, Bernardino says that they should have heeded the hotel\u2019s warnings as well as local customs. \u201cWe have our own cultural values as Filipinos and Asians. They should be able to respect that,\u201d Bernardino said to PNA. But she added that there are, technically, no official laws regarding dress. \u201cThere is no dress code (being followed). Maybe it is just common sense,\u201d she said.\n\nBaylon told PNA that the woman was fined 2,500 PHP (Philippine Peso, or about $48 USD) for \u201cdisplay of erotic and lewd picture.\u201d\n\nBernardino told PNA that local hotels should be active and tell tourists about proper decorum and dress. Though it seems like it\u2019s really up to guests as to whether they follow the advice.", "description": "A Taiwanese tourist, who was on vacation on\u00a0Boracay Island with her boyfriend, was apprehended and fined for wearing a string bikini that has been called \u201cinappropriate.\u201d", "authors": ["Andrea Romano"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0Zr.bXUAAMXcUZgVzQtEiQ--~B/aD0xMDAwO3c9MTYwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/travel.travelleisure.com/f2399c6dff07d0478041522252aab8ce", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
