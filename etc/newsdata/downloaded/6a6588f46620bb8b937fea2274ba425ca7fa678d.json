The report also said that NRA executives used the organization to benefit themselves.\n\n\u201cThis partisan investigation was fueled by unfounded allegations obviously driven by the minority\u2019s dislike of the NRA\u2019s political point of view,\u201d William A. Brewer III, counsel to the NRA, said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cThe exercise should raise concerns about an abuse of government power and waste of taxpayer funds.\u201d\n\nGroups claiming social welfare status, such as the NRA, can participle in some political activity, but it can\u2019t be their main focus, according to IRS rules. Losing its tax exemption could add to the organization\u2019s financial troubles, which have grown in recent years as the group has been locked in expensive legal battles and executives have squabbled over spending.\n\n(Updates with an NRA statement in the sixth paragraph)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Laura Davison in Washington at ldavison4@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Joe Sobczyk at jsobczyk@bloomberg.net, Laurie Ass\u00e9o, Anna Edgerton\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Two top Senate Democrats are pressuring the Internal Revenue Service to investigate whether the National Rifle Association deserves to be a tax-exempt organization.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon sent a letter to the IRS Wednesday saying that the NRA", "authors": ["Laura Davison"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2BcxNiZaD5CQy8QSWdtNPQ--~B/aD0xMzc1O3c9MTc4NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/d86d688bfea0fc3d90ba3ac1030cb626"}
