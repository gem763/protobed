Flexibility is what the market wants to see.\u201d\n\nThe S&P 500 and Fed interest rate decisions: here\n\nHopes of a rate cut and recent optimism around the trade talks had helped lift the benchmark S&P 500 to record intraday highs for three straight sessions.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 115.54 points, or 0.43%, to 27,186.96, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 9.92 points, or 0.33%, to 3,046.81 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 27.12 points, or 0.33%, to 8,303.98.\n\nTraders work, as a screen shows Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's news conference after the U.S. Federal Reserve interest rates announcement, on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., October 30, 2019.

Shares of General Electric Co (GE.N) jumped 11.47% after the industrial conglomerate beat quarterly profit estimates and raised its cash forecast for the year.\n\nYum Brands Inc (YUM.N) shed 6.22% and was among the top decliners on the benchmark index as the KFC owner missed quarterly profit expectations.\n\nU.S. economic growth slowed less than expected in the third quarter, a Commerce Department report showed, as declining business investment was offset by resilient consumer spending and a rebound in exports, further allaying financial market fears of a recession.\n\nOther data showed a modest acceleration in private sector job growth, boosted by gains in the service sector, according to the ADP National Employment Report. The data comes ahead of Friday\u2019s payrolls report.\n\nAbout 74.1% of the 278 S&P 500 companies that have reported so far have beaten profit estimates, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nHowever, profit growth forecasts for the next four quarters have been revised lower, even as expectations for the decline in third quarter earnings has shrunk to 1.6%, compared with a 2.2% fall at the start of the month.\n\nBuoying the Dow was a 2.88% rise in shares of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N).
