Netanyahu faces possible charges of bribery and breach of trust, pending a final pre-indictment hearing in front of the attorney general scheduled for the first week of October. Netanyahu denies the accusations.\n\nWriting to Blue and White members of the Knesset following his meeting with Netanyahu, Gantz sought to reassure supporters he was not about to drop his opposition to sitting with Netanyahu.\n\n\"(In the meeting) I made clear that the road to unity is through values and through all that we promised to the public that chose us. The public has chosen change and we have no intention of relinquishing our lead, our principles or our natural partners in this path,\" Gantz wrote.\n\nOfficial results from last week's election will be published Wednesday, after which President Rivlin has one week to decide who he will ask to try to form the next government.", "description": "The two men met Monday evening at the President's Residence in Jerusalem.", "authors": ["Andrew Carey", "Amir Vera"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190919110833-netanyahu-y-gantz-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
