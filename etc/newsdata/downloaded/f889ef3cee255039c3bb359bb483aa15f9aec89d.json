REUTERS/Shamil Zhumatov\n\nBaghdadi killed himself during the raid by detonating a suicide vest, Trump said in a televised address from the White House.\n\nHere are reactions to the announcement:\n\nUNITED STATES\n\nJoe Biden, contender for the Democratic nomination to face Trump in the 2020 presidential election:\n\n\u201cWe cannot afford to get distracted or take our eye off the target. ISIS (Islamic State) remains a threat to the American people and our allies, and we must keep up the pressure to prevent ISIS from ever regrouping or again threatening the United States.\u201d\n\nRepublican Senator Lindsay Graham, speaking at the White House:\n\n\u201cWhat the president said today was very reassuring to me \u2014that when it comes to ISIS and other terrorists groups, we\u2019re coming after you, wherever you go, as long as it takes to protect our country and our way of life.\u201d\n\nU.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, criticized Trump not notifying U.S. Congressional leadership prior to the raid. She also said in a statement:\n\n\u201cThe death of al-Baghdadi is significant, but the death of this ISIS (Islamic State) leader does not mean the death of ISIS. Scores of ISIS fighters remain under uncertain conditions in Syrian prisons, and countless others in the region and around the world remain intent on spreading their influence and committing acts of terror.\u201d\n\nU.S. Senator Mitt Romney, a Republican and regular critic of Trump, on Twitter:\n\n\u201cAl Baghdadi spread \u2018fire and brimstone\u2019 on earth; now he feels it for himself in hell. To all who arranged his change of venue\u2014the intel officers, the President, the warriors\u2014thank you.\u201d\n\nIRAQ\n\nIraqi government statement:\n\n\u201cFollowing extensive work by a dedicated team for over a year, Iraq\u2019s National Intelligence Service was able to accurately pinpoint the hideout of the terrorist Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi in the Syrian province of Idlib.\n\n\u201cSubsequently, U.S. forces, in coordination with Iraq\u2019s National Intelligence Service, carried out an operation which led to the elimination of the terrorist Al-Baghdadi.\n\n\u201cIraq\u2019s Armed Forces and intelligence services will continue to work with Iraq\u2019s partners in the @coalition to relentlessly pursue Daesh (Islamic State) terrorists and to defeat their ideology.\u201d\n\nIRAN\n\nInformation Minister Mohammad Javad Azari-Jahromi, tweeted:\n\n\u201cNot a big deal, You just killed your creature\u201d (accusing the United States, its longtime foe, of creating Islamic State)\n\nIranian government spokesman Ali Rabiei tweeted:\n\n\u201cThe killing of Baghdadi will not end Daesh (Islamic State) and its ideology ... which was created and flourished with the help of regional petrodollars.\u201d\n\nRUSSIA\n\nMajor-General Igor Konashenkov, quoted by RIA news agency:\n\n\u201cThe Russian Ministry of Defence does not have reliable information on the operation by U.S. servicemen... on yet another \u2018elimination\u2019 of former IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\u201d\n\nKonstantin Kosachyov, chairman of upper house of parliament\u2019s foreign affairs committee, to Interfax news agency:\n\n\u201c... Last respects have been paid to al-Baghdadi at least five times in the past. (Also) countering terrorism is a much more difficult task than the physical destruction of its leaders, even the most irreconcilable.\u201d\n\nFRANCE\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron on Twitter:\n\n\u201cAl-Baghdadi\u2019s death is a hard blow against Islamic State, but it is just a stage. With our partners in the international coalition, the fight continues to finally defeat this terrorist organisation. It is our priority in the Middle East.\u201d\n\nDefence Minister Florence Parly on Twitter:\n\n\u201cBaghdadi: early retirement for a terrorist, but not for his organisation. I congratulate our American allies with this operation. My thoughts today are for all the victims of the madness of Bagdhadi and the criminals who have followed him.\u201d\n\nBRITAIN\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson on Twitter:\n\n\u201cThe death of Baghdadi is an important moment in our fight against terror but the battle against the evil of Daesh is not yet over. We will work with our coalition partners to bring an end to the murderous, barbaric activities of Daesh once and for all.\u201d\n\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab, on Twitter:\n\n\u201cFollowing the death of Daesh\u2019s leader, we must not allow Daesh to glorify someone who actioned such inhumane & abhorrent criminal acts. The UK will continue to support efforts to #DefeatDaesh.\u201d\n\nTURKEY\n\nPresident Tayyip Erdogan, on Twitter\n\n\u201cThe killing of Daesh\u2019s ringleader marks a turning point in our joint fight against terrorism. Turkey will continue to support anti-terror efforts \u2014 as it has done in the past.\u201d\n\nErdogan added Turkey had paid a heavy price fighting terrorism, including in his list of foes the YPG - Kurdish militia in Syria who were instrumental in fighting with the United States against Islamic State but who Ankara deems terrorists.\n\n\u201cI am confident that a decisive struggle against terrorism, in line with the spirit of alliance, will bring peace to all of humanity.\u201d\n\nSenior aide to Erdogan, Fahrettin Altun, in statement to Reuters:\n\n\u201cTurkey was proud to help the United States, our NATO ally, bring a notorious terrorist to justice.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nISRAEL\n\nStatement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu:\n\n\u201cI would like to congratulate President Trump on the impressive achievement that led to the assassination of the head of (Islamic State) al-Baghdadi. This reflects our shared determination, of the United States of America and of all free countries, to fight terror organizations and terrorist states. This achievement is an important milestone, but the campaign is still ahead of us.\u201d", "description": "President Donald Trump announced on Sunday that fugitive Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had died in a raid by U.S. special forces in northwest Syria, in what he called a major blow to the jihadist group.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191027&t=2&i=1445645132&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9Q0PC", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
