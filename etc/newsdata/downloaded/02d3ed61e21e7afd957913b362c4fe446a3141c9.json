The missionaries often saw their work as an effort to \u201ccivilize\u201d indigenous peoples.\n\nSome reformer missionaries, such as Fra Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas, who became the first bishop of Chiapas, advocated for the rights of the native peoples against abuses by European colonizers, arguing for their equal human dignity.\n\nIn his address Monday, Pope Francis said that in the past, the Church sometimes forgot that its role was not to tame native peoples, and because of this, \u201cit was not inculturized,\u201d but even reached \u201cthe point of scorning certain peoples.\u201d\n\n\u201cIdeologies are a dangerous weapon,\u201d Francis said. \u201cWe always tend to seize an ideology in order to interpret a people. Ideologies are reductive and lead us to exaggerate in our attempt to understand intellectually, but without accepting, understand without admiring, understand without assuming, and then reality is received in categories, the most common of which are the categories of \u2018isms.\u2019\u201d\n\nOver the past months, a number of prominent Catholic prelates have criticized the working document of the Amazon synod of bishops, in part because of its emphasis on indigenism.\n\nIn mid-July, for instance, Cardinal Gerhard M\u00fcller, the former prefect of the Vatican\u2019s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith who has extensive personal experience working in South America, issued a lengthy critique of the document, lamenting its \u201cupside-down hermeneutics\u201d and appeals to a \u201ccosmovision with its myths and the ritual magic of Mother \u2018Nature.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe synod document, in fact, cites the words of the indigenous people in this regard: \u201cWe, the indigenous people of Guaviare (Colombia), are part of nature because we are water, air, earth and life of the environment created by God.\u201d\n\n\u201cTherefore, we ask that the mistreatment and extermination of \u2018Mother Earth\u2019 cease. The earth has blood and is bleeding, the multinationals have cut the veins of our \u2018Mother Earth\u2019. We want our indigenous cry to be heard by the whole world,\u201d it reads.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "Pope Francis kicked off the Vatican synod for the Amazon, urging greater openness to the wisdom and culture of indigenous peoples.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
