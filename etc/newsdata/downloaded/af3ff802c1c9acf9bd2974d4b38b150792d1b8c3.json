Today, academic and cultural elites as well as government officials insist that \u2018gender identity\u2019 is more real than biology,\u201d with at least one website claiming there are at least 63 existing genders.\n\n\u201cThe war on moral common sense has reached new heights of absurdity.\u201d Mr. Curry points out that if we take common-sense steps to protect ourselves from Islamic terrorists, who demonstrably exist in the real world, \u201cwe are said to suffer a psychological condition called \u2018Islamophobia,\u201d which unlike other phobias \u2014 claustrophobia, for instance \u2014 \u201cmakes us victimizers rather than victims.\u201d\n\nAlso, when we attempt to secure our borders, \u201cwe are met by cries that \u2018walls are immoral.\u2019 Evidently the common-sense wisdom that good walls make good neighbors has been taken down by the masters of political correctness.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would be inconceivable to the Founders,\u201d writes Mr. Curry, that the common-sense realism that structured our nation, saw it through our formative years, and made it unique in the world could fall victim to such irrationality.\u201d\n\nBut, as he points out, \u201ca great deal of effort has gone into assailing it. Proponents of irrationalist doctrines that came on in wave after wave beginning in the nineteenth century \u2014 romanticism, Hegelianism, Marxism, progressivism, existentialism, postmodernism, and the like \u2014 have been pounding away at common sense for a very long time.\u201d\n\nFor many years, \u201cthe foundation of an American college education was common sense.\u201d But in the 1960s, the pounding of the irrationalists finally found a point of entry, and the rise of the New Leftists, whose victories seemed minimal at the time, resulted in \u201cpopulating American campuses with politically radicalized professors.\u201d\n\nThose professors, eventually tenured and assisted by radical (or frightened) administrators, have replaced education with \u201cindoctrination in multiculturalism and an ever-changing array of politically correct doctrines that are inimical to the American foundational philosophy.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018The struggle against common sense is the beginning of speculative thinking,\u201d wrote Herbert Marcuse, the philosopher who interpreted Marx for the New Leftists of the 1960s. And that Marxist/Marcusian struggle against common sense continues to motivate the leftists of today.\n\nUnlike the American Revolution, which was successful by any measure, \u201cthe revolutions based on Marxist thinking failed, and failed spectacularly. The Soviet Union murdered its own people in the tens of millions and then collapsed, in part as the result of attempting the impossible: trying to run a country according to Marxist economic ideas.\u201d\n\nMoreover, this continues to be the case today in those countries \u2014 North Korea, Venezuela, Cuba \u2014 that still attempt to apply Marxian principles to the governance of their nations. But what no contemporary champion of those principles will admit is that \u201cthe failure of those ideas to work wherever they have been tried must mean that the ideas are wrong.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, we find candidates competing for the presidential nomination in our own country campaigning on variations of those very principles.\n\nAs Mr. Curry puts it, \u201cEveryone knows, or rather everyone ought to know, that government is always and everywhere inefficient. It\u2019s a common-sense observation, based on the normal experience of government. Yet for the Left, government is always and everywhere the solution.\u201d\n\nAnd that makes no sense at all, common or otherwise.\n\n\u2022 John R. Coyne Jr., a former White House speechwriter, is co-author of \u201cStrictly Right: William F. Buckley Jr. and the American Conservative Movement\u201d (Wiley).\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nRECLAIMING COMMON SENSE: FINDING TRUTH IN A POST-TRUTH WORLD\n\nBy Robert Curry\n\nWith a foreword by Brian T.
