Democrats leading the inquiry have said they want to learn more about how Trump withheld nearly $400 million in military aid while asking Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July 25 call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nHouse Republicans expect to vote Monday on a resolution censuring the leader of the inquiry, Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif. A Republican leader also proposed to change House rules so that any lawmaker could attend the sessions. Republicans have complained about limited access to the sessions.\n\nMonday: GOP calls for Schiff censure\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said Friday there would be a vote Monday on a resolution to censure Schiff. The resolution is unlikely to be approved because Democrats hold a majority in the 435-member chamber, but it is co-sponsored by 165 Republicans.\n\nMcCarthy said Schiff has lied repeatedly during the investigation of Trump. McCarthy argued that Schiff should be held to a higher standard as chairman of the Intelligence Committee because he is privy to information that rank-and-file members don\u2019t receive.\n\n\u201cHe has tried to hide so many of the facts, and then when he was put in position to give the facts, he lied about them,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cHe should be held accountable just like every other member.\u201d\n\nDespite GOP complaints, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has repeatedly supported Schiff's leadership in the inquiry.\n\n\"I'm very proud of the work that Adam Schiff is doing,\" Pelosi told reporters Thursday. \"And this isn't about politics or partisanship. It's about patriotism for our country, and I value the way he is conducting this with equal time on all sides for the questioning that are there.\"\n\nThe censure vote comes after Republicans who aren't on the three key committees tried repeatedly last week to attend the closed-door sessions. But lawmakers were blocked at the door, under a ruling from Schiff and the House parliamentarian.\n\nThe second-ranking Republican in the House, Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., introduced a resolution Friday with Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., to allow all lawmakers to attend all impeachment proceedings including closed-door depositions and transcribed interviews.\n\n\u201cThe American people's elected representatives have been denied access to relevant documents and the opportunity to attend depositions and transcribed interviews,\u201d Scalise said in a statement. \u201cChairman Schiff wants to impeach President Trump behind closed doors and clearly has no intention of conducting a fair and open process.\u201d\n\nSchiff has said the closed sessions are necessary to prevent witnesses from hearing each other's testimony, as happens in a criminal investigation. But Schiff said he anticipates transcripts of the closed sessions will be released and public hearings will be held.\n\nSchiff also said Republicans on the committees and their staffers have been given unlimited time to ask questions of the witnesses. The parties typically alternate an hour or 45 minutes at a time for each side, during sessions that have lasted as long as 10 hours.\n\n\"All of the members of these three committees have been invited to attend and participate and ask questions,\" Schiff said Tuesday. \"They have been very professionally done.\"\n\nTuesday: \u2018Crazy\u2019 Ukraine policy\n\nWilliam Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, questioned Trump\u2019s Ukraine policy in texts revealed as part of the inquiry. Taylor is scheduled to testify privately Tuesday before the House inquiry.\n\nOn Sept. 1, Taylor asked Kurt Volker, the U.S. special envoy to Ukraine, and Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, whether security assistance and a White House meeting between Trump and Zelensky depended upon an investigation.\n\nSondland told Taylor to call him. But Sept. 9, Taylor repeated his concern in another text.", "description": "What's up in the House impeachment inquiry in Week 5?
