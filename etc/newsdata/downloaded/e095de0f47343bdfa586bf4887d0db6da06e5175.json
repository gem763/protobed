Rand Paul and Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney each claiming to be the true representative of Trumpism.\n\nThe dispute reflected a deep divide among Republicans over the aggressive interventionist policies Bolton pushed.\n\nAfter Cheney repeatedly criticized Trump over his Camp David invitation to Taliban negotiators for a meeting that would have overlapped with the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks \u2014 a proposal Bolton is said to have vehemently opposed \u2014 Paul lashed out at the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney.\n\nI agree! Why do some neocons continue to advocate for endless wars? I stand with @realdonaldtrump on ending wars. Let\u2019s focus on America First, not Afghanistan!https://t.co/fyBUbb8Fgf \u2014 Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) September 11, 2019\n\nCheney, whose interventionist, neoconservative foreign policy positions closely mirror those of her father, quickly fired back at Paul, who, like his own father \u2014 former Texas Rep. Ron Paul \u2014 tends toward an isolationist view of American power.\n\nI stand with @realDonaldTrump and our men and women in uniform who will never surrender to terrorists, unlike @RandPaul, who seems to have forgotten that today is 9/11. https://t.co/P0Ok2w48d5 \u2014 Liz Cheney (@Liz_Cheney) September 12, 2019\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump said Bolton \u201cwasn\u2019t in line\u201d with his administration\u2019s philosophy on foreign policy, and criticized Bolton\u2019s past support for the Iraq War, a conflict Cheney\u2019s father helped engineer.\n\n\u201cJohn\u2019s known as a tough guy. He\u2019s so tough he got us into Iraq. That\u2019s tough,\u201d Trump said derisively in the Oval Office.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. (Photos: Scott Applewhite/AP, Mark Wilson/Getty Images) More\n\nThe dispute between Bolton and Trump, as well as the proxy war between Paul and Cheney, illustrates the foreign policy transformations that the Republican Party has undergone in recent years.\n\nLike Cheney, Paul made sure to praise Trump as a way to advance his own foreign policy priorities.\n\nHi @Liz_Cheney, President @realDonaldTrump hears all your NeverTrump warmongering. We all see your pro-Bolton blather. I\u2019m just grateful for a president who, unlike you, supports stopping these endless wars. \u2014 Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) September 12, 2019\n\nCheney then reminded Paul of his own failed presidential bid and included past insults lobbed by Trump himself.\n\nHi @RandPaul I know the 2016 race was painful for you since you were such a big loser (then & now) with a dismal 4.5% in Iowa. No surprise since your motto seems to be \u201cTerrorists First, America Second.\u201d\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s a TBT courtesy of @realDonaldTrump. No truer words were ever spoken https://t.co/7MIM31ZuKl \u2014 Liz Cheney (@Liz_Cheney) September 12, 2019\n\nWith Bolton gone from the White House, the president quickly adjusted his administration\u2019s posture on Iran in a more conciliatory direction.\n\n\u201cI do believe they\u2019d like to make a deal,\u201d Trump told reporters Wednesday. \u201cIf they do, that\u2019s great. And if they don\u2019t, that\u2019s great too.\u201d\n\nTrump, who ridiculed the deal between the U.S. and Iran under President Barack Obama as a giveaway to Tehran, now is said to be considering a French plan to reinstate a version of the pact and extend a $15 billion line of credit to Tehran to make up for lost oil revenues as a result of U.S. sanctions, the Daily Beast reported.\n\nWith the direction of U.S. foreign policy still uncertain, Trump sought to reassure members of his party that he wasn\u2019t retreating from the hard-line policies associated with Bolton.\n\nIn fact, he laid claim to being even tougher than Bolton.\n\nIn fact, my views on Venezuela, and especially Cuba, were far stronger than those of John Bolton. He was holding me back! https://t.co/FUGc02xiac \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 12, 2019\n\nPaul and Cheney, meanwhile, continued their war of words.\n\nHey \u2066@Liz_Cheney\u2069 I feel like you might just be mad still about when Candidate Trump shredded your Dad\u2019s failed foreign policy and endless wars. https://t.co/pTZBivqWaq \u2014 Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) September 12, 2019\n\nWeird. I don\u2019t see you on stage here, @RandPaul.\n\n\n\nOh, right. My bad - you had already lost. #weirdRand https://t.co/mAVkH2VtC6 \u2014 Liz Cheney (@Liz_Cheney) September 12, 2019\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "In the wake of the national security adviser's firing, two Republicans trade barbs over the president's foreign policy.", "authors": ["David Knowles"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2XWqNP457o3jJUgKT5MRMA--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/bb007600-d58f-11e9-bdbe-34fa2ccc0224"}
