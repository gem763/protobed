There were also growing fears the Hong Kong government, which invoked emergency laws to ban face masks at midnight Friday, would take harsher measures to contain the unrest.\n\nHong Kong police detain a protester on Saturday as crowds took to the streets in spite of a ban on masks. All subway and train services were suspended, lines formed at the cash machines of shuttered banks, and shops were closed. AP\n\nChief executive Carrie Lam\u2019s decision Friday to ban the masks, which tens of thousands of protesters have been using to hide their identity and protect themselves from tear gas, backfired spectacularly.\n\nViolence broke out throughout the city on Friday night when protesters lit fires at the entrance to metro stations and clashed with police. A 14-year-old was shot in the leg and was in a serious condition in hospital, according to local media. Police said an officer had fired a shot believing his life was under threat but did not confirm whether anyone was hit.\n\nOn Saturday morning, Hong Kong\u2019s extensive rail network known as the MTR was entirely shut down for the first time in the city\u2019s history.
