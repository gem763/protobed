We\u2019ll split the analysis into three groups: very cheap, mid-tier, and expensive. A greater emphasis will be placed on the lower end of the price scale.\n\nPlease note, these player picks were organized early in the day. For MLB contests, always check lineups and weather closer to game time. Rain, wind, or unexpected managerial decisions could open up additional sources of value. Be sure to keep an eye on the MLB Headlines and Injuries desk.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Stay ahead of the competition from wire to wire with rankings, customizable projections, trade evaluator, exclusive columns and more in our Season Pass. And start using optimized lineups with our DFS Toolkit!\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAll 15 games are a part of the evening slate. Keep an eye on possible rain in Boston and New York.\n\nDIRT CHEAP BARGAINS\n\nJoe Musgrove \u2013 SP \u2013 Pittsburgh Pirates (vs Cardinals)\n\nThe Cardinals offense isn\u2019t especially ferocious against right-handed pitchers (92 wRC+). Nor is it entirely toothless. Despite his piddling price tag, Musgrove offers an interesting range of outcomes and upsides. Certainly, there are scenarios where he fails to last five innings and torpedoes your lineup. However, this downside exists with virtually all pitchers. Musgrove projects to perform like a mid-tier arm. Lately, his fastball velocity has perked up, and his swinging strike and strikeout rates have responded in kind. A quality start with five or more strikeouts would be quite valuable at this price.\n\nRyan McBroom \u2013 1B/OF \u2013 Kansas City Royals (at Pablo Lopez)\n\nStory continues\n\nMcBroom is a right-handed power hitter formerly in the Yankees organization. The 27-year-old was hopelessly buried on the depth chart. Now with the Royals, he\u2019ll receive an extended look in preparation for 2020. He is a fly ball hitter with sufficient plate discipline and contact skills to help DFS participants out of the bargain bin. In 482 Triple-A plate appearances, he hit .315/.402/.574 with 26 home runs, a 12 percent walk rate and a 20.7 percent strikeout rate. He has a one-in-five chance to wallop a home run against Lopez and friends. Nor is he an all-or-nothing hitter. If he doesn\u2019t homer, he may still wind up as an advantageous purchase.\n\nNick Solak \u2013 2B/3B \u2013 Texas Rangers (at Dylan Bundy)\n\nSolak delivered as promised yesterday, hammering a home run off a fly ball pitcher. Tonight\u2019s opponent, Bundy, also has a long history of allowing fly ball contact and way too many home runs. Solak is once again in prime position to produce top DFS output at a very affordable price. The Solak versus Bundy matchup isn\u2019t quite as fiery as yesterday\u2019s pairing. However, since Bundy is less effective than Means, Solak should receive more support from other parts of the Rangers lineup.\n\nGavin Lux \u2013 2B \u2013 Los Angeles Dodgers (vs Jeff Samardzija)\n\nLux has bounced around in the lineup since his call-up at the start of the month. There\u2019s a chance he\u2019ll hit near the top, although it\u2019s more likely we\u2019ll see him batting seventh or eighth. Wherever he lands, he\u2019s so cheaply priced that it\u2019ll be hard to pass him up. Lux is a line drive machine who uses the whole field to his advantage. He works counts and isn\u2019t especially strikeout prone. While nobody should mistake him as a top power threat tonight, it\u2019s very likely he\u2019ll produce something useful for his owners.\n\nAlso Consider: Dillon Peters, Framber Valdez, Ty France, Josh Rojas, Josh Naylor, Mauricio Dubon, Jake Rogers, Phil Ervin, Randal Grichuk, Lorenzo Cain\n\nMID-TIER MUST PLAYS\n\nManny Machado \u2013 SS/3B \u2013 San Diego Padres (vs Tim Melville)\n\nMachado hasn\u2019t quite lived up to expectations since signing with the Padres. In a year when everybody who\u2019s anybody is on pace to hit 30 home runs, it feels like he\u2019s limped along with the pack rather than taking the lead like a so-called superstar. However, a peek under the hood reveals business as usual. His plate discipline is unchanged and his batted ball profile is consistent with past seasons. To me, the obvious conclusion is that his style of hitting doesn\u2019t receive many benefits from the juiced baseball. In any case, dissatisfaction does not mean he\u2019s performing poorly. And he\u2019s still excellently positioned to take advantage of a fly ball pitcher and terrible Rockies bullpen.\n\nAlso Consider: Hunter Renfroe, Victor Robles, Corey Seager\n\nHIGH PRICED VALUES\n\nMike Trout \u2013 OF \u2013 Los Angeles Angels (at Lucas Giolito)\n\nTrout is bizarrely cheap on one of the major platforms this evening. He\u2019s priced more like an expensive mid-tier player than one of the top five hitters in the slate. I suppose we\u2019re supposed to be worried about his matchup against Giolito, but it\u2019s pretty clear that opposing pitcher has very little effect on Mr. Trout. As we all know, he does everything \u2013 a high average/OBP, oodles of run production, and a league-leading homer total. If you\u2019re at all concerned about Trout versus Giolito, just remember the White Sox bullpen is highly exploitable.\n\nAlso Consider: Cody Bellinger, Aristides Aquino, Nelson Cruz, Alex Bregman, Jose Altuve, Max Kepler", "description": "Brad Johnson reviews his favorite MLB DFS bargain targets for Friday, September 6.
