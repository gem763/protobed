They also promise to strengthen existing protections under the law.\n\nForeign companies operating in China have long complained of unfair treatment when it comes to market access, burdensome red tape and weak law enforcement. China\u2019s private firms, which have a harder time accessing financing than state-owned enterprises, have also been harder hit by the economic slowdown.\n\nThe measures said that foreign and domestic companies should be treated equally, as should all types of market entities regardless of ownership.\n\nChina will set up a punitive damage system for infringements on intellectual property, according to the measures. Intellectual property protection is a key issue in negotiations between China and the United States that seek to end a bruising trade war.\n\nThe U.S. should also improve its business environment to make it more convenient for Chinese firms, Ning Jizhe, Vice Chair of the National Development and Reform Commission, China\u2019s state planner, told a news conference.\n\nPublic bids and government procurement should be transparent, fair, and open to all, the measures said.\n\nThe European Chamber of Commerce in China complained of \u201cblatant discrimination\u201d against foreign companies in public procurement, in a paper released in September.\n\n\u201cChina has a vast market. We welcome companies from every country to increase their economic, trade and investment cooperation with China,\u201d said Ning.\n\nThe measures come as recent data points to increasing pressure on China\u2019s economy, which grew at a near-30-year low in the third quarter this year.\n\nImproving the business environment is important for stable economic growth and employment as it can help stimulate entrepreneurship and innovation, said Ning.", "description": "China will implement new regulations that aim to make it easier to do business from Jan. 1, 2020, China's state planner said on Wednesday, amid increasing pressure on the world's second largest economy.", "authors": ["Gabriel Crossley", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444059957&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M0P8", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
