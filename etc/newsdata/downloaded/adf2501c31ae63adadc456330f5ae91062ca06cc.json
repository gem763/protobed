(Picture: Rex Features)\n\nAvengers bosses have revealed Scarlet Witch very nearly escaped Thanos\u2019s Snap in Infinity War.\n\nIf you\u2019ll remember, if your brain hasn\u2019t shunned the information to a place it can\u2019t access, Wanda Maximoff (played by Elizabeth Olsen) was snapped away by the Mad Titan in the pre-curser to this year\u2019s Endgame.\n\nShe had a massive role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), but alongside other powerplayers, including Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), Spider-Man (Tom Holland) and Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) we didn\u2019t see the character for most of Endgame.\n\nThat was until Hulk\u2019s Snap brought a whole bunch of them back and they entered \u2018on the left\u2019 and saved the day.\n\nAnyway, now it\u2019s been revealed Scarlet Witch nearly made it and could have had a larger role in Endgame.\n\nStill heartbroken (Picture: Marvel)\n\nScreenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have dropped some classic buttons of intel as they discussed an early draft of the MCU film.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We had a moment where [Scarlet Witch] looked at [Vision\u2019s] body in a drawer, and it was mainly just maudlin,\u2019 Markus explained to Cinemablend.\n\n\u2018It was also frankly from a draft where she hadn\u2019t been blipped. Because we had a draft where she survived and was a character in Endgame.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018The problem was she\u2019d gotten so much mileage and story in the first movie that she didn\u2019t really have anything that equalled that in the second. So it was a step down.\u2019\n\nSure it was nice to have her return in such a champions way, with her face off with \u2018past\u2019 Thanos bringing the power, we hazard a guess she would have made it much easier to win the war earlier on.\n\nEspecially seeing as Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feige admitted Wanda is strong enough to beat Thanos.\n\nSpeaking with ComicBook.com following the brilliant unveiling of the fourth phrase in the MCU, Kevin noted: \u2018Well, we got a Falcon and Winter Soldier show, we got a WandaVision show. We\u2019re introducing Monica Rambeau in that WandaVision show\u2026\u2019\n\nHe continued on Wanda, noting she \u2018is probably near the upper echelons of power\u2019.\n\nKevin continued: \u2018I contend she would have taken down Thanos if he hadn\u2019t called the [army], it was done.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
