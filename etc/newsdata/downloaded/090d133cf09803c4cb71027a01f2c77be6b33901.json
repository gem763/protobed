His initial reaction, communicated to aides on a White House trade call held that day, was to suggest doubling existing tariffs, according to three people briefed on the matter.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer then enlisted multiple CEOs to call the president and warn him about the impact such a move would have on the stock market and the economy.\n\nHe settled on a 5% hike in tariff rates on about $550 billion in Chinese products, which he announced in an Aug. 23 tweet after the market close.", "description": "", "authors": ["Cnbc.Com Trump-Wanted-To-Double-China-Trade-Tariffs-After-Latest-Retaliation.Html"], "top_image": ""}
