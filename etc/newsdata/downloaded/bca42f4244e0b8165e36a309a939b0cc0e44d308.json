Mr. Trump, asked why he's siding with authoritarian Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan over Kurdish allies, insisted he's not siding with anyone and is adhering to his campaign promise of \"America first.\"\n\n\"I'm not siding with anybody. We've been in Syria for many years. You know, Syria was supposed to be a short-term hit,\" the president said in the Roosevelt Room, where he signed two trade agreements with Japan.\n\nThe president said he's leaving the region in the hands of Turkey, Russia, Iran, Iraq and Syria \u2014 which is exactly what allies fear. Mr. Trump explained that he campaigned on pulling the U.S. out of needless wars in the Middle East, and noted the worst part of his job is writing to families of American soldiers who died.\n\n\"It's the hardest thing I have to do in this job. I hate it. I hate it,\" Mr. Trump said.\n\nThe president insisted he's polling well in the 2020 presidential race and bashed Democratic House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff for moving forward with an impeachment inquiry. The inquiry, sparked by a whistleblower complaint about the president's call with Ukraine's president in which he asked for an investigation into the Bidens, has occupied much of the president's attention in the last week and a half.", "description": "The president insisted he's adhering to his campaign promise of \"America first\"", "authors": ["Kathryn Watson", "Kathryn Watson Is A Politics Reporter For Cbs News Digital."], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/07/67c9b29c-6c5d-479a-9981-45ff3e6c7927/thumbnail/1200x630/3683608f0384f8ad320fcfea6251f22e/gettyimages-1174309188.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
