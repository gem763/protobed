Back in the \u201990s, for example, if a woman wanted to go on a driving date, she\u2019d contact her asshii-kun, so called because he\u2019d have the \u201cautomative\u201d to help her get around, and for those times when she wanted to go out for a meal, she\u2019d call up her messhi-kun (\u201cmeal guy\u201d) to wine and dine her.\n\nLike dating and relationships, though, language evolves, and now there\u2019s a new set of terms for characterizing the men in women\u2019s lives. Even for Japanese people it can be hard to keep up with the new terminology, and that\u2019s exactly what happened recently, following a segment that appeared on a Japanese TV program.\n\nThe tweet above shows terms used for five different types of \u201cfriends\u201d \u2014 in situations where you\u2019re more than friends but not seriously dating \u2014 characterized by the level of intimacy you\u2019re able to have with them. Let\u2019s take a look at the five categories below.\n\nHafure (\u201cHug Friend\u201d)\n\nThis term is used for people you can hug, which may sound a little odd to the rest of the world, but here in Japan, it\u2019s not customary to hug family and friends, so a hug can be quite an intimate act.\n\nKisufure (\u201cKiss Friend\u201d)\n\nThis term is for people you can kiss, which is another level-up on the scale of intimacy in a world where friends and family generally don\u2019t even peck one another on the cheek.\n\nSofure (\u201dSoine Friend\u201d)\n\nThis refers to people you can soine, or sleep next to (without engaging in sexual activity). According to pundits, this act is something you can enjoy on special occasions like birthdays, as it gives people a similar level of intimacy as a post-coital lie-down, but without the feelings of guilt that may come after doing the deed, potentially ruining the friendship for good.\n\nKamofure (\u201cCamouflage Friend\u201d)\n\nThis describes those you can pretend to date, under the guise of friendship as a camouflage. The merits for this type of relationship include the fact that you can go out on dates that aren\u2019t officially discussed as being dates, and even hold hands, hug, or kiss, without having to deal with the pressure of officially dating. However, this can lead to confusion for a lot of men.\n\nSanfure (\u201cSandbag Friend\u201d)\n\n\u201cSandbag\u201d is the Japanese word for punching bag, and as such, this term is reserved for people you can use as a punching bag \u2014 mentally, not physically. This is great for women who want someone to listen as they unload all their stresses on them, but many say this is the worst category for men to be in, as they do all the giving and get nothing in return.\n\nThere are a number of other \u201cfriends\u201d that don\u2019t appear on the televised list above, including \u201cBirifure\u201d (\u201cRehabilitation Friend\u201c), who helps you rehabilitate after a breakup, and \u201cSefure\u201d (\u201cSex Friend\u201c), a friend with all-the-way benefits. And though some people will be more familiar with these terms than others, there was one term discussed on the TV Program that puzzled a number of people online.\n\n\u25bc That term is \u201cOfure\u201c\n\nOfure stands for \u201cOfuro Friend\u201d, meaning a friend you take baths with. And that\u2019s not necessarily referring to mixed-gender public bathing, but private bathing, like the type you take at home.\n\nAs soon as people online heard about \u201cOfure\u201d, they were quick to express their exhaustion at having to keep up with all these confusing terms, while others pointed out that if you\u2019re getting naked with your \u201cofure\u201c, chances are it\u2019s a term that\u2019s simply a euphemism for \u201csefure\u201c.\n\nDespite \u201cOfure\u201d being a term that those in the know have been using for a while, people online were surprised to hear about it, and even more surprised to see that one in five women surveyed have a male friend that they take baths with.\n\nWhile 49 percent of respondents said they didn\u2019t have an \u201cofure\u201d, another 31 percent had no idea what an \u201cofure\u201d was, and this was echoed in a separate Twitter user\u2019s survey on the topic, which showed that even more people \u2013 75 percent at time of writing \u2013 didn\u2019t know what a \u201cbath friend\u201d was.\n\nThe journey from friends to lovers can be a tricky road to navigate, and while terms like these can be hard to keep up with, at least they act like a marker by the side of the road to clarify where you\u2019re at in the dating game.\n\nIf you prefer to ride in the fast lane, though, you can always try marriage without dating, where Japanese women who can\u2019t be bothered with the hassle of dating simply tie the knot with a friend or acquaintance.\n\nSource: My Game News Flash\n\nRead more stories from SoraNews24.\n\n-- Young Japanese women sound off on what does and doesn\u2019t constitute cheating on their boyfriend\n\n-- 31 percent of Japanese women admit to cheating on lover, six percent say they got caught\u3010Survey\u3011\n\n-- Soup not soap: Japanese public bathhouses surviving by converting into retro-chic caf\u00e9s\n\nExternal Link\n\nhttps://soranews24.com/2019/10/15/japanese-women-categorise-male-friends-by-levels-of-intimacy-from-hugging-to-bathing/\n\n\u00a9 SoraNews24", "description": "Over the years, women in Japan have used a lot of terms to categorize their male friends.
