Justin Trudeau and his government promised to act on every one.\n\nIn 2017 his government declared that this would happen \"through a renewed nation-to-nation, Inuit-to-crown and government-to-government relationship based on the recognition of rights, respect, cooperation and partnership.\"\n\nBut what is reconciliation anyway? Does it create transformative change, or is it a feel-good catchphrase used to make us feel virtuous but not requiring much more? And do Indigenous people even agree on what it means?\n\nCindy Blackstock is the executive director of the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society.

She is a member of the Gitxsan First Nation First Nation in northern British Columbia. She is also the executive director of the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society and a professor at the school of social work at McGill University.\n\n\"There is no comprehensive plan by the federal government to implement the recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission \u2026 They say it's complex, but they negotiated a trade agreement with Trump and that is complex. If they can accomplish that, they can end inequality for first nations children and their families,\" she told Enright.\n\nCheryl Ward is the executive director of Indigenous Cultural Safety and Strategy with BC Provincial Health Authority.

In 2008 she helped found the San'yas Indigenous Cultural Safety Training programme, which more than 95,000 health professionals across the country have completed.\n\n\"On whose shoulders does this rest, the idea of reconciliation? It seems like we as Indigenous people carry a very large burden here and what I would like to see, and to see this reflected in the election, is, how do we share that, is this a shared responsibility? And if so, then what's our piece in this and what is the piece for settlers and immigrants?\" she said.\n\nCowboy Smithx is a filmmaker and founder of the Elk Shadows Performing Arts Clan and the Noirfoot School For Cinematic Art.
