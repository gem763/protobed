Then, Russell could see up close how Curry makes almost every shot he takes. Or how Curry creates separation against stronger defenders. Or he could ask Curry any question he had since admiring him growing up.\n\nInstead, the 23-year-old Russell has spent the beginning of his first campaign with the Golden State Warriors trying to learn from his idol in a different manner.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing a lot of spectating, to be honest,\u201d Russell said in an interview with USA TODAY Sports. \u201cI\u2019m just seeing what I can learn from him from a distance. Then, I can come up with the correct questions and the correct demeanor on what I\u2019m trying to learn versus nagging him about stuff.\u201d\n\nThat moment captures Russell\u2019s belief that he can maximize his partnership with Curry by allowing it to grow organically. It also highlights how Russell has become increasingly attentive to details after joining his third team for his fifth NBA season.\n\nCLICK & ROLL: Sign up for our NBA newsletter for exclusive content, must-see moments\n\nAfter the Los Angeles Lakers selected him with the No. 2 pick in the 2015 draft, Russell experienced mixed progress. The Lakers then dealt him to the Brooklyn Nets, and after Russell spent the past two seasons in Brooklyn learning more consistent habits and eventually becoming an All-Star, the Warriors acquired Russell in a sign-and-trade to offset Kevin Durant\u2019s departure.\n\nThrough training camp, Russell\u2019s idol likes what he sees. In the Warriors\u2019 124-103 preseason win over the Lakers on Friday at Chase Center, Russell finished with 29 points while shooting 9-of-19 from the field and 6-of-11 from 3-point range along with three assists. With Curry scoring 32 points on similarly efficient numbers from the field (9-of-20) and from deep (6-of-15), the Warriors are aware their backcourt scoring will largely determine the team\u2019s success this season.\n\n\u201cHe plays at his own pace and is willing to learn,\u201d Curry said of Russell. \u201cHe\u2019s hungry to make that next step in his career.\u201d\n\nA needed caveat. The Warriors treated their preseason finale against the Lakers as a dress rehearsal. Curry, Russell and Draymond Green all played, while the Lakers sat LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Rajon Rondo, Avery Bradley, Dwight Howard and Quinn Cook. So it remains hard to tell if Russell\u2019s performance reveals how well he will complement Curry and offset Klay Thompson\u2019s expected absence through the All-Star break.\n\nThe Warriors have seen positive glimpses, though. Warriors coach Steve Kerr described Russell as \u201ceager to learn\u201d and \u201ca really good teammate.\u201d That includes when Russell either trains with Curry or observes from the sideline.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always helpful to be able to coach a guy after the initial shock of being in the NBA happens,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cOnce a player gets accustomed to the game and figures out how to become a pro and how to work, it\u2019s a lot easier to coach him. I think D\u2019Angelo has really become a pro and has become a great player in this league. We\u2019re getting him at the right time.\u201d\n\nThe Lakers did not draft Russell at the right time. Following Russell\u2019s freshman season at Ohio State, the Lakers became enamored with Russell for his passing, outside shooting and confidence. Russell did not show those qualities consistently both because of organizational dysfunction and self-inflicted wounds. The Lakers placed higher priority on Kobe Bryant\u2019s farewell tour than developing the team\u2019s younger players. Lakers coach Byron Scott also harped more on Russell\u2019s mistakes than his development. Yet, Scott\u2019s frustration also stemmed from Russell\u2019s inconsistent work habits, which prompted Scott to remove Russell\u2019s starting spot 20 games into the season. Russell\u2019s standing within the locker room later diminished after he inadvertently posted a video of teammate Nick Young admitting to infidelities.\n\nOPINION:Kentucky coach John Calipari cries wolf as NBA considers expanded draft\n\nWhen the Lakers hired Luke Walton to replace Scott the following season, Russell thrived more under Walton\u2019s positive reinforcement and modern-based offense. Still, the Lakers traded Russell the following summer to Brooklyn in part to shed a bad contract (Timofey Mozgov\u2019s three-year, $48 million deal), acquiring a proven center (Brook Lopez) and collecting another draft pick (No. 27). But former Lakers president of basketball operations Magic Johnson also suggested the team dealt Russell because of his attitude.\n\nSo even if Russell thanked veterans Bryant, Lou Williams, Metta World Peace and Roy Hibbert for their guidance, Russell viewed the Lakers\u2019 direction with some skepticism.\n\n\u201cI got to see the dysfunction as well. Just being honest,\u201d Russell said. \u201cNot every organization is like that. Coming in as a young player, you see things that you see and you think it\u2019s normal. Then you come to an organization like Brooklyn, and it\u2019s the complete opposite.\u201d\n\nRussell declined respectfully to detail the Lakers\u2019 dysfunction. He only said, \u201cthere is a lot of extra energy with being in a Lakers uniform.\u201d\n\nWalton, the Sacramento Kings\u2019 head coach and a former Warriors assistant (2014-16), spoke with the Warriors\u2019 coaching staff about Russell after his lone season coaching him. Kerr mostly received rave reviews and believes that experience has helped Russell adapt to a similar offense. Yet, Kerr considers Russell\u2019s time with the Nets to be \u201cthe more relevant experience.\u201d\n\nThe reason? Russell began blossoming into a better version of himself. Russell became more empowered under Nets coach Kenny Atkinson, whom Russell described as \u201csuper positive.\u201d Russell liked how the Nets carved out individual player development programs to foster organic growth. Russell also felt increasingly motivated to develop better habits, which included improved sleep, diet and treatment. In related news, Russell made his first appearance in an All-Star Game and playoff series.\n\n\u201cI sacrificed fun and cut that in half,\u201d Russell said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to be just a basketball player, get paid and come here to do that. But to be professional about it is different. I learned how to be a professional.\u201d\n\nThe Warriors noticed. So when Durant left for Brooklyn, the Warriors sought a consolation prize. Mindful that the Nets also agreed to acquire All-Star point guard Kyrie Irving, the Warriors inquired about Russell\u2019s availability. The Lakers wanted Russell to pair him with James and Davis. So did the Minnesota Timberwolves, especially since Karl-Anthony Towns remains close friends with Russell. Russell declined those overtures for the Warriors.\n\n\u201cWhen I was in LA, the structure wasn\u2019t up to par as I wanted it to be,\u201d Russell said. \u201cThen when I went to Brooklyn and I got a taste of what structure was, I came here and am thinking when I had the opportunity to evaluate every team that I was possibly going to, I took structure into consideration.\u201d\n\nRussell also considered that the Warriors offered a max deal worth $117 million for four years.\n\n\u201cI was ready to take it,\u201d Russell said. \u201cI don\u2019t care what team it was. I thought that\u2019s what I deserved. I feel like I played my way into it.\u201d\n\nRussell expressed understanding of the parameters. The Warriors could trade Russell sometime after Dec. 15, leading into the Feb. 6 trade deadline or next summer. Or the Warriors could view him as an investment with Curry, Thompson and Green. Either way, Russell argued, \u201cwhen you\u2019re not the Steph Currys or the Kyrie Irvings of the league, long-term promises are irrelevant.\u201d\n\nHence, Russell has become determined to maximize his time here.\n\nHe has remained open toward operating as a primary ball handler or moving off the ball. He has helped younger teammates with the offensive schemes. He has owned up to his defensive shortcomings. Lastly, he has tried to maximize his learning experience with Curry.\n\nRussell and Curry trained extensively during the summer. Through training camp, Russell often completed individual workouts with Curry. Warriors assistant coach Bruce Fraser, who works closely with Curry, observed that Russell \u201chas kept up with Steph in shooting.\u201d Other times, Russell has also trained with Warriors assistant coach Theo Robertson.\n\n\u201cWhen I get the opportunity to work with (Curry), I try to do that without messing up his routine and his rhythm,\u201d Russell said. \u201cWhenever he allows me to jump in, I\u2019m right there. On other days, when he wants to be by himself, I\u2019m with Theo. It\u2019s kind of a mixed balance.\u201d\n\nAnd it's a balance that Russell\u2019s idol believes he has already mastered.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always asking the right questions. He\u2019s eager to learn and grow,\u201d Curry said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see a guy get paid in the summer and is still hungry to get better.\u201d\n\nFollow USA TODAY NBA writer Mark Medina on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.", "description": "Golden State Warriors guard D'Angelo Russell, a first-time All-Star last season, is already learning from his idol, Stephen Curry.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/19/USAT/4d836c08-fc71-4704-8a2d-dbc5277dfd1d-USP_NBA__Preseason-Minnesota_Timberwolves_at_Golde.JPG?crop=4217,2372,x0,y76&width=3200&height=2134&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
