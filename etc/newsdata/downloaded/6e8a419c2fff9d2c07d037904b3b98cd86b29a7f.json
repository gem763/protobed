The pair remained in close contact, which upset Marie-Louise.\n\nShe gave birth to a son in 1811, Napol\u00e9on Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Charles Bonaparte, and was a devoted mother.\n\nIn 1813, Prussia and the UK joined Russia in declaring war on France, but Austria remained neutral due to the connection between the Imperial families.\n\nAs Napoleon set to battle in Germany, Marie-Louise was appointed Regent and, though she tried to convince her father to ally with France, Austria soon joined the opposition.\n\nIn January 1814, Marie-Louise saw Napoleon ride off into battle for the last time, as he attempted to stave off the Allied invasion in the north of the country.\n\nThree months later, at the instigation of Talleryrand, the Senate announced the deposition of the Emperor and Napoleon abdicated.\n\nWhile he was exiled to Elba, Marie-Louise retained her imperial rank and title, becoming ruler of the duchies of Parma, Piacenza, and Guastalla, with her son as heir.\n\nShe was dissuaded from contacting her husband, who was said to be distraught over the death of his ex-wife, Josephine.\n\nWhen Napoleon escaped in 1815 and reinstated his rule, Marie-Louise was asked by her stepmother to pray for the success of the Austrian armies, but rejected this.\n\nLater that year, when he was defeated in the Battle of Waterloo and exiled to Saint Helena, he made no attempt to contact his wife.\n\nNapoleon died on 5 May 1821 having suffered a hard life in exile, and Marie-Louise went on to marry Count Adam Albert von Neipperg on 8 August, whom she had three children with.\n\nShe fell ill on 9 December 1846, with her condition quickly worsening, and died on December 17.", "description": "Jean-Christophe Napoleon Bonaparte wed Countess Olympia von und zu Arco-Zinnerberg today.
