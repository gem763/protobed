Or is that delving too deep?\"\n\nLouise replied: \"I wish I knew. It was a really sad time, it was devastating for the whole family, and when there's children involved it's something that takes a long time to get over.\"\n\nJudy earlier asked her whether she feels she's had a different artistic approach to the new music, with Louise candidly answering that it's been influenced by the huge changes in her life.\n\n(Image: Dave Benett/Getty Images)\n\n(Image: Internet Unknown)\n\n\"So much has changed in my life,\" she dished. \"This whole album, all you can do is put on what you feel and what you've been through.\"\n\n\"How much of the album is influenced by the end of your marriage?\" Richard wanted to know.\n\nLouise said: \"I never went into the album with it being about that, but naturally when you're in the studio and you're writing and this safe haven, you pour your heart out because that's your safe place.\n\n\"I'd say there are definitely songs on the album that aren't bashing, and it's not about being overly personal. It's just how I felt as a woman, as a mother, as a wife.\"\n\nLouise has previously been forced to deny that her participation in Strictly Come Dancing the previous year, in which she was partnered with Kevin Clifton, was behind her split from Jamie.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nSome fans reckoned that she might have fallen prey to the notorious Strictly Curse.\n\nShe told The Guardian : \"Strictly put the fire back in my belly, but it didn't break up my relationship. After 20 years of marriage, it takes a lot more than that.\"\n\nThe former Eternal star also rubbished claims she and model Daisy Lowe had had an affair.\n\n\"I really think the double standards were coming into play there.\"\n\nShe added: \"Daisy and I only went out together four times or something. So the idea [that I left my husband for Lowe]...I remember my kids saying, 'Mum, are you going out with Daisy Lowe?'\n\n\"And I had to say, 'Guys, no.' I became people's morning entertainment while they read their paper on the train and ate their croissant. I tried to laugh it off, but the damage these stories were doing to me and those around me was huge.\"", "description": "Louise appeared on This Morning with Richard and Judy and told them she's not certain why her marriage to Jamie Redknapp ended", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Dave Benett Getty Images", "Internet Unknown", "Bbc"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article14281933.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/5_MAIN-Jamie-Redknapp-Louise-Redknapp.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
