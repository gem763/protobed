It was his fourth career postseason relief appearance and came after a commanding performance from Stephen Strasburg on the shortest rest of his career.\n\nThe move may force the Nationals to bump Scherzer, their scheduled Game 3 starter, back to Game 4. But with Washington leading the 106-win Dodgers on the road, manager Dave Martinez wagered the one-inning outing was his best bet to fly home with a win.\n\n\u201cYou can see it in Max\u2019s eyes that he was ready to dominate,\u201d closer Daniel Hudson said. \u201cMax out of the \u2018pen is a different animal.\u201d\n\nSince Madison Bumgarner\u2019s five-inning save for San Francisco in Game 7 of the 2014 World Series, it\u2019s become increasingly common for ace starters to be called on for October relief. Those outings have usually come in win-or-go home situations - rarely in the second game of a series.\n\nScherzer\u2019s appearance Friday night may signal a shift. After starting in Tuesday\u2019s NL wild-card game, the 35-year-old was scheduled to throw a bullpen as part of his between-start routine. Martinez simply had Scherzer get his work in during the game.\n\n\u201cI felt I could really go one inning and recover from that,\u201d Scherzer said.\n\nThe Nationals, with their lights-out top of the rotation and rickety relief corps, could be tempted to squeeze similar outings out of Strasburg and Patrick Corbin this month.\n\n\u201cBefore we even got to the playoffs, our game plan was to try to utilize these guys the best way possible without disrupting their starts,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cWe talked to all of them, and they have all been on board.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a risky maneuver - pitchers don\u2019t generally max out during between-start bullpen sessions, and Scherzer could be limited in Game 3 if he starts. But it\u2019s a necessary one for a club trying to limit exposure for its relievers, who tied the Dodgers for the NL high with 29 blown saves during the regular season.\n\nAnd if it works for the Nats, more clubs will certainly try it.\n\n\u201cThis is the playoffs,\u201d Scherzer said. \u201cYou lay it on the line every time you touch that field.\u201d\n\nScherzer planned to rest and recover as much as possible on Saturday, a travel day for both teams, with hopes of being ready to take on MLB ERA leader Hyun-Jin Ryu in Washington.\n\nIf he doesn\u2019t go, Martinez indicated right-hander Anibal S\u00e1nchez would start.\n\n\u201cWe play for one game,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cOur biggest emphasis all year was to go 1-0, and now it\u2019s that time.\u201d\n\nScherzer\u2019s last relief appearance in the postseason didn\u2019t go nearly as well. He pitched in a decisive Game 5 of the 2017 NLDS against the Chicago Cubs, entering the game with a 4-3 lead.\n\nHe got two quick outs before the bottom dropped out. Scherzer gave up four runs (two earned) and three hits to go with a walk, a strikeout and a hit batsman in one inning.\n\n\u201cWith what happened in the Cubs series, how he kind of got some tough breaks, for him to come in there and do that, it was pretty cool to see,\u201d teammate Ryan Zimmerman said of the turnaround.\n\nScherzer turned it over to Hudson for a tense ninth, and sure enough, trouble ensued.\n\nThe closer loaded the bases with two outs before striking out Corey Seager for the save. The inning also included a twisting, falling grab by third baseman Anthony Rendon on Cody Bellinger\u2019s pop fly in shallow left field, as well as a gutsy intentional walk by Martinez that brought the winning run to bat.\n\nMartinez intentionally walked Max Muncy, who hit a solo shot off Sean Doolittle in the seventh, before Hudson walked Will Smith to load the bases. Seager fouled off four fastballs before Hudson got him to swing over a slider.\n\nScherzer followed the roller coaster action from the clubhouse.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all pins and needles,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the postseason. It\u2019s like this every single time.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Washington Nationals turned a bullpen day for one of their aces into a postseason game day, and they may run more starters out for spot stints as a bridge to their unreliable relievers.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Beth Harris"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/05/nlds_nationals_dodgers_baseball_47402_c0-170-4072-2544_s1770x1032.jpg?78457813e2b46eab6f1f8850e809150aa172e6d2", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
