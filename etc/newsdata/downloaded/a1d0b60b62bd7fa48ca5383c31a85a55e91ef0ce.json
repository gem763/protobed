In September, salary history bans or laws that protect job candidates who refuse to answer questions about past pay will become effective in three more states: Illinois, Maine and Alabama. That will bring the tally of statewide bans to 14 plus Puerto Rico, according to the National Women\u2019s Law Center; two more states, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, have bans in place for applicants to state agencies. (A range of cities and counties also have laws in place; Washington, D.C., and Montgomery County, Md., ban local government agencies from asking applicants about salary history.)\n\nExperts say many employers are likely following the laws closely, eliminating the question from online and paper job applications and training their managers not to pose it in interviews. \u201cEmployers are taking it seriously,\u201d said Cheryl Pinarchick, an attorney with Fisher Phillips in Boston who represents employers.\n\n[Even top workplaces face problems with diversity pay gaps]\n\nBut some, she said, have been \u201cslower to take that practical step they need to take to educate everyone in the hiring chain. There\u2019s still a lot of folks in hiring positions who just don\u2019t know.\u201d The laws are new enough that the questions may still come up, especially at smaller employers without dedicated H.R. teams or in discussions behind closed doors. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to police,\u201d Pinarchick said.\n\nIf candidates do get the question where it\u2019s banned, experts say they should answer with a little deflection \u2014 and a lot of tact. You may not want to tell a potential employer in a job interview they\u2019re doing something illegal \u2014 especially if it\u2019s a job you really want.\n\n\u201cWhat you have to do is punt on the question ... like a politician who [answers] a different question,\u201d said Linda Babcock, an economics professor at Carnegie Mellon University who studies negotiations and is the author of \u201cAsking for It: How Women Can Use the Power of Negotiation to Get What They Really Want.\u201d If it\u2019s early in the process, Babcock suggests saying something like: \u201cI would really like to learn more about the job to learn what\u2019s entailed to really give a good answer.\u201d\n\nCalling out an interviewer for asking a banned question, said Kimberly Churches, chief executive of the American Association of University Women, \"puts you in an offensive and defensive position,\u201d she said. \u201cYou lose that ability of keeping things civil.\u201d\n\nIf asked about salary history \u2014 whatever state you live in \u2014 her organization suggests saying something like \u201cthis position is not exactly the same as my last job. I\u2019d like to discuss what my responsibilities would be here and then determine a fair salary for this job.\u201d Another recommended response: \u201cI\u2019d appreciate it if you could make an offer based on whatever you have budgeted for this position, and we can go from there.\u201d\n\nKatie Donovan, an equal pay and salary negotiations expert in Boston who said she helped write the Massachusetts legislation, also recommended bringing up budgets. If an employer doesn\u2019t go first with a salary range or asks about salary expectations, Donovan suggested saying: \u201cI know you wouldn\u2019t be interviewing if the job hasn\u2019t been budgeted for and accounted for.\u201d\n\nGenerally, lawyers say you can volunteer your own salary history and not be penalized \u2014 even if the employer can\u2019t seek it out. Other laws say employers can ask the question after a job offer (with a compensation figure) is made \u2014 a stipulation that raised concerns from one expert. \u201cThey could lowball you to start and then ask about your salary history\u201d in negotiations, said Babcock, suggesting that could take some \u201cteeth\u201d out of the laws.\n\nShe and other experts said the inability to ask about salary history is also likely to lead to more questions about salary \u201cexpectations,\u201d which are permitted. While you may be forced to name a number you hope to make \u2014 backed up by research and homework, experts advised \u2014 asking for a range is another advisable step. A few states (California, Colorado and Washington) even now require employers to offer a minimum salary or pay range when asked.\n\n[Amazon, Bank of America and Facebook are under pressure to reveal their median gender pay gap]\n\nStill, many employers continue to want employees to put the first number on the table, said Paula Brantner, a workplace consultant and the former director of Workplace Fairness, a nonprofit focused on employee rights. \u201cWe still haven\u2019t had the mind shift where employers think they should go first. It\u2019s kind of a game of chicken.\u201d\n\nIf you want to report an employer for asking the question, state laws vary on where to complain, said Emily Martin, the vice president for education and workplace justice at the National Women\u2019s Law Center. She suggests starting with the state human rights division \u2014 or whatever state agency is responsible for addressing employment discrimination \u2014 to inquire about where to take a complaint. If the banned question happens to still pop up in an online job application, she said, be sure to get an image.\n\n\"It\u2019s not a perfect solution, but the hope is that by insuring that it\u2019s not a standardized question,\u201d it will help close the pay gap, Martin said. She said it\u2019s striking how many states have already picked up on the idea. \u201cPeople understand this as an issue that goes to fundamental fairness about work and power and recognize the idea that you should have some control over this information.\u201d\n\nRead also:\n\nCitigroup is revealing pay gap data most companies don\u2019t want to share\n\nLike On Leadership?
