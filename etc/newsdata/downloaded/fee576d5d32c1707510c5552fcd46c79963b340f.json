According to the New York Times, Margaret Atwood\u2019s The Testaments and Bernardine Evaristo\u2019s Girl, Woman, Other tied for this year\u2019s award. Turns out, the sequel to Atwood\u2019s The Handmaid\u2019s Tale and Evaristo\u2019s portrait of black British womanhood as explored through twelve characters were both so good, the Booker Prize judges opted to ignore the part where they technically can\u2019t give the award to more than a single author at a time.\n\n\u201cWe were told quite firmly that the rules state you can only have one winner,\u201d Booker chairman Peter Florence said at a London news conference on Monday, but the judges\u2019 \u201cconsensus was to flout the rules and divide this year\u2019s prize to celebrate two winners.\u201d Interestingly enough, this is not the first time two novels have both been awarded the prize at one time. The one-winner rule was actually instituted following a tie in 1992 between Michael Ondaatje\u2019s The English Patient and Barry Unsworth\u2019s Sacred Hunger, but once there\u2019s historical precedent, well, cat\u2019s out of the (book) bag.\n\nAs a result of their double win, Evaristo and Atwood will split the \u00a350,000 prize, but hopefully not the fame and glory. Atwood has previously won for 2000\u2019s The Blind Assassin. Evaristo is the first black woman to receive the prize. As the author said at Monday\u2019s ceremony while accepting her win, \u201cI hope that honor doesn\u2019t last too long.\u201d", "description": "Margaret Atwood\u2019s \u201cThe Testaments,\u201d her follow up to \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d ties with author Bernardine Evaristo\u2019s \u201cGirl, Woman, Other\u201d to win the 2019 Man Booker Prize in fiction.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/14-Margaret-Atwood-Bernardine-Evaristo.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
