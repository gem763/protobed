And when you have a superstar like this who just bombs it. You\u2019ve got to be very happy.\u201d\n\nSpaniard Carlota Ciganda and Bronte Law nearly won their match for Europe against Jessica Korda and Lexi Thompson, who struggled with her putting throughout the day.\n\nBut the honours were shared when, on the 18th hole, Thompson regained her touch and sank a birdie from nearly 20 feet to halve the match after both Europeans missed their putts.\n\nEarlier, Americans Jessica and Nelly Korda had become the first sister pairing to earn a point at the Solheim Cup but Team Europe emerged from the foursomes with a one-point lead.\n\nCatriona Matthew\u2019s European team, roared on by raucous support from the stands, were indebted to Charley Hull and Spain\u2019s Azahara Munoz for some remarkable clutch play.\n\nHull delivered a near-perfect approach shot to seal a birdie at the 13th hole and that set up a decisive 2 & 1 victory over the U.S. pairing of Megan Khang and Annie Park.\n\nTeeing off in the third match of the morning, the Korda sisters were five up on the front nine and went on to put the Americans on the board with a convincing 6 & 4 victory over Caroline Masson and Jodi Ewart Shadoff.\n\nU.S. captain Juli Inkster was initially sceptical about the merits of pairing the sisters but went ahead after their impressive showing at the Dow Great Lakes Bay Invitational in July where they finished in a tie for 12th place.\n\nJessica said the secret to their success in the alternate-shot format was having each other\u2019s backs at Gleneagles, the venue for the 2014 Ryder Cup.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if I hit a bad shot, (Nelly\u2019s) like, \u2018I\u2019ve got this\u2019, and it\u2019s the same the other way,\u201d said 26-year-old Jessica, who is five years older than her sister. \u201cThere\u2019s no disappointment either way, especially in this format.\u201d\n\nGeorgia Hall and Celine Boutier earned Europe their first point with a 2 & 1 win over Thompson and Brittany Altomare.\n\nLaw and Ciganda halved with Americans Morgan Pressel and Marina Alex, with Ciganda pulling off one of the shots of the day when she sank a 30-foot putt on the 17th to level the match.", "description": "Team Europe took a one-point advantage over the U.S. into the second day of the Solheim Cup with a 4-1/2 to 3-1/2 lead after Friday's foursomes and fourballs at Gleneagles.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429551234&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C24Y", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
