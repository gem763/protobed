Janette's dress got caught on Paralympian Will's head during the pair's daring final life, but the pro dancer admitted that she didn't even realise the mishap had occurred\n\n'I didn't know it happened on the night,' she said. 'I remember because I said to him, \"No matter what happens, when we get to that last lift, you stand steady and you walk forward with power and strength,\" and he did exactly that.'\n\nWill explained: 'It went over my head and I was like, \"How am I going to style this out?\"' while Rylan quipped: 'All those weeks of training, that's what it's paid off for.'\n\nThe blunder didn't affect the pair's score, as they earned 32 from the judges - their highest score so far.\n\nStyled it out: Janette said: 'I remember because I said to him, \"No matter what happens, when we get to that last lift, you stand steady and you walk forward with power and strength\"'\n\nThe contenders performed their contemporary Couple's Choice routine after Will revealed he was diagnosed with cancer aged seven and also spoke about his arthrogryposis diagnosis.\n\nThe Paralympic table tennis player, 31, dedicated the routine to the patients and staff at Great Ormond Street Hospital before receiving a glowing response from the audience and judges.\n\nHe was given an overall score of 32 points, with Motsi so overcome with emotion that she was unable to talk.\n\nEmotional: Strictly judge Motsi Mabuse was brought to tears by Will and Janette's performance\n\nWill ran over and embraced her over the judges' desk, prompting wild cheers from spectators.\n\nAnd Alfonso Ribiero, who was failing in his attempt to fight back his own tears, said: 'You gave me chills. That was incredibly inspiring.\n\n'There will be young boys and girls who watch that routine and know anything is possible.'\n\nCraig Revel Horwood added: 'Clear, emotional storytelling, an absolutely complete inspiration.\n\nHead judge Shirley Ballas also gave the sports star a ringing endorsement, saying she found his performance 'inspiring'.\n\nYou need a hug: Will ran over and embraced an emotional Motsi over the judges' desk, prompting wild cheers from spectators\n\n'Well this is you. You came out here you shared your journey,' she said.\n\n'I'm sure every child in every children's hospital is looking at that today and has discovered that no matter what you put your mind to you can do it under extreme circumstances.'\n\n'I find it inspiring, you give the whole nation hope. It is just a beautiful number and just so well executed,' she added.\n\nWhen the pair went upstairs to reunite with their fellow dancers, Catherine Tyldesley was also in tears.\n\nEmotional: Alfonso Ribiero, who was failing in his attempt to fight back his own tears, said: 'You gave me chills. That was incredibly inspiring'\n\nWill Bayley had discussed his condition before the routine.\n\nHe said: 'I didn't think I'd struggle as much as I am with balancing. I had a great childhood but it was really challenging.\n\n'When I was seven years old I went to Great Ormond Street and they diagnosed me with Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma, as a seven-year-old to have cancer was so scary.\n\n'But the doctors and the nurses were so amazing. I had so much support and love around me.'\n\nTear-jerker: When the pair went upstairs to meet and reunite with their fellow dancers, Catherine Tyldesley was also in tears\n\n'It gave me so much confidence and made me who I am.'\n\nWill's arthrogryposis affects all four of his limbs and causes multiple curved joints from birth. It generally results in stiff joints and muscle weakness.\n\nWill learnt to play table tennis when his grandmother bought him a table following his cancer diagnosis.\n\nHe joined the local club at the age of 12 and went on to represent Kent's able bodied men's team before winning the gold medal at the 2016 Paralympic games.\n\nThis weekend's show is the Halloween special with Will and Janette dancing a Jive to Casper by Little Richard.\n\nStrictly continues on BBC One on Saturday night.", "description": "Janette's dress got caught on Paralympian Will's head during the pair's daring final lift, but the pro dancer admitted during Strictly's spin off show that she didn't even realise the mishap had occurred.", "authors": ["Joanna Crawley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/13/20129216-0-image-a-48_1571918724202.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
