Trading oil might be one example, but so is deciding what order to do things in the morning, given the endless possibilities.\n\nPerfect foresight\n\nHe\u2019s interested in how humans cope with this complexity, whether we can get better at managing it, and how markets might provide some help.\n\nWhich brings us to his paper.\n\nThe idea that prices are always right relies on the concept of perfect foresight \u2013 that is, those in the market are somehow super-human and can know prices in all contingencies.\n\nClearly, markets are far too complex even to try to do that. And we know from behavioural scientists including Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky (the psychologists who starred in Michael Lewis\u2019s terrific book, The Undoing Project) that people aren\u2019t like that.\n\nThey tend to be pretty myopic and use what Kahneman and Tversky call \u201cnarrow framing\u201d to make decisions based on what they know about their own circumstances.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo if humans are so flawed, how can prices magically be right?\n\nTo find out, Bossaerts ran a series of experiments where he had groups of people trade commodities for a period. What he found, essentially, was that people do throw their hands up at the complexity in markets and use narrow framing to make their decisions.\n\nEssentially, they ignore that they might have the ability to retrade that commodity in the future, and make their decisions based on their own supply and demand needs.\n\nThe majority of people act in the same way, creating a sort of collective rationality\n\nThe \u201cmagic\u201d comes from the fact that the majority of people act in the same way, creating a sort of collective rationality.\n\n\u201cBecause personal supplies add up to the total supply, it\u2019s as if we\u2019re actually trading the whole market,\u201d Bossaerts says.\n\nHe says this helps explains why index investing can be the best way to play public markets.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean mispricing opportunities don\u2019t exist, and the more speculation there is in a market \u2013 that is, the less people use narrow framing and start trying to second guess future contingencies in a market \u2013 the bigger the opportunity to find that mispricing.\n\nThis is the great hope for asset managers, and helps explain why many are turning to alternative investments \u2013 private equity and other forms of private capital \u2013 to find returns.\n\n\u201cThere are plenty of markets where if you see speculation, you just go for it and try and figure out what\u2019s wrong,\u201d Bossaerts says.", "description": "As the hunt for yield gets harder, new work from Melbourne-based Professor Peter Bossaerts shows why index investing is a good bet.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7936%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_89/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a60bae69f30ed891990d2e1cacbe8fd281e913b5", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
