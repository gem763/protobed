So, it\u2019s not surprising when it does, only when it doesn\u2019t. On the other hand, it\u2019s easier to be impressed with an affordable restaurant. You\u2019re probably not expecting much or spending a lot, and while there are usually compromises, the right meal could make it your favorite spot.\n\nThis same experience can happen with smartphones, though you shouldn\u2019t eat your phone. Spending over $500 will get you a feature-rich flagship smartphone, precisely crafted to delight both in terms of hardware design and software. Some cheaper devices are akin to quick fast food: they can get the job done, and usually not much else. But, being on a budget doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re out of luck.\n\nIncreasingly, flagship features, design, and software are coming to low-cost phones. Look no further than the $399 Google Pixel 3A for proof. It has the same excellent camera from the $799 Pixel 3, and much of the same design, too. This more reasonable price results in a phone that\u2019s made out of plastic, and has hardware that\u2019s a little more sluggish to use than you\u2019d expect from a flagship phone. It\u2019s tough to beat the value if you just want a somewhat affordable phone with a good camera, but $400 is still a lot of money.\n\nSo what can you get for half that? Surprisingly, for less than $200 you can find phones that look and feel like a more costly device, built with glass and featuring the latest Android 9 Pie software, or with a big, bright screen that\u2019s suited for watching movies and TV shows. I was surprised by the breadth of options available for under $200, so I checked out three phones to get a sense of what your money gets you: the $189 Nokia 4.2, the $179 Coolpad Legacy, and the $199 Rokit IO 3D.\n\nThese three phones run the spectrum of what you can get in this price range, whether that\u2019s a big, bright screen, sleek design and software, or forward-looking features that may turn out to be more gimmick than utility. They also have a deep bench of modern features, like a fingerprint sensor, dual rear-facing cameras, and in some cases, dual SIM card support. Simply put, being on a budget doesn\u2019t box you in as much as you might have thought.\n\nOur review of Coolpad Legacy Verge Score 6 out of 10 Good Stuff Big, vibrant 1080p display\n\nSlightly more powerful than the Nokia 4.2\n\nCharges over USB-C Bad Stuff Exclusive to Metro by T-Mobile\n\nIt comes with a lot of carrier bloatware\n\nThe software lacks polish\n\nPhotos usually come out blurry Buy for $179.99 from Metro by T-Mobile\n\nOur review of RoKit IO 3D Verge Score 3 out of 10 Good Stuff It has a removable battery\n\nDual SIM card support is an unexpected bonus Bad Stuff The screen quality is atrocious\n\nIt\u2019s much slower than the other options\n\n$200 is far too steep of an asking price Buy for $199.99 from Walmart\n\nIt\u2019s reasonable to expect that a sub-$200 phone won\u2019t give you everything that you\u2019d find in a more expensive model, but the Nokia 4.2 comes the closest to doing it. A big part of its success leans on its software, which is nearly stock Android 9 Pie. This phone is part of Google\u2019s Android One program, which succeeds in bringing a less demanding version of the Google Pixel\u2019s software to affordable phones, with the latest security and feature updates in tow. It will receive Android Q, as well as future platform updates for two years and security patches for three years from launch. Reliable updates are something that less-expensive phones have always lacked, so it\u2019s impressive to see Nokia\u2019s commitment here. I installed my Pixel 3 software backup onto the Nokia 4.2 and I felt mostly at home here, though the performance is certainly less responsive on the Nokia.\n\nThis phone uses Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 439 processor and has 3GB of RAM. This is more than enough power for basic tasks like messaging, using the phone, and browsing on Chrome, but even so, a noticeable lag is usually present when browsing through the menus and opening or switching apps. Games like Pok\u00e9mon Rumble Rush and PUBG run at choppy, but respectable frame rates on low settings.\n\nSoftware plays a big role in the success of the Nokia 4.2\n\nThis ho-hum performance also rears its head in the camera. The phone is slow to capture photos, and its screen doesn\u2019t provide a reliable viewfinder; it looks much brighter than the captured photos turn out. However, Nokia\u2019s phone takes the best photos between the three devices that I tested. The photo results from the Coolpad Legacy and Rokit IO 3D are blurry, even when I\u2019m standing still. Is the Nokia 4.2 as good at taking photos as the Google Pixel 3A? No, but what it can do for $200 less is impressive.\n\nThe Nokia 4.2 has a few extra tricks that you don\u2019t see every day, even in many of the most expensive phones. Its power button illuminates when you receive a notification. It\u2019s easier to notice from across the room than most notification LEDs, which are usually implemented near the selfie camera on phones, a place where you can\u2019t see it blinking unless you\u2019re right next to it. Another interesting feature is its Google Assistant button on its left side that can give you immediate access to the voice assistant without yelling \u201cHey Google.\u201d It can\u2019t be remapped to another function, which is disappointing, but this is a cool feature to have found its way into a budget-friendly phone.\n\nOf the three devices that I tested, the Nokia 4.2 comes the closest to feeling like a more premium \u2014 and expensive \u2014 device. The software definitely aids in this, and its glass-covered body looks and feels good to carry. If you need an inexpensive device, this could be a good fit \u2014 that is, if you can deal with its Micro USB charging port. USB-C is so much easier to plug into, and the Coolpad Legacy\u2019s USB-C charging port offers faster charging speeds.\n\nCoolpad\u2019s phone has USB-C fast charging and a huge screen\n\nA Metro by T-Mobile exclusive, the Coolpad Legacy is the better choice if you want a bigger, brighter, and slightly more colorful display. The Legacy is, in a few other ways, a better phone than the Nokia 4.2, even if I do prefer the latter\u2019s design and feel. Coolpad\u2019s phone looks like a premium phablet, covered on its front and back with glass. Its 6.4-inch, 1080p display dwarfs the Nokia\u2019s 5.7-inch, 720p screen. Some Verge staffers preferred the feel of this device over the Nokia 4.2, and if you like big phones, you may prefer it, too.\n\nThe Legacy has a slightly more capable processor than the Nokia 4.2 (Snapdragon 450 vs. Snapdragon 439), and it\u2019s just a little bit more zippy during general use. This phone\u2019s larger, higher-resolution display makes it the better choice if you watch a lot of TV shows or movies, and play the occasional game. Like Nokia\u2019s phone, it can handle intensive games, like PUBG, at around 30 frames per second.\n\nThese perks aside, it doesn\u2019t have it all figured out. Its cameras take noticeably worse pictures than the Nokia 4.2, and some of the Coolpad Legacy\u2019s speed advantage is put to waste on Metro by T-Mobile\u2019s bloatware. This phone costs just $29 if you switch to the carrier and sign up with a $50 per month plan, though it\u2019s $179 otherwise. But, no matter how you buy it, it comes with eight of the carrier\u2019s apps preinstalled and you cannot uninstall them. Most of them aren\u2019t too intrusive on the experience, with the exception being the MetroZone news app, which at times launches automatically when I unlock the phone. This example and Coolpad\u2019s software in general, which lacks the slick animations and polish of the stock Android OS that arrives in the Nokia 4.2, make the Legacy feel like a budget phone.\n\nRokit\u2019s phone is an example of what you shouldn\u2019t spend your $200 on\n\nI haven\u2019t brought the Rokit IO 3D into the equation yet because, at $199, it\u2019s by far the worst value of the bunch. As its name indicates, it dabbles with 3D in a manner that\u2019s somewhat similar (ambitious as an idea, bad in execution) to the RED Hydrogen One. This one can display photos that you take in 3D, but the results aren\u2019t great, and worse, the screen quality is atrocious. It has a 720p display, like the Nokia 4.2, but it looks significantly worse with poor viewing angles and noticeable pixelation in text.\n\nThe Rokit IO 3D comes with Facebook, Amazon, and The Weather Channel apps preinstalled out of the box, and Rokit has a few apps of its own installed, too. One is a collection of 3D content that takes advantage of its 3D-capable display, and the other is an account management app that people can use to access its ROK Health service, which claims to offer medical advice over the phone and savings on pharmacy bills to people who buy the device. These could be useful features, but I can\u2019t vouch for how long Rokit will work to grow its library of 3D content, or how exactly it plans to help you save money on medicine.\n\nYou should steer clear of this phone. Its MediaTek processor is slow, the screen is horrible, the build quality is worse than the others, and the Android 8 Oreo software somehow is really rough around the edges. If the Rokit IO 3D were $100 less, it\u2019d be a more acceptable value, but I wouldn\u2019t be any more likely to recommend it.\n\nWe\u2019re not at the point where $200 phones are going to win awards or be the clear choice compared to more expensive devices. That time may eventually come, but for now, it\u2019s easy enough to find a device that\u2019s capable \u2014 and enjoyable \u2014 to use.
