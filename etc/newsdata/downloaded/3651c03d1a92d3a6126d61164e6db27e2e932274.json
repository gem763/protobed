The Japanese company has released some information about its test vehicles and the types of sensors it\u2019s using, but we\u2019ve seen very little of the cars in operation.\n\nThat\u2019s about to change in 2020: Toyota says it will be conducting a limited ride-hailing pilot in downtown Tokyo with its fleet of \u201cSAE Level-4\u201d automated vehicles. (SAE stands for the Society of Automobile Engineers, and Level 4 is a reference to the group\u2019s classification for an autonomous vehicle that can perform all of the driving tasks under a specific set of conditions, such as weather or geography.)\n\nToyota may be calling its cars Level 4, but that doesn\u2019t mean they will be completely driverless\n\nToyota may be calling its cars Level 4, but that doesn\u2019t mean they will be completely driverless. Japanese law requires a safety driver behind the wheel at all times who is ready to intervene and take control when necessary. There will also be a technician in the car analyzing the system and vehicle performance and communicating with the safety driver, Toyota says. These trips will likely resemble self-driving tests in the US where all but a very small number of operators keep two employees in the car at all times.\n\nToyota is only offering rides in its cars for a small window of time: July to September. The cars will be geofenced, meaning they will be restricted to a specific geographic area within Tokyo\u2019s busy Odaiba district. \u201cOdaiba\u2019s complex environment of pedestrians, vehicle traffic, diverse road infrastructure and tall glass buildings provide a challenging setting in which to demonstrate the capabilities of Toyota\u2019s automated driving technology,\u201d Toyota says. People who are interested in riding in the cars can sign up at Toyota\u2019s website; the automaker will then select a group to participate.\n\nThe cars will be equipped with Toyota\u2019s \u201cChauffeur\u201d software, which the automaker has previously described as \u201cfocused on full autonomy, where the human is essentially removed from the driving equation, either completely in all environments, or within a restricted driving domain.\u201d Toyota has a second AV product called \u201cGuardian,\u201d which is essentially an advanced driver-assist system, akin to Tesla\u2019s Autopilot. Neither is being offered in any production car today.\n\nToyota Research Institute, the automaker\u2019s Silicon Valley-based division, has been conducting tests in the US at its Ottawa Lake, Michigan, closed-course facility for a number of years. There, the institute \u201creplicated Odaiba\u2019s most challenging infrastructure characteristics and driving scenarios\u201d for its vehicles to navigate, Toyota said.\n\nThe pilot is meant to coincide with the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. The automaker has also said it will use the occasion to demonstrate its solid-state batteries for electric vehicles. The automaker also said it will provide \u201c3,700 mobility products and/or vehicles\u201d for the Olympics, 90 percent of which will be \u201celectrified.\u201d That can mean either battery-electric, hydrogen-powered, or even gas-electric hybrids. Of the 3,700 vehicles, 850 will be battery-electric and 500 will be fuel-cell electric.\n\nLast year, Toyota agreed to invest $500 million in a joint self-driving project with Uber. As part of the agreement, the two companies will work together on developing self-driving cars.", "description": "Toyota, the world\u2019s largest automaker, has largely kept quiet on its self-driving car program.
