I always told them this wasn't in my hands. I guess I won't be asked that question any more,\" said Sarker.\n\nBangladesh is the world's third-largest Muslim majority nation and nearly 90% of its 168 million population are Muslims.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
