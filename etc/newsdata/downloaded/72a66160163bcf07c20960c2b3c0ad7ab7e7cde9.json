FOREX-Dollar on back foot after U.S. service sector survey fans recession worries\n\n* Dollar near 1-month low vs yen, euro recovers from 2 1/2-yr low\n\n* U.S. payrolls data next big focus\n\n* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh\n\nBy Hideyuki Sano\n\nTOKYO, Oct 4 (Reuters) - The dollar stepped back on Friday after a soft U.S. service sector survey stoked worries that pressure from U.S. trade disputes with China and other countries could spill over into the broader U.S. economy and tip it into a recession.\n\nThe =USD fell to 98.905, shedding about 0.8% after hitting 2 1/2-year high this week.\n\nAgainst the yen, the U.S. currency eased to 106.91 yen , having fallen to one-month low of 106.48 in U.S. trade on Thursday. euro stood at $1.0972 , extending its recovery from a near 2 1/2-year low of $1.0879 set on Tuesday.\n\nThe survey from the U.S. Institute for Supply Management (ISM) showed its non-manufacturing activity index falling to 52.6 in September, the lowest since August 2016, and far below expectations of 55.1, from 56.4 in August. on the heels of a similar survey on manufacturing, announced on Tuesday, showing activity plunging to a more than 10-year low, the weak data increased fears of a U.S. recession.\n\nA gauge of employment in the survey fell to 50.4 last month, the lowest reading since February 2014, from 53.1 in August.\n\nThat does not bode well for the upcoming all-important U.S. jobs data on Friday, said Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Bank, noting the employment component in the ISM has had a meaningful correlation with the payrolls data.\n\n\"It is reasonable to think the non-farm payrolls figure is more likely than not to come on the disappointing side. It could even fall below zero,\" he said.\n\nThe median economists forecast polled by Reuters is a rise of 145,000 in September.\n\nHeightened worries about the U.S. service sector increased expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at the end of this month, undermining the dollar's yield advantage.\n\nFed funds rate futures FFX9 FFF0 are almost fully pricing in a 25 basis point rate cut and a high chance of another cut by December.\n\nBut some market players think rate cuts are far from a done deal.\n\n\"Opinions in markets over whether the Fed needs to cut rates that much are divided. The dollar is not going to fall sharply given not everyone thinks the Fed will cut rates this month,\" said Kazushige Kaida, forex manager at State Street (NYSE: ).\n\nElsewhere, sterling traded at $1.2333 GBP=D4 , having risen to one-week high of $1.2413 on Thursday after the head of a group of eurosceptic lawmakers in Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative Party said the government's latest Brexit proposals offered the possibility of a \"tolerable deal.\" traders remained unsure whether Johnson's proposal to replace the Irish border \"backstop\" was going to morph into a final Brexit divorce agreement due to mixed messages coming from both sides.", "description": "FOREX-Dollar on back foot after U.S. service sector survey fans recession worries", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA6K0IO_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
