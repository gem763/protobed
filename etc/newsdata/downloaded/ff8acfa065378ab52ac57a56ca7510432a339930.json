First, NBN Co was breaching its wholesale-only remit by cutting deals directly with Vocus's business clients. And second, even if it were not breaching this rule, its government backing gave it an unfair advantage over private sector competitors in an area where there was no market failure.\n\nHe gave particular attention to NBN Co's target rate of return of 3.2 per cent.\n\nRate of return\n\n\"When NBN is weighing up how much to invest in new enterprise fibre, its 3.2 per cent target rate of return is significantly lower than any private investor would find acceptable,\" he said.\n\nA Vocus spokeswoman said for a company like Vocus, a rate of return would need to be more than the cost of capital, which is around 10 per cent. Infrastructure investors, she said, were looking for upwards of 15 per cent.\n\nIn other words, commercial operators are looking for a good 10 percentage points more than the government-underwritten NBN.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Russell's speech amounted to a call for NBN Co to be banned from laying fibre for businesses in parts of the country plentifully served by private telcos. Instead, he said NBN Co should lay new fibre only for businesses in rural and regional areas not well served by the private sector.\n\nOn the first complaint, Mr Russell may get some results. The day before he made his speech, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission issued NBN Co with an official warning for breaching its obligation to treat all retailers equally, when it cut a favourable deal with Macquarie Telecom.\n\nBut his second complaint \u2013 that it's unfair for NBN Co to be competing in the enterprise market \u2013 is almost certain to gain no traction at all. The two authorities that matter on this, the federal government and the ACCC, are adamant that NBN Co is bringing much-needed competition to the enterprise market.\n\nACCC chairman Rod Sims told The Australian Financial Review that NBN Co's breach of impartiality rules, while a clear and serious breach, did not actually have any negative effect on the market, and that overall the NBN's presence in the market would boost competition.\n\nA lot of concern\n\n\u201cWhen the legislation was brought in in relation to NBN a long time ago, the concern by parliament \u2013 and there was a lot of concern \u2013 was that NBN would play the Telstra and do a cosy deal, dominant wholesaler with dominant retailer. So very strict provisions were put in place about what it could and couldn't do. We thought they were a bit too tightly worded, but nevertheless that is the law,\" he said.\n\n\"In our view the NBN has clearly breached the provisions, so we feel a warning notice was appropriate. But on the other hand really there was no harm, because they weren\u2019t in fact doing a deal with Telstra, they were doing a deal with Macquarie Telecom. So on one hand it was a clear breach, and we can't have [NBN Co] doing it again, on the other hand there was no impact on competition.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking on the same day, Communications Minister Paul Fletcher celebrated NBN Co's move into the enterprise sector, boasting of the major deals the company had signed to connect Woolworths, Coles and Australian Post.\n\nNBN Co itself was defiant in the face of Mr Russell's critique, and when asked to respond it took the opportunity to spruik its enterprise products: \"One of the key benefits of the NBN network is retail competition, as customers have a choice of retail service providers supplying services over the NBN network,\" a spokesman said.\n\nThere is a further reason why neither the government nor NBN Co itself will pull back. They need the money from the enterprise segment to ensure the $51 billion project pays for itself. The alternative would be a write-down, which would amount to the taxpayer taking a multibillion dollar hit. That, indirectly, is what people like Mr Russell and Telstra boss Andy Penn are calling for.\n\nAsked for its views on a write-down, the federal government was unequivocal.\n\n\"Those arguing for a write down in order to facilitate lower prices (and higher margins) for other businesses with commercial interests in this industry are essentially arguing that the taxpayer rather than customers should carry more of the cost burden of the services provided by NBN and accessed by NBN customers,\" Finance Minister Mathias Cormann told The Australian Financial Review.\n\n\"Taxpayers should be very concerned about any suggestion that any future government may make arbitrary political decisions to determine the value of its assets rather than decisions based on proper and rigorous methodology in accordance with accounting standards.\"\n\nCost to business\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiven NBN looks set to have a free run at the enterprise market, what should telco shareholders expect? By 2023, NBN Co expects to be taking around $1.2 billion a year in revenue from its enterprise operations, up from $400 million.\n\nTelstra chief executive Andy Penn has been candid about what this will mean for the telco giant. It was largely NBN Co's move into enterprise that prompted the firm in August to dial up its anticipated NBN-induced annual earnings hole from $3 billion to $3.4 billion by 2022. In other words, unless Telstra fills that hole, the NBN's move could cost shareholders as much as $400 million a year.\n\nStill, so far the impact of NBN Co's move is hard to detect in any of the telco's results. Telstra's revenue from its enterprise operations grew in 2019, albeit by 0.3 per cent, to $8.24 billion. But that was a similar level of growth to the previous year, before NBN had ramped up its enterprise operations.\n\nTPG also grew revenue from its enterprise business in 2019 by 4.6 per cent to $754 million. From that, it managed to grow enterpise earnings by 37.4 per cent. It achieved this, in the words of Morgans analyst Nick Harris, \"by doing what it does best, which is moving services onto its own networks to reduce third-party costs, and improve profitability\".\n\nBut like Vocus, whose core business is fixed-line fibre, TPG is more exposed than most.\n\nLike Telstra, TPG is hemorrhaging earnings on its consumer fixed-line business to the NBN. But unlike Telstra, which has put its future hopes in mobile, and particularly 5G, it doesn't have a lot of options outside fixed-line. Assuming the merger with Vodafone doesn't happen (which is a big assumption), and assuming boss David Teoh is true to his word and does not build a mobile network, TPG will be increasingly reliant on its enterprise business.\n\nChanged the market\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNigel Pugh, a telecoms analyst and managing director of Venture Insights, said NBN Co's move into enterprise had changed the market.\n\n\"I think it\u2019s a big deal for anyone that\u2019s got infrastructure in place,\" he said. \"You may have done an enterprise deal four years ago, which may involve putting fibre in place, and then four years later you're overbuilt by NBN. So that\u2019s going to have to affect on the value of that asset.\"\n\nHe echoed NBN Co's point that the separation of wholesaler and retailer made NBN an attractive prospect to businesses.\n\n\u201cIf you want to swap Vocus for Telstra it\u2019s a lot simpler because it\u2019s just a matter of switching retailer, not fibre.\u201d\n\nBut he agreed with Mr Russell's point that overbuilding \u2013 the laying of NBN fibre where other fibre already exists \u2013 was wasteful.\n\n\"There could be some sort of hybrid model where NBN leases fibre already in place rather than overbuild them,\" he said.", "description": "Telcos complain NBN is unfairly and unnecessarily competing in the enterprise market.
