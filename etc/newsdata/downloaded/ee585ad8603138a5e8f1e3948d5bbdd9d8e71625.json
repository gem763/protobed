REUTERS/Costas Baltas/File Photo\n\nWhile President Donald Trump is expected to attend the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Chile in mid-November, the most senior official from his administration who will be in Bangkok next week when Thailand hosts the annual East Asian Summit and U.S.-ASEAN Summit will be Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, the White House said in a statement.\n\nRoss is scheduled to lead the U.S. delegation to an Indo-Pacific Business Forum grouping government officials and business executives on the sidelines of the EAS.\n\nTrump, a Republican, has named White House national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien as his special envoy to the summits, the White House said.\n\nDavid Stilwell, the State Department\u2019s assistant secretary for East Asia and the Pacific, will also be in Bangkok, but the U.S. delegation will be significantly outranked by other regional players including, Japan, India and China.\n\nDespite declaring Indo-Pacific \u201cthe single most consequential region for America\u2019s future\u201d in a Pentagon strategy report this year, the Trump administration has steadily scaled back U.S. presence at the EAS and ASEAN gatherings.\n\nWhile Trump attended the U.S.-ASEAN summit in Manila in 2017, he has never attended a full EAS meeting. Vice President Mike Pence represented the United States at the meetings in Singapore last year.\n\nTrump\u2019s predecessor, Democrat Barack Obama, by contrast attended every U.S.-ASEAN and East Asia summit from 2011, apart from 2013, when he canceled due to a government shutdown at home.\n\nAsian diplomats say the lack of top-level U.S. representation in Bangkok will be a significant if not unexpected disappointment in a region increasingly concerned about China\u2019s fast-expanding influence.\n\nTrump plans to attend the primarily economics-focused meeting of APEC in Chile, where he has said he hopes to sign the first part of a deal with China to resolve a prolonged and damaging trade war.\n\nHowever, diplomats and analysts say Trump\u2019s absence in Bangkok will raise questions about U.S. commitment to the region, especially after his withdrawal from the 11-nation Trans Pacific Partnership trade agreement in 2017, shortly after he took office.\n\nLast year, Trump, who is currently embroiled in a congressional impeachment inquiry, sent Pence in his place to attend APEC as well as the ASEAN and the East Asia summits.\n\nMatthew Goodman, senior adviser for Asian economics at Washington\u2019s Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, called U.S. attendance plans for Bangkok \u201ca real issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs Woody Allen said, either 80 or 85 percent of life is showing up. And in the Indo-Pacific, that\u2019s definitely true,\u201d he told a news briefing previewing the summits. \u201cIf you show up, you\u2019re given praise, whatever you actually say or do. If you don\u2019t show up, it\u2019s a real problem.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nAmy Searight, who was a senior defense official under Obama and is now a senior adviser at CSIS, said the EAS summit had become the premier strategic dialogue forum for the Asia Pacific, drawing leaders from China, India, Japan and South Korea, as well as those of the 10 ASEAN, or Association of Southeast Asian Nations, states.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be headlines in the region that no senior American leader is coming to a summit with 17 other leaders from the Indo-Pacific,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAnd I think it really does call into question ... how serious this administration is in its Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it really just calls into question the reliability of the United States as a strategic partner to this region.\u201d", "description": "The United States has downgraded its participation in back-to-back Asia-Pacific summits in Bangkok next week, a move bound to disappoint Asian partners worried by China's expanding influence.", "authors": ["David Brunnstrom", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446361472&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T02F", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
