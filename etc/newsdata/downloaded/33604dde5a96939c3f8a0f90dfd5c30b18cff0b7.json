Then the Baylor sexual assault scandal happened, coach Art Briles was fired and the program was turned upside down by investigations. Duvernay opted out of Waco and landed in Austin.\n\nDuvernay doesn\u2019t talk much about the decisions that led him to Texas. But 3 \u00bd seasons and 115 catches later, he has gone from the third option in the passing game to Sam Ehlinger\u2019s No. 1 target this season. It has all proven that the senior made all the right moves for both himself and the No. 11 Longhorns (4-1, 2-0 Big 12).\n\nDuvernay leads the nation with nine receptions per game, and his 45 catches this season are six more than Texas\u2019 next three receivers combined heading into Saturday\u2019s Big 12 showdown with No. 6 Oklahoma (5-0, 2-0) in Dallas.\n\nLong known for his speed and sticky hands, his knack of wiggling into open spaces to convert third downs has been uncanny. And his ability to use his 5-foot-11, 210-pound frame to punish tacklers has been a revelation.\n\n\u201cThe anger that he runs with when he has the ball in his hands and his physicality is just so impressive,\u201d Texas coach Tom Herman said.\n\nIt took some struggles to get to this point.\n\nDuvernay was one of the top recruits in the country coming out of high school and seemed like a perfect fit for the Baylor offense and its deep-strike playmakers at wide receiver. The Baylor scandal erupted with Briles getting fired just before Duvernay and his brother Donovan, a defensive back, were ready to move to campus.\n\nWith Baylor in a meltdown, the family wanted out of Waco. Duvernay got a big break when he learned Baylor had never formally filed his signing paperwork with the Big 12. He was effectively declared a free agent and it was Texas that won the new recruiting battle for the player everyone wanted.\n\nThen-coach Charlie Strong lured Duvernay with his new offense, which looked a lot like Baylor\u2019s old one.\n\n\u201cI wanted to find somewhere I felt comfortable,\u201d Duvernay said this week. \u201cI had a special relationship with that staff (Briles) and those guys. Losing that and not knowing what to do was difficult. Meeting with coach Strong and the staff, I just felt like this is the place I want to be.\u201d\n\nAs a freshman, he caught 20 passes and three touchdowns that covered 63, 75 and 80 yards. The first one, a play he still considers a special moment, came against Oklahoma. But Strong was fired at season\u2019s end. Herman came in and the offense changed - and so did Duvernay\u2019s role. He had just nine catches and no touchdowns in 13 games in 2017. Duvernay calls that a \u201cdifficult\u201d time.\n\n\u201cI had some things I needed to work on to become a better player,\u201d he said. \u201cRun routes better. Become a better blocker.\u201d\n\nBy 2018, he had 41 catches and four touchdowns. But the Texas coaching staff still saw untapped potential.\n\nOn the day Texas reported to training camp in August, the coaches pitched a move from the outside to the inside. He\u2019d be closer to the ball and running routes into the heart of the defense.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m all in,\u201d Duvernay said.\n\nThe connection with Ehlinger has clicked from the start.\n\n\u201cThe transformation for him from outside receiver to slot has been great,\u201d Ehlinger said. \u201cThis is his last year, so he\u2019s taken it as a personal challenge.\u201d\n\nDuvernay\u2019s breakout came in Texas\u2019 45-38 loss to LSU. He had 12 catches for 154 yards and two TDs. His 44-yard score on a fourth down in the fourth quarter saw him take a short pass and burst through a gap between two defenders before they could close it.\n\nHe followed that with another 12-catch game in a win over Oklahoma State. Of his 15 catches on third down, 13 have picked up a first down. He\u2019s now on the watch list for the Biletnikoff Award given to college football\u2019s top receiver.\n\nTexas will even use Duvernay as a running back. He lined up with Ehlinger in the backfield and took a handoff 13 yards for a touchdown against West Virginia.\n\n\u201cDuv is kind of an all-everything guy for us now,\u201d Herman said. \u201cWhen he gets in the open field, if he gets a crease his acceleration is elite.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "It seems like ages ago when Texas receiver Devin Duvernay was supposed to be - wanted to be - a Baylor Bear.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jim Vertuno"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/09/texas_duvernays_rise_football_41437_c0-166-3967-2478_s1770x1032.jpg?7198caaee02e0a5f1883ee247ffb6d7d0c909d8a", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
