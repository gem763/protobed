It\u2019s a final and that\u2019s something you have to front up to.\n\n\u201cLike Eddie has mentioned, they have many different threats and one is their forward pack.\u201d\n\nBilly Vunipola has been part of a formidable England pack in Japan (David Davies/PA)\n\nEngland have said throughout the tournament that they want to defend with \u201cbrutality\u201d and so far they have been good to their word.\n\nThe most ferocious hits of the World Cup were delivered by Sam Underhill, who smashed All Blacks Kieran Read and Jordie Barrett backwards with momentum shifting tackles.\n\n\u201cWhen coaches throw words like brutality at you, you kind of have to back it up and we have been challenged again to bring the same intensity against South Africa,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe value of a big tackle is something that you probably can\u2019t measure, but the best way to explain it is that it\u2019s quite contagious.\n\n\u201cIt shows everyone it can be done, so everyone else tries to follow in the slipstream of players like Underhill, Tom Curry and Maro Itoje.\n\n\u201cA lot of people talk about it and it\u2019s easy to sit here and say we want to be brutal, but you have to back those words up and those guys are probably the best at leading that area.\u201d\n\nBilly Vunipola will come face to face with South Africa\u00b4s Duane Vermeulen (right) again this weekend (David Davies/PA)\n\nVunipola will resume his personal duel with South Africa back row Duane Vermeulen who made a major impact on his return to Test rugby during last summer\u2019s 2-1 series victory over England.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve played against them a few times and he\u2019s got up the last few times so personally I\u2019m going to try my best to win that little battle so to speak and hopefully that will help the team,\u201d Vunipola said.\n\n\u201cI played against him last summer and he was monumental in terms of getting them those two victories.\u201d", "description": "The two nations meet on Saturday in a repeat of the 2007 World Cup final.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/16/wire-20335066-1572365984-518_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
