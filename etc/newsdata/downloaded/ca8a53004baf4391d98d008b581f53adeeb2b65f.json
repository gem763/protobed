(Heidi Levine/AP)\n\nWeary voters across Israel headed to the polls for the second time in five months Tuesday in a do-over election that has largely become a referendum on the future of embattled Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the country\u2019s longest-serving leader and a masterful political survivalist.\n\nThe back-to-back elections cap a season of political deadlock in an increasingly polarized society, with voters migrating to evermore distant right and left, religious and secular camps and politicians struggling to build coalitions that can govern.\n\nAt the center is Netanyahu, a campaign magician who managed to conjure the unprecedented second vote after falling one Knesset seat short of forming a government after April\u2019s election.\n\nAmid the dizzying kaleidoscope of small parties and shifting alliances that make up Israel\u2019s political universe, voters today are essentially choosing between a right-wing religious coalition led by Netanyahu or a secular-centrist government led by his chief rival, former military chief, Benny Gantz.\n\nThe final polls before voting began showed the race in nearly a dead heat, or slightly favoring Netanyahu\u2019s ruling Likud party. Neither candidate is likely to get an outright majority of the 120 Knesset seats up for grabs, meaning that Tuesday\u2019s vote will be followed by a period of deal making with other parties. A final outcome may not be clear for weeks.\n\nAnalysts were unsure how the unusual second election, largely unfolding over the summer holidays, would impact voter turnout, which typically nears 70 percent here. Public transport is free on election day and many workers get the day off.\n\nIn the Jerusalem suburb of Mevasseret Zion, polling stations were full by midmorning.\n\n\n\nAn Israeli man casts his ballot during Israel's parliamentary election at a polling station in Tel Aviv on Sept. 17, 2019. (Gil Cohen-Magen/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nYaakov Elbaz, 71, said that he intended vote in opposition of Netanyahu.\n\n\u201cOur country is not in the best place right now,\u201d Elbaz said. \u201cOn one side we have a prime minister that is doing shady deals just to help himself and on the other side we have the ultra-Orthodox who are trying to change the very nature of our society.\u201d\n\nWaiting to vote with a gaggle of small children surrounding him, a 37-year-voter said he was most concerned about security in the region. \u201cToday is one of the most defining elections,\u201d said Haim, who declined to give his last name. \u201cThe situation in Israel, in the Middle East and in the world is unstable and we need to have a strong leader leading the country.\u201d\n\nBut even as he entered into the polling station, he said he was unsure whether he would vote for Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party or Yamina, a union of ultraright wing parties.\n\nIf Netanyahu emerges with enough support, he will be in a strong position to forge agreements with allies on the right and with leaders of Israeli\u2019s influential ultrareligious factions. He may also find a way to use the shield of official immunity to fend off an impending indictment in three criminal cases involving bribery, corruption and breach of trust.\n\nIf he loses votes, however, either to Gantz\u2019s Blue and White party, or a significant number of mandates to factions further to his right, Israel could have a new prime minister for the first time in a decade. Netanyahu, who also held office for three years in the late 1990s, last June surpassed the country\u2019s founder David Ben Gurion as the longest serving prime minister.\n\n\u201cIt is never safe to bet on Netanyahu\u2019s end,\u201d said Emmanuel Navon, a senior fellow at the Jerusalem-based Kohelet Policy Forum. \u201cHe has been prime minister for 13 years and there is an endless list of predictions that this or that would bring him down but, in the end, he always comes around.\u201d\n\nThe possible results, at least according to most opinion polls, have left analysts and close observers of Israeli politics scratching their heads. Surveys taken ahead of the weekend showed Netanyahu\u2019s Likud running slightly ahead of Blue and White, but as with the results last time, neither the right or left bloc will have enough votes to form a government.\n\n[Netanyahu advises supporters that voting is more important than sex]\n\nBased on a system of proportional representation, each party receives a share of parliamentary seats according to the number of votes cast for them nationally. Throughout the country\u2019s history, no party has ever won an outright majority and it falls to the largely ceremonial president to task the leader with most recommendations from other parties to forge a coalition of at least 61 seats.\n\nOpinion polls taken Thursday indicate that Netanyahu and his likely allies on the religious right will reach only 57-59 seats. The center and left-wing parties will draw less than 45. A group of ideologically varied Arab parties could also draw significant votes, although those parties traditionally refuse to participate in governing coalitions.\n\nThat could leave, for the second time, the balance of power in the hands of a secular nationalist party led by the stone-faced former immigrant Avigdor Liberman. In April, Liberman scuttled Netanyahu\u2019s narrow election victory when he refused to join a coalition that included the ultra-Orthodox. Netanyahu was forced to call for a do-over vote, thrusting the secular-religious issues that have longed bubbled under the surface of Israeli society to the fore.\n\nLiberman is predicted to draw up to 10 seats, double his number from last time. Once again, he could hold the seats that would enable Netanyahu to form right-religious government. But he promised during the campaign seek a broad secular coalition led by either Blue and White or by a Likud with someone other than Netanyahu in charge.\n\n\u201cThe Likud party may have to decide whether holding onto power is more important to holding onto Netanyahu,\u201d said Reuven Hazan, a professor of political science at Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\n\n\n\nUltra-Orthodox Jewish men help an elderly man cast his ballot as Israelis vote in a parliamentary election, at a polling station in Jerusalem's Mea Shearim neighborhood Sep. 17, 2019. (Ammar Awad/Reuters)\n\nAlso unknown is how many of Netanyahu\u2019s supporters will go out for the second time to vote for him. In days leading up to the Tuesday\u2019s vote, he has beseeched Likud voters not to take his victory for granted. In a blitz of media interviews over the weekend, and in a final round of short, snappy campaign videos, he warned of a left-wing victory, likely fraud by Arab voters and complacency by his own party.\n\nVoter turnout is generally high in Israel, although it varies by sector. The ultra-Orthodox community, about 10 percent of the population, has the highest numbers, while it is lower in the more mainstream, secular sectors of society. Among Israel\u2019s Arab population, about 20 percent of the general electorate, the numbers are much lower, dropping to less than 50 percent in April.\n\nWith this redo election coming so close after the previous one, and coming at the end of a hot, lazy summer vacation, all of the battling politicians across the spectrum are concerned that voter lethargy could have a significant impact on the results.\n\n\u201cNetanyahu is extremely competent at increasing the turnout of his political base, he did it in 2015 and in the first election in April, he is trying to do it now as well,\u201d said Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute.\n\nPlesner said the results of the election could change dramatically depending on the voter turnout in certain sectors of Israeli society.\n\n\u201cIf the Arab voters increase, it really could change the final outcome,\u201d he said.\n\nAmid the uncertainly, some voters said their greatest fear was that yet another election would be needed. Netanyahu, for his part, has refused to rule out a third vote. But in a video message Tuesday morning, President Reuven Rivlin, who could likely find himself the peacemaker in another stalemate scenario, said he would \u201cdo everything I can to get an elected government in Israel as soon as possible and to avoid another election campaign.\u201d\n\nSteve Hendrix in Jerusalem contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\nIn Israeli election, a nation votes but one man could decide\n\nIsrael\u2019s do-over election this month may yield another deadlock.
