The parallels between market and economic conditions today and last fall are heightening the anxiety of many money managers.\n\nThe S&P 500 is within 2% of July\u2019s all-time high and is holding on to a 19% gain for the year, outperforming the Stoxx Europe 600, Japan\u2019s Nikkei Stock Average, MSCI Emerging Markets Index and Germany\u2019s DAX. Yet many money managers are questioning whether the index can maintain its gains the rest of the year, citing memories of 2018, when the S&P 500 peaked in late September, only to tumble almost 20% over the following three months.\n\nMoney managers are veering away from companies vulnerable to escalation in the U.S.-China trade war.

Making matters worse, the manufacturing malaise that showed signs of spreading in Europe and Asia in late 2018 has started to materialize in the U.S., with Institute for Supply Management data on Tuesday showing the manufacturing sector shrank in August for the first time in three years.\n\nEstimates for corporate profits, which took a sharp hit last fall, are declining by the week: FactSet figures suggest earnings of S&P 500 companies are in the midst of their longest streak of contraction since 2016.\n\nSigns of strength among consumers and in the services sector have helped investors brush off talk of an imminent recession for now. Labor Department data Friday showed the U.S. extended a record 107-month streak of job creation, while a report Thursday showed the service sector grew for the 115th consecutive month.\n\nBut even those who believe the decadelong bull market still has legs say their optimism has faded materially since the start of the year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been extremely bullish the last six years, and this is the most cautious I\u2019ve been in quite a long time,\u201d said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse.\n\n\u201c[It\u2019s] not that I\u2019m calling for the market to correct in a major way, and not that I\u2019m calling for a recession, but I do see a deceleration in the underlying data that I think is an impediment to the market going forward,\u201d he said.\n\nStocks had rallied earlier in the year as investors bet on central banks loosening monetary policy. But markets appear to have gotten less of a boost from central banks lately as investors have worried about the economic outlook darkening despite policy makers\u2019 moves. The European Central Bank is expected to unveil a package of stimulus measures at its policy meeting this week, while the Federal Reserve is expected to lower interest rates at the conclusion of its meeting the week after.\n\nMoney managers are veering away from shares of companies that look vulnerable to further escalation in the U.S.-China trade war.\n\nRebecca Felton, senior portfolio manager and chief risk officer at RiverFront Investment Group, says her firm has shied away from semiconductor stocks even as it has purchased shares of other types of technology companies.\n\n\u201cThe trade overhang is such a big factor,\u201d Ms. Felton said. She added that with major stock indexes already up double-digit percentages in 2019 and markets headed for a \u201cseasonally tricky\u201d period, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if investors were generally reluctant to add to their holdings of risky assets in the final months of the year.\n\nSome believe the market is ripe for an even sharper pullback in the coming months. Oliver Jones, senior markets economist at Capital Economics, believes the S&P 500 will have a \u201csizable fall\u201d before the end of the year.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to believe a recession is on the corner to believe earnings estimates have to come down quite a bit more,\u201d Mr. Jones said, adding that assumptions that earnings growth will rebound in 2020 look overly optimistic.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nCurrently, analysts are projecting S&P 500 earnings in 2020 will rise 8.1% in the first quarter and 9.2% in the second quarter\u2014a jump from the pace of projected growth throughout 2019.\n\nPart of the reason some investors are having difficulty accepting rosy 2020 estimates is that bond yields have continued their 2019 slump, behaving in ways that have historically signaled a recession is coming. The three-month Treasury yield, for instance, has exceeded the 10-year Treasury yield for much of the past couple of months.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Are you making any changes to your portfolio in expectation of a market downturn? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n\nBut not all investors see the drop in bond yields as a reason to sour on stocks.\n\n\u201cThe lower interest rates are, the more exciting it becomes to own equities in the long term,\u201d said Dev Kantesaria, a portfolio manager and founder of equity hedge fund Valley Forge Capital. He said he believes investors\u2019 search for yield will help keep U.S. stock prices higher.\n\nLike Ms. Felton, Mr. Kantesaria has tried to steer money away from industries that rely heavily on manufacturing or trade in Asia, instead investing in shares of companies involved in software, payment processing and information technology.\n\n\u201cThe trade turmoil continues, but the average S&P 500 company is very attractive at these valuations,\u201d he said.\n\nTo receive our Markets newsletter every morning in your inbox, click here.\n\nWrite to Akane Otani at akane.otani@wsj.com", "description": "Stocks have raced higher to start September, but signs of faltering growth are keeping investors on edge as they navigate what historically has been a turbulent period for markets.", "authors": ["Akane Otani", "Akane.Otani Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104839/social", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
