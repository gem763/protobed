USA TODAY\n\nWhen Fitbit\u2019s inaugural tracker helped catapult us into the age of the wearable a decade ago, there wasn\u2019t even an app for that.\n\nHard to blame Fitbit, really. Android and iOS smartphones made up only about 3% of the mobile market at the time. Instead, the wearable pioneer\u2019s first tracker, which began shipping 10 years ago Sunday, connected to Fitbit\u2019s online dashboard via a charging dock that plugged into a PC's USB socket for power and connectivity.\n\nThe Fitbit Classic, as the company now calls it, clipped to a piece of clothing. And by virtue of its built-in motion sensor, the tracker played a major role in cultivating the nation\u2019s obsession with step counts as a proxy for physical activity and, to a lesser degree, the lack thereof as a sleep gauge.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a fun 10 years,\u201d James Park, Fitbit\u2019s CEO and Co-founder, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to think that when we started, the state of the art was what we developed: an accelerometer-based activity and sleep-tracking device. And now we\u2019ve come to a world where these are almost smartphones on your wrist.\n\n\u201cYou have an array of sensors, and interactive screens and microphones \u2013 and in a size that\u2019s pretty close to the original device we developed. The evolution is just amazing to me.\u201d\n\nJames Park, entrepreneur, founder and CEO created a device called a Fitbit, a tiny \"personal wellness\" device that tracks the wearer's intensity and duration of exercise and daily activities including calories burned, steps taken, distance covered and even sleep quality.

The ongoing melding of fitness trackers and smartwatches not only offers up a vast trove of fitness- and health-related data that dwarfs what Fitbit delivered a decade ago. The latest devices also boast a suite of calendar and news alerts, voicemail and text messages, directions \u2013 even Uber rides and OpenTable reservations. Indeed, whatever it is you seek, chances are there\u2019s also a smartwatch app for that.\n\nThe more things change\u2026\n\nAdvanced heart rate and environmental sensors have given the smartphone-on-a-wrist power to measure much more \u2013 everything from sleep stages to stress levels. And yet, counting steps curiously maintains its place on center stage.\n\nIt\u2019s not totally without merit. Research has both validated and advanced the role of step-counting in tracking and improving our health. We now know, for example, that it\u2019s better for our bodies to log activity each hour than to bowl through 10,000 steps before work and then sit staring at a computer for four hours.\n\nGoogle watch, Fitbit, hearables: How big will the wearable tech industry become?\n\nFitbit Versa 2: Three reasons you might want to get this smartwatch\n\nEven so, as we enter the second decade of the wearables phenomenon, the outsized role of this anachronistic proxy for fitness is in some ways emblematic of Silicon Valley\u2019s all-too-eager penchant for measuring and reporting \u2013 and, perhaps more significantly \u2013 its struggle to deliver cogent, actionable insights from the data it collects.\n\nCertainly, we\u2019ve seen some progress in the insight wearables deliver, particularly over the past two or three years. Fitbit, for example, just added a Sleep Score to help assess whether 45 minutes of REM and 32 minutes of deep sleep during a seven-hour, 25-minute slumber amounts to a quality showing. And the Apple Watch Series 4 and 5 devices have built-in ECG that helps decide whether to get examined by a clinician.\n\n'It saved my life': Apple Watch, Fitbit are notifying users of medical emergencies\n\nEven so, we are still a very long way from wearables realizing the potential benefits from the data they already collect.\n\nCLOSE A Fitbit helped one woman detect a life-threatening condition. Buzz60 Emily Drooby (@emilydrooby) has the story. Buzz60\n\nWhat tomorrow may bring\n\nWith that as a backdrop, it should be clear that the next 10 years will be as much about bringing new metrics to wearables as delivering new insights from the metrics the devices already collect.\n\nHere are three other things I\u2019m expecting from wearables in coming years:\n\nBlood Pressure: First, the good news: blood pressure will be the next decade\u2019s monster wearables metric. It has the potential to dramatically advance detection and care for the more than 100 million Americans with hypertension. And we\u2019ll begin to see it available in wearables in as little as 12 to 18 months.\n\nThe bad news? This powerful new metric won\u2019t be available on smartwatches or fitness trackers for a very long time. Watch for hearables to be the first consumer devices to measure blood pressure. Smart rings and finger cuffs won\u2019t be far behind.\n\nPairables: As you might infer, wrists, fingers and ears each present wearables makers very different opportunities and challenges.\n\nThe wrist is a great spot to strap a display, a full suite of sensors and a sizeable battery to power them. But the wrist moves every which way, which makes it one of the most confounding sites on the body to collect biometrics.\n\nThe ear, conversely, is one of the best spots. The finger isn\u2019t too bad \u2013 and rings are much easier to wear overnight for sleep tracking than earbuds.\n\nAll of this is to say that wearables makers will need to offer what I\u2019m calling pairables: a set of two or three devices that work together to collect the best metrics and squeeze every ounce of insight out of them.\n\nAnd the third prediction? Ten years from now, we\u2019ll still be logging steps.
