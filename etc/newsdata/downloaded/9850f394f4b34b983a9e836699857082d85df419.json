I\u2019m all about reinvention \u2013 I\u2019m all about trying new things and improving myself in different ways.\n\n\u2018I really want to surprise people so I\u2019m working hard and practising a lot.\u2019\n\nWho is on the X Factor Celebrity tonight?\n\nMegan McKenna \u2013 no stranger to reality TV after making her name on The Only Way Is Essex \u2013 is one of the wannabe singers taking part.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother soap star, Jonny Labey, who is the youngest solo contestant, will be appearing along with Olivia Olson, who sang in rom-com classic Love Actually, and Coronation Street\u2019s Victoria Ekanoye.\n\nTOWIE\u2019s Megan McKenna will be going for a song in the show (Picture: Rex)\n\nV5 \u2013 a quintet of social media influencers \u2013 will compete, as well as Coronation Street\u2019s Victoria Ekanoye.\n\nThe X Factor: Celebrity is on ITV tonight at 8.35pm.\n\nMORE: Ricki Lake found X Factor Celebrity a hard watch after losing 20lbs since first audition: \u2018It\u2019s hard to see myself\u2019\n\nMORE: Love Island\u2019s Samira Mighty calls X Factor: Celebrity \u2018surreal\u2019 as she auditioned years ago\n\nMORE: Olivia Olson is breaking free from the shackles of Love Actually on X Factor Celebrity: \u2018I refuse to sing Mariah Carey\u2019", "description": "From Megan McKenna to Olivia Olson, here's who's appearing on X Factor: Celebrity tonight.", "authors": ["Ben Miller"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_89413119_1571500656.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
