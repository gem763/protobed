Even if you earn less, you're still earning something.\n\nHere are some tips to help grow your nest egg:\n\nPut less in your checking account\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor your monthly bills, try keeping only one to two months of spending requirements in your checking account, Sweeney urged.\n\n\u201cYou will earn very little on these funds so try to keep a small buffer -- so you don\u2019t bounce checks -- and replenish your account with earnings each month as you spend,\u201d Sweeney said.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s interest rate cut won\u2019t benefit savers.\n\nStart an emergency fund now if you don\u2019t already have one\n\nBulk up on saving for a rainy day. People should have at least six months worth of living expenses in a liquid account so they can withdraw money without a penalty if needed.\n\n\u201cEveryone gets a flat tire or breaks their glasses, and you need to spend money to get back on track that is outside of your normal monthly expenditures. People should look for savings accounts that are liquid and offer a high interest rate,\u201d Sweeney suggested, advising consumers not only to shop for the best return but to keep an eye on it to make sure it stays competitive.\n\nTrack 'excess cash' in your retirement account\n\nIt\u2019s important to be conscious of any extra money you might have in a retirement account or any other savings accounts that should be invested for the long-term.\n\n\u201cEnsure that regular deposits into retirement accounts go straight into long-term funds that align with your time horizon and risk tolerance,\u201d Sweeney said.\n\nDon\u2019t alter long-term savings goals\n\nDon\u2019t let a change in interest rates alter your long-term investment goals. If you\u2019re planning to buy a home, and you\u2019ve saved up enough money to do it, don\u2019t stress about a short-term change in rates.\n\n\u201cDo shop to find a competitive rate, with a convenient and pleasant borrowing experience, but don\u2019t forgo a decision to buy a house because mortgage rates climbed last week,\u201d Sweeney suggested.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Even if you earn less during a low interest-rate period, you're still earning something.", "authors": ["Jeanette Settembre"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/senior-protecting-his-savings-piggy-2f55be94a7a0b510VgnVCM100000d7c1a8c0____-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
