The official report into the Grenfell fire has concluded fewer people would have died if the London Fire Brigade had not suffered \"serious shortcomings\" and \"systemic\" failures in its response. It accuses London Fire Brigade commissioner Dany Cotton of \"remarkable insensitivity\" after she gave testimony insisting she would have done nothing differently. Relatives are angry that Ms Cotton is being allowed to retire next year aged 50 on a full pension estimated to be worth as much as \u00a32million. The report will now increase demands by victims' families for the fire brigade to be prosecuted for corporate manslaughter. As Chief Reporter Robert Mendick writes, inquiry chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick makes 46 recommendations after his investigation into the blaze at the west London tower block that left 72 people dead in June 2017.\n\nThe damning 1,000-page document - seen by The Telegraph - appeared to ease fears of a whitewash among those touched by the tragedy. Dozens of survivors and grieving relatives were handed the report, which weighs around 4kg, yesterday to allow them to digest the findings ahead of the formal publication tomorrow. From the cause of the fire to the response inside the brigade control room, Jack Hardy examines the findings section by section.", "description": "If you want to receive twice-daily briefings like this by email, sign up to the Front Page newsletter here and try our Audio Briefings on WhatsApp.", "authors": ["Danny Boyle", "Sherelle Jacobs", "Charles Moore", "Telegraph View", "William Hague"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/09/TELEMMGLPICT000163780676-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
