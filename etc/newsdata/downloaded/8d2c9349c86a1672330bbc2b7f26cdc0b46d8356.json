Both measures have been condemned by the UN previously.\n\n\u201cI encourage Australia to make greater use of human rights-compliant alternatives to detention, which are non-custodial and community-based,\u201d Bachelet said.\n\nHer comments came after conservative Prime Minister Scott Morrison last week used a major foreign policy speech in Sydney to decry international institutions that he said \u201cdemand conformity rather than independent cooperation on global issues\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe should avoid any reflex towards a negative globalism that coercively seeks to impose a mandate from an often ill-defined borderless global community,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd worse still, an unaccountable internationalist bureaucracy.\u201d\n\nMorrison went on to declare that the government \u201ccan never answer to a higher authority than the people of Australia\u201d.\n\nThe comments have widely been interpreted as a swipe at the UN.\n\nBachelet did not address the prime minister\u2019s statements directly, instead rebuking Australian commentators who suggest \u201cthe UN human rights machinery should focus its attention elsewhere\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis scrutiny is not the function of some international policing system enforcing rules from outside,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt is based on international standards that Australia has helped to create, which successive Australian governments have voluntarily adopted.\u201d\n\nBachelet also called on Australia to enshrine comprehensive human rights protections in law and introduce constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, two proposals that have been the subject of much debate Down Under.", "description": "Sydney (AFP) \u2013 The UN\u2019s top rights official urged Australia to reform its criminal and refugee detention systems on Tuesday, just days after", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/07/9c5c86_un-human-rights-high-commissioner-michelle-bachelet-urged-australia-reform-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
