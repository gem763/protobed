Normally Congress would just hand the executive branch a bunch of money for the event and the president would handle the arrangements, including the choice of locale, right? Is Pelosi suggesting that some sort of condition will be attached to the appropriation barring it from being used at a Trump property?\n\nIf so, that\u2019ll set us up for a fun news cycle next year when Trump decides to ignore that condition and hands the money to Trump National Doral anyway.\n\nSilver lining, I guess: If Pelosi succeeds in roadblocking funding for the G7, Dems can\u2019t impeach Trump on emolument grounds for awarding himself the event.\n\nAsked about Trump holding the G7 at Doral, Pelosi says: \u201cThat\u2019s completely out of the question.\u201d \u2014 Manu Raju (@mkraju) October 18, 2019\n\nShe hit Trump for his G7 choice last night on Twitter too, citing Andrew Napolitano\u2019s segment on Fox Business to support her case. At long last \u2014 Fox/Pelosi synergy. Fox isn\u2019t the only Rupert Murdoch property that\u2019s criticizing Trump today for awarding himself a no-bid contract, either. The New York Post has an editorial out titled, \u201cMove the summit, Mr. President.\u201d (\u201c[V]oters expect and deserve clear signs that their president is working for them \u2014 not promoting himself.\u201d) I think he will end up moving it. The grief he\u2019s getting and will continue to get for it over the next eight months just isn\u2019t worth it to him.\n\nBut it\u2019s worth something. WaPo looked at Trump National Doral\u2019s business fortunes over the last few years and realized why Trump is keen to drum up some interest in the property.\n\nThe summit will also come to Doral at a particularly good time \u2014 June, when Miami is steamy and its business usually drops off sharply. In 2017, the hotel reported that June was its second-slowest month, with just 38.3 percent of its rooms occupied. Only August, at 31.1 percent, was slower\u2026 \u201cThey are severely underperforming\u201d other resorts in the area, tax consultant Jessica Vachiratevanurak, who had been hired by Trump, told a county official last year in a bid to lower the property\u2019s tax bill. Vachiratevanurak said the club\u2019s net operating income \u2014 a key figure, representing the amount left over after expenses are paid \u2014 had fallen by 69 percent as of 2017\u2026 In recent years, Doral has turned to Trump\u2019s political allies to replace some of its lost revenue. This past weekend, for instance, it hosted a pro-Trump group called American Priority. Shown at that event was a violent video depicting Trump shooting, stabbing and beheading members of the media and some Democratic opponents, according to the New York Times.\n\nTimes are tough for the business, probably due to some patrons disassociating themselves from Trump for political reasons, so logically the resort has tried to leverage Trump\u2019s political allies to offset the losses. Hosting the G7 is just a grander international version of that strategy. Ideally for Trump, the prestige associated with the event will wear off some of the resort\u2019s stigma among anti-Trump Americans and the Doral\u2019s bookings will increase afterward. Unless Pelosi blocks it, of course.\n\nBut maybe Trump isn\u2019t fully committed to the idea. The mayor of Doral told WaPo that he hadn\u2019t a word about this until Mick Mulvaney mentioned it on television, never mind that accommodating thousands of guests and security details for many world leaders will be a logistical challenge for the city. Possibly Trump sent Mulvaney out there to announce it as a trial balloon, to see what sort of pushback he\u2019d get. If people rolled their eyes but otherwise ignored it on grounds that it\u2019s just another case of the president being grubby, full speed ahead. Time to call the mayor. If instead there was an outcry, which there has been, he\u2019ll scrap it. I think he\u2019ll scrap it.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s also possible that Trump has (or had) every intention of hosting it at Doral and just didn\u2019t think to let city officials know. Why not surprise \u2019em later?\n\nHe\u2019s gonna scrap it. If a Trump buddy like Geraldo is willing to go on the president\u2019s very favorite news show on his very favorite network to criticize him over his decision, Trump will recalculate.", "description": "Threats.", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/p-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
