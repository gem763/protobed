The app is available globally on iOS and Android. Business Insider Intelligence\n\nThe app has immediately drawn comparisons with rival social app Snapchat, which Instagram has successfully copied before when it launched its Stories format across its family of apps. Although Snapchat reaches 90% of 13- to 24-year-olds in the US, Instagram usage is likely on par: Instagram is cited as the most-used social platform among teens, per Piper Jaffray.\n\nIf Instagram copies Snapchat effectively enough with Threads \u2014 or improves on it \u2014 it could siphon usage away from the app. As of now, time spent on Snapchat and Instagram are now about neck-and-neck in the US: Instagram users spend about 268 minutes on average per month, while Snapchat users spend about 264 minutes per month, as of August 2019, per Comscore.\n\nHere are the key elements of the app, which appear to be almost directly cribbed from Snapchat's design:\n\nThe app opens directly to the camera. In 2016, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel rebranded Snapchat as a \"camera company\"\u2014 not because the company will build itself around hardware \u2014 but based on the premise that the future of digital communication will prioritize images and not text. Accordingly, Snapchat opens directly to a camera. For its part, Instagram is image-based and enables sharing with a built-in camera, but stops short of prioritizing the camera in the way Threads does.\n\nThreads enables private messaging among a small group of friends. Last year, Instagram launched a feature called \"Close Friends\" that allowed users to share specific Stories with customized lists of friends, rather than with all followers. Threads has a dedicated inbox \u2014 similar to Snapchat's friends page \u2014 where users will get message notifications for conversations with Close Friends. More intimate messaging could encourage higher engagement, as users might feel safer and freer to communicate openly, something CEO Mark Zuckerberg noted at Facebook's F8 conference this year.\n\nThreads emphasizes ongoing connection with friends throughout the day. It's likely that Snapchat's focus on private messaging among small, tight-knit groups has encouraged deeper, higher-frequency engagement: The vast majority (71%) of US Snapchat users say they open the app multiple times per day, per Pew Research, and ahead of its IPO in 2017, Snapchat's CSO said that the average Snapchat user opens the app 18 times per day. In the same way, Threads is built around encouraging \"persistent connection,\" according to Instagram director of consumer product management Robby Stein. Threads could also encourage that behavior through its opt-in feature called Auto Status, which will allow users to share where they are, based on location data, though locations will be non-specific: For example, a user's status could simply say they're \"at the beach.\"\n\nThreads aligns seamlessly with Facebook's stated privacy focus and will likely inherit more elements of the so-called privacy \"pillars\" Facebook staked out earlier this year.Facebook's privacy push is genius in that it not only theorizes an improved experience for users, which can drive deeper engagement and rejuvenate relevance among young people, but it also protects the social giant from liabilities inherent to its public, open platforms. Threads fits into that future, as it is a social app built around private interaction.\n\nThreads is also somewhat interoperable within Facebook's ecosystem, in that it links communications sent within the app with Instagram. Notably, Threads doesn't yet build in end-to-end encryption, which is still only the default on Facebook-owned WhatsApp. But Facebook has said that encryption would become the default in messaging across the entire family of apps, including Instagram and Facebook, which indicates that it's likely to also eventually come to Threads.\n\nWant to read more stories like this one?
