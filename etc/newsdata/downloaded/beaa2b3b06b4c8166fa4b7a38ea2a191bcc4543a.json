Here's how the Massachusetts senator has been able to stand out.\n\nPolling shows one of the most decisive factors for Democratic primary voters is which candidate\u2019s the best equipped to defeat President Donald Trump in a general election\n\nThey understand that the country cannot afford four more years of Trump \u2014 that failure\u2019s not an option, although it\u2019s still a clear possibility.\n\nIt\u2019s now increasingly clear that Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is the Democratic candidate most likely to beat Trump in 2020.\n\nTo understand why, take a close look at what really happened in 2016.\n\nThe Trump victory didn\u2019t result mainly from a mass exodus of blue-collar Democratic voters to the Republican candidate.\n\nIt\u2019s true that 9.8% of voters changed their votes from 2012 to 2016. But only 3.6% of voters moved from President Barack Obama to Trump. More than half of these were offset by the 1.9% who switched from Mitch Romney to Hillary Clinton \u2014 leaving a net loss of only 1.7%.\n\nThe lion\u2019s share of vote-changers were the 4.3% of the voters who moved from Obama in 2012 to a third-party candidate or to not voting for any presidential candidate in 2016.\n\nOf course, much of the net loss of vote-changers was concentrated in critical electoral states like Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Ohio.\n\nThe loss of white working-class voters to Trump was definitely a component of Clinton\u2019s defeat. But a greater component was that so many former Obama voters elected not to vote at all or vote for a third-party candidate.\n\nHere's what makes her unique\n\nThere are five reasons why Warren is best equipped to deal with these challenges:\n\n\u25baPolls show Warren\u2019s message that the economic system is rigged against ordinary people \u2014 and her willingness to unapologetically call for fundamental structural changes in the rules of the economic game \u2014 are very attractive to white working-class vote-switchers in the upper Midwest who haven\u2019t had a raise that outstrips inflation in 30 years.\n\nThese voters don\u2019t want continuity or stability, they want change. That\u2019s why many switched their vote in 2016. They believed Clinton represented the economic status quo.\n\nElizabeth Warren's choice: 'Medicare for All' purity or a path to beating Trump?\n\nWarren\u2019s call to voters in the most recent debate couldn\u2019t be clearer: \u201cThe paths to America\u2019s middle class have gotten a lot smaller and a lot narrower. ... I know what\u2019s broken. I know how to fix it and I\u2019m going to lead the fight to get it done.\u201d\n\nWarren correctly understands that a populist economic message is necessary to move swing voters \u2014 not just the base.\n\nSen.

They were motivated mainly by their disgust for Trump\u2019s cultural agenda. That disgust isn\u2019t going away regardless of the Democratic candidate.\n\nMany pundits question whether voters in states like Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania will identify with a Harvard Law professor. They forget that Warren grew up in Oklahoma. The personal stories she tells are the stories of voters raised in places like small-town Iowa, not around Harvard Square. Warren connects with working people because she can talk firsthand about their personal experiences and her own. Her story \u2014 her University of Houston education and her grit and tenacity to succeed \u2014 inspires them.\n\n\u25baWarren not only inspires white working-class voters, she inspires people of all sorts, particularly young people.\n\nShe\u2019s the candidate best equipped to deal with the most critical factor that gave us Trump: low turnout. She\u2019ll inspire people to vote because they\u2019re inspired by people who stand tall for their beliefs and are willing to fight for them. Voters are inspired by her passion, her grasp of the problems they face, her ability to formulate clear, understandable solutions and her willingness to stand up for progressive values.\n\n\u25baIn 2020, being a woman is a political asset. It promises to be the year that women strike back.\n\nWomen are overwhelmingly disgusted by Trump. They\u2019re disgusted by his sexism, lack of empathy, macho blustering and crude disrespectful language. They\u2019re disgusted when they see children ripped from mothers\u2019 arms at the border. They\u2019re furious that he\u2019s placing anti-abortion justices on the Supreme Court.\n\nWomen are mobilized like never before in American politics. A woman heading the ticket gives American women one more reason to work their hearts out and turn out in record numbers next fall.\n\n\u25baWarren and her team have demonstrated that they know how to organize a winning campaign. Her campaign has crafted a strategy that has lifted her consistently in the polls.\n\nHer team knows how to execute. They refuse to leave any stone unturned, understanding that showing up is half of politics, and they know how to communicate respect for voters. The campaign\u2019s loaded with inspired, fired-up organizers and it\u2019s exciting and fun. Those are qualities of winning campaigns.\n\n\u25baFinally, voters don\u2019t commit to candidates just because they think they\u2019re smart or make good speeches. They certainly don\u2019t evaluate candidates simply by comparing lists of issue positions.\n\nVoters commit themselves to candidates the same way people fall in love: They commit to candidates who make them feel good about themselves. That happens when candidates have \u201ccharisma.\u201d\n\nWhat goes into charisma?\n\nExperience shows there are four elements that make a candidate charismatic: The candidate must be warm. She must be approachable and communicate empathy. Second, she must have presence, and be \u201cin the moment\u201d at all times \u2014 laser-focused on the people she's with.\n\nThe woman with a strategy: Elizabeth Warren knows what we're facing and she has plans, from Fox News to Facebook\n\nThird, she must exude true self-confidence \u2014 the kind that comes from overcoming ordinary self-doubts that pop up like devils in practically everyone.\n\nFinally, the candidate must be inspiring. That means making people feel they\u2019re part of something bigger than themselves, but also that they can each play a truly significant role in achieving that larger goal.\n\nWarren does all of these.\n\nFor all those reasons, Elizabeth Warren is our best choice to defeat Trump. She\u2019s the most likely Democratic candidate to be the next U.S. president.\n\nRobert Creamer, a partner at Democracy Partners, has been a political organizer and strategist for five decades and was consultant in the last three Democratic presidential campaigns.
