He went out to the grocery van to grab her some bread, and was surprised to be met by a fan who grabbed him for a selfie. It\u2019s barely been a year since the 24-year-old alt-pop kid first released music, but after a trio of sold-out debut shows at his home city\u2019s most legendary venue, King Tuts Wah Wah Hut, he\u2019s starting to get recognised in the streets now. \u201cCannae even get a loaf of bread anymore, man!\u201d he jokes, lounging about in the green room before his debut London show. He\u2019s just sold out that one too.\n\nTruth be told, Joesef doesn\u2019t seem to know what he\u2019s doing or how he wound up here, but naturally, he\u2019s very good at it anyway. The 24-year-old writes alternative pop tunes with soul, swagger and sensitivity, as if someone\u2019s mashed Amy Winehouse and Rex Orange County together in some miraculous music machine and raised whatever it created in Scottish suburbia. The whole hysteria feels slightly incongruous to his humble upbringings right now. \u201cI try to not take it in because I think I\u2019ll lose my mind,\u201d he grins. \u201cI\u2019m taking it as it comes. I got sacked from a bar back in March and I haven\u2019t been back to work yet. It\u2019s class \u2018cause I don\u2019t need to work there anymore. Everything\u2019s all a laugh, innit? Easy breezy.\u201d Easy breezy is, perhaps, the best way to describe the languorous and lovely nature of his debut EP, \u2018Play Me Something Nice\u2019. It\u2019s love and heartbreak spun into sonic honey.\n\n2016 was the year it all started to make sense to him. At the age of 20, he fell in love with someone so hard that he now has those two digits tattooed on his ribcage to remind him of those times. \u201cIt was a pure summer of love,\u201d he smiles, \u201cand it was my first boy as well.\u201d He compares that experience, after years of dating girls, to being hit by a train. For months, the pair kept their love secret, fearing the reactions of their families at first. But behind closed doors, something special was flourishing: \u201cIt was like a film. I got a pure beemer [Scottish slang for flustered and embarrassed] and could hear romantic background music playing when I saw him!\u201d\n\nWhen he came out as bisexual, it was hardly a big deal. But that initial hesitation, we say, might be a Scottish thing; I grew up 40 minutes from him and took my time telling my family I was queer too. \u201cIt goes without saying that, growing up in the east end of Glasgow being anything other than a big straight boy has negative connotations,\u201d Joesef says. \u201cBut it was never a massive thing for me, which I\u2019m really lucky about because it is for some people. I\u2019ve never really had any hassle about it.\u201d Times have started to change, I suggest. \u201cAye,\u201d he responds, pausing to let it sink in before revelling in that thought: \u201cFuckin\u2019 yass!\u201d\n\nThat two year relationship, as well as how it eventually came to an end, inspired the songs of Play Me Something Nice, six tracks of flourishing romance, fuck ups and bad decisions that feel good in the moment. That first queer courtship might\u2019ve given him a \u201cthe world\u2019s ending kinda buzz\u201d, but he has the rare ability to make even the most dismal of situations sound quite sweet. The grounded title track sees him battling with that awful feeling of wanting the company of someone you\u2019ve parted with. \u201cI know that it\u2019s over,\u201d he sings, before sidelining that fact for a romantic fate more satisfying: \u201cSo do you wanna come over \u2018cause I\u2019m cold and I\u2019m tired of lying to myself? I need you here with me.\u201d\n\nAlthough a career as a musician wasn\u2019t always in his sightlines as a kid, Joesef was surrounded by the influences that imbue much of his sound now from an early age. \u201cIt was always old music, even when I wis a baby. A pure foetus singin\u2019 Al Green!\u201d That was his mum\u2019s touch: she appreciated the masters of mid-20th century soul, but always made room for a little bit of 90s pop too; the Spice Girls were a really big thing in his house too. And that wasn't his only formative pop experience: \u201cJustice for Artpop!\u201d he grins, when I asked if, like most queer kids growing up in the 2010s, he had a soft spot for Lady Gaga. \u201cI pure liked [her] when she first came out but I kept it a secret, but as I got older, I realised she\u2019s an amazing musician. She does that jazz thing with Tony Bennett and he\u2019s ma guy! But aye, she\u2019s been away for a bit! Too busy winning Oscars.\u201d\n\nThat penchant for poppiness manifests in the EP through Joesef's knack for melody; you\u2019ll find yourself humming these songs days after you\u2019ve heard them. It\u2019s wild to think they\u2019re not the product of a dozens-strong writing room, but of a Glaswegian boy lying in his boxers, severely hungover and deep in his feelings, which is how most of them came to be. They\u2019re abrasively introspective at times; the kind of stories most keep secret. The EP\u2019s closer, Don\u2019t Give In, is deceptively sore. Lyrically, it tells a tale of Joesef, the boy he loves and another, waiting in the wings to steal his boy away from him. \u201cYou don't know how it hurts when you say you wish you met me first,\u201d he sings. \u201cSomehow that feels worse.\u201d Still, if you talk to him about this, he can shrug it off and make a joke about it; never blinded by his own talents. Humble. Northern.\n\nIt\u2019s this pluckiness and embrace of his strange circumstances that makes Joesef\u2019s ascent to fame even sweeter. His London show, at the cabaret-esque club Omeara, is peppered with record label executives; everyone\u2019s keen to snatch him up and shape him into the next big thing. But there\u2019s something incredibly grounded about him that suggests he won\u2019t be co-opted into some pretty major label package.\n\nAfter all, once you\u2019ve been through a heartbreak your world view changes, and you seem to know bullshit from what\u2019s good. Does Joesef know everything there is to know about love now? He exhales, exacerbated at the grandiosity of such a statement: \u201cI dunno man, it\u2019s unpredictable and extremely volatile!\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like a wee baby: you\u2019ve got to treat it good. If you treat it bad, something bad will happen to it!\n\n\u201cI guess I just feel things very intensely,\u201d he insists. \u201cI don\u2019t think I know anything about love, but who does?\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared on i-D UK.", "description": "Get to know the musician ahead of the release of his debut EP, 'Play Me Something Nice'.
