The Trump administration already has imposed some of the most stringent sanctions ever on Iran\u2019s oil industry, refused to extend oil waivers and threatened secondary sanctions on entities that fail to comply.\n\nIt has also already designated Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a foreign terrorist organization. The IRGC runs Tehran\u2019s ballistic-missile programs and its specialized Quds Force has arranged weapons deliveries and advised proregime militias in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere in the region.\n\nAs an added challenge, the Trump administration\u2019s foreign-policy team has narrowed with the departure of national security adviser John Bolton earlier this week. Mr. Bolton was the chief architect of the Iran strategy and the third national security adviser to leave the White House since 2017. The post of director of national intelligence is vacant, while a new secretary of defense started in July, filling a monthslong vacancy.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo, a fellow hawk, has been a steady and vocal advocate of the maximum pressure campaign since the U.S. withdrew from the nuclear deal with Iran and six world powers. He clashed often with Mr. Bolton and now stands to have more sway over foreign policy than at any time since moving from the Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nOn Saturday, Mr. Pompeo delivered the first U.S. response to the attacks on Saudi\u2019s oil output, blaming Iran and asserting there was no evidence the strikes came from Yemen, contrary to claims made by the Houthis there.\n\n\u201cWe call on all nations to publicly and unequivocally condemn Iran\u2019s attacks. The United States will work with our partners and allies to ensure that energy markets remain well supplied and Iran is held accountable for its aggression,\u201d the secretary said on Twitter.\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear what further measures could be introduced to increase economic pressure on Iran.\n\nThe administration may hope that its intelligence tying Tehran to the attacks may convince more European allies to come around to Mr. Trump\u2019s Iran strategy, despite longstanding opposition to his approach. However, on Saturday the response from other signatories to the Iran nuclear deal was slow, with only the U.K. condemning the attack.\n\nSaturday\u2019s attacks crippled Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil production, forcing output to fall to around half its regular 9.8 million barrels a day.\n\nMr. Pompeo had said earlier this week that Mr. Trump could potentially meet with his Iranian counterpart, Hassan Rouhani, when world leaders converge on New York later this month for the United Nations General Assembly. The prospects of such a meeting now appear unlikely.\n\nSimilarly, a French initiative to provide Iran economic relief from U.S. sanctions in return for its full compliance with a multinational nuclear accord seems as doomed as earlier European efforts to mediate a solution.\n\nMark Dubowitz, the chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington think tank, said this would be the worst time to give Iran sanctions relief as recommended by France, as it would be seen as giving in to blackmail.\n\n\u201cAs the Israelis have demonstrated, sometimes only a military response to aggression from the regime in Iran and its proxies creates meaningful deterrence,\u201d he said. \u201cWashington can\u2019t rely just on sanctions as its sole instrument of national power.\u201d\n\nThe French embassy in Washington didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMr. Trump has previously opted for dialogue over conflict. For instance, he shelved plans, supported by Mr. Bolton, for a retaliatory strike after Iran shot down a U.S. drone in June.\n\nProminent Republicans on Saturday were calling for a more aggressive response.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, took to Twitter on Saturday to call on the Trump administration to prepare to retaliate against Iran for the attack, calling it another example of how the country is wreaking havoc and not interested in peace.\n\n\u201cIt is now time for the U.S. to put on the table an attack on Iranian oil refineries if they continue their provocations or increase nuclear enrichment,\u201d Mr. Graham said in a tweet.\n\nThere was no immediate reaction from Sen. Bob Menendez (D., NJ.), the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nMr. Trump has said there are five potential candidates to replace Mr. Bolton, including the top U.S. envoy to Iran, Brian Hook, who has led the maximum pressure campaign for over a year. Mr. Hook didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cThe United States has limited options for non-escalatory intervention,\u201d said Kirsten Fontenrose, a former director for the Persian Gulf region in the Trump National Security Council.\n\n\u2014Ian Talley contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Jessica Donati at jessica.donati@wsj.com", "description": "The attacks on Saudi Arabia\u2019s energy-production system thrust President Trump into a fierce foreign-policy crosswind, at a time when his national security team is at its thinnest point in over a year.", "authors": ["Jessica Donati", "Jessica.Donati Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107248/social", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
