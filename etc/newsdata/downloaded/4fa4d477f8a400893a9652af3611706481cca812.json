Lowe, who's still recovering from his injuries, has had more than 20 surgeries since the crash.\n\nShepherd was found guilty Friday of three felony counts of reckless homicide. The jury also found her guilty of a felony count of criminal recklessness and a misdemeanor count of passing a school bus causing injury when the arm is extended. She faces up to 21-and-a-half years if given the maximum amount on each count.\n\nThe parents of Mason and Xzavier, Shane and Brittany Ingle, and Michael Stahl, Brittany's ex-husband and Alivia's dad, told reporters after the verdict that they were relieved, and have no sympathy for Shepherd, who they believe has shown no remorse for the crash.\n\n\"I don't think we'll ever feel closure,\" Brittany Ingle said. \"But this will go toward healing.\"\n\nOct. 30, 2018:Twin boys, sister killed by pickup truck at Indiana school bus stop\n\nShepherd and her attorneys quickly left the courtroom after the verdict was read early Friday evening and made no statement.\n\nEarlier Friday, Shepherd took the stand in Fulton Superior Court. Family members of Shepherd and the victims, had filled the Fulton County courthouse this week to hear testimony from witnesses and law enforcement.\n\nWhen asked by her attorney when it started to sink in that she\u2019d hit and killed three children after driving past a school bus, Shepherd described emotions ranging from disbelief to hysteria.\n\nBut at first it was confusion, according to her testimony. She remembered seeing blinking lights and something that appeared to be a large vehicle. But she didn't see a bus, Shepherd says, nor did she see the red sign telling her to stop.\n\nWhen she'd realized what she'd done, Shepherd says she was hysterical.\n\n\"The only way I can describe it is an out-of-body experience,\" Shepherd said, according to the account provided to IndyStar by the small number of reporters who were allowed into the packed courtroom, \"I was a mess.\"\n\nThe four children were crossing the highway to board their school bus about 7:15 a.m. when prosecutors say Shepherd blew by a stopped school bus. The road was dark but prosecutors said the bus lights and stop arm were clearly visible.\n\nWhether Shepherd was behind the wheel that morning was not being disputed, according to statements made from the defense and prosecution during the trial. Jurors instead decided whether Shepherd\u2019s actions were reckless or simply accidental.\n\n\"The thing that makes me sick here,\" Fulton County Prosecutor Michael Marrs said, \"is that this never should have happened.\"\n\nThe Crash\n\nShepherd was driving with three children in the back seat of her Toyota Tacoma before the crash happened, according to court documents. She had just dropped off her husband at work about 7:05 a.m. and was heading to her mother's home in the Rochester area to drop off her little brother when she rounded a bend on Ind. 25.\n\nShe'd taken that road many times before, her attorney Michael Tuszynski said, but rarely at that time of day.\n\nAs she was driving, the 24-year-old Shepherd saw something in the distance, but couldn't quite make it out, according to Tuszynski, who said that a freightliner was behind the bus, making it appear to Shepherd as one large vehicle.\n\n\"The circumstances of the bus, with the freightliner behind it, combined to create the profile of one vehicle, making it seem like it's a semi that's moving. And she's confused about what she sees.\"\n\nBut after the crash, the driver of another vehicle that was following Shepherd's Toyota through the bend on Ind. 25 said the school bus lights and stop arm were clearly visible even though the road was dark. This is according to testimony from Indiana State Police Detective Michelle Jumper during a probable cause hearing held hours after the crash.\n\nNY Limo crash:Faked brake work not to blame for New York limo wreck that killed 20, DA says\n\nThe witness said she and Shepherd were traveling at 45 mph, Jumper testified. The witness said she slowed when she saw the school bus and its blinking lights. Shepherd didn't.\n\n\"Suddenly she sees the children,\" Tuszynski said Friday. \"She brakes. But it was too late.\"\n\nShepherd's friend, Brittany Thompson, who spoke to Shepherd on the phone after the crash, testified that Shepherd said she'd seen the lights and was trying to negotiate how far to move over.\n\nThompson said Shepherd was distraught. \"I didn't know it was a bus,\" Shepherd reportedly said.\n\nThe victims' family told reporters Shepherd appeared cold during the trial, and seemed unconcerned with the deaths that resulted from her actions.\n\n\"When I was giving my testimony,\" Brittany Ingle said. \"I looked her straight in the eyes and she gave nothing. She had no remorse.\"\n\n'She totally stole their lives'\n\nTuszynski said there was no evidence of drugs or alcohol in Shepherd's system at the time of the crash. He placed blame on the location of the bus stop, which required the children to cross the highway to board the bus.\n\n\"The idea that it was okay to make those kids cross that busy road to get on a bus, rather than move the stop into the (trailer) park, is absurd,\" Tuszynski said.\n\nThe Tippecanoe Valley School Corporation announced shortly after the crash that it would relocate the bus stop into the trailer park where the students lived. Superintendent Blaine Conley testified Friday that the park had previously been considered for the location. But officials were worried that the school bus could potentially hit children in the area due to poor lighting.\n\nThe crash led to statewide changes, prompting the Legislature to increase penalties for drivers who illegally pass stopped school buses. Shane and Brittany Ingle spent several days at the Statehouse this past year lobbying for the changes.\n\nOct. 14:A girl was 'very scared' after a car crash. Two Utah firefighters saw her bottles of nail polish and had an idea\n\nThe victims' family told reporters that Friday's verdict was important for everybody, not just her children, because it reinforces the importance of driving safely near school buses.\n\nBut the family noted somberly that neither the verdict nor the sentence will bring their three children back.\n\n\"They didn't even get time to enjoy life,\" Brittany Ingle said. \"She totally stole their lives.\"\n\nContributing: Vic Ryckaert and Arika Herron.
