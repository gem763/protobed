The price has since eased to around $9,370 as of Monday morning, up about 1% on the day.\n\nThe virtual currency's jump came as China's leader sang the praises of blockchain, the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. According to state media, Xi said Friday that China has a strong foundation and should look to take a leading position in the sector.\n\nHe reportedly said China should \"seize the opportunity\" offered by blockchain, adding the technology could benefit a range of industries including finance, education and health care. A blockchain is a digital ledger that maintains a record of transactions or other data across a network of computers.\n\nBeijing has taken a tough stance on cryptocurrencies, banning a fundraising exercise known as an initial coin offering and forcing local trading platforms to shut down in 2017.", "description": "Bitcoin's price rose sharply over the weekend after Chinese President Xi Jinping gave a speech embracing blockchain technology.", "authors": ["Ryan Browne"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/102308293-459325038.jpg?v=1572254785", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
