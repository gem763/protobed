Time\n\nDestination Maternity filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Monday, as the apparel company hopes to avoid the growing graveyard of fashion retailers felled by expensive leases and digital competition.\n\nThe retailer operates stores under several brands, including Destination Maternity, Motherhood Maternity and A Pea in the Pod.\n\nThe company had 446 stores in the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico as of Aug. 3. It also operated 491 shops-within-a-shop at various department stores and baby specialty retailers.\n\nThe company plans to close 183 stores after already shuttering 27 recently, according to a court filing. Bankruptcy allows companies to escape unprofitable leases.\n\nFounded as a mail-order catalog business called Mothers Work in 1982, the company went public in 1992, acquired the Motherhood Maternity and A Pea in the Pod brands in 1995 and expanded rapidly in the years thereafter.\n\nBut the company, in a court document, blamed the retail industry's turmoil, declining birth rates, high rents and leadership turnover for faltering. The company has had five CEOs in the last five years.\n\nDestination Maternity declined further comment and declined to release a list of locations set to close.\n\nIn its bankruptcy petition, Destination Maternity listed $260.2 million in assets and $244 million in debts.\n\nDestination Maternity filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Oct. 21, 2019. (Photo: Courier-Post file photo)\n\nThe company's stock, traded on the Nasdaq, plunged 44% to 19 cents as of 2:10 p.m.\n\nOther fashion retailers that have filed for bankruptcy in 2019 include Forever 21, Charlotte Russe and Payless ShoeSource.\n\nMore store closings coming: An estimated 12,000 shops could close by the end of 2019\n\nIn its most recent fiscal quarter, which ended Aug. 3, Destination Maternity reported a year-over-year revenue decline of 11.9% and a net loss of $3.5 million.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/10/21/destination-maternity-chapter-11-bankruptcy/4055471002/", "description": "Destination Maternity filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Monday as the apparel company hopes to avoid the graveyard of fashion retailers.", "authors": ["Nathan Bomey", "Published P.M.
