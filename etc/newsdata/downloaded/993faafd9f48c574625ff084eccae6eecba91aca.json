She was trying to bring her garbage can up her driveway when she fell down and got hurt.\n\n\"Thankfully her trash guy was there and helped her back up and stayed with her until the ambulance arrived,\" Kingston told CBS News. \"Ever since then, he has brought her trash can to her house every week. They have produced a strong friendship since then.\"\n\nThe Waste Management worker, Billy Shelby, sees Zucca on a weekly basis, but a recent interaction between the two was caught on camera.\n\nIn January, my mom fell while trying to bring the trash can back up her driveway and got hurt. This gentleman from WasteManagement was there when it happened. Ever since, he has brought the can back up the driveway for mom. This was him today helping her; he demonstrates such care for her. It takes a village - such a small kind gesture but leaves a enormous relief for us. Thank you kind sir. Love, the Zucca family.
