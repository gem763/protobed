Thanks to a new generation of general managers, the trade deadline is now an integral part of the NFL season, one where things actually happen!\n\nDespite the NFL\u2019s reputation as a stodgy league that leans toward conservative business practices, in the past 10 days we\u2019ve seen one super-duper-star \u2014 Jalen Ramsey \u2014 get dealt for a package of draft picks, and three well-known players (Emmanuel Sanders, Mohamed Sanu and Michael Bennett) be moved as well.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAnd while there may not be another trade involving a player on Ramsey\u2019s level, here are seven players I\u2019m told \u2014 after asking around in recent days \u2014 are currently available before the Oct. 29 deadline, for the right price, of course.\n\nRobby Anderson is on a one-year deal with the Jets. (Getty Images)\n\nAnderson, 26, is set to be a free agent after this season, and the regime that currently runs the show in New York, led by general manager Joe Douglas and coach Adam Gase, did not draft him. That means there\u2019s little investment in the player, which means he\u2019ll likely be with a new team in 2020. If the Jets can get something more immediate for the 6-foot-3, 190-pound speedster, they\u2019ll strongly consider it.\n\nAnderson is on pace to have a modest season, projected to finish with 45 catches, 709 yards and three touchdowns. He is a deep-ball threat with a knack for making big downfield plays. He scored 13 total touchdowns in 2017 and 2018 in a putrid Jets offense, and as far as rentals go, a team that could use a downfield threat (cough, Eagles, cough) could do worse.\n\nStory continues\n\nExpectations were high for Thomas, 24, when the 49ers made him the third overall pick in 2017 after an outstanding college career at Stanford. But in the two-plus years since, Thomas has only six sacks.\n\nThomas, who is listed at 6-3 and 280 pounds, is viewed as a tweener \u2014 someone who is too big (and not fluid enough) to be a pure rush end \u2014 and not big enough to consistently hold up inside. The 49ers are rolling this season at 6-0 thanks to a nasty defense but Thomas has logged only 33.2 percent of the team\u2019s snaps, which ranks seventh among all their defensive linemen.\n\nWith Thomas\u2019 salary-cap number rising in 2020 \u2014 it will go up from $7.6 million to $8.9 million \u2014 it makes sense for the 49ers to seek a trade partner for Thomas, especially since they\u2019d clear zero cap space by releasing him. Yet, finding a team that would take on a fully guaranteed contract for a player without a defined role will be difficult.\n\nFalcons coach Dan Quinn spent the offseason prodding Beasley, 27, to maximize his ability and rediscover the pass-rush mojo the team saw when it drafted him with the eighth pick of the 2015 draft.\n\nUnfortunately for the 1-6 Falcons, it didn\u2019t work. Despite playing in 74.1 percent of the Falcons\u2019 snaps this year, Beasley\u2019s production has been modest at best, as he\u2019s recorded 14 tackles, five quarterback hurries and 1\u00bd sacks for the league\u2019s worst pass rush (five sacks all year). What\u2019s more, his run defense has historically left a little to be desired.\n\nBeasley\u2019s lack of production in a contract year is a concern for teams, as is the fact the current regime in Atlanta (Quinn and general manager Thomas Dimitroff) drafted him. If the price is right, there\u2019s a chance a team would make a low-risk bet on Beasley recapturing his All-Pro form of 2016, when he racked up 15\u00bd sacks.\n\nCampbell, 26, is in a bit of the same boat as Beasley, as teams will wonder why the same regime that drafted him is willing to move on.\n\nThe tape shows that Campbell, a four-year starter, has issues in pass coverage, and his run defense could definitely be more consistent.\n\nBut he\u2019s a really good athlete and he\u2019s also a steady tackler, as he leads the team with 63. Since he\u2019s on an expiring deal (like Beasley), a team needing a stack linebacker might be intrigued.\n\nHarris, 30, is still one of the game\u2019s best cornerbacks. He\u2019s a willing run defender (despite his size at 5-10 and 199 pounds) and a sticky cover man, both in the slot and out, with sharp eyes and ball skills. Those are valuable skills, and he\u2019s being wasted away on this 2-5 Broncos team.\n\nSince Harris will likely be elsewhere in 2020 \u2014 he re-upped for only a year this past offseason \u2014 it makes sense for Denver to get a draft pick for him in 2020 instead of waiting on a 2021 compensatory pick.\n\nGeneral manager John Elway recently said he hasn\u2019t received any interest lately, but given the pass-happy nature of today\u2019s game, some fringe contenders (cough, Eagles, cough) would be wise to keep checking in.\n\nThe 26-year-old Vaitai \u2014 otherwise known as \u201cBig V\u201d \u2014 has been a versatile contributor for the Eagles since he was taken in the fifth round of the 2016 draft, logging snaps at left tackle, left guard, right guard and right tackle. At 6-6 and 320 pounds, he moves fairly well for his size, and he even started at left tackle for the 2017 Super Bowl champions.\n\nVaitai\u2019s contract expires after this season, and with the Eagles\u2019 starting group currently set \u2014 and the team\u2019s selection of quick-footed left tackle Andre Dillard in this year\u2019s draft \u2014 Vaitai\u2019s days in Philly seem to be numbered, as he\u2019ll be able to command a starting job on the open market in March.\n\nThe Eagles, at 3-4, might opt to get something for him now, especially if a lineman-needy team \u2014 like Cleveland \u2014 comes calling.\n\nMany projected Williams, 25, to be a star when the Jets selected him with the sixth pick of the 2015 draft.\n\nIt has not happened. Williams has averaged about four sacks a year from 2015 to 2018, and this year he has recorded zero sacks and five quarterback hits for the 1-5 Jets, despite leading their defensive linemen in snap percentage with 75 percent.\n\nConsidering he\u2019s slated to be a free agent next spring, that\u2019s disappointing production for a contract season. And when you throw in the fact that again, there\u2019s a new regime in New York \u2014 one that did not draft him \u2014 it makes sense why the Jets would be looking to move on.\n\nAny team that trades for Williams would have to absorb the remainder of his $14.2 million cap number for 2019, which isn\u2019t great. But he is regarded as a solid run defender with the athleticism to be a good interior rush, and given his youth it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise to see someone bet on their ability to get the best out of a player who was once regarded as the best player in his draft class.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "This group includes the Jets' Robby Anderson, who offers downfield game-breaking ability for a contender.", "authors": ["Terez Paylor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/SUtwdIWau6tLQEwsJNjYIA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xbZChuaPeyIHPfCJ3T0gwQ--~B/aD0zOTIzO3c9NTg4NTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/2363dbb0-f6d3-11e9-bff7-7e001d6ccd98", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
