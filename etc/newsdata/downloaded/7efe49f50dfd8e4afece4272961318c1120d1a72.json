The abstract futuristic video then sees him somehow teleport to a strip club before battling a robot. Following the fight, Scott ends up where he started, underneath the clouds, but this time on top of a building.\n\nK Y B R O W S coming 4/29 @kyliecosmetics pic.twitter.com/GR2roBUDVG \u2014 Kylie Jenner (@KylieJenner) April 22, 2019\n\nWhile the song was presumably recorded months ago, the lyrics seem to point to strife in his relationship: \u201cI\u2019m doing a show, I\u2019ll be back soon/ That ain\u2019t what she wanna hear.\u201d\n\nIn February, TMZ reported that Scott had canceled his Buffalo, New York show after an argument with Jenner, 22, as she accused him of cheating.\n\nA rep for Scott strongly denied the claim that he was unfaithful and Jenner\u2019s rep had no comment.\n\n\u201cBuffalo I\u2019m so sorry I can\u2019t perform tonight. I\u2019m under the weather and it f\u2014ing sucks!\u201d tweeted Scott.\n\nRELATED: Kylie Jenner Speaks Out After Split from Travis Scott: \u2018Our Main Focus Right Now Is Stormi\u2019\n\nView photos Travis, Stormi and Kylie Jenner | Jon Kopaloff/FilmMagic More\n\nAlso on the track, Scott raps, \u201cWhen I\u2019m with you, I feel alive/You say you love me, don\u2019t you lie.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t cut my heart, don\u2019t wanna die/Keep the pistol on my side,\u201d he continues.\n\nOn Thursday, Jenner confirmed her split from Scott \u2014 and denied rekindling things with an old flame.\n\nHours after news broke on Tuesday that the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star and rapper were taking a break from their relationship, the Daily Mail, reported that Jenner reunited with ex-boyfriend Tyga at a recording studio inside the Sunset Marquis.\n\nJenner was photographed leaving Delilah in West Hollywood in the early hours of Wednesday morning with friends Anastasia \u201cStassie\u201d Karanikolaou and Kelsey Calemine, who were then seen at the studio.
