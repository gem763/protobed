Authorities said Sacoolas, questioned at the scene, said she would stay in the area. She instead left for the U.S. and claimed diplomatic immunity.\n\nNorthamptonshire Police Harry Dunn, 19, was killed when authorities said his motorcycle was struck by a car driving on the wrong side of the road.\n\nLast week Sacoolas released a statement through a legal representative that expressed sympathy to the Dunn family.\n\n\u201cAnne is devastated by this tragic accident. No loss compares to the death of a child and Anne extends her deepest sympathy to Harry Dunn\u2019s family,\u201d said her statement, obtained by ITV News.\n\nHarry Dunn\u2019s mother, Charlotte Charles, called Sacoolas\u2019 actions inexcusable.\n\n\u201cWhy\u2019s it taken so long? It\u2019s seven weeks tomorrow since we lost our boy. We feel that that statement should have come out from her right from the beginning instead of getting on a plane and running home,\u201d Charles told CBS News. \u201cShe needs to get back on the plane. She needs to go back to the U.K. It\u2019s to just do the right thing.\u201d\n\nTim Dunn added that his family doesn\u2019t necessarily want to see Sacoolas, a parent herself, face jail time.\n\n\u201cThe last thing you want is to take a mother away from her children, and we really mean that, but she can\u2019t just walk away,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cWe just want justice for our son.\u201d\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson last week reportedly asked President Donald Trump in a phone conversation to reconsider Sacoolas\u2019 diplomatic immunity from possible U.K. prosecution.\n\nTrump, speaking to reporters at the White House later, appeared to defend Sacoolas and said Americans driving on the wrong side of the road in the U.K. \u201chappens.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was an accident, it was a terrible accident,\u201d Trump said.", "description": "Harry Dunn described seeing his son for the last time following the crash with an American who later invoked diplomatic immunity and left the U.K.", "authors": ["Breaking News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9b49642100009004ab8efe.jpeg?cache=7l4w719rj7&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
