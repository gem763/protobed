Yemen\u2019s Iran-aligned Houthi group claimed responsibility for the attacks, which have cut Saudi oil output roughly in half.\n\nPompeo said Iran was behind nearly 100 attacks on Saudi Arabia while leaders in Tehran \u201cpretend to engage in diplomacy.\u201d\n\nSunni Saudi Arabia and Shi\u2019ite-led Iran back opposing factions across the Middle East, from Yemen and Syria to Lebanon and Iraq. Saudi Arabia is leading a military coalition to back Yemen\u2019s internationally recognised government against the Houthis.\n\nWashington, a staunch ally of Riyadh, has adopted a tough anti-Iran \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d policy to force Tehran to negotiate a broader deal that further curbs its nuclear programme, restricts Tehran\u2019s ballistic missile work and ends its support for regional proxy forces.\n\nConway said the U.S. Energy Department is prepared to tap into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve after the attacks on Saudi oil facilities if needed to stabilize the global energy supply.\n\n\u201cWe have energy under our feet and off our shores, and this president is leading the way to responsibly develop it so that when Iran attacks Saudi Arabia over 100 times, we are prepared to take action to protect our own interests,\u201d she said.", "description": "The White House on Sunday did not rule out a potential meeting between President Donald Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, even after Washington accused Iran of being behind drone attacks on Saudi oil facilities.", "authors": ["Doina Chiacu", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190915&t=2&i=1430128480&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8E0FY", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
