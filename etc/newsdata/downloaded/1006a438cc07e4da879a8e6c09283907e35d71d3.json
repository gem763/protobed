Ultimately, the NBA put its foot down and told China that Morey would not be punished. But it took a while.\n\nAnd it only came after much public pressure.\n\nPence, reacting to the matter, said this: \u201cIn siding with the Chinese Communist Party and silencing free speech, the NBA is acting like a wholly owned subsidiary of the authoritarian regime.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s just the truth.\n\nThe NBA could certainly have handled the situation in a way that didn\u2019t make it appear as if it were bending knee to Communist investors.\n\nNow here comes Barkley, tossing fuel on the fire \u2014 and in so doing, appearing himself to side with Communists over Americans.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, Vice President Pence needs to shut the hell up,\u201d Barkley said, as The Hill reported. \u201cAll American companies are doing business in China.\u201d\n\nWell, not all \u2014 but many.\n\nAnd even so: Not many are in the news right now for appearing to cave to China interests.\n\nBarkley does raise a good point, though. He asks, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why these holier-than-thou politicians \u2014 if they\u2019re so worried about China, then why don\u2019t they stop all transactions with China?\u201d\n\nMaybe more should.\n\nMaybe America ought to reconsider its market dealings with China \u2014 a country that curbs its own citizens\u2019 freedoms while imprisoning those who simply want to worship their god of choice. A country that chills with its ever-present surveillance systems.\n\nMaybe America ought to get back to the \u201cMade In America\u201d manufacturing game and stop worrying about cheap goods to buy from China.\n\nBut in the meantime, maybe it\u2019s Barkley who ought to stifle a bit. After all, if Barkley were a Chinese citizen, he wouldn\u2019t get away with telling his government leaders to \u201cshut the hell up.\u201d It\u2019s only his American freedom that gives him the ability to say that. And Barkley would do well to treat that privilege as the very precious gift it is.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
