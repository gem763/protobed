Days before its most recent earnings report in late July, Uber laid off roughly one-third of its global marketing staff, or roughly 400 people. At the time, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi positioned the restructuring as an effort to make operations more efficient. \"There's a general sense that while we've grown fast, we've slowed down,\" Khosrowshahi said in an email to staff at the time seen by CNN Business.\n\nThe new layoffs appear in line with that sentiment.
