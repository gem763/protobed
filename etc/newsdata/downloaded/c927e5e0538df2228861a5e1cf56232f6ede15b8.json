In fact, our modern military \u2014 both active duty and retired \u2014 reflects our modern American society with its reliance on prescription drugs as a critical component of health care.\n\nThat\u2019s why recent reports of contaminated Chinese-made generic drug ingredients are causing more than heartburn in Washington. The Trump administration correctly views it as a risk to our national security.\n\nMy decade plus of service as a member of Congress on the House Ways and Means Committee provided unique insights into our relationship with China. Since that panel has jurisdiction over international trade and health care, Chinese intentions were often the subject of vigorous debate \u2014 both publicly and privately.\n\nPro-China trade advocates maintain that the Communist nation is moving toward \u201cfree market\u201d policy; a more accurate assessment is that China employs a \u201cmartial market\u201d policy. In other words, the Chinese view trade through the prism of military and geopolitical advantage. That advantage can come either through technology transfers which can enhance Chinese war-fighting capabilities or through actions that can inflict harm on a potential enemy.\n\nThe vulnerability of Americans through tainted prescription drugs is obvious and troubling.\n\nFirsthand evidence of Chinese drug contamination includes an experienced and expert source. Dr. Larry M. Wortzel is an eight-term commissioner of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission \u2014 a man who spent 32 years in our military, retiring as an Army colonel in 1999. He told Bloomberg that four of his blood-pressure medications were recalled in three months. Dr. Wortzel was taking a version of valsartan, an anti-hypertensive generic drug manufactured in India, but with active ingredients from China.\n\n\u201cThey were contaminated with rocket fuel \u2026 I imagine active (military) people have the same problem,\u201d Dr. Wortzel said. \u201cThis affects the readiness of our troops.\u201d\n\nThe \u201crocket fuel\u201d referred to by Dr. Wortzel is the probable carcinogen NDMA. Its discovery in valsartan prompted the Food Drug Administration (FDA) to announce a recall in July 2018 specifically naming China\u2019s Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceutical Co. The FDA believes the company\u2019s manufacturing process created NDMA as a by-product that went undetected for four years. Other companies in other countries using similar manufacturing processes have had to start their own recalls.\n\nThose recalls have done more than create business for law firms; they have prompted our national security apparatus to conduct a thorough re-examination of Chinese active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) and drug manufacturing in China. The National Security Council is trying to determine the most at-risk medications and the Defense Health Agency (DHA), which manages prescription drugs and other facets of health care for the military, understands the magnitude of the threat.\n\n\u201cThe national security risks of increased Chinese dominance of the global API market cannot be overstated,\u201d said Christopher Priest, the acting deputy assistant director for health care operations at the DHA.\n\nSo why have the risks of that Chinese API dominance and manufacturing \u201ccarelessness\u201d been heretofore understated? Because American consumers and Washington policymakers have been enraptured with the notion that generic medications \u2014 no matter where they are made \u2014 bring down costs.\n\nBut recent events are prompting a reassessment within the body politic. Rosemary Gibson, the author of \u201cChina Rx,\u201d in testimony before the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, put it this way: \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have our aircraft carriers and nuclear submarines built in China, and for very important medications we should really look at what it takes to purchase based on value not just price. We want cheap, we can buy cheap. But what\u2019s missing from the whole equation is quality.\u201d\n\nMost assuredly, there are more variables to this equation \u2014 and other pieces of this geopolitical puzzle. As the U.S.-China trade dispute continues, there are fears that China could unilaterally cut off drug shipments to gain leverage in future negotiations.\n\nBut such an action by China would most likely trigger resentment and resolve on Main Street, Wall Street and Pennsylvania Avenue. Despite some predictions of panic, Americans would realize that unsafe Chinese medications not only threaten our military, but also our general population.\n\nThe Ancient Chinese military strategist and philosopher Sun Tzu famously observed that \u201cOpportunities multiply as they are seized.\u201d\n\nWhether on Capitol Hill, at the White House or in the Pentagon, our policy makers must seize the opportunity to ensure the safety of prescription medicines. Not only is it a matter of public health and personal security, but perhaps most importantly national security.\n\n\u2022 J.D.
