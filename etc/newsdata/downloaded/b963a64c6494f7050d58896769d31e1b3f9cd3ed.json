Your nation\u2019s fourth-largest city hosted a \u201cHowdy, Modi!\u201d rally with a crowd of 50,000 Indian-Americans welcoming Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The event venue was NRG stadium, home to the NFL Houston Texans team. There was a waiting list of 5,000 for tickets and attendees came from 48 states.\n\nPrime Minister Modi chose a visit to Houston as his first trip to America since his landslide re-election victory in May. Why Houston? Well, it\u2019s the energy capital of the world and this trip is a perfect opportunity for Modi to be welcomed to the city by business leaders, as happened when he arrived Saturday. A large delegation of business leaders was on hand. Modi tweeted his greetings as he arrived.\n\nHowdy Houston! It\u2019s a bright afternoon here in Houston. Looking forward to a wide range of programmes in this dynamic and energetic city today and tomorrow. pic.twitter.com/JxzWtuaK5x \u2014 Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) September 21, 2019\n\nBut the location of Modi\u2019s latest visit is revealing. A joint appearance by Modi and Trump in America\u2019s oil and gas capital reflects a desire by Washington and New Delhi to deepen their bilateral energy cooperation. Last year, Washington and Delhi signed a U.S.-India Strategic Energy Partnership to enhance collaboration in this arena. Both countries believe the full promise of energy trade remains unfulfilled and want to increase cooperation, particularly with respect to shale and liquefied natural (LNG) gas. India\u2019s massive energy demand coupled with its limited domestic supply makes it a huge potential market for American oil and gas exporters. Rising tensions elsewhere around the world have also created conditions favorable for greater U.S.-India energy trade. American sanctions against Iran have forced New Delhi to stop importing oil from Tehran, traditionally one of its biggest suppliers. China has ceased purchases of American oil in February as a result of an ongoing trade war between Washington and Beijing.\n\nThere are about 120,000 Indian-Americans in the Houston area. While a majority vote for Democrats, Trump did receive some support in 2016, the same that Romney did in 2012. About 75% voted for Hillary.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t organized as a political event, mind you. This was not a Trump rally. It was organized as a community event \u2013 the largest gathering of Indian-Americans in the United States. Modi invited Trump, though, and the president accepted the invitation. Instead of just making a guest appearance, as originally thought, he was put on the program to deliver a speech with about 30 minutes allotted to him. The majority of the audience was foreign-born.\n\nSome were not happy that the event took a turn into politics. This was organized as a cultural celebration and a unity summit.There were protesters. Sikhs For Justice protested, for example. It is notable that the Indian Muslims Association of Greater Houston chose to be a Welcome Partner for the community reception instead of protesting. There is tension between Muslims and Modi over his recent crackdown in Kasmir.\n\nHouston Police Department (HPD) tweeted that \u201crumors\u201d of restrictions to media access of protesters and attendees were wrong.\n\nSocial media reports circulating that HPD is impeding or restricting media access to demonstrators and attendees. Reports are false. A secured area for media is set up in close proximity to the assembly zones. Media interviews have been & are being conducted freely. #hounews \u2014 Houston Police (@houstonpolice) September 22, 2019\n\nModi introduced President Trump as \u201ca very special person\u201d. He said, \u201cHis name comes up in almost every conversation around the world on global policy.\u201d He ran through Trump\u2019s resume and said, \u201cHe\u2019s left a lasting effect everywhere.\u201d That must cause heartburn for Trump\u2019s critics. The summit was broadcast in India. Modi said, \u201cWe are witnessing history in the making.\u201d Trump received a standing ovation both at the beginning and at the end of his speech..\n\nTrump\u2019s speech was mostly standard campaign talking points, which is good since it was an opportunity for voter outreach. He would have been foolish to not take the time to run through his administration\u2019s economic successes. Trump touted the strong economy nationally and in Texas. He spoke about Indian-American owned businesses and investments in Texas. He went on to cover everything from the space program to immigration. He spoke truthfully that legal immigrants don\u2019t support open borders and illegal immigration. When he spoke of combatting radical Islamic terrorism, Trump received another standing ovation. He also mentioned that the U.S. and India are putting together two new defense deals. The Trump administration is working on expanding exports to India and that includes LNG, which is good news for Texas.\n\nI switched over to CNN during Trump\u2019s speech and the network wasn\u2019t carrying the speech live as FNC did. After Trump finished, Boris Sanchez, CNN White House Correspondent did a live shot from the stadium while Modi spoke. The subject CNN chose to talk about during that live shot was about the Ukraine corruption story, not the story of the two leaders of the world\u2019s largest democracies sharing a stage and a bromance. This is my shocked face.\n\nElected officials from Texas were in the front row. Senators Cornyn and Cruz as well as Texas State Representatives and Senators were present. Both Modi and Trump received a Texas-size welcome. From Houston, Trump travels to Wapakoneta, Ohio to meet Australia Prime Minister Scott Morrison for a tour of a new Australian-owned manufacturing facility.", "description": "Diaspora", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Modi.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
