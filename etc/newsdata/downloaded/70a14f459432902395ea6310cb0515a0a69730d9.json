But U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials are refuting their story, accusing the family of \u201cdeliberately\u201d attempting to enter the country illegally.\n\n\u201cWe will never forget, we will be traumatized for the rest of our lives by what the United States government has done to us,\u201d Eileen Connors, 24, wrote in an affidavit released by an immigration legal services center in Pennsylvania, where the family was most recently detained. Connors said she and her family were \u201ctreated like criminals\u201d in cold and unsanitary U.S. immigration facilities.\n\nAttorneys at Aldea-The People\u2019s Justice Center, a nonprofit that provides legal representation to immigrants, were representing the Connors family and said they learned Wednesday morning that the family had been deported back to the United Kingdom, but had no further information.\n\nIn her affidavit, Connors said she, her husband and their infant had been visiting Vancouver with extended family members and had not intended to visit the United States that evening. But while driving near the border, she says the family swerved to avoid an animal and drove onto an unmarked road without realizing they were crossing into the U.S.\n\nHowever, CBP said in a statement that video surveillance captured a vehicle \u201cslowly and deliberately driving through a ditch\u201d and entering the United States illegally in Blaine, Wash., on Oct. 2 around 9 p.m. A Border Patrol agent pulled the vehicle over shortly thereafter and arrested the seven occupants\u2014four adults, the baby and 2-year-old twins, all United Kingdom citizens.\n\n\u201cDuring processing, record checks revealed two of the adults were previously denied travel authorization to come to the United States,\u201d the CBP statement said. \u201cAttempts were made to return the individuals to Canada, however, Canada refused to allow their return and two attempts to contact the United Kingdom consulate were unsuccessful.\u201d\n\nBut the family\u2019s attorneys pushed back on the CBP statement.\n\n\u201cWe are not surprised that the agency would put the character of non-citizen victims of their misconduct and neglect into question to justify their actions,\u201d a spokesperson for Aldea -The People\u2019s Justice Center said in a statement Wednesday afternoon. \u201cHowever, their communication in no way contradicts the family\u2019s account that for a brief moment they turned into an unmarked road on United States soil.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe find no other part of [CBP\u2019s] statement to be relevant,\u201d the Aldea statement said. \u201cThere is nothing that justifies the imprisonment of babies and toddlers, for any period of time.\u201d\n\nBridget Cambria, an attorney at Aldea, filed a formal complaint on behalf of the family with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\u2019s inspector general and civil rights office.\n\n\u201cEmotionally and psychologically, they\u2019re destroyed,\u201d Cambria told the Washington Post. \u201cThey\u2019re very upset about what\u2019s happened to them because it doesn\u2019t make sense. Anyone that reads their statement or hears their story will not understand how this could\u2019ve possibly happened.\u201d\n\nIn her statement, Connors described the ordeal as \u201cthe scariest experience of our entire lives.\u201d She said she had to sleep with her infant on the \u201cdisgusting floor\u201d of a cold cell the first night of her detention. They were later taken to a Red Roof Inn in Seattle, and were eventually flown to a detention center in Pennsylvania.\n\nA CBP spokesperson directed further questions about the family\u2019s detention to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\nICE officials confirmed that Eileen and David Connors had been transferred to the Berks Family Residential Center in Leesport, Pa., describing the facility as \u201ca safe and humane environment\u201d with an \u201coutstanding track record.\u201d\n\n\u201cICE has ensured the Connors have had access to United Kingdom (U.K.) consular officials while in ICE custody,\u201d the agency said in a statement. \u201cFor operational security, ICE does not discuss specific removal arrangements prior to an individual\u2019s successful repatriation.\u201d\n\nBut the facility has faced allegations of health and human rights abuses in the past. In 2016, more than 20 mothers detained at the center went on a two-week hunger strike because of the way their children had been affected by more than a year in detention, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported. Protesters have since called for the center to be shut down.", "description": "Border officials have accused them of \"deliberately\" trying to enter illegally", "authors": ["Katie Reilly"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Y.38DDOIsKslJ6f_4darWg--~B/aD0zNzY1O3c9NTY0NztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/f2865ca74649e656b4b33a1573007205", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
