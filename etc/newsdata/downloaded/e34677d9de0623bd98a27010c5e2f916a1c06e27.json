The men's convictions were vacated in 2002.\n\nThe lawsuit takes issue with one particular line of dialogue in the series, in which a city official disparages a detective who interviewed the teenagers.\n\nRead more: Fans of Netflix's new drama 'When They See Us' are calling for a boycott of the Central Park 5 prosecutor's books\n\n\"You squeezed statements out of them after 42 hours of questioning and coercing, without food, bathroom breaks, withholding parental supervision. The Reid Technique has been universally rejected. That's truth to you,\" the official says in the episode, according to the complaint.\n\nThe Reid Technique refers to a three-step interrogation process created by the firm John E. Reid and Associates, which includes fact analysis, investigative non-confrontational interview, and interrogation.\n\nThe Reid Technique outlines a step-by-step guideline to interrogate criminal suspects\n\nCaleel Harris in \"When They See Us.\" Atsushi Nishijima/Netflix\n\nAccording to the guidelines, when an investigator reaches the interrogation stage of the Reid Technique, they should step out of the room briefly and return with a folder, and state that they have evidence the suspect committed the crime.\n\nThe guidelines say \"this type of accusation is made only where the suspect's guilt seems very clear.\"\n\nBut the firm says in their suit that DuVernay's film grossly mischaracterized the technique, using scenes where police officers struck, abused, and isolated the teenage suspects, depriving them of food, bathroom breaks, and access to their parents.\n\n\"Vitally important to the instant case is that the Reid Technique does not involve and prohibits: striking or assaulting a subject, making any promises of leniency, denying a subject any rights, conducting excessively long interrogations, and denying a subject any physical needs,\" the lawsuit said.\n\nThe lawsuit says DuVernay's series blames the Reid Technique for advocating 'coercive tactics'\n\nComposer Kris Bowers, actors Marsha Stephanie Blake, Asante Blackk, Jharell Jerome, Niecy Nash, Aunjanue Ellis, filmmaker Ava DuVernay and J.J.
