The first looks at the 2016 election and sees Democrats losing persuadable working-class white votes \u2014 and therefore the key Rust Belt states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. The second looks at the same election and identifies a decline in turnout from Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 election in those states as the reason for Trump\u2019s victory.\n\nThere\u2019s validity to both ways of looking at what happened. Analysis completed by a team of researchers last year found that about 7 percent of 2012 Obama voters didn\u2019t vote in 2016 and 9 percent voted for Trump. Nearly all those who went from Obama to Trump were white; the research suggests that 12 percent of white Obama 2012 voters voted for the Republican four years later.\n\nAddressing the first problem means trying to win votes back. Addressing the second problem means trying to reinvigorate voters who skipped the election three years ago.\n\nThere\u2019s necessarily overlap here with the aforementioned policy disputes. After all, one might reasonably assume that voters wooed by Trump are less likely to embrace more progressive policy proposals. (Candidates like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) reject this assumption, for what it\u2019s worth.) Advocates for focusing on boosting turnout, meanwhile, suggest that innovation and clarity of ideology is the sort of thing that inspires people to actually make time to vote.\n\nThis debate gets simplified into another, related question: To what extent do Democrats need to worry about winning over white working-class voters at all?\n\nBloomberg\u2019s Sahil Kapur put it this way in a tweet Sunday. (Lack of college degree is a common way of identifying working-class voters in polling.)\n\nWhite voters without a college degree\n\n\n\n...voted Romney 61-36% in \u201812.\n\n\n\n...voted Trump 66-29% in \u201816.\n\n\n\n...voted Republican 61-37% in \u201818.\n\n\n\nThat any Democrat could make meaningful gains with this group in 2020 is an arbitrary assumption that requires serious evaluation. \u2014 Sahil Kapur (@sahilkapur) September 15, 2019\n\nThe first three numbers are correct, taken from exit polling conducted by Edison Media Research. The conclusion \u2014 about the inability to make \u201cmeaningful gains\u201d \u2014 is disputed. Cook Political Report\u2019s Dave Wasserman, for example, replied succinctly.\n\nIt\u2019s this shift from a 25% to 37% R margin between 2012 and 2016 that won Trump the presidency. https://t.co/YLLth0RV5H \u2014 Dave Wasserman (@Redistrict) September 16, 2019\n\nKapur\u2019s data can be read to suggest both that Democrats aren\u2019t going to win working-class whites and, further, that it doesn\u2019t matter. Democrats have lost the group by wide margins in elections they both won (2012 and the 2018 House races) and lost.\n\nHis assessment overlaps with analysis produced by Gallup this year. The venerable polling firm determined that since about 2006, partisan views of whites with or without college degrees have splintered. Whites without degrees have gotten consistently more Republican while those with degrees, after tracking more to the right for a while, started trending increasingly Democratic from about 2010 on.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, why bother trying to win those working-class voters over?\n\nWasserman\u2019s point is that degree matters. In a series of subsequent tweets, he notes that there\u2019s a link between the states that Trump flipped in 2016 and the density of their working-class white populations.\n\nWe can visualize that pretty clearly. As the density of working-class whites among the over-18 population in a state increases, so did the margin by which it preferred Trump in 2016. It\u2019s not a perfect correlation, but it\u2019s a robust one.\n\nOn that graph we\u2019ve highlighted six states. Three are those that flipped to Trump three years ago, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The other three are Arizona, Georgia and Texas, states that have consistently voted Republican \u2014 but which are also consistently mentioned as ones that might soon turn blue. As it turns out, those six states give us interesting insight into that fundamental Democratic debate.\n\nLet\u2019s start by looking at Kapur\u2019s initial data. Here, we\u2019ve plotted three elections: 2008 (which the Democrats won), 2016 (which they won in terms of actual votes though not electoral votes) and the 2018 midterms. You can see the bulge Wasserman points to: in 2016, the gap between those top and bottom lines is much wider than the gaps in 2008 or 2018.\n\nNotice something else, though: the density of the white working-class vote in 2018 (the gray line) was higher than in 2016. This is a function of the 2016 electorate being larger and more diverse, as presidential years generally are. Notice, too, that the density of the white working-class vote was also larger in 2008 \u2014 a function of our elections getting more diverse over time. The 2008 election that brought Obama to the White House had a then-historically low density of white voters \u2014 but the 2014 election in which Republicans did well was just as diverse.\n\nThat diversification is one reason that some argue against the need for Democrats to appeal to white working-class voters. It is a group that has diminished as a percentage of the electorate even as nonwhite voters \u2014 who generally vote much more heavily Democratic \u2014 increase. But while that shift is real, it\u2019s not as dramatic as it may at times seem. Whites without a college degree were still 40 percent of voters last year and still make up just under 45 percent of the over-18 population in the country.\n\nAnyway. Back to Wasserman\u2019s point.\n\nBoth Pennsylvania and Wisconsin saw shifts from 2016 to 2018 that looked like the national shift, according to exit polls; the gap between support for Democrats and Republicans among working-class whites narrowed even as they made up more of the electorate. In Michigan, the gap with those voters actually widened. But in all three states, Democrats did much better in aggregated House voting than in the 2016 contest.\n\nIt\u2019s really important to note that these are imperfect measures. Exit polling is useful as a guidepost but isn\u2019t exactly gospel, particularly when looking at demographic subsets of an election. It\u2019s also important to note that we are comparing presidential preferences in 2016 with gubernatorial preferences in 2018.\n\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s compare the states above \u2014 the ones that flipped from blue to red in 2016 \u2014 to Arizona, Georgia and Texas.\n\nYou\u2019ll notice first that the gaps in support among white working-class voter between the parties are much wider than among the first three states we looked at.\n\nWhat really stands out here is Arizona: Democrats won more votes in House races, even though white working-class voters shifted more heavily to the Republican than in 2016 and made up more of the electorate?\n\nWell, here we see the effects of the actual races. In Senate exit polling, white working-class voters cast their ballots about as they had in 2016. Incumbent Gov. Doug Ducey romped over his Democratic challenger, while Kyrsten Sinema (D) edged out Republican Martha McSally in the Senate contest.\n\nThis state in particular seems to bolster Wasserman\u2019s point: With a narrower gap among white working-class voters, Sinema actually won.\n\nThere\u2019s another point not reflected in the graphs above that\u2019s also worth noting. In each of the six states except Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, the density of the nonwhite vote in 2018 was the same as in 2016. In those two states, nonwhite vote density was higher in 2018. The Democrats gained about the same margin in House races in those states as they did in Michigan, where nonwhite vote density was flat.\n\nBut it brings us back to the idea that turnout might also play a role.\n\nThe 2018 midterm election saw lower turnout than the 2016 presidential contest, as always happens in the modern era. But compared to 2016, the number of votes cast for Republicans sank more than the number of votes cast for Democrats.\n\nThis could be a function of either Republicans turning out less heavily or of votes flipping from Republicans to Democrats.\n\nWhat\u2019s really interesting is to look at how actual vote totals compared in the six states we isolated.\n\nIn the three states that went from blue to red in 2016, vote totals for both parties was down in 2018, but Republican totals were down more. In Michigan and Pennsylvania, 2016 votes for the Republican (that is, Trump) looks like a blip. In Wisconsin, the increase was in line with 2012 \u2014 but in 2012, a Wisconsinite was on the Republican ticket.\n\nIt looks like a surge in Republican votes coupled with a decline in Democratic ballots. Or, looking at the data another way, 2008 and 2012 look like a Democratic bubble. The 2004 results in each state were much closer to the 2016 results, particularly in Wisconsin, which Democrat John Kerry only barely won.\n\nIn each state, as Democratic vote totals dropped in 2012, Republican vote totals increased. 2016 looks like a surge in Republican votes, but clearly some of those votes were ones that four years earlier had voted Democratic. Boosting Democratic turnout in the states would have made a difference, but it seems likely given the narrow margins that stanching blue-to-red flips would as well.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, the trend in the vote margin in all three states was broadly in line with the change from 2008 to 2012.\n\nNow look at the other three states.\n\nThere, Republican vote totals have largely held steady, while Democratic totals have surged. In Arizona\u2019s House races, the steady uptick in Democratic votes passed the Republican total \u2014 again, was with nearly half of the votes in the state being cast by working-class whites who overwhelmingly backed the Republican governor. More people statewide voted for Democrats in the 2018 House races than voted for Hillary Clinton.\n\nThese six states are seeing diverging population trends. The ones that people think may soon turn blue are growing quickly \u2014 which is one reason that people think they may turn blue.\n\nThose new residents are often moving to cities, helping shift the states\u2019 politics. As we noted last month, there were 15 states in 2016 where at least 80 percent of the vote came from urban counties. Hillary Clinton won 11 of them. The four that she lost were Pennsylvania and Florida (which she lost by about 1 percentage point each) \u2014 and Arizona and Texas.\n\nWe can take from Arizona\u2019s 2018 election that there is certainly a need for Democrats to ensure that their deficits with white working-class voters don\u2019t get too wide. From the Rust Belt, a warning about how the aberration may have been 2008 and 2012, not 2016, in those heavily white-working-class states.\n\nThere\u2019s an overarching issue that\u2019s worth pointing out, a third layer to the discussion: Will resolving this issue matter in 2020?\n\n2016 was historically close. Exceptionally close. We spend an enormous amount of time reconsidering it simply because it\u2019s the most recent election and the one that brought the likely Republican nominee in 2020 to power. But it\u2019s very possible that these analyses of the thinly sliced margins in 2020 simply won\u2019t matter much. That the contest will be a lot more like a Doug-Ducey-style romp than a Kyrsten-Sinema-type nailbiter.\n\nThis debate, in other words, is largely about a contest that is in the past and which may not be repeated in 2020. The white working-class vote may not matter simply because the election ends up looking a lot more like 2008 than 2020.\n\nIn which case it\u2019s 2016 that\u2019s the outlier, not necessarily something to be studied to learn new details about where the country is headed.", "description": "It's a complicated question \u2014\u00a0that may end up being largely academic.", "authors": ["Philip Bump", "National Correspondent Focused Largely On The Numbers Behind Politics"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HS5MPXDTBQI6RPNBDDSTUREKCQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
