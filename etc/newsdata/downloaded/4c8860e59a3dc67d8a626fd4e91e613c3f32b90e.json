Out of possession they were organised, compact and forced errors from Manchester City. With Lia W\u00e4lti pulling the strings in her holding role, Jordan Nobbs and Kim Little were able to add the creative touches up ahead of her and it was a crisp pass slipped through to Vivianne Miedema from Little that provided the chance for the match-winning goal. It was Miedema\u2019s first in four games against City, who badly missed their midfield controller Keira Walsh. Walsh was serving the first game of a three-match suspension and without her they were devoid of ideas. It was City\u2019s first defeat of the season, having won their first four games before it. Nick Cushing will have to find a way to replace Walsh\u2019s ingenuity in midfield if they hope to bounce back strongly. The only real positive was the Ballon d\u2019Or nominee Ellen White making her City debut after returning from injury.\n\n\u2022 Match report: Arsenal 1-0 Manchester City\n\nBarclays FA Women's Super League (@BarclaysFAWSL) Just @VivianneMiedema doing @VivianneMiedema things \ud83c\udf1f\n\n\n\nHow important could this goal be in the title race? pic.twitter.com/ukgOD2nPH9\n\n2) Cosmopolitan Hammers can take heart from Chelsea defeat\n\nConsidering West Ham only joined the WSL at the beginning of last season, the work manager Matt Beard has done in a short space of time is incredible. Their squad has 16 different nationalities and it is possible to hear eight languages being spoken by them on a matchday. But Beard has found a way to gel the cosmopolitan group together and foster a strong team spirit. This was in evidence in the first 60 minutes against Chelsea, when the Hammers went toe-to-toe with Emma Hayes\u2019s supremely talented side before eventually taking the lead. The Canadian substitute, Adriana Leon, scored with her first touch after being summoned from the bench by Beard.\n\nBarclays FA Women's Super League (@BarclaysFAWSL) \ud83d\ude2e That's what you call impact!@WestHamWomen's @LeonAdriana9 scored with her first touch \ud83d\udc4f pic.twitter.com/5RUZn3jvm9\n\nThis woke Chelsea up and Hayes must be grateful that Wales international Sophie Ingle appears to be peaking early in the season. Having just been selected by Team GB she is high on confidence, and this showed as she scored her second goal of the campaign to bring Chelsea level having not found the net for the club before this season. Having been provider for the first, Ji So-yun fired home a goal of the season contender for Chelsea\u2019s second. Drew Spence got their third in injury time to confirm a win that takes Chelsea top. A fearless West Ham side can take heart from a valiant performance that would have been too much for lesser sides, though.\n\n\u2022 West Ham 1-3 Chelsea\n\n3) Kelly\u2019s class too much for Brighton\n\nChloe Kelly showed why she recently earned an England call-up as well as being voted WSL Player of the Month for September with another superbly taken goal to lift her clear at the top of the league\u2019s goalscoring charts. For all that Brighton have struggled this season, they were well-organised and offered resistance up until the 57th minute, when Kelly\u2019s lightning quick stepover and finish gave the Toffees\u2019 the platform to go on and win comfortably. Having lost their previous two games, Everton are back in form and a first senior goal for Esme Morgan, the young defender on loan from Manchester City, capped off a good day at the office for Willie Kirk\u2019s side.\n\n\u2022 Everton 2-0 Brighton\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Chloe Kelly, right, scored her fourth goal in five league games as Everton beat Brighton on Sunday.

Blues manager Marta Tejedor had big shoes to fill when she came in nearly a year ago to replace Marc Skinner, who was snapped up by Orlando Pride. She has implemented her style with limited success until now but the Blues were on top throughout this game, controlling possession and peppering Liverpool\u2019s goal with 16 shots. There was a lovely moment for Kerys Harrop, who scored with a towering header from 15 yards out, to set her side on their way to victory on her 130th WSL appearance (a club record). Lucy Staniforth tapped in late on to secure Birmingham\u2019s first points of the season. The only positives for Liverpool were the brave defensive display of Sophie Bradley-Auckland and bright spark Rinsola Babajide in attack. Avoiding relegation would be a success for either team. Maybe the tide is finally turning for Birmingham.\n\n\u2022 Birmingham 2-0 Liverpool\n\nBarclays FA Women's Super League (@BarclaysFAWSL) 3\ufe0f\u20e3 points for @BCFC_women...\n\n\n\n\ud83e\udd29 ...delivered by @lucystan37's fine effort! pic.twitter.com/5lhectZ1gc\n\n5) Graham shines for Tottenham\u2019s entertainers\n\nI tipped newly-promoted Spurs to struggle this season but they\u2019ve been great to watch and I\u2019m happy to admit that it looks like I was wrong. They\u2019re so strong in attack and it\u2019s hard to fathom why Kit Graham had not scored in the league until Sunday\u2019s game against Bristol City. She was lethal at the Stoke Gifford Stadium. Two sublime long-range strikes in two second-half minutes turned the game on its head and lifted Spurs up into sixth. If Graham can stay in top form, Tottenham should be able to enjoy a respectable debut season in the top flight.\n\n\u2022 Bristol City 1-2 Tottenham\n\n6) Galton\u2019s left-field runs have United on a roll\n\nHaving lost their opening two games, newly-promoted Manchester United have bounced back with three wins on the spin. Casey Stoney has obviously gone to work on the training ground since the early-season defeats and drilled the midfield and defence to make her side one of the division\u2019s toughest to break down. They also have well-rehearsed patterns of play on the left, where Leah Galton often finds space with clever diagonal runs. She was instrumental in United\u2019s success against a seasoned Reading side on Sunday, with a break down the left and a dangerous delivery towards the back post finding Kirsty Hanson, who finished smartly after a late surge into the box. Dutch World Cup finalist Jackie Grownen provided the second, springing a sharp counter-attack with a defence-splitting pass to free Jess Sigsworth, in a central role, whose smart finish sealed three points that lifted United up into fourth.\n\n\u2022 Manchester United 2-0 Reading", "description": "City looked out of ideas without Walsh, Kit Graham was lethal for Spurs and has the tide turned for struggling Birmingham?", "authors": ["Rachel Brown-Finnis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85019e47e1d58039bf287599d736c741d20f9be8/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=00972b65868105b2580af8dd4598c236", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
