In late August, intelligence officials referred the matter to the Justice Department as a possible crime, but prosecutors concluded last week that the conduct was not criminal, according to senior Justice Department officials.\n\n[Official readout: President Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelensky]\n\nThe document released Wednesday, in keeping with White House practice, is a memorandum of a telephone conversation and is not a verbatim account. A cautionary note on the memo of the call warns that the text reflects the notes and memories of officials in the Situation Room and that a number of factors \u201ccan affect the accuracy of the record.\u201d\n\nIn releasing the memo, the administration also revealed how senior government officials have wrestled for two months over what to do about the matter .\n\nThe controversy erupted into public view after The Washington Post reported last week that an internal whistleblower complaint had been filed about the phone call. As more details emerged, and Democratic demands for impeachment proceedings intensified , the White House scrambled to declassify and release a five-page account of the conversation.\n\nWhile the Justice Department has concluded the call did not violate campaign finance law, Democrats say the president\u2019s conduct \u2014 seeking a foreign country\u2019s aid in discrediting a political rival \u2014 betrayed his oath of office and endangered national security. Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, said the call \u201creads like a classic mob shakedown.\u201d\n\n[Pelosi announces impeachment inquiry, says Trump\u2019s courting of foreign political help is a \u2018betrayal of national security\u2019]\n\nWhite House officials said the call memo does not show the president seeking an investigation of Biden\u2019s son in exchange for providing aid to Ukraine and that accusations the president offered a quid pro quo to kneecap a political rival are unfounded.\n\nThe memo shows that the morning phone call began with Trump congratulating Zelensky on his election victory, and Zelensky effusively praised Trump in return.\n\nTrump said the United States \u201chas been very very good to Ukraine,\u201d and Zelensky replied by agreeing \u201c1,000 percent.\u201d The Ukrainian president went on to suggest his country may soon buy more anti-tank missiles from the United States. \u201cWe are almost ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes,\u201d Zelensky said.\n\nTrump replied: \u201cI would like you to do us a favor because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it.\u201d He then asked for help in finding the Democratic National Committee computer server that U.S. officials say was hacked by Russian intelligence in the run-up to the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cThe server, they say Ukraine has it,\u201d Trump says according to the memo. \u201cI would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it.\u201d\n\n[Giuliani pursued shadow Ukraine agenda as key foreign policy officials were sidelined]\n\nTrump repeatedly said Zelensky should work with Attorney General William P. Barr or Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani. Giuliani had separately pressed Ukrainian officials for a Biden inquiry.\n\n\u201cI would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it,\u201d Trump said, according to the White House memo which was declassified Tuesday.\n\nAs the half-hour conversation went on, Trump\u2019s requests of Zelensky shifted to a different topic: investigating the Bidens.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,\u201d Trump said, according to the memo. \u201cBiden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it. \u2026 It sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nZelensky replied that \u201cmy candidate\u201d for the prosecutor job \u201cwill look into the situation.\u201d He also noted he stayed at Trump Tower on his last visit to New York City, Trump invites him for a White House meeting \u2014 something the Ukrainian leader had wanted.\n\n\u201cWhenever you would like to come to the White House, feel free to call,\u201d Trump says, according to the White House\u2019s rough transcript.\n\n[Shane Harris on Post Reports: Trump \u201cdoes not specifically say to Zelensky in this call, \u2018Unless you investigate these people, I won\u2019t give you the aid,\u2019 but the context of that is all over this call.\u201d]\n\nSince Zelensky\u2019s election in April, Ukraine had urgently sought a meeting for the new president at the White House, a sit-down to demonstrate Washington\u2019s backing as it fights a long-simmering war with Russian-backed proxies. U.S. officials and members of the Trump administration wanted the meeting to go ahead, but Trump had personally rejected efforts to set it up, The Post reported last week.\n\nZelensky and Trump met Wednesday on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, but the White House still hasn\u2019t set a date for an Oval Office meeting.\n\nWhile political fights surrounding the phone call have raged for the last 10 days, government officials at a host of agencies have been privately dealing with the matter for more than a month.\n\nSenior Justice Department officials said the director of national intelligence referred concerns about the call to the Justice Department in late August, after the intelligence community inspector general found that it was a possible violation of campaign finance laws that ban people from soliciting contributions from foreign sources. Days later, the inspector general referred the matter to the FBI.\n\nCareer prosecutors and officials in the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division reviewed the rough transcript, which they obtained voluntarily from the White House, and determined the facts \u201ccould not make out and cannot make out\u201d the appropriate basis for an investigation, a senior Justice Department official said Wednesday. The final decision was made by Brian Benczkowski, who leads the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division. As part of their reasoning, Justice Department lawyers determined that help with a government investigation could not be considered \u201ca thing of value\u201d under the law, officials said.\n\nTheir primary source for reaching that conclusion was the memo, according to the officials. While prosecutors did gather information about how the White House memorializes presidential calls with foreign heads of state, they did not interview other White House officials who participated in the call. Justice Department officials still do not know who the whistleblower is, officials said Wednesday.\n\nIn a statement, Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division \u201creviewed the official record of the call and determined, based on the facts and applicable law, that there was no campaign finance violation and that no further action was warranted.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll relevant components of the Department agreed with this legal conclusion, and the Department has concluded the matter,\u201d Kupec said.\n\nKupec also said Trump had never spoken with Barr \u201cabout having Ukraine investigate anything related to former Vice President Biden or his son,\u201d nor had Barr talked about \u201canything related to Ukraine\u201d with Giuliani. She noted, though, that U.S. Attorney John Durham, who is exploring the origins of the FBI\u2019s probe into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia, was \u201cexploring the extent to which a number of countries, including Ukraine, played a role in the counterintelligence investigation directed at the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.\u201d\n\nTrump ordered the memo released following days of mounting pressure from Congress, and a new surge of Democrats who favor impeachment. The president\u2019s decision followed reports that he pressed Zelensky to investigate Biden, considered a leading candidate for the Democratic nomination to challenge Trump in 2020, and his son, Hunter Biden. White House officials said there were discussions for several days about releasing details of the call, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo expressing concerns and lawyers worried it could break a precedent of keeping talks between the president and foreign leaders secret.\n\nTrump has acknowledged publicly that he asked Zelensky to investigate Biden\u2019s son, who served on the board of a Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company that came under scrutiny by authorities there. Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation. As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases. At the time, the Ukrainians\u2019 investigation was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.\n\n[Trump\u2019s communications with foreign leader are part of whistleblower complaint that spurred standoff between spy chief and Congress]\n\nInitially, the parameters of the whistleblower allegations were mysterious. Though whistleblower complaints to the intelligence community inspector general are often forwarded to the intelligence committees in Congress, the Justice Department determined this one should not be provided to lawmakers for their review.\n\nJustice Department officials released their legal reasoning for doing so Wednesday, asserting that because the matter did not concern the \u201cfunding, administration, or operation of an intelligence community\u201d matter \u2014 but instead was an allegation of possible criminal conduct by the commander in chief \u2014 it should be more properly handled as a criminal referral.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel also noted that the whistleblower\u2019s information was secondhand, based on the concerns of unidentified White House officials familiar with what Trump said on the call, and that the inspector general had found \u201csome indicia of an arguable political bias on the part of the Complainant in favor of a rival political candidate.\u201d\n\nTrump has denied doing anything improper, but lawmakers have raised concerns about his directive to freeze nearly $400 million in military assistance for Ukraine in the days leading up the phone call with Zelensky.\n\n[Trump ordered hold on military aid days before calling Ukrainian president]\n\nOn Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced she was launching a formal impeachment inquiry, saying \u201cthe actions of the Trump presidency have revealed the dishonorable fact of the president\u2019s betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections.\u201d\n\nThe rapidly-escalating confrontation between the White House and Congress comes just months after Trump freed himself from the cloud of investigation led by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. Now, he is back in the crosshairs of a resurgent impeachment effort over a fresh allegation of election season misconduct.\n\n\u201cYou will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call,\u201d Trump tweeted Tuesday shortly before Pelosi\u2019s announcement. \u201cNo pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!\u201d\n\nLawmakers have demanded to see not just the memo detailing Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky, but the whistleblower complaint as well. Administration officials are discussing the possibility of providing that document to Congress in the coming days.\n\nOne senior White House official said that while the call summary was \u201cnot entirely helpful for our side,\u201d it also showed there was not an explicit quid pro quo \u2014 which could be a crime. \u201cEveryone is going to see in that transcript what they want to see,\u201d this person said, adding there were robust discussions about whether it would help or hurt Trump.", "description": "Trump agreed to release the rough transcript of his call with Volodymyr Zelensky following days of mounting pressure from Congress.", "authors": ["Devlin Barrett", "Reporter Focusing On National Security", "Law Enforcement", "Matt Zapotosky", "National Security Reporter Covering The Justice Department", "Carol D.
