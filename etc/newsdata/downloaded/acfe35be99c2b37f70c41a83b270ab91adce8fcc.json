I watched it to find out what I could learn from the master\n\nAnna Wintour is the most powerful person in fashion. Even her hair obeys her. The Vogue editor-in-chief has also just released a new online course in creativity and leadership. To be properly transformed you\u2019ll need \u00a329.99 for a month\u2019s Masterclass subscription. As the Guardian\u2019s fashion editor, I had a go, to see if I could bring some Wintouresque efficiency to my own life.\n\n\u2018Own your decisions and who you are \u2013 without apology\u2019\n\n\n\nThis, says Wintour, is the key message of the course. I try to apply it to Tuesday morning in the Guardian fashion office. Before I start, I warn the team: \u201cI\u2019m about to stop apologising every time I speak to anyone. Sorry. It\u2019s not real, it\u2019s for a piece. Sorry.\u201d\n\nMake feedback fast and direct\n\nWintour\u2019s leadership style inspired one of fiction\u2019s greatest bosses, Miranda Priestly. (See: \u201cBy all means, move at a glacial pace. You know how that thrills me\u201d and: \u201cFlorals? For spring? Groundbreaking\u201d). The real Wintour, however, believes managers should be clear to be kind: \u201cPeople work so much better when feedback is fast, direct and honest and they know where they are,\u201d she says. \u201cNobody works well when the atmosphere feels slow and lazy.\u201d\n\nI put this to the test on Tuesday, when my colleagues, Leah and Helen, noticed a spider brooch Lady Hale was wearing at the supreme court. In other words: breaking fashion news (category: jewellery and accessories). Instead of discussing at length whether we should cover it, I went with my first instinct. Yes! Of course we should! Within two hours it was live on the website.\n\nWake up between 4am and 5.30am\n\nNow this is something we have in common \u2013 thanks to my one-year-old son. Wintour isn\u2019t blearily shoving a bottle in a screaming baby\u2019s mouth and \u2013 at best \u2013 sticking on the Today programme, however. At 6.30am, she reads all American and British newspapers. At 7am, she plays tennis. She is at her desk with \u201cbreakfast\u201d (\u201cwhich is Starbucks\u201d) at around 8am. Such \u201chyperorganised\u201d behaviour allows her to \u201cremain responsive and available\u201d to her team. Still, I have questions. How does she read all of the major newspapers from two countries in half an hour? And: when does she sleep?\n\nHave a take-home bag\n\nWintour\u2019s contains proofs and articles to read, pitches and CVs to consider, and other publications to look at. So she\u2019s working all night because, admirably, she doesn\u2019t want to waste her team\u2019s time when coming back to them with decisions. So. When does she sleep?\n\nAbsorb what is happening culturally\n\nWintour cares more about what prospective employees are reading than what they are wearing. And she ensures she imbibes as much culture and life as possible herself. Theatre? Cinema? Books? So. When does she sleep?\n\n\u2018Details of your incompetence do not interest me\u2019\n\nOK, she doesn\u2019t really say this \u2013 that\u2019s another Priestly quote \u2013 but the real Wintour admits that \u201cin-depth conversations and trying to examine things from every possible angle\u201d aren\u2019t really for her. \u201cFor me, being clear and decisive has always worked.\u201d This one I can try in the office, so I do, removing all of the \u201cmaybes\u201d and \u201cwould that be OKs\u201d and \u201cahs\u201d and other self-deprecating throat-clearing from my work correspondence for a whole morning. If you\u2019ve been up since 5am \u2013 like Wintour and me \u2013 such energy-saving behaviour is liberating.", "description": "The Vogue editor-in-chief has released a video guide to creativity and leadership.
