If they are losing weight and becoming stunted it could seriously damage overall biodiversity.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Soil containing PLA \u2013 a biodegradable form of plastic \u2013 caused ryegrass to have stunted growth. Both PLA and clothing fibres caused fewer ryegrass seeds to germinate.\n\nResearchers do not know the specific reasons why plastic causes worms to lose weight.\n\nLead author Dr Bas Boots from Anglia Ruskin University said: \u201cIt may be that the response mechanisms to microplastics may be comparable in earthworms to that of the aquatic lugworms, which have been previously studied.\n\n\u201cThese effects include the obstruction and irritation of the digestive tract, limiting the absorption of nutrients and reducing growth.\u201d\n\nWorms are vital to the balance of the ecosystem, creating pores in the earth through which oxygen and water enters, and carbon dioxide leaves. Their faeces are also very important and are responsible for the fine crumb structure in some soils.\n\nDr Boots said: \u201cEnvironmental contamination by microplastics is now considered an emerging threat to biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.\n\n\u201cSoil ecosystems \u2013 particularly agricultural land \u2013 have been recognised as a major sink of microplastics but the impacts of microplastics on soil ecosystems \u2013 such as above and below ground \u2013 remain largely unknown.\n\n\u201cThis study provides evidence microplastics manufactured of HDPE and PLA, and synthetic fibres, can affect the development of grass and the health of earthworms and crucial soil properties with potential further impacts on soil ecosystem functioning.\u201d", "description": "The damaging effect\u00a0of plastic waste\u00a0in the ocean\u00a0is\u00a0well-documented but new research shows this polluting material\u00a0could also make soils significantly less fertile.\u00a0 Scientists have found microplastics\u00a0stunt\u00a0the growth of worms, which could have serious impacts on entire ecosystems and inhibit the growth of crops that feed humans.", "authors": ["Phoebe Weston"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/11/13/istock-963303330.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
