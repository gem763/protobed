Let's not exclude that,' Dr Brecht said.\n\n'If we're talking about recidivists, who do it quite regularly ... it can also be a 'get back' (at someone).\n\n'Something has happened and \"cop this\". It's kind of, \"I'm going to poo all over you''.'\n\nDr Brecht said a more 'alarming' explanation is the result of an obsessive-compulsive or anxiety disorder.\n\nClinical psychologist Dr Grant Brecht says there are several possible reasons for the phenomenon\n\n'(That is) where a person believes if they don't do this, if they don't continue to do it, something bad is going to happen to them or a family member.\n\n'Or they'll bring bad luck on themselves or others and then get these compulsive thoughts and obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviours around needing to do this in the same spot everyday.\n\n'It's a similar sport of thing to people not wanting to step on cracks, a superstitious thing.'\n\nA third explanation is Ms Jacenko's theory - that the 'poo joggers' enjoy the sheer thrill, or relief, from the brazen act.\n\n'They take a risk and they get a buzz,' said Dr Brecht.\n\n'It can have that element, as does any sort of addictive behaviour associated with an emotional and physiological high.\n\n'They get an adrenalin rush - it's like having an gambling addiction or a sex addiction.'\n\nLast June, a man who repeatedly defecated near a Brisbane apartment block was identified as corporate executive Andrew Douglas Macintosh\n\nSeveral people have caused a stink with similar acts in recent years.\n\nA Brisbane executive was fined by police and quit his job after he was pictured defecating outside a city apartment block last year.\n\nAndrew Douglas Macintosh never publicly explained the behaviour, which ended after he was confronted by fed up residents of the unit block.\n\nIn the United States, a Colorado woman was dubbed 'the Mad Pooper' for leaving her excrement outside various homes in the summer of 2017.\n\nThe woman was never identified. A separate poo-jogger, known as 'the s*** bandit', was branded a copycat for a series of similar incidents in Arkansas.\n\nAnother Sydney woman was twice caught relieving herself outside a bottle shop in Pyrmont in June last year, but there was no allegation of jogging.\n\nShe told the Sunday Telegraph she had been suffering a medical condition, compounded by a recent death in the family.\n\n'I've been incredibly ill ... There is no way I can control it. I can't plan for it,' she told the publication.\n\nLikewise, another New South Wales 'poo bomber' was believed to be suffering mental health problems when she repeatedly left a mess at a Kmart store.\n\nThe so-called 'Pyrmont Pooper' was caught on CCTV twice defecating near a Sydney bottle shop last year\n\nIS THERE BE A PHYSICAL REASON FOR 'POO JOGGING?' When a similar incident occurred last year, Royal Melbourne Hospital's gastroenterology professor, Dr Geoff Hebbard, said physical activity can get the gut moving. 'Vigorous exercise can have significant effect on the gut although that would usually be more than a jog around the block,' Dr Hebbard explained.\n\nPsychologist Dr Brecht said that, rather than public shaming, the best way to deal with a poo jogger was to contact authorities, or 'try and front the person if you feel OK about it'.\n\n'We've just got to be careful of kneejerk reactions ... sometimes we need to take a deep breath and work it out,' he said.\n\nJacenko deleted footage of the incident from her Instagram account - which has nearly 250,000 followers - on Tuesday morning.\n\nShe told Daily Mail Australia she 'actually didn't want to look at it any longer, it's simply revolting.\n\n'I don\u2019t believe that this is a medical condition, and if it is, there are many ways to ensure that this is managed using incontinence products which are readily available rather than a street by residences, places of work and even worse a junior school.\n\nShe claimed: 'This person is looking for a thrill which is why this is happening in full daylight, multiple times a week in the SAME spot. We aren't talking about a one off, this is a repeat offender.'\n\nDefecating in public is a type of offensive conduct in New South Wales and carries a maximum penalty of three months' imprisonment and/or a $660 fine.
