First the meeting was kicked back to 5pm and then to 7pm. Then whoever was in charge of its timing stopped bothering to officially update the start time.\n\nOther planned briefings and updates that hinged on the contents of the great meeting shifted back with it, some pushed into Thursday and some disappearing altogether into the mists of the Brussels machine, never to be heard from again.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nWith negotiators in their metaphorical \u201ctunnel\u201d and the details of talks under wraps, what news did emerge from the fifth floor of the Berlaymont where talks were taking place was sketchy at best. Different sources blew hot and cold at different times. At one point the experience was enough to provoke an outburst from DUP leader Arlene Foster, who took to Twitter to castigate a respected Irish journalist\u2019s EU sources for \u201ctalking nonsense\u201d.\n\nMost diplomats were frank: \u201cI have no idea where we stand at all because we just don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll have to see what we get from Michel Barnier,\u201d one said.\n\nBut overall, the noises throughout the day tended towards the positive, which is why it didn\u2019t quite fit the narrative when ambassadors did emerge from their cocoon in the European Council\u2019s Europa building past 9pm to say there had been no deal struck.\n\nSeveral states\u2019 ambassadors had gone as far as to tell Michel Barnier they were concerned that no legal text had been finalised because their own teams needed time to scrutinise it if it is to be signed off. The main stumbling block left is on how VAT will work in Northern Ireland \u2013 an issue that hasn\u2019t got much attention until now.\n\nWork on a possible deal is continuing through the night here in Brussels: the whole city knows what floor commission talks are taking place on, because every other one has gone dark, with only a strip of fluorescent-lit windows remaining half way up. Whether that light at the end of the tunnel will turn out to be a train after all, we hope to find out before the weekend \u2013 but no one can truly say when.", "description": "Brussels on Wednesday was like waiting for a horribly late train: every time the Brexit Express looked about to pull into the station, journalists, officials, and diplomats alike would glance up at\u00a0the board and see that it was delayed by another few hours.", "authors": ["Jon Stone"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/16/20/council.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
