For Mondavi, 61, it was more, \u201cwhen did I decide I was not going to do something else.\u201d\n\nMondavi\u2019s uncle, Robert, may have the more well-known Mondavi name as the founder of Robert Mondavi Winery and as a pioneer in elevating Napa Valley to international prominence. But as his nephew points out, Charles Krug has continued to be owned and operated by his father Peter\u2019s lineage since his uncle Robert left to start his own venture after a famous disagreement with his brother in 1966.\n\nBy contrast, there are no family members currently involved in the more well-known Robert Mondavi Winery, which went public in 1994, and was sold to Constellation Brands in 2004, Mondavi says, although Robert\u2019s children have their own fine wine projects in Continuum Estate and Folio Fine Wine Partners.\n\nMondavi, who owns and runs Charles Krug today with his brother Marc, following the death of their father at age 101 in 2016, is showing appreciation for the family\u2019s wine-making history, and its decades-old practice of making vintage Cabernet, with an October release of a \u201clibrary\u201d pack of winery\u2019s Vintage Selection Cabernet with bottles dated 1979, 1989, and 2009.\n\nThe pack of three is the second offering from the Mondavi library of about 10,000 Vintage Selection Cabernets including a single bottle left from 1944, the winery\u2019s first vintage. Only 60 of the latest release package will be available at a price of $800.\n\nCharles Krug's Cold Springs vineyard in Napa Valley Charles Krug\n\nAt a recent tasting, the brightness, and finesse, of the family\u2019s food-friendly approach to wine-making remained evident, even 40 years on in a glass of the 1979 Cabernet.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re producing wine\u2014we always have\u2014that belongs on the dinner table,\u201d Mondavi says.\n\nMondavi recently spoke with Penta about his family\u2019s history, and the winery his grandfather, Cesare Mondavi, an Italian immigrant, bought in September 1943.\n\nPENTA : Was it innovative in 1944 for Charles Krug to make a vintage-dated Cabernet, a wine from a single wine variety?\n\nPETER MONDAVI, JR.: There were some wineries doing vintage dating, so I wouldn\u2019t say we were the first to do that. We always had a series of [Cabernet] lots and at one point, designating a certain lot or lots for the vintage selection/higher end [wines], as opposed to the other lots of Cabernets\u2014that was unique in that era. It took a lot of vision to do something like that, especially in a marketplace like the United States that really didn\u2019t put much weight [at the time] on quality.\n\nHow did you apply what you learned from your engineering degrees earned at Stanford, and then later, your Stanford MBA, at Charles Krug?\n\nWhen I got out [of college] around 1980, we were doing a very massive construction project here and I got heavily involved because dad actually played general manager to save money. I was not a civil engineer or an architect, but the mechanical engineering aspect helped a lot. I was immersed in that for a couple years, I actually put in a cutting-edge, temperature monitoring and control system into our fermentation tanks, because up to that point it had rudimentary mechanical thermostats. [Also] just the thought process, the analytics, and the approach to problem solving that engineering teaches one, helped throughout.\n\n[The MBA] impacted me mainly on the strategic planning side. I put a very high priority on five-year, 10-year horizons, which you need to do here: When you plant grapes, you\u2019re not going to get a crop for four more years, and then that crop will probably not be sold for another two years. And then the vines will last 20-25 years. You do have to make some long-term commitments.\n\nWhat kind of long-term changes did you make?\n\nIf you go back in time\u2014the \u201940s, \u201950s, \u201960s, \u201970s, and into the \u201980s, as well, Napa Valley was not a Bordeaux varietal-centric growing region. Sure, we had Cabernet, but we had Riesling planted, we had Chenin Blanc, we had Gamay Beaujolais Blanc, we had Gamay Beaujolais\u2014myriad varieties. Fast forward to today and we have about seven SKUs: Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Merlot, Cabernet. And then we have Generations [a Cabernet blend], and the Vintage Selections, our flagship Cabernet. Three out of the seven are Cabernet.\n\nIn \u201996-\u201997, we stopped producing all other varietals and pared it down to the core, really basically the core I just mentioned. We wiped out a lot of varietals, a lot of volume as well. The revenue and profits side was not as impacted because the ones we cut out were lower-price, lower-margin, and what we favored went to higher-price, higher-margin wines, what Napa Valley really is all about. That was that was a pretty dramatic change.\n\nYour family\u2019s approach is to make wines that go well with food. Why?\n\nThe trend is coming away from this but there has been a trend that if big is better, then bigger has to be even better yet. So people are chasing down the most opulent, ripe, and overripe Cabernets out there. Some would call them hedonistic Cabernets. My dad would call them cocktail wines. Meaning, that you have them as a cocktail before dinner, then when you come to dinner, you have a wine like our wine style that is more balanced, more reflective of the varietal itself, and the terroir its grown in, and it ties to our roots, our family roots back in Italy, where wine is a food beverage. You have wine with food.", "description": "The co-owner of Napa\u2019s Charles Krug on vintage dating in 1944, engineering, and wine with food", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-107501/social", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
