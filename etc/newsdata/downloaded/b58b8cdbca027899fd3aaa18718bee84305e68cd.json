Most problems would be solved in this phase, according to the report.\n\nSince July 2017, procuratorates across the country have delivered 182,802 pre-litigation procuratorial suggestions to administrative organs, 97.37 percent of which were responded to and implemented, the report showed.", "description": "Chinese procuratorates have stepped up their work on pre-litigation procedures in order to generate the best social effect with minimum judicial efforts, according to a report.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/24/5db11375a310cf3e97a2b7f9.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
