This growth mirrors the world\u2019s soaring population in the same period, with Catholics hovering around 17% of the total population throughout. Despite unchanged global representation, Catholic geographic distribution has altered dramatically, with massive growth sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia and waning numbers in Europe.\n\nAs of 2015, Europe had 267 million total Catholics, second only to South America\u2013home to the most populous Catholic country, Brazil\u2013with 335 million faithful. But Europe is the only continent that will see a shrinking Catholic population in the coming years, according to projections by the World Christian Database. By 2030, Catholics in North America and Africa will soar past European estimates. African Catholics will even pass their peers in South America, with 450 million followers by 2050.\n\nDeclining numbers in Europe largely reflect low birth rates. Take Spain for example, where 1.43 children are born per woman in 2014, compared with 4.8 children per woman in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Growth in Southeast Asia follows a similar trend, like in the Philippines where 3 woman are born on average to each women.\n\nIn the United States, about a quarter of the population has remained Catholic for several decades, shows a 2013 Pew Research Center report. In 2015, 73.6 million U.S. Catholics made up 6% of those faithful to Francis worldwide.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://timeinclabs.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/pope-vatican-diplomacy.jpg?quality=75&strip=color"}
