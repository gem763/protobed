It was only after uploading the video and seeing feedback about the organization that he admitted he \u201cdidn\u2019t know a lot of things that surfaced throughout this whole thing about the charity.\u201d He made the original announcement during an unboxing of a special YouTube Play button to celebrate surpassing 100 million subscribers.\n\nThe ADL once criticized PewDiePie over anti-Semitic content\n\n\u201cI made the mistake of picking a charity that I was advised to instead of picking a charity that I\u2019m personally passionate about,\u201d Kjellberg said in the video. \u201cWhich is 100 percent my fault.\u201d\n\nKjellberg previously addressed the criticism against his donation in a recently deleted tweet, acknowledging that \u201cmaking a donation to the ADL doesn\u2019t make sense to everyone, especially since they\u2019ve outright spoken against me.\u201d A spokesperson for the ADL told The Verge at the time that they learned about the \u201cpotential donation when everyone else did: when he made the announcement on his channel yesterday.\u201d\n\nThe original announcement about his donation to the ADL comes after Kjellberg stated he wanted to move past his former controversies. Kjellberg first drew global criticism for paying two men on Fiverr to hold up a sign with anti-Semitic imagery in February 2017. He was then caught using a racist expletive during a gaming live stream on YouTube. Most recently, he tried to distance himself from a popular meme, known as \u201cSubscribe to PewDiePie,\u201d after it was used in the Christchurch terrorist attack in New Zealand earlier this year.\n\nKjellberg said he\u2019s still going to donate the $50,000, which he received as a sponsorship from Honey. He hasn\u2019t announced which charity will receive the money, but said he plans to take his time with it. The Verge has reached out to Kjellberg\u2019s team for further comment.\n\nUpdate (September 12th 1:40pm ET): A representative from the ADL pointed The Verge to the organization\u2019s previous statement, given yesterday. It can be read in full below.\n\n\u201cADL learned about the potential donation from Felix Kjellberg when everyone else did: when he made the announcement on his channel earlier this week. We have not received any communication from him beyond that.\u201d", "description": "YouTube creator Felix \"PewDiePie\" Kjellberg is pulling a $50,000 donation to the ADL after receiving backlash on Twitter.
