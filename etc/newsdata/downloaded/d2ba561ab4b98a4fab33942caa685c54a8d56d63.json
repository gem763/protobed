Awz is led by Founder & Managing Partner, Yaron Ashkenazi, and Advisory Committee President, the Rt. Hon. Stephen J. Harper, Canada\u2019s 22nd Prime Minister.\n\nEnsureDR is a pioneering recovery readiness solution that identifies and fixes Disaster Recovery Plan problems prior to a disaster by automatically operating and testing the secondary sites on a weekly basis.\n\nEnsureDR protects global organizations in the financial services, technology, manufacturing, healthcare, and government sectors. EnsureDR automatically turns on servers, applications, databases, resources, web portals, and connects the environment to the network. With EnsureDR, organizations can completely evaluate, audit, and accurately assess their disaster recovery plans; they can resolve business recovery problems prior to an actual disaster.\n\nYaron Ashkenazi, Founder & Managing Partner of Awz Ventures remarked, \u201cEnsureDR is a revolutionary solution for all private sector entities which need visibility into their disaster recovery status. We have immense confidence in EnsureDR\u2019s founders and team to continue to develop market-leading tools for industry professionals to monitor and maintain their disaster readiness plans. EnsureDR will add a new layer of safety, stability, and continuity to companies around the world.\u201d\n\nUri Shay, CEO of EnsureDR said, \u201cCurrently, Disaster Recovery solutions are based on replication from the primary site to the secondary site. But that is missing the major aspect of recovery: making sure businesses can continue to function from a working secondary site. In reality, over 40% of disaster recovery downtime is caused by replication incompatibility between the primary and secondary sites.\u201d\n\nShay stated, \u201cThe EnsureDR Recovery Readiness Score will position EnsureDR as the Recovery Readiness standard. Testing and exercising are the most important stages of disaster recovery and business continuity planning; the EnsureDR Recovery Ready Platform automates the testing & exercising phase. Having an automatically tested, audited, and verified disaster recovery plan is necessary for a business\u2019s survival. You don\u2019t get second chances when disaster strikes.\u201d\n\nAbout EnsureDR\n\nFounded in 2018, EnsureDR is a pioneering Recovery Readiness software.
