Houston went on to take a 2-1 lead in the best-of-seven series.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think fans realize when they do that that you could hit a player. You hit a baseball player with a baseball from the third deck, it\u2019s got a little bit of movement on it so it can definitely do some damage to you and it\u2019s frustrating to see as a player in the outfield,\u201d Reddick said. \u201cI saw water bottles and like two baseballs. There were two souvenir baseballs thrown in center and left field. I got all the water bottles in right.\u201d\n\nReddick homered off Luis Severino in the second inning for a 2-0 lead. Fans directed insults at him when he went to right field.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of all kinds of different things here, but you\u2019re used to that for nine innings. Pretty standard,\u201d Reddick said. \u201cThey\u2019re all yelling at the same time, so it all kind of mumbles together.\u201d\n\nRestless Yankees fans cheered when Luis Cessa hit Alex Bregman on the back with a 92 mph fastball in the ninth.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Houston Astros right fielder Josh Reddick called out Yankees fans for tossing water bottles, baseballs and other objects on the field during New York's 4-1 loss in the AL Championship Series on Tuesday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Scott Orgera"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/15/alcs_astros_yankees_baseball_68928_c0-158-3789-2368_s1200x700.jpg?34c3928fc2697e28d237a6d7cdf8f1ee17544a8b", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
