He\u2019s playing week in, week out, which is important, and I think he\u2019s got the right people around him, like Mark Noble, who has been there a long time, so he\u2019ll learn a lot.\n\n\"But stop quoting these ridiculous prices, it\u2019s madness, it really is.\"\n\nInce had some advice as to how Rice could improve, saying: \"In two or three years' time, maybe, but he\u2019s still got a lot to learn, he\u2019s still got to grow, be a lot more powerful and get up and down the park quicker than he does.\n\n(Image: Sunday Mirror)\n\n\"That will come as his body develops more but he\u2019s still got to get himself in the box, got to score goals. That\u2019s going to be worth \u00a380-90m, so if he can learn that as he grows older, why not?\"\n\nOther players said to be United targets include Juventus striker Mario Mandzukic, Aston Villa midfielder John McGinn, Leicester attacking midfielder James Maddison, Bournemouth striker Callum Wilson, Lyon forward Moussa Dembele and Barcelona midfielder Ivan Rakitic.", "description": "Former United and West Ham midfielder Ince reckons London Stadium is still the right place for 20-year-old Rice", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Empics Sport", "Sunday Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20332205.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_West-Ham-United-v-Manchester-United-Premier-League-London-Stadium.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
