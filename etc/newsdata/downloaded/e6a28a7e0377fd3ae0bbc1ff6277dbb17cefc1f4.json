Fine -- get the bill through first in order to take no deal off the table.\"\n\nOutside parliament, anti-Brexit protesters gathered.\n\n\"Coming out of the EU with no deal at all is the worst possible option,\" said John Wetherall, a retired chemical engineer carrying EU flags.\n\n- New Brexit funds -\n\nJohnson insists his threat to leave the EU without a deal will ultimately force the bloc to sign up to new terms to ease the end of Britain's 46-year membership.\n\nBut his critics warn this is wishful thinking, while governments on both sides of the Channel are stepping up preparations for a disorderly divorce.\n\nJohnson's finance minister on Tuesday announced another \u00a32 billion (2.2 billion euros, $2.4 billion) of funding to deal with Brexit, to be spent on boosting border guards and port infrastructure.\n\nLeaked government assessments have warned that no-deal could lead to food, fuel and medicine shortages, but ministers insist they can prepare for much of this.\n\nUN economists also on Tuesday warned that Britain could lose at least $16 billion (14.6 billion euros) a year on exports to the European Union if it left without a deal.\n\nOn a day of high drama, an Edinburgh court also heard a legal challenge against Johnson's decision to suspend parliament next week for more than a month, with the ruling expected Wednesday.", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson raised the prospect of a snap election on Tuesday after he suffered a major parliamentary defeat over his Brexit strategy that could delay Britain's exit from the European Union.
