(Photo by Logan Stanford/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)\n\nA Florida State booster and his 4-year-old son spent their Sunday working together on a project. You could even say it was a school project.\n\nGrayton Grant set up a \u201cFree Willie\u201d lemonade stand in Tallahassee to help pay Seminoles coach Willie Taggart\u2019s $17 million buyout after FSU\u2019s disastrous loss to No. 25 Virginia.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nHis father, FSU graduate and Platinum Chief level donor Daniel Grant, matched the total and sent off the check to close out a teachable lesson that may have gone too far.\n\nGrayton set up shop with a sign signaling all proceeds would go toward buying out the head coach\u2019s contract \u2014 which is a lot of lemonade, even at his prices. Per the Tallahassee Democrat, he charged $20 per cup in the 90-degree heat.\n\nHe raised $241 thanks to a $100 donation by one customer, per the Democrat.\n\nThe \u201cFree Willie\u201d lemonade stand raised $241 in just under three hours. https://t.co/o7lder6ttO \u2014 Tallahassee Democrat (@TDOnline) September 15, 2019\n\nDaniel Grant, who donates between $13,000 and $24,999 a year to FSU, matched his earnings. They sent a $482 check to the Seminole Boosters along with a letter from Grayton.\n\nVia the Tallahassee Democrat:\n\nIt explained that \u201cI am tired of losing football games and being made fun of at school for being a Seminole fan. At four, I am already starting to gravitate towards the color orange. You don\u2019t want that for an innocent kid like me\u2026.\u201d\n\nThe letter closed with \u201cI hope this helps other Noles fan (sic) have hope that we can once again have a football team and program to be proud of!\u201d\n\nGrayton\u2019s signature, though illegible, was made with an orange marker.\n\nStory continues\n\nTaggart is in the second season of a six-year contract that pays $30 million. In 2018, the Seminoles missed a bowl game for the first time in 36 years following a 5-7 record. It hasn\u2019t gone much better this year. They\u2019re 1-2 and looked dysfunctional in Saturday\u2019s loss.\n\nThe lemonade stand was apparently a teachable moment. Daniel Grant told the Democrat he was complaining throughout the game. He talked to Grayson about how a person can\u2019t complain and \u201cnot try to pitch in and help fix it.\u201d\n\nHis wife, Jamie, maybe didn\u2019t quite have this in mind.\n\n\"A simple lesson of not being a complainer sure escalated quickly,\u201d she said.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The lemonade stand was a \"teaching moment\" for the 4-year-old, according to his donor dad.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/HQyZLzzX4f.tJREdU6OmWA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Y5hs_Qk56js1r_CKi6qYCQ--~B/aD0zMjA5O3c9NDgxNDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/d7728b20-d88c-11e9-baff-ef60046b26ba", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
