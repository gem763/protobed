They were dropped by prosecutors in 2009, shortly before Zuma became president, and reinstated in 2016.\n\nThales said in a statement that it \u201cnotes the decision of the High Court\u201d and was assessing its legal options.\n\nPolitical analyst Xolani Dube warned that Zuma could lodge an \u201curgent\u201d appeal.\n\n\u201cThere are also other avenues that the man might still use\u2026 he can still appeal so it\u2019s still going to drag,\u201d Dube told AFP, adding that the country may \u201cnot yet see him facing his alleged deeds\u201d.\n\nZuma, 77, claimed last year that he was so broke that he had to sell his socks to raise legal fees, after another court ruled he should front the bills.\n\nThe ANC party forced him to resign last year over a separate corruption scandal centred around the wealthy Gupta business family, who won lucrative contracts with state companies and allegedly held sway over his choice of cabinet ministers.\n\nThe court\u2019s ruling on Friday came just a day after the US Treasury slapped sanctions on the three Indian-born Gupta brothers, calling them a \u201csignificant corruption network\u201d that dispersed bribes and misappropriated millions in state funds.\n\nZuma also appeared before a judicial inquiry in July that is probing allegations he organised a systematic plunder of government coffers in a scandal known as \u201cstate capture\u201d.\n\nA few days later he pulled out of the inquiry saying that he had been \u201ctreated as someone who was accused\u201d. But he later agreed to return at a future date.", "description": "Pietermaritzburg (South Africa) (AFP) \u2013 South Africa\u2019s scandal-plagued former president Jacob Zuma will face a corruption trial, a court ruled", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/11/5de16a_south-african-president-jacob-zuma-pictured-friday-high-court-africa-ex-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
