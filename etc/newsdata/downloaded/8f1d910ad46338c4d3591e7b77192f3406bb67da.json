Sandys/The Washington Post)\n\nThere are plenty of good seats available, but if you\u2019re not planning to attend Wednesday\u2019s matinee series finale between the Washington Nationals and New York Mets, all you\u2019ll need to watch the game is a device with an Internet connection. The National League East showdown will be broadcast exclusively on YouTube as part of Major League Baseball\u2019s 13-game trial package with the Google-owned platform.\n\nMLB Network\u2019s Scott Braun will handle play-by-play duties; MASN Nationals analyst F.P. Santangelo and MLB Network analyst Al Leiter will provide color commentary for the game, which will not be shown live on MASN, MLB.tv or any other platform. MLB Network\u2019s Lauren Shehadi, a McLean native, will provide additional reporting from Nationals Park. The radio broadcast will be on 106.7 the Fan as usual.\n\nCoverage for Wednesday\u2019s 1:05 p.m. game, YouTube\u2019s ninth exclusive broadcast this season and the first to feature the Nationals or Mets, will begin at 12:30 p.m. with a pregame show hosted by Robert Flores and Mark DeRosa from MLB Network\u2019s studio in New Jersey. Washington\u2019s game against the Atlanta Braves on Sept. 13 is also slated to be broadcast on YouTube, but that game will also air locally on MASN, according to the network\u2019s website.\n\nLast year, Facebook aired 25 MLB games exclusively. Unlike that arrangement, which required viewers to have a Facebook account, YouTube games are available free on any device without having to log in. Simply go to YouTube.com/MLB or search \u201cMLB\u201d in the YouTube app.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve tried to make it very, very easy for fans to find the ubiquity of devices that YouTube is available on,\u201d said YouTube\u2019s head of sports partnerships, Tim Katz, in a phone interview. \u201cFrom my perspective, it should be easier than watching a normal game, because you don\u2019t have to subscribe to anything. As long as you have an Internet connection, you can access these games.\u201d\n\nUnlike traditional TV broadcasts, YouTube\u2019s MLB broadcasts don\u2019t feature commercial breaks between innings or during pitching changes. Instead, viewers of Wednesday\u2019s game can expect to see live and recorded player interviews, highlights and various Nationals and Mets YouTube content. There\u2019s also a live chat featuring social media representatives from both teams and popular YouTube creators, such as Jimmy \u201cJomboy\u201d O\u2019Brien, whose baseball breakdowns have gone viral this season.\n\nKatz said he has been pleased with the results of the partnership thus far. Last week\u2019s Braves-Colorado Rockies game has more than 900,000 views, while the Los Angeles Dodgers\u2019 win over the St. Louis Cardinals on Aug. 7 has more than 1.6 million views.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting a lot of core fans that are watching baseball on a daily basis and we\u2019re bringing in new fans by virtue of our platform, being a little younger than television,\u201d Katz said. \u201c \u2026 We\u2019re also seeing a lot of fans watching from outside the U.S., and that\u2019s been really fun to see.\"\n\nHow to access Wednesday\u2019s Nationals-Mets game broadcast:\n\nThere are no fees or sign-ups required and you do not need a YouTube account to access the game.\n\nMobile\n\n1.
