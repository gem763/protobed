After heated exchanges in parliament last Wednesday he rejected pleas to tone down his language from female MPs who invoked the memory of their murdered colleague Jo Cox and said they increasingly feared for their safety as Brexit tensions rose in their constituencies.\n\nStarmer told the Observer that Downing St\u2019s strategy was clear \u2013 to stoke tensions \u2013 but warned Johnson that any attempt to invoke the Civil Contingencies Act would be defeated in the courts.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer. Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA\n\n\u201cWhipping up the idea of riots or even deaths if we do not leave the EU on 31 October is the height of irresponsibility,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is also pretty obviously being orchestrated. If this is part of a government plan to misuse powers under emergency legislation, I can assure the prime minister we will defeat him in court and in parliament.\u201d\n\nJohnson is expected to continue his attacks on Remainers this week at the Tory party conference in Manchester where the slogan will be \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d.\n\nFormer Tory MP and attorney general Dominic Grieve said he could see no other possible way Downing Street could comply with the law and deliver Brexit on time. \u201cThe Civil Contingencies Act is the only possible route I can imagine they can be thinking of,\u201d Grieve said. \u201cBut if they do try to do this it would be a constitutional outrage. And if it passed through parliament it would be immediately challenged in the courts.\u201d\n\nAllies of Johnson have warned in recent days that the UK will face civil disorder on the scale of the gilets jaunes protests in France if Brexit was to be delayed or reversed.\n\nSenior Labour sources said that possible use of the Civil Contingencies Act to trump the Benn act was on a list of options that the party\u2019s legal advisers believe Downing Street might use.\n\nAfter 11 supreme court judges ruled unanimously last week that Johnson\u2019s decision to shut parliament for five weeks had been unlawful and declared prorogation null and void, MPs say there are signs of increasing desperation at No 10 as it faces the prospects of more defeats in both parliament and the courts.\n\nSome minor parties are pressing hard to pass a motion censuring Johnson, forcing him to apologise for the language he has used against his Brexit opponents. Plaid Cymru\u2019s Liz Saville-Roberts has even asked Speaker John Bercow whether she can table a motion to impeach Johnson. Another avenue being examined is to censure Johnson should he appear before the liaison committee of MPs.\n\nLast week the former Tory prime minister John Major said he feared the Johnson government would try to bypass the Benn Act through an order of council. \u201cIt is important to note that an order of council can be passed by privy councillors \u2013 that is government ministers \u2013 without involving HM the Queen,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI should warn the prime minister that \u2013 if this route is taken \u2013 it will be in flagrant defiance of parliament and utterly disrespectful to the supreme court. It would be a piece of political chicanery that no one should ever forgive or forget.\u201d\n\nThe Civil Contingencies Act provides the government with powers to create emergency regulations at times of national crisis and threats to safety (including wartime), emergencies that threaten \u201cserious damage to human welfare\u201d, or to the environment or the security of the UK. Damage to human welfare is defined in the act to include disruption to transport networks or to the supply of food, money, energy, or health services.\n\nDowning St sources said it was not planning to use the Civil Contingencies Act. A spokesman added: \u201cThe prime minister is determined to deliver Brexit on time and he will abide by the law.\u201d\n\nSenior Labour sources played down suggestions by the Scottish National party that the opposition parties could this week table a vote no confidence in Boris Johnson\u2019s government, with a view to installing a caretaker administration led by Jeremy Corbyn who would then apply for an extension to Brexit and call an election.\n\nWhile Labour is not publicly ruling out the move, shadow cabinet members privately say they will only move once an extension to Brexit has been guaranteed. The Liberal Democrats and other opposition parties, as well as former Tory MPs and independents, say they will not under any circumstances agree to install Corbyn in Downing Street, even temporarily.\n\nAnna Soubry, leader of the Independent Group for Change, which has five MPs, said: \u201cWe need to keep the prime minister held firmly accountable for the mess he has created. We do not want any votes of no confidence until that extension is up and running and even then I will only support a vote of no confidence knowing that it will result in a government of national unity resulting in a people\u2019s vote confirmatory referendum.\n\n\u201cAnything else gives Johnson his escape route. His only plan B is a general election and a general election would not solve Brexit. Only a referendum will sort out Brexit.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday the Liberal Democrats announced that Dr Phillip Lee, who recently defected from the Tories, will be their candidate to fight the veteran Tory and hard-line Brexiter John Redwood in Wokingham, to set up a Leave v Remain contest in the Berkshire seat.", "description": "Labour claims that PM is aiming to invoke emergency powers using the Civil Contingencies Act", "authors": ["Michael Savage"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/303ea61684a236d8a0351142b13c5176b599d710/0_132_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=45b43a25ce391f28c922b7df550dff22", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
