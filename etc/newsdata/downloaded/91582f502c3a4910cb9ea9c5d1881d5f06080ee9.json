The nose-to-tail philosophy, coined by chef Fergus Henderson to celebrate cooking all parts of land animals, has become widely accepted.\n\nNow, innovative eco-conscious chefs are diving into the next phase, \"gills-to-fin\" cooking, using every morsel of the sea\u2019s bounty, not just the prime cuts.\n\nThey\u2019re turning bones, heads, offal and other fishy bits that many of us don\u2019t realise are edible into dazzling dishes often more delicious than plates using familiar cuts like fillets.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nCrucially, gills-to-fin cooking also reduces waste and stretches precious sea life further, an approach that\u2019s now imperative.\n\nThe WWF reports a 39 per cent decline in recorded marine species over the past 40 years, and almost 30 per cent of commercial fish stocks are over-fished. To compound this, so much of what is caught is wasted.\n\nFor example, Seafish UK says the fillets on cod and haddock make up just 50 per cent of their weight \u2013 the rest is often discarded by processors and used for fishmeal (to feed farmed fish).\n\n\u201cIf we want to continue to enjoy these amazing gifts from nature, we\u2019re going to have to try a bit harder and use all of it,\u201d says Jan Ostle, chef proprietor of acclaimed Bristol restaurant, Wilsons.\n\nOstle uses all parts of fish and shellfish on his menu and is especially passionate about flavourful but pricey turbot.\n\n\u201cOnly 40 per cent of the whole fish will end up on the plate once you\u2019ve taken the fillet off, skinned it and removed the bones,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cPurely from a business point of view, that\u2019s bloody disastrous. But you can make a five course meal out of a turbot if you want to.\u201d\n\nOstle\u2019s menu is swimming with dishes that utilise undervalued seafood parts.\n\nTurbot served with malted sourdough is made from the heads, for example.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Already in a consumer\u2019s eyes without talking to someone, a conclusion is drawn that it\u2019s mullet and must taste like the earthy, muddy and often \"fishy\" fish that they may have grown up eating.\n\n\n\nContrary to this, knowing that the diet of red mullet is rich in crustaceans will give us the knowledge that the fish also has a flavour profile reminiscent of lobster, crab or prawn (shrimp). A conversation when purchasing fish with the individuals handling or selling it will help guide you in the right direction.\n\nThe deliciousness of these cuts usually regarded as scraps underscores just how much good eating and flavour can end up in the bin.\n\nThe thing is, the British have a tricky relationship with seafood.\n\nAmazingly, more than 150 species of fish are caught in waters surrounding the UK, according to the Marine Conservation Society (MCS).\n\nAnd yet we\u2019re wedded to cod, haddock, salmon, prawns and tuna, which make up about 60-75 per cent of the seafood we eat.\n\nIf we\u2019re not prepared to widen the net of fish we eat, will we tuck into the challenging cuts?\n\nCertainly, adventurous food lovers are enraptured by the trend: just peer into Instagram.\n\nDiners at Flor, James Lowe\u2019s new Borough Market spin-off of his Shoreditch restaurant, Lyle\u2019s, adore the scarlet prawns. And the heads are the extraordinary part.\n\nJust as they do in Spain, Lowe grills them, leaving just enough meat in the neck to stop the juices escaping. The result? A flood of flavour when you bite in, which Lowe aptly describes as a cross between foie gras and bisque.\n\nHe serves the heads separately to the raw tails, on their own little plate. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to celebrate them,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want customers to know how special they are.\u201d Meanwhile, over at London restaurant Brat, hake throat is now one of chef Tomos Parry\u2019s signature dishes.\n\nDry handling If you purchase your fish whole, ask the assistant to scale and gut it without the use of water.\n\nIf this is declined then it is best to scale and gut the fish yourself at home.\n\nIt is a common assumption that gutting and scaling a fish at home will cause it to stink for weeks, but if handled correctly, the fish will smell less than one that has already been washed with tap water and wrapped in plastic for the car trip home.\n\nRich Adams, founder of Forgotten Fish, a gills-to-fin fish supplier, says British restaurants can\u2019t get enough of unused, unknown and underrated cuts at the moment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gone crazy,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t keep up with the requests.\u201d The problem is, most fish processors are set up to treat these cuts as waste, not for human consumption, and he hopes this will change.\n\nPrawn on the Lawn, the seafood restaurant and fishmonger with branches in Islington and Padstow, started serving \u201cweird and more adventurous cuts\u201d a couple of years ago.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do it in an obvious way to start with,\u201d says chef and co-founder Rick Toogood. \u201cA ray wing salad, the cheeks and some meat from the tail poached and shredded.\u201d\n\nBut the global conversation about sustainable food has since grown louder and more restaurants are serving unusual cuts. \u201cThat\u2019s meant we can push people a little but further into things like collars and heads,\u201d Toogood says.\n\nAfter eating dishes using both these cuts at Prawn on the Lawn recently I would order them over fillets any day.\n\nThe collar (described on the menu as wing because some customers are a bit put off by the term), is cooked on the bone and intensely flavourful and meaty \u2013 not fishy at all.\n\nThe brill head was also a rich, sticky and delicious feast: grilled on the plancha, then roasted and served with a soy and mirin butter it was a bit like eating a fine piece of pork belly.\n\nCustomers often need advice on how to tackle the head.\n\n\u201cWe tell them, just go for it, use your hands. Any of the soft bits are good for eating,\u201d Toogood says. Others are a bit squeamish\n\n\u201cPeople have lost touch with where their food comes from.\n\nIf you buy your fish at the supermarket wrapped in plastic, it\u2019s not surprising it\u2019s a bit of a leap to eat the head.\u201d\n\nBut he urges home cooks to overcome this and try serving unloved cuts at home.\n\n\u201cThe amount of meat you get on a whole cod\u2019s head is probably similar to a whole roast chicken,\u201d he says. \u201cYou could serve it as a centrepiece where everyone tucks in.\u201d\n\nIf that sounds a bit outr\u00e9, it\u2019s actually quite tame by the standards of Josh Niland, chef proprietor of Saint Peter restaurant and The Fish Butchery in Sydney, who\u2019s credited with starting the gills-to-fin trend, including ageing, curing and smoking fish for seafood charcuterie.\n\nNiland\u2019s won a brace of awards and a crowd of celebrity acolytes including Rick Stein, Heston Blumenthal and Nigella Lawson.\n\nEvery chef I spoke to about gills-to-fin cooking can\u2019t wait to get their hands on Niland\u2019s cook book, The Whole Fish (Hardie Grant, September 12, \u00a325), in which he explores ways to unlock \u201cthe untapped potential\u201d of fish.\n\nThink crispy crunchy deep fried fish eyes and scales, sausages made from fish throat and tongue, and black pudding made with fish blood.\n\nTake a deep breath and inhale the sea air, because this is the future.\n\nSue Quinn is the author of 'Cocoa: An exploration of chocolate'", "description": "The winds of sustainable eating have turned seaward.
