Eight times! The only time it makes sense to ask for the same thing eight times in a single phone call is if you\u2019re trying to connect with a customer-service agent for AT&T,\u201d cracked Oliver. \u201cBoom! I got you, Business Daddy, I got you! You genuinely bad company!\u201d (AT&T is the owner of WarnerMedia, HBO\u2019s parent company.)\n\n\u201cBasically, [Trump] is accused of withholding nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine and then using it as leverage to get dirt on Joe Biden. It is very, very dumb. And you might remember, we called his Russia scandal \u2018Stupid Watergate,\u2019 which unfortunately means that we now have to work out what this sequel should be called,\u201d Oliver continued, eventually landing on the name \u201cStupid Watergate II: The Stupidest Watergate.\u201d\n\nTo make matters worse for Trump, the whistleblower\u2019s complaint alleges that senior White House officials intervened to \u201clock down\u201d all records of the call because they were convinced \u201cthat they had witnessed the President abuse his office for personal gain.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true: The notes from the call were stored in a separate code word-level system meant for highly classified information despite the fact that there was no legitimate reason to do that. And why do that if there wasn\u2019t something very bad in there?\u201d asked Oliver.\n\nGiven that the House has finally opened an impeachment inquiry into Trump, and even a few Republicans seem to be \u201ctreading with caution for a change,\u201d Oliver wondered why things might be different this time around given the laundry list of troubling allegations levied at Trump.\n\n\u201cUnlike the Mueller Report\u2019s legalistic descriptions of obstruction of justice, Trump pressuring Ukraine to get dirt on his opponent and then hiding the conversation is easy to understand. It\u2019s just gettable. You don\u2019t need to know any more than that to know it\u2019s something presidents absolutely should not be able to do,\u201d Oliver explained, adding, \u201cThis particular Trump scandal does start to feel a little different, and something that is absolutely meriting of impeachment\u2014especially because the fact that it is so consistent with all of Trump\u2019s other behavior suggests that it is a pattern that will continue until he leaves office, one way or another.\u201d", "description": "The \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d host argued that it\u2019s \u201cdifferent\u201d this time.", "authors": ["Marlow Stern", "Senior Entertainment Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_206/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569815989/150413_ff_johnoliver_wv3yq0_qtteas", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
