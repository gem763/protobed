There will not be a birthday cake but I can still drink beer, so I am happy.\u201d\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nMissing out on the cake will be worth it as he insists his new diet has given him more energy and he now feels better than ever.\n\nSimon said: \u201cI went on this diet and it has worked and I feel better. It hasn\u2019t been difficult for me but the difference I feel in 12 months is unbelievable \u2013 mentally as well.\n\n\u201cMemory, my clarity, sleeping better, feeling better. I mean, it \u00adactually genuinely does work and then you become very aware of what you are putting in your body. So it is positive.\u201d\n\nHis health drive also boosted his already strong bond with his mini-me son, Eric.\n\nSimon said: \u201cEric was a big part of it \u00adbecause he is five and I was conscious his energy, the minute he wakes up and right before bed, he is all over the place.\n\n\u201cYou want to be able to be with him in the day time and play sports with him and that was a big part of it as well. And yes, it is the best thing I have done in years. I am going to call it the Simon Diet. Definitely.\u201d\n\n(Image: REX/Shutterstock)\n\nBut while Eric has been life-changing for Simon, he and girlfriend Lauren Silverman, 42, do not plan on giving him a sibling.\n\nSimon said: \u201cI think he is quite happy as the only son right now and we have a very close relationship, we are like buddies.\n\n\u201cI tease him that he should audition for the show. He is actually a really good dancer and impressionist and not a bad singer.\n\n\u201cHe does a pretty good me and a good Terry Seymour. Naturally, he is funny. But I would love for him to be in my side of the stage and behind the desk.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine my life now without him, life is so much easier with him. I don\u2019t get stressed about anything any more.\n\nI want him to be happy and I see the show through different eyes. I have changed my diet and waking hours so I can do all the things he likes.\u201d\n\nIf Eric does join him at the desk,it may be in Sin City. Simon is eyeing a theatre of his own to expand his business empire. He has confirmed that he is working with investors to create his own site in Las Vegas, built specifically for acts from America\u2019s Got Talent to perform in.\n\nThe bold move would see his acts competing with star residencies like Aerosmith, Lady Gaga and Cher.\n\nSimon, currently filming AGT in LA, said: \u201cYeah, 100 per cent, at some stage it will happen.\n\n\u201cI think it all gears up to that but it is all about if last year\u2019s show works, if this year\u2019s show works... what year\u2019s work. But when it comes to this final, it feels like a great final. We haven\u2019t had this kind of final in years, so if we could get the talent \u00adconsistent in Vegas, we would be crazy not to.\u201d AGT has been the top primetime show in the US for the past four years.\n\nCurrently, winners get short-term residencies in Las Vegas \u2013 but this would guarantee a long-term venue.\n\n(Image: FilmMagic)\n\nOne of Simon\u2019s biggest stars is impressionist and \u00adventriloquist Terry Fator, who won AGT and landed his own slot at the Mirage. London magician and comic Piff the Magic Dragon also has his own spot at the Flamingo. Next week, Simon returns to the UK for the launch of Celebrity X Factor \u2013 with the likes of Vinnie Jones and ex-Strictly star Brendan Cole competing.\n\nAnd he insists reality shows are still \u00adrelevant, saying: \u201cYou have to remind \u00adyourself it\u2019s more than a competition, right? We get paid a lot of money to do this. For these guys, sometimes it\u2019s a one-shot. And the money actually is important.\n\n\u201cIt would be depressing if nobody did anything after winning one of these shows.\n\n\u201cYou always pray people go on and have a successful career and the track record is good. You are going to see a lot of good things happening over the next few years for these peopl. The cream rises to the top.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Simon\u2019s pal Louis Walsh poked fun at his new lifestyle \u2013 saying his transformation was kick-started by him looking like \u201cDesperate Dan\u201d.\n\nLouis, 67, said: \u201cHe looked at last year\u2019s X Factor and realised he had a fat face when he only wants a fat bank balance. Last year, he was Desperate Dan. Now he\u2019s a different person. I don\u2019t think Simon minds getting old but I don\u2019t think he wants to look old. That Carly Simon song You\u2019re So Vain was made for him. Now he looks like he did in the 80s \u2013 and still dresses like that too.\u201d\n\nLouis also said plans for his 60th bash sound toned down compared with his 40th and 50th. Guests at the lavish party for Simon\u2019s 50th at Wrotham Park, Hertfordshire, included Kate Moss, Amanda Holden and Piers Morgan.\n\nLouis said: \u201cIt was quite over the top but Philip Green had organised it. This year will be nothing as pretentious.\n\n\u201cLauren is organising it and it will be more normal with family and friends. I\u2019ve been to all his \u00adparties and I\u2019ll be at his 100th. We will both be there because Simon has found the secret of eternal youth!\u201d\n\nSimon axed Louis from X Factor last year, along with Nicole Scherzinger and Sharon Osbourne, drafting in One Direction star Louis Tomlinson and Robbie Williams with wife Ayda Field.\n\n(Image: Alpha Press)\n\nThe show\u2019s viewing figures have declined over the years, from 14 million at its peak to five million last year. But Louis is \u00adconvinced this year\u2019s celebrity version will put it back on top.\n\nLouis, who managed boy band Westlife, remains close to Simon despite his sacking. \u201cSimon has been good to me,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s given me loads of advice and a job and he\u2019s always loyal. We always have a laugh.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be walking on to the X Factor set and he\u2019ll say, \u2018Darling, try to be interesting tonight.\u2019 He makes me laugh so much.\u201d\n\nAnd Louis has underlined his loyalty to his pal by calling for Simon to be given a knighthood for his birthday. He said: \u201cI can\u2019t believe he\u2019s not a Sir.\n\n\u201cHe would love the title. He deserves it. Simon might be 60 but he won\u2019t grow old gracefully. He loves life too much.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Pal Louis Walsh jokes looking like 'Desperate Dan' prompted Simon's new health kick, and the talent show boss doesn't plan to slow down as he eyes his own theatre in Las Vegas to showcase acts", "authors": ["Halina Watts", "Grace Macaskill", "Image", "Itv", "Rex Shutterstock", "Filmmagic", "Alpha Press"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20466478.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Simon-Cowell.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
