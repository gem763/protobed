In reality, its business operations and how it paid service providers in China were similar to its worldwide operations, the SEC said.\n\nWhile Herbalife claimed it paid Chinese providers on an hourly basis, the SEC said those workers did not record their own hours or detail their work, and instead relied on pre-printed forms that assigned a certain number of hours to specific services.\n\nThe markets regulator is seeking to stamp out what it regards as inaccurate disclosures from U.S. companies on their global operations.\n\n\u201cHerbalife deprived investors of valuable information necessary to evaluate risk and make informed investment decisions,\u201d said Marc Berger, Director of the SEC\u2019s New York Regional Office. \u201cWhen making disclosures to investors, issuers must ensure that those disclosures are accurate.\u201d", "description": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said on Friday that Herbalife Nutrition Ltd. has agreed to pay $20 million to settle charges that it made false and misleading statements about its business operations in China.", "authors": ["Katanga Johnson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
