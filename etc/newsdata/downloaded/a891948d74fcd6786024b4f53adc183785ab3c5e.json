He got 11 in 2015-16, and 10 in 2018-19, scoring just four and nine in the other two seasons.\n\nHe got off to a good start this season with a goal against Chelsea and against Wolves in his first two games.\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer gave Martial back the No 9 shirt and expects more goals from him\n\nHowever, he picked up an injury against Crystal Palace back in August and has been out of action since then.\n\nNow that Romelu Lukaku has departed for Inter Milan, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will be looking to Martial to step up in the goals department if United are to improve, especially now he has taken back the iconic No 9 shirt.\n\nThey're currently in the midst of their worst start to a Premier League season for 30 years, and face league leaders Liverpool on Sunday.\n\n'Now that I've taken the No 9 shirt back once again, all he [Solskjaer] has said to me is that I have a lot of responsibility and that I have to score goals, so that's what I am trying to do,' the forward concluded.", "description": "Anthony Martial has scored 50 times in 177 appearances for Manchester United, and quite a lot of those have been impressive efforts.", "authors": ["Matt Porter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/23/19938890-0-image-a-51_1571523315186.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
