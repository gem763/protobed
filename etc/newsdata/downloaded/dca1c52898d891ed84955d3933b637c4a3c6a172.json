The inquiry found that 3,234 offenders received immediate jail terms in 2017, of which 628 were of less than a year.\n\nThe report is the third and final one of an inquiry, launched last year, by MPs on sex abuse survivors\u2019 experiences.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Others discovered via the media that convicted abusers were due to be released.\n\nSome survivors had been prevented from applying for compensation because of unspent convictions that were caused by being abused in the first place.\n\nThe report authors listed a series of recommendations, including that court staff undergo training, and that witnesses summonsed by a court have a legal right to paid leave.\n\nAll survivors of sexual violence and abuse should have an automatic right to video links to give evidence; and they should be consulted on the length of sentences, they recommended.\n\nThe Ministry of Justice has been contacted for comment.", "description": "Survivors of childhood sexual abuse are forced to come face-to-face with their tormentors in court buildings while waiting for cases to be heard, a report has revealed.
