And I just think the people are disappointed in themselves and they would have liked to do better but this is how it works.\u2019\n\nShe added that she couldn\u2019t hide her feelings about Johannes and Catherine\u2019s exit: \u2018Well, I was sad, I was sad because I see Johannes [Radebe], he\u2019s a young man from South Africa, I see what he\u2019s achieved, I loved what he did last week.\n\n\u2018I see those two, they\u2019re so close together and just seeing their sadness, it comes to you and you just let it out.\u2019\n\nFollowing the shock result, Mike also opened up about the trolling ad hateful messages he had received after being saved to dance another day.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nHe told BBC Breakfast: \u2018It\u2019s an entertainment show, we\u2019re all trying our best, you\u2019re not really competing against anybody else, you compete against yourself to try and learn to get better and better each week, even if it\u2019s just learning a couple of new steps.\n\nCatherine and Johannes were voted off on Sunday\u2019s show (Picture: BBC)\n\nMotsi couldn\u2019t hide her disappointment at the result (Picture; BBC)\n\n\u2018As a non-dancer all I can do is put the hours in, do my best and get through it. You have to rise above the abuse on social media, that\u2019s one of the sad things about social media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018All you can do is do your best, accept the judges\u2019 decision and move on. Johannes and Catherine are lovely people, I didn\u2019t want to see them go but someone has to go.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s like football \u2013 you have to accept the referee\u2019s decision. [The judges] are the best judges in the world, they do know what they\u2019re talking about, if they\u2019d sent me home that would have been the best decision, I can\u2019t get involved in any of that.\n\n\u2018I just have to concentrate on improving, and if Katya is happy with what I\u2019m doing then I\u2019m happy.\u2019\n\nThe Daily Mirror Pride of Britain Awards, in partnership with TSB, will broadcast on ITV on 5th November at 8pm.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
