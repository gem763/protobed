It\u2019s an incredibly beautiful piece, it makes me want to cry just talking about this film.\u201d\n\nAsked about mixing humor and pain in the script, Kalnejais recounted losing a friend in her 20s.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t set out to write this story, it sort of just bubbled out of me,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI guess my experience is that when people are in grief or having a really intense time they\u2019re so funny - like you have to be funny to get through it and it kind of brings you closer together.\u201d\n\nMurphy is one of just two female directors out of a total 21 competing for the festival\u2019s Golden Lion Prize.\n\nAsked about the gender disparity in the film industry, she said: \u201cIt\u2019s a real struggle always having to answer questions about being a female filmmaker.\n\n\u201cI feel like it takes away from the artistry of what we\u2019re trying to do... and it also continues the mythology of the great male director and his poetic process and we\u2019re constantly having to talk about the struggle and the hardship.\u201d", "description": "Australian director Shannon Murphy manages to bring out the humor in pain and suffering in her tear-jerking film feature debut \"Babyteeth\", a harrowing tale of a seriously ill teenage girl embracing life.", "authors": ["Marie-Louise Gumuchian", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426201057&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF831HW-OCAEN"}
