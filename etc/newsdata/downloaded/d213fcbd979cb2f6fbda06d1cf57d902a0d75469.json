The Guardian obtained a copy.\n\nThe \u201cdeep state conspiracy theory is for nut cases\u201d, Bannon is quoted as saying, because \u201cAmerica isn\u2019t Turkey or Egypt\u201d.\n\nThere is a formidable government bureaucracy in the US, he adds, but \u201cthere\u2019s nothing \u2018deep\u2019 about it. It\u2019s right in your face.\u201d\n\nBannon, a leading voice of the alt-right, left the White House in August 2017, after the president\u2019s handling of the deadly far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, came under fierce criticism.\n\nRelated: Steve Bannon plans foundation to fuel far right in Europe\n\nIn August, an unidentified member of the intelligence services filed a whistleblower\u2019s complaint about Trump\u2019s behaviour. It was processed through official channels, then withheld from Congress. On 25 September, after House speaker Nancy Pelosi announced an impeachment inquiry, the complaint was released.\n\nIt detailed concern over Trump\u2019s behaviour towards Ukraine, withholding military aid and asking for help in attempts to damage Joe Biden, a leading Democratic rival.\n\nTrump has furiously demanded the identity of the whistleblower be revealed and insinuated that he or she should be punished with death.\n\nLast weekend, as Trump surrogates joined in the furious offensive, Miller told Fox News Sunday he knew \u201cthe difference between a whistleblower and a deep state operative\u201d.\n\nMuch of the Deep State conspiracy theory\u2019s power in US politics under Trump has been generated by the far-right Breitbart website, which Bannon ran before joining the 2016 Trump campaign and after his time in the White House.\n\nOn Thursday, Breitbart published a new essay by Virgil, the pseudonymous author of the original Deep State series. The title: Lessons of Impeachment, from Watergate to Monicagate to Bidengate.\n\nIn it, the author quoted Bannon, and added: \u201cYes, this is the Deep State in action, and it\u2019s out for blood.\u201d\n\nBannon lost his role at Breitbart in January 2018, after the publication of Michael Wolff\u2019s book Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, in which he was quoted liberally.\n\nAmid reports that he could yet return to Trump\u2019s side, Bannon continues to fight over old ground. Miller was formerly an aide to Jeff Sessions, Trump\u2019s first attorney general and a frequent target of Trump\u2019s ire.\n\nAmong headline-grabbing shots loosed off in his conversations with Stewart, Bannon says he thought the firing of FBI director James Comey \u2013 supposedly a particularly malevolent Deep State operator \u2013 was \u201cmaybe\u201d the biggest mistake \u201cin modern political history\u201d.\n\nThis is not a new claim from Bannon, who told Wolff he told the president firing Comey would make the investigation of Russian election interference and links between Trump and Moscow \u201cthe biggest story in the world\u201d.\n\nBannon has reportedly asserted the Deep State is false before. In Wolff\u2019s follow-up book, Siege: Trump Under Fire, Bannon describes advice he gave to a ghost writer working on Trump\u2019s Enemies: How the Deep State is Undermining the Presidency, a book by Trump allies Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie.\n\nAccording to Wolff, Bannon said: \u201cYou do realise that none of this is true.\u201d", "description": "The former White House strategist, and a leading voice of the alt-right, was once key in the propagation of the conspiracy theorySteve Bannon, the former White House strategist, has claimed that the \u201cdeep state conspiracy theory is for nutcases\u201d.
