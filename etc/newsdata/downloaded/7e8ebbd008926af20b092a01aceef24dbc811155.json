Unfortunately, Warriors head coach Steve Kerr has snuffed most of that out. In an interview with Logan Murdock of NBC Sports Bay Area, Kerr said \"it's unlikely that he's going to play this year.\u201d\n\nWhile the All-Star break in February had been given as a target for Thompson\u2019s return (and Thompson\u2019s father Mychal had suggested mid-March as a possible date), that seems shockingly optimistic given the 11-12 month recovery time that\u2019s common for NBA players returning from an ACL tear. Returning in February would give Thompson just seven months to recover from his July surgery. Players like Zach LaVine and Jabari Parker needed nearly a year to fully recover.\n\nKerr saying it\u2019s \u201cunlikely\u201d that Thompson will play this season does leave room for him to beat the recovery odds, but Kerr isn\u2019t betting on it. He also essentially ruled out an April return for Thompson, which would have him playing his first games of the season right before or during the playoffs.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nStory continues\n\n\"You have to look at it realistically. I had an ACL [tear] in college, and I missed a whole season. Generally, an ACL for a basketball player is a full-year recovery, and if it's a full year for Klay, that puts them out for the season. \u201cWe've kind of left the door open in case the rehab goes perfectly and the doctors say he can go. But the reality is, on April 1, that\u2019s the nine-month mark. ... April versus nine months post-op for an ACL. \"We have to prepare our young guys to fill that role behind him, and when he gets back, whenever that is, hopefully these young guys now are developed and in the rotation and ready to really be contributors on a playoff team and we can get better.\"\n\nAfter tearing his ACL in June and having surgery in July, it's unlikely that Klay Thompson will suit up for the Warriors this season. (Lachlan Cunningham/Getty Images)\n\nIt already seems like Kerr is planning for Thompson to return during the 2020-2021 NBA season, which makes nobody happy \u2014 least of all Thompson. Kerr told NBC Sports that Thompson has been around the team more lately, but he\u2019s missing basketball something fierce.\n\n\"He's bored. I mean, Klay loves basketball, he loves to play, so he's at the point in his rehab, three-plus months in, where his knee feels pretty good. He's not in pain. He can get out there and shoot around, but he's got to let it heal, and he can't run, he can't cut. So we'll see him in the weight room, in the training room, getting his work in. \u201cBut I feel bad for him. You never feel part of it unless you're actually playing and with the guys, and he misses that.\"\n\nThompson\u2019s dad Mychal, himself a former NBA player, gave his son some advice for getting through what\u2019s likely to be one of the toughest seasons of his career. Via NBC Sports:\n\n\"It's tough. I told him it's gonna be tough. He's an ultimate competitor. He wants to play. He has so much fun playing for the Warriors and being around the game that he loves. \"I told him it's gonna be a tough mental grind. You got to keep yourself busy \u2014 be around the team, get on the air sometimes with [Bob] Fitzgerald and Kelenna [Azubuike]. Call a game sometimes, they'll be happy to have you call the game. \"Be on the bench and help coach, try to come up with some other business interests. That's what you have to do. You have to keep yourself mentally busy otherwise you'll go crazy because you miss it so much.\"\n\nKerr walks back comments: \u2018We\u2019ll leave the door open\u2019\n\nKerr clarified his comments on Tuesday afternoon, insisting that he wasn\u2019t making an announcement of any kind when he said it was \u201cunlikely\u201d that Thompson would return this season.\n\nIn his mind, he was just being realistic.\n\n\u201cMy comment was very matter of fact. It\u2019s just ACL\u2019s, generally. they take 9-12 months,\u201d Kerr said, via ESPN. \u201cSo nine months take us right to the end of the season. So I wasn\u2019t announcing anything, he\u2019s doing great in his rehab.\u201d\n\nDepending on how his recovery goes, Kerr said there is still a possibility that Kerr sees the floor this season after all.\n\nHowever his initial comments, Kerr said, simply weren\u2019t meant to be taken as fact.\n\n\u201cI probably opened up a can of worms yesterday with that comment ... but it\u2019s really not news,\u201d Kerr said, via ESPN. \u201cIt\u2019s more reality. We\u2019ll leave the door open and we\u2019ll see what happens at the end of the year, but Klay\u2019s doing great.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "After having surgery to repair his torn ACL in July, it's unlikely that Klay Thompson will take the court for the Warriors this season.", "authors": ["Liz Roscher"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5oVhdqnUypG6bdNrB1Nhmw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/otOVyKKnKssYg93aX23ZJg--~B/aD0xNTY0O3c9MjM0NztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/32b7ca50-f4e3-11e9-bdde-2a14e96c0c5e", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
