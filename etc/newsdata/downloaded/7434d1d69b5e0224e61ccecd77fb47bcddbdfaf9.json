The Dream Chaser has yet to see space, but once it\u2019s operational, it will help ferry cargo and science experiments to the astronauts on board the International Space Station between 2021 and 2024.\n\nThe Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC) is one of three companies tasked by NASA to periodically launch to the ISS to make sure the station is fully stocked with supplies. The cargo missions are all part of NASA\u2019s Commercial Resupply Services Program, one of a few initiatives at the space agency that\u2019s meant to offload space transportation to the private aerospace industry. The other two companies in the program, SpaceX and Northrop Grumman, have already been launching cargo to the station since 2012, thanks to an initial round of contracts. But NASA awarded a second round of contracts in 2016, adding SNC to the supplier pool.\n\nIn development since 2004, the Dream Chaser looks a lot like a miniature Space Shuttle. The plan is for the spaceplane to fly into orbit vertically on top of a rocket and then meet up with the ISS. The astronauts on board the station will then use the robotic arm to grab hold of the spaceplane and place it on an available docking port. Once all of the cargo it\u2019s carrying has been offloaded and the mission is complete, the Dream Chaser will separate from the ISS and then reenter the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Unlike other space capsules that use parachutes to land, the Dream Chaser will land akin to an airplane, gliding down horizontally onto a runway.\n\n\u201cIt truly provides a very unique capability, different than anything else available in the world today and in the foreseeable future,\u201d SNC CEO Fatih Ozmen said during a press conference announcing the selection of Vulcan.\n\nOriginally, the company envisioned launching the Dream Chaser on ULA\u2019s Atlas V to carry astronauts to and from the ISS for NASA, and the team even received initial development funding from the space agency to work on a crewed vehicle. But NASA ultimately awarded contracts to SpaceX and Boeing to send humans to the space station. So SNC decided to rework the Dream Chaser to just carry cargo, and the company is now tasked with launching a total of 12,000 pounds of cargo on a minimum of six supply missions for NASA. The company maintains there is still the possibility of flying people on Dream Chaser in the future.\n\nIn fact, SNC maintains that the cargo Dream Chaser could carry people if absolutely necessary since it has some life support and temperature control systems. \u201cYou could actually, in an emergency even today, bring people down If you had to,\u201d John Curry, the program director for Dream Chaser\u2019s cargo missions, said at the press conference. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that NASA has asked us to do that. I\u2019m just saying that the capability is there. So the bridge to a crewed vehicle is not that far.\u201d\n\nSNC has other plans for its Dream Chaser, including launching international payloads to space for the United Nations as early as 2021. But there\u2019s still quite a lot of work to be done before Dream Chaser is shooting upward on a Vulcan rocket. For one thing, the Vulcan has to start flying first. ULA has already started bending metal for the rocket, which is derived from the company\u2019s already operational Atlas V rocket. But the first flight isn\u2019t supposed to take place until 2021. The Dream Chaser will fly on the second flight of the Vulcan.\n\n\u201cI have been a fan and a supporter and a cheerleader of this amazing vehicle from the first moment I saw it,\u201d ULA CEO Tory Bruno said during today\u2019s press conference. \u201cAnd so to be able to make Vulcan\u2019s sort of commercial debut with this block of missions underneath a Dream Chaser is just truly exciting.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, SNC has been doing tests on the Dream Chaser, and it performed the vehicle\u2019s second free flight in 2017, demonstrating that the spaceplane can land successfully from a super high altitude. The flight was much more successful than the first test in 2013 when the vehicle\u2019s landing gear failed and caused the spaceplane to skid off the runway on touchdown. More tests are scheduled for the years ahead as SNC gets ready for the Dream Chaser\u2019s first launch.\n\nUpdate August 14th, 3:15PM ET: This article was updated to include additional information from an SNC press conference.", "description": "Private space company Sierra Nevada Corporation announced that its mini-spaceplane, the Dream Chaser, will launch into orbit on top of the United Launch Alliance\u2019s future Vulcan Centaur rocket.
