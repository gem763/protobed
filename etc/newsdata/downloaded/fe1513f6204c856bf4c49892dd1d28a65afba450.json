Maps of fires detected by satellites were next to emerge, showing hot spots not only on the South American continent but across the globe. French President Emmanuel Macron referenced these maps in tweets shortly after the Group of Seven summit this week, saying that \u201cThe forest is also burning in sub-Saharan Africa.\u201d Macron said that he is considering a similar plan of action for Africa, as was just announced for the Amazon.\n\n[What you need to know about the Amazon rainforest fires]\n\nBut not all fires on the planet are the same. There are distinct burning seasons in many parts of the world, driven by the rainy and dry periods, agricultural practices and the spread of human population.\n\nFires detected by satellite, 2000 to 2019 Jan.\u2014Mar.

According to Lauren Williams, the senior manager for Central and West African forests at the World Resources Institute, \u201cFires are not uncommon in most of the Congo\u2019s forested ecosystems.\" She added: \u201cFire is both a natural part of these ecosystems and an important land management tool in Congo that is used to clear land for agriculture, cropland management, and road clearing. Fires such as these are more common during the dry season, which lasts from roughly May to September.\u201d\n\nFires detected by satellite, 2018 Jan.\u2014Mar. April\u2014June July\u2014Sept.

(NASA/AP)\n\nBut fires in South America are different. In Africa, fires are used to clear grasslands and savanna. The ecosystem there has developed to embrace and depend on fires. Many of the fires on the South American continent are on the edge of the Amazon rainforest and are burning virgin forest.\n\nFires detected by satellite, 2018 Jan.\u2014Mar.

While it is not clear whether this trend will continue to increase beyond normal levels, the fire season in the Amazon (south of the equator) has just begun and bears monitoring.\n\nAbout this story\n\nFire data is from NASA\u2019s Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS).
