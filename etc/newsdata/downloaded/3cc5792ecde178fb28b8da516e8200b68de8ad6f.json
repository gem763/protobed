However, if measles is introduced into an under-vaccinated community, it can spread quickly and it can be difficult to control, officials said.\n\nThe New York State Department of Health yesterday declared the outbreak over. The last recent reported rash onset was July 15 in New York City, and Aug. 19 in the rest of New York state. However, the CDC said \u201ccontinued vigilance is important to ensure that elimination is sustained.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. officially \u201celiminated\u201d measles in 2000, but the outbreaks threatened that status. A country is considered to have eliminated measles after an absence of continuous spread of the disease for more than a year.\n\n\u201cCDC encourages Americans to embrace vaccination with confidence for themselves and their families. We want to emphasize that vaccines are safe. They remain the most powerful tool to preserve health and to save lives,\u201d CDC Director Robert Redfield said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe prevalence of measles is a global challenge, and the best way to stop this and other vaccine preventable diseases from gaining a foothold in the U.S. is to accept vaccines,\u201d he said.\n\nThe U.S. is not alone; there\u2019s a global trend of declining vaccination rates, which officials said may have exacerbated the problem in this country.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) in April reported that there has been a 300 percent increase in the number of measles cases worldwide compared with the first three months of 2018.\n\nWHO also for the first time declared vaccine hesitancy as a top 10 threat to global health.", "description": "The U.S. has narrowly maintained its measles elimination status, despite one of the worst outbreaks of the disease in over 20 years, federal health officials said Friday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/measlesvaccine_042215getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
