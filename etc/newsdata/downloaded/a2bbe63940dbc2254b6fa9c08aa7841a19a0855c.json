Here 3,392 households with a population of 37,670 residents have been left stranded after the Nqweba dam, which supplies water to all areas of the town and surrounds, dried up.\n\nAt the beginning of October their only source of water was from 28 boreholes until humanitarian organisation Gift of The Givers trucked in teams to the Dr Beyers Naud\u00e9 municipality to bring in relief.\n\nGift of the Givers committed to three superlinks laden with water, three water tankers, a drilling machine, and has sent a renowned hydrologist Gideon Groenewald to the area, then drilled five boreholes that have yielded 102,000 litres per day, collectively, reports News24.\n\nWater shortages are not uncommon in South Africa; it is the 30th driest country in the world, and current severe water shortages have been caused by a combination of years of bad management and drought.\n\nAccording to the latest National Biodiversity Assessment 2018, by the South African National Biodiversity Institute, average temperature increases of more than 1\u00b0C have been observed in the past 50 years.
