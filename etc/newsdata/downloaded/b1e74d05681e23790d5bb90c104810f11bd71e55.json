My grandparents followed, and my father was born in Texas soon after,\u201d she began, going on to say that she was lucky enough to be born as a U.S. citizen as a result of their \u201cbravery and sacrifice.\u201d\n\nShe said members of her family had toiled over four decades to gain U.S. citizenship \u2015 and as a result, the issue was one that weighed on her mind daily.\n\n\u201cI feel afraid for those in similar situations. I feel afraid for my country,\u201d she wrote.\n\nAcknowledging that she is no expert on the issue, Gomez called on others to push through their fear of criticism, as she\u2019s done, and tackle the crisis by getting involved and educated on the issue facing millions across the country.\n\nGomez is the executive producer of a new documentary series, \u201cLiving Undocumented,\u201d which chronicles the lives of eight immigrant families living in the U.S. and facing deportation.\n\nShe hoped the series would, in shining a light on these deeply personal stories, remind people that the issue goes beyond \u201cpolitics and headlines.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to listen to the people whose lives are being directly affected by immigration policies,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe star, who has previously been open about struggles with mental health and facing negative comments on social media, said she feared criticism when she signed on to produce the show, but found motivation to confront it head-on.\n\n\u201cThe truth is, the worst criticism I can imagine is still nothing compared to what undocumented immigrants face every day,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cFear didn\u2019t stop my aunt from getting into the back of that truck. And for that, I will always be grateful.\u201d\n\n\u201cLiving Undocumented\u201d will launch globally on Netflix on Wednesday.", "description": "The Mexican-American star discussed America's immigration crisis, telling the story of her own family's journey as undocumented immigrants.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d942c342100005100515d0d.jpeg?cache=rhzout2uhd&ops=1778_1000"}
