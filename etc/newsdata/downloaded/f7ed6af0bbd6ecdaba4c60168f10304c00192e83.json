Everyone is just smiling and talking about baseball like none of this happened.\u201d\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe Astros have turned Roberto Osuna's alleged domestic abuse into one of the World Series' dominant stories. (Adam Glanzman/Getty Images)\n\nThe story is well-known across baseball by now. The Astros traded for closer Roberto Osuna in 2018 despite a suspension for an alleged domestic abuse incident. Osuna remained effective but allowed a game-tying homer in Game 6 of the ALCS against the Yankees.\n\nA victorious Taubman, the now-former assistant general manager of the Astros, taunted a group of female reporters \u2014 one of whom was wearing a domestic violence ribbon and has tweeted frequently about the matter \u2014 by repeatedly shouting \u201cI\u2019m so f---ing glad we got Osuna.\u201d\n\nThe story was bad enough, but the Astros made it so, so much worse by attempting to completely rebuke the initial account of the incident from Sports Illustrated\u2019s Stephanie Apstein, calling her now-substantiated story \u201cmisleading,\u201d \u201ccompletely irresponsible\u201d and an \u201cattempt to fabricate a story where one does not exist.\u201d Several reporters who witnessed the incident, including Yahoo Sports\u2019 Hannah Keyser, immediately contradicted the Astros\u2019 statement.\n\nStory continues\n\nTaubman was fired days later, with the Astros admitting they were wrong in questioning Apstein\u2019s story. Waldman felt the attempted cover-up was worse than the actual incident:\n\n\u201cListen, they did what they did [signing him], and Osuna did what he did,\u201d Waldman said of the domestic violence case that wasn\u2019t prosecuted when the victim declined to return from her home in Mexico to testify. \u201cHe\u2019ll pay for it in a way. He\u2019s never going to see that child or whatever. The [Astros] did what they did. I understand it. I don\u2019t like it, but I understand it. The problem is lying, trying to cover up something that is so hideous anyway, then blaming it on a young woman and trying to ruin her career. That\u2019s the part I can\u2019t look her in the face. \u201cWhat they did was worse than Taubman yelling at her, which is vile enough. They tried to ruin a young woman\u2019s career. How do you come back from that?\u201d\n\nObviously, Waldman\u2019s own organization isn\u2019t clean when it comes to domestic abuse due to Aroldis Chapman\u2019s 30-game domestic violence suspension in 2016. However, the Yankees have never done anything like what the Astros have bumbled their way into.\n\nWaldman has definitely seen her share of Brandon Taubmans in her decades of work as a baseball reporter and broadcaster. You can\u2019t blame her for being fed up with a team that has failed at nearly every opportunity to show accountability for an incident that has become one of the stories of the World Series.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Waldman probably isn't alone among baseball fans fed up with the Astros' handling of an incident involving a now-fired executive and closer Roberto Osuna.", "authors": ["Jack Baer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/M0FWCdb45vodLSxkq6lnyA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTQuNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/lXi_t6dRmoYhlWL4r94LGA--~B/aD0xMzg1O3c9MjA3NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/c8ee54e0-f852-11e9-8f97-6a769c98d056", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
