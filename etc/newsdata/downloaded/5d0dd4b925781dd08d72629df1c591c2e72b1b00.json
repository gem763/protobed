(\u201cAgraFlora\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (CSE: AGRA) (Frankfurt: PU31) (OTCPK: AGFAF), a growth oriented and diversified international cannabis company, is pleased to provide guidance related to the cross functional integration of its patented, pharmaceutical grade cannabinoid dispensing technology, regional cannabis trademark portfolio and CBD performance product suite into the Company\u2019s 17,500 North American points of distribution.\n\n\n\nAgraFlora\u2019s patented, pharmaceutical grade and hermetically sealed dispensing technology (the \u201cPharma-Grade Bottle Cap\u201d) is designed to preserve volatile ingredients such as cannabinoids (CBD/THC/CBDA/CBG), antibiotics, probiotics, vitamins, and minerals. The Company's intuitive and user-friendly Pharma-Grade Bottle Cap enables the fresh release of premium and blended medicinal ingredients and/or cannabinoids into an assortment of bottled liquids, resulting in superior shelf stability and increased efficacy when compared with premixed beverages, which are susceptible to rapid nutrient deterioration.\n\nRefined over five years, with research and development expenditures of US$30 million, the Company will leverage its exclusive rights to a marquee Pharma-Grade Bottle Cap to revolutionize North America\u2019s emerging cannabinoid-infused beverage marketplace.\n\nAlongside its exclusive CBD sports partner and transcontinental professional sports team, the Toronto Wolfpack RLFC (the \u201cWolfpack\u201d or \u201cTWP\u201d), AgraFlora is preparing for the North American launch of a GMP-certified, CBD-infused performance SKU, Rugby Strength. A replenishing topical cream formulated for high-performance athletes, Rugby Strength has been scientifically developed to achieve the best results in natural wellness through the use of the highest standard of CBD.\n\nAdditionally, the Company has aggregated a diversified portfolio of 57 distinct, high-value cannabis product and service trademarks (the \u201cCannabis Trademarks\u201d), which it intends to deploy within its edibles, topical and beverage product offering. Included in the portfolio are a series of recognizable, trademarks for exclusive use within the cannabis industry including: regional airport call signs, telephonic area codes and other such recognizable regional identifiers for every Canadian municipality with over 100,000 residents.\n\nAgraFlora is of the opinion that its Cannabis Trademarks exhibit unrivalled branding potential for the cannabis space. It is the Company\u2019s thesis that consumers will gravitate towards premium SKUs, which are branded with familiar labels and markers while navigating their maiden purchase of cannabis products- thus amplifying a sense of allegiance to their respective region.\n\nThe number of registered marks and the robust coverage of the registration with the Registrar of Trademarks in Canada allows AgraFlora to immediately utilize these marks across its diversified holdings and enhance its marketing and distribution efforts in Canada and other international jurisdictions.\n\nThe Company\u2019s patented Pharma-Grade Bottle Cap and CBD performance product suite provides AgraFlora with a foundational platform to enter the sports nutrition and hydration segment, and lays the groundwork for the adoption of CBD/THC/CBDA/CBG in future beverage product offerings in accordance with upcoming regulatory guidance.\n\nAgraFlora\u2019s pursuit of defendable cannabinoid beverage technologies, as well as CBD-infused performance products is further validated by recent acquisitions by industry peers, including Canopy Growth Corp.\u2019s all-cash transaction to purchase a majority stake in BioSteel Sports Nutrition Inc., a producer of sports nutrition products (see Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1.\n\nAgraFlora\u2019s Pharma-Grade Bottle Cap BioSteel Sport Nutrition Inc. 1 17,500 North American Points of Distribution 10,000 North American Points of Distribution 3 Medical Patents, 7 Design Patents, 10 Utility Patents 1 Design Patent Hermetically sealed formulations Pre-mixed formulation susceptible to degradation Medical and recreational usage Recreational usage Integrated with 57 unique, high-value regional trademarks Branded under the BioSteel corporate umbrella Medical grade delivery technology ensuring consistent dosage of formulations Antiquated pre-mix technologies Permits liquid or powder inputs Solely powered inputs\n\nAgraFlora's Pharma-Grade Bottle Cap, when coupled with the Company\u2019s anticipated award of a cannabis research and development licence (the \u201cR&D License) at its 51,500 square foot Winnipeg Edibles Facility, permits immediate product development for a net-new suite of cannabinoid-infused beverages; thus preserving its first-mover advantage within the infused beverage arena.\n\nThe Company is also pleased to reiterate the following Pharma-Grade Bottle Cap related manufacturing guidance:\n\nSole Canadian manufacturer and distributor of its Pharma-Grade Bottle Cap, certified for health care and pharmaceutical applications;\n\nFinalized purchase order for 1.9 million twist and release dose cap units for mass production, further solidifying AgraFlora's position as a first mover within the cannabinoid-infused beverage vertical;\n\nRobust patent portfolio, including seven design patents, 10 utility patents, as well as certified as a pharma-grade medical device under three U.S. medical patents; and,\n\nExclusive care and control of a portfolio of established cannabinoid-infused product formulation recipes already featured in mature U.S. marketplaces.\n\nBrandon Boddy, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of AgraFlora stated: \u201cOur continued commitment to cross functional integration and knowledge sharing across our various subsidiaries further magnifies the accretive nature of our diverse operating business units.
