This is part of NATO\u2019s Black Sea security concept,\u201d Levan Bodzashvili, an independent political analyst, told Reuters.\n\nExperts and consortium members said Russia would not be happy if Anaklia was built.\n\n\u201cAnaklia will definitely compete with Novorossiisk port (in Russia) as it\u2019s an alternative gateway to the Central Asia,\u201d Akhvlediani told Reuters.\n\nRussia\u2019s partner China was also seen as a possible player and local media reported that China was trying to press Georgia to oust American developers, replacing them with Chinese state-owned companies in a move to seek better access for Chinese-made products in European markets.", "description": "The consortium behind one of the biggest projects in ex-Soviet Georgia, the construction of the major deep sea port Anaklia on the Black Sea coast, has accused the government of sabotage and put the project on hold, its director general said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Margarita Antidze", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
