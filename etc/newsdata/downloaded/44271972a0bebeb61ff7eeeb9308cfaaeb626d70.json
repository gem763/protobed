She began by mourning her late friend Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), who died in Baltimore Thursday morning from longstanding health issues.\n\nShe remembered her \"brother from Baltimore\" and a \"north star\" who \"spoke with moral clarity.\"\n\nThe speaker then offered the press an account of her and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's meeting with Trump. Pelosi said that \"Putin benefits\" from Trump's decision to pull U.S. troops from Syria. When the president pushed back and said he wanted to bring our troops home, she asked him a follow up question about our presence in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"Is Saudi Arabia home?\" she asked. \"Why are our troops going to Saudi Arabia?\"\n\nAccording to Pelosi, Trump said \"because Saudi Arabia is paying for it.\"\n\n\"It just didn't add up,\" Pelosi noted. \"It caused a meltdown on the part of the president because he was unhappy with those questions.\"\n\nIt was, she said, \"most unfortunate.\"\n\nIn Trump's perspective, however, Pelosi was the one who was \"unhinged.\"\n\nNancy Pelosi needs help fast! There is either something wrong with her \u201cupstairs,\u201d or she just plain doesn\u2019t like our great Country. She had a total meltdown in the White House today. It was very sad to watch. Pray for her, she is a very sick person! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 17, 2019\n\nPelosi was asked about the above photo and she explained, \u201cI think I was excusing myself from the room,\u201d or saying, \"all roads lead to Putin.\"\n\nDemocrats are proceeding on impeachment \u201csolemnly,\u201d Pelosi said. \"No one\" came to Congress wanting to impeach a president, but she suggested they are compelled to because \"the times have found us.\"\n\nShe is \u201cvery proud\u201d of the leadership House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff has shown during the impeachment inquiry.", "description": ".10/17/2019 21:04:06PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa", "Bronson Stocking", "Alex Nitzberg"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/269/ef5eb632-e868-4f93-b614-50ad162493a0.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
