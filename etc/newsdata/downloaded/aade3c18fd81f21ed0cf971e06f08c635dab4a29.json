At nearly every press conference, Kerr lapses into polemics about politics and in no uncertain terms, castigates anyone who disagrees with his political view. And the woke NBA thinks he is wonderful.\n\nA recent Guardian article, for instance, lauds Kerr for not sticking to sports. Indeed, as far as the paper was concerned, this hardcore leftist is the \u201cU.S. sport\u2019s voice of reason.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo topic seems off limits. No question is too dangerous,\u201d Les Carpenter glowingly wrote for the Guardian last year in praise of Kerr.\n\nKerr is \u201cfearless about social justice,\u201d he is \u201cpowerful\u201d in his speech, and he is \u201cbrave.\u201d\n\nThat is, until the NBA decided to prostrate itself before a mountain of Chinese money and apologize to China because a member of the league tweeted out support for the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong. Then, suddenly, the \u201cbrave\u201d Kerr is too confused about all these complicated issues in China \u2014 one of the biggest human rights abusers in the world.\n\nOn Monday, Kerr was asked what he thought about the NBA\u2019s groveling before the human rights-abusing communist country. Did Kerr have a comment? \u201cActually I don\u2019t,\u201d he surprisingly said.\n\n\u201cA lot of us don\u2019t know what to make of it,\u201d Kerr replied meekly:\n\nSteve Kerr has no comment on NBA\u2019s China issues. He comments on every Trump tweet and can\u2019t support democracy in China? What a complete and total coward. pic.twitter.com/Fr4FJIaOW0 \u2014 Clay Travis (@ClayTravis) October 8, 2019\n\nKerr continued when asked about China: \u201cIt\u2019s a really bizarre international story. A lot of us don\u2019t know what to make of it. It\u2019s something I\u2019m reading about like everybody is, but I\u2019m not gonna comment further than that.\u201d\n\nKerr went on, saying, \u201cWhat I\u2019ve found is that it\u2019s easy to speak on issues that I\u2019m passionate about and what I feel like I\u2019m well-versed on, and what I\u2019ve found that it makes the most sense to stick to topics that fall in that category. So, I try to keep my comments to those things and so it\u2019s not difficult. It\u2019s more I\u2019m trying to learn.\n\n\u201cMy brother-in-law is actually a Chinese history professor,\u201d Kerr concluded, \u201cand I emailed him today to tell me what I should be learning about all this and what\u2019s happening and so I\u2019m trying to learn like everybody else.\u201d\n\nIt appears that coach Kerr is more than ready to call Americans racists, homophobes, and haters, and to call for their destruction, but he is uncharacteristically \u201cuninformed\u201d about a country that beats gays, jails political and religious dissenters, murders minorities, and bans free speech for its citizens.\n\nSo brave.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.", "description": "Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr is always quick to excoriate President Trump, but when it comes to the NBA's appeasement of human", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Getty-Images-10-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
