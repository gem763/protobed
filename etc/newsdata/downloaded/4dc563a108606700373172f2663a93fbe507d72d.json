He also appeared to support the president's contention that Alabama was in the storm's potential path at one point although Trump's comments came after the threat had effectively disappeared.\n\n\u201cHaving a category 5 sitting 150 miles off the coast is incredibly intimidating situation for forecasters to deal with,\u201d Jacobs said. \u201cAt one point, Alabama was in the mix, as was the rest of the southeast.\u201d\n\nIn an unsigned statement issued late last week, NOAA said the NWS Birmingham office, which originally contradicted the president's claim on Sunday, before Dorian came near the Florida coast, that Alabama would be affected, was wrong to speak \"in absolute terms\" when it tweeted: \"Alabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian.\"\n\nThe NOAA statement on Friday ignited a firestorm of criticism from career staffers at the National Weather Service, who in recent days have been speaking out in support of their colleagues at the NWS Birmingham office.\n\nFormer NOAA general counsel in the Clinton Administration Monica Medina tweeted, \u201cAs a former @NOAA leader I can say two things with certainty. No NOAA Administrator I worked for would have done this. And I would have quit if I had been directed to agree to let this BS go out.\u201d\n\nAs a former @NOAA leader I can say two things with certainty.

These employees work under extremely arduous circumstances.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey did what any office would do to protect the public,\u201d said Louis Uccellini, director of the National Weather Service on Monday. \"They did that with one thing in mind: public safety.\u201d\n\nMembers of Congress were being briefed Tuesday on the threat to fire NOAA staff, according to people familiar with the ongoing conversations.\n\n\u201cI am extremely disturbed by the directive that NOAA leadership sent on September 6, which threatens the integrity and public trust of weather forecasts at the peak of Hurricane season,\u201d said Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-Texas, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. \u201cThe Committee will pursue this issue and we expect full cooperation from the Department of Commerce in our efforts.\"", "description": "Reported firing threats, along with an unsigned statement on Hurricane Dorian backing President Trump, are now \u201cmatters under review by NOAA's inspector general.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/president-trump-dorian-map-ap-jef-190904_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
