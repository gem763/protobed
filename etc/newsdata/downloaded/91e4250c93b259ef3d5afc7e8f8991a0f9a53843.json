The price also includes the government subsidies available on the electric car.\n\nThe new Tigor EV Electric claims a range of 213 km (ARAI approved) as opposed to the 120 km claimed by its earlier iteration sold to the government and fleet operators.

In addition, the fastest charging time claimed for the battery is 90 minutes from 0 to 80 percent. Safety features on the Tigor EV will include dual airbags (XE+ variant with Driver Airbag only) and an anti-lock braking system as standard.

A significant one is the drop in GST on electric vehicles from 12 percent to 5 percent. In addition, there are several incentives under the FAME-II scheme of the government.\n\nDon't Miss 1.6 K SHARES 552 SHARES 1 K SHARES\n\nTata Tigor EV (Image: Sarthak Dogra/ IndiaTimes)\n\nTata Motors will be selling the Tigor EV in 30 cities across India and chances are, the location of purchase will also impact the final price of the Tigor EV, considering the local incentives offered by the state governments on electric vehicles.\n\nTata Motors earlier confirmed its plans to roll out 5 new electric vehicles in the country by next year.
