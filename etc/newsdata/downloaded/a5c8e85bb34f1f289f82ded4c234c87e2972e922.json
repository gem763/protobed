The first is by taking advantage of E-Verify\u2019s biggest weakness: It checks the identification papers, not the worker. Thus, an undocumented immigrant worker can pass an E-Verify check if he hands somebody else\u2019s identification to his employer. According to an audit for the federal government conducted by Westat, about 54 percent of undocumented immigrant workers are approved to work by E-Verify for this very reason.\n\nThe workers sometimes steal IDs, but many also borrow them from friends or family members. The story of a young undocumented immigrant named \u201cManuel\u201d explains how so-called identity loans work. Manuel needed identification to work in the unionized construction industry in San Francisco. He contacted an uncle in Mexico who had obtained a Social Security number in the early 1970s but then returned to Mexico permanently. The uncle let Manuel use his SSN and forge a new green card with his uncle\u2019s name. Since there is no victim of this kind of fraud, identity loans are extremely difficult to stop.\n\nBut workers aren\u2019t the only ones who have figured out how to fool E-Verify \u2014 many businesses are also adept at doing so. The easiest way is to just not use E-Verify.", "description": "", "authors": ["Alex Nowrasteh", "Politico.Com News Agenda"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
