The office told lawmakers that the meeting is to discuss documents that were obtained from the State Department's office of the legal adviser.\n\nThe bipartisan meetings will include the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and House Foreign Affairs Committee, along with panels on homeland security, oversight and intelligence.\n\nThe secretary confirmed his participation in the call one day after reports first emerged that he took part. In response to that news, key House Democrats issued a statement saying Pompeo \"is now a fact witness in the House impeachment inquiry.\"\n\nCongressional Democrats and Pompeo have been trading accusations that each side is attempting to intimidate or bully witnesses in the impeachment inquiry. On Tuesday, House Democrats postponed what had been expected to be the first of a series of depositions after Pompeo raised objections.\n\nAs NPR's Franco Ordo\u00f1ez reported, that first deposition was expected to occur today, in a closed session between former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch and the House Intelligence Committee. That session is now postponed until Oct. 11.\n\nIn addition to discussing Trump's Ukraine phone call on Wednesday, Pompeo again criticized the way in which the House impeachment inquiry is being handled \u2014 especially Democrats' approach to seeking testimony from State Department officials.\n\nPompeo said potential witnesses were contacted directly by investigators and told they could not be accompanied by State Dept. attorneys during their testimony \u2014 a requirement that he said raises separation of powers concerns for the Trump administration.\n\n\"They contacted State Department employees directly \u2014 told them not to contact legal counsel at the State Department,\" Pompeo said in Italy.\n\nAnother closed deposition is scheduled for Thursday, when lawmakers will question another former envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker.\n\nNPR's Michele Kelemen contributed to this report.", "description": "The secretary of state confirms he was on the phone along with President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for the July 25 phone call that sparked an impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Bill Chappell"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/02/gettyimages-1173069916_wide-13b940dfb46d9ec8b52d445d6cfe76320c7e7864.jpg?s=1400"}
