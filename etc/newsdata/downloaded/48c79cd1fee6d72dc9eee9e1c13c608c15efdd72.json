Sputnik/Alexei Nikolsky/Kremlin via REUTERS\n\nAs the world waits to see what happens next and Washington and U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres suggested the U.N. Security Council has a role to play following Saturday\u2019s attacks, some attention has turned to when and how it could.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m confident that in New York we\u2019ll talk a lot about this and that the Saudis will too,\u201d U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday when asked if the United States would take the issue to the 15-member body, which is charged with maintaining global peace and security.\n\nHe added on Thursday: \u201cWe\u2019d like a peaceful resolution, indeed I think we\u2019ve demonstrated that.\u201d\n\nThe United States and its ally Saudi Arabia blame Iran for the attack on the world\u2019s biggest crude oil processing facility and have said they will present evidence to back that up. Yemen\u2019s Iran-aligned Houthi group, which has been fighting a Saudi-led military coalition since 2015, has claimed responsibility.\n\nSaudi U.N. Ambassador Abdallah Al-Mouallimi wrote to the Council on Wednesday to formally report the attack and to invite U.N. experts to \u201cparticipate in the investigations,\u201d according to a letter seen by Reuters.\n\n\u201cAll preliminary signs and indicators reveal that this attack did not emanate from Yemeni lands as claimed by the terrorist Houthi militia, and that the weapons used were Iranian made,\u201d wrote Al-Mouallimi.\n\n\u2018BE REALISTIC\u2019\n\nU.N. experts who monitor and report to the Security Council on the implementation of U.N. sanctions on Iran and Yemen travelled to Riyadh and Guterres warned on Wednesday that a major confrontation in the Gulf would have \u201cdevastating consequences\u201d for the region and globally.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there is a more serious threat to peace and security in the world today than what\u2019s happening in the Gulf. This clearly an area where I am absolutely sure the Security Council has a key role to play,\u201d Guterres told reporters.\n\nAsked whether he thought the Security Council should discuss the issue, Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia, council president for September, said: \u201cThat depends on how things will develop.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether it might come up next week or not,\u201d he said. \u201cI do not exclude it.\u201d\n\nAn already-tense relationship between Iran and the United States has worsened over the past year since Trump withdrew from a nuclear pact between Iran and world powers, saying it did not go far enough, and reimposed sanctions on Iran as part of a \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d policy.\n\nIn response, Iran has gradually reduced its commitments to limit uranium enrichment activity under the pact and plans further breaches if European parties fail to keep their promises to shield Iran\u2019s economy from U.S. sanctions.\n\n\u201cThis maximum pressure policy was designed to change Iran\u2019s behaviour. Just the opposite is happening and Iran will not get down on its knees and implore the U.S. for a better deal. So the choice now is be realistic and get back to a reasonable approach,\u201d said a senior European diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nA senior Trump administration official, however, suggested that the tensions were manageable.\n\n\u201cIran has a long history of testing its strength. But they never climb too high up the escalation ladder. At a certain point, when the world says enough, they come back down,\u201d the official told reporters on condition of anonymity.\n\nAn Iranian official close to the office of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Iranian establishment was united in resisting U.S. pressure.\n\n\u201cEye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. They think by sanctions they can back us into a corner. Wishful thinking. As long as they pressure Iran, we will push back. Iran is a big country with lots of resources and can survive without oil money,\u201d said the official.\n\n\u2018GREATEST SENSATION\u2019\n\nSome diplomats and analysts said it was difficult to see an immediate path to talks between the United States and Iran.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron spent the past couple of months trying to defuse tensions with the idea of convincing Iran to return to fully implementing the accord and open a broader negotiation in return for $15 billion dollars credit for the Tehran government.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that there are tensions. The fact is that there is a risk of escalation that justifies our diplomatic action. That said, one cannot force people who do not want to negotiate to negotiate,\u201d an aide to Macron told reporters in Paris on Thursday.\n\nA second senior European diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that many in Iran would want to meet with the United States but \u201cit is very hard for them to do without it looking like they are giving in to America\u201d and they would want to have some sense of what would follow.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump speaks to reporters as he departs for Baltimore, Maryland from the South Lawn of the White House in Washington U.S., September 12, 2019. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\n\nLast week Trump flirted with the idea of meeting Rouhani during the U.N. General Assembly and even left open the possibility that the United States could ease sanctions on Iran.\n\nTrump has since backed away from those ideas while Khamenei has said Iran would never hold such one-on-one talks but could engage in multilateral discussions if Washington returns to the 2015 pact.\n\nBut Russia\u2019s Nebenzia, while acknowledging the chances of a meeting were very slim, said with a smile: \u201cMaybe that will be the greatest sensation of the forthcoming high-level week, I don\u2019t know.\u201d", "description": "The chances of a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani while they are both in New York next week for the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations have dwindled since an attack on Saudi oil facilities.", "authors": ["Michelle Nichols", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431749422&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I1ZS", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
