He has continued to do so since becoming president, despite claims it is racist.\n\nOn Wednesday, the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI), which describes itself as the oldest and largest indigenous rights organisation in the US, formally criticised Mr Trump, saying his actions were part of a long tradition of insults endured by Native Americans and other indigenous groups.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

I hit her really hard, and it looked like she was down and out, but that was too long ago,\u201d Mr Trump said. \u201cI should have waited. But don\u2019t worry, we will revive it. It can be revived. It will be revived. And it can be revived very easily, and very quickly, and we\u2019re gonna have some fun in the state of New Hampshire.\u201d\n\nIn his statement, Mr Allis said the president\u2019s comments \u201cdismiss our rightful place as this country\u2019s First Americans, and ignore the immense contributions that tribal nations and peoples have made and continue to make\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cSilence in the face of such divisive behaviour and degrading rhetoric is complicity. We call on all Americans to denounce the continued use of such terms and the sentiments they express.\u201d", "description": "Donald Trump\u2019s repeated use of the name \u201cPocahontas\u201d as part of an attack on Democrat Elizabeth Warren has been condemned as \u201can insult for political gain\u201d, by the country\u2019s largest indigenous rights groups.", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/28/16/pocahontas-condemn.jpg"}
