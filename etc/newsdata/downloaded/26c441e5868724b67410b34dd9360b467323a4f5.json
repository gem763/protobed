If they dominate possession, they struggle to create. The penalty, coming minutes before the interval, was their first shot on target of the night. It would be their only shot on target of the night. Having failed to register one against AZ Alkmaar earlier this month, they can count themselves lucky to go top of Group L.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Brandon Williams made his second senior start, having impressed away to AZ Alkmaar earlier this month. He put in another eye-catching display.\n\nGiven freedom to operate alone down the left flank, it was his drive that won the penalty at the end of the first half. It was the type of direct, fearless play that Solskjaer demands, the type of conviction that United\u2019s attack is often lacking.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

This was their fifth of the season already. Since Solskjaer\u2019s first game in charge last December, they have won 14 and scored 11 - more than any other top-flight side in all competitions.\n\nAsk the United manager himself and he will tell you they should have been awarded several more. It all begs the question whether United have a particular knack of winning spot-kicks, or whether it is just a freak trend that that will even out over time? One thing is for certain: United\u2019s meagre attack means they need all the penalties they can get.\n\nRusty Martial comes back too quickly\n\nIt may seem harsh to single out the player who scored the decisive penalty, but it was otherwise a forgettable night for Martial. On his first start since August, having recovered from a hamstring injury, the 23-year-old cut an isolated figure for long periods, struggling to find space between Partizan\u2019s disciplined defence or rhythm in United\u2019s disjointed attack.\n\nDid he come back too quickly? Perhaps. He was only fit enough for a six-minute cameo on Sunday. But such is the lack of depth in United\u2019s attack, and such is the importance of keeping Marcus Rashford fresh through rotation, Martial had to start. He was replaced after an hour having made little impact, the penalty aside.\n\nA better Belgrade beats United\n\nTo get an idea of just how narrow a victory this was for United, take a look at the final shot count. Whereas Solskjaer\u2019s side managed five attempts at Vladimir Stojkovic\u2019s goal on and off target combined, Partizan made 15 efforts in total. This was not an easy night at the office for Sergio Romero.\n\nThankfully, Savo Milosevic\u2019s side looked like the fifth-best team in Serbia and that is precisely where they find themselves after 11 games domestically. Only two of their 15 attempts were on target, while much of their counter-attacking was slow and cumbersome. A better team would have punished United.", "description": "Three points, new system, same problems Ole Gunnar Solskjaer kept faith in the five-at-the-back formation which earned an unexpected draw against Liverpool at the weekend.
