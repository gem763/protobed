Matt Bevins said in a statement.\n\nBlackjewel filed for bankruptcy July 1, without filing the mandatory 60-day advance warning and without posting a bond - which is a requirement by Kentucky law - to cover payroll.\n\nA group of former Blackjewel coal miners block a train carrying coal on August 22, in protest at not getting paid after the company went bankrupt\n\nBehind a locked gate, train cars loaded with coal sit on the tracks at a Blackjewel mining operation in August 2019. Following a sudden bankruptcy, former Blackjewel workers staged the 'sit-in' to get owned salary\n\nUnemployed Blackjewel coal miners create a blockage along the tracks leading to their old mine in Cumberland, Kentucky on August 23\n\nTrain cars loaded with coal sit on the tracks at a Blackjewel mining operation on August 22, in Cumberland, Kentucky as unemployed miners fought for their lost wages. They received a $5.1million settlement Friday\n\nAs a result the miners' final paychecks bounced, leaving many out of pocket.\n\nThat led to the workers blocking the train, frustrated when they were told they wouldn't get paid for their services leading up to the Blackjewel bankruptcy, CNN reported.\n\nThe protests stopped last month.\n\nThe New York Times reported lawyers representing the miners in bankruptcy proceedings estimated the employees were each owed about $4,200.\n\nAbout a month after the company went under, a final load of coal with an estimated worth in excess of $1 million was due to be shipped out.\n\nThe miners found their bargaining chip.\n\nPolice confront activists supporting a group of unemployed Blackjewel coal miners on August 24, as they blockade the railroad tracks that lead to the mine where the miners once worked. That ultimately led to the out-of-business company awarding $5millon in back pay\n\nFor two months during the summer, the once-small blockade of former Blackjewel miners grew into a small tent city with the slogan 'No Pay We Stay' as they demanded back pay for work done leading up a bankruptcy\n\nThe blockade of the valuable shipment began on the afternoon of July 29, with a handful of miners and their families, camped on the tracks near the Cloverlick No. 3 mine.\n\nFor two months during the summer, the once-small blockade grew into a small tent city with a 'No Pay We Stay.'\n\nThe miners and their supporters at the railway camp refused to allow the shipment's passage until they received the wages due.\n\nPeople sat in chairs, forming a human chain across the tracks and holding signs that say: 'No pay, we stay'.\n\nAlthough the paychecks have been paid out, their benefits have not.\n\nVacation pay, retirement and health savings account contributions were not covered in the settlement, and mediation begins in early November to resolve these issues.\n\nBut former Kentucky mine employee Brandon Pearson told CNN the miners are 'relieved' and the money 'came right on time with Christmas approaching.'\n\nThe miners even got thrown into the presidential race when Democratic candidate Senator Bernie Sanders, reportedly sent 18 pizzas to them last Friday. Other politicians have also voiced their support as well as local churches, restaurants and businesses.\n\nDemand for coal has dropped off in the U.S., with the number of active mines decreased by more than half, from 1,435 mines in 2008 to 671 mines in 2017, according to the U.S Energy Information Administration and US Department of Labor, Mine Safety and Health Administration.", "description": "Former Blackjewel coal miners end months of protests and a layoff with a $5milllon deal for back pay after company's sudden bankruptcy.
