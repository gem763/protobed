Even if the rules did not change, the online form did change to remove a first-hand information requirement \u2014 apparently to justify the complaint against Trump.\n\nLast week, The Federalist pointed out an odd coincidence: the intelligence community website for whistleblowers uploaded a new version of its form for complaints, which had been updated in August 2019 \u2014 just as the so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u201d was talking to Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) and the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nThe new form omits a warning that first-hand information is required for a complaint to be processed as an \u201curgent concern.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post\u2018s fact-checker, Glenn Kessler, attacked The Federalist and Trump \u2014 and claimed that the story was \u201cemblematic of how inaccurate news flows into the president\u2019s Twitter account.\u201d He gave \u201cfour Pinnochios\u201d to Trump\u2019s claim that the whistleblower rules had been changed just before the complaint had been submitted.\n\nBut Kessler had to admit that The Federalist was right about its central claim: namely, the warning that only first-hand information would be accepted had been eliminated from the new form.\n\nThat did not mean the \u201crules\u201d had changed; indeed, Kessler argued, they had not been updated since 2016. But Kessler could not explain \u2014 and did not try to explain \u2014 why the warning about first-hand information had been dropped from the online submission form.\n\nInstead, Kessler made three arguments. First, he argued, the law itself does not require first-hand information. (He admits that he relied, in part, on the son of the attorney for the so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u201d in obtaining that opinion.) Second, he noted, both versions of the online form allowed whistleblowers to check a box indicating that they had second-hand information. And third, the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d in this case actually used the old form, not the new one. (The \u201cwhistleblower\u201d actually checked both boxes, claiming to have both first-hand and second-hand information.)\n\nTo summarize thus far: The Federalist was right that the form was changed to remove a warning that required first-hand information. Trump thought \u2014 as others did \u2014 that meant the \u201crules\u201d had changed, but they probably had not. And it may not have mattered anyway, because the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d used the old form to submit the complaint.\n\nBut if the rules had not been changed, why was there ever a warning against relying on second-hand information?\n\nThe Office of the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community (ICIG) issued a response to the controversy, in which it claimed that the statute does not require first-hand information, and said the old form \u201ccould be read \u2013 incorrectly \u2013 as suggesting that whistleblowers must possess first-hand information.\u201d It added that the so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u201d had \u201cdirect knowledge of certain alleged conduct\u201d that he or she described in the complaint.\n\nBut it is not clear, from the text of the complaint itself, what first-hand knowledge the so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u201d actually had. The \u201cwhistleblower\u201d admits that he or she \u201cwas not a direct witness to most of the events described,\u201d but never explains what he or she actually witnessed directly. The complaint claims to have \u201creceive[d]\u201d a \u201creadout\u201d of the Ukraine call, but it was not the \u201creadout\u201d or \u201ctranscript\u201d that the White House later posted, to much fanfare. Rather, that \u201creadout\u201d was a public document originally published in Russian on the Ukrainian president\u2019s website.\n\nThe complaint also cites media reports, but these hardly qualify as first-hand information. Rather, they seem to have been invoked to express concern about the administration\u2019s foreign policy. They reflect the sort of \u201cdifferences of opinions concerning public policy matters\u201d that the statute specifically excludes from whistleblower complaints.\n\nAs for the \u201cincorrect\u201d form, the ICIG explains that it was updated after a \u201cnewly hired Director for the Center for Protected Disclosures\u201d arrived in June 2019. It adds that the form was replaced \u201c[i]n the process of reviewing and clarifying those forms, and in response to recent press inquiries regarding the instant whistleblower complaint\u201d (emphasis added).\n\nIt admits that the form was changed at least partly to fit the facts of this \u201cwhistleblower\u201d case.\n\nThe Federalist, and the president, could be forgiven for concluding \u2014 as any reasonable person would \u2014 the rules had changed.\n\nAt the very least, the ICIG should explain why it \u201cincorrectly\u201d required first-hand information until now.\n\nJoel B.
