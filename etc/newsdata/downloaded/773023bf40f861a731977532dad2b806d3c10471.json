The Pixel Buds 2 are smaller and lighter, and they also ditch that fabric-covered cord that connected the original pair. They\u2019re truly wireless earbuds now, and that makes them a better contender against Apple\u2019s AirPods, the Samsung Galaxy Buds, and others.\n\nWe won\u2019t know exactly how they sound or how well they\u2019ll work till 2020, since Google won\u2019t be shipping them until then. But what we can talk about right now is their design and fit, which is more important to some consumers than even sound quality, and just how much competition they already have right now.\n\nA lot of wireless earbuds are unattractive, can sometimes fall out of people\u2019s ears, and may involve tons of tinkering to keep them snug and comfortable. The reason AirPods have been so successful, despite the obvious audio quality drawbacks, is that they work well with the iPhone, have an acceptable look (some people may disagree), and fit well for most users. Google will have to hit many of the same comfort and style marks \u2014 and hopefully work well with Pixel devices \u2014 if it wants its buds to be a proper Android analog to Apple\u2019s.\n\nWe\u2019ve rounded up some of the Pixel Buds 2\u2019s biggest competitors below, while listing a few key specs like battery life and price. Plus, you get to see how these devices actually look in people\u2019s ears, which can be a deal-breaker depending on the model and your personal preference.\n\nLet\u2019s start with Google\u2019s new contender.\n\nEarbuds weight: TBA\n\nTBA Charging case size: TBA\n\nTBA Battery life: five hours (up to 24 hours with charging case)\n\nfive hours (up to 24 hours with charging case) Price: $179\n\nThe Pixel Buds 2 certainly look like a huge improvement over the original Pixel Buds, which protruded out of your ears and suffered from an awkward bud design that meant they needed constant adjustment. The Verge\u2019s Sean O\u2019Kane described the original model as \u201cfull of little flaws that make life with them a frustration\u201d in his rather lukewarm review.\n\nThe new Pixel Buds, however, look much smaller and lighter, although Google hasn\u2019t released full specs yet. According to The Verge\u2019s Nilay Patel, who tried them on at Google\u2019s Tuesday event, they fit much better, too.\n\nEarbud weight: 0.25 ounces each\n\n0.25 ounces each Charging case size: 2.6 x 2.6 x 1.1 inches\n\n2.6 x 2.6 x 1.1 inches Battery life: five hours (up to 24 hours with charging case)\n\nfive hours (up to 24 hours with charging case) Price: $179 (but do not buy them)\n\nJust one look at these original Pixel Buds, compared to the second-gen version, is enough to make you run for the hills. Plus, that cord is doing no one any favors. It\u2019s a good thing Google was able to experiment here with a first-generation version, but I think we\u2019re all in agreement that this was used mainly to pave the way for Google\u2019s sequel and shouldn\u2019t be anyone\u2019s wireless earbuds of choice.\n\nEarbud weight: 0.14 ounces each\n\n0.14 ounces each Charging case size: 1.7 x 0.84 x 2.1 inches\n\n1.7 x 0.84 x 2.1 inches Battery: five hours (up to 24 hours with charging case)\n\nfive hours (up to 24 hours with charging case) Price: $199.99 ($159.99 without wireless charging case)\n\nAirPods are in a league of their own, and not just because they\u2019ll connect faster to the iPhone, thanks to Apple\u2019s H1 and W1 chips, than a non-iOS device. Apple\u2019s take on the earbuds refashioned its EarPods design into a wireless pair of headphones by simply clipping the cord, allowing them to maintain the company\u2019s long-iconic earbud design.\n\nYes, there\u2019s no interchangeable silicone bud tips to size them to your ears, and you have to contend with that extra-long cylinder trailing down the side of your jawline. All that said, AirPods work well, fit great if you do happen to have the right ear shape for them, and are incredibly lightweight.\n\nEarbuds weight: 0.25 ounces each\n\n0.25 ounces each Charging case size: 2.9 x 1.3 x 1 inches\n\n2.9 x 1.3 x 1 inches Battery life: eight hours (up to 24 hours with charging case)\n\neight hours (up to 24 hours with charging case) Price: $250\n\nMicrosoft isn\u2019t going to win any awards in the fashionable design department with its Surface Buds; they\u2019re gigantic, even if that satellite dish-looking design is supposed to facilitate more granular touch interactions. Then again, Microsoft isn\u2019t really going for sleek and stylish.\n\nThe company made the Surface Buds to work as an office tool as much as a music-playing device, so they can live transcribe what you\u2019re saying as you give a presentation, then summon Cortana with a long press on the side of the buds. But don\u2019t worry. If you\u2019re wearing these around in public, we\u2019ll assume you\u2019re just taking a really important call.\n\nEarbuds weight: 0.27 ounces each\n\n0.27 ounces each Charging case size : 2.2 x 3 x 1.1 inches\n\n: 2.2 x 3 x 1.1 inches Battery life: five hours (up to 20 with the charging case)\n\nfive hours (up to 20 with the charging case) Price: $129.99\n\nAmazon entered the wireless earbud market last month, just a week before Microsoft\u2019s entrance with its Surface Buds. But where Microsoft went higher-end and business-focused, Amazon is going for cheaper and more consumer-friendly. The Echo Buds look just fine, if not a bit on the larger end.\n\nThat\u2019s to be expected, as Amazon appears to have adopted longtime wireless earbud maker Jabra\u2019s overall look and feel. But hey, for a price that low, plus the noise isolation and Alexa voice features, that seems like a solid deal.\n\nEarbuds weight: 0.2 ounces each\n\n0.2 ounces each Charging case size : 1.5 x 2.8 x 1 inches\n\n: 1.5 x 2.8 x 1 inches Battery: six hours (up to 13 hours with charging case)\n\nsix hours (up to 13 hours with charging case) Price: $129.99\n\nI\u2019ll say it: I think the Samsung Galaxy Buds look awful. And in my personal experience using them, they did not fit great either, although they did come with plenty of interchangeable bud tips. Granted, these are among the cheapest name brand wireless ear buds you can buy, so it\u2019s understandable that you\u2019d take some hits in the design, comfort, and sound department, and we found that to be true in our official Galaxy Buds review. One area the Galaxy Buds do hold up is battery life, if that\u2019s a consideration.\n\nEarbuds weight: 0.23 ounces each\n\n0.23 ounces each Charging case size: 3.1 x 1.8 x 1.4 inches\n\n3.1 x 1.8 x 1.4 inches Battery: four hours (up to 12 hours with charging case)\n\nfour hours (up to 12 hours with charging case) Price: $299.95\n\nWhat Sennheiser\u2019s Momentum True Wireless earbuds lack in aesthetics, they make up for in sound quality \u2014 at a price. These are among the most expensive wireless ear buds you can buy, and they\u2019re also reportedly plagued by some battery and connectivity issues. So while they may be more comfortable than some and sound better than most, it\u2019s hard to square that with the price tag and the apparent issues that have gone unsolved.\n\nEarbuds weight: 0.3 ounces each\n\n0.3 ounces each Charging case size: 5.6 x 4.7 x 2.5 inches\n\n5.6 x 4.7 x 2.5 inches Battery: six hours with noise canceling and eight hours without (up to 24 hours with charging case; 32 hours with noise cancellation turned off)\n\nsix hours with noise canceling and eight hours without (up to 24 hours with charging case; 32 hours with noise cancellation turned off) Price: $229.99\n\nSony\u2019s latest iteration of wireless earbuds are perhaps the biggest, most protruding model on the market right now. It looks like an antiquated Bluetooth earpiece, granted a much more attractive one than those gadgets of old. That said, Sony has a lot going for it to justify that design. It\u2019s got amazing noise cancellation, incredible battery life, and superb sound quality. (It\u2019s also one of the more pricey options.)\n\nThe not-so-subtle design is the trade-off you have to endure for features like those. Also, take a look at the weight of its giant, premium charging case. That\u2019s not too easy to carry around compared to other models.\n\nEarbuds weight: 0.36 ounces each\n\n0.36 ounces each Charging case size: N/A\n\nN/A Battery: nine hours (up to 24 hours with charging case)\n\nnine hours (up to 24 hours with charging case) Price: $249.95\n\nIf Sony\u2019s WF-1000XM3 headphones are the feature-packed yet relatively stylish approach to a pricey, protruding pair of wireless earbuds, the Powerbeats Pro is what you get when you just don\u2019t care what you look like when wearing an electronic device literally on your head.\n\nThese things scream exercise headphones, which they indeed are designed to be, and they have that old-school wrap-around design a lot of wireless headphone makers have all but abandoned. They also appear to weigh a lot more than the competition. But according to former Verge headphone aficionado Vlad Savov, these earbuds have fantastic fit, sound incredible, and come with unbeatable battery life.\n\nEarbuds weight: 0.2 ounces for left bud and 0.23 ounces for right bud\n\n0.2 ounces for left bud and 0.23 ounces for right bud Charging case size: 4.9 x 7.3 x 2.2 inches\n\n4.9 x 7.3 x 2.2 inches Battery: five hours (up to 15 hours with charging case)\n\nfive hours (up to 15 hours with charging case) Price: $169.99\n\nJabra\u2019s Elite line was among the first to really crack the combination of battery life, connectivity, and sound quality that let the headphone market make way for true wireless earbuds, and not just over-the-ear cans.\n\nThat said, the Elite 65T, which came out last year and are about to be superseded by the new but similar-looking 75T model, aren\u2019t the most attractive pair of buds out there. They do come with customizable bud tips, but one common complaint is that they get rather uncomfortable during extended listening. But they\u2019re more discreet than most, and get the job done in the event you\u2019re no fan of AirPods and aren\u2019t looking to spend more than $200.\n\nEarbuds weight: 0.21 ounces each\n\n0.21 ounces each Charging case size: 2.9 x 1.4 x 0.9 inches\n\n2.9 x 1.4 x 0.9 inches Battery life: six hours (up to 16 with charging case)\n\nsix hours (up to 16 with charging case) Price: $179.99\n\nJaybird, like Jabra, has been at this quite a while, long before the any of the Big Five tech giants got in on the wireless earbud game. Now owned by Logitech, Jaybird returned to the market this summer with the Vista, an update to its Run earbuds with a focus on outdoor exercise and running.\n\nThey\u2019re pretty low-key in the design department, and the relative low weight puts them on par with the standard consumer earbuds from other tech companies, but with the added benefit of IPX7 waterproofing. Jaybird also makes some nice earbud tip replacements that come in the box for finding a proper fit.\n\nEarbuds weight: 0.31 ounces each for Plus / 0.26 ounces each for Go\n\n0.31 ounces each for Plus / 0.26 ounces each for Go Charging case size: 2.5 x 1.8 x 1 inches for Plus / 2.5 x 1.6 x 1.1 inches for Go\n\n2.5 x 1.8 x 1 inches for Plus / 2.5 x 1.6 x 1.1 inches for Go Battery life: 10 hours (up to 40 hours with charging case) for Plus / 10 hours (up to 22 hours with charging case) for Go\n\n10 hours (up to 40 hours with charging case) for Plus / 10 hours (up to 22 hours with charging case) for Go Price: $299.99 for Plus / $199.99 for Go\n\nMaster & Dynamic are well known for making some of the best consumer-grade over-the-year cans out there, and the company brings the same high build quality and visual flair to its earbuds. The newest set, the MW07 Plus and the cheaper Go variant, carry over the original MW07\u2019s sleek, industrial look with pearlescent and pastel color schemes, for the Plus and Go respectively.\n\nThankfully, the premium-looking chrome charging case has remained intact, too, which now packs an eye-popping 40 hours (or 22 hours on the Go). Sure, they cost a lot and are mighty heavy, but they look so much better than your standard wireless earbud.", "description": "Google introduced an update to its two-year-old Pixel Buds headphones on Tuesday.
