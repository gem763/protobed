Nine months later, the investigation into their deaths remains open\n\n'These nine months have been dreadful and painful for us,' Alexa's father, Carlos Montez (pictured), told News4 on Tuesday - which would have been his daughter's 17th birthday\n\nMontez said the family held off on burials for Nichol, Alexa and London, in case investigators find a reason to take a second look at the bodies.\n\n'We're coming to the point where the families are ready for this closure, so I think we're going to be moving forward with burials soon,' he said.\n\nThe family held off on burials for Nichol, Alexa and London, in case investigators find a reason to take a second look at the bodies\n\nOn Tuesday night, Montez invited Alexa's former classmates to join the family for a celebration of what would have been her birthday at Kingsborough Ridge Baptist Church.\n\n'We had to do something for her,' the father said. 'We all want some form of closure, but it almost feels like this whole entire process has just been put on pause.'\n\nThe group, many of them wearing shirts with Alexa's initials, released butterflies before planting a tree dedicated to the slain teen.\n\n'I think it just shows how many people she impacted,' Alexa's boyfriend, Isaiah Elizondo, told News4. 'How many smiles she put on everybody's faces.'\n\n'I feel like her presence is always with me,' said Allie Espinosa, a close friend to Alexa. 'I always feel her around.'\n\nMontez said the event served as a happy reminder of Alexa's ability to bring people together.\n\n'For the 16 years that I had her, she was an amazing kid. I was grateful to be her father,' he said.\n\nAlexa (pictured) would have turned 17 years old this week\n\nOn Tuesday night, Montez invited Alexa's former classmates to join the family for a celebration of what would have been her birthday at Kingsborough Ridge Baptist Church\n\nSeveral loved ones wore shirts with Alexa's initials on them during Tuesday's celebration\n\nThe Bexar County Sheriff's Office confirmed this week that the investigation into the three deaths is still under investigation but did not provide any information beyond what was revealed in January.\n\nThe bodies were found inside a home that belonged to her boyfriend, Charles Wheeler, at an Anaqua Springs Ranch subdivision.\n\nAll three victims had suffered gunshot wounds to their upper bodies and a gun was recovered from the scene but no other information about their injuries or where the gun was has been released.\n\nThe Bexar County Medical Examiner, based on the scene found, ruled shortly afterwards that Nichol committed suicide and that the girls had been murdered.\n\nSpeaking to DailyMail.com on January 21, Salazar said the medical examiner had not released the autopsies or given any additional information about their deaths.\n\nWheeler, Olsen's boyfriend of one year, told police he stayed the night at a relative's home out of town the night before the bodies were found and insists he came home at 9am to find the grisly scene.\n\nHe had been labeled a person of interest but the sheriff repeatedly refused to name him as a suspect while his lawyer emphasized his innocence.\n\nDuring the January interview, a frustrated Salazar said he was waiting for cell phone data to verify Wheeler's alibi. He said other key pieces of evidence - such as neighborhood surveillance footage that would document the hours before the bodies were found - had been difficult to come by.\n\nSalazar and his detectives were also operating under the theory that all three women may have been killed by someone who is on 'no one's radar'.\n\n'This case is far from over... I wish it was like TV and you could solve it in an hour. It just doesn't work like that,' he told DailyMail.com.\n\n'I wish they could have wrapped this case up for the closure of the family.'\n\nThe bodies were found inside a mansion owned by Nichol's boyfriend, Charles Wheeler\n\nAN UNLIKELY SUICIDE\n\nSpeaking to DailyMail.com in January, Sheriff Salazar said the crux of the mystery was rooted in the medical examiner's widely-contested ruling that Nichol (pictured) committed suicide\n\nSalazar said the crux of the mystery was rooted in the medical examiner's widely-contested ruling that Nichol committed suicide.\n\nThe medical examiner's office had not released any records to support its finding at the time of the interview.\n\nSalazar said he had not seen a piece of paper that states more than cause or manner of death and the lack of narrative which could explain such a theory is proving frustrating.\n\n'The medical examiner believes it\u2019s a suicide based on what they saw. They have a more limited evidence bank to pick from.\n\n'I have forensics and the crime scene and witness interviews and phone records and everything.\n\n'In some cases, when the ME rules suicide, there are other corroborating things. But in this instance, I don't have that.\n\n'I don't have a suicide note, a depressed phone call, a witness, I don't have any of these things. Most cases are just so much more clear cut than this one,' he told DailyMail.com.\n\n'I don't have a suicide note, a depressed phone call, a witness, I don't have any of these things Sheriff Jerry Salazar\n\nHe added that while he had no evidence to refute their finding yet, the case would be closed if he was satisfied with the theory that she killed herself and the girls.\n\n'If I didn't think there was even a slight chance [that all three were murdered], we would have written this case off a long time ago.'\n\nNichol was in the midst of promoting her hairdressing business and was planning to enter her daughter, London, on America's Got Talent the day after she died, according to friends.\n\nThey and her former husbands angrily dismissed the idea that she would ever have hurt her children.\n\nNichol's boyfriend, Charles Wheeler, was named as a person of interest but not as a suspect\n\nTHE BOYFRIEND'S ALIBI\n\nCharles Wheeler, Nichol's boyfriend, was never arrested or named as a suspect.\n\nSheriff Salazar told DailyMail.com in January: 'Mr Wheeler is a person of interest. That does not mean suspect.\n\n'We've talked to him and he's been cooperative. We know what he has told us.'\n\nWheeler was the person who called 911 at 9am on January 10 to say what he had found. He told Sheriff Salazar that he had spent the night in a different city at a relative's house.\n\nThe sheriff later revealed publicly that Wheeler and Nichol had an argument the night before she died.\n\nSalazar was waiting for his cell phone provider to hand over records, which he hoped would show the location of Wheeler's device the night before the deaths and the following morning.\n\nIt would, he hoped, verify his alibi or disqualify it. Despite the urgency of the case and Nichol's family's demands for answers, the phone company was dragging its feet.\n\n'We are at the mercy of this phone company over here and this crime lab over here.\n\n'We're patiently waiting. From a law enforcement perspective, it's frustrating. The delay frustrates me just as much as it does everyone else,' he said.\n\nThe data could take weeks yet to come back, he said, adding: 'There's a lot of stuff that is out of our control.'\n\nSheriff Jerry Salazar (pictured) spoke with DailyMail.com about the case in January\n\nA KILLER ON NO ONE'S RADAR\n\n'Here's the theory that we are entertaining - what if it was someone that wasn't even on our radar yet?' Sheriff Salazar said in January.\n\nHe implored anyone who lived near the home where the deaths happened or who knew Nichol or anyone involved to get in touch with his office.\n\nSpecifically, they hoped there may be surveillance footage of the gated community where the house is and its surroundings.\n\nIt was unlikely, he said, that it was a random killing carried out by a burglar, for example, but the department had not ruled it out.\n\n'It is a very secure neighborhood so the likelihood of that is remote but it would be irresponsible of us to rule that out,' he said.\n\n'The way we've collected evidence, we factored that theory in, we're following that lead as well.\n\n'It may be someone that we've not come across yet,' he said.\n\nLOVED ONES DESPERATE FOR ANSWERS\n\nNichol and the girls' many friends and family set up Facebook, Instagram and GoFundMe pages where they pleaded for support and answers.\n\nThey were not satisfied either with the lack of information and fear a dangerous killer is on the loose.\n\nLondon, the youngest victim, loved monkeys and had asked her paternal aunt to help build the monkeys at Austin Zoo a bigger enclosure if she ever died.\n\nHer aunt launched a GoFundMe page to work with the zoo and fund a memorial enclosure to her niece. It has raised $6,700 of its $20,000 goal as of October 10.\n\nAnother GoFundMe set up to 'search for the truth', raised more than $50,000.\n\nAlexa Montez, Nichol's 16-year-old daughter, was eulogized by friends and her father as a loving and sweet cheerleader.\n\nNichol's friends described her as a fiercely protective mother, loving sister, friend and businesswoman.\n\nHer oldest child, Skylar, 22, has not spoken publicly of his mother or sisters' deaths.\n\nAnyone with information about the case is urged to contact the BCSO Homicide Office at 210-335-6070 or email BCSOtips@bexar.org.", "description": "Nichol Olsen and her daughters - 10-year-old London Bribiescas and 16-year-old Alexa Montez - were found dead on January 10 in Leon Springs, Texas.", "authors": ["Megan Sheets", "Jennifer Smith For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/21/19558130-0-image-a-16_1570740417530.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
