REUTERS/Sarah Silbiger/File Photo\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders was hospitalized on Tuesday with chest pains that required doctors to insert two stents after finding a blockage in one artery, and he will cancel his campaign events until further notice, his campaign said.\n\nSanders, 78, was in Las Vegas, Nevada, as part of the 2020 campaign when he experienced discomfort and was taken to a hospital for evaluation.\n\n\u201cFollowing medical evaluation and testing he was found to have a blockage in one artery and two stents were successfully inserted,\u201d Sanders senior adviser Jeff Weaver said in a statement.\n\n\u201cSen. Sanders is conversing and in good spirits. He will be resting up over the next few days. We are cancelling his events and appearances until further notice, and we will continue to provide appropriate updates,\u201d Weaver said.\n\nSanders, the oldest candidate among the 19 contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination, was scheduled on Wednesday to hold a town hall in Las Vegas and appear at a gun safety forum.\n\nHe has been among the top contenders in the crowded field seeking the nomination to challenge Republican President Donald Trump.\n\nThe campaign halt comes the day after Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, reported a big $25.3 million fundraising haul for the third quarter, putting him in the early lead in the money race.\n\n\u201cThinking of @BernieSanders today and wishing him a speedy recovery. If there\u2019s one thing I know about him, he\u2019s a fighter and I look forward to seeing him on the campaign trail soon,\u201d Democratic rival Kamala Harris, a U.S. senator from California, said on Twitter.", "description": "U.S. presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders was hospitalized on Tuesday with chest pains that required doctors to insert two stents after finding a blockage in one artery, and he will cancel his campaign events until further notice, his campaign said.", "authors": ["John Whitesides", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436283165&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9116P"}
