The company raised $95 million in Series D funding in February, so that brings its total fundraising round to $215 million.\n\nThe company has more than 50 autonomous trucks, which operate with a safety driver and an engineer in the cabin, and more than 18 contracted customers. TuSimple, which has a $1 billion valuation, runs daily revenue-generating routes in Arizona.\n\nRead more: Amazon Web Services is underpinning the technology at a $1 billion driverless trucking startup \u2014 and it shows how Amazon wants to control its supply chain and cut its $28 billion yearly shipping bill\n\nAlong with capital from CDH Investments and Mando Corporation, part of this new funding round is a minority investment stake by package giant UPS.\n\nUPS and TuSimple made headlines last month when they announced that they had been moving UPS loads in self-driving trucks between Phoenix and Tucson for months \u2014 unbeknownst to the public. That investment and piloting was seen as a bellwether for self-driving trucks to arrive in the next five to 10 years, rather than further down the line.\n\n\"We're very fortunate to have these shareholders and now new investors,\" Cheng Lu, CFO at TuSimple, told Business Insider. \"It puts us, I would say, well ahead of the pack in terms of our funding. We're very well capitalized to continue our development effort as we progress to commercial production.\"\n\nTuSimple aims to have the engineer and driver out of TuSimple trucks by 2021, and then to have those truly autonomous trucks available on the market by 2023.\n\nCourtesy of TuSimple\n\nThe industry transformations that self-driving trucks promise are massive \u2014 for better and for worse. The economy would save an estimated $300 billion, and productivity in the trucking industry jump by 30%, because driverless trucks would be capable of running 24/7. Carbon emissions would also plummet, experts say.\n\nHowever, the jobs of more than 1.8 million truck drivers, along with the jobs of millions of others who depend on the trucking industry, would be at risk.", "description": "One self-driving ttuck startup has been beating Tesla and Waymo in the race for autonomous big rigs.
