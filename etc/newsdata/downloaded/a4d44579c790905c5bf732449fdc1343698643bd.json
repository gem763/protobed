I like to serve it as a starter, but it's also good as part of a Thai meal, with other dishes and steamed sticky rice.\n\nFresh shrimp are easy to find in Asian markets, and although they take more time to prepare than frozen - because you have to remove the shells and heads, then devein them - the results are far superior. As with all seafood, overcooking will make the shrimp tough.\n\nThe shrimp are fried in Thai tempura flour, which gives a hard crunch that is very different from what you get with Japanese tempura flour. It's often referred to as Gogi flour, from the name of a popular producer of the flour in Thailand.", "description": "This is a brightly flavoured dish that balances a lot of spice with cooling fresh mint and salad greens.
