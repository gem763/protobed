There I said it! The matte glass back is elegant. The OLED display is slightly brighter than I expected, which is clever. The trypophobia-inducing camera bump is sleeker than it looks in photos, and the ability to zoom in and out is pretty cool. The iPhone 11 Pro is a little faster.\n\nThese are all gentle little upgrades from the iPhone XS, and they\u2019re nice. They are, unfortunately for some, all you get. Still, I want this phone because it\u2019s just a little bit nicer than the phone I\u2019ve got.\n\niPhone 11 Pro WHAT IS IT? A new premium iPhone COST $1,749 and up LIKE Terrific camera system, gorgeous design NO LIKE Expensive, not all that different than the iPhone 11\n\nIt\u2019s a tired argument to point out how iPhone innovation has stalled. Ten years ago, these little pocket computers were transforming our lives on an annual basis with new features and design upgrades. These days, we\u2019re squinting at specs and doing maths to figure out if upgrading to the latest device makes sense for the near future.\n\nThe one big new thing for all smartphones, 5G, won\u2019t even matter to most people for another year or two or more. And while some Android phone manufacturers are getting creative with new features, most people are now waiting longer to upgrade, giving the major players less motivation to reinvent their devices completely. That seems to be exactly how Apple decided to build the iPhone 11 Pro: surely better but not yet transformative.\n\nMy problem is that I don\u2019t want to care. I like my iPhone XS just fine. The iPhone 11 Pro isn\u2019t all that radically different, but it is better. It looks better. It feels better. When I use it, I feel good. I don\u2019t care that it can\u2019t support 5G. I don\u2019t mind that Apple left off a bunch of rumoured features. I find myself marvelling over the little, better things.\n\nThe matte glass back really does feel luxurious. The display is crisp. The new camera system rocks. I wonder what I could do with this slightly better A13 Bionic processor. I like the iPhone 11 Pro, and given the choice, I would buy it over the more pedestrian but still excellent iPhone 11. Then again, I am falling in line with Apple\u2019s very smart marketing.\n\nIt would be convenient \u2014 and save me a bunch of money \u2014 if I could just say that I hate the iPhone 11 Pro. Not the case. I want the damn thing, not because it has a million new mind-boggling tricks but because the few new things are impressive and make the whole experience better. I\u2019m part of the Apple Upgrade Program, so it\u2019s relatively easy for me to trade in my XS for a Pro. I still wouldn\u2019t recommend that folks with an X-series phone upgrade to the 11 Pro. But I dare you not to hate what Apple\u2019s done with its latest masterpiece.\n\nNow that my demons are on full display, let\u2019s talk about what makes the iPhone 11 Pro special: the camera. And some other things but mostly the camera.\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro is the first and only iPhone to sport three cameras on the back. The setup includes the Wide and Telephoto cameras seen on the iPhone XS as well as a new Ultra Wide camera. This gives the iPhone 11 Pro the ability to zoom in and out.\n\nThe inclusion of the third camera is also a big differentiator between the Pro and the basic iPhone 11, which only has the Wide and Ultra Wide cameras. (This means the cheaper iPhone 11 does not have an optical zoom in.) It also feels like a bit of a trick. The optical zoom-in has made the second camera on an iPhone feel special since its first appearance in 2016. So if you\u2019re deciding between the regular 11 and the 11 Pro, consider that you\u2019re paying for the telephoto camera more than anything.\n\nThe 6.5-inch iPhone 11 Pro Max is just like the 5.8-inch iPhone 11 Pro, except it has an extra hour of battery life. (Photo: Raul Marrero, Gizmodo)\n\nAll the cameras are better, though. This was immediately obvious to me when I started taking photos with the iPhone 11 Pro and compared them to the same shots from the iPhone XS, Google Pixel 3, and Samsung Galaxy S10. The iPhone 11 Pro photos were sharper, more vibrant, and more accurate than those of the competitors. In fact, the difference between the XS and the Pro was so significant, I felt like a dumbass for buying the XS based on the belief that its camera was better than the one on the iPhone X. It was, but by contrast, the iPhone 11 Pro camera feels like a completely new and amazing thing.\n\nThe biggest deal, to me, is Night mode. It\u2019s mind-blowing, and it\u2019s only available on the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro. Basically, Night Mode allows you to take photos in near darkness. The option is triggered automatically in the camera app, so you don\u2019t have to bother remembering to turn it on.\n\nA little moon icon in the corner of the camera app appears and tells you how long the exposure will last, and then, when you take the photo, you\u2019re given a little countdown that reminds you to keep the camera still. Even if you do wiggle a little, the iPhone will pick a keyframe for sharpness and fill in the details with a composite of additional frames. Given the darkness, you\u2019d expect the finished result to be grainy or blurred, but it\u2019s clear and sharp if a little tinted.\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro\u2019s Night Mode produces the most accurate and best-looking shots in low light. (Photo: Adam Clark Estes, Gizmodo)\n\nI compared Night mode to Google\u2019s similar Night Shift feature on the Pixel 3, and for lack of a better clich\u00e9, the difference is like day and night. Apple\u2019s new low light magic can snap useable photos in near darkness, and the results are dramatically different than the same photo from the Pixel 3 camera, which tended to over brighten photos taken in very dim environments creating an unnatural, washed-out look with inaccurate colours.\n\nIn my tests, Night Mode makes the iPhone XS and Samsung Galaxy S10 cameras look like jokes in low light. I should reiterate, however, that Night mode is available on both the iPhone 11 and the iPhone 11 Pro. Again, the addition of the telephoto camera and more optical zoom capabilities is what you get by going Pro.\n\nThe Telephoto camera does feel essential to me. Pressing and holding any of the zoom options in the camera app also brings up a wheel that lets you toggle between a bunch of different focal lengths for more precise zooming.\n\nThis makes framing photos more intentional, but it\u2019s evident that the Ultra Wide camera introduces some pretty weird distortion, some of which almost looks like a fish-eye lens produced them. I\u2019d also point out that using the focus wheel itself could be smoother, as the sensitivity feels slightly off and it\u2019s easy to notice when the app switches between the three cameras. Regardless, I can already tell that these new zoom options will change the way I take photos with my phone.\n\nThe difference between the three cameras on the iPhone Pro: Ultra Wide (left), Wide (centre), Telephoto (right) (Photo: Adam Clark Estes, Gizmodo)\n\nMore than anything, though, the quality of photos taken with iPhone 11 Pro is supreme. Thanks to the new A13 Bionic processor, the phone takes computational photographic magic tricks to a new level. This is most apparent in the sharpness of the photos. Apple has mercifully fixed the smoothing issue that people complained about on the iPhone XS camera \u2014 the one that made details look super soft if you looked closely.\n\nMeanwhile, the new iPhone handles difficult lighting situations, like literally shooting straight into the Sun, with remarkable results. Later this year, Apple says it will release a new feature called Deep Fusion that uses machine learning and neural networks to make photos even sharper and more lifelike. This will be available on both the iPhone 11 and the iPhone 11 Pro which, again, are two very similar phones in terms of significant features.\n\nYou can probably see by now that I\u2019m feeling conflicted about the little differences between the $1,199 iPhone 11 and the $1,749 iPhone 11 Pro. Based on my inventory, there are only five fundamental difference between the two devices. The third camera is one of them. Then, there\u2019s the OLED display on the Pro versus the LCD on the 11 \u2014 that\u2019s two.\n\nThe third is the dumb little fact that the iPhone 11 Pro comes with an 18-watt charging brick in the box, whereas you\u2019ll have to pay over $50 to get that for the cheaper iPhone 11. Fourth is the better battery life on the iPhone Pro. Battery life is better on all the devices, but Apple says there\u2019s are four more hours of battery on the iPhone 11 Pro than on the iPhone XS. (Five for the iPhone 11 Pro Max.) We struggled to kill these devices in our battery tests. Our iPhone 11 Pro stayed alive well over an hour longer than what Apple\u2019s specs state. Our iPhone 11 Pro Max last an additional hour and change.\n\nPhoto: Raul Marrero, Gizmodo The new zoom wheel makes it easier to frame photos, but there\u2019s no indication when you switch from optical to (lower quality) digital zoom.

Photo: Raul Marrero, Gizmodo The camera bump is milled out of the same glass that\u2019s on the rest of back, but it\u2019s glossy, not matte. Photo: Raul Marrero, Gizmodo The iPhone 11 Pro bump actually protrudes less than the bump on the iPhone XS. Photo: Raul Marrero, Gizmodo And it looks cool, too!\n\nThe fifth thing is what gets me. It\u2019s the design, and it is gorgeous. From the front, the iPhone 11 Pro looks just like the iPhone XS and the iPhone X before it. The notch is still there, and the bezels on the sides are still kind of big compared to, say, a Samsung Galaxy S10. However, the new Pro model is very slightly thicker and wider than its predecessors.\n\nThe lock button is also slightly lower on the right side of the device, likely to accommodate the new camera bump. I\u2019m tempted to call it a big bump, but it\u2019s remarkable how well Apple has integrated it into the device\u2019s design. In a way, it\u2019s a smaller bump than what\u2019s on my tired XS, because it doesn\u2019t stick out as much. It blends into the glass on the back.\n\nThat matte back glass is also lovely as hell. It\u2019s annoying how much I like it. The glossy glass back on my iPhone XS always seemed fine, and now I can\u2019t believe how aggressively it attracts fingerprints. The iPhone 11 Pro, by contrast, has that silky smooth matte finish as well as a new oleophobic coating that keeps fingerprints at bay.\n\nThe front glass of an iPhone 11 Pro Max after a casual run-in with a rivet on my blue jeans. (Photo: Raul Marrero, Gizmodo)\n\nApple also says that the new glass is the toughest glass it\u2019s ever put in an iPhone. I learned all too quickly, however, that it\u2019s still not all that tough. In less than a week, I managed to scuff up the front of our iPhone 11 Pro Max review unit. The scratches definitely came from a rivet on my jeans, the same rivet that has scratched the front of my iPhone XS and my Google Pixel 3. It\u2019s an awfully aggressive rivet, but it still stinks that iPhone glass can scratch so easily. It\u2019s also my fault for never using a screen protector. (They bug me!)\n\nThe more time I spent with the iPhone 11 Pro, the more I dreaded going back to my XS. The more time I spent with the iPhone 11, the more I wished I were using the iPhone 11 Pro. The cheaper iPhone 11 is excellent and offers almost all of the same features as the iPhone 11 Pro. The iPhone 11 Pro, however, looks and feels like the superior device that it is. That premium feeling will cost you at least 500 more dollars, but if you\u2019re someone who really wants to own the best things, that feeling might be worth it.\n\nThe slight difference in size of camera bumps on the iPhone 11 Pro Max (left) and the iPhone (11 right) (Photo: Raul Marrero, Gizmodo)\n\nIf you\u2019re someone who thinks that the new \u201cpro\u201d moniker on this iPhone means you can do your job better, you\u2019re hallucinating. You do get that one extra camera on the iPhone 11 Pro, but there\u2019s nothing specific to professional smartphoning going on here.\n\nApple did have a demo that showed how the iPhone 11 Pro could record simultaneously on more than one camera, giving videographers the ability to get multiple shots with one device. This feature is also coming to the iPhone 11, XS and XR. The iPhone 11 Pro is just the fanciest iPhone you can buy right now. Even if it doesn\u2019t turn you into a Hollywood director overnight, you will feel good using the iPhone Pro. Apple is selling a feeling, after all.\n\nThe problem is, I\u2019m kind of buying it. While I haven\u2019t made up my mind about upgrading from my (scratched) iPhone XS, I\u2019m sure I\u2019d go for the iPhone 11 Pro if I did decide to get a new device. Cosmetic damage aside, I also don\u2019t need a new device. But I want an iPhone 11 Pro. Even if you don\u2019t want it, you\u2019re going to have a hard time not loving it.\n\nREADME", "description": "The iPhone 11 Pro is a beautiful phone. There I said it!
