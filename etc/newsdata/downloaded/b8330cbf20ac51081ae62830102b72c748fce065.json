But despite Crosby being on \u2018speed dial\u2019 to Johnson during his successful leadership campaign, which was managed by Fullbrook, relations with the one-time gurus have \u2018distinctly cooled\u2019 after a series of negative briefings about the PM\u2019s new team found their way into the tabloids.\n\nA source whispers: \u2018Lots of people seem to be struggling to come to terms with the new regime and are lashing out, looking for people to blame.\u2019\n\nOfficially, it\u2019s all sweetness and light, but senior Tories confirm neither man will play \u2018a leading role\u2019 in the coming campaign.\n\nOlly well done, old boy!\n\nChampagne all round at the National Liberal Club, the ornate Thames-side private members\u2019 townhouse beloved by well-heeled Liberal Democrats.\n\nMy spy snapped this congratulations on the club noticeboard to newly honoured Sir Oliver Robbins \u2013 Theresa May\u2019s controversial pro- EU Brexit negotiator, loathed and distrusted by Leavers and made a knight after quitting in failure.\n\nThe Government\u2019s loss is Goldman Sachs\u2019 gain...\n\nChampagne all round at the National Liberal Club, the ornate Thames-side private members\u2019 townhouse beloved by well-heeled Liberal Democrats\n\nIs Jo planning to score at Twickers?\n\nI hear private polling numbers in Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson\u2019s East Dunbartonshire seat are dire, with party insiders hinting she could perform a \u2018chicken run\u2019 to Twickenham to avoid a humiliating defeat to the SNP.\n\nHowever, the Libs have already selected a candidate to replace the retiring Sir Vince Cable.\n\nGiven the south-west London seat is a jewel in their crown, having been yellow for all but two years since 1997, there was some surprise when relative unknown Munira Wilson was selected for the plum constituency.\n\nThe party denies she is just keeping the seat warm, but it\u2019s one to watch...\n\n\u2018Saudi Arabia should be held to account, not embraced,\u2019 said Jeremy Corbyn in one of his regular tirades against the Government\u2019s ties to the controversial Gulf kingdom.\n\nSo the Labour leader may wish to have a quiet word with his MP Imran Hussain, who last week declared a luxury junket there including \u2018flights, internal travel, accommodation, food and documentation\u2019.\n\nThe Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia picked up the whopping \u00a320,000 bill for him and a guest less than ten months after the brutal murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi horrified the world.\n\nSecurity guards were startled by the Prime Minister loudly yelling \u2018No Deal\u2019 in the Downing Street garden very early in the morning.\n\nRather than rehearsing bellicose threats for next week\u2019s crunch EU Brexit showdown, Boris assured those concerned who had run to the scene that he was trying to get his puppy Dilyn, now known as \u2018Dil\u2019, to behave.\n\nWestminster's self-appointed Head Girl, Amber Rudd, stepped up her ongoing war on violent political rhetoric last week, accusing Downing Street of sounding \u2018angry and desperate\u2019 with words \u2018that I do not believe should be the language of a UK Government\u2019.\n\nRegular readers will remember her own rather aggressive resignation letter last month.\n\nBut now I hear the version that made it on to the Prime Minister\u2019s desk was actually toned down.\n\nThe original draft passed to me talked of \u2018reckless political arson\u2019, \u2018wanton culling\u2019 and Rudd refusing to be \u2018an innocent bystander any longer while our party is vandalised\u2019. Angry and desperate?\n\nWhatever could the Brexit Party\u2019s Ann Widdecombe have meant with her astonishing blast at fellow female Brexiteer Andrea Leadsom and her choice of \u2018awful\u2019 clothes? \u2018That micro skirt and plunging neckline,\u2019 she raged at the Business Secretary last week. \u2018I won\u2019t say what I thought you looked like because it really would not be terribly polite.\u2019 Surely the devout Catholic is not suggesting that yet another Tory Cabinet Minister has \u2018something of the night\u2019 about them?", "description": "HARRY COLE: Sir Lynton Crosby may have masterminded Boris Johnson's successful bids for City Hall and helped to put him in No 10, but I hear he will not be running his Election campaign.", "authors": ["Harry Cole Deputy Political Editor For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/21/19636614-0-image-a-7_1570913871016.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
