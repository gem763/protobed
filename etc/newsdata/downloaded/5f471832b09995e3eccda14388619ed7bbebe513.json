The economy is \u201cteetering on a recession,\u201d Joe Biden said a few days later, probably meaning that it is teetering on the edge of a recession. \u201cWe\u2019re now about to enter the Trump recession,\u201d said top Bernie Sanders aide Jeff Weaver. Democrats took note of a Washington Post poll saying that Trump\u2019s approval rating has fallen in light of the fact that 6 in 10 Americans fear a recession will arrive in the next year.\n\nSo on Thursday, at the Democratic Party\u2019s first one-night presidential debate, the first opportunity to showcase the party\u2019s ten leading candidates, what role did the nation\u2019s widespread economic anxieties play?\n\nAlmost none. The candidates simply didn\u2019t talk about it. (Nor did the ABC News moderators ask.) The word \u201crecession\u201d was uttered just once in the entire debate. (By Juli\u00e1n Castro, who noted the poll\u2019s finding of recession fears.) Nor was the word \u201cunemployment\u201d ever spoken. Nor was there a discussion of job creation. Nor was there much of a discussion of wages.", "description": "", "authors": ["Byron York", "Washingtonexaminer.Com Opinion Columnists In-Debate-Democrats-Steer-Clear-Of-Economy"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
