Here\u2019s how.\n\nOn the Extra Crunch stage at TechCrunch Disrupt SF, we had a deep conversation on what founders should do to prepare for an exit with Jess Lee of Sequoia, who sold her startup Polyvore to TechCrunch parent company Yahoo; Justin Kan, who sold Twitch to Amazon and now runs legal startup Atrium; and Mike Marquez, the founding managing director of boutique investment bank Code Advisors.\n\nThe good news is that the primary requirement for exiting a startup is really the same work that a founder has to focus on: building a great business. \u201cThe best way to sell your company is to actually build a good company,\u201d said Kan, since no acquirer is looking to buy damaged goods.\n\nBut even if you are building a solid business, that\u2019s not nearly enough to get a transaction done some time down the line. One consistent piece of advice from the group was that founders should be thinking about an exit much more regularly, even if they are steadfastly opposed to one. That means identifying key relationships that will make an M&A possible and working to build and maintain those relationships.\n\n\u201cI thought about it too late,\u201d Lee said about her time running Polyvore . \u201cThe same way you build relationships with investors, you should spend at least a little bit of time building relationships with partners who could become potential acquirers.\u201d\n\nKan elaborated further. \u201cI think that in the beginning, your responsibilities as a founder is just to find product-market fit [and] work on your product,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then once you have a product that people want, you want to figure out how to get it in the hands of more people, and that\u2019s when it starts to become really valuable to know everyone in your market and then adjacent markets.\u201d\n\nFar from being a completely separate task from the other duties of being a CEO, connecting with potential acquirers often has benefits for growing a company in the first place.", "description": "Startup founders have a million things to worry about every day.
