Adapted by Sarah Keating.\n\nWhen Kirsty Holden applied for flexible working after her second child was born, she had a battle on her hands.\n\nHolden loved her job working in the legal department of one the UK\u2019s biggest government agencies for 13 years. But despite her tenure, her request to change her working arrangements was rejected. She was forced to appeal. And Holden won \u2013 but when she returned to work on a part-time basis, she was made to feel like she didn\u2019t belong.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have a desk, which was horrible,\u201d she says. \u201cI know a lot of people hot desk, but I felt that it was because I was part time that I was no longer entitled to a desk. I just felt like a number \u2013 I just plugged the gaps, and it was not a nice feeling.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t particularly management that made her feel unwelcome, she said, but rather the working environment and the team around her. In the end Holden, 32, realised she was experiencing discrimination and bullying. She decided to go out on her own instead \u2013 and in doing so became part of a growing trend among working women to choose self-employment over traditional workplaces.", "description": "Working for yourself can be lonely and financially insecure.
