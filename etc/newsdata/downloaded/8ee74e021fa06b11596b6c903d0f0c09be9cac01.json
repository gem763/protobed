But, Trump warned that the sanctions could be re-imposed if Turkey fails to protect religious and ethnic minorities.\n\nTrump abruptly announced on Oct. 6 that U.S. troops would withdraw from northern Syria. Lawmakers accused Trump of abandoning Kurdish forces, who were key allies in the U.S. fight against ISIS. Turkey argues that the Kurdish fighters are terrorists.\n\nTrump used his remarks to push back against that criticism.\n\n\"The people that I watched and read giving me and the United States advice, were the people that I had been watching and reading for many years,\" he said. \"They are the ones that got us into the Middle East mess, but never had the vision or the courage to get us out, they just talked.\"\n\nThe announcement of the permanent cease-fire comes after a deal was reached on Tuesday between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The agreement calls for the withdrawal of Syrian Kurdish forces from the Turkish border and then joint military patrols of the area now occupied by the Kurdish military.", "description": "President Trump defended his decision to pull U.S. troops from Syria, arguing that it is time for the U.S. to end its involvement in Middle East conflicts.", "authors": ["Ayesha Rascoe"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/23/gettyimages-1177744503_wide-b3f31195d5a0a40f8e1df9ebb73db2a3c946c0af.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
