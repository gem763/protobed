It causes the nails to grow thick and curvy, and can be difficult to get rid of.\n\nThe patient's toenail had got to a really bad state, needing complete removal\n\nDr Todd Brennan ripped it off in one motion (pictured)\n\nDr Brennan starts by softening the skin around the sides and nail bed\n\nDr Brennan said the man's overgrown nail had been rubbing on his other toes, shoes and socks, but did not reveal how long it had been a problem.\n\nDue to the nail being so bad, the only option was to completely remove it because topical creams or oral medicines wouldn't help.\n\nThis is only done when the thickening is so bad that despite repeated clippings or standard treatment the nail does not return to its normal, healthy state.\n\nWHAT IS RAM'S HORN TOENAIL? Onychogryphosis is nicknamed ram\u2019s horn nails because the nails are thick and curvy, like horns or claws. Onychogryphosis mostly affects the toes \u2014 specifically the big toes. If you have onychogryphosis, your nails will look yellow or brown, unusually thick, long and curved. The condition will get worse with time, and can also cause ingrown nails, pain, infection, inability to exercise and time away from work. Causes include foot trauma, a fungal infection, psoriasis, peripheral vascular disease and ichthyosis skin condition.

Despite this, Dr Brennan said the toe should heal quickly.\n\nHe said: 'In two weeks it will be nice and smooth.'\n\nDr Anton Alexandroff, consultant dermatologist and British Skin Foundation spokesperson said: 'Rams horn nails are rare and only happen when a person neglects their nail care, forgetting to trim nails on a regular basis.\n\n'When toe nails are significantly longer and cannot easily be trimmed it\u2019s best to seek help from a medical professional.\n\n'This particular patient may also have a co-existing fungal infection which is likely to require additional topical or oral treatment.'\n\nThe Healthy Feet Podiatry, in Tampa, Florida, has 160,000 subscribers on YouTube who love to watch gory treatments.\n\nThe channel's most popular clip has amassed more than 14million views since it was published last year.", "description": "WARNING, GRAPHIC CONTENT: The unnamed patient was suffering with ram's horn nail,\u00a0onychogryphosis.
