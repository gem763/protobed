You were chased outside by customers that heard the way you behaved to the staff and heard you in the dining room acting strange.\n\n\u201cWhen you were threatened with being put on Facebook you came back and paid the little amount that it cost you to be served at our restaurant \u2013 and you still tried to avoid paying!\u201d\n\n(Image: derbytelegraph.co.uk)\n\nAfter Mr May's partner pointed out that it could be a breach of privacy laws, the restaurant replied: \u201cWhat GDPR? You come in to our restaurant and cause trouble and walk out without paying and you think this is normal?\n\n\u201cOf course we are going to put videos and pics of the event.\n\n\u201cBy the way, we only have decent customers come in - we very quickly make sure we do not accept people like your friends.\u201d\n\nMr May and his partner claim their reputations have been damaged and there could have been a breach of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) privacy laws.\n\nThey have complained to the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO).\n\nMr Palermo said he did not believe that the restaurant had breached any laws by posting CCTV images of the customers.\n\nRelated video:\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nHe claimed: \u201cThe customer caused problems in the restaurant. They were being very rude to the staff.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t want to pay. It\u2019s not fair. It\u2019s not correct. It\u2019s not a moral thing.\u201d\n\nHe added: \"The customers had gone outside. They walked outside the door. They left with their coats on. They told everyone they were leaving.\u201d\n\nMr Palermo denied that the man who intervened was an \u201cinvestor\u201d and claimed the man was just a customer.\n\nAn ICO spokesman said: \"Organisations that process personal data, including CCTV footage of identifiable individuals, need to ensure they comply with their obligations under data protection law.\n\n\u201cThis includes letting people know that you are collecting the footage, keeping the images secure, and only disclosing the images when it is necessary to do so.\u201d\n\nLa Pizza has been accused of being \"aggressive\" when responding to customer complaints online.\n\nOn at least two occasions it has posted screen grabs of a customer's Facebook page and posted them in comments under the reviews.\n\nIt told customer Daniel Bruckshaw after he complained: \u201cPlease don\u2019t pop in again or call either. We do not accept aggressive customers. Cancel our number. Thank you.\u201d\n\nMr Bruckshaw replied: \u201cAggressive?! Eh? I think you\u2019ve misunderstood my tone!
