Los Angeles (4-3) snapped a three-game losing streak, the team\u2019s longest under third-year coach Sean McVay, and Goff\u2019s versatile performance led the way.\n\n\u201cI think it was just the flow of that game and the way Sean wanted to call things,\u201d Goff said Wednesday. \u201cI do like it. It gets you some easy completions and gets the ball out on the edge to our skill players. It is a big part of our offense and it worked for us on Sunday.\u201d\n\nIt certainly helped that the Rams\u2019 37-10 blowout came against a Falcons unit that ranks at or near the bottom of most defensive categories. The Bengals (0-7) aren\u2019t much better, ranking worst in yards per game and eighth-worst in points allowed.\n\nThe Rams are practicing in Atlanta for a couple of days before flying to London, and Goff likes that the offense is using the time away from home to enhance the playbook.\n\nPassing game coordinator David Waldron said Goff was particularly effective on play-action keepers as he broke containment, got out on the edge of the defense and still had time to set his feet and follow through on his throws.\n\nThe Rams have always had such options in their playbook under McVay, but they were able to take advantage of them with the Falcons\u2019 lack of pass rush.\n\n\u201cI think the only difference is that the whole defense is kind of moving with you so that windows come open at different times,\u201d Goff said. \u201cIt\u2019s very similar to when you\u2019re in the pocket.\u201d\n\nBottled up the week before in an ugly home loss to San Francisco, Goff passed for 268 yards and a pair of touchdowns to running back Todd Gurley and tight end Gerald Everett. His fun-reel highlight, faking out linebacker Deion Jones, came on a 1-yard touchdown run. Goff spiked the ball for effect.\n\nThe Rams were an offensive juggernaut on their way to winning the NFC title last season. They\u2019re a bit off so far this season. Losing to the 49ers showed the unit at its worst. Goff passed for a career-low 78 yards, the running game struggled as Gurley missed the game with a thigh bruise and the line lost right guard Joe Noteboom to a season-ending injury.\n\nLos Angeles found the elixir in Atlanta.\n\n\u201cJared\u2019s athleticism is something we want to take advantage of, but that\u2019s kind of our core philosophy in terms of how we want to operate,\u201d McVay said. \u201cI thought you saw especially on that first drive, the one that ended up working the backside end cut to Cooper (Kupp), good movement in the pocket. They went to a three-man rush. Rob (Havenstein) did a great job of pancaking his guy, and Jared kind of felt where the rush was, moved around and really worked all the way through his progressions.\u201d\n\nGoff did some fine work in the pocket, too. His 13-yard TD pass to Gurley was a perfect read , and Goff lofted the ball into a perfect spot for Gurley to make an over-the-shoulder catch.\n\n\u201cI thought it was a great throw,\u201d McVay said. \u201cAt the time, he recognized the man coverage where (defensive end) Vic Beasley is peeling on him from an inside rush. To be able to just get that ball up and down long enough knowing that he can\u2019t leave it floating all day because Todd\u2019s going to end up running out of bounds and then there\u2019s a post safety coming up over the top.\n\n\u201cIt was great touch, great trajectory and it was really a great play by both those guys.\u201d\n\nNotes: LT Andrew Whitworth (rest), RB Malcolm Brown (ankle), LB Clay Matthews (jaw), LB Bryce Hager (shoulder) and CB Troy Hill (hamstring) did not practice in Wednesday\u2019s session at Georgia Tech.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jared Goff loved getting a chance to throw on the run last week and the two-time Pro Bowl year quarterback hopes it's a new trend for the Rams' offense.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "George Henry"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/23/rams_falcons_football_76715_c0-880-1919-1999_s1200x700.jpg?1f6944c52788a8f499bf5b684ee4609765936720", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
