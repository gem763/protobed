Some places haven\u2019t seen rain since May and some areas have seen temperatures over 100 Celsius since the end of July.\n\n\u2018There are 17 fires in total burning across California. This one here, the Kincade, is the biggest one. It has tripled in size since Sunday. It\u2019s bigger than the area of Birmingham and can be hundreds of miles from space.\n\nPiers has been in America as he takes a break from Good Morning Britain (Picture: Instagram)\n\nShe went on: \u2018It is down to a Santa Ana wind, a hot, dry wind that comes from the interior, 60mph gusts of winds mean it will spread very quickly.\n\n\u2018Conditions should improve by Thursday or Friday but for now it is looking pretty horrific, and unfortunately it\u2019s only going to get worse.\u2019\n\nLaura explained the \u2018hot, dry winds\u2019 were causing the fires to spread quickly (Picture: ITV)\n\nIn an Instagram post, Piers shared: \u2018Yikes. Rather discomforting msgs to wake up to.. the Getty museum is just 3 miles away.\n\n\u2018These fires are horrific, hard to explain to people back home how big and savage they get here in California, and how fast the changing winds can take them in completely different directions.\u2019\n\nAlong with his message was an image of a text alert advising people to \u2018prepare to evacuate\u2019.\n\nGood Morning Britain airs weekdays from 6am on ITV.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
