Public investors aren\u2019t going to tolerate gimmicks, like super-voting rights or complicated share structures, that privilege founders over other stakeholders, he said, adding they should get in shape years before they consider going public.\n\nThe \u201cor else\u201d part of the message became clear just days later when SoftBank led the ouster of WeWork\u2019s controversial co-founder Adam Neumann. The co-working giant\u2019s plans to go public this month imploded, with investors balking at paying a premium for a money-losing real estate venture controlled by an eccentric founder. More WeWork executives with close ties to Neumann quickly followed him out the door.\n\nThe messy, high-profile coup tarnishes Son\u2019s reputation for picking winners. But Neumann\u2019s removal also shows a new side of Son -- an investor willing enforce the kind of discipline that public investors demand at his portfolio companies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very public lesson for all the entrepreneurs,\u201d said Chris Lane, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. \u201cNo one will want to be Adam.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for SoftBank declined to comment on the private event. The three-day affair also featured a performance from singer John Legend, and a four-legged robot from portfolio company Boston Dynamics stalked across the hotel\u2019s lawn.\n\nSon, the smiling billionaire with a 300-year vision and a goal for his portfolio companies to create \u201cinformation revolution-happiness for everyone,\u201d has been considered founder-friendly for decades. In 1995, he wrote a $2 million check during his first meeting with Yahoo! co-founder Jerry Yang. Five years later, he invested $20 million in Jack Ma\u2019s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., a stake that\u2019s now worth more than $100 billion.\n\nThat was just a warm-up for his unprecedented $100 billion Vision Fund, raised in 2017. It\u2019s since put money into more than 80 companies in a dizzying array of sectors, from ride-hailing and genomics to vertical farms and satellites. In June, Son claimed his returns were 62% so far. But Silicon Valley venture capitalists were quick to cite WeWork as evidence of SoftBank\u2019s failures.\n\n\u201cWelcoming all the converts to the SoftBank is horrible position,\u201d wrote one VC on Twitter.\n\nNow, SoftBank will have to decide whether to write down the value of its stake. The We Co. IPO has been delayed for now, but when it does occur, the market may value the company at about a third of its valuation when Son last put money into it.\n\nNeumann didn\u2019t make it to Pasadena last week, according to the person. But as the festivities wound down on Thursday, WeWork\u2019s board and its institutional investors including SoftBank arrived at a consensus: WeWork IPO could not proceed with Neumann at the helm. It took another three days for long-time SoftBank directors Ron Fisher and Mark Schwartz to get WeWork\u2019s co-founder to come around. On Tuesday, he stepped down from his CEO role, taking the title of non-executive chairman.\n\nSoftBank\u2019s strategy of taking non-controlling stakes in the world\u2019s leading tech companies and encouraging them to cooperate means that Son doesn\u2019t have direct influence on how they are run. But the massive infusions of cash, ranging from about $100 million into the billions of dollars, come with accelerated growth schedules and an increased need for cash.\n\n\u201cIf you are dependent on someone to provide the funding, it doesn\u2019t matter how much they own,\u201d Bernstein\u2019s Lane said. \u201cIn the case of WeWork, the public markets clearly weren\u2019t willing to step in. Their only viable option was the Vision Fund.\u201d\n\nWeWork isn\u2019t SoftBank\u2019s first intervention. Its investment in Uber Technologies Inc. included a deal to block controversial co-founder Travis Kalanick from taking a CEO or chairman position.\n\nMore recently, Brandless Inc. CEO Tina Sharkey stepped down in March in a move that\u2019s been attributed to growing tension with its shareholder. SoftBank had agreed to invest $240 million in installments in the maker of unbranded goods last year. Tensions had arisen when SoftBank began pressuring the company to turn a profit, according to news site The Information, which cited people with knowledge of the discussions who it didn\u2019t name.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Masayoshi Son, long known as a free-spending benefactor who encouraged startup founders to pursue their dreams even if it meant losing billions of dollars, had a different message for entrepreneurs last week: Your dreams had better be profitable.The chief executive officer of Japan\u2019s SoftBank", "authors": ["Pavel Alpeyev"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kYUroqBhh3HbIlsewN680Q--~B/aD0yNjY3O3c9NDAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_technology_68/7c20e6fe9deb4da068066c8df1713e27", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
