Liars can seem honest, spies can seem loyal, nervous people can seem guilty. People\u2019s facial expressions are not a reliable guide to what they are thinking. Or, to put it in Hamlet\u2019s words, one may smile, and smile, and be a villain. Makes you think, doesn\u2019t it?\n\nIf any of this is surprising to you, then you are in exalted company, because it also surprises Malcolm Gladwell, whose job it is to be puzzled by banalities and then replace them, after a great pseudo-intellectual circumambulation, with banalities. Gladwell affects to find it baffling how we can get people we don\u2019t know so wrong. So he calls it \u201cthe stranger problem\u201d, and pretends that it explains everything.\n\nIt explains, for example, the fate of a young black woman named Sandra Bland. Gladwell introduces her by remarking that she was \u201ctall and striking, with a personality to match\u201d, which is just the kind of deft pen-portrait that has earned him a reputation as a brilliant writer for the best magazines. In Texas in 2015, Bland was pulled over for a traffic infraction by a cop named Brian Encinia. The encounter rapidly degenerated as the hostile and suspicious state trooper forced her out of the car, called for backup, and had her arrested. Days later Bland was found dead in her cell.\n\nYou will guess that there is a counterintuitive take coming: Gladwell wants us to feel sorry for the cop. \u201cThink about how hard it was\u201d for him, he pleads. \u201cSandra Bland was not someone Brian Encinia knew from the neighborhood or down the street ... They were strangers to each other.\u201d Other policemen stop strangers all the time without bullying them and hauling them in, but never mind that now. Encinia, as Gladwell credulously interprets his subsequent statements, was \u201cterrified\u201d of this young woman, who might after all have been planning to burn him with her cigarette. It\u2019s very difficult, don\u2019t you see, not to be a brute.\n\nWhat else is it difficult not to be? In Gladwell\u2019s world of large ideas, it may also be hard not to be a rapist when you\u2019re drunk. He brings his forensic empathy to the case of Brock Turner, the Stanford college student who was caught sexually assaulting an unconscious woman on the ground outside a dorm building. Such a difficult case! Gladwell explains sorrowfully that consuming large amounts of alcohol causes mental \u201cmyopia\u201d, where one is unable to consider the long-term consequences of one\u2019s actions. It\u2019s just too bad, he concludes, that these careless students both got so drunk at a party that the man could \u201ctragically misunderstand\u201d the woman\u2019s intentions. You may object that plenty of men are able to get blattered without raping anyone, but that seems to be beyond Malcolm Gladwell.\n\nTo be sure, this book is not exclusively about standing up for the unlucky men who accidentally do bad things just because the \u201cstranger problem\u201d is so lamentably intractable. It is also littered with historical and pop-cultural anecdotes. Why did Chamberlain think Hitler sincerely wanted peace? Such a \u201cpuzzle\u201d leads us through stories about Cuban espionage, predatory paedophiles, the Bernie Madoff fraud, Sylvia Plath\u2019s suicide, the interrogation of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, and the TV show Friends. \u201cMaybe real life isn\u2019t like Friends,\u201d Gladwell suggests, momentously.\n\nGladwell bases his book on a single notion called \u201ctruth-default theory\u201d. We tend to assume that other people are telling the truth, which is the basis of trust and social cooperation, so liars are hard to spot. Not mentioned here is the well-known opposite phenomenon: that, far from defaulting to truth, we believe only the information that fits with our preconceived biases. Both ideas are right, because the world is complicated, but Gladwell\u2019s job is to make it seem simple.\n\nAnother teachable story here is that of Amanda Knox, the American student in Perugia who was imprisoned for murder (and later acquitted) because her behaviour after the crime seemed extremely odd. Gladwell assures us that weird behaviour is not reliable evidence of guilt. There is a psychological phenomenon called \u201cthe illusion of asymmetric insight\u201d: we consider ourselves opaque to others, while thinking that other people are easy to read correctly. \u201cIf I can convince you of one thing in this book,\u201d he announces dramatically, \u201clet it be this: Strangers are not easy.\u201d\n\nPerhaps if we can all become convinced of this novel truth, we will stop harassing and raping one another for good. If only someone like Shakespeare had encoded the lesson centuries ago in some memorable form, like, I don\u2019t know, \u201cThere\u2019s no art / To find the mind\u2019s construction in the face.\u201d In the absence of such poetic conventional wisdom, though, another book by Gladwell just might save the world.\n\n\u2022 Talking to Strangers: What We Should Know about the People We Don\u2019t Know is published by Allen Lane (\u00a330).
