Her companies were also awarded \u00a3126,000 of public money.\n\nAccording to the latest revelation, Johnson was listed as a reference on Arcuri\u2019s application for a role at Tech City, which was launched by David Cameron to bolster digital companies in east London.\n\nThe Sunday Times said Arcuri was a 27-year-old student when she applied for the \u00a3100,000 a year job in 2012.\n\nIn an email leaked to the newspaper, she allegedly later wrote: \u201cI still have the letter of rec from Boris. hahaha. To think that we asked him to write us a recommendation for the CEO of Tech City is just hysterical.\u201d\n\nArcuri did not get the job, which went to Joanna Shields, a former head of Facebook in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.\n\nJohnson and Arcuri have both refused to deny they had an affair but the technology entrepreneur has said the stories being written about her are false, without being more specific.\n\nOn Monday, she will give her first television interview since the row erupted by appearing on ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain, according to the show\u2019s co-presenter, Piers Morgan.\n\nOn Thursday, a US lawyer claiming to act on behalf of Arcuri said he was inviting media outlets, including British publications, to bid six-figure sums for an interview with her.\n\nCalifornia-based Michael Walsh said five outlets were in the running for an interview with $225,000 (\u00a3202,000) the highest bid at that time.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg on Friday, Arcuri said: \u201cI will not be the person to bring Boris Johnson down. I refuse to be a pawn.\u201d\n\nShe said she was within her rights to go on the trade missions and apply for the grants received by her companies, insisting \u201cmy relationship with Boris is nobody\u2019s business\u201d.\n\nSeveral inquiries have been opened since the allegations emerged. The Greater London Authority has asked the Independent Office for Police Conduct to assess whether Johnson, as a former police commissioner, should face a criminal investigation for misconduct in public office.\n\nThe prime minister has until Tuesday to respond to a summons from the London assembly to provide details of his relationship with Arcuri.", "description": "Then London mayor was also allegedly listed as a reference on application for \u00a3100k role", "authors": ["Haroon Siddique", "John Crace"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc2ad474f0649fba326cca04c0cd3804939b45b9/410_68_829_498/master/829.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=aed504dbca41ebdddf08bb19fe9c3043", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
