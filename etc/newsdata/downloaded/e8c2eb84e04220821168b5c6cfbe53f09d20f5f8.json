The airline is offering captains and first officers a pay increase worth 11.5 per cent over three years, which it describes as \u201cvery fair\u201d.\n\nThe British Airline Pilots\u2019 Association (Balpa) does not think it is good enough, in view of the contribution they make to the airline\u2019s immense profitability. The general secretary, Brian Strutton, told me: \u201cIf the public understood the financial sacrifices that pilots made in BA\u2019s lean years, including pay cuts and loss of terms and conditions, they might recognise that the gap between us, of less than 0.5 per cent of BA\u2019s profit, is not unreasonable.\u201d\n\nThree out of four of the pilots based at Heathrow and Gatwick voted to strike. BA made two legal attempts to have the ballot ruled unlawful, but when they failed the airline prepared for a stoppage.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nManagers worked out how many flights might be able to operate with non-striking pilots. Deals for \u201cwet-leased\u201d planes (hired complete with crew) from other airlines were set up. And BA leaned on partner airlines to use bigger planes to help carry more of its passengers.\n\nBA also prepared the message it would send out to passengers whose flights were grounded.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The European air passengers\u2019 rights rules have been on the statute for 15 years and are perfectly clear about BA\u2019s obligations.\n\nIn the admittedly unlikely event that I had been asked to draft the email, it would go like this: \u201cYour flight has been cancelled, but don\u2019t worry: we are doing all we can to minimise the inconvenience for you.\n\n\u201cYou can have a full refund or take a later British Airways flight (in which case we\u2019ll book and pay for a hotel for you). But we recognise that what you probably need is a flight on a different airline as close to the original departure time as possible.\n\n\u201cSo we will secure you a seat on the best available alternative flight, which for the vast majority of passengers will be on the same day.\u201d\n\nLast Friday, Balpa announced a series of September strikes. The timing was calculated to cause maximum embarrassment to BA on the eve of its 100th birthday weekend, and the walk-outs on 9, 10 and 27 September are intended to cause maximum trauma for its passengers.\n\nBA called the action \u201cunjustifiable\u201d and said: \u201cIt is completely unacceptable that Balpa is destroying the travel plans of tens of thousands of our customers.\u201d\n\nIn fact, I calculate the walk-outs will affect far more people than that: up to half a million travellers, not just on the strike dates, but on several days on either side because of the complexities of rosters.\n\nBritish Airways brought in extra staff for its call centre and social media teams, pressed the big button marked \u201cstrike emails\u201d and dispatched cancellation messages by the gigabyte \u2013 unfortunately, as it turned out, adding in many thousands of passengers whose flights had not been grounded.\n\nThat should not have mattered. With the basic upfront message, \u201cRelax, we\u2019ll sort out an alternative flight for you,\u201d no one would have felt it necessary to spend three hours on hold to the call centre.\n\nExcept that the BA email neglected to mention the option of a flight on a rival airline, instead merely offering a choice between a refund and rebooking.\n\nOver the weekend I lobbied the airline to make clear its obligation to use other airlines. Eventually, on Tuesday, an online change was made. But then it turned out that BA would not book seats on the three big budget airlines serving the UK: easyJet, Jet2 and Ryanair.\n\nAs thousands of easyJet passengers will testify, after their flights this summer were abruptly cancelled and they were abandoned at the airport, other airlines avoid their obligations under European air passengers\u2019 rights rules now and again. But BA takes the practice to a new level.\n\nIs British Airways wisely doing what it can to minimise the impact of a strike intended to cause severe financial damage, or displaying corporate arrogance by ignoring the long-established rules on passenger care?\n\nThe traveller will decide.", "description": "British Airways pilots want more money.
