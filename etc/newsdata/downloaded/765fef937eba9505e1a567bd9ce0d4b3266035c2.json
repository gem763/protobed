Michael\u2019s nephews Taryll, TJ and Taj Jackson also stopped by the bash but it would have been hard to spot them as they were dressed in frightful Halloween costumes.\n\nPrince, 22, recalled fond memories of their childhood where Michael, who died in 2009, would allow them to do fancy dress together on Halloween.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018A lot of people know that my dad liked to have our faces covered to protect our identity and as the most famous man in the world, it [was] very hard for him to get out and do normal things,\u2019 he recalled to the Associated Press at the party.\n\n\u2018But because it\u2019s acceptable in Halloween to dress up in full costume, that was one of the only times when we could hang out outside as a family.\u2019\n\nPrince continued: \u2018We would always dress up as superheroes and the one I always remember was Spider-Man, It would be very simple, one piece, velcro on the back and a pull over mask. I always remember the smell of my own saliva in there, it was kind of nasty.\n\nPrince took over the Jackson estate to host the event (Picture: Rex Features)\n\nPrince was joined by his cousins Taj and TJ (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nPrince opted not to get into costume this year (Picture: Getty Images)\n\n\u2018It was always fun because no one knows who you were and you could grab candy, it\u2019s a really fun experience.\u2019\n\nTJ also said: \u2018It\u2019s funny though because he would do that [dress up in costume] but he has such a unique walk that you could tell it was someone different\u2026 but for us, watching him walk, it was such a Michael Jackson walk but no one knows.\u2019\n\nWhile Taj added: \u2018Or he would be in his loafers and white socks. He\u2019d be dressed up but his shoes would give him away.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing the event, Paris, 21, shared a heartfelt message praising her older brother for taking the reigns and organising the charity night.\n\nIn an Instagram post, she wrote: \u2018I\u2019m sooooo proud of you big brother @princejackson. i know i say it all the f***in\u2019 time but your way with words, the grace, eloquence, and composure is out of this world and always blows me away.\n\n\u2018You\u2019ve got such a great head on your shoulders and are doing some really f***ing amazing things. you\u2019ve always been my idol and role model and even more so as each day goes on. i love you with all of my heart. happy halloween everyone!! xxo -radagast and gandalf [sic].\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
