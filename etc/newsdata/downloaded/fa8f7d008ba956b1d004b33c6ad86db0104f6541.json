REUTERS/Jason Lee/Illustration/File Photo\n\nSuch a deal would, however, provide the U.S. Treasury an opportunity to climb down from what currency experts say was a misguided declaration in August that Beijing was a \u201ccurrency manipulator,\u201d reducing the yuan\u2019s value to gain \u201cunfair competitive advantage in international trade.\u201d\n\nLittle is known about the structure of a currency deal that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said American and Chinese negotiators were working toward on Thursday in their first high-level trade talks since July, but it is widely expected to include a promise from both to sides to refrain from devaluing their currencies to gain a competitive trade advantage.\n\nAs members of the Group of 20 major economies, both the United States and China agreed to such language starting in 2010.\n\nAt that time, China was widely seen to be deliberately holding down the value of its heavily managed currency, also known as the renminbi (RMB). But this intervention shifted to mainly prop up the yuan\u2019s value after a sharp devaluation in 2015.\n\nIt is unclear how a pact with the United States might change Beijing\u2019s behavior.\n\n\u201cIn essence, I don\u2019t see anything in a currency deal that will cause a significant change in the present RMB/dollar currency market dynamics,\u201d said Mark Sobel, a longtime former Treasury and International Monetary Fund official who is now U.S. chairman of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, a London-based think tank.\n\nMyron Brilliant, head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said a currency deal would likely be accompanied by the United States\u2019 canceling a planned tariff increase to 30% from 25% on $250 billion in Chinese imports.\n\nA U.S. official confirmed that currency would likely be discussed in the talks, but it was premature to say whether an announcement would be made on the issue this week. Optimism over the talks had improved after the first day\u2019s negotiations wrapped up.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, a principal negotiator in the talks along with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, said as early as February that Chinese Vice Premier Liu He had largely agreed to currency language. But talks on a broader deal to end the trade war between the United States and China broke down in May, leaving the currency provisions in limbo.\n\nYUAN STABILITY\n\nMnuchin has long pushed his Chinese counterparts for increased transparency in yuan market interventions by China\u2019s central bank and to maintain a stable yuan value against the dollar.\n\nIn August, after the yuan fell below the psychologically important level of 7 to the dollar in response to a new round of U.S. tariffs, the Treasury Department declared China a currency manipulator for the first time in 25 years following Trump\u2019s own tweets that China was manipulating the yuan.\n\nThe designation under a 1988 law requires the Treasury to enter into negotiations with the offending country to correct the situation \u2014 an effort that had been under way for more than two years.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund disagreed with the designation, arguing that the yuan\u2019s value was in line with China\u2019s trade-battered fundamentals. Beijing had actually been spending reserves to prop up the yuan\u2019s value, not push it down to make exports cheaper.\n\nEswar Prasad, former head of the IMF\u2019s China department and now a trade professor at Cornell University, said it would be convenient time for both sides to agree on the need for maintaining a stable dollar/yuan value \u2014 even though this goes against longstanding U.S. demands that China allow its currency to float freely.\n\nIf so, the United States would get an assurance that yuan devaluation would not undermine its tariffs, while China would reduce the risk of capital outflows from perceptions that it is trying to weaken the yuan, he said.\n\n\u201cThis issue could give both sides cover to strike a mini deal that has little substance but de-escalates tensions at least temporarily, which could stabilize market sentiment and have some positive effects on both economies,\u201d Prasad said.\n\nCURRENCY REPORT\n\nAn agreement could also allow the Treasury to declare that its manipulator designation on Beijing had been resolved. The Treasury will need to address the designation in its semi-annual currency report, due on Tuesday.\n\nMnuchin has said that currency provisions in the new U.S.-Mexico Canada Agreement represent a model for future trade deals, although these were not repeated in a newly signed limited trade deal with Japan.\n\nThe USMCA language closely tracks the G20 language. The North American trade deal, which still needs ratification by the U.S. Congress, requires the three countries to disclose monthly data on international reserve balances and intervention in foreign exchange markets, along with quarterly balance-of-payments data and other public reporting to the IMF.\n\n\u201cIf China publishes intervention data and is more transparent about its currency practices, that\u2019s a positive,\u201d said Sobel of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, although he noted that China already publishes reserves data, which show that it has not intervened to prevent the yuan from rising for years.", "description": "A U.S.-China currency agreement being floated as a symbol of progress in this week's trade talks between the world's two largest economies would largely repeat past pledges by China, currency experts say, and will not change the dollar-yuan relationship that has been a thorn in the side of President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["David Lawder", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439566791&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A0CZ", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
