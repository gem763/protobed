Australia\u2019s rich are distinguished from the US and Europe for their lack of aristocrats, old-time monopolists and robber barons. Their number includes the most extraordinary rags-to-riches Australian immigrant success stories.\n\nThe big trend in this year's list of Australia\u2019s 200 wealthiest people \u2013 which required a minimum fortune of $472 million to qualify \u2013 has been the continued rise of tech entrepreneurs, up to 14 from 10 last year. These new entrepreneurs have harnessed the internet to overcome the traditional tyranny of distance to build global markets, quickly. These are companies such as Mike Cannon-Brookes\u2019 and Scott Farquhar\u2019s Atlassian, Richard White\u2019s WiseTech and Sweat, the global fitness app created by personal trainers Tobias Pearce and Kayla Itsines in Adelaide. The Atlassian founders are from middle-class families and started their company on a credit card. Now they own the two old Fairfax family mansions, purchased in the year that Fairfax ceased to exist as a standalone company.\n\nThe top one and two on the list, Anthony Pratt and Gina Rinehart, have used their inherited wealth to build even bigger companies, massively increasing their wealth while creating jobs and prosperity for many others. According to Mr Pratt, Pratt Industries and Visy have been spurred along by the Donald Trump tax cuts and instant expensing of new investment. Pratt Industries is creating new employment across the Trump-voting American midwest. Gina Rinehart could have lived her life as a royalties heiress: instead she built her own massive Roy Hill Mine in the Pilbara.\n\nThe Trump stimulus injected into the global economy has been one notable driver of global international growth. But an iron ore price that jumped to $US108 a tonne this week shows how important China's blast furnaces remain to Australian prosperity, including iron ore entrepreneurs Ms Rinehart and Andrew Forrest. Yet the names that fell off this year\u2019s Rich List also show the risks present in a China opaque markets, politics and regulatory regimes. Marcus Blackmore, Jane Cameron and Bruce Neill \u2013 all with big exposures to China\u2019s consumer markets that use grey channels and daigou shoppers to get their goods into China \u2013 fell off the list, highlighting the risks associated with having many eggs in one basket.", "description": "Australia\u2019s rich are distinguished from the US and Europe for their lack of aristocrats, old-time monopolists and robber barons.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_2339%2C$y_1518/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/3b673aa9ed7830fbcf800085f250f8842b80abe5", "published_at": "2019-05-30"}
