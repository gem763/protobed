Of course, it is worth noting these are representative APRs, which means as little as 51 per cent of applicants may get that rate.\n\nAmex also recently wrote to customers to tell them that from October it will be partially linking the interest rates on its credit cards to the Bank of England base rate.\n\nAccording to the latest figures from UK Finance, in June this year \u00a366.5billion in balances remained outstanding on UK credit cards. \u00a315.6billion was spent on credit cards in June in 271million transactions.\n\nAlastair Douglas, the chief executive of credit comparison site TotallyMoney, said: 'The results highlight that some of the biggest providers are removing their most competitive products from the market. At the same time, the average credit card APR is steadily increasing.\n\n'The combination of these trends means some consumers might struggle with the higher cost of borrowing. And, repaying debts could become increasingly difficult.\n\n'Even if you're unable to pay your balance in full each month, you should try and stick to a fixed, monthly payment plan.\n\nWherever possible, pay more than the minimum amount each month. This can make a huge difference and save you money in added interest charges.\n\n'If you're worried about offers being taken away, don't make panic credit card applications. Instead, check your eligibility for a variety of cards to find the best one for you.'\n\nHowever, Springall noted that while these changes were a blow for spenders, there is a suggestion UK consumers are taking action to protect themselves from rising fees.\n\n'The latest data from UK Finance shows a decline in the proportion of credit card balances that bear interest, now 53.4 per cent in June 2019 down from 54.6 per cent in the same month last year.'\n\nWhat's more, the annual rate by which outstanding balances are increasing fell to 3.6 per cent in June, down from 8.3 per cent at the start of 2018.\n\nIt suggests that while 0 per cent balance transfer deals are getting shorter, more consumers are taking advantage of them.\n\nBalance transfer cards allow you to shuffle debt onto one card, in exchange for a fee.\n\nThe credit card debt will then accumulate zero interest for a defined period, but make sure you pay it off during that time or else you will once again be charged interest.\n\nAccording to This is Money's guide to the best balance transfer deals, the longest deal currently available is offered by Virgin Money, which charges a 3 per cent fee and has a 0 per cent interest term of 29 months.\n\nTransfers must be made within the first 60 days or a 5 per cent fee also applies.\n\nMeanwhile, if you are confident you can pay off your debt in a shorter time frame, some cards offer no transfer fees.
