But discord and walkouts stymied debate and left the assembly deserted.\n\n\u201cThe beginning of a new era for Northern Ireland \u2013 one in which we\u2019re free from oppressive laws that have policed our bodies and healthcare,\u201d said Grainne Teggart, Amnesty International\u2019s Northern Ireland campaign manager.\n\n\u201cThank you to everyone who has told their stories to help us reach this milestone,\u201d tweeted Love Equality NI, an umbrella group that campaigned for marriage equality. \u201cA historic moment,\u201d said the advocacy group Stonewall.\n\nLove Equality NI (@Love_EqualityNI) We\u2019re so proud to be surrounded by some of the people, couples and campaigners who have brought us to this point.\n\n\n\nThank you to everyone who has told their stories to help us reach this milestone. \u2665\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/51F875nNHm\n\nThe new legislation puts the House of Commons on track to legislate for marriage equality by January 2020, paving the way for same-sex couples to wed from 14 February \u2013 Valentine\u2019s Day.\n\nThe abortion law obliges the UK to ensure regulations for free, legal and local abortion services are in place by 31 March 2020.\n\nAfter midnight there will be a moratorium on criminal prosecutions, halting police investigations into abortion cases, including a case against a mother who faced jail for buying her then 15-year-old daughter abortion pills online, said Amnesty.\n\n\u201cIn 2014 when I needed an abortion and was denied one I swore I would add my voice to the campaign for abortion rights and to have achieved that is just incredible,\u201d said Ashleigh Topley, who was part of a supreme court challenge to the ban.\n\nThe DUP leader, Arlene Foster, in contrast, lamented a \u201cshameful\u201d day and said her party would examine ways to repeal the legislation. \u201cWe will do everything in our conscience to protect the lives of the unborn,\u201d she said.\n\nNorthern Ireland had retained a Victorian-era ban on same sex marriage and a near-blanket ban on abortion due to the power of the DUP and other religious and social conservatives.\n\nThe Conservative government, reliant on DUP votes in Westminster, declined to intervene, saying both issues were for devolved government. However a dispute between the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in toppled the power-sharing assembly and executive at Stormont in January 2017, leaving a vacuum.\n\nQuick guide Same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland Show Hide The path to equality When England and Wales enshrined marriage equality in 2013, Northern Ireland\u2019s social conservatives, led by the DUP, campaigned to keep the region apart. Their view reflected the beliefs of the party\u2019s late founder Ian Paisley, who led a \u2018save Ulster from sodomy\u2019 campaign in the 1970s. Opinion polls showed most people favoured liberalisation, and a majority at Stormont voted in favour, but the DUP used a special veto. Under legislation passed by Westminster with the Stormont assembly not sitting, same-sex marriage will become legal in Northern Ireland in January. Once couples give the required 28 days\u2019 notice they will be free to marry \u2013 starting the week of Valentine\u2019s Day 2020.\n\nCampaigners broke the stalemate in July when two Labour MPs, Stella Creasy and Conor McGinn, tabled amendments on abortion and same-sex marriage to an otherwise technical government bill connected to the defunct assembly. MPs voted overwhelmingly for both.\n\nMonday was the last chance for opponents of change to restore Stormont and avert the legislation.\n\nSome 31 members of the legislative assembly (MLAs) signed a petition to force a recall to discuss a motion to put abortion rights back in the hands of local politicians.\n\nSinn F\u00e9in and the Alliance party said they would not attend, calling the event a stunt, leaving Monday\u2019s gathering largely symbolic and devoid of the power to elect a new speaker and form an executive.\n\nQ&A What is the law on abortion in Northern Ireland? Show Hide The 1967 Abortion Act which liberalised the law in England, Scotland and Wales never extended to Northern Ireland. The region permitted abortion only if a woman\u2019s life was at risk or if there was a risk of permanent and serious damage to her mental or physical health. The story of Sarah Ewart, who travelled to England for an abortion after being told her baby would not survive outside the womb, galvanised change. The legislation brought in by Westminster, which takes effect on Tuesday, decriminalises abortion. After consultations, the UK government will have to put in place regulations for abortion services by next April; until then, women will be offered free transport and accommodation to access abortion services in England. In England, Scotland and Wales, the limit on abortions except in cases of fatal foetal abnormality or risk to life is 24 weeks. But anti-abortion campaigners in Northern Ireland claim that the change could mean abortion up to 28 weeks.\n\nThe recall degenerated into debacle when MLAs clashed with each other and the outgoing speaker, Robin Newton, over procedure. Newton said electing a new speaker required cross-party support. The only nationalist party present, the SDLP, withheld support.\n\nOne by one members of the DUP, the Ulster Unionists (UUP), SDLP and other parties walked out. By the time the Speaker called a vote on adjournment the chamber was empty.\n\nSinn F\u00e9in\u2019s deputy leader, Michelle O\u2019Neill, said the attempted recall further battered public confidence in the defunct assembly. The UUP leader, Robin Swann, questioned whether Stormont institutions were worth saving.", "description": "Equality campaigners were celebrating before the midnight deadline for law to take effect", "authors": ["Rory Carroll"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8eaad0202a7b44beba51dc7c5ea71fe69007a521/0_194_5302_3182/master/5302.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cfcf4ca156c401bdf53c62287b49c9a6", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
