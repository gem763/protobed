Monica Rochester said during a press conference. Five crew members were awake on the deck of the dive boat and jumped from the fire, Capt. Rochester said.\n\nCoast Guard Petty Officer Mark Barney said four bodies had been recovered by 11 a.m. and said officials are working to notify the families of victims.\n\nThe Coast Guard was using helicopters and ships to search for an additional 30 passengers, who were sleeping below deck at the time the fire broke out, Capt. Rochester said. The Coast Guard responded to the vessel along with police and fire personnel from Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, Capt. Rochester said.\n\nSanta Barbara County Fire Department spokesman Mike Eliason said the Conception was anchored along the north side of Santa Cruz Island, part of Channel Islands National Park. The vessel was adrift and burned down to the water line when fire officials arrived, Mr. Eliason said. Capt. Rochester said only part of its bow remained above water, about 20 yards offshore.\n\n\u201cWe are currently still in the response phase,\u201d Capt. Rochester said. A team from the National Transportation Safety Board is heading to California to investigate the incident, the NTSB said on Twitter .\n\nThe Conception was in the middle of a chartered three-day diving excursion led by Kristy Finstad of Worldwide Diving Adventures, according to a posting on that company\u2019s website and Brett Harmeling, Ms. Finstad\u2019s brother.\n\nMr. Harmeling, reached by phone, said his sister was among the people missing. She has been diving for more than 30 years, he said.\n\nAn employee of Truth Aquatics, which owns the ship, declined to comment when reached by phone. Company owner Glen Fritzler didn\u2019t return an email seeking comment. Capt. Rochester said the Conception was in \u201cfull compliance\u201d at the time of the fire.\n\nAccording to specifications posted online, the vessel was launched in 1981 and had 46 bunks. Passengers sleep below the deck, according to schematics.\n\nThe boat was a fixture for divers in Southern California\u2014the actor Rob Lowe said on Twitter that he had dived from the ship\u2014and that the loss of the boat had already hit the local diving community hard, said Andy Taylor, owner of the Blue Water Hunter, a scuba shop in Santa Barbara.\n\nMr. Taylor called the fire on the ship a \u201chuge loss.\u201d\n\nThe crew members were rescued by a private boat called \u201cThe Grape Escape,\u201d Capt. Rochester said. At least one crew member was treated for minor injuries, the Coast Guard said in a tweet.\n\nAccording to a report released last month by the Coast Guard, 633 people died in recreational boating accidents in 2018. In July of that year, 17 people died when the duck boat in which they were riding sank on Table Rock Lake near Branson, Missouri. Twenty-one people were killed when a cruise ship sank on Lake George in New York in 2005.\n\nWrite to Jimmy Vielkind at Jimmy.Vielkind@wsj.com", "description": "Rescuers have recovered four bodies and are searching for 30 other passengers from a dive boat that caught fire and sank Monday morning off Santa Cruz Island, officials said.", "authors": ["Jimmy Vielkind", "Jimmy.Vielkind Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103297/social"}
