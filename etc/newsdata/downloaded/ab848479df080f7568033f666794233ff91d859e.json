Put another way, a black woman would have to work until age 86 just to make the same amount of money a white man earned by age 60, the organization said.\n\nA black woman would have to work until age 86 just to make the same amount of money a white man earned by age 60, new research concludes.\n\nBlack women in high-paying careers are also underpaid, the National Women\u2019s Law Center said, citing U.S. Census Bureau data. Black women who work full time, year-round in these occupations \u2014 lawyers, engineers, and physicians or surgeons are paid about $70,000, compared to the $105,000 paid to white, non-Hispanic men in these same jobs. This amounts to an annual loss of $35,000 each year, or $1.4 million over a 40-year career.\n\nThe data didn\u2019t break out the lifetime loss in earnings for Latina women but, assuming the same methodology as that applying to black women, that would likely far exceed $1 million. While black women earned 61 cents on the dollar, white women earned 77 cents and Latina women earned 53 cents for every dollar a white man makes, the study added.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics also paint a troubling picture. Black women were the only demographic group to see their median weekly earnings decline from 2017 to 2018, according to the agency\u2019s figures. Their median earnings decreased from $657 to $654, the agency said. Latina women had the lowest median earnings, but they rose from $603 to $617.\n\nWhite men have paid off 44% of their student debt 12 years after graduation, but black women end up owing 13% more in that same time.\n\nOther studies have estimated the wage gap\u2019s ultimate cost and put a lower \u2014 yet still large \u2014 price tag. Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine researchers analyzed internal pay disparities and said a woman hired in 2005 and making 2.6% less than her male counterpart stood to lose $501,416 in salary and investment returns during 30 years.\n\nThe study didn\u2019t delve into racial disparities. But being a place of higher learning and advanced degrees, the Johns Hopkins University research is a reminder of another hurdle black women face.\n\nBlack women graduate college with the most student-loan debt, according to the American Association of University Women. They also incur an average $30,366 in student-loan debt, which is almost $9,000 more than the average $21,619 student-loan debt all women have, the organization said.\n\nOne argument against the pay gap\u2019s existence is that women simply need more skills and degrees to earn more. But some economists say the pay gap remains stubbornly in place regardless of educational degree.
