It means the world to me, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to appreciate it until after the season.\u201d\n\nAmed Rosario hit a two-run homer and Jeff McNeil added a solo shot for the Mets, who remained 3 1/2 games behind Milwaukee for the second NL wild card after the Brewers beat the Pirates 10-1.\n\nAlonso is two homers shy of Yankees star Aaron Judge\u2019s 2017 total for the rookie record. The right-handed hitter connected on a two-run blast in the eighth inning against reliever Sal Romano, reaching for a down-and-away fastball and lining it an estimated 437 feet to the faux riverboat smokestacks in right-center field.\n\n\u201cThe catcher reached down and to the right and he reached out and flicked it to the steam towers,\u201d New York manager Mickey Callaway said. \u201cIt was a well-executed pitch. I don\u2019t know what you do if you\u2019re a pitcher. (Former Red) Todd Frazier said he\u2019s never seen a left-hander hit one there.\u201d\n\nAlonso is the second rookie to reach 50 homers, and he leads Cincinnati\u2019s Eugenio Suarez by two for most in the majors.\n\nThe Reds intentionally walked Alonso during New York\u2019s three-run ninth.\n\nCincinnati rookie Aristides Aquino led off the ninth with a homer. The midseason call-up has 17 home runs in 49 games this season.\n\nDeGrom (10-8) struck out nine and didn\u2019t walk anybody to match his win total from last season, when he won the NL Cy Young Award. He could be a repeat winner after dropping his ERA to 2.51.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been able to locate all my pitches and throw them when I want,\u201d deGrom said. \u201cHaving the feel of my curve and changeup and moving the fastball in and our helps keep them off balance.\n\nMcNeil broke up the scoreless tie with his 23rd homer, a towering drive into the visitors\u2019 bullpen down the right field line with one out in the sixth inning.\n\nRosario followed J.D. Davis\u2019s two-out walk with a two-run shot to left-center field, his 14th homer.\n\nThose were two of the three hits allowed by Luis Castillo in seven innings. Castillo (15-7) struck out seven and walked three.\n\n\u201cWe got to see first-hand why deGrom is so good,\u201d Reds manager David Bell said .\u201dI saw really sharp stuff. He had it all going. I saw the same thing with Castillo. He was really good. You can\u2019t do much better than that. You\u2019d like to have those two pitches back, but he was really good.\u201d\n\nSEVENS ARE WILD\n\nThe start was deGrom\u2019s seventh straight and 11th in his last 12 in which he logged exactly seven innings.\n\nMINGLING\n\nMarty Brennaman, retiring this year after 46 seasons as a Reds broadcaster, and partner Jeff Brantley broadcast the game from a special booth built near a section of lower-level seats.\n\nLORENZEN\u2019S CLEMENTE\n\nReds pitcher Michael Lorenzen was honored before the game as the Reds nominee for the Roberto Clemente Award. Lorenzen, who also plays outfield, wears No. 21 in honor of Clemente.\n\nMOVING UP\n\nCastillo\u2019s seven strikeouts boosted his season total to 218, good for a tie with Aaron Harag in 2007 for ninth on the franchise\u2019s single-season strikeout list. Tom Seaver is eighth with 226 in 1978.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nMets: RHP Robert Gsellman\u2019s bullpen session went \u201cextremely well,\u201d Callaway said. A Saturday evaluation will determine whether the next step is pitching live batting practice. Gsellman has been out since August 14 with right triceps tightness.\n\nReds: Manager David Bell considers the return of OF Jesse Winker (cervical strain) this season \u201chighly unlikely.\u201d Winker has been sidelined since August 22.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMets: RHP Zack Wheeler (11-7) is 5-1 with a 2.93 ERA over his last 10 starts. New York is 7-3 in those games.\n\nReds: RHP Anthony DeSclafani (9-9) is 0-3 with a 6.75 ERA in four career starts against the Mets.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Pete Alonso felt going into the season that reaching 50 home runs was possible.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/20/mets_reds_baseball_40020_c0-180-4302-2688_s1770x1032.jpg?4dddf05cff45dca76343df699e08fcff78895688", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
