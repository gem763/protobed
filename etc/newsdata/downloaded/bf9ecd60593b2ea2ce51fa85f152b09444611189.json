The same day the UK is now supposed to leave the European Union \u2013 31 January.\n\nThe film, which director Nicolas denies is a reboot, stars Andrea Riseborough, Demi\u00e1n Bichir, John Cho, Betty Gilpin, Lin Shaye and Jacki Weaver.\n\nJohn Cho in The Grudge (Picture: Sony Pictures Entertainment/YouTube)\n\nWhen asked how this latest installment in The Grudge franchise will differ from previous Hollywood films (there have been three in total, not including the original Japanese version Ju-On), Nicolas \u2013 who previously directed The Eyes Of My Mother \u2013 said it\u2019s the most disturbing yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe promised: \u2018The movie\u2019s way more f**ked up.\u2019\n\n\u2018Not that the wave of J-Horror in the early 2000s wasn\u2019t f**ked up \u2014 but this is really f**ked up,\u2019 he added, according to Indie Wire.\n\nA bold claim, considering Japanese horror films are known to be way scarier than Hollywood horror.\n\nThe Grudge trailer promises to be terrifying (Picture: Sony Pictures Entertainment/YouTube)\n\nThe director then added there are elements from the previous films in the franchise but the latest version could very much stand alone.\n\nNicolas revealed: \u2018As far as the imagery, it was finding that balance between [old visuals and new visuals].\n\n\u2018We\u2019re finding the key elements that are just how the grudge expresses itself. So much of this movie is about the fact that this can happen anywhere and that it happens everywhere. It can spread like wildfire.\n\n\u2018Having certain touchstones was important. Obviously with a franchise we don\u2019t want to throw everything out.\u2019\n\n\u2018There is certain stuff that is fun for the fans to see again in a new context with a new spin,\u2019 he added.\n\nWe\u2019ll have to wait and see (through fingers covering our eyes, of course) if the promised horror level lives up to the hype.\n\nThe Grudge hits UK cinemas on 31 January.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
