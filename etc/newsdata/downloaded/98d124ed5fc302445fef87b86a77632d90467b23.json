The company is also facing calls for its breakup from lawmakers, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.\n\nSome longtime industry watchers believe a potential breakup could spur a wave of new innovation in Big Tech.\n\n\"If they took YouTube off of Google, the first meeting of the YouTube board is 'let\u2019s do search.' The first meeting of the Google board is 'let\u2019s do video,'\" said Kara Swisher, Recode editor-at-large, in a recent podcast. \"And the fact that we have no new search engine since forever and no new social network since 2011 \u2014 which is Snapchat \u2014 no substantive social networks, no one\u2019s going to go into those businesses because no one\u2019s going to be able to compete.\"\n\nRegardless of what ultimately happens on the regulatory front, Google's other woes aren't going away anytime soon.\n\nEX-GOOGLE EMPLOYEE ALLEGING PREGNANCY DISCRIMINATION MOVES FORWARD WITH CLAIM\n\nFormer Google employee Chelsey Glasson, who claims the company discriminated against her for being pregnant and wrote an internal memo about it that went viral, has filed a claim against Google with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\n\n\"As a Google employee I witnessed pregnancy discrimination, and then was faced with it in my own life,\" Chelsey Glasson, who worked at the Mountain View, Calif. company for more than five years as a user research lead and manager, said in a statement this week. \"And, like so many women, I felt threatened by retaliation for reporting the discrimination. This memo, which I published internally at Google and has been read by over 11,000 Google employees, states clearly why we must continue to fight this bias.\"\n\nWhen it was reported in June that the Department of Justice, in concert with the FTC, is looking into Silicon Valley broadly over antitrust concerns, shares of Google's parent company dropped 6 percent -- prompting some analysts to warn about the possibility of a breakup.\n\n\u201cTo break up Google, the DoJ would likely have to file a lawsuit and convince judges that Google has undermined competition.\" \u2014 Bank of America Merril Lynch Analyst Justin Post\n\n\u201cTo break up Google, the DoJ would likely have to file a lawsuit and convince judges that Google has undermined competition. It is very rare to break up a company but not unheard of,\u201d Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Justin Post wrote in a note, according to Reuters.\n\nAccording to the complaint filed by the FTC and the New York Attorney General, YouTube explicitly marketed itself as a place for major toy companies to reach children between the ages of 6 and 11.\n\nGOOGLE TARGETED IN NEW ANTITRUST PROBE BY STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL\n\n\u201cGoogle and YouTube knowingly and illegally monitored, tracked, and served targeted ads to young children just to keep advertising dollars rolling in,\u201d New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. \u201cThese companies put children at risk and abused their power, which is why we are imposing major reforms to their practices and making them pay one of the largest settlements for a privacy matter in U.S. history. My office is committed to protecting children and holding those who put our kids in harm\u2019s way \u2014 both on and offline \u2014 accountable.\u201d\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhen contacted by Fox News regarding the state attorneys general probe, Google spokesperson Jose Castaneda released the following statement:\n\n\u201cGoogle\u2019s services help people every day, create more choice for consumers, and support thousands of jobs and small businesses across the country. We continue to work constructively with regulators, including attorneys general, in answering questions about our business and the dynamic technology sector.\"\n\nFox News' Chris Ciaccia contributed to this report.", "description": "Is Google's reign as the benevolent king of Silicon Valley coming to an end?", "authors": ["Christopher Carbone", "Bank Of America Merril Lynch Analyst Justin Post"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/google-logo-getty-images.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
