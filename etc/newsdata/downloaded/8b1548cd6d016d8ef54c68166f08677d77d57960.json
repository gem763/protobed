With the current data, they say, and at the current production rate, it will take 62 years to dig out all the gold that's currently in circulation, but 27 years of current Bitcoin production in order to produce the current stock. After the next halving in 2020, however, the stock-to-flow will climb to 52 years, which is closer to gold. It will continue to climb with each halving event, unlike gold.

Some, like \u2018peter n\u2019, have said that comparing the centuries-old history of gold and a decade-old history of Bitcoin is like saying that a month-old child will rule the financial world when she is 60, asking why BTC and not a 'shitcoin.' Others have raised the argument that the scarcity may be illusory because it\u2019s so easy to create alternatives, followed by the counter-argument that it\u2019s the network effect that has made Bitcoin 'rare' among numerous other cryptocurrencies. Yet, there were a few others who, while agreeing that while the path of BTC may be similar to that of the Internet, Bitcoin itself may be only the first version of what\u2019s to come.\n\nMeanwhile, looking at what is happening now, Bloomberg reports that BTC should brace for another volatility storm. \u201cThe difference between Bitcoin\u2019s upper and lower band in the Trading Envelope indicator is at its narrowest since mid-September,\u201d it says, adding that \u201ca similar narrowing last month preceded a drop of more than 12% for Bitcoin on Sept. 24.\u201d That\u2019s not all, as the article finds that the world\u2019s most popular coin \u201cclosed below its opening price in six of the last seven trading sessions,\u201d and when this pattern happened in mid-September, BTC lost about 20% in one week. \u201cAs it becomes more and more obvious that the Libra thing is not going to take off \u2014 it\u2019s going to be a long time before it becomes an important part of anything Facebook\u2019s doing \u2014 as that becomes more obvious, the volatility will pick up again,\u201d Matt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak + Co. was quoted as saying. \u201cThis issue with what\u2019s going on with Libra and Facebook is a definite headwind and it\u2019s not going to go away.\u201d\n\nWhether bulls or bears are correct \u2013 or perhaps both \u2013 it remains to be seen.\n\nNo pressure. It's a model, a hypothesis, not advice, not a guarantee. Although I think it is a great model and have not seen anything better, I do realize that the model can be incorrect. I suggest everybody does the same. If not, that's not on me. By Christmas 2021 we will know. \u2014 Plan\u20bf (@100trillionUSD) October 21, 2019\n\nBTC is currently (14:57 UTC) trading at c. USD 8,259 and is almost unchanged in the past 24 hours and the past week. The price is down by 17.5% in the past month, and is still up by 26% in the past 12 months.\n\nLear more: Bitcoin Bulls Pushing a New Narrative - BTC at USD 100,000", "description": "Some gold investors are not only looking at the digital gold, Bitcoin (BTC), but also considering investing in it, while its price is expected to hit USD 100,000 by the end of 2021, according to anonymous investor and Twitter user Plan\u20bf, known for his insights into the stock-to-flow ratio, cited even by traditional banks.", "authors": ["Sead Fadilpa\u0161i\u0107"], "top_image": "https://cimg.co/w/articles/0/5da/f1fcb30e27.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
