At the time, he thought it was just Shelly being playful.\n\nTwo days later, however, he realized what the commotion was about.\n\nShelly (left) the shelter cat protected her owner and killed a venomous copperhead snake (right) last week\n\nThe snake (above) snuck into the home last week of Jimmie Nelson of Speedwell, Tennessee\n\nNelson, 81, heard a noise late at night but didn't think much of it. A couple of days later, he noticed the dead snake on his kitchen floor\n\n\u2018I got out and looked under the table and there laid a snake,\u2019 Nelson told WBIR-TV.\n\nA copperhead snake, a venomous breed of snakes, slithered its way into Nelson\u2019s kitchen.\n\nLuckily for Nelson, who has trouble moving because of a stroke, Shelly was there to protect him.\n\n\u2018On the side of the snake's neck and head there were claw marks and one big slash, so we knew right then that the cat had definitely killed the snake and then brought it out a few days later to show it to her little dad,\u2019 said Teresa Seals, Nelson\u2019s daughter.\n\nSeals said that when her mother was alive, she didn\u2019t allow her husband to bring a cat into the house.\n\nNelson, who lives alone after his wife died, wanted a cat as a companion\n\nNow that Jimmie Nelson lives on his own, he wanted a cat as a companion.\n\n\u2018He loves her, he doesn't wanna act like he pays attention but I've caught him actually petting and loving on her,\u2019 Seals said.\n\n\u2018I think the Lord sent the cat to us to save my dad...It was predestined for him to have this cat just to save his life.\u2019\n\nNelson said that this was the first time in 60 years that a snake managed to get inside his house.\n\n\u2018I've killed a million copperhead and rattlesnakes here on the place, but that was the one time it was close,\u2019 said Nelson.", "description": "The incident took place last week in Speedwell, Tennessee, where Jimmie Nelson lives with Shelly, his adopted shelter cat.
