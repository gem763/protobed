His hard work six days a week is what earned the Katy, Texas teenager a spot on the University of Oklahoma Men's Gymnastics team.\n\nBut his workouts look different now.\n\nLast month, the 18-year-old gymnast fell at a friend's house and suffered a C-5 spinal cord injury, leaving him partially paralyzed.\n\nCox says every day is a challenge. \"Right now, my main goal is to get my hands working,\" the teen said.\n\nThe Katy community and the gymnastic community has rallied behind Cox and his family, with the teen receiving video messages from gymnastics teams across the country. On Saturday, a fundraiser was held to help the family with medical expenses.\n\nCox says he's making progress every day in his recovery.\n\n\"An accomplishment today is I can lift my hand off my wheelchair arm, which is nice,\" Cox said.\n\nCox's accomplishments at TIRR Memorial Hermann Hospital have made his parents more proud than ever.\n\n\"He's way stronger than I'll ever be. He truly motivates me to be a better person,\" his mother, Denise, said.", "description": "The teen has received video messages from gymnastics teams across the country as the community continues to support him", "authors": ["Stephanie Whitfield"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/08/24/b80f40ed-1dfd-4cff-98d2-bc9a60e095b0/thumbnail/1200x630/e63c0576708697d4367c27c658177adc/0824-en-houstongymnast-whitfield.jpg"}
