You're in luck, there's one on the market. Well, maybe not for you.\n\nA 1980 F-16A/B Fighting Falcon is for sale in Palm Beach for $8.5 million, according to The Drive. The fighter jet, originally from Jordan, first got attention after aircraft brokerage and leasing firm Jet Lease posted the aircraft for sale on their website.\n\nThe aircraft is unique because it has not been demilitarized, a key difference between it and other F-16 jets that have been privately purchased.\n\nIn fact, the aircraft has been enhanced and includes modern features such as a Link16 datalink, a night vision-compatible cockpit, a data-bus for guided weapons and a Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System, according to The Drive.\n\nLikewise, the aircraft has undergone updates allowing it to fly at least 8,000 hours. Its maximum speed is Mach 2.05 at 40,000 feet \u2014 which translates to approximately 1,573 miles per hour.\n\nSpecifically, the aircraft is being marketed to contractor air service providers who conduct testing services and other things on behalf of the Defense Department, The Drive reports. Its owner must adhere to International Traffic in Arms Regulations designed to limit and control who can have access to the weapons system and keep the US safe.\n\nFurthermore, the F-16 isn't the only one that Jet Lease has to offer. The Drive reports the company also has similar F-16AM and BM Block 20 Mid-Life-Update jets from Jordan as well. If purchased altogether, the four jets could compose a private F-16 mini squadron.\n\nThe F-16 aircraft is used by the US Air Force and other NATO allies including Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Norway. According to Lockheed Martin, approximately 3,000 F-16s are in service in 25 different countries.\n\nJordan purchased F-16 fighter jets from Belgium and the Netherlands between 2008 and 2017.", "description": "Unlike other F-16s sold privately, this one is not demilitarized, meaning it still has the features of a combat aircraft.", "authors": ["Diana Stancy Correll", "Air Force Times"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d6bfc602e22af57fb0fc6e6-1334-667.jpg"}
