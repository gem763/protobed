Do you remember? It happened in May, back when summer was but a beautiful dream rather than a dirty old memory. They named the baby Archie, a name that was used before Archie\u2019s birth in a ruse perpetrated by his cousin George, and potentially the name of a cat who got fat from eating too many grapes (a food that is not particularly good for cats, for the record).\n\nIf you are one of their many fans who sweetly, if a bit oddly (please be honest with yourself), sent them a note to congratulate Meghan and Harry on Archie\u2019s christening, you may have received in return a note from the royal couple as a way of saying thank you. If you did not send them a note to congratulate them (rude) you can still see the note, which was recently posted to Instagram by a fan. Are you ready?\n\nOkay, here it is:\n\nPhoto: @HBO/Twitter\n\nOh haha, ah, God. This is embarrassing. I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s actually the note Jack Berger left for Carrie Bradshaw in season six, episode six of Sex and the City. It happened right after they made up after a brief break in their relationship. Remember? He showed up at her door? And they had sex? And then the next morning Carrie found the Post-it? Anyway, sorry about that. Here is the actual note Meghan and Harry sent to fans:\n\nPhoto: HBO\n\nOh God, no, sorry. I think \u2014 yes, okay, this is actually a screenshot from the next episode \u201cThe Post-it Always Sticks Twice,\u201d where the girls go to that new club called Bed in order for Carrie to get over her Post-it breakup. Remember? Michael Showalter is there, in the Bed club? And then, you probably remember, Samantha buys a doobie from someone in a bar and Carrie smokes it in front of a cop?\n\nAnd then the girls are like, \u201cC\u2019mon, give her a break. She got broken up with on a Post-it today.\u201d And the cop is like, \u201cYeah right, I doubt it.\u201d And then she shows him the Post-it to prove it? And like I guess that was enough to let her go? Because she\u2019s white? Remember? Anyway, I\u2019m sorry!\n\nOkay, this \u2014 finally \u2014 is the note Meghan Markle and Prince Harry sent to fans:\n\n~ I'm sorry. I can't. Don't hate me. ~ Ron Livingston being our favorite Berger \ud83d\ude0d\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0d\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0d\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0d\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0d #Sundance pic.twitter.com/kEEQpJIfDV \u2014 Charlotte Palermino (@charlotteparler) January 25, 2015\n\nUggghh no, shit, I\u2019m sorry \u2014 that\u2019s a photo of Ron Livingston at Sundance in 2015 holding a re-creation of the Post-it. Here is the postcard from Meghan and Harry.\n\nI\u2019m grateful. I can.
