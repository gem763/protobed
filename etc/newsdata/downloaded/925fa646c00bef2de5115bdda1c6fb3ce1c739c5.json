(Teresa Crawford)\n\nAuthorities are encouraging women who might be linked to fetal remains found at an abortion doctor\u2019s home in Illinois to come forward.\n\nThe remains will be given to the Indiana Attorney General\u2019s Office for further investigation, since an investigation by Will County in northeastern Illinois is finished, according to Will County Sheriff Mike Kelley.\n\nWill County Attorney General James Glasgow said Indiana\u2019s state attorney general\u2019s office has indicated that it wants people to call it. Glasgow said Illinois authorities will work with Indiana officials should past patients come forward.\n\n\u201cEven though the clinics are in Indiana, some of these people could\u2019ve lived in Illinois at the time, so we have a connection,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, if the crime is committed in Indiana, they would be the appropriate prosecuting authority, but we probably could assist them.\u201d\n\nKelley said that more than 2,246 medically preserved fetal remains were located at the home of deceased abortion doctor Ulrich \u201cGeorge\u201d Klopfer. Klopfer died Sept. 3 of what authorities said were natural causes.\n\nKelley and Glasgow said the remains date from 2000 to 2002, which coincides with the time Klopfer would have been performing abortions in Indiana. Glasgow determined that paperwork and science helped determine the age of the fetal remains.\n\nBecause Klopfer is deceased, Glasgow emphasized that no criminal charges could be filed even though the late doctor did not adhere to Indiana law in the disposal of fetal remains.\n\nIf a \u201cvictim\u201d were underage at the time of her abortion and the person who impregnated her was not, that person could be guilty of statutory rape, Glasgow said. \u201cBecause of the age of the remains, I don\u2019t know if that would be possible under Indiana law or not,\u201d he said, adding that there was no further criminal inquiry in Illinois.\n\nMore than 50 detectives searched Klopfer\u2019s home, where they found more than 70 cardboard boxes that contained the fetal remains, according to Kelley.\n\n\u201cThere were hundreds and hundreds of boxes that we had to go through to make sure there were no more of these remains in that residence,\u201d he said. \u201cI can tell you that in the 31 years that I\u2019ve been doing this job, I\u2019ve never seen anything like this, ever.\u201d\n\nThe fetal remains were stored among other items belonging to Klopfer in his garage, Kelley said.\n\n\u201cJust imagine your garage and you walk and you\u2019re storing whatever \u2014 car parts, bottles of motor oil,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what the garage looked like ceiling to floor.\u201d\n\nVice President Pence tweeted Monday that the discovery of the fetal remains should \u201cshock the conscience of every American\u201d and noted that the state of Indiana had taken away Klopfer\u2019s medical license when Pence served as governor.\n\nHis actions should be fully & thoroughly investigated, the remains of the unborn must be treated with dignity & respect & this abortionists defenders should be ashamed. We will always stand for the unborn. https://t.co/L6cdjnTS3A \u2014 Vice President Mike Pence (@VP) September 16, 2019\n\nSouth Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a Democratic presidential candidate, said Wednesday he found the discovery to be \u201cextremely disturbing\u201d and that he hopes that the matter will be \u201cfully investigated.\u201d\n\n\u201cI also hope that it doesn\u2019t get caught up in politics at a time when women need access to health care,\u201d he said.\n\nKlopfer was considered Indiana\u2019s \u201cmost prolific\u201d abortion doctor, with tens of thousands of procedures performed, the South Bend Tribune reported. The state suspended his medical license in 2016 for failing to exercise reasonable care and for violating notice and documentation requirements, the Tribune reported. The Women\u2019s Pavilion shut down the same year.\n\nIn Indiana, fetal remains must be buried or cremated. Rep. Jackie Walorski (R-Ind.) said in a statement that she would consider proposing federal legislation related to the disposal of aborted fetuses. Walorski also called on state and federal authorities to conduct a full investigation into Klopfer.\n\nThe macabre discovery of fetal remains contains echoes of the case of Kermit Gosnell, a Philadelphia doctor who is serving a life sentence after a jury in 2013 convicted him of murder for snipping the spinal cords of three babies who lived for a few moments outside the womb. Investigators found dismembered remains in milk jugs and glass jars inside Gosnell\u2019s clinic.\n\nThere\u2019s no indication why the fetal remains were at Klopfer\u2019s residence, according to authorities.\n\n\u201cWe collectively ask that the media and the public not pass judgment on the Klopfer family who made this startling discovery and who have been cooperating fully throughout this entire process,\u201d Kelley said.\n\nRead more:\n\nDemocrats\u2019 leftward shift on third-trimester abortion\n\nWhy the N.Y.
