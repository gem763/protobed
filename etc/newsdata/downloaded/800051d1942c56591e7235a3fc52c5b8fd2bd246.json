The conventional wisdom around the league was that the Grizzlies would buy out Iguodala, who is likely playing his final NBA season and wants to do so on a contender.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nExcept, nothing is ever as easy as it should be in Memphis, as Shams Charania of The Athletic notes in this report.\n\nSources: Memphis wants three-time champion Andre Iguodala to report to training camp and is refusing right now to engage in buyout, which would prevent Iguodala from finishing a Hall of Fame career on his terms because this may be his final NBA season. \u2014 Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) September 9, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nIguodala is VP of NBPA, one of league\u2019s most respected and desires a contender at this stage. Young, rebuilding Grizzlies received a valuable 2024 1st from Golden State in Iguodala trade, and after Dwight Howard buyout, were expected to eventually have same talks with Iguodala. https://t.co/feAQl4Jbv0 \u2014 Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) September 9, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nThis sounds like a leverage play from an agent.\n\nStory continues\n\nFrom the Grizzlies\u2019 perspective, why buy Iguodala out now? Wait until the trade deadline, see if you can trade him and get an asset back to help your rebuild, and if not buy him out then. In the interim, a veteran leader and consummate professional such as Iguodala would be welcomed in a young Memphis locker room with players such as Jaren Jackson Jr. and Ja Morant.\n\nHowever, that\u2019s not what Iguodala would want. He would want to be with whatever contending team he\u2019s going to join for the full season. He wants a buyout sooner rather than later.\n\nMaybe that means Iguodala will have to give up more than just the price of a minimum contract to get a buyout done. We\u2019ll see how this all plays out. But someone is trying to gain a little leverage with this leak.", "description": "Memphis may want to try and keep Iguodala up to the trade deadline to see if they can get a pick back for him.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/GoG7sjsaLk5WevtqeDLIVQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MTkuMjc5Mjc5Mjc5Mjc5Mw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/R5dVd9dd1jcdv5N9CzNrbA--~B/aD00OTk7dz04ODg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/349af4cfcad850579d63fc78adfc74cd", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
