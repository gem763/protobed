Now Trump has more ammunition against the Fed from the new plans of \u201cSuper Mario\u201d \u2014 European Central Bank President Mario Draghi.\n\nDraghi is known as Super Mario for adopting extremely stimulative monetary policy to pull Europe out of pending fiscal disaster. On Thursday the ECB announced another rate cut and more bond buying, a move that pushed up U.S. stocks.\n\nIn addition, there are rumors of an interim trade deal with China \u2014 but with trade deal news, never trust the first reports. Regardless, Trump is determined to run up the stock market. Please see \u201cTrump\u2019s China gambit is working for now \u2014 this chart tells the story\u201d and \u201cTrump claims the stock market would be higher if he hadn\u2019t confronted China \u2014 is he right?\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s pull this news together with the help of two charts.\n\nCharts\n\nPlease click here for an annotated chart of long bond ETF TLT, -0.66%.\n\nPlease click here for an annotated chart of S&P 500 ETF SPY, +0.35%, which mirrors the S&P 500 Index SPX, +0.29%. For the sake of transparency, this chart was previously published and no changes have been made.\n\nNote the following:\n\n\u2022 The first chart shows that bonds traced a parabolic move on recession fears.\n\n\u2022 The first chart shows that The Arora Report gave a sell signal on TLT at a time when almost everybody was expecting it to go higher. With the benefit of hindsight, The Arora Report\u2019s signal to short-sell bonds has proven spot-on. At the same time, a signal was given to buy inverse bond ETF TBT, +1.22% for those who could not short-sell. Both trades are now nicely profitable.\n\n\u2022 The first chart shows that at a time when bonds were rocketing, the relative strength index (RSI) was showing divergences.\n\n\u2022 The second chart shows a megaphone pattern. At the time the chart was first published, many gurus and media were using this chart to proclaim that the stock market was about to fall out of bed. The Arora Report took the opposite position, saying the upside move was possible. That call has turned out to be correct. Please see \u201cA \u2018megaphone\u2019 pattern in the stock market sounds scary \u2014 but there\u2019s no need for dread.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Gold ETF GLD, +0.21%, silver ETF SLV, -0.18% and gold miner ETF GDX, -1.62% are moving higher on the ECB news.\n\n\u2022 Note that the stock market is now overbought in the short term. Overbought markets tend to be vulnerable.\n\n\u2022 Apple AAPL, -0.23% stock has moved up after the introduction of new iPhones and a lower-than-anticipated price on its streaming service.\n\n\u2022 The carnage in cloud stocks, such as CrowdStrike CRWD, +0.80%, Zoom Video Communications ZM, +1.02%, Okta OKTA, -0.20% and Twilio TWLO, +3.08%, has temporarily stopped.\n\n\u2022 Short squeezes in laggard retail and energy stocks are showing signs of easing, according to algorithms at The Arora Report. Examples of retails stocks that have experienced short squeezes are Michaels Cos. MIK, -5.13%, J.C. Penney JCP, -11.20%, Signet Jewelers SIG, +1.46%, Rite Aid RAD, -21.28% and Best Buy BBY, +0.03%. Examples of energy stocks that have experienced short squeezes include Comstock Resources CRK, -2.52%, Helmerich & Payne HP, -4.43% and Halliburton HAL, -1.50%.\n\n\u2022 Semiconductor stocks such as Intel INTC, +0.42%, AMD AMD, +1.51% and Micron Technology MU, -0.08% not only did not join the cloud stocks on the downside, but they have rallied on hopes of successful trade talks with China.\n\n\u2022 Another sign of strength in the stock market is that in spite of government investigations, the stocks of Facebook FB, -0.54%, Google GOOG, +1.15% GOOGL, +1.23% and Amazon AMZN, +1.13% have not reacted to the downside.\n\nAsk Arora: Nigam Arora answers your questions about investing in stocks, ETFs, bonds, gold and silver, oil and currencies.

On the other side, progress in trade talks is positive. Further, a breakout to new highs will prompt the momo (momentum) crowd to more aggressively buy stocks; the momo crowd is already buying stocks. Note that the smart money is lightly selling into the strength. Bulls are hopeful that the Fed will cut interest rates. So watch out below if the Fed does not cut interest rates.\n\nUnder these market conditions, investors ought to follow a proven adaptive model with a track record in both bull and bear markets, such as the ZYX Asset Allocation Models. In general the model is cautiously bullish and protecting the portfolio with hedges and a fair amount of cash.\n\nKeep in mind that if the market dips as it often does between September and November, you will not be able to take advantage of opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.\n\nDisclosure: Subscribers to The Arora Report may have positions in the securities mentioned in this article or may take positions at any time.
