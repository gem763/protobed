A swordsman sent from the future, Trunks turns out to be the child of two other members of the cast (whose romance itself is a narrative curveball), and it\u2019s not until later in the story that we see Trunks as a child.\n\nTrunks didn\u2019t make his debut in the \"Dragon Ball\" manga or anime until 1991, several years after each started. Still, he went on to become one of the franchise\u2019s most popular characters and an instantly recognizable symbol of the series, and now merchandiser Premium Bandai is offering his iconic outfit for fans to wear.\n\nBut there\u2019s an additional level of temporal complexity to Trunks. Remember how we said Trunks made his first appearance in 1991? At that time, \"Dragon Ball\" was just about the biggest thing in the anime world, and so creator Akira Toriyama\u2019s artwork from that period ended up having a huge influence on other artists. So not only is Premium Bandai\u2019s Trunks outfit a recreation of the time-traveling character\u2019s wardrobe, it\u2019s also a visual short-hand for \u201ccool anime clothes\u201d circa 1990, with an ultra-short jacket and billowy pants.\n\nThe jacket\u2019s short hem and the pants\u2019 high waist do help create the appearance of anime character-class long legs (similar to the effect of the fashionable \u201canime heroine skirts\u201d we looked at a while back). However, Premium Bandai realizes that some \"Dragon Ball\" fans might not want to turn the clock back quite so far, and so in addition to the \u201cTrunks length\u201d jacket pictured above, you can also get the garment in medium and large sizes, which keep the Capsule Corp logo on the sleeve while giving the jacket a longer, more modern cut.\n\nThe all-cotton jacket is available from Premium Bandai\u2019s online shop here priced at 13,200 yen, and the 9,900-yen pants (made of polyester) here. Shipping for both is scheduled for January.\n\nSource: Premium Bandai\n\nRead more stories from SoraNews24.\n\n-- Official Sailor Moon and Dragon Ball cosplay outfits from Japan turn your pet into an anime hero\n\n-- 30th Anniversary collaboration results in vivid, eye-catching Dragon Ball T-shirts!\n\n-- Cuddly Doraemon PC cushion looks as awesome as the time-traveling anime kitty\u2019s cool gadgets\n\nExternal Link\n\nhttps://soranews24.com/2019/10/18/dragon-ball-trunks-jacket-on-sale-gives-you-the-look-of-a-90s-anime-hero-today%E3%80%90photos%E3%80%91/\n\n\u00a9 SoraNews24", "description": "The storyline for \"Dragon Ball\" is anything but straightforward, and one of the trickier character arcs to unravel is that of Trunks.
