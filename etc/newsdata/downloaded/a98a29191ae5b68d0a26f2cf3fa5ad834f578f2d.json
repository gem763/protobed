At the same time there was a 36% increase in fatalities due to safety related occurrences,\" said Harris.\n\nAlthough UNTU disputes this figure and believes it only reflects a fraction of the true state of rail safety, the statistics known to the RSR is of great concern to it.\n\n\"Parents must teach their children that it is no joke playing near a railway line, not even to mention a moving train. These children are not only putting their own lives at risk, but also the lives of the train driver and the train assistant as they are forced to watch the children playing on the wagons instead of keeping their eyes on the railway lines and on the signals they are passing.\n\n\"To make matters worse, it is the train driver and the train assistant who will be charged if anything happens to the children putting their jobs in jeopardy. This is not even considering the emotional trauma the train driver and train assistant goes through if they cannot prevent an injury,\" said Harris.\n\nAccording to Harris, the RSR must target these areas to create awareness for train safety at schools and in local communities, get the community to identify the specific children and to speak to their parents.\n\nHe appealed to all UNTU trains drivers to immediately report similar incidents to the union so that UNTU can ensure that it is reported to the SAPS so it can act.", "description": "An 11-year-old boy has been captured on video inciting his friends to join him in train surfing one of Transnet goods trains in KwaZulu-Natal.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9531/fc402dbd411842dfbe0c51a067eb14bb.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
