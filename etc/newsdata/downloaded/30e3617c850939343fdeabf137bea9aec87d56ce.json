But historians could choose to put two names on the bill instead of one.\n\nNicklas Backstrom will embark on his 13th year in the NHL when the Capitals open their season Wednesday at the St. Louis Blues. It\u2019s the final year of a 10-year contract the center signed in 2010, and he hasn\u2019t equivocated about his hope that he and Ovechkin finish their careers with the club that drafted them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very fortunate to be (able) to spend all our careers so far with the same team. Hopefully we both will stay that way, too,\u201d Backstrom told The Washington Times. \u201cI love the city. I love the fans. D.C. is like family to me. It\u2019s home for me.\u201d\n\nBut Backstrom\u2019s future here is unsettled. Goalie Braden Holtby is also entering the final year of his deal, and the Capitals are airtight up against the salary cap as it is. When training camp started, general manager Brian MacLellan said he hadn\u2019t yet discussed an extension with Backstrom\u2019s agent. Difficult decisions are coming.\n\nTeammates find it hard to imagine a Capitals team without Ovechkin and Backstrom at the core of the roster.\n\n\u201cFor me, I played against them since Day 1, since I got in the league, and they\u2019ve been probably the most dynamic duo you can think of over the last 10 years,\u201d forward Carl Hagelin said. \u201cWhen you think Washington Capitals, you think Alex Ovechkin and you think Nicklas Backstrom.\u201d\n\nGrowing up together\n\nOvechkin and Backstrom maintained a friendship while also pushing each other to improve; Backstrom once said Ovechkin is \u201cthe guy I\u2019ve yelled at the most\u201d in his career. Before and after winning the Stanley Cup, a bond endured.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been together since Day 1 and the chemistry that we have on the ice is tremendous, and I hope he\u2019s going to stay,\u201d Ovechkin said at preseason media day.\n\nLater that day, Backstrom joked, \u201cHe took me under his wing, and then when we got older I took him under my wing.\u201d\n\nAfter a strong junior career with Bryn\u00e4s IF in his homeland of Sweden, Backstrom arrived in Washington two years after Ovechkin as the fourth overall draft pick in 2006. As a Capitals youngster, Backstrom said Ovechkin would pick him up on his drive into town for home games, and they\u2019d often hang out at night.\n\nIn a way, they grew up together in the District. Now both are married with kids: Ovechkin with 1-year-old son Sergei, Backstrom with 6-year-old daughter Haley and 3-year-old son Vince.\n\n\u201cWe were spending more time together off the ice here in D.C. when we both didn\u2019t have kids and we were single, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Backstrom recalled. \u201cNow the situation is a little different. We got our own things to worry about.\u201d\n\nTheir off-ice friendship helped their on-ice chemistry when Backstrom started centering Ovechkin\u2019s line during his rookie season. Of Backstrom\u2019s franchise-record 642 career assists, 248 of them \u2014 a remarkable 38.6% \u2014 set up Ovechkin goals.\n\nOther milestones are within the Swede\u2019s reach this season. He\u2019s just five games away from playing his 900th in a Capitals sweater and 27 points from 900 for his career, following in Ovechkin\u2019s steps.\n\nTeammates credit Backstrom\u2019s vision and hockey IQ as the strongest part of his game, and in a constantly changing NHL, attributes like those have helped Backstrom keep beating opponents and tally 50 assists for six straight years.\n\n\u201cI have no scientific explanation for it,\u201d Washington defenseman Nick Jensen said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the way some guys are and Backstrom is probably one of the best guys I\u2019ve ever seen at it, with the way he thinks about the game and the way he processes the game out there. It\u2019s on a different level than most guys.\u201d\n\nGetting his due\n\nEach year, the NHL Players Association conducts a poll, asking active players their opinions on everything from the league\u2019s best goalie to the arena with the worst ice. Backstrom received the moniker of \u201cmost underrated player in the league\u201d in 2017-18. A year later, he was second place in the same category, but his vote share rose to 11.4 %.\n\nThis puzzles teammates like Nic Dowd.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been in the league for 12, 13, 14 years yet he\u2019s still underrated, which makes no sense,\u201d Dowd said. \u201cI think a little bit of it has to do with the fact that he plays with such elite players in (Evgeny) Kuznetsov, Ovechkin, (T.J.) Oshie, guys that he\u2019s surrounded by all the time \u2026 People say, \u2018Oh yeah, he\u2019s underrated,\u2019 because he\u2019s surrounded by superstars and he himself is a superstar.\u201d\n\n\u201c(Backstrom) kind of stays underneath the radar in terms of seeking out different opportunities, whether it\u2019s commercials or publicity,\u201d coach Todd Reirden added. \u201cHe likes to kind of fly under the radar, so I think some of this stuff is a little bit to his personality.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s fine by Backstrom, who never sought much attention in the first place.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to go out and \u2018flash\u2019 about things,\u201d he said. \u201cI like to go out, do my job and do the best I can. That\u2019s my personality.\u201d\n\nWashington\u2019s younger centers learn a lot by watching Backstrom. Dowd praised his defensive awareness; in turn, Backstrom credited center Sergei Fedorov, his mentor early in his Capitals career.\n\n\u201cHe just took so much pride in being a two-way player and he was so good defensively, with his stick, positioning, everything,\u201d Backstrom said. \u201cSo just watching him out there, he was always strong with the puck, making smart plays. Nothing fancy, just a real solid player.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a given that, when the puck drops, Backstrom wants to put the distraction of his expiring contract out of mind. How will he put the blinders on?\n\n\u201cThe key is just to think about the team,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to make the playoffs. That\u2019s gonna be \u2014 it\u2019s always been my mindset. I\u2019m not gonna change that. I mean, I know I don\u2019t have a contract next year, but you just gotta put that aside and think about what we do as a team, how we develop as a team. That\u2019s what we gotta do.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
