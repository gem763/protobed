Haga created a soybean extract that required her to soak the beans overnight and crush them into a cloth.\n\nAfter reportedly spending more than two hours fine-tuning the extract's concentration, Haga finally dipped a fine brush into the ink and wrote her essay on a thin traditional Japanese paper called \"washi. \" Once the ink dried, the letters seemingly disappeared, blending in with the paper's off white hue.\n\n\"When the professor said in class that he would give a high mark for creativity, I decided that I would make my essay stand out from others,\" Haga told the BBC. The first-year student rummaged said she remembered hearing about the invisible ink in an animated TV show she'd watched as a child.\n\n\"I just hoped that no-one would come up with the same idea,\" Haga told the BBC.\n\nHaga's professor, Yuji Yamada, told the BBC he was surprised by Haga's choice but had \"little doubt\" Haga's words would come out clearly. He decided to give his pupil full marks for her creativity. To keep some of the letters hidden, the professor didn't read the essay to the end.\n\nThat may have been for the best, according to Yamada, who told the BBC that the bulk of her focus went toward the ink and that the essay itself was \"nothing special.\"", "description": "At first, the blank piece of paper resembled trash, but when the professor held it against a hot stove the black ink began to appear line by line.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9464/e191364e62d542c28bb69fd9abe93fbf.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
