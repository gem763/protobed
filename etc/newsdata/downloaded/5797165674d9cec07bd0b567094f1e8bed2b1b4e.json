He\u2019s also said to have used Facebook to solicit further business.\n\n\u201cWhats your move?\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of the bills were paid by the California game developer\u2019s financial staff before the fraud was detected,\u201d said the DoJ. \u201cHo also used the identities of a Texas resident and the founder of a tech company in India [\u2026] which he similarly used as part of his cryptocurrency mining operation.\u201d\n\nHo is also alleged to have charged hundreds of thousands of dollars to his victim\u2019s credit cards, which they paid before realizing the fraud.\n\nIf found guilty on all counts, Ho faces more than 30 years in prison. He\u2019s now reportedly in the custody of Singaporean police, under investigation for various alleged offences committed under Singaporean law.\n\nWant more Hard Fork?
