Given the hoopla, that would be a tougher argument to make in 2020.\n\nBut Mueller also notes that the meeting wouldn't have broken laws unless it provided useful information (it didn't), and even then the case would be difficult to argue in court.\n\nDemocrats want an agreement with Republicans to not use hacked documents during campaigns.\n\nOn Monday, Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez wrote an open letter to his Republican counterpart pledging the DNC would not \"weaponize stolen private data for political gain.\"\n\nThe letter is an attempt to bring the RNC to the negotiating table on the issue. Until the two discuss terms, that pledge has no teeth \u2014 there is no prescribed consequence if a Democrat used hacked materials.\n\nMeanwhile, an RNC representative quoted chairwoman Ronna McDaniel on its stance for 2020: \"Any breach of our political organizations \u2014 regardless of party \u2014 is an affront to all of us, and we should come together as Americans to prevent it from ever happening again.\"\n\nThat official did not respond to a follow up questions about the consequences for a candidate not complying.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not reply to requests for comment.\n\nThe bottom line, via Rosenzweig: \"If you don\u2019t spank a dog when it doodles on the rug, it will keep doodling on the rug.\"\n\nEditor's note: This story originally misspelled Paul Rosenzweig's name and has been corrected.", "description": "Laws remain fuzzy, and Trump's behavior in 2016 changed the norms.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/lprbfFz4HfEK2z9NgkoKCkU-BFA=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/04/25/1556205029086.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-25"}
