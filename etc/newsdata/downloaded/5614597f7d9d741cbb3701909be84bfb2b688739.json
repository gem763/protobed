The negotiations could have less of a short-term impact on the market.\"\n\nApple Inc rose 1.2%, lifting the technology sector by 0.6%, after Longbow Research upgraded the company's stock to \"buy\", citing higher iPhone 11 demand.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 119.55 points, or 0.45%, to 26,465.56, the S&P 500 gained 16 points, or 0.55%, to 2,935.4 and the Nasdaq Composite added 39.27 points, or 0.5%, to 7,943.01.\n\nStock markets have been rankled in recent weeks by weak economic indicators showing a contraction in U.S. manufacturing and a bleak reading on business activity, bolstering bets of another interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve to combat a slowdown.\n\nData on Thursday showed U.S. consumer prices were unchanged in September, while underlying inflation retreated.\n\nAmong other stocks, Delta Air Lines Inc fell after the carrier forecast disappointing current-quarter profit.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.73-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.47-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 5 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 13 new highs and 115 new lows.
