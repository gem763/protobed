Eliot Engel", "language": "en", "text": "Six in 10 registered Democrats in New York\u2019s 16th Congressional District aren\u2019t sure who they\u2019ll vote for in the June 2020 primary \u2014 despite longtime incumbent House Foreign Affairs Chair Eliot Engel\u2019s place on the ballot \u2014 according to a new poll from Data for Progress.\n\nEngel, who has served 16 terms in Congress, is facing two primary challengers next June: Jamaal Bowman, a middle school principal from the Bronx who\u2019s endorsed by the progressive group Justice Democrats, and Andom Ghebreghiorgis, a special education teacher born to parents who immigrated to the U.S. from Eritrea.\n\nThe burgeoning uncertainty over Engel\u2019s reelection is just the latest example of an upending of politics as usual in the Democratic Party. The most famous upset of a Democratic congressional incumbent by a progressive primary challenger came in 2018, when now-Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez shocked the political classes by unseating a machine-backed Queens Democrat and landing on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe new poll from the progressive think tank Data for Progress, which is aligned with Bowman, surveyed 578 registered Democrats in New York\u2019s 16th District between September 9 and 13. Half of the registered Democrats in the district said they were not sure how to describe Engel\u2019s political viewpoint. If the primary were held today, 29 percent said they would vote for Engel, and 10 percent said they would support Bowman. One percent said the would vote for Ghebreghiorgis. Bowman\u2019s campaign has raised $189,000 to Engel\u2019s $566,200 . Ghebreghiorgis has raised $67,400 so far.\n\nThe poll results represented a relatively slim lead for such an entrenched incumbent \u2014 and progressive activists see the weakness as an opening for one of the challengers. \u201cThis is a wide open race, Engel is extremely vulnerable, and Jamaal, as a longtime middle school principal in the district, has the momentum and record of service to win this,\u201d said Alexandra Rojas, executive director of Justice Democrats.\n\nOver his three decades in Congress, Engel has built a reputation for being hawkish on foreign policy and friendly toward Wall Street. Like many other Democrats, he voted for the Iraq War, the 1994 crime bill, and to repeal parts of the Glass-Steagall regulations on Wall Street. Engel initially opposed the Iran nuclear deal, but now says he supports it.\n\nBowman is busy hitting Engel for his hawkish policies. The challenger\u2019s website says his campaign is about supporting \u201cschools and education, not bombs and incarceration.\u201d He\u2019s in favor of Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, and reforming the criminal justice system. Bowman pledged to refuse corporate PAC money and has criticized Engel\u2019s reliance on PAC money and large-dollar contributions.\n\nGhebreghiorgis said that the poll shows vulnerability. \u201cWhat does it say that a 16-term incumbent can\u2019t count on the support of even 1 in 3 voters in the district?\u201d he said. \u201cFrom my conversations with voters across the district, I know that they want an end to politics as usual \u2014 big money and special interests, forever wars, mass incarceration, housing unaffordability, and income inequality. They want new leadership and transformational change from someone homegrown. We are the only campaign that has a detailed platform and vision rooted in economic, racial, and environmental justice and international solidarity.\u201d\n\nThe primary is still eight months away, and it\u2019s normal for a large portion of voters to still be undecided. But the fact that voters in the district can\u2019t describe the political ideology of an official who has represented the state for some 30 years underscores the argument made by both challengers that he\u2019s lost touch with his constituents. Engel represented the 16th District since 2013, holding seats in the 17th and 19th districts before that. He was a New York state assemblyman from 1977 to 1988, when he was first elected to Congress.", "description": "Will longtime Rep.
