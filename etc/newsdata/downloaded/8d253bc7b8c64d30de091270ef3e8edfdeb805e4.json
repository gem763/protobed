CIX has emerged as one of Canada\u2019s most coveted start-up and investment conferences. Launched in 2008, CIX brings together a curated list of start-ups, investors, and corporates from across Canada for their annual conference. Speakers and panelists included Alex Baker, Partner Relay ventures, David Ossip, Chairman and CEO of Ceridian, Mr. Sunil Sharma, Managing Partner, Toronto TechStars, Noah Shipman, partner Vistara Capital Partners to name a few.\n\nThe conference spanned across two days, where 30 selected companies, (CIX top 20 early stage) and (CIX top 10 growth stage) pitched their businesses to a panel chaired by leading VC investors from across Canada. One firm amongst the 30 was chosen as the winner of the Canadian chapter of the Startup World Cup, and this firm will be representing Canada in the final conference which will be held in San Francisco.\n\nThe conference showcased companies forging innovation in Fintech, Healthtech, AI, Education, Enterprise tech etc. It is commendable how a country with a 36 million population is leveraging the diverse human capital and resources to make greater impacts in global innovation.\n\nWe got to hear an exciting by Marie Chevrier, Founder and CEO of Sampler. Sampler is a Direct-to-Consumer product sampling platform helping brands like L\u2019Oreal deliver samples online and gather the insights they need to build one-to-one relationship with their consumers. I was able to learn first-hand from Marie on how Sampler is bring \u201ctargeted\u201d into sampling, and thereby adding significant value to major CPG firms across the globe.\n\nAnother inspiring founder we spoke to was, Katherine Homuth, Founder and CEO of Sheertex. Sheertex produces the world\u2019s first sheer knit, made with the same type of fibres found in ballistic materials. The Sheertex knit can be used in a variety of high-performance products such as inner wear, sheer, socks and other apparels. Although Katherine was one of the last to showcase her business at the CIX conference, her passion and focus was evident from the get-go and sure enough, Sheertex was chosen as the winner of the Canadian chapter of the Startup world cup. We wish Sheertex the best for the next leg of the Startup World Cup.\n\nThe event also honored Dax Dasilva founder and CEO Lightspeed as CIX 2019\u2019s Innovator of the Year award. Montreal based Lightspeed is the leading global POS platform for small and medium-sized businesses.\n\nThe most remarkable aspect about the Canadian start-up ecosystem is how each individual, corporate, government bodies in the community is acting as an enabler to build, scale and thereby support these ventures reach their next phase of growth. With such a strong community support, the future of Canadian business looks bright, indeed.\n\nIndia, we believe offers an immense opportunity for ventures from Canada in scaling up their companies exponentially on a global scale. Brand Capital International is confident of partnering with visionary founders to enable their foray into India.", "description": "With every passing year, Canada is making great strides in tech innovation which was evident in the recent CIX conference held in Toronto.
