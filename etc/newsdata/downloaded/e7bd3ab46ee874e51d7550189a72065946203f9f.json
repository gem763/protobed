I'm Neil Cavuto, and like you, I'm a little stunned and a little heartbroken,\" he said at the beginning of his broadcast. \"I don't know what to say. Shepard Smith, as I said just a few days ago on this very network, a decent human being, a heart as big as Texas. I didn't say Texas at the time, maybe just lower Manhattan. A better newsman, you probably cannot find.\"\n\nHe added: \"Shepard, I don't know what the heck you are planning to do or where you will go, but I just know you will be great at doing it, and you deserve the best that life has to offer. I'm sorry if I'm a little shell-shocked here, but I'm going to miss my buddy. All right. Onto the news at hand as Shepard would say.\"\n\nThe Fox White House correspondent John Roberts, reporting on Cavuto's show from the White House, also looked like he had gotten the wind knocked out of him by Smith's surprise announcement.\n\n\"I want to get the read from John Roberts at the White House about all of this. John, I apologize for being a little shell-shocked on this other development here, but, uh, take it away,\" Cavuto said.\n\n\"I've just been trying to compile my thoughts, too, Neil. I walked out here to do the hit and suddenly got hit by a subway train, holy mackerel,\" Roberts responded.\n\nSmith's announcement comes amid mounting tensions between Fox's news hosts, which include Smith and Cavuto, who report objectively on the Trump administration and the nighttime opinion hosts, including Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, and Laura Ingraham, who are openly pro-Trump.\n\nRead more: The growing divide between Fox News' pro-Trump opinion hosts and news anchors is on full display\n\nSmith and the other straight-news host at Fox News, Trump's favorite network, have frequently been on the receiving end of attacks from Trump throughout the administration, including a critical tweet yesterday.\n\n\"With people like Andrew Napolitano, who wanted to be a Supreme Court Justice & I turned him down (he's been terrible ever since), Shep Smith, @donnabrazile (who gave Crooked Hillary the debate questions & got fired from CNN), & others, @FoxNews doesn't deliver for US anymore. It is so different than it used to be. Oh well, I'm President,\" Trump tweeted.", "description": "\"Whoa.
