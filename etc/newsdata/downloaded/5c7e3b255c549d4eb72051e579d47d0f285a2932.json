(MSFT.O) has won the Pentagon\u2019s $10 billion cloud computing contract, the Defense Department said on Friday, beating out favorite Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O).\n\nFILE PHOTO: The Microsoft sign is shown on top of the Microsoft Theatre in Los Angeles, California, U.S. October 19,2018. REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\nThe contracting process had long been mired in conflict of interest allegations, even drawing the attention of President Donald Trump, who has publicly taken swipes at Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos. Trump in August said his administration was reviewing Amazon\u2019s bid after complaints from other companies.\n\nThe Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud (JEDI) contract is part of a broader digital modernization of the Pentagon meant to make it more technologically agile. Specifically, a goal of JEDI is to give the military better access to data and the cloud from battlefields and other remote locations.\n\nOracle Corp (ORCL.N) had expressed concerns about the award process for the contract, including the role of a former Amazon employee who worked on the project at the Defense Department but recused himself, then later left the Defense Department and returned to Amazon Web Services.\n\nIn a statement, an Amazon Web Services (AWS) spokesman said the company was \u201csurprised about this conclusion.\u201d\n\nThe company said that a \u201cdetailed assessment purely on the comparative offerings\u201d would \u201cclearly lead to a different conclusion,\u201d according to the statement.\n\nAWS is considering options for protesting the award, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.\n\nAlthough the Pentagon boasts the world\u2019s most potent fighting force, its information technology remains woefully inadequate, according to many officials.\n\nOfficials have complained of having outdated computer systems and being unable to access files or share information as quickly as they might be able to in the private sector.\n\n\u201cIf I am a warfighter, I want as much data as you could possibly give me,\u201d Lieutenant General Jack Shanahan, the director of the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, told reporters in August describing the importance of the contract.\n\nSome companies were concerned that a single award would give the winner an unfair advantage in follow-on work. The Pentagon has said it planned to award future cloud deals to multiple contractors.\n\nThis week, U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper removed himself from reviewing the deal due to his adult son\u2019s employment with one of the original contract applicants, IBM Corp (IBM.N). IBM had previously bid for the contract but had already been eliminated from the competition.\n\nMicrosoft said it was working on a comment. IBM and Oracle did not immediately return requests for comment.\n\nIn a book slated for publication Oct. 29, retired Navy commander Guy Snodgrass, who served as a speech writer to former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, said Trump called Mattis and directed him to \u201cscrew Amazon\u201d by preventing it from bidding on the JEDI contract, according to an excerpt of the book seen by Reuters ahead of its release.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to do that,\u201d Mattis later told other Pentagon officials, according to the excerpt. \u201cThis will be done by the book, both legally and ethically.\u201d\n\nSnodgrass declined to comment pending the release of his book.\n\nIn a statement announcing Microsoft as the winner, the Pentagon underscored its view that the competition was conducted fairly and legally.\n\n\u201cAll (offers) were treated fairly and evaluated consistently with the solicitation\u2019s stated evaluation criteria. Prior to the award, the department conferred with the DOD Inspector General, which informed the decision to proceed,\u201d it said.\n\nMicrosoft shares were up 3% to $144.98 in after-hours trading after the news. Amazon shares were down 0.92% to $1,745.12.\n\nThe Pentagon said it had awarded more than $11 billion across 10 separate cloud contracts over the past two years.\n\n\u201cAs we continue to execute the DOD Cloud Strategy, additional contracts are planned for both cloud services and complementary migration and integration solutions necessary to achieve effective cloud adoption,\u201d the Pentagon said.", "description": "Microsoft Corp. has won the Pentagon's $10 billion cloud computing contract, the Defense Department said on Friday, beating out favorite Amazon.com Inc .", "authors": ["Phil Stewart", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191026&t=2&i=1445059770&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O1V0", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
