The Pelosi-led fund is a big contributor to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and helps finance Pelosi's own campaign and political action committee.\n\nPelosi, who was first elected to Congress in 1987, announced a formal impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump a month ago and has been racking up donations for her party. Her fund has raised $11.1 million this year, and in September pulled in $259,100 from Stewart and Lynda Resnick, whose company owns POM Wonderful and Fiji Water, and the same amount from Deborah Simon, whose family started the Simon Property Group.\n\nSmith was the fund's seventh-biggest contributor in the quarter, according to the FEC website. It's by far the biggest check he's written for a politician or campaign this year. His financial support for Pelosi came just as he was releasing his book, \"Tools and Weapons: The Promise and the Peril of the Digital Age,\" about the powers and perils of technology and the government's role in stepping in when necessary.\n\nMicrosoft did not respond to a request for comment.", "description": "Brad Smith, a regular contributor to Democrats, just wrote his biggest check of the year to support the speaker of the House.", "authors": ["Ari Levy"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105239744-REC_ASA_CODE18-20180529-154647-9849-XL.jpg?v=1527696898", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
