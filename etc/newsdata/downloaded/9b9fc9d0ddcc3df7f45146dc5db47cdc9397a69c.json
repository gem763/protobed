For his portrayal of Joker, Phoenix is receiving praises.\n\nHis heartbreaking yet haunting laugh from the film is impressive. Just to jog your memory a little, Arthur Fleck suffers from the Pseudobulbar Affect, a mental disorder that causes him to laugh uncontrollably. No matter what the critics or fans says, validation has come in an unexpected yet important way from Scott Lotan.\n\nFor Scott Lotan, the pseudobulbar affect, or PBA, is a symptom of his multiple sclerosis.\n\nDon't Miss 139 SHARES 152 SHARES 4.5 K SHARES 1.1 K SHARES\n\nJust like Arthur Fleck, the disorder causes Mr. Lotan to break into uncontrollable fits of laughter that can last up to 10 minutes. Talking LADbible, he admitted that this disorder often lands him in uncomfortable situations.\n\n\"I have had issues with not being served at restaurants and been asked to leave because waitstaff were uncomfortable. Many times if I am out for a drink with friends, there is someone with low self-esteem that believes I am laughing at them and they will try and start a fight.\"\n\nHe went on to reveal how this also lands him up in frequent problems. He added,\n\n\"We were leaving my engagement party and were hit by a drunk driver. My fianc\u00e9e died at the scene with my mother's death three days later. I remember being at the scene laughing and being questioned by police. At the wakes for both my mother and my fianc\u00e9e I would have to separate myself from everyone as I would burst into laughter at times.\"\n\nAfter watching Joker, Mr. Lotan is not just happy that this little-known disorder is now a matter of discussion, thanks to the film but he has also given a big thumps up to Phoenix's performance. He added,\n\n\"I think he did a great job of capturing the inability to stop laughing no matter what the circumstances are. I felt as if he experienced a deep sense of rejection in the bus scene, similar to how I felt during the days of my accident. It weighs heavy on the mind, people just look at you. You try and explain but they have preconceived notions that you are a drug addict or just a deranged lunatic. I think he captured the feeling of isolation and frustration with the lack of understanding from others. At times during the film I felt as though I was looking at a reflection of myself.\"\n\nWell, no one can ever doubt Joaquin's acting caliber and this validation just seals the deal!", "description": "His heartbreaking yet haunting laugh from the film is impressive.
