The statement added: 'I want to reiterate that Nike has always tried to put the athlete and their needs at the front of all our decisions.\n\nSalazar (centre) with Mo Farah (right) and Galen Rupp at the London 2012 Olympics\n\n'While the panel found there was no orchestrated doping, no finding that performance enhancing drugs have ever been used on Oregon Project athletes and went out of its way to note Alberto's desire to follow all rules, unfortunately, Alberto can no longer coach while the appeal is pending.\n\n'As we have said, we will continue to support Alberto in his appeal as a four-year suspension for someone who acted in good faith is wrong.'\n\nSalazar was banned for four years on October 1 after being found to have trafficked testosterone, attempted to tamper with the doping control process, and administration of a prohibited method of infusion. He is appealing.", "description": "Despite publicly standing by the coach who led Sir Mo Farah to four Olympic golds, Nike has responded to the backlash over the US Anti-Doping Agency findings by closing the set-up.", "authors": ["Riath Al-Samarrai For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/06/19134098-0-image-a-4_1570772203618.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
