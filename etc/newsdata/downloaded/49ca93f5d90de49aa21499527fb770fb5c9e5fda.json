So who should tackle Danielle Lloyd?\n\nGo home Kramer vs Kramer. Bog off Frost/Nixon. You want drama? You want glamour? You want the sheer white-knuckle thrill of watching one woman block her Instagram followers one by one? Then there\u2019s only one thing for it? The Coleen Rooney/Rebekah Vardy Wag Wars film.\n\nAnd it will. Sure, no script exists yet, and no director is attached. But in a press junket for her new film yesterday, Keira Knightley has thrown her hat into the ring for the role of Coleen Rooney.\n\nOK, that\u2019s a slight exaggeration. What actually happened was that, in attempting to keep up with the 500mph enthusiasm of a Heat reporter\u2019s recollection of the story, Knightley appeared to agree with the suggestion that she should play Coleen Rooney in a film. That is already enough.\n\nheat & heatworld.com (@heatworld) .@NetflixUK please get a script over to Keira Knightley immediately to play @ColeenRoo#RooneyvVardy #WagathaChristie #ColeenRooney pic.twitter.com/Is3xlGbPCW\n\nKeira Knightley would be a perfect Coleen Rooney. Look me in the eye and tell me that you wouldn\u2019t pay to see one of our finest actors, burnished in the pedigree of a million period pieces, slathered in Ronseal with a nylon wig Velcroed to her head. Tell me you wouldn\u2019t watch an epic psychodrama where she plays a woman trapped in a vast McMansion with only her four children for company, watching her self-esteem erode as her husband plays away, before finally discovering her talent as a private investigator. Of course you would. I\u2019d watch Keira Knightley in anything, but I promise that I would watch the absolute crap out of her in this.\n\nThe idea of Wag Wars film immediately sounds like a low-rent, trashy, Footballers\u2019 Wives-type production. But Knightley\u2019s commitment changes everything. Now this is a prestige picture, and it deserves the highest calibre of acting talent. Here\u2019s how I suggest casting the rest of the film.\n\nWhoever hacked Rebekah Vardy\u2019s Insta was obviously never at Baden-Baden Read more\n\nRebekah Vardy\n\nColeen\u2019s arch enemy. Older than Rooney but newer to the wag game, Vardy undergoes a downfall that is nothing less than operatic. We need an actor with the range to flit between victim and antagonist at a moment\u2019s notice, who can lash out with theatrical abandon at everyone and everything as the walls cave in around her. We need someone whose beauty is cut through with a thick streak of psychic darkness. In short, we need Rachel Weisz.\n\nWayne Rooney\n\nLow and grunting, Wayne Rooney should have been Coleen\u2019s rock throughout this scandal. But his refusal to even so much as like her tweet demonstrates a man who is surly and aloof, an old-fashioned man\u2019s man. We need an actor who can at once epitomise the latent anger that goes into posting a tweet such as \u201cI\u2019ll put u asleep within 10 seconds u little girl. Don\u2019t say stuff and not follow up on it. I\u2019ll be waiting\u201d and the stupidity to then send that tweet to himself. As such, I recommend Benedict Cumberbatch.\n\nJamie Vardy\n\nCut Jamie Vardy open and you\u2019ll find the phrase \u201cChat shit get banged\u201d written through him like a stick of Brighton rock. A wiry athlete who seems to be a nanosecond away from headbutting someone to death, Vardy will need to be played by an actor who can inhabit both a roiling hostility and a naive marital devotion that will soon be tested to its limit. Jamie Vardy should be played by Eddie Redmayne.\n\nDanielle Lloyd\n\nJust as the tremors from Rooney\u2019s tweet were starting to die down, who should pop up uninvited but Danielle Lloyd, a seasoned establishment wag. Danielle Lloyd is a key role here, for she will come to represent the swell of ill feeling for Rebekah Vardy in the wag community. She is this film\u2019s Greek chorus, passing violently disdainful comment from afar. She also has an OnlyFans page. She should therefore be played by Tilda Swinton.\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nThe end of this film will come when Victoria Beckham, grande dame of wags, decides enough is enough. She gathers together Rooney and Vardy and haughtily reminds them that wags symbolise something greater than themselves. She tells them of their higher moral purpose. Through sheer power of personality, she brokers an uneasy truce ready to be shattered in the sequel. There is no better Victoria Beckham than Joan Collins.", "description": "The public fallout was a slow-burn psychodrama of deceit and betrayal, ideal for the big screen \u2013 as Knightley has confirmed.
