Bernie on the attack, these people believe, is the strongest Bernie.\n\nSanders himself has often been resistant to this brand of direction, and as he demurred on obvious chances to go straight after rivals in debates and at rallies in recent months, this group has often bristled, impatient for the real contrasts to finally surface. Their level of agitation has only risen as a national narrative recently emerged about Elizabeth Warren\u2019s rise in the race, and about the idea that she is becoming Joe Biden\u2019s primary rival. To many of these Sanders allies \u2014 who have never made up his whole team, but who have nonetheless been vocal \u2014 his unwillingness to force a made-for-TV moment on stage has been both classic Bernie and frustrating, as the race matures.\n\nOn Thursday night, though, Sanders conceded: The time has come to force his issues.\n\nSanders ultimately spoke less than Biden, Warren, and even Cory Booker, but, at least by the NBC News tracker\u2019s count, he launched the most attacks of anyone on stage, most prominently in his repeat call-outs of Biden.\n\nMost of the substance of the contrasts was unsurprising \u2014 the entire Medicare for All exchange, for one, followed familiar patterns from previous debates, and indeed much of Sanders\u2019s career \u2014 but as the health-care conversation progressed and his signature issue came under sustained fire, he grew heated, at one point waving down the moderators to make sure he could defend the policy from Biden\u2019s attacks. Later, Sanders refused to smile as he took his turn at the mic after Kamala Harris jokingly compared Donald Trump to the Wizard of Oz, and instead performed a hard pivot, taking the former vice president to task on trade. \u201cThere is a reason why in the last 45 years the average American today, despite an explosion of technology and worker productivity, is not making a penny more than he or she made 45 years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd one of the reasons is that, for decades, we have had disastrous trade policies. I got to say to my good friend Joe Biden, Joe and I strongly disagree on trade.\u201d And when later asked about Afghanistan, Sanders again revealed his clear intention to take Biden on, talking instead about Iraq. \u201cThe truth is, the big mistake, the huge mistake, and one of the big differences between you and me: I never believed what Cheney and Bush said about Iraq,\u201d he said.\n\nThe strategic imperative to execute this turn now is clear. As Bill Press, the progressive radio host who hosted one of the first Bernie 2016 planning meetings in his home years ago, explained in the spin room after the debate, Sanders\u2019s \u201cchallenge is not so much from Joe Biden, it\u2019s from Elizabeth Warren. From the outside it looks like if he was losing ground, it\u2019s in that progressive lane. He had to show people, \u2018Look, I\u2019m the real deal here. I was there in 2016, I\u2019m here in 2020, stronger than ever, and don\u2019t think about abandoning me and going with her.\u2019\u201d\n\nA big part of doing that is positioning himself as Biden\u2019s biggest rival, not as simply one of the top three candidates. Sanders hasn\u2019t felt pressure to make that case yet, but now he knows he has no choice but to solidify his own base, then try again to expand his base of support.\n\nAnd it\u2019s clear he believes that means attacking Biden, specifically, not any of his other rivals \u2014 at one point he pointed out he was the only person on stage to vote against all of Trump\u2019s military budgets, but that only implicitly hit his fellow senators Warren, Harris, and Amy Klobuchar. He never used their names. \u201cBiden is the front-runner, I think he\u2019s kinda a weak front-runner at this time. But there\u2019s still a number of working class voters who are supporting Joe Biden,\u201d said Jeff Weaver, a senior Sanders advisor for years, pointing out this was the first time all the top candidates were on stage together, and potentially the last time for a few more months, since October\u2019s debate will likely be split into two stages again. To one former Sanders aide who worked closely with him on debate prep in 2016, the candidate now appeared to be far more comfortable drawing these contrasts than he had early in the last cycle.\n\nBut, as always with Sanders, the question is whether the attacks \u2014 so classic in their content, and therefore so unlikely to surprise many viewers (who already know both he and Biden well) \u2014 will shift the political ground. \u201cDid it change anything?,\u201d the former aide asked, genuinely unsure.\n\nSanders is betting the answer is yes, or that it\u2019s at least a question he must test now, seven months into his run. \u201cThese races evolve, and every day we get closer to the time of people voting. We\u2019re still, actually, quite far away from that,\u201d said Weaver. \u201cBut it is time.\u201d", "description": "Onstage during the third Democratic debate in Houston, Bernie Sanders started calling out Joe Biden for his record, appeasing advisors who have suggested that he push his signature issues more aggressively on the campaign trail.", "authors": ["Gabriel Debenedetti"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/12/Biden_Sanders.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
