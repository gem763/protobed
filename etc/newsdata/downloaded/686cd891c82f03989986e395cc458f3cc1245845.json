Trump\u2019s personal attorney to investigate the president\u2019s rivals.\n\nTrump\u2019s attorney, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, said in May that he planned to visit then-incoming Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to win support for probes into potentially damaging claims raised by senior Ukrainian officials.\n\nAmong them was the misleading contention that Trump\u2019s main 2020 Democratic rival, Joe Biden, improperly pressured Ukraine\u2019s government to fire a top prosecutor; that American diplomats in Ukraine had exhibited pro-Democrat bias; and that local officials conspired to undermine Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and help Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nGiuliani set off a firestorm in the conservative media by promoting the allegations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not meddling in an election; we\u2019re meddling in an investigation, which we have a right to do,\u201d he told the New York Times.\n\nThe claims he was pressing have since largely been debunked, but remain politically potent as the next U.S. elections approach.\n\nIgor Fruman with U.S. President Donald J.

His efforts in Ukraine, however, have continued.\n\nAt the center of Giuliani\u2019s back-channel diplomacy are the two businessmen, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who Giuliani has publicly identified as his clients.\n\nUntil now, the men have escaped detailed scrutiny. But a joint investigation by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and BuzzFeed News, based on interviews and court and business records in the United States and Ukraine, has uncovered new information that raises questions about their influence on U.S. political figures.\n\nBoth men were born in the Soviet Union and immigrated to the United States. Parnas came with his family at the age of four. Fruman first arrived as a young adult in the 1980s, but later moved to Ukraine and established a series of businesses. Both now live in South Florida.\n\nSince late 2018, the men have introduced Giuliani to three current and former senior Ukrainian prosecutors to discuss the politically damaging information.\n\nThe effort has involved meetings in at least five countries, stretching from Washington, D.C. to the Israeli office of a Ukrainian oligarch accused of a multi-billion dollar fraud, and to the halls of the French Senate.\n\nParnas and Fruman\u2019s work with Giuliani has been just one facet of their political activity.\n\nFormer New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani.

They have collectively contributed over half a million dollars to candidates and outside campaign groups, the lion\u2019s share in a single transaction that an independent watchdog has flagged as a potential violation of electoral funding law.\n\nThe men appear to enjoy a measure of access to influential figures. They\u2019ve dined with Trump, had a \u201cpower breakfast\u201d with his son Donald Jr., met with U.S. congressmen, and mixed with Republican elites.\n\nMonths before their earliest known work with Giuliani, Parnas and Fruman also lobbied at least one congressman \u2014 former U.S. Rep. Pete Sessions, a Texas Republican \u2014 to call for the dismissal of the United States\u2019 ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch. She stepped down a year later after allegations in the conservative media that she had been disloyal to Trump.\n\nWhile setting up meetings for Giuliani with Ukrainian officials, the men also promoted a business plan of their own: Selling American liquefied natural gas to Ukraine to replace Russian imports disrupted by war.\n\nIn a series of interviews, Parnas said he and Fruman weren\u2019t paid by anyone for their work in Ukraine and that he and his partner have done nothing illegal.\n\nParnas and Fruman meet with the president\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr., and Republican fundraiser Tommy Hicks Jr. in Beverly Hills in May 2018.

I felt it was my duty to pass it on.\u201d\n\nHe said their political activities were motivated by sincere conviction that they had uncovered wrongdoing that should be investigated.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re American citizens, we love our country, we love our president,\u201dhe said.\n\nThe men make for unlikely back-channel diplomats. Parnas, 47, is a former stockbroker with a history of unpaid debts, including half a million dollars owed to a Hollywood movie investor. Fruman, 53, has spent much of his career in Ukraine, and has ties to a powerful local businessman reputed to be in the inner circle of one of the country\u2019s most infamous mafia groups.\n\nGiuliani and Fruman didn\u2019t respond to multiple requests for interviews or to written questions. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nKenneth McCallion, an ex-federal prosecutor who has represented former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yuliya Tymoshenko in U.S. court, said that Parnas and Fruman were \u201cplaying with fire\u201d by lobbying in the United States and Ukraine without registering as foreign agents.\n\n\u201cTrump has either authorized Giuliani to engage in private diplomacy and deal-making, or even worse, remains silent while Giuliani and his dodgy band of soldiers of fortune engage in activities that severely undermine U.S. credibility and are contrary to fundamental U.S. interests,\u201d McCallion said.\n\n\u2018It Opened Giuliani\u2019s Eyes\u2019\n\nParnas and Fruman\u2019s work with Giuliani has largely centered on efforts to connect the president\u2019s personal attorney with current and former senior Ukrainian prosecutors believed to hold information harmful to Trump\u2019s rivals.\n\nIn late 2018, Parnas and Fruman organized a Skype call between Giuliani and Viktor Shokin, who served as Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general until he was dismissed by parliament in 2016 amid allegations he was blocking anti-corruption efforts.\n\nParnas and Giuliani visited the French Senate building, where Giuliani attended a meeting that included Nazar Kholodnitsky, the head of Ukraine\u2019s Special Anti-Corruption Prosecutor\u2019s Office, according to social media posts and interviews. (Kholodnitsky has faced calls to step down after wiretaps in his office last year allegedly caught him interfering in corruption cases.)\n\nBy the new year, Parnas said, he and Fruman had also connected Giuliani with Shokin\u2019s replacement as top prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko. The Ukrainian official and Giuliani met in New York in January and again in Warsaw the following month.\n\n\u201c[Lutsenko] brought documentation, verification. It opened Giuliani\u2019s eyes,\u201d Parnas said.\n\n\ud83d\udd17\u201cThe Weather and General Issues\u201d On May 21, following President Zelensky\u2019s inauguration, Giuliani joined Parnas for another discussion that Parnas said included allegations of pro-Clinton interference by Ukrainian officials. Parnas and Giulani visited the French Senate building, where Giuliani attended a meeting that included Nazar Kholodnitsky, the head of Ukraine\u2019s Special Anti-Corruption Prosecutor\u2019s Office, according to social media posts and interviews. (Kholodnitsky has faced calls to step down after wiretaps in his office last year allegedly caught him interfering in corruption cases.) Kholodnitsky said his encounter with Giuliani was \u201cprobably a coincidence.\u201d \u201cI recognized his face, but I couldn\u2019t identify who he was [at first],\u201d Kholodnitsky said. \u201cTo communicate with such a person about the weather and general issues was an honor for me.\u201d Show Hide\n\nShortly after their February meeting in Poland, both Lutsenko and Giuliani began airing a series of allegations in the U.S. media.\n\nIn March and April, the online publication The Hill published a series of opinion pieces largely based on an interview with Lutsenko. The articles relayed the allegations about the Bidens, and went further.\n\nLutsenko also claimed that officials at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv had worked with Ukrainian law enforcement to interfere in the 2016 U.S. election by coordinating the disclosure of the so-called \u201cblack ledger,\u201d a document that appeared to detail millions of dollars in secret payments from Ukraine\u2019s former ruling party to Paul Manafort, then Trump\u2019s campaign manager. Some of those payments were later verified to be real.\n\nThe revelation of the black ledger in 2016 contributed to Manafort\u2019s resignation from the Trump campaign, and helped lead to his prosecution and conviction by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Since then, prominent Trump supporters have used allegations that the ledger\u2019s disclosure was motivated by anti-Trump bias to cast doubt on the origins of Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nUkrainian General Prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko.

The Hill characterized the claim as evidence that Yovanovitch was favoring Democrats in the middle of a presidential election because the purported list contained the names of supposed Democrat allies in Ukraine\u2019s parliament and civil society groups.\n\nThe State Department has forcefully rejected the claims. In a statement, the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv told reporters: \u201cThe allegation of a \u2018do not prosecute\u2019 list is an outright fabrication. Such allegations only help the corrupt.\u201d\n\nStill, the allegations caught like wildfire in U.S. conservative media, and were amplified by Giuliani in a series of interviews with cable news and newspapers.\n\nTrump called claims that Ukrainian officials had helped Clinton\u2019s candidacy \u201cbig\u201d and \u201cincredible\u201d in an April interview with Fox News, and said that he would leave it to Attorney General William Barr to decide whether to look into them. Barr announced a probe into the origins of the Mueller investigation \u2014 in which Manafort\u2019s Ukrainian work became a focus \u2014 the following month.\n\nParnas said he expected all the information he and Fruman had helped advance to become an important part of Barr\u2019s inquiry, and that it would dominate the debate in the run-up to the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all going to come out,\u201d he said. \u201cSomething terrible happened and we\u2019re finally going to get to the bottom of it.\u201d\n\nDebunked But Not Dead\n\nExperts have largely dismissed most of the allegations raised by the prosecutors and relayed by Giuliani as being at best unfounded, and at worst deliberate disinformation.\n\nBoth Shokin and Lutsenko are widely viewed among Ukrainian reformers as lacking credibility, and civil society groups have accused them of covering for suspects in major corruption cases.\n\nJoe Biden had indeed pushed for Shokin\u2019s dismissal, threatening that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees if he remained.\n\n\u201cI looked at them and said: \u2018I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money,\u2019\u201d Biden recounted in a 2018 speech at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cWell, son of a bitch. He got fired.\u201d\n\nHowever, Biden was not alone in his disdain for Shokin. The former top prosecutor was dismissed by parliament after a chorus of criticism by European diplomats and international organizations, and even street protests calling for his resignation.\n\nLocal anti-corruption activists had become convinced Shokin was quashing investigations into Burisma\u2019s owner, Mykola Zlochevsky, and other oligarchs, said Daria Kaleniuk, the director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, a Ukrainian transparency group.\n\n\u201cShokin was not dismissed because he wanted to investigate Burisma,\u201d Kaleniuk said. \u201cQuite the contrary. He was dismissed because of a lack of willingness to investigate this particular case as well as other important cases involving high-level associates of [ousted former President Viktor] Yanukovych.\u201d\n\nAs for Lutsenko, Kaleniuk said his claims were likely motivated by a desire to hold on to his job as top prosecutor with the incoming Zelensky administration, as well as to find friends in the United States government, where he has long been viewed as toxic.\n\n\u201cHe wanted to become a person with whom people in the United States wanted to talk, and then probably he found Giuliani and found a sexy story that fit into the Giuliani agenda,\u201d Kaleniuk said.\n\nHunter Biden\u2019s work for Burisma, however, still raises eyebrows in Ukraine. The younger Biden\u2019s paid tenure on Burisma\u2019s board came at a time the company and its owner faced multiple corruption investigations. He was likely hired simply to impart his famous last name, Kaleniuk said.\n\n\u201cI think [working for Burisma] was wrong from an ethical point of view,\u201d she said.\n\nIn a statement, Hunter Biden defended his previous position on Burisma\u2019s board, saying he worked to help reform the company\u2019s \u201cpractices of transparency, corporate governance and responsibility.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt no time have I discussed with my father the company\u2019s business, or my board service. Any suggestion to the contrary is just plain wrong,\u201d Biden said.\n\nThere is also no known documentary evidence that U.S. officials had worked with Ukrainians to release the black ledger.\n\nThough Giuliani\u2019s visit was canceled and many of his claims debunked, the allegations emerging from Ukraine remain very much alive in the lead-up to the 2020 U.S. election.\n\nThe accusation that Yovanovitch had exhibited political bias was reported to be behind her stepping down as ambassador in May.\n\nLutsenko and Shokin did not respond to requests for interviews. Reporters were unable to reach Yovanovitch.\n\nFrom the Black Sea to Boca\n\nThe previous business dealings of both Parnas and Fruman raise serious concerns about their newfound access to senior American political figures.\n\nA resident of upscale Boca Raton, Parnas once ran an electronics business that was successfully sued for its role in a fraudulent penny stock promotion scheme. He has also worked for three brokerages that later lost their licenses for fraud and other violations. He has never been personally charged.\n\nCourt records also show that judges have awarded a series of default judgements against Parnas for multiple unpaid debts. These include over $500,000 he owes to an investor in a Hollywood movie that he had promoted but was never made. He has also been sued a dozen times over the last decade for failing to pay rent on various Palm Beach County properties and has been evicted from two homes.\n\nFruman\u2019s backstory is even more colorful.", "description": "Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor now working as U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney, has taken the search for damaging information on Trump\u2019s rivals all the way to Ukraine....", "authors": ["Aubrey Belford", "Veronika Melkozerova"], "top_image": "https://www.occrp.org/assets/investigations/Rudy-Giuliani.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-22"}
