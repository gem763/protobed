Aided by nongovernmental organizations like the Humanitarian Dialogue, they are doing what outsider powers have so far failed to do in coming up with a realistic agenda for the country of six million, eight years after the overthrow of Muammar Qaddafi left it in chaos. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization had a major hand in that operation to depose the former strongman, while outside powers in Europe and the Middle East continue to do more harm than good today, since they support opposing actors within Libya, stoking more conflict and instability.\n\nFor its part, the United States under President Trump Donald John TrumpBusiness school deans call for lifting country-specific visa caps Bolton told ex-Trump aide to call White House lawyers about Ukraine pressure campaign: report Federal prosecutors in New York examining Giuliani business dealings with Ukraine: report MORE oscillates between supporting the \u201cGovernment of National Accord\u201d under Prime Minister Fayez Sarraj, which is anything but that, though it does at least have U.N. backing, and the forces of eastern strongman General Hiftar and his equally misnamed Libyan National Army. European countries including Italy, France and now Germany meanwhile attempt to organize grand national conferences on Libya within their own countries, but such convenings wind up more like boondoggles than serious attempts at conflict resolution.\n\nWhat is needed in Libya, by contrast, is a realistic model for governance and security that builds on current realities on the ground. Focusing too much on the central government, such as it is, or the would-be central government of Hiftar, such as he would have it, will not work. Nor will a regional approach that creates a Bosnia-like system of autonomous areas based on Libya's three traditional sub-entities. Rather, the action should be at the city level. That is where the meaningful action has in fact been for years, as a combination of brave Libyan patriots and dedicated foreign assistance workers have kept the country somewhat afloat by doing what they can one town or city at a time. A new framework for Libya should seek to harness this local energy and governance, formalize it, and take it to the next level of effectiveness. That is the best way to help Libyans. It is also the best way to protect other countries from problems of mass migration and/or terrorism that have at times emanated from Libya since 2011.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nStarting this spring, Libya's recent tradition of numerous militia battles has coalesced into a fight between the two main groups noted above. Serraj's forces have strengthened and come together in the face of an acute threat posed by Hiftar, such that a stalemate in and around Tripoli has resulted. Hiftar's spring offensive gained strength by taking advantage of the disaffection of many in the south with their meager share of oil revenues being provided by the Government of National Accord. His efforts to portray all his opponents as Islamist extremists persuaded President Trump to lend him rhetorical support in the spring. Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Russia provide him material support, with most parties effectively ignoring the U.N. arms embargo.\n\nWhat can be done? Here is what we propose, building on a Brookings-led report, \u201cEmpowered Decentralization,\u201d to which we contributed in the winter. First, outside powers should pressure Hiftar to pull back forces from Tripoli. They should also enforce the UN arms embargo. There is an opportunity here for Saudi Arabia and other supporters of Hiftar to improve their international reputations with such an effort at peace.\n\nSecond, the focus of outside assistance, and internal Libyan governance, should shift to local municipalities. This approach recognizes that the most effective political unit currently is Libya's cities, more so than the national government or three main historical regions--as recent dialogues involving dozens of the country's mayors and other local leaders have recently proven.\n\nThird, this approach requires a fair distribution of oil revenues and aid flows to major municipalities in Libya provided they used those funds effectively and transparently, with oversight provided by a board composed of Libyans and technocratic foreigners so as to inspire confidence and trust. This approach has considerable promise in Libya. The country has significant oil supplies and therefore wealth. And while Libyan militias and political actors do sometimes have tribal proclivities, they generally lack the kind of toxic ideological or sectarian motivations that worsen cycles of violence in much of the region. They are driven more by competition for their share of the state\u2019s wealth, as well as control of the neighborhoods and cities that matter most to them. There are good reasons to think they can be incentivized to cooperate, since doing so is in their financial self-interest.\n\nFinally, the prospects for such a strategy would also be enhanced by the authorization and deployment of a U.N.-approved observation force, assuming a request for such a force had been issued by key Libyan actors. Given Libyan national pride and patriotism, that force should have a narrow mandate focused on protection of specific assets, institutions, and locations, and monitoring of the agreed pullback of forces and ceasefire accord.\n\nBecause today's situation in Libya seems so hopeless, little thought is being given to how the crisis of 2019 might in fact be turned into an opportunity. Nothing is guaranteed, of course, and ultimately Libyans will have to be willing to take the brave steps necessary for such a strategy to have a chance. But there is now a realistic chance for peace.\n\nMichael O\u2019Hanlon and Federica Saini Fanasotti are scholars at the Brookings Institution.", "description": "While world leaders remain confused and divided and, most of all, usually indifferent over the future of Libya, its municipal leaders continue to point the way forward.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/libya_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
