(@MillionaireUK) October 20, 2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also appeared to drop a hint about where he would be headed for his day job, season four of The Grand Tour.\n\nSpeaking to contestant Erica Roberts, Jeremy mentioned that he would be heading off on a holiday when she had to answer the question: \u2018Khmer is the official language of which country \u2013 Laos, Bhutan, Malaysia or Cambodia?\u2019\n\nHaving used up her ask the audience lifeline and unsure if her friends would know the answer, she turned to Jeremy.\n\nThe presenter explained: \u2018Here\u2019s what I think. Earlier this year I spent two or three months in south east Asia. Not Bhutan. I will be going to Bhutan in about six months.\n\n\u2018Where have I been in the world? Literally everywhere is the answer to that, including Cambodia \u2013 I think on five occasions \u2013 where the official language is Khmer.\u2019\n\nWhile his answer was of course incredibly helpful to Erica, the part about travelling to Bhutan six months after the episode was recorded could mean that\u2019s where he, Richard Hammond and James May were headed to shoot new episodes of The Grand Tour.\n\nFilming on the new season has also taken place in both Cambodia and Vietnam.\n\nThe show itself aired either side of an ITV documentary about Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle the Duchess of Sussex.\n\nWho Wants To Be A Millionaire will return to ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
