I guess a part of you hopes your body will work in weird and wonderful ways and it will all work out.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThree months later, the couple were left even more heartbroken when Cli discovered her father was dying of mouth and throat cancer.\n\nCli and her dad, Jim (Picture: PA Real Life/Collect)\n\nShe continued: \u2018I remember thinking that if I could get pregnant, a grandchild would give my dad so much more to fight for.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s when I knew we had to try IVF again.\u2019\n\nThey managed to scrape together another \u00a313,000 but this time the opted to go to fertility clinic, Sims IVF, in Dublin, in the Republic of Ireland, after hearing of friends who had twins after going there.\n\nIn February 2017, they went through the now all too familiar IVF process once again.\n\nSadly, it was unsuccessful for the third time and they decided to give up on their dream of becoming parents.\n\n\u2018It was hard,\u2019 Cli said. \u2018Every time we\u2019d see a child on the street we\u2019d cry. We ended up drowning our sorrows a fair few times.\u2019\n\nJust two months after their third failed IVF attempt, Cli was left heartbroken again when her father passed away from cancer on April 23, 2017.\n\nAndy, Cli and Jesse (Picture: PA Real Life/Collect)\n\n\u2018I told him about the failed IVF and he was really upset,\u2019 she said. \u2018He was so determined he would do whatever it took for us to have our baby.\u2019\n\nAnd Jim managed to help even after he had died, leaving his daughter \u00a315,000 specifically for one last shot at IVF.\n\nSo, in November 2017, following a much-needed break in Bali for two weeks, Cli and Andy returned to Sims IVF to start the treatment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe said: \u2018The clinic suggested using a sperm donor as a back-up plan this time.\n\n\u2018They also suggested Andy go on a course of Proceive fertility supplements to boost his sperm count.\u2019\n\nThree months later, in February 2018, doctors fertilised five of Cli\u2019s eggs \u2013 three from donor sperm and two from Andy\u2019s sperm.\n\nAnd, following further tests, they found the embryo fertilised with Andy\u2019s sperm was the most viable, so this was the one they used to proceed.\n\nThis time, during the dreaded two week wait for news, Cli was certain the pregnancy would take, saying: \u2018I just knew that Dad would not allow me not to fall pregnant.\n\n\u2018I was so confident this time around that I bought two balloons for my mum and Andy\u2019s mum that Mother\u2019s Day \u2013 which said, \u201cYou\u2019re going to be a grandmother,\u201d on it.\u2019\n\nAmazingly, on Mother\u2019s Day March 11 last year, Cli and Andy found out she was pregnant.\n\n\u2018I got up at 5 am and I did the test and it said it was inconclusive and I told Andy, \u2018she said.\n\nBaby Jesse (Picture: PA Real Life/Collect)\n\n\u2018I told him it hadn\u2019t worked but he wouldn\u2019t believe it and 10 minutes later I did another test and it showed the same thing.\n\n\u2018But then Andy had another look and it had worked, as soon as he told me we burst into tears, jumping up and down on the bed.\n\n\u2018It was so early in the morning we couldn\u2019t even tell our nearest and dearest but that one moment \u2013 seeing it positive \u2013 blew our minds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It was absolutely amazing and we were so happy.\u2019\n\nAnd on October 10, 2018, Jesse was born by emergency C-section, after Cli\u2019s waters broke five and a half weeks early, at Ulster Hospital, in County Down, Northern Ireland.\n\n\u2018We were a bit worried as he was a few weeks premature, but he was born fit and healthy,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been brilliant ever since and there have been no issues whatsoever.\n\n\u2018I know I\u2019ve got to say this but he really is fantastic. He\u2019s the most gorgeous boy.\u2019\n\nNow, Jesse is one and Cli has returned to work but the couple have decided not to have IVF for any more children.\n\nDiscussing further IVF treatment down the line, she said: \u2018I couldn\u2019t put myself through all that again.\n\n\u2018If I fell pregnant naturally that would be brilliant, but I know that is virtually impossible.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve been through so much to get where we are now but I wouldn\u2019t change a thing.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s all thanks to my wonderful dad\u2019s generosity that I\u2019m a mum and every time I look at Jesse, I know how proud he\u2019d be. Every moment of effort has been more than worth it!\u2019\n\nMORE: Would you buy this \u00a360,000 belt made of platinum, gold, and diamonds?\n\nMORE: Asda is selling an advent calendar filled with mini bottles of Baileys for \u00a320\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Cli and Andy, from Belfast, Northern Ireland, became parents to Jesse after her dad Jim left them \u00a315,000 when he died from cancer.", "authors": ["Laura Abernethy"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_93601878_1572354929.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
