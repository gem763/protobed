People have now been warned to leave Trafalgar Square, and \u2018anyone who fails to comply with the condition is liable for arrest and prosecution.\u2019\n\nDeputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor said: \u2018These conditions have been imposed due to the continued breaches of the section 14 condition previously implemented, and ongoing serious disruption to the community.\n\n\u2018We have made significant progress in managing Extinction Rebellion\u2019s activity at sites across central London over this past week.\n\nThis is a catastrophe. The few people brave enough to stand up to the fossil fuel giants, their lobby men & the government in their pockets are taken away in the dead of night by police breaking the law.

Obstructing a highway is a crime, peaceful protest is not. Civil disobedience is considered, Crimea are particular.
