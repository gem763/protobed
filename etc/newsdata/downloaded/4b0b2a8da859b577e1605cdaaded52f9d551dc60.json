The LDNPA should be taking the lead in the protection of natural beauty and the special qualities of the Lake District.\n\n\"Instead it needs to be cajoled into action when our landscape is being degraded by off-road motorists invading some of the most beautiful tracks in the country.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Lake District National Park Authority said: \"The two public roads are open to all users and make up just 0.09 per cent of our rights of way network. The overwhelming majority of people enjoying the national park\u2019s 3,280km of trails are highly unlikely to encounter recreational motorists on these routes.\n\n\u201cAs a national park representing everyone\u2019s right to enjoyment, the decision to restrict anyone\u2019s right to use these roads must not be taken lightly. In line with government guidance, legal intervention through a TRO is a last resort and we should explore other management options first.\n\n\"We have completed a comprehensive evidence gathering exercise and the findings will be presented to our Rights of Way Committee on 8 October where Members will decide on the future management of these roads and whether or not we should consult formally on the creation of a Traffic Regulation Order.\"", "description": "Lake District admirers have criticised a \"breathtakingly biased\" report which they claim downplays the damage caused by 4x4s churning up land once owned by Beatrix Potter.", "authors": ["Mike Glover", "Phoebe Southworth", "David Trimble", "Roderick Crawford", "Stephen Barclay"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/04/TELEMMGLPICT000211878987-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqfzOMAl0Xij9hZ3C3ekNETZp-Uhuu7_2Vegw4QhUu4Vk.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
