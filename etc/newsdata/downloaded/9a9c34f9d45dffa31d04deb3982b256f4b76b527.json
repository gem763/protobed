The first piece of fake news that might eventually become true.\"\n\nWhat are deepfakes?\n\n\"A deepfake is a way of essentially doing a face swap, making someone look like they say something they didn\u2019t,\u2019\u2019 Sam Gregory, an expert on deepfakes and Program Director of non-profit Witness, which promotes the use of video to defend human rights, told Euronews.\n\nClips with manipulated audio and visuals, deepfakes use an artificial intelligence technique called machine learning, which make alternative realities easier to create and share.\n\nThe most commonly circulated deepfakes are pornographic and politically motivated, and are on the rise.\n\nResearch from cyber-security company Deeptrace released this week found there were 14,698 deepfake videos online, compared to 7,964 in December 2018.\n\nThe report said 96% were pornographic, often with a computer-generated face of a celebrity replacing that of an adult actor in a scene of a sexual nature.\n\nAhead of the 2020 US election, steps are being taken to combat deepfakes amid growing concerns over how they could influence voters\n\nLast week, California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, signed legislation making it illegal to create or distribute videos, images, or audio of politicians doctored to resemble real footage within 60 days of an election.\n\nShould deepfakes be used by a charity?\n\nGregory told Euronews: \"The reality is, most deepfakes are used maliciously, they\u2019re used to target women, and are increasingly likely to disrupt our societies.\n\n\"I think we need to discuss the ethics of using deep fakes \u2014 this certainly isn\u2019t the first deepfake used by a charity or political group.\"\n\nEarlier this year, charity Malaria Must Die used deepfake technology to manipulate David Beckham\u2019s voice to deliver an appeal to end malaria in nine languages.\n\nHowever, there is a clear difference between the two deepfakes: Beckham gave consent, whereas Solidarit\u00e9 Sida\u2019s deepfake is self-proclaimed \u2018\u2019fake news\u2019\u2019.\n\n\"The question of whether people should be using deepfakes for good, as in this context, is something we need to discuss,\" said Gregory.\n\nWhat responsibility do platforms have?\n\nGregory highlighted that the deepfake video of Trump \"clearly names itself as satire it\u2019s also pretty clear it\u2019s a fake, it\u2019s not a completely convincing deepfake\u2019\u2019.\n\nBut it raises the question of how social media companies should moderate deepfakes and whether satire is be allowed.\n\n\"One of the big questions for platforms is how they should label things if they do share them.\n\n\"This one says halfway through it\u2019s a deepfake, but should platforms really affirmatively be telling people, given that as this technology gets better, we may not be able to see it in the way we can with this one,\" Gregory said.\n\nThe expert said he thinks social media companies have a responsibility \"to tell us what is a deep fake, or what is one of these other manipulations, maybe a manipulation of the lips or audio.\n\n\"They are very well placed to do that, because they will see these deepfakes passing through their systems.\n\n\"So it\u2019s really important they develop detection techniques that are going to be available for ordinary people to be able to see signals of manipulation that might be invisible to naked eye or ear.\n\n\"There are some encouraging early signs of that \u2014 companies like Facebook are investing in making training data more available, we need to see more of that, the building of a shared immune system of detection.\"", "description": "A deepfake video developed by French charity Solidarit\u00e9 Sida features US President Donald Trump saying ''AIDS is over''.
