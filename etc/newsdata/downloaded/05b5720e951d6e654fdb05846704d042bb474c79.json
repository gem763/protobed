Mark Zuckerberg doesn't disagree", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE When Facebook went public several years ago, CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg instantly became one of the richest people on the planet. Like an increasing number of the hyper-rich, he's promising to do something useful with all that wealth? USA TODAY\n\nWhen a software engineer employed by Facebook asked billionaire Mark Zuckerberg to comment on Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders' position that billionaires should not exist, fellow employees began to laugh.\n\nFacebook CEO and co-founder Zuckerberg also chuckled after a moment's pause. Those in attendance at Thursday's live-streamed town hall-style internal meeting began supportively to applaud.\n\n\"It's a good question ... Alright,\" Zuckerberg said.\n\nIn the answer that followed, Zuckerberg \u2013 who, with a net worth of $67 billion, is listed by Forbes as the fourth wealthiest American \u2013 said he was sympathetic to Sanders' views on income inequality.\n\n\"I understand where he's coming from,\" he said, noting he couldn't put a threshold on how much wealth is too much.\n\n\"At some level, no one deserves to have that much money.\"\n\nHe went on to say he sees potential advantages to some Americans' ability to accumulate even \"unreasonable\" amounts of wealth, too.\n\nForbes 400: Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett remain the richest people in the US\n\nFacebook encryption: Here's why the government doesn't want Facebook to encrypt your messages\n\nHe cited his own philanthropic pledges as an example: Zuckerberg and wife Dr. Priscilla Chan have pledged to give away 99% of their Facebook shares in their lifetime.\n\nZuckerberg said that while critics might argue billionaires' charitable gifts would benefit the nation more as tax dollars, he says his philanthropy is funding scientific research projects that would likely be ignored by the government.\n\n\"I think the alternative would be the government chooses all of the funding for all of the stuff,\" he commented.\n\n\"Part of what makes progress happen is people taking different approaches to different things,\" he went on to say.\n\nThe exchange happened at a weekly \"internal Q&A\" that was publicly live-streamed on Zuckerberg's Facebook page. Usually the sessions are only for employees but a previous Q&A session made headlines this week when Zuckerberg was heard saying in leaked audio that he would \"go to the mat\" to fight efforts aimed at breaking up the social networking giant.\n\nThat sparked a response from another Democratic presidential hopeful: Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who defended her plan to break up big tech companies.\n\nZuckerberg was asked Thursday about Warren's plans and responded: \"Let's try not to antagonize her further.\"\n\nOn Friday, Warren tweeted a video clip of the question and the start of Zuckerberg's response.\n\nIf Facebook finds my scrutiny uncomfortable, here's what Mark Zuckerberg and his team could work on:\n\n\u2014Ending his company's illegal anticompetitive practices\n\n\u2014Protecting consumers' privacy instead of Facebook's profits\n\n\u2014Ensuring Facebook isn\u2019t undermining our election security pic.twitter.com/KPpuIYMcOf \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 5, 2019\n\n\"If Facebook finds my scrutiny uncomfortable, here's what Mark Zuckerberg and his team could work on,\" Warren tweeted, listing protecting consumers' privacy, ensuring Facebook \"isn\u2019t undermining our election security\" and ending \"his company's illegal anticompetitive practices.\"\n\nContributing: Kelly Tyko, Jessica Guynn, Brett Molina\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/10/04/mark-zuckerberg-weighs-bernie-sanders-attack-billionaires/3869852002/", "description": "The Facebook CEO offered a defense of philanthropy, but conceded \"no one deserves to have that much money.\"", "authors": ["Joel Shannon", "Published P.M.
