Just like this one of a dolphin who was found by a resident washed up on the shore of Times Beach in Davao, Philippines on Saturday morning.\n\nResident Judith Acido told ABS-CBN News that when the dolphin was discovered, it had wounds, did not have a tail, and was already reeking. Upon further inspection, Darrell Blatchley, an American marine biologist and President of natural museum D'Bone Collector, found that the dolphin was missing its internal organs.\n\nDue to its foul stench, residents believe the dolphin had been dead for a few days.\n\nBlatchley told reporters that the dolphin was a Risso's dolphin, a type of dolphin known scientifically as a grampus griseus, that prefers to swim in deep waters.\n\nBlatchley said that the injured dolphin could have been part of fishermen\u2019s catch and then eventually died.\n\nFishermen in the area aren\u2019t allowed to catch nor eat these types of mammals so it is possible that they chopped up and threw the mammal back into the sea.\n\nIt is illegal in the Philippines to catch dolphins for selling, purchasing, possessing, transporting, or exporting, whether dead or alive, in any state or form, whether raw or processed. In 2008, a fisherman in Davao City was arrested for killing a dolphin and trying to sell its meat to residents.\n\nBlatchley told VICE, \u201cin the fishing industry, it is normal for fishermen that when they catch something that they aren't allowed to, to cut up the marine life to hide it so it sinks in the sea, but as we can see, it still washed up on the beach.\"\n\nAccording to ABS-CBN News, this is the second Risso's dolphin found dead in Davao, and that other marine life in the area have also been victims of human negligence. Just in July, a pygmy sperm whale washed up on the shore in Davao City; its intestine contained a plastic cup and some nylon rope. In March, a Cuvier\u2019s beaked whale was found in Compostela Valley, which was discovered to have around 40 kg of plastic trash in its stomach.\n\nSince the opening of D\u2019Bone Collector Museum in Davao 10 years ago, it has recovered 68 dead whales and dolphins just from the Davao Gulf.\n\nEnvironmental groups are calling for a stop to this disregard for marine life.\n\nAnna Opposa, Executive Director of Save Philippine Seas told VICE: \"Dolphins are protected species in the Philippines, but there are still a lot of threats to their survival. This is clear in the recent incident. We need stricter enforcement of policies and clear marine animal interaction guidelines.\"", "description": "The animal\u2019s tail and internal organs were missing and it was covered with visible wounds.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5dad7674419dca0009b03613/lede/1571673571315-73370559_2318759001584899_4272451144699084800_n.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.75xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
