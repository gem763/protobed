The pass-on cost is not mandatory, but is permitted should a retailer elect to recover the cost from customers.\n\nThe RBA is now considering levelling the playing field for the emerging buy now, pay later system \u2013 popular with Millennials \u2013 as part of its broader review of card payment regulations, which takes place every five years.\n\nThe RBA will look into whether consumers are unwittingly bearing the cost of merchant charges and whether those who pay cash or use debit cards are cross-subsidising Afterpay users.\n\nA central bank inquiry about 15 years ago found some credit cards offered big rewards such as frequent flyer points.\n\nSome retailers were forced to pay much higher merchant fees on such high-reward cards \u2013 like American Express \u2013 often about 3 per cent.\n\nBy definition, the seller either had to suffer a lower profit or increase their prices across the board to cover the costs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, the RBA decided to remove this cross-subsidy by incentivising consumers to use lower-cost payment methods.\n\nIt did so by banning the \u201cno surcharge\u201d applied by Visa, Mastercard and American Express, and enabling the true cost to be paid by individual card users.\n\nThe RBA's modern-day investigation of Afterpay and other buy now, pay later operators will again revisit these issues.\n\nFor example, a retailer may sell a $100 jumper to an Afterpay consumer. Afterpay immediately pays the merchant $97 and bears the credit risk of collecting the $100 (a $3 margin) from the customer through four equal instalments due every fortnight.\n\nUBS estimates that Afterpay charges merchants a 30\u00a2 fixed transaction fee plus a commission on the sales value ranging between 3 per cent and 7 per cent.\n\nThe RBA never has and will not force stores to pass on surcharges.\n\nIt might find that merchants have a right to apply the surcharge, by potentially outlawing the \u201cno surcharge\u201d rule imposed by buy now, pay later providers.\n\nThe central bank's official review will run through 2020 and is at a preliminary stage.\n\nThe Reserve has strong powers to regulate the payments system and the participants. It does not necessarily need the blessing of the government to reform the surcharge rules, but ministers in Canberra will be paying close attention.", "description": "The inquiry into buy now, pay later operators risks being viewed as clashing with the Morrison government\u2019s efforts to promote fintechs and reduce living costs for consumers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5519%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_97/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4c3436e805c419071d37a483dc88a306a41770d3", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
