I grabbed him around the tie and said \"You do not want to fight me!\". '\n\nAt the Manchester hearing Dr Steeds said he has since tried three times to apologise to Mr A for his actions and had since attended an anger management course.\n\nWhen asked whether he was shocked about his behaviour replied: 'I am ashamed of what I did - and I was surprised by his own actions.'\n\nHe explained the pressures he was under personally at the time of the event which included a 'consistently increasing workload, a close and supportive colleague leaving the Heath Trust and a substantial number of other commitments which he said meant that his work-life balance had become overwhelmed.'\n\nDr Steeds said he had responsibilities beyond his normal role which included engaging with the government on behalf of one of the organisations with which he was involved on issues of understaffing and the subsequent effects on patients.\n\nHe told the Tribunal that he had since withdrawn from his position with the British Society of Echocardiography as well as other positions within other organisations.\n\nDr Steeds said he had since ought the support of a life coach, who will be providing executive coaching with him for the next year and said he was working towards establishing a 'roadmap in changing his responses to work pressures and those at home.' he said he had modified his work and now finishes at 6pm each evening.\n\nIn a statement fellow Consultant Cardiologist Dr Howard Marshall said: 'It was a great sadness to me to find that Dr Steeds is involved in a Maintaining High Professional Standards Investigation following an altercation with a driver.\n\n'As his Clinical Service Lead I have been supporting him through this process and it has been very evident to me that Rick has been severely affected by this incident.\n\n'However he has also recognised the stresses and strains that led up to this incident and also the effect on the other party involved.\n\nIn the car park of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, pictured, Steeds had a row with a driver which culminated in him grabbing him by the scruff of the neck. The driver went to the police, who advised no further action would be taken, and then the driver insisted on undertaking a Victim Right to Review after which Steeds accepted a caution\n\n'He has offered to write or meet the other party involved to apologise and has also undertaken an anger management course to help him understand how to reduce his stresses and to take every opportunity to ensure that such an incident never happens again.\n\n'To this end he has given up roles on national boards, he has dropped his application for a university chair at the University of Birmingham and he has reflected on this incident with great soul searching both with me and other senior mentors within the Trust. He has also taken advice from Occupational Health on how to manage his workload.'\n\nFurther hearings will be held to decide whether Steeds will be sanctioned. Panel chairman Mr Stuart McLeese said: 'The Tribunal had regard to Dr Steeds' behaviour and actions since the assault on Mr A.\n\n'It noted he immediately took responsibility for his actions and contacted the police, of his own volition, on a number of occasions.\n\n'He wrote to his solicitors within three days detailing his recollection of events. He also attempted to apologise to Mr A on a number of occasions and when considering the likelihood of Dr Steeds repeating his behaviour, the Tribunal was of the view that his oral evidence was comprehensive and compelling.\n\n'This was a single incident and the tribunal had regard to professional and personal pressures outlined by Dr Steeds which were an increasing workload and working environment, a very supportive colleague of his leaving the Trust, his unsuccessful application for research funding and various pressures on him at home, including family ill-health.\n\n'The Tribunal concluded that Dr Steeds was not personally impaired and that he has comprehensively reflected upon his behaviour and remediated as best he can following his assault on Mr A. The Tribunal concluded that there is very little chance of such behaviour being repeated in the future.\n\n'However, the Tribunal then went on to consider public interest and not his behaviour did cause alarm to those who witnessed it. Considering the wider public interest, the Tribunal were satisfied that any member of the public witnessing the incident would be concerned about such behaviour displayed by anybody, but particularly such behaviour by a member of the medical profession.'\n\nThe hearing continues.", "description": "Consultant cardiologist Richard Steeds, 56, had a row with a driver in a car park.
