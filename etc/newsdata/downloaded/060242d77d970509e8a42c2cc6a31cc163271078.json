We know that LGBTQ youth are much more likely to experience homelessness, which is one of the reasons why we need to invest more in youth homelessness in general and do the opposite of what this president is doing, which is allowing rules to go forward that would actually make it harder for transgender youth to access homeless services.\n\n\u201cThat is just wrong, and it will end in my administration,\u201d Buttigieg said.\n\nIn fact, while the HUD rule \u2014 posted in spring 2019 \u2014 does allow for shelters to make decisions based on privacy and safety, it specifically states that discrimination based on \u201csexual orientation and gender identity\u201d will not take place:\n\nThis proposed rule provides that grant recipients, subrecipients, owners, operators, managers, and providers (Shelter Providers) under HUD programs which permit single-sex or sex-segregated facilities (such as bathrooms or temporary, emergency shelters and other buildings and facilities with physical limitations or configurations that require and are permitted to have shared sleeping quarters or bathing facilities) may establish a policy, consistent with state and local law, by which such Shelter Provider considers an individual\u2019s sex for the purposes of determining accommodation within such shelters and for purposes of determining sex for admission to any facility or portion thereof. The proposed rule permits Shelter Providers to consider a range of factors in making such determinations, including privacy, safety, practical concerns, religious beliefs, any relevant considerations under civil rights and nondiscrimination authorities , the individual\u2019s sex as reflected in official government documents, as well as the gender which a person identifies with. The proposed rule does not dictate a required basis for making determinations other than that they be consistent with an overall policy. The proposed rule continues HUD\u2019s policy of ensuring that its programs are open to all eligible individuals and families regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nButtigieg joined eight other Democrat candidates at the marathon town hall, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Kamala Harris (D-CA), Cory Booker (D-NJ), and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), as well as former HUD Secretary Julian Castro (D), former Vice President Joe Biden (D), former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-TX), and Tom Steyer (D).\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter.", "description": "Democrat Pete Buttigieg falsely claimed during a town hall on Thursday that Trump is making it harder for homeless transgender youth to find shelter.", "authors": ["Penny Starr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Pete-Buttigieg-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
