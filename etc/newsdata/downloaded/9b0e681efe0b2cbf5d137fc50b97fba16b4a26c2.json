A safe place that doesn\u2019t just soothe you but makes you feel alive. For many, Prateek Kuhad\u2019s music is that safe place.\n\nYouTube\n\nI first heard Prateek Kuhad when I was sipping red-velvet hot chocolate at a cafe with a close friend. As soon as I heard the song, I wanted to know who the singer was. I learnt that the song that had managed to transport me to another place was \u2018100 words\u2019 by Prateek Kuhad.\n\nTwitter\n\nNot only did the song perfectly add to the mood in the cafe covered in fairy lights, it made me curious as a music lover.\n\nDon't Miss 43.8 K SHARES 23.6 K SHARES 16.8 K SHARES 4.6 K SHARES 8.1 K SHARES\n\nTwitter\n\nWithin a week of this cafe outing, I was sold. Prateek Kuhad\u2019s music was a discovery that could easily go own in my archive of memories of best discoveries. Soon, I was 'shuffling' between 'Raat Raazi\u2019 and \u2018Tune Kaha\u2019.\n\nSoon, I realised that his music also came in the starter pack of every house-party.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeing an independent artist came with a lot of challenges for Kuhad. Rolling Stone India hailed Kuhad as \u201cone of the country\u2019s leading singer-songwriters.\u201d His magic managed to transcend boundaries: he found frequent top-spots in radio lists, soon garnering a slew of accolades and honours around the globe.\n\nThanks to his mesmerising, cinematic songwriting and the way he manages to say the most apt things through his music, he left Millennials with a lot of feels. In March 2019, he spoke about his first starting out. He spoke about the struggles of an independent song maker.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe first couple of years...it was not like I was making a lot of money. It was just that my first record which was in 2013...before that in 2011, I was doing stuff. I was still in college. I was doing it for fun, more for myself.\n\nTwitter\n\n\"It was in 2013 when my first serious release 'Raat Raazi' happened. I got some attention and festival slots, started seeing some fans who would show up at every show. It was like a step up. I continued to do it,\u201d he explained.\n\nHowever, music being heard isn\u2019t equivalent to recognition. For Prateek, his music was being enjoyed by many but people still didn\u2019t know him well.\n\n\"I still don't feel famous. I don't think a lot of people know me. My music is pretty well known. But it's not like I am sitting on my album covers, all my music videos or putting up my photos all the time,\u201d he said.\n\nA lot of people started touting his music as the antidote to a bad break up or a heartbreak. But with his variety of songs like \u2018Kho Gaye Hum Kahan\u2019 and \u2018Jab Tu paas Aati Ho,\u2019 he tried to break that image. Thanks to his latest hit Cold/Mess fans have now started liking and appreciating his way of story-telling as well.\n\nPhoto by Namroud Gorguis on Unsplash\n\nIn the video, a couple revisits their happy relationship after a breakup and his song perfectly fits in the withdrawals that couples go through after breaking up.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrateek Kuhad\u2019s music is as real as heartbreak and wait, there\u2019s much more to it. In an age of remixes that make us cringe and question if there is any originality and real talent left, Kuhad\u2019s music is the beam of hope that lights up hope for many.", "description": "Amidst the chaos of daily life and the stress that comes with adulting, we all need a safe place.
