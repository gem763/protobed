Kamala Harris joined the call for President Donald Trump's impeachment on Monday in a prime-time town hall meeting. Time\n\nDemocratic presidential candidates, Billy Porter and an unexpected kiss were all part of the cold open on \"Saturday Night Live\" this weekend.\n\nThis week's CNN LGBTQ town hall was prime fodder for lots of laughs and cameo appearances during Saturday night's episode.\n\nAlex Moffat's Anderson Cooper said they were \"going to go out \u2013 all out,\" bringing out \"Pose\" star Billy Porter to the stage, in the first of many guest appearances during the opening sketch.\n\nPorter served up hilarious introductions for all the candidates, starting with Chris Redd's Sen. Cory Booker: \"He may live in the projects, but ladies he ain't no project!\"\n\nWhen an audience member asked whether the politician has always been supportive of the gay community, bringing up a 1992 op-ed where \"(Booker) said some very derogatory things about the gay community,\" Redd's Booker said, \"I don't want you to think I'm dodging the question, so I'm going to go now.\"\n\nColin Jost's Pete Buttigieg, who Porter announced was \"representing House of Buttigieg,\" had a pointed answer when someone asked: \"How do you respond to those who say you're not gay in the right way?\n\n\"I've heard that, but there's no wrong way to be gay, unless you're Ellen this week,\" Jost's Buttigieg ribbed, taking aim at Ellen DeGeneres and her comments about being friends with George W. Bush.\n\nEllen DeGeneres, George W. Bush: Gwen Stefani, Mark Ruffalo and more split on friendship\n\nPorter issued a \"Warrening, Warrening!\" before welcoming Sen. Elizabeth Warren to the stage.\n\n\"Y'all known I'm not a lesbian, but all the ingredients are there,\" Kate McKinnon's Warren joked.\n\nMcKinnon's Warren then launched into a spot-on reenactment of the real Warren's interaction during the town hall about gay marriage, before flipping the script and delivering her best burns.\n\n\"So, senator, let's say you've been on the campaign trail. How would you respond if someone said to you 'I'm old fashioned, and my faith teaches me that marriage is between one man and one woman'?\" the audience member asked.\n\n\"I would say, sir, tell me your bus stop, 'cause I want to know where you get off,\" McKinnon's Warren said. \"If someone doesn't wanna serve gay people at their small business, I bet that's not the only thing that's small. And when people say gay and trans people shouldn't be included in Civil Rights Act protections, well I wish their parents had used protection.\"\n\n'SNL': David Harbour finds Pete Davidson in the Upside Down in 'Stranger Things' monologue\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda stopped by from \"the house of urban deliciousness\" as former Obama HUD Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, who was asked what he will you do to bring queer voices into his cabinet.\n\n\"Well first of all, gracias,\" Miranda's Castro said. \"As a Democrat, I want to apologize for not being gay, but I promise to do better in the future. However, I am Latino, which we can all agree is something. Look, I'm young, I'm diverse. I'm LatinObama, let's get the hashtag going!\"\n\nHe continued: \"There was once another man who left his mark on this nation's history\" getting interrupted just as a song from his musical \"Hamilton\" started to play. \"I was going to say Al Gore!\"\n\nThe final candidate to grace the stage was \"the Delaware daddy whose only vice is the choo choo train,\" aka Woody Harrelson's Joe Biden.\n\n\"SNL\" targeted Biden's gaffes on the campaign trail and allegations of inappropriate behavior.\n\nHarrelson's Biden seemingly flirted with an audience member (\"Oh look at you, if I told you you had a beautiful body would you hold it against me?\"), who asked about his past support of the military's \"don't ask don't tell\" policy.\n\nAfter a long pause in remembering the year of his story (1926) to answer the question, Harrelson's Biden recounted: \"I was in downtown Dover with my father, and we see two well-dressed men, very well-dressed men \u2014 you know what I mean by well-dressed, right? Who's nervous about this story, show of hands? \u2026 These men turned the corner and kissed, and I turned to my daddy and I say 'what the huh,' and he said 'baby they were born this way.' And that was Delaware 19-clickicity clack.\"\n\nHarrelson's Biden ended the sketch by asking Moffat's Cooper if he had \"ever been kissed by a vice president before?\" before planting a kiss on his lips.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/13/snl-lgbtq-town-hall-ellen-degeneres-billy-porter-lin-manuel-miranda/3967514002/", "description": "CNN's\u00a0LGBTQ town hall was prime fodder for laughs and cameo appearances from Billy Porter, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Woody Harrelson on \"SNL.\"", "authors": ["Anika Reed", "Published A.M.
