We wanted something novel,\" added the 21-year-old, who estimates his cafe draws 70 to 80 customers a day, nearly doubling since he posted social media pictures of his dyed dogs.\n\nBut until now customers have been more interested in taking pictures with Lu's dogs than signing up for the dye service.\n\nLu said the imported dye he used did not harm the dogs, and was spread only on the upper part of their fur, rather than extending down to the base.\n\nTo round out the vacation experience, the Candy Planet Pet Cafe also offers washing and hotel services.\n\nThe attention drawn by the chow-chows has not all been positive, however, with animal rights group PETA urging people to keep away.\n\n\"Coating dogs with chemical dyes is stressful and can even cause allergic reactions on their skin, nose, and eyes,\" Jason Baker, its Asia vice president, told Reuters.\n\n\"PETA urges travelers to stay away from any business that exploits animals for a money-grabbing gimmick,\" he said in a statement.\n\nSome online commentators have accused Lu of animal abuse.\n\n\"In a dog's world, there is only you,\" a user with the handle Biewenwochouliumang wrote on China's Twitter-like Weibo. \"Please be kind to them.\"\n\n(Reporting by Fang Nanlin; Writing by Martin Pollard; Editing by Karishma Singh and Clarence Fernandez)", "description": "CHENGDU, China (Reuters) - Would you like your dog transformed into a panda?", "authors": ["Fang Nanlin"], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
