(Matt Dunham/AP)\n\nJeremy Hammond, a hacker who admitted stealing files from an intelligence firm, has been brought to Virginia to testify before a grand jury that he believes is the panel investigating WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, Hammond\u2019s representatives said in a statement.\n\nThe move is a new indication that prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia are expanding the WikiLeaks investigation even as Assange fights extradition from England.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s effort to try to compel Jeremy to testify is punitive and mean-spirited,\u201d the Jeremy Hammond Support Committee said in a statement. \u201cJeremy firmly believes that grand juries are repressive tools of the government, used to investigate and intimidate activist communities and are abused by prosecutors to gain access to intelligence to which they are not entitled.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the Eastern District of Virginia declined to comment Tuesday.\n\nHammond was moved over the weekend from federal prison in Memphis, the committee said. He was set to be released later this year but could serve more time because of the move, which imperils Hammond\u2019s participation in a drug-treatment program.\n\nWorking with an anonymous-affiliated group called LulzSec, Hammond, a well-known Chicago hacker and anarchist activist, stole millions of internal emails from the intelligence firm Stratfor and released them to WikiLeaks, which published them in February 2012. The hack also exposed tens of thousands of credit card numbers of Stratfor clients, which include governments and major corporations that pay for analysis of international threats and trends.\n\nHe pleaded guilty to violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in 2013 and was sentenced to 10 years in prison, with immunity from prosecution in other districts.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what authorities hope to learn from Hammond or how they would use the information. Assange is fighting extradition from jail in the United Kingdom; he has been charged with violating the Espionage Act and conspiracy to hack into a government computer. All the charges against him are related to WikiLeaks\u2019 2010 publication of war logs and diplomatic cables leaked by Army private Chelsea Manning.\n\nA formal extradition request was issued in June, and grand juries cannot be used to bolster existing charges.\n\nNick Vamos, former head of extradition at the Crown Prosecution Service in England, said the treaty between the two countries still allows for the U.S. to add charges to the Assange case, but that will become more difficult and problematic for the American prosecutors as they get closer to the scheduled extradition hearing in February.\n\n\u201cUp until the point the district judge makes his or her decision, the U.S. can amend its request,\u201d said Vamos. He cautioned that if the changes came after those preliminary hearings were held, \u201cit would be considered by the defense and the judges extremely annoying, because you have to go back to the start. It\u2019s very bad practice to do that.\u201d\n\nProsecutors could question Hammond in connection with the December 2011 hack of Stratfor and any interactions he had directly with Assange.\n\n\u201cCharges against Assange for the Stratfor hack could even be charged as a separate case,\u201d former U.S. attorney Barbara McQuade said. \u201cAnother possibility is charges against a co-defendant.\u201d\n\nAn Icelandic hacker who worked with Assange at that time, Sigurdur Thordarson, has said he was interviewed by prosecutors after the May indictment. Thordarson in 2011 established a relationship with Hector Monsegur or \u201cSabu,\u201d co-founder of LulzSec, who unbeknown to Thordarson was an FBI informant. An associate of Assange had reached out to Sabu online and sought to enlist LulzSec in hacking Icelandic government computers, according to former U.S. officials.\n\nManning is in jail in Alexandria, Va., for refusing to testify before a grand jury; prosecutors claim her testimony is \u201crelevant and essential to an ongoing investigation into charges or targets\u201d beyond Assange.\n\nAt his own sentencing in 2013, Hammond said he was inspired in large part by \u201cthe heroic actions of Chelsea Manning, who had exposed the atrocities committed by U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nHe apologized for releasing \u201cthe personal information of innocent people who have had nothing to do with the operations of the institutions that I had targeted.\u201d But he argued he was justified in targeting \u201cinformation security firms because they work in secret to protect government and corporate interests at the expense of individual rights.\u201d\n\nHe emphasized that it was another hacker who first broke into the credit card database. According to court documents, that hacker reached out to Sabu, who alerted Hammond to the vulnerability.\n\nAlong with Stratfor, Hammond admitted hacking the computer systems of several law enforcement organizations and defense companies. He also hacked into the websites of several foreign governments \u2014 under the direction, he said, of Monsegur.\n\nDevlin Barrett contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Jeremy Hammond is serving a 10-year prison sentence for hacking.", "authors": ["Rachel Weiner", "Local Reporter Covering Federal Court In Alexandria", "Va.", "Local Court In Arlington", "Ellen Nakashima", "National Security Reporter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Yo6dYfsA_OPZAYj88ZouTBO2F7k=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IEDD3CD6JAI6TC5XB7DZNTZOYA.jpg"}
