So the ball strikes the post over here \u2026 now as it strikes the post I believe that the ball spins,' he said as he moved the ball towards the goal line.\n\n'So it comes down, I believe it spins in here and by the time it gets over here it's come around and its bent and it looks like this.'\n\n'That is the sort of angle you saw when you saw the replay is you saw the grass there, you're thinking it's over the line but as I come closer and you look above, it is nowhere near the whole ball is over the line as I look down at it there.'\n\nThe post-match segment, which was shared to Twitter, caused a massive backlash from Wanderers fans, with many accusing him of showing bias.\n\nWhen Fox Sports commentator Robbie Slater (pictured) tried to break down the VAR call angry fans accused him of being biased\n\n'Imagine honestly doing this instead of celebrating the great game. How much bias does Fox Sports need to keep showing SFC?' one fan wrote.\n\n'I wish we could get unbiased analysis and commentary on the A-League, there's more teams than Sydney and Melbourne,' another added.\n\n'Only surprise is he isn't wearing smurf blue. Embarrassing for a sports broadcaster to be so openly biased . Wouldn't have done this if the decision was against any other team,' another fan replied.\n\nOther fans poked fun at Slater for the segment, with one writing sarcastically: 'Extremely scientific and intellectual, thank you Robbie.'\n\nIt was the first time the Wanderers had beaten Sydney FC in their last seven clashes over three years.", "description": "Socceroos legend Robbie Slater has been mocked over a bizarre TV segment where he tried to explain a controversial call from the A-League Sydney derby.", "authors": ["Adam Mccleery For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/01/20231172-0-image-a-27_1572138442045.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
