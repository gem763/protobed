Geiger announced the project at Devcon 5, Ethereum\u2019s annual conference which was held in Osaka, Japan this week.\n\nThe developers released a virtual machine that runs a permissionless version of Libra, called Movement, built on the Tendermint blockchain protocol.\n\nAccording to the firm\u2019s website, OpenLibra is \u201cAn alternative to Facebook's Libra, that places emphasis on open governance and economic decentralization.\u201d Those behind the OpenLibra project think that Facebook\u2019s project will ultimately be successful, so the point is to create a fork that is compatible with Libra Coin, \u201creplacing what's concerning in a non-adversarial way.\u201d\n\nAmongst the issues the founders of the OpenLibra project have with Facebook\u2019s network is that it is \u201cdistributed, but not decentralized,\u201d that it is not permissionless, that it is without privacy guarantees, and this it is run by a \u201cplutocracy\u201d\u2014a network of 27 ultra-rich companies including Mastercard, Visa, and Uber.\n\nBy comparison, the OpenLibra project is run by \u201ca loose collective of individuals.\u201d including several employees from Wireline and Cosmos. It has no \"association members\", \"partners\", neither \"employees\" nor \"leaders\" it reads.\n\nOpenLibra is also concerned that because Libra controls the ratio of coins in the basket, it will become \u201cthe internet\u2019s central bank,\u201d undermining the authority of sovereign central to determine monetary policy. It also enables surveillance finance, defined as \u201cOne's ability to engage financially (e.g. borrow in Libra) will potentially be determined by their social graph and online activity.\u201d\n\nOpenLibra is an attempt to push back against some of those concerns. According to French billionaire and Libra investor Xavier Niel Friday, Libra is \u201cinevitable\u201d. But with launch partners dropping out, Mark Zuckerberg testifying before the US Congress and ministers vowing regulation of Facebook\u2019s cryptocurrency project, it has some tough hurdles to overcome before it launches. If regulators manage to neuter Libra completely, OpenLibra might never be necessary.\n\n\n\n", "description": "OpenLibra fixes some of Libra\u2019s problems\u2014but with Facebook's cryptocurrency facing pushback from regulators, will it be necessary?", "authors": ["Robert Stevens"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/NPRJ3dM4QL2g9h4e34.SiQ--~B/aD00NzA7dz05MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/decrypt_251/171c3db5f506c4aee1ec180d9f0cfb02", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
