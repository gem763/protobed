She then goes 16 hours without eating anything, and she says it makes a huge difference to her overall health and wellbeing.\n\nBut 16-hours without any food at all sounds pretty challenging, so how do you cope if you\u2019re prone to getting hangry between every meal?\n\nThe former Friends star also loves a good sweat session. She reportedly works out five times a week (imagine having that kind of time), and she does all of that while fasting. We need to know how.\n\nIntermittent fasting can be challenging enough, but when you also throw punishing workouts into the mix, it can be hard to know how to maintain your energy levels and recover safely using your diet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo we asked a performance nutritionist exactly how to maintain a healthy, safe, effective fitness regime when following intermittent fasting.\n\n\u2018Intermittent fasting (IF) has become a very hot topic in recent times as more and more people advocate its use,\u2019 explains performance nutritionist Dean Coulson.\n\nWhat is intermittent fasting? Intermittent fasting is an eating plan, not a diet. All it means is going without food for a period of time. We all fast while we\u2019re asleep \u2013 this regime usually just extends the period of time where we not eating anything. The amount of time you choose to fast for is up to you \u2013 Jenifer Aniston chooses 16 hours, but you could go shorter. Some people do it every day, and others choose one or two days in the week to fast. It\u2019s supposed to be an easy and effective way of getting lean without having to go on a diet, with some studies even saying it can increase life expectancy and slow ageing \u2013 but the benefits aren\u2019t conclusively supported.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t believe that one way of eating serves all, but since I use IF myself and with clients, I\u2019ll let you decide for yourself if it\u2019s something that would fit with your lifestyle and help you reach your goals.\u2019\n\nDean says there are a number of different approaches to applying IF. Some involve 24-hour fasts a few times per week, while others suggest fasting using the 16:8 protocol where you fast for 16 hours per day (essentially skipping breakfast).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The 16:8 approach works well especially when you work out regularly and have fat-loss or gaining muscle goals,\u2019 says Dean.\n\n\u2018Intermittent fasting still allows you to maintain a moderate to intense workout load while still maintaining your energy and metabolism.\n\n\u2018Many people think that IF drains both of these aspects, but the opposite has proven to be the case. You often have more energy and a higher metabolism while engaged in this type of fasting, making it the best of both worlds.\u2019\n\nCan you still workout while intermittently fasting?\n\nDean says intermittent fasting is good practice to include in your workout plan.\n\n\u2018It has beneficial aspects to it: You will have more energy and increased strength and endurance as the body isn\u2019t dealing with digestive stress at the same time.\n\n\u2018We have more than enough stored energy to see us through until eating begins at the end of the fasting period\u2019 (Picture: Ella Byworth/ Metro.co.uk)\n\n\u2018But there are also benefits that are a little less easy to see, like a cleansing of your system that takes place with any fast, as your body adjusts to less content being put into it.\u2019\n\nBenefits aside, is it actually safe to workout while following IF? Dean thinks it usually is, but individual circumstances need to be taken into consideration.\n\n\u2018Essentially 16:8 intermittent fasting is like skipping breakfast and starting to eat at lunch time,\u2019 says Dean.\n\n\u2018Of course, there may be instances that it does not suit some people suffering from health conditions, or suffering from eating disorders or a bad relationship with food and so these would need to be addressed before embarking on something like IF.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018However, for people who are looking to optimise their health, I invite you to consider we have more than enough stored energy to see us through until eating begins at the end of the fasting period.\n\n\u2018There is ample evidence to support intermittent fasting as a good lifestyle choice as long as the principles set out below are followed.\u2019\n\nHow can you refuel properly while following intermittent fasting?\n\nRecovery is done when you sleep, but refuelling your body after a workout is also really important.\n\n\u2018The best way to fuel your workouts is to eat your starchy carbs \u2013 such as sweet potatoes or Jasmine rice \u2013 as the last meal of the day,\u2019 suggests Dean.\n\n\u2018Focus on nutrient dense foods\u2019 (Picture: Ella Byworth/ Metro.co.uk)\n\n\u2018That way, you are fully fuelled for the next day\u2019s workout. It also has the added benefit of making eating with family or friends much easier and convenient in the evening.\n\n\u2018Focus on nutrient dense foods. Having an eight-hour window to eat allows you to have two-four meals in that period, depending on your goals.\n\nNutritional tips for intermittent fasting If you can\u2019t kill it, pick it or grow it you should avoid it.\n\nEat real, whole foods as much as possible.\n\nSeafood must be wild caught, never farm-raised.\n\nChicken and eggs should be organic and free roaming.\n\nAvoid processed foods, fake foods, food additives and agricultural chemicals.\n\nDrink 1 litre of water per 50lb of body weight.\n\nLimit fruit consumption to 1-2 servings per day.\n\nLimit alcohol consumption to once per week.\n\nLimit consumption of common inflammatory foods i.e dairy (except for eggs), wheat, white flour, fried foods, trans fats, soy and sugar.\n\nRotate foods. Don\u2019t eat the exact same thing on a daily basis.\n\nEat as many green vegetables as possible.\n\nBreak your fast with a greens drink to boost your nutrients and 1 cup of warm water with the juice of an entire small lemon squeezed into it.\n\nGet most of your fat intake from animal protein \u2013 grass fed beef, salmon, egg yolks, etc. Dean Coulson, performance nutritionist\n\n\u2018IF allows the body to rest, turn to the body to burn fat as its primary fuel source instead of sugar, helps balance hormones, and gives you more energy for your training without compromising strength,\u2019 says Dean.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018If you are on the fence give it a go.\u2019\n\nDon\u2019t forget, taking on any new kind of diet or eating plan isn\u2019t a good idea if you have a history of disordered eating. If you have any concerns about your relationship with food you should speak to your GP straight away.\n\nBut if you do decide to start intermittent fasting, it\u2019s important that you eat really well.\n\nMake sure you\u2019re hitting all of your food groups, not denying yourself anything and hydrating and sleeping well too.\n\nHealth is holistic and it\u2019s a combination of diet, exercise and self-care that will really improve your overall wellbeing.\n\nMORE: The workouts you should be doing at each stage of your menstrual cycle\n\nMORE: A mum suffering from endometriosis will be forced into menopause at age of 30\n\nMORE: How to stop \u2018cancel anxiety\u2019 \u2013 the guilt that comes with blowing off your plans\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "As Jenifer Aniston reveals that she follow intermittent fasting, we take a look at hoe to safely workout while following this eating plan.", "authors": ["Natalie Morris"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/sei_739549_1571754255.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
