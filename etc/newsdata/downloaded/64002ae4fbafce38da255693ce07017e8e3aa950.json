According to Lauren Wolfe, attorney for Travelers United, a consumer nonprofit organization backing the initiative, resort fees are \"the most-hated fee in travel.\"\n\nThe amount of money hotels earn from such resort fees, which can also be called destination fees, facility fees, or cleaning fees, is staggering, according to Congresswoman Johnson.\n\n\u201cThis summer, we witnessed a record number of Americans take the opportunity to travel. Unfortunately, this also meant a record number of travelers were subjected to deceptive hidden fees charged by hotels, motels, and other places of accommodation,\u201d said Congresswoman Johnson.\n\n\u201cIt is projected that in 2019, over three billion dollars in revenue alone will be collected from consumers due to these hidden fees. Consumers should be able to enjoy their vacation without being ripped off and financially burdened. This bill would require that the prices advertised by hotels and online travel agencies must include all mandatory fees that will be charged to a consumer, excluding taxes.\"\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nJohnson and Fortenberry are not the first to attempt to tackle this issue. The FTC attempted to remedy the issue back in 2012 with letters warning 35 hotels and 11 online travel agents that their resort fees could confuse consumers, however nothing has happened since then, and the deceptive practice of unadvertised resort fees has continued ever since.\n\nAn FTC study from Jan. 2017 uncovered that \u201chotel rooms and other places of lodging are often advertised at a rate and later in the buying process mandatory fees (aka resort fees, cleaning fees, or facility fees) are disclosed that were not included in the advertised room rate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe number of short-term lodging facilities that charged mandatory resort fees is growing\u201d while using \u201cadvertising that does not reflect the true mandatory cost of a stay at a place of short-term lodging is deceptive,\u201d the study continued.\n\nSince then, 47 state attorney generals have opened an investigation in hotel resort fees, and specifically singled out Marriott for its deceptive use of them. Meanwhile, Wyndham and Hilton Worldwide were hit with individual lawsuits for advertising low room rental rates while obscuring the additional resort fees.\n\nWhile much has been made over the use of resort fees, Marriott Chief Financial Officer Leeny Oberg downplayed the significance of the controversy.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s not perhaps as big as some may think,\u201d Oberg told travel industry website Skift.\n\n\u201cResort fees tend to be a hot topic because I think you\u2019ve probably seen there\u2019s been some chatter out there from the (state) attorneys general about the way they are displayed. And I\u2019ll remind everybody that we always make sure they are very clearly displayed before you actually book a room.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nA hearing for the Hotel Advertising Transparency Act likely won\u2019t take place until 2020, as the initiative makes its way through a subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.", "description": "Two members of Congress introduced a piece of legislation that would eliminate hotels from using deceptive resort fees.", "authors": ["Matthew Mcnulty"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/07/0/0/Hilton.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
