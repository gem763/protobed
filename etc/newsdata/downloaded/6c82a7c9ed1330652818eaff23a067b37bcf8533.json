REUTERS/Aly Song\n\nChinese sponsors and partners have been cutting ties with the NBA after a tweet by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey last week supporting anti-government protests in the Chinese-ruled city.\n\nThe Shanghai Sports Federation said the cancellation of the fan event ahead of Thursday\u2019s game between the Brooklyn Nets and Los Angeles Lakers was due to the \u201cinappropriate attitude\u201d of Morey and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver.\n\nA Wednesday afternoon press conference with both teams was indefinitely delayed, organisers said. Outside the team hotel, workers tore down massive banners advertising the game, according to a Reuters witness.\n\nSilver said on Tuesday the league supported Morey\u2019s right to exercise his freedom of expression, further angering authorities and some fans in China and threatening the NBA\u2019s business there, said to be worth more than $4 billion. [nL2N26S0S8]\n\nMorey deleted the tweet and apologised on Monday, but Chinese broadcasters, sportswear companies and sponsors have said they are reviewing their ties with the NBA, which has had a presence in China since 1992.\n\nThe NBA initially described the anger over Morey\u2019s post as \u201cregrettable,\u201d drawing criticism from U.S. politicians, who accused the league of putting its China business ahead of free speech.\n\nSilver, speaking on Tuesday in Japan before a preseason game between the Rockets and Toronto Raptors, said it was not up to the league to regulate what players, employees and team owners said. [nL3N26T18Z] [nL5N26T4RL]\n\nOn Wednesday, an editorial in the official English-language China Daily accused Silver of \u201cbrazenly endorsing Morey\u2019s secessionist-supporting tweet\u201d and giving \u201ca shot to the arms of the rioters of Hong Kong.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Silver thinks endorsing the indiscriminate violence the radical Hong Kong protesters are resorting to ... is supporting freedom of expression, then he should think again,\u201d it said.\n\nThe protests were \u201ca bid to liberate the city\u201d and \u201ca secessionist pipe-dream\u201d peddled by demonstrators \u201cto justify their summer hooliganism,\u201d the newspaper added.\n\nThe protests were sparked by opposition to a bill allowing extradition to mainland China, but have since evolved into broader calls for democracy. None of the protesters\u2019 five demands is secession or independence.\n\nSome fans expressed dismay at the way the controversy had spread, while voicing their support for Beijing\u2019s view.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m patriotic of course. I support that Hong Kong is part of China, but I just don\u2019t understand this,\u201d said Yu Jie, a fan waiting to see the players in Shanghai.\n\nThe basketball furore also comes against the backdrop of the U.S.-China trade war, which escalated after Washington imposed visa restrictions on Chinese officials on Tuesday. [nL2N26T0K3]\n\nThe Global Times, a Chinese tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party\u2019s People\u2019s Daily newspaper, accused Silver of caving in to political pressure, saying the NBA was treating the Chinese market with arrogant disregard.\n\n\u201cTweeting something offensive to the Chinese people before a series of NBA promotional activities in China only shows a lack of intellect, respect, and responsibility,\u201d it said.\n\nIn a separate report, the newspaper also said that some Chinese internet users had made \u201cdisrespectful comments\u201d about the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201c(It) should remind Western media that for Chinese people, the Hong Kong riots are just like the 9/11, which is horrible and can\u2019t be justified,\u201d the Global Times said.\n\nNo one has been killed in several months of protests in Hong Kong, although scores - mostly protesters and journalists - have been hurt. The Sept. 11, 2001, attacks killed 2,996 people and led to the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan.\n\nFALLOUT\n\nBasketball is the most popular sport in China, with about 500 million people consuming NBA content. The league has deals with TV and digital media outlets across the country, and teams have played exhibition games annually since 2014.\n\nNBA China, launched in 2008 to run the league\u2019s business, is now worth more than $4 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nThe NBA had planned media events in Shanghai this week ahead of the Nets-Lakers game, but Chinese organisers cancelled an event at a Shanghai school on Tuesday and an open training session with the Nets on Wednesday.\n\nChinese celebrities had already said they would boycott the \u201cfans\u2019 night\u201d before it was cancelled.\n\nState television dropped plans to air the NBA exhibition games in China this week, saying a country\u2019s sovereignty and social stability were \u201cnot within the scope of freedom of speech.\u201d China has accused the West of stirring up anti-Beijing sentiment in Hong Kong. [nL3N26T24W]\n\nSome Chinese fans have asked for streaming subscription refunds from exclusive service provider Tencent, which halted broadcast of Rockets games after the Morey tweet.\n\nTencent isn\u2019t the only company distancing itself from business dealings with the NBA.\n\nOnline travel agency Ctrip said on Tuesday it had stopped selling tickets to NBA games and NBA-related tour packages. Smartphone maker Vivo and sportswear maker ANTA Sports Products Ltd (2020.HK) have also stopped working with the NBA.\n\nBut the escalating row did not seem to bother some waiting outside Shanghai\u2019s Ritz Carlton hotel to catch a glimpse of the NBA players.\n\n\u201cPersonal opinions belong to them. It doesn\u2019t affect us chasing the stars,\u201d Xu Ziyang, a university student from Jiangsu, told Reuters.", "description": "Chinese organisers on Wednesday cancelled a fan event on the eve of an National Basketball Association (NBA) exhibition game in Shanghai, the latest fallout in a row over comments by a team official supporting protests in Hong Kong.", "authors": ["David Stanway", "Xihao Jiang", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438782970&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF980QJ-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
