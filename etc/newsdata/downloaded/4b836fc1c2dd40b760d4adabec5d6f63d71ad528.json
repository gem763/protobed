But this was not an isolated incident. In the past few days, Twitch has been cracking down on so-called \u201csexually suggestive\u201d content more aggressively than usual, and picking some questionable targets for its crusade.\n\nIn addition to Quqco, several other notable streamers have received suspensions or warnings from Twitch about sexually suggestive content in the past few days. Late last week, IRL streamer Bridgett Devoue was given a three-day suspension for \u201csharing or engaging in sexually suggestive content or activities,\u201d but Twitch did not elaborate any further.\n\nOver the weekend, Overwatch streamer Fareeha got hit with a warning (and a 90-day probationary period) after wearing a sports bra and baggy shorts at the gym. Also over the weekend, art streamer Saruei found herself on the wrong side of a warning for drawing \u201cnudes,\u201d despite the fact that her characters \u2014 while hentai-inspired and scantily clad \u2014 are clothed. Today, Twitch suspended her for three days.\n\nLastly and most strangely, the weekend also saw Twitch take aim at Spongebob: Battle For Bikini Bottom streamer Shift\u2019s emote of Spongebob ripping his pants, a reference to a classic episode of the long-running Nickelodeon series in which Spongebob gets a laugh by accidentally ripping his pants and then does it repeatedly until the joke loses its lustre. This, too, was \u201csexual,\u201d in Twitch\u2019s eyes, and the emote was disallowed.\n\nImage: Quqco\n\nNobody\u2019s entirely sure what to make of the latest spate of suspensions. This is in part because, as ever, Twitch has failed to lay out a consistent roadmap of what streamers should do to stay on the right side of the rules. For example, Fareeha\u2019s warning specifically accused her of wearing \u201cunderwear or lingerie,\u201d when she was, in reality, wearing baggy gym clothes in a setting where you\u2019d expect to see them.\n\nTwitch\u2019s guidelines around what streamers can and cannot wear are vague and contextual; the sort of attire Fareeha was wearing might not have cut it if a streamer was broadcasting from their bedroom, but streamers regularly wear gym clothes in the gym. Some men even go shirtless. It\u2019s not clear why Twitch singled out Fareeha.\n\nFareeha is as confused as anyone, and tired of the inconsistency. \u201cI\u2019m aware another streamer was just recently banned for a cosplay that showed a little bit of leg,\u201d Fareeha told Kotaku in an email, referring to Quqco. \u201cIt baffles me that she and I are the people getting reprimanded for \u2018not sticking to TOS\u2019 while others who have honestly done way worse go under the radar.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can they ban her for showing some thigh, and put me on probation for showing shoulders, when there are streamers who have shown way more private things?\u201d Fareeha said. \u201cAll the power to the girls who can showcase their bodies with confidence; the successful \u2018titty streamers\u2019 that have gotten so much flak in the wake of the recent ban/warning waves are genuinely not the issue. The big problem here is the inconsistency with which Twitch approaches these bans.\u201d\n\nWhile Fareeha does not have concrete evidence of this, she suspects foul play. She said that she\u2019s been harassed before by a YouTuber with a Discord dedicated to harassment of select streamers, and that there are other \u201ctroll Discords\u201d that often target women and members of the LGBT+ community.\n\nOne common tactic these groups share is mass usage of Twitch\u2019s reporting tool. Earlier this year, Fareeha received a hate speech suspension that she now chalks up to mass reporting after a controversial moment in which she said that South American Overwatch players \u201care shit.\u201d She apologised shortly afterward, but Twitch still suspended her for 30 days.\n\nFareeha disputed the suspension and got it shortened. In the meantime, people flooded her Discord with harassing messages.\n\n\u201cThe people responsible for it were saying disgusting, racist, sexist and homophobic things about me on all kinds of platforms, and when I needed Twitch for support and help, I was the one who got punished for it,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile Twitch\u2019s process for meting out warnings and suspensions is purposefully opaque, Fareeha suspects that Twitch acts on reports that reach a certain critical mass more quickly than others.\n\n\u201cI hope if anything, this recent wave of bans quiets those still saying women get special treatment on this platform, because sometimes it feels like the opposite.\u201d\n\n\u201cMass reports seem automatically actioned sometimes, and it really offers the streamer no protection when real people aren\u2019t the ones processing reports from potential trolls,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThat being said, if my case was looked at by an actual person, there\u2019s definitely something more to it. Whether it\u2019s personal bias, some kind of sexism or whatever other \u2018ism\u2019 it could be, it\u2019s clear that Twitch has let the [terms of service]-breaking actions of many others slide, while I get penalised for wearing long shorts and a sports bra so big it\u2019s practically a crop top.\u201d\n\nBridgett Devoue also thinks it\u2019s possible that she was mass reported, but doesn\u2019t believe that was necessarily the cause of her suspension. Her streams generally involve her sitting in a chair and talking to her chat while wearing a crop top, short shorts, and stockings.\n\nThis has earned her the ire of groups like the popular subreddit and drama haven Livestreamfail, a place where users have sometimes been known to brag about reporting streamers who they perceive as violating Twitch\u2019s terms of service. There, women are often derided as \u201ctitty streamers\u201d or \u201cTwitch thots.\u201d\n\nDevoue said she tends to avoid reading Livestreamfail because she has no desire to marinate in all the hate. Instead, she believes her suspension was the result of an \u201cover-correction\u201d on Twitch\u2019s part, rooted in \u201cbacklash\u201d stemming from other recent controversies.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an active user on Twitter, and I constantly see users frustrated at some streamers seemingly getting away with acts others would be banned for, and even comments of favoritism towards female streamers,\u201d she told Kotaku in a Twitter DM. \u201cI hope if anything, this recent wave of bans quiets those still saying women get special treatment on this platform, because sometimes it feels like the opposite.\u201d\n\nWhile Twitch has not specified which element of Devoue\u2019s stream it found to be so sexual that it caused the rulebook to explode, Devoue believes it might have been her chat, which she says recently expanded from hundreds of concurrents to thousands thanks to increased exposure and a sudden popularity growth spurt. This made moderating chat a precariously tall order for her then-smaller moderation staff, and some potentially objectionable comments slipped through the cracks.\n\n\u201cI simply wasn\u2019t prepared for situations that began arising due to increased chat participation,\u201d she said. \u201cTo be clear, I always ban racism, slurs, homophobia, sexism, or violence. The grey area for me was comments of a sexual nature, as I\u2019m an open person not afraid to talk about almost any topic, including sex.\n\nI believe we can always have mature dialogue about almost any topic, and maybe find the humour in otherwise serious things. I disdain censorship outside of violent hate speech, so it\u2019s been hard for me to find that balance while growing as a streamer.\u201d\n\nImage: Bridgett\n\nBut again, Twitch didn\u2019t actually tell her whether or not that\u2019s why she got suspended. She\u2019s since brought on more moderators and listened to advice from other streamers, but she remains in the dark, just like everybody else.\n\n\u201cI think what makes these bans difficult to define is Twitch caring about context more than anything,\u201d Devoue said. \u201cFor example, you can stream in a bikini, but only if it\u2019s for use by a pool, not just sitting in your apartment. Nudity in a video game is allowed, to an extent, but nudity elsewhere is not.\n\nAgain, I just think warnings and specificities after the bans would help all of us streamers know exactly what Twitch wants, and how we can safely be within their boundaries and make their lives easier by not breaking [terms of service]. To be fair, I\u2019m sure this is all a lot more complicated than simply explaining things more, and I commend Twitch\u2019s efforts in this matter.\u201d\n\nSaruei, who was suspended for drawing \u201cnude\u201d characters, declined to speak to Kotaku out of concern that she could face further repercussions from Twitch. However, prior to her recent suspension, she spoke out against what she feels is \u201chypocrisy\u201d on Twitch\u2019s part. Suggestive poses apparently aren\u2019t allowed in her drawings, she said, but it\u2019s fine when some people do them IRL.\n\n\u201cThese are suggestive poses, right?\u201d she said of her own art while discussing her Twitch warning during a recent (now-unavailable) stream. \u201cWe agree with that, right? Why I can\u2019t draw waifus like this when there is fucking Twitch girls that can do it?\u201d\n\nShe went on to express frustration about the lack of clarity that she, like others, has had to deal with. \u201cI hope it won\u2019t happen again, because I asked them \u2018What is the problem with these drawings?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIs it the clothing or the pose? What is against Twitch guidelines? I need to know.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it the clothing or the pose? What is against Twitch guidelines? I need to know.\u201d\n\nToday, she did receive some clarity \u2014 and also a suspension.\n\nIn an email she read on stream before the suspension went into effect, Twitch said that her characters\u2019 poses and the \u201cfocus on the butt in particular\u201d constituted a no-go zone. She was also told not to promote her stream with titles focusing on \u201clewd art.\u201d\n\nAs for Shift, he was baffled when Twitch first placed a \u201cRIP\u201d tombstone atop his Spongebob-with-ripped-pants emote. \u201cYou\u2019re joking, right?\u201d he said on Twitter at the time, posting an image of his \u201csexual content\u201d violation. \u201cHonestly Twitch, get fucking real. When I go around and see horny boobie emotes everywhere on this site, but I can\u2019t have the iconic Spongebob pants rip as an emote, that\u2019s how you know we\u2019ve got top-tier moderation and guidelines on this website.\u201d\n\nAccording to Twitch\u2019s guidelines, streamers are not allowed to have custom emotes that depict \u201csexualized torsos or bodily fluids,\u201d but Shift\u2019s emote was laughably un-sexual in nature and, if we really want to dive into the weeds and/or kelp of this one, didn\u2019t even include an actual butt \u2014 just a square backside and some torn pants.\n\nFortunately, it seems like this story might have a happy ending. Tuesday, Shift said on Twitter that his Twitch partner representative is trying to defuse the situation, and another Twitch staffer told him that his emote\u2019s exile should be short-lived. For now, however, the emote is still banned.\n\nKotaku reached out to Twitch for comment on all of these warnings and suspensions, but did not receive a reply as of this publishing.\n\nImage: Shift\n\nThese recent occurrences have caught the eyes of other streamers, who\u2019ve had to deal with Twitch\u2019s inconsistency and relative silence for years. At this point, they\u2019re pleading for change.\n\n\u201cHonestly, Twitch is just the most exhausting thing to try to understand,\u201d Rainbow Six, Overwatch, and Minecraft streamer Annemunition said on Twitter.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t draw 2D breasts on stream but you can literally get naked and put paint on your actual breasts and that\u2019s fine. For the record, I don\u2019t have a problem with either. But it just makes no sense. It just feels like you can get away with anything if you make Twitch enough money, and I hate it, even as someone who probably falls in that category. I don\u2019t have a solution, I\u2019m just annoyed with the way Twitch is handling everything the past few weeks.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really disappointing after the whole \u2018We\u2019re taking [terms of service] seriously now\u2019 thing last year,\u201d said Just Dance streamer Littlesiha in response, referring to Twitch\u2019s 2018 efforts to revamp its community guidelines and a now-notorious comment asking that streamers and viewers \u201chold us accountable.\u201d\n\nThese incidents have caused others to make note of hypocrisy not just on Twitch\u2019s part, but also within its community. \u201cTwitch bans female streamer for wearing revealing clothing, and the [Livestreamfail] community rejoices,\u201d said satirical streamer Kaceytron on Twitter. \u201cTwitch bans hentai and the LSF community is outraged. Figures.\u201d\n\nRegardless of what they\u2019re cheering for or against, however, pretty much everybody agrees that Twitch needs to give its approach to warnings, suspensions, dress codes, and other related subjects an overhaul. Maybe that means a series of set-in-stone specifics.\n\nMaybe that means a case law-like system where public precedents stemming from previous judgements inform future rulings. Whatever the case ends up being, the current system \u2014 overly vague and open to exploitation from bad actors \u2014 isn\u2019t working.\n\n\u201cIf people are getting banned for \u2018sexual content\u2019 with no further explanation, they could easily look at hundreds of other streamers doing so called \u2018sexual content\u2019 but not being banned, which might create resentment among their streamers and viewers, which I doubt is something Twitch is intending to do,\u201d said Devoue.\n\nAs for Fareeha, she may not feel like her probationary period is warranted, but she\u2019s at least trying to take it in stride.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve ordered several turtlenecks, ski masks and bodysuits,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve pulled off some tech tricks, and for the rest of my 90 day probation, I will cover myself up a ridiculous amount. Partially in protest, but mostly in good humour. I\u2019m going to make the most out of whatever they throw at me. They can\u2019t ban me for showing my body if I\u2019ve ascended and turned into a holographic AI head.\u201d", "description": "Earlier this week, Twitch suspended a streamer named Quqco for wearing a cosplay of Street Fighter heroine Chun-Li on stream, deeming her outfit \u201csexually suggestive.\u201d This took Quqco \u2014 and many others \u2014 by surprise, given that the outfit was not overtly risqu\u00e9.
