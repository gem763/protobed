Sullivan -- who owns about 6% of the company\u2019s shares through his F9 Investments LLC -- said he\u2019s already in talks with private equity and banks about a possible bid for the retailer. If he were successful, he\u2019d be interested in merging the chain with his current company Cabinets To Go, he said in an interview.\n\nLumber Liquidators shares jumped as much as 17% after the close of regular trading before paring gains.\n\nSullivan said the retailer and Chief Executive Officer Dennis Knowles have gotten away from the formula of low overhead and big marketing budgets that helped it become a nationwide chain. He took particular umbrage with the company building a new headquarters in Richmond, Virginia.\n\nSpending Money\n\n\u201cThey are spending money like crazy,\u201d he said, calling the board and the management \u201cpathetic.\u201d\n\nLumber Liquidators didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe company, which sells hardwood flooring and other home-renovation products, trimmed its full-year outlook when it reported earnings last month, noting softening customer traffic and an uncertain tariff environment. It now sees same-store sales -- a key gauge for retailers -- as flat for the year. Revenue is expected to grow in the low-single digits.\n\nManagement said at the time that \u201cwe are actively executing a deep dive into our overall cost structure to identify near-term efficiency opportunities.\u201d\n\nSagging Stock\n\nOver the years, Sullivan said he\u2019s been approached by private equity about partnering to buy Lumber Liquidators, but opted against that until now when a sagging stock price and complaints from current employees motivated him. The company\u2019s share price is down about 3% this year, even as the wider S&P 500 Index is up 16%.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always kind of thought about it, but when I saw the stock so low, I thought something has to happen here,\u201d Sullivan said. A building contractor, he founded the chain in 1994 and was CEO until 2006. He remained on the board until 2016.\n\nIf a deal doesn\u2019t take place, Sullivan said he would push for changes, such as boosting advertising and cutting back on corporate expenses.\n\n(Adds additional details)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Matt Townsend in New York at mtownsend9@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Anne Riley Moffat at ariley17@bloomberg.net, Jonathan Roeder\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Lumber Liquidators Holdings Inc.\u2019s founder is working on a bid to take the company private as he urges management to consider options for the chain, including a potential sale.Thomas D.
