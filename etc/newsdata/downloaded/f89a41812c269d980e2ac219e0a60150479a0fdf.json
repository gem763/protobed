Or the personal trainers, time dedicated to working out, personal chefs whipping up healthy meals, money, personal trainers. Oh, and don\u2019t forget the money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, obviously everyone was going wild for the image, as they took to the comments section with many a fire emoji.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nBecause Kris, quite frankly, is fire.\n\nThe throwback is no I Love My Friends \u2013 you know that spectacular song Kris recorded in the 80s as a tribute to her girl gang \u2013 but it\u2019s a start.\n\nWe\u2019re not sure if Kim is feeling super nostalgic recently, but the mogul has been living for the throwbacks as of late.\n\nAnother walk down memory lane (Picture: @kimkardashian)\n\nOn Sunday, alongside her older sister Kourtney, the ultra-glam TV personalities posted vintage snaps from their teenage years to Instagram, harking back to a time when fashions were different. Very different.\n\nOver on Kourtney\u2019s Instagram, the oldest Kardashian sibling shared an incredible photo of herself and her sibling on a family ski trip and everything about it screams \u2018pre-millenium\u2019.\n\nWearing her hair in a pink bandana (very X-Tina), the then 17-year-old Kourtney practices her smize for the camera while 16-year-old Kim sports an oversized hoodie that surely has to be the inspirations for Kanye\u2019s Yeezy collection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepresenting their status through rabbit emojis, Kourtney simply captioned the post: \u2018Circa 1996\u2019.\n\nOpting to show off the girls in their most glamourous party couture instead, Kim\u2019s photograph featured a fam holiday to Armenia in their teens, with Kourtney wearing a light blue plunging tshirt and Kim going for a white strapless dress.\n\nWhat a time to be alive.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
