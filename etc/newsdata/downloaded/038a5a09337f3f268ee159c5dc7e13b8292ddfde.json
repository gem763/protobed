She had travelled to Vernon, B.C., in late April, and that's the last time her family heard from her.\n\nFamily friend Dana Morenstein says Desjarlais's relatives are absolutely devastated.\n\n\"It's such a tragic ending, but I guess it's good to have closure for the family,\" said Morenstein, who is currently a spokesperson for the grief-stricken family.\n\nThe Desjarlais family is now working to get her body home for a funeral, on top of struggling to find answers to how she may have died.\n\nHow missing report was handled\n\nThe Vancouver Police Department confirmed to the CBC that the RCMP is now investigating the case.\n\nWhile family members are confident in the RCMP's current investigation, Morenstein said she's concerned with how Desjarlais's missing report initially was handled by the Vancouver Police Department.\n\n\"We never felt like they were taking her case seriously,\" Morenstein said.\n\nFamily friend Dana Morenstein says she's concerned with how Deanna Desjarlais' missing report was initially handled by the Vancouver Police Department. (Supplied) She added that the family also had a difficult time getting in touch with detectives for information, and said that Vancouver police did not release a picture of Desjarlais to the public nor was a missing person's bulletin on the RCMP website.\n\n\"It was like they were dismissing her case, because she is an Indigenous woman,\" said Morenstein.\n\nVancouver Police spokesman Randy Fincham took exception with that account.\n\n\"I can assure you that all missing persons cases reported to the VPD are thoroughly assessed to determine an appropriate police response,\" Fincham said in an email to CBC.\n\n\"That police response will be based on many factors. In the event that as a result of that assessment we determine that a missing person may be at risk, we will utilize a number of investigative techniques and utilize contacts with our community partners to locate that missing person.\"\n\nWhile Desjarlais was still missing, the Vancouver police, which was responsible for the case at the time, told the CBC it was making inquiries and tracking her travels to determine where she might be.\n\nFamily convinced Desjarlais was murdered\n\nThis week, Desjarlais's family learned from the RCMP that she was found in a wooded area without a path to it. At first, her badly decomposed body was difficult to identify, but eventually police were able to get a thumb print.\n\nMorenstein said, initially family members were worried her case would get swept under the rug by the RCMP.\n\nBut when Morenstein called the Surrey detachment, detectives said Desjarlais's death was in fact being investigated as suspicious. The B.C. Coroner's office told the CBC it could not comment on the case and that the RCMP are currently investigating.\n\nMorenstein says she will continue to put pressure on the police for answers, for justice for Desjarlais.\n\nWrote song about MMIW before she went missing\n\nMorenstein said Desjarlais and her five siblings had a difficult life growing up.\n\n\"They were just dealt a really rough hand,\" said Morenstein.\n\nBut her family and friends say she was vibrant, humorous and kind.\n\nDeanna Desjarlais 'was bright, bubbly, vivacious, a comedian and very happy-go-lucky,' says Cheryl L'Hirondelle. (Supplied)\n\nCheryl L'Hirondelle met Desjarlais at a women's group she led in Saskatchewan.\n\n\"She was bright, bubbly, vivacious, a comedian and very happy-go-lucky,\" L'Hirondelle said.\n\nThe seven women in the group decided to co-write a song dedicated to missing and murdered Indigenous women, after a woman from a previous group was found murdered.\n\n\"All of the women were quite torn up about it as you can imagine, so we decided to write a song about it,\" L'Hirondelle said.\n\nThe song is called Come my Sister Come, and L'Hirondelle says it's about how they as sisters needed to stand together and band together for change.\n\nFinding out about Desjarlais' death this week, the women in the group are devastated, she said.\n\n\"Hopefully people are touched by this enough, they know that this is wrong and must stop,\" L'Hirondelle said.", "description": "The body of a young Cree woman who went missing nearly five months ago was found this week in a wooded area in Surrey, B.C.
