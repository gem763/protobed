Parliament\u2019s opinion is nonbinding but seen as a politically necessary step for the appointment.\n\nFollowing the plenary vote, EU leaders are set to officially unveil Lagarde as the next ECB boss when they meet in Brussels in October for a summit. ECB President Mario Draghi steps down on October 31, when his eight-year term comes to an end.\n\nECON on Wednesday also backed ECB Executive Board Member Yves Mersch to become the vice chair of the central bank\u2019s supervisory board in Frankfurt. Mersch secured 35 votes in favor of his nomination, 14 against and four abstentions.\n\nThe opinion on Mersch will also need rubberstamping in the plenary later this month.", "description": "", "authors": ["Bjarke Smith-Meyer"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1165932354-1200x628.jpg"}
