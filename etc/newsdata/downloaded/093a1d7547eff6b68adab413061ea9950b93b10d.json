They won a Pulitzer Prize in 2013 \u2014 and within months the infant mortality rate dropped. As someone married to a pediatrician and committed to investing in solving health challenges, I found this to be a powerful example of how journalism can help us make progress on our biggest issues.\n\nI know what it\u2019s like to be the subject of reporting. I did my first interview at 19, and while I\u2019ve gotten a little better at talking to journalists, people tell me I\u2019m still not exactly a natural. Over the past 15 years, I\u2019ve seen how the news has held Facebook accountable when we\u2019ve made mistakes. This can be uncomfortable, but as I often tell Facebook\u2019s employees, this kind of scrutiny is important: Facebook is part of so many people\u2019s lives, and we have a responsibility to engage with good-faith criticism and use it to get better. Newspapers have broken important stories that have changed the way we operate, and ultimately that\u2019s better not only for our company, but also for society.\n\nGreat journalism surfaces stories that wouldn\u2019t have otherwise been uncovered, and it establishes the ground truth that helps us make progress on important issues. It also holds the powerful accountable. A free press is critical to a healthy democracy, and we need to support the journalists and publishers who do this critical work.\n\nBut the internet disrupted the business model for much of the news industry. When ads started moving from print newspapers to websites, the economics of news changed. Some effects have been positive. Internet services gave news outlets ways to reach new audiences, and research suggests people who get their news on social networks are exposed to a wider range of viewpoints. But breaking the link between publishers and their readers has also made it harder for the news industry to adapt financially to these changes.", "description": "Advertising revenue that used to support journalism now goes to companies like mine.
