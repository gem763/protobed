This 1987 RX-7 is an exception, however, as it remains in amazing condition, and even more remarkable, this is no low-mileage garage queen. With 75,000 miles on the odometer, this RX-7 has obviously been driven and enjoyed, but it has also been babied by the single family that has owned it since 1987.\n\nWhat makes the RX-7 special is its naturally aspirated Wankel rotary engine, and in true enthusiast fashion, this one has a five-speed manual transmission. In addition to the low miles and one-family ownership, the listing says that this car is \"mostly original,\" but it's hard to spot any major changes. This car still has the factory AM/FM/cassette radio and five-spoke aluminum wheels (although the rear wheels are installed in the wrong direction), and it has features such as air power windows, cruise control and a sunroof.\n\nThe Mazda RX-7 was at the forefront of the JDM sports car surge that peaked in the 1990s, and this clean, low-mileage 1987 RX-7 is an amazing example. This 1987 Mazda RX-7 will be up for grabs at the Winter 2019 Raleigh Classic on December 6 - 7, so be sure you're registered to bid if you want a shot at being the winning bidder on this '80s JDM sports car or any of the other classic and collectible vehicles that will be crossing the auction block.\n\nMore From Raleigh Classic Car Auctions...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Most of these RX-7s were modded and abused back in the day; not this one!Japanese sports cars started becoming a huge hit in the U.S. in the 1980s, and one shining reason was the presence of the Mazda RX-7.
