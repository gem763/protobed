Unfortunately, they\u2019re not precisely 45 degrees. That\u2019s because the entire 170 year old building isn\u2019t completely square. The tradies who built it didn\u2019t have the advantages of modern tools, so Keith and Dan\u2019s team have had to make their own adjustments as they put in the various additions. If they didn\u2019t adjust, the entire new veranda would be hanging out to the side of the building.\n\nUnfortunately for Jesse, he and his carpenter didn\u2019t heed Dan\u2019s warning to double check the joint and now Jesse wants compensation for his carpenter\u2019s four wasted hours \u2014 $600 to be precise.\n\nJesse says it\u2019s a mistake not of his making. And it is, but it\u2019s a mistake made by a long dead chippie, and Scott Cam is in no mood to foot the bill for his historical colleague.\n\nJesse complains the job hasn\u2019t been done right, and he is the victim, Cam tells Jesse he shouldn\u2019t have gone ahead and cut all his boards before double checking, and the impasse ends with Cam saying \u201cStop, stop, stop. I said stop! You let me speak right! You\u2019re not even listening. This is the end of the story. As for I\u2019m going to pay your bill, I\u2019m paying nothing, mate. You get it done and you get it done right.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Mark and Mitch\u2019s builder has immediately seen the need to improvise around the slightly off hip joint and adjusted his cuts accordingly. As if Mark and Mitch needed any more reasons to be smug.\n\nThat pair really reveal their nasty streak in this episode.\n\nThey\u2019re bitter that their former mates Tess and Luke said no to them having a spa on their outside deck, and after having spent the entire season denying that their party floor will have any impact on their neighbours\u2019 master bedroom \u2014 which shares a wall with the aforementioned private nightclub \u2014 they\u2019re now taking great delight in crowing about the fact it will make life unbearable for whoever buys Tess and Luke\u2019s house.\n\nThey\u2019re putting a huge dining table and in-built speaker system in their veranda, just outside Tess and Luke\u2019s masterbedroom.\n\n\u201cFor a nice 16 person dinner party, lots of conversation, laughing their heads off, after a few red wines the music goes up. There\u2019s a master next door. Oh well! And they thought that a spa motor was going to be a problem,\u201d Mitch says, in a mean-spirited diatribe that really does him no credit, particularly given Tess and Luke really are this season\u2019s Bambi and Thumper.\n\nMitch had earlier tipped a bucket on Tess and Luke\u2019s winning studio room from last week.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Mitch says. \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute joke.\u201d\n\nThe other teams disagree, complimenting the pair for putting a full kitchen in and making good opportunity of the separate entrance.\n\nMind you when Tess and Luke inspect Mark and Mitch\u2019s room \u2014 which would have tied for first place if Tess and Luke hadn\u2019t used their bonus point \u2014 she\u2019s equally uncomplimentary, parking herself on their toilet saying \u201cThank god because I need a poo, and what better place to do a poo than somewhere you\u2019ve been shat all over.\u201d\n\nShe follows it up by miming wiping her bum with one of Mitch and Mark\u2019s towels.\n\nShe might be Bambi, but nobody would ever accuse of her being classy.\n\nMISSED AN EPISODE?\n\n\n\nEP 41 recap: Room brings Shaynna Blaze to tears\n\n\n\nEP 39/40 recap: Tess and Luke finally run out of cash\n\n\n\nEP 38 recap: Mark and Mitch blow their stacks\n\nEP 37 recap: Will Tess and Luke walk out?\n\n\n\nEP 35 and 36 recap: Reason for Tess and Luke\u2019s devastation\n\nEP 34 recap: Mitch puts his foot through the ceiling\n\nEP 32 recap: producer dragged into cheating scandal\n\n\n\nEP 30 recap: \u2018Dog\u2019s breakfast\u2019: kitchen savagely mocked\n\nEP 29 recap: Scott Cam gives contestants a serve\n\nEP 27/28 recap: Gloves are off as teams threaten to quit\n\nEP 26 recap: Tess and Luke flush another tradie\n\nEP 25 recap: Is this the best bathroom on the Block ever?\n\nEP 24 recap: Is this the best Block bathroom ever?\n\nEP 23 recap: \u2018I\u2019m so sorry\u201d \u2014 Mark and Mitch patch things up with Scott\n\n\n\nEP 22 recap: What made Scott Cam storm off?\n\nEP 21 recap: Homophobia row rocks The Block\n\n\n\nEP 19/ 20 recap: \u2018you just told me my baby is ugly\u2019\n\nEP 18 recap: Tess\u2019 expletive-filled tirade after tradie sacking\n\nEP 17 recap: Loo controversy sinks two teams\n\nEP 15/16 recap: What made Mitch snap?\n\nEP 14 recap: Jesse and Keith\u2019s blow up\n\nEP 13 recap: Judges slam Mark and Mitch\n\nEP 11/12: Big move may blow up friendship\n\nEP 10 recap: Why Scott Cam locked a contestant in car\n\nEP 9 recap: How Jesse insulted Shaynna\n\nEP 7/8: \u2018Don\u2019t be nice to them\u2019.
