Seven people were arrested.\n\nThe main suspect in the long-running investigation that led to raids on Thursday is a 59-year-old Dutchman who authorities believe acquired the former military bunker in Traben-Trarbach, a picturesque town on the Mosel River in western Germany, in 2013, prosecutor Juergen Bauer told reporters.\n\nHe then turned it into a very large and heavily secured data processing center \u201cin order to make it available to clients, according to our investigations, exclusively for illegal purposes,\u201d Bauer added. Regional criminal police chief Johannes Kunz said that authorities believe he had \u201clinks to organized crime,\u201d and that he appears to have spent most of his time in the area although he was registered as having moved to Singapore.\n\nThirteen people aged 20 to 59 are under investigation in all, including three German and seven Dutch citizens, Brauer said.\n\nAuthorities arrested seven of them, citing the danger of flight and collusion. They are suspected of membership in a criminal organization because of a tax offense, as well as being accessories to hundreds of thousands of offenses involving drugs, counterfeit money and forged documents, and accessories to the distribution of child pornography. Authorities didn\u2019t name any of the suspects.\n\nThe data center was set up as what investigators described as a \u201cbulletproof hoster,\u201d meant to conceal illicit activities from authorities\u2019 eyes.\n\nInvestigators say the platforms it hosted included \u201cCannabis Road,\u201d a drug-dealing portal; the \u201cWall Street Market,\u201d which was one of the world\u2019s largest online criminal marketplaces for drugs, hacking tools and financial-theft wares until it was taken down earlier this year; and sites such as \u201cOrange Chemicals\u201d that dealt in synthetic drugs. A botnet attack on German telecommunications company Deutsche Telekom in late 2016 that knocked out about 1 million customers\u2019 routers also appears to have come from the data center in Traben-Trarbach, Brauer said.\n\nThe arrests took place at a restaurant in the town and in Schwalbach, outside Frankfurt. Alongside the raids in Germany, there were searches in the Netherlands, Poland and Luxembourg.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a huge success \u2026 that we were able at all to get police forces into the bunker complex, which is still secured at the highest military level,\u201d Kunz said. \u201cWe had to overcome not only real, or analog, protections; we also cracked the digital protections of the data center.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "German investigators said Friday they have shut down a data processing center installed in a former NATO bunker that hosted sites dealing in drugs and other illegal activities.
