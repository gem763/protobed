Milner-Brown, 64, is a writer from north London with four daughters and eight grandchildren, who has likewise chosen to become a full-time climate change activist.\n\nExtinction Rebellion protesters march semi-naked through Melbourne. Paul Jeffers\n\nNeither woman has ever been in trouble before, and knew they would be courting arrest. Both tell me they have left distraught offspring behind. Both were scared, but they felt they had no choice.\n\n\u201cWhat are you going to say to your children and grandchildren 20 or 30 years from now when the world is in a nightmare apocalyptic state, facing death, famine, drought, floods and fires?\u201d Milner-Brown asks. \u201cWhat are you going to say when violence is infiltrating your children\u2019s lives because people are migrating to find food and water and are prepared to kill and loot? What are you going to say about what you did at that time when you could have saved them?\u201d\n\n\u201cI refuse to bequeath a dying world to future generations by failing to act now,\u201d Davidsen adds. \u201cWe are the smoke alarms trying to wake everyone up. Are you really going to bash your smoke alarm and say, \u2018How dare you wake me up in the middle of the night\u2019 when it\u2019s just saved your life?\u201d\n\nIn the event, Milner-Brown and Davidsen never reached Heathrow. They were arrested that same afternoon, along with five of Heathrow Pause\u2019s ringleaders, and charged with conspiracy to cause a public nuisance. They spent the night in police custody.\n\nRoger Hallam, 53, a co-founder of Extinction Rebellion and its strategic mastermind, is one of those ringleaders. A tall, gaunt man with grey hair tied back in a ponytail, he was finally released on bail late the following evening, still determined to fly a drone near Heathrow the next day, for reasons he had explained to me in characteristically apocalyptic terms earlier in the week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA climate activist waves a flag between the Reichstagsbuilding and a camp they have pitched next to the Chancellery in Berlin on October 9. Getty\n\n\u201cHeathrow is the iconic symbol of carbon-intensive monstrosity, and the [new] third runway will be the largest carbon-intensive infrastructure project in Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cThe carbon emissions will be the equivalent of those of Kenya ... The British government is engaged in a project which is going to lead to the tropics being uninhabitable for most of the year, and that constitutes mass genocide.\u201d\n\nOn the Saturday morning, journalists who want to witness Hallam flying his drone in blatant violation of his bail conditions receive a WhatsApp message instructing us to go to Stanwell village hall, in the sprawl of industrial and housing estates that ring Heathrow. We are then given co-ordinates for a site a seven-minute walk away, where we find Hallam sitting cross-legged on a grassy roadside verge with a pile of new books beside him and a new toy drone from Selfridges still in its box.\n\nAlmost simultaneously, two police vans arrive and arrest him a second time. Hallam tells them he won't resist, but will not stand up, so eight officers carry him \u2013 and his books \u2013 to one of the vehicles, which takes him away.\n\nReturning to Stanwell we find another Heathrow Pause protester holding a drone aloft as a couple of police officers look on. \u201cI have been flying a drone this morning and you should be arresting me,\u201d Anthony Whitehouse, 67, a retired IT worker from Yorkshire, tells them.\n\nProtesters in Brisbane on October 10. AAP\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing this because I have no choice. The climate emergency that\u2019s going on will cause huge disruption to society and the possible extinction of people,\u201d he says as the officers consult their superiors by radio. Then they drive him away as well \u2013 one of two dozen arrested over the course of a week. Another is detained after holding up a drone without batteries or propellers.\n\nOn the face of it, the Heathrow Pause protest failed. It tied up hundreds of police officers, but came nowhere close to shutting Heathrow down, and caused no disruption to passengers \u2013 unlike the British Airways pilots\u2019 strike on September 27.\n\nThe organisers see it differently. They gained a lot of publicity in the mainstream and on social media. They highlighted the contradiction between the government\u2019s pledge to cut carbon emissions to net zero by 2050 and its approval of the third runway, and the hypocrisy of a prime minister who once vowed to lie in front of the bulldozers to prevent the third runway being built. \u201cThe goal was to recharge and ignite the discussion about Heathrow and the third runway, and I think we\u2019ve managed that,\u201d says a spokesperson.\n\nActivists from Extinction Rebellion dressed as bees take part in a die-in protest in Sydney. AAP\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRoger Hallam will have his day in court, moreover. Appearing before Uxbridge Magistrates Court on September 16, he declined to apply for bail and was remanded in custody. He appeared before Isleworth Crown Court by videoconference on October 14. When his case gets to trial, he is expected to invoke the seldom-used \u201cnecessity defence\u201d, hoping to persuade a jury that his actions were a proportionate response to the climate emergency given the government\u2019s failure to protect the population.\n\nDuring the Great Fire of London, he had explained to me, \u201cpeople pulled down buildings in London to stop the fire spreading. That\u2019s destruction of property, but they didn\u2019t ask permission. They pulled them down to save life and limb in an emergency.\u201d\n\nOutside the magistrates court another would-be protester approaches Hallam\u2019s supporters, asking what she can do. Her name is Margaret Turner, a grandmother and retired mental health worker two weeks shy of her 80th birthday. She has come from Exeter, armed not with a drone but with a toy glider and an apron proclaiming \u201cNo Third Runway!\u201d\n\nShe has never done anything like this before, she says, but \u201cthe threat to life on our planet is so huge that anything I can do to change the direction of our culture towards disaster I must do\u201d.\n\nProtesters apply makeup before a blockade in London on October 7. AP\n\nRoger Hallam was born in Manchester, the son of a Co-op factory manager and a part-time teacher. His parents were staunch Methodists who taught him, he says, that \u201cthe main point of life is not to make money but to live a life of righteousness\u201d.\n\nFrom Bredbury Comprehensive he won a scholarship to the London School of Economics, but left after a year \u201cbecause I thought I could study more effectively by myself\u201d. He explored Gandhi and peace activism. He spent several years in Birmingham pursuing radical experiments in housing, labour and education. \u201cHow to organise people \u2013 that\u2019s basically what I specialise in,\u201d he says. He also set up a business buying produce from farmers and selling it directly to households because \u201cfarmers were getting screwed by supermarkets\u201d.\n\nIn 1999, he moved to Carmarthen in Wales \u201cbecause I was f---ed off with society. It\u2019s not my cup of tea \u2026 If people want to consume stuff and compete with each other that\u2019s fine but it\u2019s not my deal.\u201d There he grew organic vegetables on a 6 hectare plot, successfully replicated the direct sales business he had run in Birmingham, and raised four children \u2013 two boys and two girls, now aged eight to 19. Then, two years running, his crops were ruined by weeks of non-stop rain that he attributed to climate change, so he switched direction.\n\nProtesters in Prague, Czech Republic. AP\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe went back to university and studied politics part-time at Swansea. That led to a PhD at King\u2019s College London on how to bring about radical political change through direct action. His studies were practical, not theoretical. He helped organise a successful rent strike by students at University College London, fought for the rights of Deliveroo and other casual workers, and forced King\u2019s to divest from fossil fuel companies.\n\nOne day he had an epiphany when he heard an announcement about rising global temperatures while driving back to Wales and realised climate change was real and deadly serious. He broke down in tears.\n\nIt was, he says, \u201clike finding out about your own death. That\u2019s when I knew the rest of my life was definitely going to be on the climate crisis. I moved away from doing the labour-organising thing, which I love, because it\u2019s great fun taking down capitalists. I don\u2019t want to do this type of work really because it\u2019s so traumatising for everyone involved. It\u2019s enormously emotionally upsetting.\n\n\u201cWith climate change it\u2019s like everything you ever loved is going to get destroyed. Your children are going to die of starvation. What we need to do is completely transform the economy in five years, and take carbon out of the atmosphere, and even if we do that we are almost certainly going to go extinct. As a reasonably intelligent analyst that\u2019s the reality. That\u2019s not nice on any level.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, Hallam met Gail Bradbrook, a molecular biophysicist and fellow campaigner for social change. They helped start the radical campaigning organisation Rising Up!, which spawned Extinction Rebellion in the spring of 2018.\n\nProtesters outside H&M in Santiago, Chile on October 11. AP\n\nExtinction Rebellion was a recognition that conventional environmental campaigning, with its lobbying, petitioning and reluctance to frighten people, had largely failed: the world has emitted as much carbon in the past 30 years as in the previous two centuries. A new model was needed \u2013 mass, non-violent civil disobedience based on three principles that Hallam succinctly expressed in a Guardian article: \u201cFirst, that only through disruption, the breaking of laws, do you get the attention that you need. Second, only through sacrifice \u2013 the willingness to be arrested and go to prison \u2013 do people take seriously what you\u2019re saying. And third, only through being respectful to ourselves, the public and the police do we change the hearts and minds of our opponents.\u201d\n\nOr, as he puts it: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen 30 years of well-meaning, very passionate action which has totally failed. Now we\u2019re at the shit point of whatever it takes.\u201d\n\nXR set out to alarm, disrupt and force people to confront what Hallam calls \u201cthe most important issue in the history of humanity\u201d. It deployed apocalyptic language and imagery. It adopted the hour-glass symbol as its logo, to suggest time running out, and issued three demands: the government must tell the truth about the climate emergency, cut carbon emissions to net zero by 2025, and create a Citizens\u2019 Assembly \u2013 immune from lobbyists\u2019 pressure \u2013 to oversee that monumental task. XR does not say how carbon emissions could be cut so drastically, but that target would clearly entail revolutionary changes to our present lifestyles.\n\nFormer WA Greens senator Scott Ludlam addresses the Perth Extinction Rebellion crowd. Daile Cross\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHallam, Bradbrook and others spent that summer giving recruitment talks around the country. On October 31 last year, a thousand supporters blocked the road outside the Houses of Parliament while Extinction Rebellion issued its \u201cDeclaration of Rebellion\u201d against the government\u2019s \u201ccriminal inaction in the face of climate change catastrophe and ecological collapse\u201d.\n\nA series of escalating protests followed, culminating in last Easter\u2019s \u201cInternational Rebellion\u201d when several thousand protesters occupied five sites in central London, including Oxford Circus and Marble Arch, for 11 festive days. More than 1100 people were arrested.\n\nXR\u2019s disruption of the capital was decried by much of the media, but it caught the zeitgeist. The following month parliament approved a motion that declared a climate emergency. The school strikes inspired by Greta Thunberg gathered momentum. Climate change shot up the list of people\u2019s concerns in opinion polls, and is now one of the top three. Academics endorsed XR, and Emma Thompson, Rowan Williams and members of Radiohead lent their support.\n\nThe number of \u201crebels\u201d signed up with XR soared from 34,000 before the Easter Rebellion to more than 150,000 now, of which about 20,000 have declared their willingness to be arrested. Donations poured in. \u201cIt\u2019s like living a dream and living a nightmare at the same time,\u201d Gail Bradbrook says.\n\nFor the most part these grass-roots rebels are not people the tabloids could easily characterise as anarchists or left-wing extremists. While researching this article I met many ordinary citizens, of every age and background, who have never challenged the law before but are deeply alarmed by the increasingly irrefutable evidence that the planet is overheating. More than one choked up as they envisaged their children\u2019s future.\n\nThey are encouraged to attend non-violent direct action training courses where they are warned of the legal consequences if arrested, and advised how to act in a way that suggests self-sacrifice and therefore garners public sympathy \u2013 don\u2019t resist but go limp, and don\u2019t link arms.\n\nDoctors join the London protest. PA\n\nThey are taught the importance of respect. \u201cIf we go round saying the general public are c----s because they won\u2019t do the right thing you can guarantee that people will hate us,\u201d says Hallam. \u201cIf we say, \u2018We\u2019re really sorry about closing Oxford Street, it\u2019s the last thing we want to do but we\u2019re just normal people and we\u2019re shit scared and if the police arrest us that\u2019s fine by us,\u2019 that shows first of all respect and second fearlessness, which are the two main components of creating attitude change in the observer.\u201d\n\nI sit in on a course near Euston Station attended by two dozen people aged 15 to 54, male and female, articulate and educated, few of whom had been activists of any sort before. \u201cIt bothers the hell out of me. I look at my son and think, \u2018What kind of future have I left you?\u2019,\u201d Elaine Clarke, 49, a recently retired primary school teacher, says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe rebels are encouraged to form local \u201caffinity groups\u201d, which can stage any type of protest so long as it complies with XR\u2019s fundamental rules \u2013 no violence, no disrespect, no shirking of responsibility for one\u2019s actions, and no drugs or alcohol.\n\nAnd that is what the rebels have been doing all this northern summer. As the world witnessed a succession of extreme climatic events \u2013 record temperatures in Europe and North America, unprecedented wildfires and ice loss in the Arctic, record droughts in Australia, Hurricane Dorian \u2013 XR groups have been staging all manner of protests in towns and cities. They have been blocking roads, glueing themselves to totemic buildings, staging boycotts and \u201cdie-ins\u201d.\n\nExtinction Rebellion\u2019s headquarters occupy a bright, open-plan office in a modern block in Bethnal Green, east London. The walls are adorned with colourful posters declaring \u201cChange is Now\u201d and \u201cRebel for Life\u201d. There are sections for regenerative culture, media and messaging, well-being, legal advisers, art, fund-raising and much else besides.\n\nThe place crackles with energy. Between breaks for therapeutic dancing and meditation, and communal vegan lunches, dozens of volunteers \u2013 many of whom quit well-paid jobs to devote themselves to the cause after experiencing their own \u201cecophanies\u201d \u2013 are busily preparing for another huge \u201cRebellion\u201d which began on October 7.\n\nThe Easter Rebellion in April occupied five sites around London. This \u201cOctober Rebellion\u201d occupied 12 sites in a circle around the Palace of Westminster and the ministries of Whitehall, blockading the very heart of government for two weeks.\n\nIt is a huge undertaking. There will be stages, art installations and other physical structures at each site. There will be music, talks, workshops and free meals. There will be cooks, messengers, stewards, police liaisons, first aiders, and live-streamers working in shifts. There will be people offering legal support to those who volunteer to be arrested, and people ready to greet those arrested when they are released on bail. \u201cFor every one arrestee, there will be 20 supporting them,\u201d says Sophie Cowen, 28, who gave up her advertising job to work as a \u201cmedia and messaging co-ordinator\u201d for XR.\n\nProtesters blocked the Spencer and Collins street intersection in Melbourne. Jason South\n\nThe police may seek to remove the protesters by force in a way they refrained from doing in April, but that would play into XR\u2019s hands. \u201cEither they let us stay on the streets and we do the disruption and get the publicity,\u201d says Bradbrook, \u201cor they clamp down on us and we\u2019re not running off. If they come at us with tear gas or batons or mass arrests then you get a kind of upswell because they become repressive of people demanding what the public actually want.\u201d\n\nRoger Hallam was not there, of course. He was in a cell in Wormwood Scrubs, awaiting trial, reading books and doubtless contemplating what he calls the \u201cannihilation event\u201d hurtling towards us \u2013 the point where the heating up of the planet becomes irreversible.\n\nHe is not optimistic. He does what he does not because he thinks it will work, but because it is the right thing to do. \u201cWe\u2019re f---ed,\u201d he told me several times, and put the chances of his children reaching his age at \u201csomewhere between 2 and 20 per cent\u201d.\n\nStanley Johnson, father of the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, speaks at an Extinction Rebellion panel in London on October 9. AP\n\n\u201cNo one is saying we\u2019ve not made progress but we are approaching the foothills,\u201d he says. \u201cRead some history. Look at the rise of Islam. Look at the rise of Christianity. That\u2019s what we are looking at here.\u201d It is too late merely to change a few policies \u2013 \u201cyou can\u2019t preserve the geophysical composition of the planet through a few government policies\u201d. To save humankind there needs to be a revolution, \u201ca massive social and political and spiritual transformation\u201d, and even that might no longer be enough.\n\nFond of analogies, Hallam likens humanity\u2019s plight to someone reaching a very high wall as a gunman chases him. He has no chance of scaling it, but a faint chance of escaping if he can somehow find a ladder. \u201cThere\u2019s a zero per cent chance of saving us through conventional activism,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a 1 per cent chance through the ladder option.\u201d That ladder is what he believes Extinction Rebellion provides.\n\nNew Statesman", "description": "Here's how economic school dropout and failed farmer Roger Hallam founded and grew a global protest organisation in just 18 months.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3808%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_227%2C$y_265/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/6e4e1692cad63f68e8b0d83fc90e38a2b51e183f", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
