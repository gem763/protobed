Frustrations over the high cost of living in Santiago have become a political flashpoint, prompting calls for reforms on everything from the country\u2019s tax and labor codes to its pension system.\n\nEnel Chile, a subsidiary of Italian utility Enel, said vandals had set fire to the company\u2019s high-rise corporate headquarters downtown. Local television footage showed flames climbing up the side of the building as fire crews struggled to break through growing crowds of protesters.\n\nThe company said in a statement posted on Twitter that workers had been evacuated safely from the site.\n\nHigh school and university students began the protests after the government hiked fares on Oct. 6 to as much as $1.17 for a peak metro ride, blaming higher energy costs and a weaker peso.\n\nThe protests turned increasingly violent on Friday afternoon, however, and by early evening, officials had closed down all of the city\u2019s 136 metro stations, which connect more than 87 miles of track.\n\nThe metro system will remain closed through the weekend, with officials saying \u201cserious destruction\u201d made it impossible to operate trains safely.\n\nDemonstrators clanging pots and honking horns clashed with police armed with batons and tear gas all across the normally subdued city late into Friday evening.\n\nMetro management said there had been more than 200 incidents on Santiago\u2019s subway system in the previous 11 days, mostly involving school children and older students jumping barriers and forcing gates.\n\nEarlier on Friday, after a meeting with the metro chief and interior minister, Transport Minister Gloria Hutt told reporters the fare hike would not be reversed. She said the government subsidizes almost half the operating costs of the metro, one of Latin America\u2019s most modern.\n\n\u201cThis is not a discussion that should have risen to the level of violence that we\u2019ve seen,\u201d she said.", "description": "Chile's President Sebastian Pinera declared a state of emergency in the capital Santiago early on Saturday, as the city of 6 million descended into chaos amid riots that left a downtown building engulfed in flames and its metro system shuttered.", "authors": ["Dave Sherwood", "Aislinn Laing", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442565539&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I04E-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
