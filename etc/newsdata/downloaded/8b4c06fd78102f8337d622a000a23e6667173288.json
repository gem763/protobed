Is Kawhi Leonard going to lead the Los Angeles Clippers to glory?\n\nThe question on everybody's lips. It's hard to argue against this narrative though, with this Los Angeles Clippers side far better than the Raptors team he inspired to victory last season.\n\nUnder head coach Doc Rivers the unfancied Clippers took, the-then defending champions, the Golden State Warriors to six games in their Western Conference first-round play-off series last term. The core of that Clippers side remains intact with Patrick Beverley, Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell. However, now you add Kawhi Leonard and perennial All-Star Paul George, who will miss the start of the season due to injury, to the mix - making them a deep team with star power too.\n\nKawhi Leonard (right) is deemed by many as the best NBA player in the world after last season\n\nThe Clippers have a formidable starting five with a bench to boost. It'll be a shock if they don't have a deep run in the play-offs this season, let alone go all the way.\n\nThey have never even played in a Conference Finals, but they're the favourites of both oddsmakers and NBA general managers. With Leonard and George on the wings, a potent bench and one of the league's best coaches in Rivers, it's easy to see why.\n\nThe Western Conference may be stacked full of excellent teams but they are certainly at the top of the pile with the reigning NBA Finals MVP in their ranks. Their credentials will be immediately tested with a mouthwatering opening clash against the LA Lakers on Tuesday night.\n\nNew recruits Leonard and Paul George are expected to lead the Los Angeles Clippers to glory\n\n\ud83d\udea8 THE NBA SEASON STARTS TONIGHT! \ud83d\udea8 pic.twitter.com/feMQ0HPeKV \u2014 NBA UK (@NBAUK) October 22, 2019\n\n2. What about their neighbours, the Los Angeles Lakers with LeBron James and Anthony Davis?\n\nLEBRON JAMES THE RECORD-CHASER LeBron James is nearing several milestones. He's 1,101 points from passing Kobe Bryant for No. 3 on the all-time regular-season scoring list, is two games away from becoming the 40th player in league history with 1,200 appearances, and two starts from passing Bryant again for No. 10 on the career games-started list with 1,199. He's also 522 field-goal tries away from 24,000, and will be the sixth player in league history to get there.\n\nIf the Clippers don't emerge victorious with the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy then that is likely to be down to their 'big brother' just down the hallway in the Staples Center that they both share.\n\nLos Angeles will always be a Laker town. Their total of 16 NBA titles won is more than any other franchise, but they haven't made the play-offs since 2013. Considering they've reached the post season a total of 49 times in their 59-year history - this six-year absence highlights their decline.\n\nThat was all due to change with the signing of LeBron James last season but an injury-hit campaign for the three-time champion derailed that ambition. Now the 34-year-old has six-time All-Star Anthony Davis alongside him to restore the Purple and Gold to past glories. In Danny Green, Quinn Cook and Troy Daniels they have also added some much-needed perimeter shooting too.\n\nJames and Davis have shown what a devastating combination they're going to be already during pre-season. They averaged a combined 27.8 points, 10.3 rebounds and 10.1 assists in just 20.3 minutes per game. But what makes it more frightening for the rest of the league is that they will only get better. James averaged 27.4 points, 8.5 rebounds and 8.3 assists per game on his own last season. Meanwhile, Davis averaged 25.9 points, 12 rebounds and 2.4 blocks per game with the New Orleans Pelicans.\n\nLeBron James (left) and Anthony Davis will be hoping to restore the LA Lakers back to the top\n\nIn pre-season they averaged 27.8 points and 10.1 assists in just 20.3 minutes per game\n\n3. The Golden State Warriors have dominated the NBA landscape recently, what are their chances?\n\nTHREE AND EASY FOR STEPHEN CURRY Golden State's Stephen Curry is about to become NO 2 on the league's all-time 3-pointers made list. Curry enters this season with 2,483 made 3-pointers, leaving him 78 away from passing Reggie Miller for No. 2 on the list. That will leave only Ray Allen - 2,973 - ahead of Curry.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors have may have lost heavily three times to the Lakers in pre-season but there are caveats to this. Quite simply the Warriors starting team now won't contain the same personnel come the business end of the regular season.\n\nFor starters, the iconic 'Splash Brothers' backcourt partnership is halved for now due to Klay Thompson's knee injury. The 29-year-old tore his ACL in his left knee during Game 6 of the NBA Finals against the Raptors in June and is not expected back for the most of the regular season.\n\nThompson's injury is a major blow to Steve Kerr's side due to his elite defence and spectacular three-point shooting - something that's been felt in the pre-season. The loss of Kevin Durant, who moved to the Brooklyn Nets, will be keenly felt too.\n\nKlay Thompson (left) will miss the majority of the regular season due to a ACL left knee injury\n\nWARRIORS ON A ROLL Golden State's NBA Finals streak is the second-longest in NBA history, behind only the 10 straight trips by the Boston Celtics from 1957-66. The Warriors' hopes of extending it could depend largely on the play of guard D'Angelo Russell, an All-Star last season in Brooklyn who was acquired when Durant went to the Nets.\n\nHowever, in Stephen Curry they have the only unanimous MVP in NBA history. Expect him to carry the attacking burden and lead the league in scoring. He is the engine of the team alongside the emotional leader that is Draymond Green. These two, Thompson and Kerr have all been a part of their run of five-straight NBA Finals appearances.\n\nThey may finish in the lower half of the play-off positions but nobody will want to face them. After being written off by many, the Warriors are relishing their underdogs tag.\n\nHowever, the Golden State Warriors still have Stephen Curry (right) in their ranks\n\n4. So how will the Brooklyn Nets fair then even without Kevin Durant?\n\nDEAD-EYE DEANDRE Among players with 2,000 field goals in NBA history, Brooklyn's DeAndre Jordan has the best shooting percentage of anyone - .670 entering this season, well ahead of second-place Artis Gilmore's .599. To put that in perspective: If Jordan took 554 shots this season and missed every one of them, he'd still be ahead of Gilmore.\n\nKevin Durant's move to the Brooklyn Nets stunned the basketball world this summer as he chose them over the New York Knicks or to remain at Golden State. His arrival to the Barclays Center alongside Kyrie Irving has whet the appetite for great things to happen in Brooklyn. However, we won't see Durant this season after suffering a devastating right achilles tendon tear during Game 5 of the NBA Finals.\n\nThe loss of Durant is an insurmountable blow, but the Nets still have a champion in their ranks in Irving - who won the NBA title with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2016. He'll lead a team that possess Caris LeVert and Spencer Dinwiddie within their ranks and the newly-acquired DeAndre Jordan at center.\n\nA play-off run to the second-round will probably be their aim but it all boils down to how they gel team-chemistry wise. Head coach Kenny Atkinson will be working with 13 new faces, while veteran leaders like DeMarre Carroll, Ed Davis and Jared Dudley have all gone.\n\nKevin Durant shook the NBA world when he joined the Brooklyn Nets as a free agent in July\n\nPoint guard Kyrie Irving was another All-Star addition to the Nets during the off-season\n\n5. Sticking with the East, will it all click for the Philadelphia 76ers at last?\n\nA lot of reflecting will have been done in Philadelphia this summer. They were one bounce of the ball away from playing in the Eastern Conference Finals if it wasn't for that shot by Kawhi Leonard.\n\nThe agonising seven-game series defeat by the Raptors reduced 76ers center Joel Embiid to tears and has only made him more determined than ever.\n\nJoel Embiid will be keen to atone for the Philadelphia 76ers heartbreaking post-season exit\n\nJimmy Butler and JJ Redick have left but head coach Brett Brown has bolstered his side with the notable addition of Al Horford - the one big that Embiid has never really got the measure of.\n\nA lot of eyes will be on Ben Simmons too and whether or not he can develop any sort of mid-court/perimeter shooting. The fact he started taking them this pre-season is a positive sign in itself.\n\nWith the Eastern Conference nowhere on par with the West, expect them to reach the Finals.\n\nA lot will depend on Ben Simmons (left) though - who needs to develop his shooting range\n\n6. How will the Toronto Raptors defend the title without Kawhi Leonard?\n\nEveryone in Canada is being realistic about their title chances this season. While a play-off berth is expected - a repeat of last term's heroics are not. Leonard inspired the Raptors to their maiden NBA title and if it wasn't for him they wouldn't have made it past Philadelphia in the Eastern Conference semi-finals to begin with.\n\nPre-Leonard, the Raptors had a reputation for being 'nearly-men' and were deemed not good enough to rid that tag with Kyle Lowry as their leader. The point guard will be out to prove his critics wrong but without Leonard alongside him it's unfathomable.\n\nExpect continued improvement from Pascal Siakam and Fred VanVleet though. Oh and Drake to get into it with an opposing basketball player on the sidelines.\n\nThe Totonto Raptors may be without Leonard but they still have Kyle Lowry running the point\n\n7. And of their first opponents the New Orleans Pelicans... will Zion Williamson live up to the hype?\n\nJJ REDICK'S RUN TO THE POST-SEASON JJ Redick won a state championship in his senior year of high school. He went to the NCAA Tournament in all four of his college seasons at Duke. And in 13 NBA seasons, he's been to the play-offs 13 times. Post-season basketball is an annual rite for Redick, a streak he's putting on the line this season with the New Orleans Pelicans. And Redick mentioned the streak to rookie Zion Williamson in their first real conversation about this season. 'The last thing I said to him was, `Look man, don't (mess) this up for me,'' Redick said. 'He got it.'\n\nThe defending champions versus the No 1 draft pick from this year's class had the hallmarks for a blockbuster affair. However, we've all been robbed of that with news of Zion Williamson's injury. The 19-year-old will miss between six-eight weeks of the NBA season after undergoing surgery on Monday due to a torn lateral meniscus in his right knee.\n\nThe 6ft 6in, 20st 4lbs power forward had impressed in pre-season - averaging 23.2 points across his four matches. The former Duke star had already demonstrated his ball-handling skills and spectacular dunks with some spectacular highlight plays over that sequence.\n\nHe is a generational talent but his injury record is a concern. If he can stay fit then he will certainly live up to the hype with the likes of Jrue Holiday, Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram and Redick in support.\n\nZion Williamson will miss the first six-eight weeks of the season after undergoing knee surgery\n\n8. Can Giannis Antetokounmpo win the MVP award again?\n\nHas there ever been a MVP with such an upside as Giannis Antetokounmpo in history? Last season the 24-year-old averaged 27.7 points and 12.5 rebounds as he led the Milwaukee Bucks to the best record in the regular season as they reached the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nThe scary thing for the other 29 franchises? This was all without a reliable jump shot. The 'Greek Freak' was an unstoppable force driving to the basket and if he can stretch his shooting range then he really won't have any weak links.\n\nThe Bucks and 76ers are going to battle it out for the top seed in the East, so if he improves his shooting and the Bucks clinch first then he could be another back-to-back MVP.\n\nMilwaukee Bucks' talisman Giannis Antetokounmpo is unstoppable when he flies to the basket\n\n9. Speaking of MVPs, how will James Harden and Russell Westbrook co-exist at the Houston Rockets?\n\nTRIPLE-DOUBLE ALERT Houston's Russell Westbrook is one triple-double away from passing Magic Johnson on the NBA's all-time regular season list. Westbrook has 138 triple-doubles, matching Johnson's total. Westbrook enters this year 43 away from the record of 181, held by Oscar Robertson. Westbrook had eight triple-doubles in his first six seasons. He's had 130 in the five seasons since.\n\nTwo MVPs, 15 All-Star appearances and four scoring titles combined. Is there a better backcourt duo on paper than James Harden and Russell Westbrook?\n\nOf course this is a wide-open debate but essentially on paper you have one player (Westbrook) who is an excellent passer and another (Harden) who is a scoring machine.\n\nYet, while their skillsets should compliment one another, you have to remember one thing... there is only one basketball. And that's where the problem could arise. The pair both like to dominate the ball so it will be interesting who brings it up court. In theory that should be Westbrook as Harden is the much better shooter, but the latter has done that for several years in Houston now.\n\nHead coach Mike D'Antoni preaches the three-point game - an area that Westbrook doesn't thrive in. He has a career average of 30.8 per cent behind the arc during his 11 previous seasons in the NBA - all with the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nOne hope for the Rockets though is Westbrook and Harden's relationship. It's a true friendship that grew during their early years together at Oklahoma. They insist they will share the ball around which is a must for them to thrive.\n\nRussell Westbrook (left) and James Harden will look to silence their Houston Rockets doubters\n\n10. And finally, can the Boston Celtics recapture the chemistry of two years ago after key roster changes?\n\nLast season was a bitterly disappointing one for the Boston Celtics. After excelling in the absence of injured duo Gordon Hayward and Irving during the 2017-18 term, they did anything but with both fit last season.\n\nChemistry issues were apparent throughout the campaign with the likes of Irving and Terry Rozier vocal about certain issues during and post their run up to their Eastern Conference semi-finals. Both have gone now and head coach Brad Stevens will be hoping he has a happier team ethos.\n\nKemba Walker is a ready-made replacement for Irving and will no doubt have countless comparisons to him this season. Horford's move to rivals Philadelphia is a blow but they will be targeting a top three seed along with the likes of the Indiana Pacers.\n\nKemba Walker (left) is the Boston Celtics main acquisition during an off-season of change\n\nThe 2019-20 NBA regular season will feature a record 48 primetime games in Europe, Middle East and Africa as part of the league's NBA Saturdays and NBA Sundays primetime initiative.", "description": "Basketball season returns on Tuesday night in what is bound to be the most exciting NBA season in recent memory.
