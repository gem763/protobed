So with so many important new real-life models flying around at this year\u2019s Frankfurt motor show, it should come as no surprise that concept cars are fewer and further between.\n\nNevertheless, some manufacturers have rolled out visions of the future that are worth talking about. Some are pure flights of fancy, while others predict the look and feel \u2013 and importantly, the technology \u2013 of future models. Here\u2019s our run-down of the best.\n\nHyundai 45\n\nInspiration comes from all sorts of places \u2013 and in Hyundai\u2019s case, it\u2019s come from the past. This pure-electric 45 concept previews the design language Hyundai will use on its future models, and was inspired by the Hyundai Pony Coupe Concept of 1974, with which it shares its scowling nose and fastback tail.", "description": "Concept cars at motor shows usually emerge when manufacturers don\u2019t have an awful lot of new production cars to shout about.", "authors": ["Alex Robbins", "Dr Ken German"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cars/images/2019/09/11/TELEMMGLPICT000209069643-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
