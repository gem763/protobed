Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) is vowing to hit Turkey with \u201csanctions from hell\u201d if it carries out its plan to invade northern Syria.\n\nDelivering his warning in a tweet Tuesday, Graham said congressional action would be \u201cwide, deep, and devastating.\u201d The threat comes just two days after the Trump administration announced it would step aside as Turkey gears up to move into the region, leaving American-allied Kurdish fighters to fend for themselves.\n\nIf Turkey moves into northern Syria, sanctions from hell \u2013 by Congress \u2013 will follow.\n\n\n\nWide, deep, and devastating sanctions. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 8, 2019\n\nGraham has spoken out vociferously against President Donald Trump\u2019s decision, which was announced Sunday, slamming it as a betrayal of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, an alliance of local militias battling the self-declared Islamic State. The senator is one of several prominent Republicans \u2015 in addition to foreign policy experts \u2015 who say that if U.S. troops pull out of northern Syria, Turkey would unleash attacks on Kurdish forces, whom it regards as terrorists.\n\nThe United States partnered with Kurdish forces and other local militias in 2015 to fight ISIS in northeastern Syria. Since then, around 1,000 U.S. troops have been stationed in the area backing the SDF.\n\nOn Monday, Graham urged Trump during a \u201cFox & Friends\u201d interview and on social media to reconsider his decision, calling it \u201ca disaster in the making\u201d and \u201ca stain on America\u2019s honor.\u201d\n\nHe also noted that he hopes the potential sanctions against Turkey \u201cwould be veto-proof.\u201d\n\nTrump has not backed down from his decision, but tweeted on Monday that he would \u201ctotally destroy and obliterate\u201d Turkey\u2019s economy if it \u201cdoes anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off-limits.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump defended the policy shift, tweeting, \u201cin no way have we Abandoned the Kurds, who are special people and wonderful fighters,\u201d and praising U.S.-Turkey relations.\n\nContinuing, he asserted that \u201cany unforced or unnecessary fighting by Turkey will be devastating to their economy and to their very fragile currency.\u201d\n\nHowever, the same day, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said the country would not bow to pressure from the U.S.\n\n\u201cWhere Turkey\u2019s security is concerned, we determine our own path, but we set our own limits,\u201d he said, according to The Associated Press.", "description": "The Republican senator warned the action would be \"devastating\" for Turkey.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9cc6e8210000420733ce7c.jpeg?cache=n6bz9sj1xx&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
