She collides with Witherspoon\u2019s character, a brash, younger field reporter who may be gunning for her job or could become her best friend, we aren\u2019t yet sure.\n\nApple bought the show in a bidding war and ordered up two seasons. If the people who brought you the iPod were going to compete with Netflix and Hulu, Aniston and Witherspoon \u2014 who also serve as executive producers \u2014 seemed like a pretty good bet. \u201cI just felt like this was exactly what we were looking for,\u201d said Eddy Cue, a senior vice president at Apple overseeing the new service, who declined to name the price the company paid for the show but acknowledged that the draw of luring Aniston back to TV added to the appeal.\n\nBut then Weinstein happened. Charlie Rose was canceled. Matt Lauer was fired from \u201cToday. \u201d \u201cAnd we basically just started over,\u201d said Witherspoon. \u201cWe had to.\u201d\n\nKerry Ehrin, a creator of the A&E series \u201cBates Motel,\u201d was brought in to write a new script, replacing the original showrunner. The updated premise: Alex\u2019s longtime co-host is fired after news of his behavior on the job (and in his dressing room) becomes public, throwing the show and her career into chaos.\n\nCarell would be cast to play the disgraced anchor \u2014 whom Aniston described as a kind of lovable, cocky narcissist who, like so many powerful men before him, \u201cjust thinks everybody wants to sleep with him.\u201d Witherspoon\u2019s character would be positioned as a potential replacement to fill his now open anchor chair. \u201c The Morning Show\u201d would still tackle gender and ageism, but also tell a more complicated story of what happens when an idol falls. W hat does it mean for his unknowing co-workers and friends, like Alex? His ability to seek redemption? And, without knowing exactly of what he\u2019s accused, whose side should we be on?", "description": "Fifteen years after \u201cFriends,\u201d she is returning to TV in Apple\u2019s \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d as a news anchor dealing with ageism, sexism and her co-host\u2019s misconduct.", "authors": ["Jessica Bennett"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/15/arts/15new-aniston-1/15new-aniston-1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
