Have a safe journey home and take care.\n\n\u2018Also been told what the Bulgaria captain did at half-time. To stand alone and do the right thing takes courage and acts like that shouldn\u2019t go unnoticed. #NoToRacism\u2019\n\nNot an easy situation to play in and not one which should be happening in 2019.
