Options range from a turbulent \u2018no-deal\u2019 exit to abandoning the whole endeavor.\n\nAfter wresting control of the lower house of parliament on Wednesday, an alliance of opposition parties and rebels expelled from Johnson\u2019s Conservative party voted to force him to seek a three-month delay to Brexit rather than leaving without a deal on Oct. 31, the date now set in law.\n\nBehind the sound and the fury of the Brexit crisis, an election now beckons for a polarized country.\n\nThe main choices on offer are Johnson\u2019s radical insistence on leaving the EU on Oct. 31, come what may, and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s hard-left socialist vision, coupled with a promise of a fresh referendum with an option to stay in the EU.\n\n\u201cBoris will argue that it is now time for the people to decide after parliament has failed them, so we can resolve this once and for all,\u201d a spokesman for the prime minister said.\n\n\u201cJeremy Corbyn continues not only to block Brexit but is now also stopping the people having their say by refusing a general election.\u201d\n\nThe opposition Labour Party cast Johnson\u2019s language - including calling Corbyn a \u201cchicken\u201d - as pathetic, said he was trying to act like U.S. President Donald Trump, and compared him to a 3-year-old toddler having a tantrum.\n\nAn election adds a new twist to a Brexit crisis that has for three years overshadowed European Union affairs, eroded Britain\u2019s reputation as a stable pillar of the West and seen sterling twitch in tune to the probability of a \u2018no-deal\u2019 exit.\n\nAsked if Brexit would happen on Oct. 31, Johnson\u2019s senior adviser Dominic Cummings told Reuters: \u201cTrust the people.\u201d\n\nAgainst the dollar, the pound fell 0.3% to $1.2211, after jumping 1.4% on Wednesday on the sense that the prospect of a \u2018no-deal\u2019 exit had receded. UBS Global Wealth Management said sterling could rally to $1.30 if Brexit was delayed until January 2020 and an election was held after October. [GBP/]\n\n\u201cTRUST THE PEOPLE\u201d\n\nJohnson, the face of the 2016 Vote Leave campaign, has pushed for an election on Oct. 15, two weeks before the United Kingdom is due to leave the EU, though opposition parties are debating which date they would accept.\n\n\u201cWe are saying, yeah, bring on an general election, of course,\u201d said John McDonnell, the Labour Party\u2019s second most powerful man.\n\n\u201cWe will ensure that happens after we have got the legislation to protect against a \u2018no-deal\u2019 Brexit. But we will consult and do it on at the date on which we will think will have maximum advantage against a \u2018no-deal\u2019,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile sterling rose on parliament\u2019s bid to block a no-deal exit, an election before Brexit would allow him, if he won, to repeal the blocking bill, which was passed by 329-300 and then 327-299 in the House of Commons on Wednesday. The law will pass the upper house, the Lords, by Friday evening.\n\nJohnson\u2019s finance minister, Sajid Javid, opened up the possibility of a change to the Oct. 15 date but said the government could strike a renegotiated Brexit deal with Brussels and get it through parliament before Oct. 31.\n\nBut the EU, and Germany and France in particular, have repeatedly called on Britain to make specific proposals on how it wants to change the agreement struck by Johnson\u2019s predecessor, Theresa May, in November.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nDiplomats said an election campaign would halt any Brexit talks with the EU and expressed frustration with the turmoil of British politics at such an important juncture in European history.\n\n\u201cThe UK side continues to produce chaos and it is very hard to predict anything,\u201d said one EU diplomat.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was on Thursday kicking off what is in effect an election campaign, casting an alliance of opposition parties trying to block a 'no-deal' Brexit as defeatists surrendering to the European Union.", "authors": ["Guy Faulconbridge", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190905&t=2&i=1426483461&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF840T7", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
