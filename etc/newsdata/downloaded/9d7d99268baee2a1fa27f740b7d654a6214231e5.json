The responses from the president, meanwhile, are narrowing -- and pushing his allies in uncomfortable directions.\n\nThose offering potentially damaging information and testimony now come from inside and outside of Trump\u2019s own party, his own administration and even his own White House.\n\nDoug Mills/Pool via Reuters, FILE\n\nTrump has now labeled as a \u201cNever Trumper\u201d -- without evidence -- a member of his own National Security Council and decorated service member who voiced his concerns after actually listening to the infamous phone call and who testified Tuesday before House impeachment investigators. Over on cable stations, some Trump allies have suggested much worse about the motives of Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman \u2013 again, without evidence.\n\nWhat\u2019s notable is how few rank-and-file Republicans are willing to follow that. It wasn\u2019t just Sen. Mitt Romney saying it\u2019s \u201cabsurd\u201d to call Vindman\u2019s loyalties into question; Rep. Liz Cheney called it \u201cshameful,\u201d and Sen. John Thune called him a \u201cpatriot.\u201d\n\nWith more witnesses coming to Capitol Hill on Wednesday, and the House set to approve procedures for public hearings on Thursday, attention will turn to witnesses both known and still unknown whose motivations will be difficult to undermine.\n\nThe president wants everyone to choose sides. That\u2019s an increasingly unappealing choice to the very allies he needs most at this moment.\n\nThe RUNDOWN with MaryAlice Parks\n\nThe House of Representatives will vote Thursday on a resolution formalizing the process and mechanics around the presidential impeachment investigation going forward. The move has the potential to seriously undercut one of Republicans' go-to talking points lately: that they have been unfairly sidelined.\n\nABC News\n\nAs written and made public Tuesday afternoon, the resolution directs \"certain committees to continue their ongoing investigations as part of the existing House of Representatives inquiry into whether sufficient grounds exist for the House of Representatives to exercise its Constitutional power to impeach Donald John Trump, President of the United States of America, and for other purposes.\"\n\nSpecifically, the resolution affords minority party leaders (aka top Republicans in relevant committees) considerable power and rights presenting evidence along the way.\n\nThe resolution, for example, allows for the ranking Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee and Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence to request witness testimony as a part of the process and, in agreement of the chair, use subpoena power, too, in order to further compel testimony or documents from possible witnesses. In the event one of the Democratic committee leaders disagrees with an appeal from their ranking Republican companion, that GOP member can then refer the ask to the entire committee for a decision.\n\nIf this resolution passes, it will likely put renewed pressure on Republicans to defend the president\u2019s actions themselves and engage in the process in a substantive way.\n\nThe TIP with Chris Donato\n\nWednesday marks the beginning of the period for candidates to fill out the necessary paperwork to get on New Hampshire\u2019s primary ballot.\n\nPete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana, will be the first major candidate to file for the ballot. He\u2019s scheduled to enter the secretary of state\u2019s office, fill out his form, and handover $1,000 at noon.\n\nBastiaan Slabbers/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nThe candidates often take such moments to show off their support, lining the hallways of the state house -- and the room where they\u2019ll file -- with cheering supporters. Some, like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders who will hold a rally outside the New Hampshire State House after he finishes filing, take the party outside.\n\nCandidates often show up and fill out the paperwork themselves, but they can send a representative. Vice President Mike Pence will file on President Trump\u2019s behalf, according to the vice president's office.\n\nThe campaigns have been increasing their staff in the Granite State ahead of the nation's first primary in February. The Buttigieg campaign has one of the largest staffs on the ground with roughly 60 staffers while Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard is at the other end of the spectrum with a much smaller contingent.\n\nThe filing period runs on weekdays until Nov. 15, except for Veterans Day.\n\nTHE PLAYLIST\n\nABC News\u2019 \u201cPowerhouse Politics\u201d Podcast.
