The addition comes almost a year after a planned Robinhood checking account product was torpedoed by regulatory and insurance questions.\n\nGallagher will be Robinhood\u2019s first independent board member, the startup plans to announce Monday. He was SEC commissioner from 2011 to 2015, and is currently the deputy chair of the securities department at law firm WilmerHale. Gallagher also previously held other positions at the SEC, including during the financial crisis, where he played a role in the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy.\n\nIn a statement, Robinhood Co-Chief Executive Officer Baiju Bhatt said the startup is focused on working \u201cto make our financial system more inclusive. To support this, we continue to add leaders that have deep regulatory and financial backgrounds.\u201d\n\nGallagher\u2019s appointment comes at a critical time for Robinhood, which was most recently valued at $7.6 billion. Like many fintechs, the startup is aiming to launch more bank-like services, edging into a tightly regulated industry.
