It soon became clear to us that the real reason for inviting us down was to try and get Charlotte and Mrs Sacoolas in a room together,\u201d Mr Seiger told BBC\u2019s Breakfast.\n\nHe added: \u201cIt was quite an extraordinary meeting. After the pleasantries and greetings, and of course quite sincere and warm condolences, he got down to business and said he had Mrs Sacoolas in the next room.\n\n\u201cI nearly had a heart attack, because I thought he was just going to bring her in. That\u2019s when I quite forcefully said no, that\u2019s not happening Mr President, these good people are not ready.\u201d\n\nMr Seiger said the White House had invited at least three photographers to the meeting and appeared \u201cready to do a press call\u201d.\n\nSpeaking to reporters following the 15-minute meeting with the president, Ms Charles said she was \u201cshocked\u201d when \u201cthe bombshell was dropped\u201d that Ms Sacoolas was in the White House.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Mr Dunn said the couple also \u201cweren\u2019t ready to meet her\u201d and \u201cit would have been too rushed\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not what we wanted \u2013 we wanted a meeting with her in the UK,\u201d he added.\n\nBut US national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien, who was present for the talks with Mr Trump, told the couple \u201cquite emphatically\u201d that Ms Sacoolas \u201cis never coming back\u201d to Britain, said Mr Seigar.\n\nThe lawyer added: \u201cI think the family feel a little ambushed to say the least and disappointed they made the effort to go all the way down there and all the way back up with really no further progress towards achieving the closure they\u2019re so desperately seeking.\u201d\n\nAsked if she felt the meeting was trying to sweep Harry\u2019s death under the carpet, Ms Charles said: \u201cInitially yes, I did think they were trying to do that \u2013 certainly by having Mrs Sacoolas there.\n\n\u201cI think maybe they were thinking that would be enough for us. We\u2019re seven weeks on and it\u2019s just not enough.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cWe didn\u2019t get the answers that we wanted. They couldn\u2019t tell us who made the decision to bring her back to the US.\u201d\n\nMs Sacoolas left the UK days after the 27 August crash which killed Dunn near RAF Croughton. She later confirmed she had been driving on the wrong side of the road when her 4x4 smashed into the teenager\u2019s bike and said she was \u201cterribly sorry\u201d.\n\nMr Dunn said her statement had made the situation \u201ca little bit worse\u201d.\n\n\u201cNow she\u2019s admitted it, we don\u2019t understand why she\u2019s not coming back,\u201d he told the BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today. \u201cShe\u2019s admitted her guilt but we still can\u2019t get any further forward with getting her back for some justice for Harry.\u201d\n\nNorthamptonshire Police was wrongly advised by the UK Foreign Office that Ms Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity, allowing her to return to the US without being interviewed.\n\nMr Seiger said Dunn\u2019s family were considering legal action to establish \u201cwhether somebody cocked up or whether they were put under pressure by the Americans\u201d.\n\nThe teenager\u2019s mother told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain on Wednesday she did not hold much hope that Ms Sacoolas would voluntarily return to the UK.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re just going to just be forever disappointed, forever disgusted in both the UK and US governments. It just doesn\u2019t make sense to us as to why on earth this should be allowed to happen,\u201d she said.", "description": "Donald Trump \u201cambushed\u201d Harry Dunn\u2019s parents by revealing the woman allegedly responsible for the teenager\u2019s death was waiting to meet them in a nearby room\u00a0at the White House, their lawyer has said.
