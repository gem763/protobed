He has previously ruled out forming a coalition with Andrew Scheer's Conservatives.\n\nIn the past, NDP leaders have said they were open to working with other parties to thwart a Conservative government, but it is unusual to hear this said during the campaign.\n\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh says he will do whatever it takes to fight the Conservatives if the Tories win the most seats but fall short of a majority. 1:00\n\nWhile campaigning over the Thanksgiving weekend, Singh has been asking voters to elect as many NDP candidates to Parliament as possible in an effort to push forward a progressive policies, such as universal pharmacare, dental care and environmental protections.\n\nReject 'false choice'\n\nHe also urged voters to reject the \"false choice\" Trudeau and Liberals are presenting of a vote for Trudeau being the only way to stop a Scheer government \u2014 and called on Canadians to throw their support behind the NDP to \"break the cycle.\"\n\n\"For me, I feel like there's this false choice being presented that if you only have to choose in an election between bad and worse, it's not really much of a choice.\"\n\nIn recent days, as polls suggest Scheer's Conservatives could take the most seats on Oct. 21 and support for the NDP increased, Trudeau pivoted his attacks leftward to a resurgent Singh.\n\nEarlier Sunday, Trudeau again made his case for progressive voters to support him over the NDP, insisting \"people need a progressive government, and not a progressive opposition.\"\n\n\"I think we've seen what happens in places like Ontario,\" Trudeau told reporters during an appearance at a Toronto Food Bank alongside Toronto Raptors president Masai Ujiri.\n\n\"We will continue to be honest with Canadians about the choice they're facing between Conservative cuts that would be four times greater than what Doug Ford has put forward, or continuing to move forward and invest in Canadians with a progressive government that is focused on them.\"\n\nNDP priorities\n\nEarlier this week, Singh laid down six \"urgent priorities\" his party would want to see met in exchange for supporting another party in a minority Parliament scenario:", "description": "NDP\u00a0Leader Jagmeet Singh says he would try to form a coalition government with other parties if the Conservatives win the most seats in the election, but fail to secure a majority.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5320030.1570992178!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/fedelxn-ndp-20191013.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
