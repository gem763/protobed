Fair enough pre record the performances but then invite them all back for a live show so we can vote.\"\n\nA third added: \"While I\u2019ve really, truly loved this series - take it as a viewer suggestion that if you do another Champions series it should be completely live.\"\n\nThis was echoed by another viewer who said: \"It's a shame this isn't live and the result got leaked because the Dog act is the best act I've ever seen on a Britain's Got Talent show.\"\n\n(Image: Tom Dymond/ITV)\n\nMeanwhile a fourth added: \"So we don\u2019t even get a live final or to vote on at least the winner of the whole thing?! Can hardly call them champions if only like 100 people get to vote.\"\n\nThe show is returning in America, with filming currently underway and the announcement of a new judge.\n\nAlesha Dixon will be swapping the BGT panel for the AGT panel for the special series.\n\nBritain's Got Talent returns in 2020 on ITV.", "description": "Britain's Got Talent: The Champions came to an end on Saturday night, and fans want a change if it returns", "authors": ["Charlotte Tutton", "Image", "Itv", "Tom Dymond", "Tom Dymond Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20470878.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SycoThamesITV.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
