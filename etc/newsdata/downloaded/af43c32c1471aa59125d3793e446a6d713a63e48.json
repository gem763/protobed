The app can also facilitate payments at brick-and-mortar stores that accept Apple Pay or Google Pay.\n\nCreating a shopping destination centered around Affirm's offerings could appeal to both consumers and merchants because it provides greater exposure. For consumers, Affirm's app makes it easier to find locations where they can shop using the POS financing offered by Affirm.\n\nConsidering that half of US consumers want to use installment loans for purchases under $250, the app should attract a wide base of consumers for Affirm. Meanwhile, merchants can benefit from adding another way to reach consumers, and having a presence on Affirm's app can make sure shoppers know they offer POS financing and boost their sales.\n\nAffirm is trying to encourage consumers to start their shopping journeys with its app \u2014 that could boost volume, but only if it succesfully competes against existing online marketplaces, like Amazon:\n\nThe app gives Affirm the chance to build consumer loyalty to its offerings and secure greater volume as a result. For those consumers who feel strongly about POS financing, and specifically Affirm's offerings, it makes sense to begin a shopping journey in Affirm's app. And if consumers start shopping on the app, it should boost the odds they end up making a purchase through Affirm, increasing its volume. This could also help it stand out from the crowded field of POS financing providers because consumers would be turning to it specifically when they start shopping, whereas most others don't interact with customers until later in the purchase process.\n\nBut Amazon dominates the product search process in the US, so Affirm will need to win consumers away from it to become a serious player in product discovery. A whopping 74% of US consumers report starting their product searches on Amazon when they need a specific product and 66% do so when they're looking for new products, per a report from Feedvisor. So Affirm will have to change consumer habits if it wants shoppers to open its app first. To do so it may want to highlight the greater accessibility of its products relative to Amazon's financing offerings, and it may need to offer promotions to get consumers to give it a try, as pulling shoppers away from Amazon is no easy feat.\n\nWant to read more stories like this one?
