His leg looked mangled, even after three years of healing. \"I was shot 14 times and left for dead,\" he said.\n\nRichardson was just 16 years old when another young man he thought was his friend riddled him with bullets. But Sally Hazelgrove was one of the first faces he saw when he woke up from a coma in the hospital.\n\nThat\u2019s one of the reasons why Richardson, now 19, is fiercely defending the woman known as \"Miss Sally,\" who is embroiled in controversy after a viral video showed her cutting off his dreadlocks two years ago.\n\n'They don't know Sally': Black teen defends white woman who cut his dreadlocks in viral video (ABC News) More\n\nThe social media onslaught began when Hazelgrove\u2019s organization, Crushers Club, which helps at-risk youth in Chicago through boxing and mentoring, received a $200,000 donation from Inspire Change, a social justice collaboration between Roc Nation, the company founded by Jay-Z, and the NFL. A mostly unknown Twitter account with the handle @RzstProgramming dug up a 2016 tweet from the Crushers Club account that shows Hazelgrove, who is white, cutting off the dreadlocks of two black male teenagers -- Richardson and another unidentified teen.\n\nThe tweet, which Hazelgrove wrote, was captioned, \"And another Crusher let me cut his dreads off! It\u2019s symbolic of change and their desire for a better life!\"\n\nToday, the NFL\u2019s #InspireChange \u201csocial justice\u201d group is funding & visiting a non-profit that wants to cut off the locks of Chicago Black youth for \u201ca better life.\u201d https://t.co/JdvWliIEqv pic.twitter.com/GpPV0DqK2M \u2014 Resist Programming \ud83d\udef0 (@RzstProgramming) September 5, 2019\n\nThe filmmaker Ava DuVernay, who is behind \"A Wrinkle in Time\" and the Netflix miniseries \"When They See Us\" about the Central Park Five, retweeted the original video last weekend, helping to set off a firestorm and charges of racism against Hazelgrove.\n\nI\u2019d like to have a conversation with you and those young people about dreads and desires and dreams. About dreads and \u201ca better life.\u201d Shame on anyone supporting this full-on nonsense. https://t.co/NgHmoOKf0r \u2014 Ava DuVernay (@ava) September 6, 2019\n\nDuVernay, who is black and wears dreadlocks herself, also started a hashtag #loclife and encouraged people to share pictures celebrating the style. For many in the black community, dreadlocks symbolize an embracing of natural hair and are a symbol of pride -- deeply personal and political.\n\nControversy erupted late last year after a New Jersey wrestler was forced to cut his dreadlocks or forfeit a match. And a 2017 study found that black women with natural hair are often placed at a disadvantage in the workplace.\n\n(MORE: High school wrestler who was forced to cut his dreadlocks displayed 'character,' his parents say)\n\nDuVernay's #loclife post received over 50,000 likes, many from the association of social media accounts known as \u2018Black Twitter\u2019 \u2013 accounts run mostly by people of color who often use the platform to sometimes express outrage over social injustice as well as discuss culture, politics and topics.\n\nThe backlash to the video was so intense that Hazelgrove was forced to make an apology via the Crushers Club Twitter account.\n\n\"The Crusher\u2019s Club does not have any policies prohibiting dreadlocks \u2013 we welcome all hairstyles from our youth. On two occasions, our kids looked to change their hairstyles and asked us to assist. I understand how my social media posts could be interpreted as insensitive, but that was never my intention,\" she wrote. She declined to comment further when reached by ABC News.\n\nRichardson said it was a huge misunderstanding and was so irked he made a video defending Hazelgrove and Crushers Club, which was posted by media outlet TMZ.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Kobe Richardson rolled up his pant leg to show where the bullets had torn through his flesh.
