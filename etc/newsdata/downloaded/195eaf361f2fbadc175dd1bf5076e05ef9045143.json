Her professor had promised higher marks for creativity when writing the assignment in exchange\n\nMaking the ink meant that Ms. Haga needed to soak soybeans overnight and then crush them, according to the BBC.\n\nNext came mixing the soybean extract with water, needing another two hours to reach the right concentration - before writing her essay with a fine brush on 'washi' (thin Japanese paper).\n\nMs Haga learned the technique as a chills, when she also became interested in ninjas after watching an animated TV show about them.\n\nThe words became invisible when the ink dried, but Ms. Haga also left a note in normal ink that instructed her professor to 'heat the paper' - to ensure he didn't put the essay in the bin.\n\nProfessor Yuji Yamada, a leading researcher of ninja history, said that the words appeared when her professor heated the paper over his gas stove.\n\nYamada also did not hesitate to give Ms. Haga full marks for the report.\n\nAs for the essay itself, Ms Haga said it had more style than substance. But she is now thinking of other ways to write essays, using ninja techniques.\n\nMie University set up the International Ninja Research Center in 2017 to learn about the secrets of feudal Japan\u2019s secret agents and mercenaries.\n\nThe assignment in its original form, plus handwritten instructions in regular ink on how to read it.\n\nThe university then offered a course to study ninja and their skills in 2018, Japanese daily Asahi Shimbun stated.\n\nThe institute of higher learning is in Iga in Mie Prefecture and Koka in Shiga Prefecture - each of which are famous for their ninja clans.\n\nThe university then started to offer a course to study ninja and their skills in 2018, Japanese daily Asahi Shimbun stated.", "description": "Eimi Haga has received top marks from her professor for completing a writing assignment ... in invisible ink.", "authors": ["Mailonline Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/10/19531558-0-image-a-2_1570699240098.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
