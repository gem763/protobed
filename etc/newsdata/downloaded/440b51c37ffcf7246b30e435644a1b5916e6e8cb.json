Eden Hazard and Thibaut Courtois are helping with the wooing, and believe it is Kant\u00e9 and not Paul Pogba who can solve Real\u2019s ills.\n\n\n\nTalking of lacklustre midfields, Manchester United would like to inject James Maddison into their team, having been undeterred by Jeremy Clarkson\u2019s criticism of the Leicester schemer\u2019s overly fastidious hair care.\n\nPremier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend Read more\n\nMeanwhile at United, David de Gea\u2019s future continues to be fluid with Edwin van der Sar, predecessor and the purported future director of football at Old Trafford, saying: \u201cOther goalkeepers can also fill the gap.\u201d De Gea\u2019s new contract, with his current one set to expire next summer, remains unsigned. One expected to be signed imminently however is that of Victor Lindel\u00f6f.\n\n\n\nIf United want to sign Jadon Sancho, a trail that went dead in the summer, then they might be encouraged by Borussia Dortmund\u2019s move to sign Bayer Leverkusen\u2019s Kai Havertz.\n\n\n\nAfter all that United news, and that dodgy midfield, it comes as something of a shock that they are not being linked with Napoli\u2019s Fabi\u00e1n Ruiz, the 23-year-old being compared to Spanish compatriot Xavi. Liverpool, Barcelona, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich are all interested in a player who will face Liverpool next week in the Champions League.\n\n\n\nNot content with Ruiz and Kant\u00e9, Real Madrid will also be signing PSG\u2019s Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 in the next couple of years, hopefully landing him next summer. The seduction and chicanery has already been set in motion by Florentino P\u00e9rez and his operatives. Meanwhile the Real president has even grander horizons in sight \u2013 he wants his club\u2019s basketball team to be playing in the NBA\u2019s Eastern Conference.\n\n\n\nNeymar corner: Barcelona will do everything in their power to get him back from PSG, according to club director Javier Bordas. Lionel Messi has also joined the charm offensive. In an interview with Sport, he said: \u201cThinking about it on a sporting level, I personally think Neymar is one of the best players in the world and having him in our squad would increase our chances of achieving our objectives.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne player who will not be leaving the French club is Marco Verratti, closing on a new contract and inheriting the captain\u2019s armband from Thiago Silva, who is preparing to leave at the end of this season.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nAnother player absolutely, positively staying put is Christian Eriksen at Tottenham, whose manager Mauricio Pochettino has dismissed the summer of speculation that this page may or may not have been a small part of. Poch said: \u201cHe never said he was not happy here \u2013 he always was.\u201d\n\nTalk in Italy of a January move to Juventus, the Dane\u2019s reportedly favoured destination, may not also necessarily mean that Eriksen is not happy with Spurs. It\u2019s not them, it\u2019s him?", "description": "Fabi\u00e1n Ruiz eyed by Liverpool? | Lionel Messi wants Neymar back | Kai Havertz for Borussia Dortmund?", "authors": ["John Brewin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7c9831fa62ff6081791cca8b4a417391f229f13/0_0_2178_1307/master/2178.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a8aaf49498b43535d7bd11c8590b5306", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
