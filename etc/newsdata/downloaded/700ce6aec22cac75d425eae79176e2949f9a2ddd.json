The moratorium will not impact pyrotechnics used off the field (i.e. along the roof of U.S. Bank Stadium).\u2019\u2019\n\nThe fire in Nashville took place after the Titans celebrated the jersey retirements of Eddie George and Steve McNair. It left a charred mark on the sideline.\n\n\u201cThe vendor will be required by the state of Tennessee to undergo an inspection for the defective device and the others that were used to determine the final cause,\u201d the team said in a statement Sunday.\n\nThe league did not say when the review would be completed.\n\nThe Washington Redskins are among the teams that use pregame pyrotechnics during player introductions. The ban will likely take place at least through Monday night\u2019s contest against the Chicago Bears at FedEx Field.\n\nMore NFL:\n\nCam Newton is out Sunday.
