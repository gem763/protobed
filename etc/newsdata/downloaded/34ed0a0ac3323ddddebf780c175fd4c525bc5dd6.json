That is fact is of public interest, but it\u2019s not even of tertiary importance relative to the president\u2019s abuse of power. It is relevant that W. Mark Felt, also known as Deep Throat, was angry at President Richard Nixon for installing a crony at the head of the FBI, but it is more important that Nixon was guilty. It is relevant that the reporter who exposed the blackface photo in Ralph Northam\u2019s yearbook is a conservative, but it is more important that the photo exists. It is relevant that Edward Snowden fled the United States after revealing that the Obama administration was breaking federal laws against warrantless surveillance, but more important than the law being broken in the first place.\n\nPut simply, whistle-blowers often have political motives, or motives that people can reasonably criticize, disagree with, or find abhorrent. But those motives do not supersede, diminish, or otherwise validate the misconduct they expose. To fixate on those motives at the expense of the misconduct being uncovered is to reward malfeasance.\n\nThe exception is where there is no actual misconduct revealed\u2014then the motives of the individual coming forward become more significant. But Trump supporters are so bereft of benign explanations for the president\u2019s behavior that they have fallen to mischaracterizing it, pretending it did not occur, or suggesting that the president was acting in jest. Similarly, Taibbi simply doesn\u2019t say what Trump did, or why it would matter in the first place.\n\nNor does the fact that the whistle-blower is a CIA official negate the complaint. One of the reasons to fear the power of intelligence and law-enforcement agencies is that they could use their considerable powers not to enforce the law or protect Americans from violence, but to manipulate the political process in their favor. Indeed, despite all the rhetoric about \u201cDeep State\u201d conspiracies, the most prominent example of such direct interference is the head of the FBI breaking protocol announcing an investigation of Hillary Clinton, while keeping the investigation into Trump secret, in order to avoid a backlash from right-wing officials within the bureau. But corrupt use of national-security authority is the very abuse of power that Trump himself was engaged in\u2014pressuring Ukraine in order to force that nation to kneecap his political opponent. If justified skepticism of intelligence agencies leads you to ignore the very kinds of abuses that make them perilous to democracy, then you\u2019ve missed the point.\n\nThe stakes here are existential. You cannot have free speech, due process, or fair elections in a country where the head of state can unilaterally demand investigations of political critics and rivals. It is not a power any president, from any party, should ever have. Whatever the whistle-blower\u2019s motives, they pale in importance compared to the misconduct that\u2019s been uncovered.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
