When hunting is banned without a viable alternative in place, this encourages land conversion towards non-wildlife based use and the indiscriminate destruction of habitats.\n\n\u201dSo you\u2019re going to see more agriculture, more pastoralism, more settlement and so you are going to have these other deaths,\u201d said Dr Dickman, who has two decades of experience in the field.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, you\u2019re likely to have much more wildlife killing, but it won\u2019t be on social media, it won\u2019t be a grinning hunter there, people won\u2019t be aware of it, but that doesn\u2019t mean it is not happening.\n\n\u201cIt is very dangerous to view this through the lens of social media because it is such a biased one, and this is why we need to listen to the conservation scientists and we need to listen to the community representatives rather than just advocacy groups.\u201d\n\nThe open letter argued the focus on trophy hunting \u201cdistracts attention from the major threats to wildlife\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe need to reduce the overall amount of wildlife killing by people, and we shouldn\u2019t fixate on one type of wildlife killing, because the huge risk is that if you focus just on reducing trophy hunting it could actually contribute to increased poisoning, spearing and snaring, Dr Dickman explained. \u201cThere are actually worse deaths in terms of welfare, and they\u2019re indiscriminate.\u201d\n\nThe conservationists referred to guidance issued in 2016 by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which said: \u201cLegal, well-regulated trophy hunting programmes can, and do, play an important role in delivering benefits for both wildlife conservation and for the livelihoods and well-being of indigenous and local communities living with wildlife.\u201d\n\nOpponents of trophy hunting bans often cite Kenya\u2018s decision to outlaw the practice in 1977.\n\nBy 2016, some estimated that wildlife populations had declined by around 68 per cent. Human activities and population increases were the leading cause of the sharp decrease, researchers concluded.\n\nBut Professor Judi Wakhungu, Kenya\u2019s former Cabinet Secretary of Environment, Water and Natural Resources, has denied the claim that the ban on trophy hunting is harming Kenya\u2019s wildlife.\n\n\u201cIn Kenya we believe a live animal is worth more over its lifetime than a one off killing,\u201d she said in March. \u201cElephant hunting was made illegal in 1973, followed by a ban on all animal hunting in 1977. Since then our elephant population has been growing steadily and our rhino breeding programme has been successful.\u201d\n\nStudies of other countries that have banned hunting for sport showed improvements to the fortunes of the species in question.\n\nIn Zambia\u2018s South Luangwa National Park, scientists studied the effect of a moratorium placed on hunting lions from 2013-2015.\n\nThey observed that more cubs were born each year during the moratorium than any year with trophy hunting, and the adult male population grew significantly. As a result, they recorded an increase of 116 lions in 2012 to 209 by the end of the moratorium.\n\n\u201cLions are one of the species most affected by trophy hunting. There were almost half a million wild lions in the 1950s. Today there are just 20,000,\u201d said Eduardo Goncalves, founder of the Campaign To Ban Trophy Hunting.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the numbers that are the issue though. Trophy hunters select the lions with the biggest manes because they make the most impressive trophies. These are also the strongest and fittest animals.\n\n\u201cStudies have shown that hunting has led to a 15 per cent fall in the genetic diversity of African lions. This means they will be less able to adapt and survive threats such as climate change. It has been estimated that hunting just 5 per cent of the remaining adult males could push lions past the point of no return.\u201d\n\nThe conservationists also argued that trophy hunting can provide incomes for marginalised and rural communities, where viable alternatives are often lacking.\n\n\u201cOpponents of hunting promote the substitution of photo-tourism,\u201d they wrote. \u201dBut many hunting areas are too remote or unappealing to attract sufficient visitors.\u201d\n\nBertrand Chardonnet, a researcher who has previously written for IUCN, questioned in March whether trophy hunting still pays its way.\n\nMr Chardonnet argued that in light of vastly diminished numbers of trophy hunters, a reduction in populations of \u201cbig game\u201d animals, and vastly reduced land space reserved for hunting, the industry was no longer generating an income comparable with tourism. This lessened the ability of trophy hunting to financially deter activities like illegal poaching and habitat destruction for agricultural purposes, he reasoned.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

In 2017, she wrote in the Washington Post. \u201cSome of the money \u2014 both from hunting and tourism \u2014 will never make it to the right people, and instead will go to elites. It\u2019s far from perfect, but at least this business \u2014 at least some of the time \u2014 keeps these animals in their habitats.\n\n\u201cThe first step is to recognise that outrage from afar never solved a local problem. We need to hear the voices of local people. Well-meaning people in the West need to stop shouting and start listening.\u201d\n\nBut Mr Gonzalez of the Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting argued it\u2019s people in the West that often fuel the industry.\n\n\u201cBritain is among the worst offenders,\u201d he said. \u201dWe are one of the worst countries in the world when it comes to hunting \u2018canned lions\u2019 that are bred and shot in captivity for \u2018sport\u2019.\n\n\u201cWe are also one of the worst when it comes to hunting elephants. British trophy hunters have imported hundreds of trophies of elephant tusks, trunks, ears, feet, tails and skins in recent years.\n\n\u201cTrophy hunting is a barbaric hang-over from the colonial era. It has no place in a civilised society. People in Britain are overwhelmingly opposed to it and want the government to stop hunters bringing their gruesome trophies into the country.\u201d\n\nDespite this, conservationists warned the international community should not undermine local communities\u2019 role in ownership, management and conservation of natural resources, as the community representatives of 12 African countries urged in June.\n\n\u201cSome people find trophy hunting repugnant (including many of us), but conservation policy that is not based on science threatens habitat and biodiversity and risks disempowering and impoverishing rural communities,\u201d the letter concluded.\n\nAdditional reporting by PA", "description": "Scores of conservationists\u00a0have written an open letter arguing that imposing trophy hunting bans without\u00a0viable alternatives will imperil biodiversity and harm local communities.
