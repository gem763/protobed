How the spike will feed through to fuel prices for consumers is less clear.\n\nAnalysts are split on the question. The problem may be that is it too early to tell.\n\nThe key issues are for how long output will be disrupted and whether there will be further attacks and another hit to production, says Marc Ostwald, chief economist at ADM Investor Services International.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Economists Bernd Weidensteiner and Marco Wagner at Commerzbank say a healthy global supply of oil means the effects of the weekend\u2019s \u201cshock\u201d to output will probably be limited.\n\nThere are already signs the initial surge in oil prices was an overreaction. Brent crude soared nearly 20 per cent in the first few moments of trading before retreating to trade 10-12 per cent higher on the day.\n\nRuss Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, does not expect a further rise.\n\n\u201cThe good news is that even after today\u2019s spike, oil is still almost a fifth lower than where it was a year ago,\u201d Mould says.\n\n\u201cSo economists, analysts, investors and car drivers can probably breathe easy for now.\u201d\n\nBut there are other, UK-specific reasons fuel prices may not rise anytime soon.\n\nSimon Williams at the RAC, a motoring organisation, predicts that wholesale prices of both petrol and diesel will increase by 3p a litre, but says this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean higher prices at the pumps because retailers only just began to pass on wholesale price savings at the end of last week.\n\n\u201cAt that point the 128p forecourt price of petrol was 7p too high, which means retailers should have a cushion to absorb the spike,\u201d he adds.\n\nBut he warns: \u201cIf the barrel price remains high for a sustained period however, it could easily lead to several pence a litre being added to the average price of both fuels.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
