Once a company signs up, its employees have access to a range of gyms in different locations, at a discounted rate. Current global clients include Uber, PayPal, and Deloitte.\n\nWhen Carvalho, the company's cofounder and CEO, started building Gympass, he was a student at Harvard Business School; he dropped out soon after to work full-time on his business.\n\nCarvalho told Business Insider that his inability to envision a bigger future for the company \u2014 which currently employs about 800 people worldwide \u2014 negatively influenced his hiring strategy. Specifically, he made the mistake of looking for people who could do the job that day, as opposed to people who would still excel in their role years into the future.\n\n\"The hiring decisions that we made in the beginning were not optimal,\" Carvalho said. \"We had to continuously bring more senior people to the company. And what I learned from it is that being able to plan for the next two to three years helps a lot on that.\"\n\nToday, he seeks candidates \"who are going to be great [working on] not what has to be done today, but two to three years from now.\"\n\nYou probably won't regret over-investing in hiring top talent\n\nCarvalho's observations about hiring mirror those of Patty McCord, the former chief talent officer at Netflix. McCord previously told Business Insider that managers should always be considering whether the team they have now will still be able to push the company forward in six months. If not, the manager may need to replace some people on their team.\n\nRead more: A manager's No. 1 job is to create 'resume-worthy' experiences for employees, says Netflix's original chief talent officer \u2014 and using the '6-month rule' is key\n\nTo be sure, a stellar candidate may not necessarily want to join your fledgling startup.\n\n\"It's actually super challenging to make the decision to hire someone for what the company needs three years from now,\" Carvalho said. \"At the point in time that you're making the decision, you might not have at the bank the cash that you need to support that person.\"\n\nThat means \"taking two leaps of faith on the future of the company,\" Carvalho said. Not only are you assuming that this person will still be a good fit in three years \u2014 you're also assuming that the business will still be successful in three years.\n\nColumbia Business School assistant professor Jorge Guzman told Business Insider that a proactive mindset at the start of a company's journey, as evidenced by actions from the founders that anticipate future growth, actually ties to measurable growth in terms of an IPO or acquisition.\n\nCarvalho wishes he'd invested more in the people running his company from the outset: \"Had we done it, we would have been at a much better stage today than we currently are.\"", "description": "One of the best pieces of entrepreneurship advice is to hire people who will be successful today \u2014 and also three years down the line.", "authors": ["Shana Lebowitz", "Sherin Shibu"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5bd31c4fcf3f6e3567661594?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
