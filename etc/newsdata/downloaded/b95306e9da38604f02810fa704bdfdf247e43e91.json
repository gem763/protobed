Interactive map predicts peak foliage dates across the US", "language": "en", "text": "Advertisement\n\nFall is upon us and parts of the US will soon experience one of nature\u2019s most stunning shows: the annual changing of leaves.\n\nFor those who look forward to seeing this season in all of its glory, a new interactive map reveals when foliage will peak in different regions of the country.\n\nThis year, the map shows peak viewing times for a majority of the US is between October 5th and 12th.\n\nTo use the map, slide the date bar underneath the graph, which will display the stage the leaves are expected to be at in each county of the U.S. on different dates.\n\nAreas highlighted in red reveal peak season, while brown suggests the peak is over and green that it hasn't yet started.\n\nTHE COLORFUL COMPOUNDS It takes a few moving parts for the foliage process to be a successful one Green: Chlorophyll gives plants their green color. It dominates for most of the year but less is produced when there is less light during the daytime. Yellow: Carotenoids and flavonoids are always present in leaves but come to the fore in autumn, turning leaves yellow. One example of a carotenoid is lutein which makes egg yolks yellow. Orange: Carotenoids contribute orange colors. Beta-carotene is one of the most common carotenoids in plants and is responsible for the orange color of carrots. Red: Anthocyanin synthesis is kick-started by the onset of autumn, producing the red and magenta hues in leaves\n\nThe leaves first began to change in the mid-west, great lakes area and areas of New England around September 14th \u2013 the first day of fall is September 23rd.\n\nThe predictive map uses a complex algorithm that computes over 37,000 pieces of information in order to accurately forecast when fall peak will occur at the county-level.\n\nIt includes calculations on historical temperatures, historical rainfall, forecast weather patterns and historical leaf color changes.\n\nTo use the map, slide the date bar underneath the graph, which will display the stage the leaves are expected to be at in each county of the U.S. on different dates. Areas highlighted in red reveal peak season, while brown suggests the peak is over and green that it hasn't yet started\n\nFor those who look forward to seeing this season in all of its glory, a new interactive map reveals when foliage will peak in different regions of the country. This year, the map shows peak viewing times for a majority of the US is between October 5th and 12th\n\nAsk most Americans what their favorite season is and many will answer with \u2018the fall\u2019.\n\nAfter three months of hot summer, most people enjoy the chill in the air and the show they get as the leaves begin to change.\n\nThe 2019 Fall Foliage Map is the ultimate visual planning guide to the annual progressive changing of the leaves,\u2019 according to smokymountains.com, creator of the map.\n\nAlthough the tool is not 100 percent accurate, it is meant to help travelers plan trips to catch a glimpse at the foliage across the US.\n\nThe leaves change as a way for the trees to protect themselves during the harsh, freezing temperatures.\n\nIf they did not lose their leaves, the vegetation would freeze during the winter months -- ultimately damaging and even killing the tree.\n\nThe foliage begins to change around September 14th in northern areas of the US and within three weeks those areas are at their peak. And by November 30th all of the country except for the southern areas of Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi and Florida have all pasted their peak stages\n\nThe tree begins by slowly closing off the veins that carry water and nutrients to and from the leaves with a layer of new cells that form at the base of the leaf stem, protecting the limbs and body of the tree.\n\nWater and nutrients will then stop flowing to the leaf, leaving it to die and fall off.\n\nBournemouth-based teacher Andy Brunning who is the author of Compound Interest, explains that the compounds \u2013 chlorophyll, carotenoids, flavonoids - are present in leaves all year round, but become more noticeable at this time of year.\n\nChlorophyll is the chemical compound responsible for the green colouration of most leaves.\n\nThe chemical is held within chloroplasts in the cells of leaves and is an essential ingredient in photosynthesis, in which plants use energy from the sun to convert carbon dioxide and water into sugars.\n\nPlants need warm temperatures and sunlight to produce chlorophyll so as fall begins and the nights draw in, chlorophyll production slows and the existing amounts of chemical compounds in the leaves decomposes.\n\nAs a result, other compounds present in the leaves are more noticeable, such as carotenoids and flavonoids, creating a change in color.\n\nThe foliage begins to change around September 14th in northern areas of the US and within three weeks those areas are at their peak.\n\nAnd by November 30th all of the country except for the southern areas of Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi and Florida have all pasted their peak stages.", "description": "For those who look forward to seeing fall in all of its glory, an interactive map reveals when foliage will peak in the US, which the maps shows will be between Oct 5th and 12th in different parts of the US.", "authors": ["Stacy Liberatore For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/17/19404716-0-image-a-3_1570466608187.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
