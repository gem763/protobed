Bernie Sanders has said publicly that he doesn\u2019t believe government should own the means of production. Yet he appears on national television last week and agrees there should be a \u201cfederal takeover\u201d of the energy sector. His Marxist slip is showing.\n\n\u201cWhen I use the world socialist \u2014 and I know some people aren\u2019t comfortable about it \u2014 I\u2019m saying that it is imperative\u201d to \u201ccreate a government that works for all and not just the few,\u201d the Vermont Democratic lawmaker said in 2015.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe,\u201d he continued, \u201cgovernment should own the means of production,\u201d which of course is a hallmark of socialism.\n\nThat version is quite different from the 1976 Sanders, who said \u201cI favor the public ownership of utilities, banks and major industries.\u201d\n\n2015 Sanders is also inconsistent with the Sanders of spring 2019, who, according to People\u2019s World, which claims to be the \u201cvoice for progressive change and socialism\u201d in America, \u201cwill propose workers take ownership of individual plants and businesses, removing them from the hands of the bosses and financiers who back them.\u201d\n\nOwnership won\u2019t change hands unless a coercive government becomes involved and socializes business. The workers can\u2019t simply vote companies over to themselves.\n\nLast week Sanders appeared on MSNBC, where he seemed to agree with the host that nationalization of electricity production is necessary.\n\nWhile discussing \u201chow power is generated and distributed,\u201d Chris Hayes told Sanders \u201cyou propose essentially a takeover of the whole thing. Essentially a Tennessee Valley Authority extension for the whole country. Am I understanding that correctly?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, yeah, you\u2019re in the ballpark, that\u2019s right,\u201d Sanders replies.\n\nShowing an even deeper affinity for the hard left, Sanders on Tuesday declared that China has made \u201cmore progress in addressing extreme poverty than any country in the history of civilization.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve done,\u201d he said, \u201ca lot of things for their people.\u201d\n\nTo his credit, Sanders did mention China\u2019s \u201cauthoritarian way.\u201d But it\u2019s not China\u2019s slow move toward a more liberal economy that prompted him to gush. It\u2019s his antipathy toward free-market capitalism, which in his fevered thinking promotes inequality. It somehow escapes this man that capitalism is the only system in history that\u2019s been able to lift billions out of what legendary economist Milton Friedman called \u201cgrinding\u201d poverty.\n\nSanders is well-known for supporting other socialist struggles, such as his crusade for Medicare for All, his fondness for Daniel Ortega\u2019s Sandinista government in Nicaragua, and his admiration for Fidel Castro\u2019s \u201cworkers\u2019 paradise.\u201d\n\nSocialism\u2019s $6 Trillion Man believes he has the right to dictate how private businesses conduct their affairs, while he argues that the \u201cexploited\u201d among us \u2014 meaning those he is pandering to for votes \u2014 have a right to a job, health care, education, \u201caffordable housing,\u201d and \u201ca secure retirement\u201d provided by the toil of others.\n\nSanders tried to run away from his red roots during the 2016 election cycle because he knew the country wouldn\u2019t vote for an outright socialist. But now it seems he\u2019s opening up, perhaps buoyed by the fact the Democratic Socialists of America, \u201cAmerica\u2019s largest socialist party,\u201d has grown, says the Hoover Institution\u2019s Paul R. Gregory, \u201cfrom 6,000 to 60,000 dues-paying members in the last eight years and counts two members of Congress \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) and Rashida Tlaib \u2014 in its ranks.\u201d\n\nMaybe by the time the Democrats debate again, Sanders will be telling everyone that his preferred pronoun is \u201ccomrade.\u201d\n\nNote to Readers: Issues & Insights is a new site launched by the seasoned journalists behind the legendary IBD Editorials page.
