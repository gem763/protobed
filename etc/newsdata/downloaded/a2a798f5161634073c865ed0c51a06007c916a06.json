Sign up here.\n\nIndia unveiled new measures involving a more than $7 billion boost to exporters and housing projects, as part of efforts to revive a flagging economy.\n\nA program to refund taxes and levies for export promotion will be effective Jan. 1 and involves forgoing 500 billion rupees ($7 billion) in revenue, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman told reporters in New Delhi on Saturday. The government will separately set up a 100 billion-rupee funding window for affordable housing to revive stalled projects, she said.\n\nExporters will benefit from tax incentives and improved credit and insurance cover, while the real estate sector will get access to last-mile funding for affordable housing projects provided they haven\u2019t been declared as non-performing asset or pushed to insolvency proceedings, she said.\n\nThe stimulus -- the first significant fiscal giveaway -- is the latest in a series of steps announced by the government to boost consumer demand and attract investments in an economy that\u2019s seen growth decelerate for five straight quarters. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been under pressure from industry groups and political opponents to use the fiscal space afforded to him last month by a more than $24 billion windfall from the Reserve Bank of India.\n\nThe government will make every effort to ensure that the revenue loss from the measures won\u2019t affect the fiscal deficit target, Sitharaman said. In July, she set a goal to narrow the budget gap to 3.3% of gross domestic product in the year ending March 2020.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m conscious of it,\u201d Sitharaman said. \u201cI will do as much as possible to stick to it.\u201d\n\nThe support to exporters is key for Asia\u2019s third-largest economy, which is seeking to triple annual overseas sales to $1 trillion in five years. Exports have dropped in two of the three months to August despite a weaker rupee. A trade war between the U.S. and China, and a weakening global economy further risk damping demand for India\u2019s pharmaceutical products, garments and steel.\n\nThe measures are welcome to the extent \u201cthe government recognizes the demand side pressures in both real estate and exports sectors,\u201d said Madhavi Arora, an economist with Edelweiss Securities Pvt. in Mumbai. \u201cHowever the steps will help only at the margin.\u201d\n\nThe problems of these sectors are deep-rooted and the steps announced Saturday only tackle some of them, Arora said.\n\nNot Enough\n\nThe measures \u201cseem to come in tranches, rather than at one go,\u201d Sitharaman said, referring to some steps unveiled earlier to boost growth. \u201cBut each time we\u2019re making a clear attempt to also to connect with the previous announcements that we have made.\u201d\n\nShe said the funding window for affordable residential projects, along with easier foreign borrowing rules for housing, will help builders access money for reviving stalled projects.\n\nNot all are convinced. The move to revive homes sales -- hit by a series of economic shocks -- may not be enough, said Jaxay Shah, chairman of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India last month lowered its growth forecast for the economy to 6.9% for the year to March, while cutting interest rates by a cumulative 110 basis points so far this year.\n\n(Updates with details of stimulus from third paragraph)\n\n--With assistance from Dhwani Pandya and Bibhudatta Pradhan.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Siddhartha Singh in New Delhi at ssingh283@bloomberg.net;Shruti Srivastava in New Delhi at ssrivastav74@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nasreen Seria at nseria@bloomberg.net, ;Unni Krishnan at ukrishnan2@bloomberg.net, Karthikeyan Sundaram, Arijit Ghosh\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars.\u00a0Sign up here.\u00a0India unveiled new measures involving a more than $7 billion boost to exporters and housing projects, as part of efforts to revive a flagging economy.A program to refund taxes and levies", "authors": ["Siddhartha Singh", "Shruti Srivastava"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/c7HIKT8TMekixS1Ise7PpA--~B/aD04MTI7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/d16024443e5f03911c7e89a786050ead", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
