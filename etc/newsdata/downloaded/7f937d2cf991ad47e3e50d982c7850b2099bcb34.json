In her first music video since Rainbow came out, Kesha dons a double-decker wig and plays a beloved televangelist. Beloved by everyone except her distant, angry, abusive husband. Sitting in her all-white house? Treating her like that? Not anymore! So, Kesha packs up the body \u2014 I mean, random stuff that just needs to be buried \u2014 and heads out on the run, scarf blowing in the wind. Amy Dunne would be proud because that girl is gone. \u201cOh, my mother raised me well / I don\u2019t wanna go to heaven without raising hell,\u201d she sings. \u201cRaising Hell,\u201d a toe-tapping pop song not unlike \u201cTimber,\u201d features Big Freedia. Kesha\u2019s upcoming album, High Road, is her letting out a joyful noise after somber Rainbow. Her balls are back and \u201cthey\u2019re bigger than ever,\u201d she jokes in the album trailer.\n\nRelated", "description": "Kesha is back with a brand-new music video and single, \u201cRaising Hell,\u201d featuring Big Freedia.
