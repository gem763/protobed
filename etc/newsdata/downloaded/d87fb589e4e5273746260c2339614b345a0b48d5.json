These are the martyrs of today!\u201d he said.\n\nToday\u2019s martyrs, like the martyrs of the first years of Christianity, are filled with courage by the Holy Spirit, who strengthens them in their witness up to death, Francis said.\n\n\u201cThe Apostles did not let themselves be intimidated by anyone. They had an impressive courage!\u201d he recalled, referring to the days after the coming of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost.\n\n\u201cWe think of them as cowards because they all ran away, they ran away when Jesus was arrested. But they were transformed from cowards into brave men. Why? Because the Holy Spirit was with them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe same happens to us: if we have the Holy Spirit inside, we will have the courage to move forward, the courage to overcome many struggles, not by ourselves but because of the Spirit that is with us. They did not retreat in their mission as intrepid witnesses of the Risen Jesus, like the martyrs of all times, including our own,\u201d he said.\n\nThe apostles\u2019 determination made the \u201creligious system\u201d of their day tremble, he said, because \u201cit felt threatened and responded with violence and death sentences,\u201d something we still witness today.\n\n\u201cThe persecution of Christians is always the same: people who do not want Christianity feel threatened and thus put Christians to death,\u201d he said.\n\nIsraeli Researchers: Turkey's Greek, Armenian, and Assyrian Christians Destroyed by \u201830-year Genocide\u2019 https://t.co/aRjCReVK4W \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 19, 2019\n\nThe pope went on to reflect that merely human projects all eventually fail, but God\u2019s projects endure forever.\n\n\u201cHuman projects always fail; they have their time, as we do,\u201d he said. \u201cThink of so many political projects, and how they change everywhere, in all countries. Think of the great empires, think of the dictatorships of the last century: they felt very powerful, they thought they dominated the world. And then they all collapsed.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven today, think of today\u2019s empires: they will collapse, if God is not with them, because the strength that men have in themselves is not lasting. Only the strength of God endures,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cLet us think of the history of Christians, including the history of the Church, with so many sins, with so many scandals, with so many bad things in these two millennia. And why didn\u2019t it collapse? Because God is there,\u201d he reflected.\n\n\u201cWe are sinners, and so often we give scandal. But God is with us,\u201d he said, \u201cand God saves us.\u201d\n\nThe Vanishing: Report Exposes Persecution of Middle East Christians as \u2018Close to Genocide\u2019 https://t.co/Ig2NuNoPAr \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 3, 2019\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "Pope Francis reflected on Christian persecution, recalling the 21 Egyptian Christians whose throats were cut by Islamic State militants.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
