In that time, there have been a series of deaths on the roads caused by drivers breaking down in a live lane of traffic.\n\nHighways England said it will not build any more 'smart motorways' because too many motorists do not understand them and are confused about when they can use the hard shoulder\n\nOn smart motorways, the hard shoulder is replaced by a lane to cut congestion, leaving drivers who suddenly break down stuck in the midst of fast traffic and forcing others behind them to abruptly change lanes. Though parking refuges are available at intervals, they cannot always be reached by drivers whose cars fail.\n\nYesterday Jim O\u2019Sullivan, the Highways England chief, admitted that some of those tragedies could have been averted, had stopped vehicle detection systems been in place. Lilian Greenwood, chairman of the Commons transport committee, asked: \u2018If stopped vehicle detection had been in place on all-lane-running schemes from the start, how many deaths would have been prevented?\u2019\n\nMr O\u2019Sullivan told MPs: \u2018It\u2019s impossible to quantify. Of the eight fatalities, undoubtedly one or two might have been avoided, but not all of them would.\u2019\n\nSmart motorways have been developed as a way of increasing capacity and reducing congestion without the more costly process of widening roads\n\nHighways England is testing a Swedish system, but it has hit problems using it in different types of weather. Mr O\u2019Sullivan said: \u2018This is ground-breaking technology. We had to prove it before we could roll it out.\u2019 Four people were killed on the M1 in just ten months after being hit by traffic in a live lane that used to be the hard shoulder. In each case, the victim had failed to reach a refuge area.\n\nFigures revealed that 19,316 motorists suffered the horror of breaking down in a live lane in 2017 and 2018 \u2013 a rate of 26 a day.\n\nTo add to the concerns, Mr O\u2019Sullivan also revealed that smart motorways will no longer be built with semi-permanent hard shoulders because drivers find them \u2018too complicated\u2019.\n\nHowever, many drivers consider them relatively safer than all-lane-running smart motorways, which have regularly spaced refuges.\n\nThe Government has spent millions on gantries and control rooms to tell drivers when they can use the hard shoulder.\n\nBut Mr O\u2019Sullivan told the transport committee: \u2018We get people confused between it being a hard shoulder and a running lane, and we get people who stop there when it\u2019s a running lane.\u2019\n\nThe announcement means the hard shoulder could become a thing of the past once the entire motorway network is converted to all-lane-running, or ALR. Mr O\u2019Sullivan admitted there is a \u2018higher likelihood\u2019 of breaking down on an ALR motorway than a traditional one.\n\n\u2018Partly this is because they are busier roads,\u2019 he said. \u2018In many cases our busiest motorways are commuting motorways. It\u2019s more likely you will have checked your tyres and fuel level before setting off on a longer journey.\u2019\n\nPressed on whether he would prefer to break down in the live lane of a smart motorway or a conventional one, Mr O\u2019Sullivan said only that he would rather not break down in the first place.\n\nRAC head of roads policy Nicholas Lyes said stopped vehicle detection \u2018needs to be retrofitted to all existing smart motorways as a matter of urgency\u2019.\n\nA Highways England spokesman said stopped vehicle technology will be on all schemes built from 2020 and added: \u2018We are retrofitting it on the M3 and are developing a rollout programme for other existing all-lane-running schemes. Smart motorways have more safety features than conventional motorways.\u2019", "description": "Drivers\u00a0 have been killed on so-called smart motorways because of delays in installing technology to spot broken-down vehicles, the boss of Highways England said yesterday.", "authors": ["Tom Payne For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/20/20094896-0-image-a-6_1571857588875.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
