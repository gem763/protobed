Where are they taking us?", "language": "en", "text": "Sixty-five years later, the new stairs-to-nowhere are \u201cstepped seating\u201d \u2014 though it may look like the thing in high school you called \u201cbleachers\u201d \u2014 and it\u2019s become one of the most Instagrammable and possibly the most overused architectural features of the decade.\n\nThe swanning is still part of the point, but they\u2019re also for sitting and waiting. Sitting and working. Sitting and eating. Watching and being watched. We have entered a new golden age for butts on steps not seen since the Colosseum.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s a Friday night at the Wharf, Washington\u2019s $2.5 billion redevelopment of the Anacostia waterfront, where the stepped seats leading up to the open-air bar of Cantina Bambina are like the Chichen Itza of vodka sodas.\n\nConcertgoers hike to a higher elevation to meet their friends before the EDM show across the street; a teenager in a dinosaur T-shirt claims the top tier as her solo dance platform. But careful \u2014 don\u2019t confuse these dramatic thigh-high risers for an actual user-friendly stairway: A guy on a date catches his toe on an edge and trips on his way up. A waiter finds himself separated from the functional steps by the banister. \u201cOh, the stairs are on this side,\u201d he said, sheepishly, to a bystander smoking a cigarette. The whole front of the restaurant was stairs, but there was still only one path to the top.\n\nStepped seating is big these days in tech headquarters \u2014 Slack, Evernote, Amazon Ring, and Facebook all have it. They\u2019ve replaced some tables at certain locations of Sweetgreen and Beefsteak. They\u2019re in the lobbies of the Line and the Eaton hotels in Washington. Many have taken their cues from New York\u2019s TKTS booth \u2014 a glowing glass staircase that looks out over Times Square \u2014 as well as the city\u2019s High Line and redesigned Domino Park.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI kind of think of them as a little theater of the street,\u201d said Nico Wright, an associate at San Francisco\u2019s CMG Landscape Architecture. They\u2019re great for people-watching, a place where we can be alone, together. \u201cYou think you\u2019re in a position of anonymity or safety, but you\u2019re also definitely on display.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder they\u2019ve become such Instagram magnets, though architects insist they\u2019re not designed with that in mind. But like all things that have become social media favorites, after a while, stairs to nowhere can feel like a dead end.\n\nFrom the Mayan pyramids to the Spanish Steps to the Lincoln Memorial, stairs have always held a place between the functional and the symbolic \u2014 getting us where we need to go but also elevating us to sacred spaces and making us feel exalted. The metaphor is of a stairway to heaven, said Val Warke, a professor of architectural theory at Cornell University, which may be why \u201cthe idea of a disjunctive stair that doesn\u2019t really go anywhere\u201d \u2014 as in those mind-boggling M.C. Escher drawings \u2014 \u201cis always sort of a fascination.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne of the newest tourist attractions in New York, the Thomas Heatherwick-designed Vessel, is a 150-foot tall cyclone of stairs-to-nowhere, inspired by Indian stepwells from around 650 A.D. Visitors come from miles around to hoof it up 16 stories, even waiting in line for the special selfie spot midway up. And of course, at the top, they can take in the stunning views of . . . Weehawken, N.J. on one side and a mall on the other.\n\nSome of the earliest stairs were built around 3000 B.C., for Sumerian ziggurats, but stairs intended for seating came about 2,000 years later and were an established feature by the time of the Archaic Greek period, said Brian Rose, an archaeology professor at the University of Pennsylvania. By 80 A.D., when the Romans opened their Colosseum, stair seating brought a familiar hierarchy: The wealthier and more important people got to be closer to the action.\n\nBut as it\u2019s used in the workplace today, architects say, the new stepped seating is meant to break down those hierarchies \u2014 creating casual gathering spaces where anyone can have an impromptu meeting, or give a presentation.\n\n\u201cIt encourages people to stay in their moment of thought,\u201d said Danu Kennedy, design director for Parts and Labor, the firm that designed the Eaton\u2019s lobby steps, \u201cas opposed to being like, \u2018We have a conference room scheduled for this time.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAre stairs-to-nowhere the new open floor plan? Or are they the new foosball table? As with so many other innovations in \u201cfun\u201d office design, they\u2019re quite clearly a way of cramming more seating into a smaller space.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThey\u2019re also, frankly, an open act of hostility toward women who wear short skirts. And unless they\u2019re \u201cstramps\u201d \u2014 a terrible word for a combination stair/ramp \u2014 they\u2019re inaccessible to many disabled visitors. They make you feel like you\u2019re in a high school marching band. Besides, they\u2019re just plain uncomfortable.\n\nWhen Emily Stock, a 24-year-old media relations specialist for Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, was sent to New York for a conference at PayPal\u2019s headquarters in April, she was initially impressed by the recently redesigned space. Then she learned she\u2019d be sitting on the risers at \u201cCentral Park,\u201d the company\u2019s stepped-seat event space \u2014 for two-and-a-half days.\n\n\u201cThere was padding for your butt, but there was nothing to lean back on,\u201d she said. After a day of typing notes hunched over her laptop, she had a backache. \u201cI\u2019m 24 years old, but by the time I left I felt like I was 84. . . . It wasn\u2019t designed for people to be sitting there for more than a few hours.\u201d\n\nThere was nowhere to put her stuff, so she set a coffee on the bench seat, and, naturally, bumped into it a few minutes later. \u201cIt flew forward into my purse. I had to spend an entire session cleaning out my bag,\u201d she said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNow, some architects are wondering whether their industry has started to overstep. Lately, stepped seating \u201cseems to get jammed into, like, almost every single lobby project that you see nowadays,\u201d said Wright.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll always joke about it: \u2018We can\u2019t do this again,\u2019 \u201d said Primo Orpilla, principal and founder of the firm O + A, which designed the Slack headquarters. Tech office trends have been taking design cues from rec rooms for decades now, and stairs are beginning to remind him of the beanbag chair, the cool office signifier of the late \u201990s. \u201cWill this turn into that?\u201d he asked. \u201cObviously, there always is the risk.\u201d\n\nYet for now, dead-end stairs captivate us. \u201cIt\u2019s something to do with the way we like to congregate,\u201d said Nick Leahy, a co-CEO of Perkins Eastman, and the design principal for the TKTS stairs. \u201cWe like to find vantage points to understand the space around us.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOr maybe we just want to live the metaphor. We are always climbing and getting nowhere, and wouldn\u2019t it be nice to sit down?\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n\u2018You can never have too many mimosas\u2019: How brunch became the day-wrecking meal that America loves to hate\n\nRamen, noise and rebellion: David Chang defines the decade in food\n\nDoes this train station smell like ... grapefruit?
