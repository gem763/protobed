These campaigns created an atmosphere for his assassination.\u201d\n\nMs. King\u2019s father was fatally shot in Memphis in 1968 at the age of 39. He had been the subject of bogus conspiracy theories prior to his death, including efforts by his political opponents to discredit him as a communist and sexual deviant.\n\nFacebook has recently come under fire for refusing to fact-check political ads placed on its platform, effectively allowing candidates for office to make bogus claims unabated.\n\nSpeaking at Georgetown, Mr. Zuckerberg mentioned King twice defending Facebook\u2019s policies as being important to freedom of expression.\n\n\u201cIn times of social turmoil, our impulse is often to pull back on free expression. We want the progress that comes from free expression, but not the tension,\u201d said Mr. Zuckerberg. \u201cWe saw this when Martin Luther King Jr. wrote his famous letter from Birmingham Jail, where he was unconstitutionally jailed for protesting peacefully.\u201d\n\n\u201cPulling back on free expression wasn\u2019t the answer and, in fact, it often ended up hurting the minority views we seek to protect,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said at Georgetown.\n\nMr. Zuckerberg mentioned King later in his speech while referring to a First Amendment case heard by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for a private company to censor politicians or the news in a democracy. And we\u2019re not an outlier here. The other major internet platforms and the vast majority of media also run these same ads,\u201d said Mr. Zuckerberg.\n\n\u201cAmerican tradition also has some precedent here,\u201d he added. \u201cThe Supreme Court case I mentioned earlier that gave us our current broad speech rights, New York Times vs Sullivan, was actually about an ad with misinformation, supporting Martin Luther King Jr. and criticizing an Alabama police department. The police commissioner sued the Times for running the ad, the jury in Alabama found against the Times, and the Supreme Court unanimously reversed the decision, creating today\u2019s speech standard.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Facebook said the company appreciates Ms. King\u2019s input and offer to meet, Reuters reported.\n\n\u201cHer perspective is invaluable and one we deeply respect. We look forward to continuing this important dialogue with her in Menlo Park next week,\u201d said the spokesperson.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
