But Tuesday is looking tougher as investors face up to disappointing results from Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, while Apple AAPL, -1.52% and Facebook FB, -0.16% report earnings on Wednesday.\n\nWe\u2019re also a day away from a potential interest-rate cut from the Federal Reserve. Expectations of this have been credited by some for helping stocks rebuild strength since October\u2019s rocky start.\n\nBut our call of the day from strategists at UBS warns a big threat is lying in wait for equities: earnings expectations.\n\n\u201cEvery bear market of the past 50 years has witnessed an actual decline in S&P 500 forward earnings,\u201d says lead strategist Francois Trahan, who lays out a deteriorating landscape in a note to clients.\n\nHe says the consensus year-on-year growth rate in S&P 500 forward earnings has dropped to a mere 1% from a peak of 23% in September 2018. And leading economic indicators, which forecast future activity and can offer clues on future earnings trends, also hint at more weakness ahead, as this chart shows:\n\n\u201cUltimately, the most vulnerable macro backdrop for equities occurs when forward earnings growth turns negative as LEIs are trending downward (pushing [price-to-earnings] lower),\u201d says Trahan, who offers another ominous chart:\n\nHe also suggests investors do not count on the Fed throwing stocks a lifeline here because interest rates and equities are positively correlated at present, which means if rates are lower stocks will follow, as was the reaction after the last two cuts.\n\nRead: The U.S. is like a banana republic and a depression could be on the way, warns money manager\n\nThe market\n\nThe Dow DJIA, +0.19% , S&P SPX, +0.21% and Nasdaq COMP, -0.30% are flat as trading kicks off, while European stocks SXXP, -0.28% are in the red.
