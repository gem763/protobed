Here's how the magic money dispenser evolved over the years. USA TODAY\n\nCorrections & clarifications: A previous version of this column misstated the deadline to file a claim on the Google Pixel class-action.\n\nSettlement money from a class-action lawsuit doesn\u2019t usually amount to much, maybe a few dollars. Occasionally, class-action suits can be very profitable for people other than the attorneys. I\u2019m a good example: I just received a check for almost $1,400.\n\nYou need to seek out these rare money opportunities. A regular reader of my weekly column wrote to tell me that he followed my advice and looked for his missing money. Just two weeks after reading that column, he received a check for over $25,000! You can check here now to see if you have any unclaimed money waiting for you to fill out some forms to get it.\n\n(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nThis is what the internet is best at, of course: connecting you to information that you would never find in your daily life. Keep reading to see what class-action lawsuits are paying out and how you can benefit from them.\n\nA few class-action lawsuits paying out right now:\n\nMyFord Touch, or MyLincoln Touch\n\nIf you bought a Ford vehicle before 2013 that had MyFord Touch or MyLincoln Touch installed, you might be owed as much as $400. That's for your Touch device not responding to voice commands, providing inaccurate directions, not connecting with your mobile device, misreading the location of your vehicle, and/or for freezing or crashing and causing other parts of the car not to function.\n\nSubmit your claim to MyFord Touch Class-Action Settlement website by Sept. 24, 2019, and to get your check.\n\nGoogle unveiled its first Pixel phone at a product event in San Francisco back in October 2016. (Photo: EPA/JOHN G MABANGLO ORG)\n\nGoogle Pixel Phone\n\nUntil January 2017, customers were complaining about the speakers failing on their first-generation Google Pixel phones. Google denied the allegations, but that didn't prevent them from settling the case for $7.25 million.\n\nIf you experienced a speaker or microphone problem with your Google Pixel, you have until Oct. 7, 2019, to file a claim on the settlement website.\n\nSirius\n\nAccording to the Sirius vs. Buchanan case, satellite radio broadcasting company Sirius XM made telemarketing calls to people on the National Do Not Call Registry. Like the Pixel case, Sirius XM has denied the charges, but they have agreed to remit three months or free service or cash payment.\n\nIf you remember receiving a call from Sirius XM between 2013 and 2016, and you are confident that you had joined the Do Not Call Registry by then, you may be entitled to either of these. You can file your claim on the settlement\u2019s website. Remember to file before Oct. 8, 2019.\n\nTrying to save money online?Here are three ways to find discounts for your prescriptions\n\nFile photo taken in 2012 shows a corporate sign at the headquarters of Equifax in Atlanta, Ga. (Photo: Mike Stewart, AP)\n\nEquifax\n\nThe Equifax Data Breach was one of the biggest stories of 2017. Millions of people learned that their information had been stolen, and hordes of customers were panicked about their financial data and credit scores.\n\nBy now, you are probably aware of the data breach and whether your records were affected. You can file a claim on the settlement\u2019s website until Jan. 22, 2020, which may entitle you to a cash reward, free credit monitoring and reimbursement for financial losses.\n\nFind your lost money: You may have unclaimed money just waiting for you to find it. Here are 4 places to look\n\nDo you really need to spend $1k? A new iPhone is coming. But no, you don't really have to pay new-phone prices\n\nHow to find class-action lawsuits you can benefit from\n\nIf you want to check out class-action lawsuits with open claims, try the Consumer Action Class Action Database.\n\nThis site lists class-action suits that are closed (ones that have awarded amounts to people and already paid out), pending (ones that are still in arbitration, letting you keep track of big ones that might be coming down the line), and cases that are currently open to claims (and are paying outright at this moment).\n\nThe Open to Claims page lists open class-action suits and the deadlines you have to reach out to lawyers and law groups to get a check as part of the suit. To see the list, click the direct link here, or go to the Class-Action Database page and click the \u201cOpen To Claims\u201d status.\n\nThe lawsuits will all be listed there, and they include the claim deadlines in big, underlined text. When you click on the claim deadline, you\u2019ll actually be navigated to where you input your information to get your check from the lawsuit, so the site makes it very easy to get the money you are owed.\n\nAfter you\u2019ve been through the current class-action suits, make sure you check back at other times to see when new ones pop up so you can keep getting checks.\n\nLittle amounts from different places add up over time. Who knows? Like me, you could be sitting on a big payout and just not know it.\n\nLearn about all the latest technology on The Kim Komando Show, the nation's largest weekend radio talk show.
