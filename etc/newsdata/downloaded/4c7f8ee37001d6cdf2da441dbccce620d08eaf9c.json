In partnership with the United Nations Development Programme, Amsterdam\u2019s FairChain Foundation has promised to back each token with funds that would\u2019ve otherwise gone towards marketing.\n\nThe idea is to turn products into \u201cengines of change\u201d by giving consumers a chance to participate in the system themselves, rather than blindly trust NGOs to do the right thing in places where it\u2019s needed the most.\n\nThis will hopefully inspire other companies to redirect their marketing budgets towards social impact and prove its effectiveness as a business model \u2013 all while giving a fair deal to Ecuadorian cocoa farmers.\n\n\u201cIf we can show that this proof of impact drives customer loyalty, and marketing spend given to consumers turns into impact, then we can reach out to all these large companies that now spend millions on Kim Kardashian and say, \u2018Don\u2019t spend your marketing on these famous faces, spend your marketing dollars on your own crowd, your own customers, and let them invest in impact,\u201d FairChain founder Guido van Staveren told Fast Company.\n\nIt\u2019s also about going one step further than \u201cFairtrade\u201d products. The Other Bar\u2018s website promises the initiative leaves 50 percent of the value generated by chocolate sales in Ecuador, where its cocoa is sourced, instead of just seven percent \u201clike most bars.\u201d It also claims Ecuadorian cocoa farmers are paid twice the industry average for their product.\n\nSource: Fast Company\n\nCourtesy of: UDNP/FairChain\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first blockchain pilot for the FairChain Foundation. In 2018, the firm teamed up with coffee wholesalers Moyee Coffee to run a similar initiative that promised to make business fairer for Ethiopian coffee farmers.\n\nAs for its chocolate pilot, 20,000 blockchain-powered bars are set to go on sale on October 14.
