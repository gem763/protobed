Brittany Charboneau, 31, was the first woman to break the tape, finishing in 2:44:47.\n\nWhile some would see the cool temperatures and driving rain as a challenge, Tropf thrived in the conditions.\n\n\u201cI absolutely loved the rain and temperature,\u201d Tropf said. \u201cMost of my training has been in 100 degrees and it\u2019s humid. Having the rain really worked to my advantage. The thing that really slowed me down was the wind at different points.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTropf, who grew up in Cleveland, went to the Naval Academy and then Johns Hopkins University for medical school. He has had to juggle training for the race with his residency in orthopedic surgery at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.\n\n\u201cTraining is really hit-or-miss with my job,\u201d Tropf said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to be consistent because you\u2019ve got to take calls. I don\u2019t write anything down so I don\u2019t have to make goals in my schedule or feel bad about missing training. This is what I do for fun, and I love coming out here and being competitive.\u201d\n\nTropf was feeling winded at the middle of the course, but noticing his distance from the other runners motivated him to keep pushing through.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI was toasted around mile 15 and 20, and that\u2019s the classic wall in the marathon,\u201d he said. \u201c[When] I realized no one was around me, I knew I could have a good finish, so I focused in and went to work.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAdam Stokes of the United Kingdom took second with a time of 2:28:59, and Matt O\u2019Neil of Woodbridge finished third in 2:31:30.\n\nCharboneau, meanwhile, came in with aspirations of breaking the course record of 2:37:00 set by Olga Markova in 1990.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be upset about winning a marathon,\u201d said Charboneau, from Golden, Colo. \u201cBut it was definitely a tough day, and I\u2019m bummed.\n\n\u201cThe weather was a little more of a challenge with the dead spots on the course where there wasn\u2019t anyone cheering. I think that was a little more a mental challenge. But once I got to parts where the crowd was, that was definitely a boost.\u201d\n\nMargarita Quintero of Mexico was second in 2:48:22, and Selvi Rajagopal of Columbia was third in 2:50:42.\n\nAD", "description": "Jordan Tropf is first man across the finish line.
