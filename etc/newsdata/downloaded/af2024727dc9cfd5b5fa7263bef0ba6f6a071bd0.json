Do you sense dread? It\u2019s not there.\n\nThere is a different tenor to what awaits Wednesday night in the hills of Los Angeles. It has to do with this past week and this past season, the characters who are at the controls, and the status and psyche of the opponent. This time, the Nationals can view what\u2019s ahead as an opportunity to seize. The Dodgers conversely might see it as an implosion to avoid. There\u2019s a glass-half-full-or-half-empty element to what will transpire when Stephen Strasburg takes the mound for Washington as the sun sets over the Pacific. Darned if there isn\u2019t a lot of milk in this cup \u2014 for the moment.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLet\u2019s be clear about a few things: The Dodgers absolutely could beat the Nationals Wednesday night. They won 106 games. They will pitch right-hander Walker Buehler, who already shut out the Nats over six innings in Game 1. They will have lefty Clayton Kershaw, arguably the best pitcher of his generation, in the bullpen on full rest. Their lineup is loaded, deep, balanced and expertly deployed.\n\nA win for the Dodgers would be a win for chalk, and would surprise just about no one outside of the Nats\u2019 own clubhouse.\n\nRemember when the Nats held that status? The players don\u2019t bother trying.\n\n\u201cOnce you start thinking about how things could have been or what things might happen,\u201d Strasburg said, \u201cit takes your focus away from what your job is.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nFocus on your job, Stephen, because that\u2019s important. The rest of us can consider what might be different this time, as well as what already is.\n\nAD\n\nStart with the Dodgers themselves. They have won the past seven N.L. West titles. They have won the past two N.L. pennants. There is one acceptable result this October: win the franchise\u2019s first World Series since 1988.\n\nThink the Nats, who have never advanced past this stage, feel any sort of pressure? Maybe. The Dodgers\u2019 quest hangs over the entire city.\n\n\u201cI think that anybody\u2019s going to feel pressure,\u201d Buehler said. \u201cI think it\u2019s more about what you do with it.\u201d\n\nNow consider the venue. Dodger Stadium holds some 56,000 people. No club draws more fans. When full \u2014 and when the bass-pumping P.A. system is really thumping \u2014 it can be head-splitting.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be 45,000 fans there,\u201d said Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts, selling his fan base a little short. \u201cAs a fan, as a player, you live for moments like this.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut it can also be . . . eerily quiet. When that many people gather in one place and collectively sit on their hands \u2014 as nervous home crowds can do when the pressure intensifies \u2014 the collective silence not only provides nothing to the home team, but can inspire the visitors. \u201cFire \u2019em up at home?\u201d Sure. But that\u2019s not as powerful as, \u201cShut \u2019em up on the road.\u201d\n\nThis is the first time the Nats will play a Game 5 away from the District. Remember those vibes? In 2012, the day after Werth\u2019s bottom-of-the-ninth homer extended the season and provided the franchise with its best moment (to date), the Nats roared to a 6-0 lead over St. Louis after three innings. But Gio Gonzalez . . . we\u2019ll get to him.\n\nAD\n\nThe point is: Over time, the Game 5 crowds at Nats Park have been filled with more angst than glee. The six-run lead against the Cardinals evaporated into a miserable loss, which in a way set the stage for Scherzer allowing Joc Pederson\u2019s game-tying homer in the seventh inning of Game 5 in 2016, which in a way led to Gonzalez being granted a 4-1 lead in Game 5 in 2017 against the Cubs, before he . . .\n\nAD\n\nOkay, wait a second. Let\u2019s get to Gonzalez \u2014 only because we need to be reminded that the man taking the ball for the Nats on Wednesday isn\u2019t Gonzalez.\n\nIt\u2019s incredible to think that in two of the Nats\u2019 three Game 5s, Gonzalez got the ball. Yes, he was coming off his two best seasons \u2014 a 2.89 ERA in 2012 and a 2.96 ERA in 2017. But in each case, he was handed a lead \u2014 and promptly gave a chunk of it back. His combined effort in those two win-and-advance games: eight innings, eight hits, six runs, eight walks, 10 strikeouts.\n\nAD\n\nThe gulf between that character and the man to which the Nats will give the ball Wednesday spans the distance between South Capitol Street and Vin Scully Avenue. With a tip of the cap to Scherzer, whose draining seven-inning outing in Game 4 was necessary even to provide the flight west, Strasburg is the pitcher the Nats want at this moment against this team.\n\nAD\n\nDoubting that? Let\u2019s go over his stats from his two outings this postseason, one in relief in the wild-card game, one start against the Dodgers in Game 2: nine innings, five hits, one run, zero walks, 14 strikeouts, a .167 average and .391 on-base-plus-slugging percentage against.\n\nNeed more? It\u2019s worth reviewing that in five career postseason appearances, Strasburg has a .192 average and .451 OPS against, with a 0.64 ERA and 38 strikeouts and four walks in 28 innings. Buehler? Buehler is good, and the Nats, who managed only one hit against him in Game 1, have to figure out a way to scratch through. But Strasburg is a force who has an appreciation of what his franchise has been through to get another chance. For the first time, it\u2019s his, and that matters.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTo have another opportunity to move on, when you appreciate it a lot more \u2014 especially when you played a little bit longer \u2014 you start to realize how hard it is to get there,\u201d Strasburg said. \u201cAll you can really do is just give it everything you have.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe Nats are a flawed team. But they have given it everything they have to force this game. The pressure, for once, is demonstrably on the opponent. Against the built-to-win-it-all Dodgers, that guarantees nothing \u2014 other than the idea that these hours before first pitch should be more relaxed than in the past. Embrace the optimism and the opportunity. The Nationals have.\n\nRead more on the Washington Nationals:\n\nAD", "description": "The Dodgers are favored and playing at home, and as Washington knows well, that\u2019s not always beneficial.", "authors": ["Barry Svrluga", "Sports Columnist With Beat Writing Experience On Baseball", "Golf", "The Nfl", "College Basketball", "College Football", "Sports Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/DlMA_usaWNgqyoe6dlXnw2w1J9Q=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5KHPCNXJ64I6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
