However, Sarri has favoured Gonzalo Higuain and Mandzukic is yet to play a single minute under the former Chelsea boss.\n\nMandzukic is yet to feature for Juventus this season (Picture: Getty)\n\nUnited opened a dialogue with Juventus over Mandzukic when the Serie A giants made a move of their own for Lukaku but the Belgian was determined to move to Inter Milan to work with Antonio Conte.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNevertheless, United have maintained their interest in the veteran and their troubles in front of goal have only reinforced Solskjaer\u2019s desire to strengthen his attack in January.\n\nWhile Mandzukic would clearly provide some much-needed depth in attacking areas, he hasn\u2019t managed double figures in terms of league goals since the 2015/16 campaign and at 33 years of age the club would only be prepared to hand him an 18-month deal at most.\n\nThe move is out of line with the transfer policy Solskjaer adopted last summer when he targeted young, hungry British players that could develop in years to come. But while Solskjaer\u2019s young side are not exactly light on experience, they\u2019re lacking in know-how and few strikers on the market possess Mandzukic\u2019s temperament or pedigree.\n\nMandzukic's record at Juventus - all competitions 2015/16: Appearances 36, Goals 13\n\n2016/17: Appearances 50, Goals 11\n\n2017/18: Appearances 43, Goals 10\n\n2018/19: Appearances 33, Goals 10\n\nAnother key element is Solskjaer\u2019s acknowledgement that United\u2019s playing style will not change overnight.\n\nThe Norwegian has dispensed with former Jose Mourinho allies such as Marouane Fellaini, Ander Herrera and Lukaku as he tries to implement a new brand of football at Old Trafford but United\u2019s struggles in front of goal prove they\u2019ve found the transition difficult. Since Solskjaer\u2019s appointment in March, United have managed 16 goals in 15 league games.\n\nMandzukic, like Lukaku, is strong in the air, but plying him with crosses would not represent United\u2019s plan A ,with the Croatian instead providing back-up to Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford. That way, Solskjaer feels he can help bridge the gap as United transition to a new style of play, while at the same time refusing to sacrifice his own ideals.\n\nSolskjaer's record before and after permanent appointment Interim Permanent\n\nGames: 19 Games: 20\n\nWon: 14 Won: 6\n\nDrawn: 2 Drawn: 6\n\nLost: 3 Lost: 8\n\nGoals for: 40 Goals for: 18\n\nGoals against: 17 Goals against: 22\n\nAt the forefront of Solskjaer\u2019s thinking, however, is his growing acceptance that United are increasingly unlikely to be able to attract his long-term targets this winter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnited wanted Jadon Sancho last summer but their failure to qualify for the Champions League ended all hopes of signing the Dortmund star. Instead of targeting another right winger, Solskjaer decided to work with what he had in the hope that the club could revisit a move for Sancho in 2020.\n\nBut there are only so many areas of an ailing team that Solskjaer can ignore without turning to short-term fixes.\n\nMoussa Dembele is a target for United (Picture: Getty)\n\nUnited are interested in former Celtic striker Moussa Dembele but Lyon are tough negotiators and are unlikely to allow the Frenchman to leave midway through the season. Ousmane Dembele, the Barcelona winger, is another target but he\u2019d have far more attractive offers than Old Trafford should the Catalans decide to let him leave.\n\nWith long-term targets unavailable, Solskjaer is willing to compromise but it remains to be seen whether Mandzukic will take up the club\u2019s offer.\n\nJuventus were seeking between \u00a39-11m for the Croatian last summer but his lack of playing time under Sarri, combined with the club\u2019s growing wage bill, means they will accept a far smaller fee in January.\n\nMandzukic is now minded to leave Juventus but he has lucrative offers on the table from Qatar and America. The forward is 34 in May and is wary that his next contract could be his last in football.\n\nMORE: Eddie Howe sends message to Callum Wilson amid Man Utd transfer speculation", "description": "Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is ready to break his own transfer policy to sign Juventus forward Mario Mandzukic amid concerns his long-term targets will be unattainable come January,...", "authors": ["Sean Kearns"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1161659249_1570199610.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
