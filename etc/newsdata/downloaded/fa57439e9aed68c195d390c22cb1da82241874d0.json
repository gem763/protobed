Apple announced the lineup of phones last week amid concerns that the company was due to face a disappointing upgrade cycle due to a relatively limited set of new features and a lack of 5G compatibility.\n\nSee more: Apple drops price on new iPhone 11, undercuts Netflix and Disney on streaming\n\nAnalyst Daniel Ives of Wedbush said that his analysis of preorder data shows \u201cdelivery times extend[ed] across a number of models with many iPhones now slated for delivery two to three weeks after the Sept. 20 official release date.\u201d He said that \u201csome variants of the 256G iPhone 11 Pro\u201d along with some space gray and gold devices were showing strength.\n\nThe key question for Ives is whether Apple will be able to drive upgrades in China, as trade tensions between the U.S. and China are an area of concern. He estimates that 60 million to 70 million iPhones in China are ripe for upgrades and that Apple needs to convince about half of these users to buy new devices. Ives rates the stock at outperform with a $245 price target.\n\nOpinion: Apple iPhone event reveals a dramatic change in strategy\n\nInstinet\u2019s Jeffrey Kvaal is encouraged by longer shipment times for the new devices relative to their predecessors a year earlier. On Sunday, high-end Pro and Max devices were showing shipment times of about 17 days, compared with 11 for the XS/Max phones a year ago. The iPhone 11 was showing about 12 days for delivery, while the XR showed roughly nine days last year.\n\n\u201cWhile shipment times reflect the balance of supply and demand, our supply chain work indicates supply is flat year over year,\u201d wrote Kvaal, who has a neutral rating and $185 target on shares. \u201cWe interpret that to mean the 11 is off to a healthy start in the U.S.\u201d\n\nOpinion: Apple\u2019s new iPhones are overpriced and behind the times\n\nEvercore ISI\u2019s Amit Daryanani said in a note to client that he sees \u201cinherent upside\u201d to Apple\u2019s September-quarter earnings estimates given that the company isn\u2019t staggering the launch of its three new models.\n\n\u201cThis we think will have a positive impact to revenues and EPS in the September quarter, though depending on the reception of these products, it may be more of a pulling in of revenues from December quarter,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe think Apple will likely be more aggressive with their trade-in programs to further incentivize customers to purchase the new phones.\u201d\n\nDaryanani rates Apple\u2019s stock at outperform and raised his price target to $247 from $238.\n\nSee also: Is the new iPhone 11 too big? Here\u2019s the real reason Apple hasn\u2019t launched a pocket-sized device\n\nApple shares gained 0.5% in midday trading Monday, bouncing back from a tough day on Friday but staying barely lower than the $1 trillion market-capitalization threshold, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.52% fell 0.5%. Apple stock has increased 14.1% over the past three months, compared with a 3.8% gain in that time for the Dow, which counts Apple as a component.", "description": "Encouraging data points around iPhone preorders and a more simplified rollout than last year\u2019s could bode well for Apple Inc., analysts say.", "authors": ["Emily Bary"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR387_iPhone_ZG_20190916130302.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
