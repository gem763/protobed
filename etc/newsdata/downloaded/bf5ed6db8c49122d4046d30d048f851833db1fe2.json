It is also well below the 20% level to which Iran enriched uranium before the deal. The 3.67% cap lasts 15 years.\n\nENRICHMENT CAPACITY\n\nIran has two vast enrichment sites, at Natanz and Fordow. Much of Natanz is deep underground and Fordow is buried inside a mountain, which is widely believed to protect them from aerial bombardment.\n\nThe deal allows Iran to continue enrichment at Natanz but with constraints. It turns Fordow into a \u201cnuclear, physics and technology centre\u201d where centrifuges are used for purposes other than enrichment, such as producing stable isotopes.\n\nThe JCPOA also:\n\n- Slashes the number of centrifuges installed in Iran to roughly 6,000 from around 19,000 before the deal\n\n- Only allows Iran to produce enriched uranium with its first-generation IR-1 centrifuges\n\n- Allows Iran to use small numbers of more advanced centrifuges for research, but without accumulating enriched uranium, for 10 years\n\nURANIUM STOCK\n\nThe deal caps Iran\u2019s stock of low-enriched uranium at 300 kg of uranium hexafluoride enriched to 3.67% or its equivalent for 15 years. That corresponds to 202.8 kg of uranium, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is policing the deal\u2019s restrictions.\n\nIran produced tonnes before the deal. Any excess enriched uranium was either downblended to the level of natural uranium or shipped out of the country in exchange for natural uranium.\n\nThe United States said in 2015 the deal reduced Iran\u2019s stockpile of enriched uranium by 98%, to less than the amount needed for one weapon from enough for about 10.\n\nCUTTING OFF THE PLUTONIUM TRACK\n\nIran was further from being able to produce a weapon with plutonium than with uranium. It was building a heavy-water reactor at Arak that could eventually have produced spent fuel from which plutonium could be separated.\n\nUnder the JCPOA:\n\n- The core of that reactor has been removed and filled with concrete to make it unusable\n\n- The reactor is being redesigned so as to \u201cminimise the production of plutonium and not to produce weapon-grade plutonium in normal operation\u201d\n\n- All spent fuel from Arak will be shipped out of Iran, for the reactor\u2019s lifetime\n\n- Iran commits not to engage in reprocessing or reprocessing research activities for 15 years\n\n- Iran can continue to produce heavy water, used as a moderator in reactors like Arak, but its stock is capped around 130 tonnes. It has previously shipped excess amounts abroad for storage or sold them. This restriction lasts 15 years.\n\nMORE INTRUSIVE OVERSIGHT\n\nThe JCPOA:\n\n- Requires Iran to apply the IAEA\u2019s Additional Protocol - which grants the agency wide-ranging inspection powers - and \u201csubsequently seek ratification and entry into force\u201d\n\n- Grants IAEA inspectors daily access to Natanz and Fordow for 15 years\n\n- Says the deal\u2019s signatories must vet Iran\u2019s purchases of nuclear or dual-use equipment\n\n- Bans Iran from carrying out a range of activities that could contribute to making a nuclear bomb, such as computer simulations of a nuclear explosion or designing certain multi-point detonation systems. In some cases, those activities can be carried out with the other signatories\u2019 approval.", "description": "Iran has committed a further breach of its nuclear deal with major powers by enriching uranium with advanced centrifuges, and plans to install more of those advanced machines than previously announced, a U.N. nuclear watchdog report showed on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
