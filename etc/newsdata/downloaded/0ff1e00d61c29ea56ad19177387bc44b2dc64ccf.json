REUTERS/Mike Theiler\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer and Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican, asked Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai to review approvals of China Telecom and China Unicom to operate in the United States made in the early 2000s.\n\n\u201cThese state-owned companies continue to have access to our telephone lines, fiber optic cables, cellular networks and satellites in ways that could give it (China) the ability to target the content of communications of Americans or their businesses and the U.S. government, including through the \u2018hijacking\u2019 of telecommunications traffic by redirecting it through China,\u201d the senators wrote in a letter, which was also sent to the departments of defense and homeland security.\n\nThe FCC in May voted unanimously to deny another state-owned Chinese telecommunications company, China Mobile Ltd, the right to provide services in the United States, citing risks that the Chinese government could use the approval to conduct espionage against the U.S. government. The FCC disclosed at the time that it was reviewing existing approvals.\n\nPai \u201chas made it clear that the Commission is reviewing other Chinese communications companies such as China Telecom and China Unicom,\u201d FCC spokesman Brian Hart said.\n\nChina Mobile had sought approval in 2011 to provide interconnection services for phone calls between the United States and other countries which would have given it enhanced access to U.S. telephone lines, fiber-optic cable, cellular networks and communications satellites.\n\nThe FCC voted 5-0 in May to deny the application, with Commissioner Brendan Carr saying \u201cChina Telecom has been hijacking U.S. traffic and redirecting it through China.\u201d\n\nGeoffrey Starks, another FCC commissioner, said \u201cthe national security environment has changed since those (earlier) applications were granted.\u201d He said it was a \u201ctop priority\u201d to address concerns about other carriers.\n\nThe Trump administration is waging a broader campaign to limit the role of Chinese telecommunications firms in the build-out of 5G networks.\n\nIn May, the Trump administration banned Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] from buying vital U.S. technology without special approval and effectively barring its equipment from U.S. telecom networks on national security grounds.\n\nThe United States in August extended a reprieve that permits Huawei to buy components from U.S. companies to supply existing customers but also added more than 40 of Huawei\u2019s units to its economic blacklist.", "description": "Two U.S. senators on Monday asked the FCC and national security agencies to review whether two Chinese state-owned telecom companies should be allowed to operate in the United States, at a time of heightened concern about possible Chinese spying.", "authors": ["David Shepardson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430541669&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F1CD-OCATC", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
