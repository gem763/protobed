Her weekly demonstrations outside the Swedish parliament, beginning a year ago, spotlighted the increasing urgency of the climate crisis and spurred the \u201cFridays for Future\u201d school strikes by millions of students around the world.\n\n\u201cWe, who together are the movement Fridays for Future, are fighting for our lives,\u201d Ms. Thunberg said Monday. \u201cBut not only that, we are also fighting for our future children and grandchildren, for future generations, for every single living being on Earth whose biosphere we share, whose biosphere we are stealing, whose biosphere we are ruining. We are fighting for everyone.\u201d\n\nMs. Thunberg is the 18th recipient of the Ambassador of Conscience Award, which is Amnesty International\u2019s highest honor for advancing the cause of human rights. Past awardees include Colin Kaepernick, Nelson Mandela and Malala Yousafzai.\n\nMs. Thunberg urged her audience to hold leaders and politicians accountable not only for the ecological consequences of their policies, but also for the humanitarian disasters that accompany those consequences, including famine, war and mass migration.\n\n\u201cDespite all the beautiful words and promises from our leaders, we are still moving in the wrong direction with unimaginable pace,\u201d she said. \u201cThe world has never seen a human rights threat of this scope.\u201d\n\nWhile Ms. Thunberg said swift and drastic action is needed to prevent catastrophic climate change, she also said progress on the issue gives her hope for the future.\n\n\u201cI think there is an awakening going on,\u201d she said. \u201cEven though it is slow, the pace is picking up, and the debate is shifting.\u201d\n\nA range of speakers joined Ms. Thunberg at the award program, including youth activist Tokata Iron Eyes of the Standing Rock Sioux Nation, actors Sophia Bush and Maggie Gyllenhaal and Ms. Gyllenhaal\u2019s 12-year-old daughter, Ramona Sarsgaard.\n\nMs. Gyllenhaal credited her daughter with her own activist awakening. Part of the reason children lead with clarity on the issue of climate change, she said, is not just that their lives will be most affected. It\u2019s because they don\u2019t use money, as adults do.\n\n\u201cThe skewed, mind-numbing logic of greed that got us into this position hasn\u2019t really infiltrated them yet, and they can\u2019t understand why we aren\u2019t doing anything,\u201d Ms. Gyllenhaal said. \u201cThey can\u2019t understand because it doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d\n\nA panel of youth activists, including GW first-year student Khadija Khokhar, joined Ms. Thunberg and Ms. Bush onstage for a discussion of life within the movement against climate change. Panelists agreed that the sense of community with their peers was essential to maintaining both their impetus and their sanity.\n\n\u201cAll nonviolent movements start with youth,\u201d Ms. Khokhar said.\n\nAmnesty International Secretary-General Kumi Naidoo agreed. \u201cIt is high time that we, as adults, did half as much as our children\u201d to fight climate change, he said.\n\n\u201cThese young leaders have laid down the challenge,\u201d Mr. Naidoo said. \u201cIn an apathetic world drifting towards calamity, they have stood up as our collective conscience and said, \u2018Enough is enough.\u2019 Now it\u2019s time for every single one of us to follow them.\u201d\n\nTo that end, Ms. Thunberg encouraged her audience to join her and other young activists in their general strikes Sept. 20 and 27.\n\n\u201cActivism works,\u201d Ms. Thunberg said. \u201cSo what I\u2019m telling you to do now is to act, because no one is too small to make a difference.\n\n\u201cAnd just one last thing: See you in the streets.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://gwtoday.gwu.edu/sites/g/files/zaxdzs1531/f/image/1_6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
