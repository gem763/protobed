The floodgates opened, and the Nationals widened the gap until the Marlins had no hope to grip. Adam Eaton added a run with a two-out single to left. Juan Soto added another by working a base-loaded walk. Kurt Suzuki smacked a three-run double, erasing any doubt, and that\u2019s how the Nationals found additional comfort atop the wild-card standings.\n\nThe victory, combined with another Chicago Cubs loss, gives them a four-game cushion \u00adbetween making and missing the postseason. The Milwaukee Brewers remain just a game behind Washington for the top spot. But the Cubs have lost five straight and are fading fast. The Nationals, now 15-3 against the Marlins, are 85-68 and have nine games left to play.\n\nDave Martinez makes his return to the Nationals\u2019 dugout\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just about picking each other up; it\u2019s a team game,\u201d Suzuki said of the bats covering up another eighth-inning meltdown. \u201cYou know, [the relievers] pick us up a lot. We pick them up a lot. It makes for some good chemistry.\u201d\n\nTo create that separation and nearly boil the wild-card race down to two teams, Washington had turned to the perfect pitcher in a big spot. In his four previous starts against the Marlins this season, Strasburg had a 4-0 record, 1.19 ERA and 43 strikeouts in 30\u2153 innings. The calculus of this is pretty simple: Miami is one of baseball\u2019s worst teams, and Strasburg is one of baseball\u2019s best pitchers. So when put against each other, Strasburg is bound to thrive way more often than not.\n\nBut so much success against one club \u2014 and for it to stretch for so long \u2014 is still a bit of an anomaly. Strasburg first used his bat to keep it going Saturday, hitting an RBI single with two outs in the second inning. Then he went seven innings for the 13th time this season.\n\nBoswell: Playoff chases are fun, aren\u2019t they, Nats fans? Why are you hiding under your desk?\n\n\u201cI kind of lost my command a little bit,\u201d Strasburg said of having to strand the bases loaded in his final inning. \u201cYou just try to take it one pitch at a time and go as long as you can.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals pieced together a rally in the fourth, and Yan Gomes punched his second hit to force third base coach Bob Henley into a decision. Henley, criticized for a questionable send earlier this week \u2014 and criticized often over the years \u2014 decided to wave Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera home. The alternative was bringing up Strasburg with one out and the bases loaded. The result was Cabrera, far from fast, getting thrown out by at least five feet. Cabrera, who had two hits and a walk, tweaked his ankle on the play and later left the game, subbed out for Dozier.\n\nThat helped Marlins starter Jordan Yamamoto navigate out of the jam. The offense later stretched the lead to 4-0 in the eighth inning. Strasburg, by that point, had completed his outing at 109 pitches. But that\u2019s when Rodney entered and the game unraveled on the Nationals.\n\nThe 42-year-old right-hander didn\u2019t have it from the start of the eighth. He gave up a leadoff double to Miguel Rojas and an RBI double to Starlin Castro two batters later and soon loaded the bases by yielding a walk and single. He only had one out. Martinez had both Tanner Rainey and Hunter Strickland warming in the bullpen. But the manager stuck with Rodney, even with his pitch count up to 23, and Austin Dean crushed a three-run double that knotted the score.\n\nRodney exited after giving up four hits, three of them doubles, in his second appearance in as many days. Then and only then did Martinez step out of the dugout and begin his walk to the mound. It was a batter too late. It was maybe a few batters too late.\n\n\u201cWe had guys up, but I know Fernando, and he typically can get out of a jam,\u201d Martinez said of not hooking Rodney before the Dean at-bat. \u201cHe\u2019s going to throw strikes. He was the guy for me right there.\u201d\n\nStrickland came in to steady the Nationals, stranding the go-ahead run on second, before the Nationals couldn\u2019t score off Jos\u00e9 Ure\u00f1a in the ninth. Wander Suero then blanked the Marlins in a one-two-three bottom half.\n\nThat led to extra innings, to a spot the Nationals didn\u2019t expect to be in, and that\u2019s when the final push began. Dozier, the club\u2019s everyday second baseman to start the season, has lost his spot to Cabrera in recent weeks. But he still started a rally that kept Rodney and Martinez from shouldering loads of blame. The path to the win was certainly not smooth. But it doesn\u2019t have to be at this time of year.\n\nRead more about baseball :\n\nAndy Green is out in San Diego \u2014 and a plum of a job opens\n\nAnthony Rendon\u2019s MVP case is gaining momentum, losing time\n\nKurt Suzuki is balancing health concerns with urgency of the race\n\nLuis Severino\u2019s return gives the Yankees a big arm for October", "description": "Stephen Strasburg dominates for seven innings but a six-run 10th is the difference in Miami.", "authors": ["Jesse Dougherty", "Reporter Covering The Washington Nationals."], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4OZVRFW44MI6TJUIGA3JH62LBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
