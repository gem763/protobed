The troupe is found guilty.\"\n\nAll five denied wrongdoing.\n\nSpeaking after the verdict, Zay Yar Lwin told reporters: \"I do not recognise the authority of the judiciary. Whether it is one day or a year makes no difference.\"\n\n'Freedom of expression in a dire state'\n\nMyanmar's government is increasingly using its powers to imprison people who criticise the authorities, including journalists, artists and dissidents.\n\nThe country's civilian government, led by Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, has made very few changes to the draconian laws it inherited from the five decades of military dictatorship that preceded it.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Little has changed under the civilian government led by Aung San Suu Kyi\n\nAmnesty International said the verdict against the Peacock Generation poets was \"appalling\".\n\n\"Punishing people for performing a piece of satire speaks volumes about the dire state of freedom of expression in Myanmar,\" Joanne Mariner, the human rights group's South East Asia research director, said.\n\n\"These activists are prisoners of conscience. They have already spent six months behind bars, just because the Myanmar authorities are too thin-skinned to tolerate the mildest criticism.\"\n\nAccording to Athan, a freedom of speech advocacy group in Myanmar, 26 people were charged under the same law in the first half of 2019.", "description": "Peacock Generation members were arrested after a performance making fun of the country's military.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/17B20/production/_109465079_57678200_1949571785153059_8350257751682711552_o.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
