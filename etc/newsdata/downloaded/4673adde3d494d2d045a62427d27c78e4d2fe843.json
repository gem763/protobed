Leganes are bottom with five points.\n\nGranada, who are third on 20 points, could leapfrog Real and Barca to return to the top of the table when they visit Getafe on Thursday.", "description": "Real Madrid captain Sergio Ramos scored for the 16th La Liga season in a row as his side coasted to a 5-0 win at home to basement club Leganes in La Liga on Wednesday to move up to second in the standings.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446700419&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T20Z", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
