No, I don't think we have the data that we need at all,\" said Nick Stansbury, investment strategist at British insurer Legal & General's investment management unit, Britain's biggest asset manager with around $1.3 trillion under management.\n\n\"Disclosure is not necessarily so we can seek to change the numbers, but so we can start understanding and pricing the risks,\" Stansbury said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A THOUSAND WAYS TO PARIS\"\n\nThere are many voluntary initiatives and frameworks to unify carbon accounting and target setting; some overlap but none have been universally adopted. Further projects exist for other greenhouse gases such as methane.\n\nThe Greenhouse Gas Protocol is one such set of standards, established by non-governmental organizations and industrial groups in the 1990s.\n\nCompanies can report their progress in line with these standards through non-profit CDP, formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project, which then ranks them. Norway's Equinor comes first in its list of 24 oil major companies, but not all of them report in every year.\n\n\n\n\n\n(GRAPHIC: Big oil ranking by the CDP - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/6698/6680/CDP%20oil%20and%20gas%20company%20league%20table.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is also the Task Force on Climate related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), created by the G20's Financial Stability Board, as well as industry bodies, in-house models at oil firms and banks and third-party verifiers and consultants.\n\n\"There are a thousand ways to Paris,\" London-based BP's Chief Executive Bob Dudley said at a Chatham House event earlier this year referring to the 2015 accord aiming to keep global warming well below 2 degrees.\n\nBP Finance Chief Brian Gilvary told Reuters BP would welcome more consistency within the sector to show what oil companies are doing about emissions and that an industry body, the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI), was discussing carbon accounting.\n\nA plethora of third party ESG verifier companies were emerging with varying ways of measuring ESG metrics, he said, adding that some such firms would say to an oil company, \"We believe your score is this, and, by the way, if you spend $50,000 we'll show you how you can improve that score.\"\n\nUBS, with $831 billion of invested assets, has $2 billion in its Climate Aware passive equity strategy, which is in part based on a company's emissions reporting.\n\nIn that strategy \"we tilt towards companies that are better performing on a range of climate metrics and away from companies that do not perform so well in this respect,\" Francis Condon, executive director for sustainable investing, said.\n\n\"We don't want to be accused of greenwashing or falling for it,\" he said, adding that UBS regularly encouraged companies to prepare for the climate transition.\n\nUsing a broad measure, global sustainable investment reached $30.1 trillion across the world's five major markets at the end of 2018, according to the Global Sustainable Investment Review. This equates to between a quarter and half of all assets under management, due to varying estimates of that figure.\n\nCondon said most investors were still more focused on returns than wider sustainability criteria but were becoming concerned that companies may expose them to possible future climate-related financial losses.", "description": "Wide variations in the way oil companies report their efforts to reduce carbon emissions make it difficult to assess the risk of holding their shares as the world shifts away from fossil fuels, senior fund managers say.
