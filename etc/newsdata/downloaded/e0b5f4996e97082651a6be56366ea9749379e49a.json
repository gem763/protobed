Mr. McCarthy, who has been the company\u2019s CFO for more than four years, is expected to rejoin the company\u2019s board, pending shareholder approval.\n\nMr. Vogel is head of Spotify\u2019s financial planning and analysis, treasury and investor relations department. He joined Spotify in 2016 following roles as head of Barclays \u2019 internet and media research team, portfolio manager of AllianceBernstein\u2019s consumer, media and internet division, and as an analyst at Morgan Stanley.\n\nPaul Vogel is slated to become Spotify\u2019s next CFO in January when Barry McCarthy retires. Photo: Spotify The CFO change at Spotify comes as competition in the music-streaming industry intensifies, with companies such as Amazon and Apple increasing their efforts to win subscribers. Other players such as iHeartMedia Inc. are expanding podcast offerings, competing with Spotify in a key growth area. Revenue generated from podcasts grew in the past quarter, but it still makes up less than 10% of advertising revenue, Spotify said in its third-quarter earnings release. \u201cIt is a new fight, and a war on many fronts,\u201d said John Tinker, a senior media analyst at Gabelli & Co. The new CFO is expected to be involved by allocating capital for new investments, including in its podcast business, he added. Mr. Vogel is expected to stick to the company\u2019s previous goal of breaking even or producing a small profit while continuing to invest in growth. \u201cMaintaining the balance to keep growing while nurturing younger businesses is a core task at hand,\u201d said Justin Patterson, a senior research analyst at Raymond James Financial Inc. That could involve investments in a strategy intended to help Spotify charge artists and labels for data and services. The company plans to provide details about the so-called two-sided marketplace strategy in its fourth-quarter earnings report. Newsletter Sign-up Mr. Vogel could also focus on strengthening the company\u2019s ties with Wall Street following its 2018 direct listing, said Jason Helfstein, a managing director at Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. \u201cHe is in a good position to increase visibility with investors,\u201d Mr. Helfstein said. Spotify\u2019s share price has fallen 4.13% in the past year, while the S&P 500 has gained 13.74%, according to FactSet. Mr. Vogel told analysts on an earnings call Monday that he doesn\u2019t expect any major changes to how the organization is run. Spotify didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for additional comment. Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has a content partnership with Gimlet Media, a unit of Spotify.
