The startup and Entrepreneur First alumni had previously raised \u00a31.7 million in equity and a credit line of debt financing.\n\nPrevious investors include Global Founders Capital, Concrete VC (backed by Starwood Capital Group), Savills, EF, Trusted Insights, and Le Studio VC, along with angel investors Matt Robinson (Nested), Chris Mairs (EF) , Charlie Songhurst, Nicolas Berggruen, and Julian Critchlow.\n\nFounded in 2016 by Vadim Toader and Stefan Boronea, Proportunity wants to help first time buyers purchase a home that is more suited to their needs than a mortgage alone might afford.\n\nIt does this by providing an equity loan of up to 15% of a property\u2019s value to enable the home buyer to effectively put down a bigger deposit and therefore secure a more competitive mortgage. This, claims the startup, also enables the home buyer to potentially purchase a larger or better located property, and reduce the amount of interest charged by the mortgage lender in the long term.\n\nThe way it works, therefore, is quite similar to the U.K. government\u2019s \u201cHelp To Buy\u201d scheme, except it isn\u2019t restricted to a new build and you have to pay monthly interest on the loan from the get-go. Like Help To Buy, when you sell the house or remortgage it in five years time, you have to repay the Proportunity equity loan at 15 percent of the current market price.\n\nTherefore, if the price of the house has gone up, the amount you pay back will have also increased. In the event that the price has gone down, the startup loses money.\n\nAll of this is backed up by Proportunity\u2019s machine learning-based forecasting technology, which claims to be able to identify good value properties in up-and-coming areas. The idea is that better use of data \u2014 from crime and school ratings to broadband speeds and pollution \u2014 can help reduce the risk of equity-based property loans both for the lender and borrower.\n\nWith regards to how many homes Proportunity has helped finance, the startup isn\u2019t breaking out the exact numbers. However, co-founder Vadim Toader tells me it is \u201cmore than 20 and less than 100\u201d.\n\nHe also says that 2 of the top 5 high-street lenders in the U.K. have lent alongside Proportunity on multiple homes, proving that the model can be made to work (a year ago it wasn\u2019t clear how the market would respond to Proportunity\u2019s equity loan offer). The company is currently working with 12 mortgage brokers in total.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made partnerships with real estate agencies, and their mortgage broker arms, so they can refer the first time buyers that come to them directly,\u201d says Toader.\n\nMeanwhile, I asked Toader to run through what assumptions have proven true so far or haven\u2019t panned out.\n\nHe says that the team thought it would prove to be a complicated proposition to explain to customers, but actually they tend to get it quickly due to awareness of the U.K. government\u2019s Help to Buy scheme.\n\nHe also thought Proportunity could help speed up the home-buying process, but a few parts, such as conveyancing, can still take a few months.\n\nAnd despite Proportunity\u2019s data play, \u201cpeople do get emotionally attached to properties. Data helps them detach a bit, but not that much\u201d.", "description": "Proportunity, the startup that provides \u201chelp to buy\u201d-style equity loans primarily for first time property buyers, has raised \u00a32 million in additional funding.
