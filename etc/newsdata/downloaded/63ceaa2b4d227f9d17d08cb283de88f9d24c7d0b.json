He now is one of Washington's wise men. The first bookend was in 1974 when, as a freshman House member, he played a crucial role in the Judiciary Committee's deliberations on impeaching Richard Nixon \u2014 still, for all the differences, the best model for the Trump inquiry.\n\nAs a reporter covering the House and spending a good deal of time at the Judiciary Committee in 1974, I have a special appreciation of Cohen's insights and the differences between then and now.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn an interview, Cohen \u2014 a strong proponent of impeachment \u2014 says the House should soon pass a formal inquiry as it did in 1974; it's not required, but he notes it offers more legitimacy and takes away opponents\u2019 talking points.\n\nThe House then should complete any process before the 2020 election year, but Cohen cautions this has to be a thorough and credibly comprehensive effort: \"They should cancel all vacations, if necessary, between now and the rest of the year. They need to call a number of witnesses to elicit more information and determine if those that refuse to appear are part of any cover-up.\"\n\nIt's critically important, the former Maine lawmaker notes, \"to build a public case, to build a record.\" After Trump's call to shake down the Ukrainian President to investigate Joe Biden Joe BidenGiuliani says he is unaware of reported federal investigation Trump says Giuliani is still his lawyer Sondland to tell Congress 'no quid pro quo' from Trump: report MORE, a potential rival for Trump in the 2020 presidential election, public opinion has shifted to more favorably view impeachment; that support, however, remains very soft.\n\nThat was true in early 1974 too, Cohen recalls. And a number of Republicans, including Mississippi's Trent Lott, who went on to become Senate Majority Leader, were as intransigently opposed to impeaching Nixon as Jim Jordan James (Jim) Daniel JordanIn testimony, Dems see an ambassador scorned, while GOP defends Trump Ex-Ukraine ambassador arrives to give testimony Graham threatens to call Volker to testify if Democrats don't release testimony MORE and Devin Nunes Devin Gerald NunesMeet the lawyer at center of whistleblower case: 'It is an everyday adventure' Intelligence watchdog huddles with members as impeachment push grows Both sides dig in after marathon Trump-Ukraine briefing MORE are in the tank for Trump today.\n\nThe Ukrainian scandal is the easiest for the public and politicians to grasp and will be the centerpiece of any impeachment bill. The former House Judiciary Committee member argues there should be several articles dealing with abuse of power and obstruction of justice and should include a multitude of impeachable offenses.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe current House Judiciary Committee has botched this task, but Cohen is impressed with House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff Adam Bennett SchiffSunday Show Preview: Trump's allies and administration defend decision on Syria In testimony, Dems see an ambassador scorned, while GOP defends Trump Cracks emerge in White House strategy as witness testifies MORE \u2014 despite the California Democrat's faux pas in engaging in hyperbole at an initial forum last month: \"Schiff is a gifted lawyer,\u201d said Cohen. \u201cIf this gets to the Senate, you want him to be the chief prosecutor.\"\n\nI agree, with a caveat: Schiff should stay off cable television for now; he has a much more serious responsibility; others can air the public case with the talking heads.\n\nAny of us who covered the historic 1974 impeachment see significant differences. First, a year before, the Sam Ervin-led Senate Watergate Committee had established a record, including the existence of White House tapes and the devastating testimony of former Nixon counsel John Dean. In a narrower sense, the Mueller report laid out demonstrably impeachable offenses \u2014 but it was less conclusive.\n\nOther than the rough transcript the White House released of the call to the Ukrainian leader, this time there are no tapes \u2014 yet.\n\nAnother difference is that social media and cable television generate a more polarized politics, one reason the partisan lines are drawn more sharply today.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOn the other hand, impeachment was a more alien concept going into 1974; there had been no such move against a president in over a century. Conceptually, it's less unthinkable today. During Watergate even some critics acknowledged some of Nixon's governing skills \u2014 and worried over that loss. There is no such concern today.\n\nThere are those who argue why go through this ordeal if a conviction in the Republican Senate is out of the question? That's repeating the mistakes made in the flawed impeachment against Bill Clinton. (Nixon resigned before facing certain defeat in both houses.)\n\nCohen rejects the argument:\n\n\"This is presidential conduct you want to be ashamed of. He is corrupting institutions, politicizing the military, and acts like he is the law. If that is acceptable, we really don't have a Republic as we've known it any more.\"", "description": "Bill Cohen \u2014 as a freshman Republican House member \u2014 played a crucial role in the deliberations on impeaching Richard Nixon.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/cohenwilliam_101319getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
