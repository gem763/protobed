CEO Evan Spiegel, pictured here on September 4, have welcomed a baby boy Myles\n\n'We are overjoyed at the arrival of Myles and so appreciate everyone's kind words and wishes during this special time,' they said in a statement to People magazine.\n\n'We couldn't be more excited to welcome our beautiful son into our family.'\n\nThe Australian supermodel - who also has eight-year-old son Flynn with her ex-husband Orlando Bloom - announced that she and Evan were expecting their second child together just 10 months after she gave birth to Hart.\n\nAlthough she was thrilled to be expecting again, Miranda didn't have an easy pregnancy as it was plagued with morning sickness and erratic emotions.\n\nSmiling through it! Miranda, seen here in a sweet social media photo shared in August, endured morning sickness during her third pregnancy and was on bed rest for a time\n\nShe said previously: 'I suffered quite a lot of morning sickness and I was on bed rest for a little while, then I pinched a nerve in my neck. Every woman is different. For some reason... with each three of my pregnancies, I've been super nauseous and a little more sensitive.'\n\nHowever, she was relying on snacks to help her get through the nausea.\n\nShe explained: 'I've had morning sickness with all of them. With Flynn I had it, with Hart I had it, and now I have it again. Hopefully it will dissipate. 'It helps when I'm constantly snacking. I've just had a ginger apple shot. Ginger tea helps. Fresh ginger and hot water with a little honey and lemon.'\n\nMiranda and Evan, 29, tied the knot in May 2017.", "description": "The couple already have 17-month-old son, Hart, together.The Australian supermodel also has eight-year-old son Flynn with her ex-husband Orlando Bloom", "authors": ["Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/22/19760514-0-image-a-11_1571174877148.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
