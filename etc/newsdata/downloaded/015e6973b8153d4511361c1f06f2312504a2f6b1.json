Jonathan Schecter, of the fire department's [emergency medical services] Station 23, \"incessantly subjected Pivarnick to unwelcome sexual advances, as well as comments about her body and physical appearance,\u201d and inappropriate text messages, according to Page Six.\n\n'JERSEY SHORE' CAST MEMBER JENNI 'JWOWW' FARLEY ACCUSES ESTRANGED HUSBAND OF DOMESTIC ABUSE IN LENGTHY OPEN LETTER\n\nIn a 2017 text, Schecter allegedly wrote: \"Your a-- is amazing and I wish I wasn\u2019t working or in uniform because I definitely would\u2019ve kissed those amazing lips.\" In 2018, he allegedly grabbed her behind and \"made contact with her vaginal area\" in a parking lot outside the Rossville station.\n\nPivarnick claims she \"made it clear\" that Schecter was not allowed to touch her, but he allegedly sent her a text later that day that said: \"That a--! If you only knew the thoughts I had in my mind.\"\n\nSeparately, Lt. David Rudnitzky \u201capparently believed that he could speak to Pivarnick at work in sexually graphic and vulgar terms\u201d because she starred in new episodes of MTV's \"Jersey Shore.\"\n\nPITTSBURGH PIRATES CLOSER FOR FELIPE V\u00c1ZQUEZ ARRESTED FOR ALLEGED SOLICITATION OF CHILD\n\n\u201cHow many guys on \u2018Jersey Shore\u2019 have you f-----?,\u201d Rudnitzky allegedly asked in March 2018, according to the lawsuit.

She also alleged she was retaliated against for making the complaints.\n\nIn a statement to E!

Like all women, I am entitled to be treated with dignity and respect at work, and I should not have to accept unwanted sexual advances, crude comments about my body, or physical assault,\" she said. \"Going forward, at the instruction of my lawyers, I will not be commenting about this case further except as required in court.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the New York City Law Department said the case was under review.", "description": "\"Jersey Shore\" star Angelina Pivarnick claims she was sexually harassed by an FDNY supervisor while working as an EMT on Staten Island, N.Y.", "authors": ["Nicole Darrah", "Nicole Darrah Covers Breaking", "Trending News For Foxnews.Com.
