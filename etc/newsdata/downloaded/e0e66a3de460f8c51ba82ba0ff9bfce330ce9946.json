Ron Wyden\u2019s Capital-Gains Tax Plan Devotes Trillions to Social Security", "language": "en", "text": "WASHINGTON\u2014 Sen. Ron Wyden\u2019s proposal to restructure and increase capital-gains taxes would generate at least $1.5 trillion over a decade, dedicated to extending the solvency of Social Security, according to a more detailed plan the senator is releasing Thursday.\n\nMr. Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, wants to apply income taxes to the annual appreciation of assets, even if investors don\u2019t sell their holdings. For example, a stockholding worth $10 million on Jan. 1 and $15 million on Dec. 31 would add $5 million to the owner\u2019s income. That is a fundamental shift in U.S. tax rules, which now don\u2019t impose capital-gains taxes until an asset is sold.\n\nWith Republicans showing no interest in capital-gains tax increases, Mr. Wyden\u2019s proposal to go after the people he will label \u201ctax avoidance artists\u201d stands no chance of becoming law soon.\n\nRather, it is a marker for what Democrats might do in 2021 if they control the government, part of a set of ideas from progressive lawmakers, academics and presidential candidates aimed at raising taxes on the superrich.\n\nMr. Wyden outlined his proposal in April, and presidential candidate Juli\u00e1n Castro has endorsed the same idea.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Wyden offered additional details about how the tax would work, and he began seeking comments on technical questions.\n\nHe also linked the plan to shoring up Social Security, which is scheduled to need additional money to keep existing benefits starting in 2035. Currently, Social Security relies on revenue from payroll taxes, linking workers\u2019 contributions to benefits. Mr. Wyden would use money from wealthy investors to bolster the program.\n\nMr. Wyden\u2019s tax would apply only to individuals or married couples who have had at least $1 million in annual income or $10 million in assets for three consecutive years. When calculating that asset total, individuals could exclude the first $2 million of personal residences, the first $3 million of tax-preferred retirement accounts and the first $5 million of operating family farms.\n\nMr. Wyden would tax gains at ordinary-income tax rates, eliminating preferential rates for capital gains that have existed for decades. He doesn\u2019t specify a top rate.\n\nThe tax would also apply to built-up gains on existing assets, after a deduction for losses, potentially triggering significant tax bills for billionaires who built their fortunes over the past few decades. That would include the world\u2019s richest person, Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos, Mr. Wyden said in an interview Wednesday.\n\nLevies on past gains would be payable over a to-be-determined transition period, perhaps at discounted rates. So someone who bought $20 million of stock in 1990 that is now worth $50 million would face taxes on that $30 million gain. In that sense, Mr. Wyden\u2019s plan resembles a one-time wealth tax President Trump proposed in 1999.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What do you think of Mr. Wyden\u2019s proposal? Join the conversation below.\n\nMr. Wyden\u2019s plan contrasts with the annual wealth tax offered by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), a presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cMy first priority is to make sure that we collect the federal income tax that is owed before you start looking at new taxes,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is what this is all about.\u201d\n\nMr. Wyden\u2019s plan would hit harder on people with fast-growing assets, such as tech-company founders whose businesses are still gaining value. Ms. Warren\u2019s proposal would put a tougher burden on existing, more stable fortunes.\n\nEconomists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, who advised Ms. Warren, estimated that Facebook Inc. founder Mark Zuckerberg would have paid the equivalent of a 16% annual wealth tax since 2008 under a plan like Mr. Wyden\u2019s. Her wealth tax has a 3% top rate.\n\nUnder current law, taxpayers pay capital-gains taxes on the difference between their cost and their sales price. If they don\u2019t sell, that entire gain can get wiped out when they die because heirs owe capital-gains taxes only on any gains above the value on the date of death.\n\n\u201cYou can pretty much not pay at all for years and years and years,\u201d Mr. Wyden said.\n\nDemocrats have argued that this system delivers unjustified benefits to asset holders by letting some gains escape income taxation. More than half of capital-gains income goes to the top 0.1% of households.\n\nMr. Wyden\u2019s plan for what\u2019s known as mark-to-market taxation would upend those longstanding rules. He would tax people each year on their unrealized capital gains.\n\nThat concept raises challenges that Mr. Wyden\u2019s latest document attempts to address.\n\nFiguring out annual values is straightforward for stocks and other tradable assets but trickier for private businesses, collectibles and commercial real estate.\n\nMr. Wyden proposes to let holders of those illiquid, nontradable assets defer their tax bill until they sell assets or transfer them through gift or death. But they would face an additional charge designed to eliminate the benefit of deferral and the plan outlines options for calculating it.\n\nWrite to Richard Rubin at richard.rubin@wsj.com", "description": "The proposal would eliminate preferential rates and tax gains at ordinary-income tax rates.", "authors": ["Richard Rubin", "Richard.Rubin Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106422/social"}
