They offer active noise cancellation, a pass-through audio feature so you can easily hear what\u2019s happening around you, and customizable ear tips, all of which are improvements over the standard AirPods model.\n\nComparing Apple\u2019s two headphones against each other is fairly simple to do, but it gets a little bit more tricky if you\u2019re trying to pick between other brands. The Beats Powerbeats Pro have the same H1 wireless chip, which makes them just as easy to pair with an iPhone, and just as responsive to \u201cHey Siri\u201d hands-free commands, and those are usually $50 cheaper than the new AirPods Pro. Amazon\u2019s new Echo Buds offer active noise reduction (not quite the same as cancellation), but at nearly half the cost, they might be the best choice for you. Sony\u2019s WF-1000XM3s have excellent noise cancellation and charge via USB-C, though their case is rather hulking.\n\nThere are a lot of specs to sort through, from water resistance and general earbud size, to what sort of cable comes included with each set, and of course, price. We\u2019ve built a table with a handful of popular options to help make your buying decision a bit easier.\n\nAirPods Pro spec comparison Features Apple AirPods Pro Amazon Echo Buds Sony WF-1000XM3 Beats Powerbeats Pro AirPods (second-generation) Features Apple AirPods Pro Amazon Echo Buds Sony WF-1000XM3 Beats Powerbeats Pro AirPods (second-generation) Active noise canceling / reduction Yes Yes Yes No No Pass-through / transparency audio Yes Yes Yes No No Connectivity Bluetooth 5.0 Bluetooth 5.0 Bluetooth 5.0 Bluetooth 5.0 Bluetooth 5.0 Earbud size (mm) 30.9 x 21.8 x 24 22 x 23 x 24 Undisclosed 55 (width, depth undisclosed) 40.5 x 16.5 x 18 Case size (mm) 45.2 x 60.6 21.7 57 x 77 x 29 Undisclosed 77 (width, depth undisclosed) 53.5 x 44.3 x 21.3 Earbud weight (g) 5.4 7.6 8.5 about 10 4 Case weight (g) 45.6 70 79.3 Undisclosed 40 Battery (earbud) up to 4.5 hours up to five hours up to eight hours up to nine hours up to five hours Battery (case) more than 24 hours up to 20 hours up to 24 hours up to 24 hours more than 24 hours Water resistance certification IPX4 IPX4 N/A IPX4 N/A Wired charging Lightning connector Micro USB connector USB-C connector Lightning connector Lightning connector Wireless charging Qi-certified chargers No No No Yes (via optional Qi-ready case) Charging cord included Lightning to USB-C Micro USB to USB-A USB-C to USB-C Lightning to USB-A Lightning to USB-A Price $249 $129 $229 $249 $199 Custom chips Apple H1 Intel Dual Digital Signal Processor with Inference Engine HD Noise-Canceling Processor QN1e Apple H1 Apple H1", "description": "Apple\u2019s AirPods Pro promise better sound than regular AirPods, as well as noise cancellation.
