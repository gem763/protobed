On paper, the Flying Shark has marginally superior specifications compared to the FA-18E/F Super Hornets flown by the U.S. Navy.\n\nBut in practice, the J-15 still suffers from numerous flaws, particularly related to its engines. Four of the roughly fifty J-15s built have already been lost in accidents. Furthermore, the J-15 can only carry a very light payload when taking off from the curved deck of China\u2019s first two carriers.\n\nThough the catapults and larger flight decks on China\u2019s next four carriers should address this problem, the PLA Navy is apparently interested in a step change to operating a stealth fighter.\n\nStealth technology is by no means a perfect defense, but it allows for drastically greater survivability when facing enemy fighters and air defense systems which could launch missile attacks from dozens of miles away.\n\nFor China, those threats could come in the form of U.S. or Japanese fighters armed with long-range air-to-air missiles and warships armed with the powerful, multi-layered Aegis air-defense systems.\n\nBut which jet?\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "And they have choices.", "authors": ["Sebastien Roblin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/nwfDh9SizV9Q4Y4blwGV3A--~B/aD03OTQ7dz0xMzg3O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/b66a304ded89bee1e95cdddf1cdf08cf", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
