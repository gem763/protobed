I think it\u2019s a great dereliction of their democratic duties,\u201d he added.\n\nAn hour later, the House of Commons served Johnson a defeat on his backup plan: a bill to force an early national election on Oct. 15. Johnson said voters should get to choose whether he or Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn represents Britain at a Brexit-focused meeting of E.U. leaders on Oct. 17.\n\nAD\n\nJohnson needed two-thirds of the 650 members of the House of Commons to support his call for a general election, and he fell far short, with just 298 votes. The Labour Party\u2019s 247 lawmakers abstained from the vote.\n\n\u201cWe want an election so we look forward to turfing this government out,\u201d Corbyn said. But he called Johnson\u2019s election motion \u201ca cynical move by a cynical prime minister\u201d who is trying to sneak through a no-deal Brexit.\n\nAD\n\nBefore they would back an election, Corbyn and his lieutenants insisted on guaranteeing against an October no-deal Brexit with legislation approved by the House of Lords and signed into law.\n\nJohnson couldn\u2019t resist tweaking Corbyn after the vote: \u201cThe obvious conclusion I\u2019m afraid is he does not think he will win.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCorbyn is a far-left leader who is deeply unpopular among many Britons. But it is Johnson who is in a profoundly weak position \u2014 and risks falling into the same quagmire that cost his predecessor, Theresa May, her job.\n\nA defiant Johnson led his first \u201cPrime Minister\u2019s Questions\u201d session in Parliament on Wednesday and demanded, \u201cLet\u2019s get Brexit done.\u201d\n\nJohnson portrayed himself as a \u201csensible, moderate and Conservative\u201d leader who wanted to \u201cdeliver the mandate of the people\u201d by an Oct. 31 deadline, even if that meant a no-deal Brexit without agreements in place to regulate trade and other matters. He accused his opponents of \u201cdither, delay and confusion\u201d that would guarantee more years of debate and uncertainty about leaving the E.U. And he dismissed predictions of the economic harm of a no-deal Brexit as \u201cshameless scare\u00admongering.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJohnson claimed that neither he nor the British people want another general election, which would be the third in five years. But his position rang hollow to many observers. On Tuesday morning he had a slim working majority, by only one seat, in the House of Commons. By Wednesday, after defections and excommunications, he was 43 seats short of a working majority, making it nearly impossible for him to pass any legislation, even on non-Brexit bills.\n\nSo an election may be inevitable \u2014 although maybe not on Johnson\u2019s terms. And he seems to be pursuing a risky strategy.\n\nAmid Brexit crisis, House of Commons leader infuriates lawmakers with his body language\n\nJohnson has banned from his party the 21 rebels who voted against him on Tuesday. He seems to hope they will be replaced in the next election by candidates more loyal to him and his Brexit vision. But those banned lawmakers include some of the most respected figures in the party, including two former chancellors of the exchequer, or finance ministers: Kenneth Clarke and Philip Hammond.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere has to be an election, but Boris Johnson has damaged his own party in the run-up to an election,\u201d said Tonge, the professor.\n\nAlso banished, remarkably, was Nicholas Soames, 71, former prime minister Winston Chur\u00adchill\u2019s grandson, who has served in Parliament for 37 years. Johnson idolizes Churchill and wrote a biography of him.\n\nBafflement over that expulsion was summed up by Ruth Davidson, who stood down as the Conservatives\u2019 leader in Scotland last week.\n\n\u201cHow, in the name of all that is good and holy, is there no longer room in the Conservative Party\u201d for Soames, she tweeted, using the hashtag: #anofficerandagentleman.\n\nIn a debate ahead of a vote on the delay legislation, Soames, who is now an independent lawmaker, urged others to back the bill, which he said \u201cmerely seeks to avoid disaster of a no-deal Brexit.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe said that he believed that the result of the 2016 E.U. referendum had to be respected and pointed out that he backed May\u2019s deal on three occasions, \u201cwhich is more than can be said for the prime minister, the leader of the House and several members of the cabinet, whose serial disloyalty has been such an inspiration to so many of us.\u201d\n\nLawmaker blasts Boris Johnson in Parliament for \u2018racist\u2019 remarks about Muslim women\n\nThe bill passed in the House of Commons on Wednesday would require Johnson, by Oct. 19, to win parliamentary approval for a Brexit deal or a no-deal one, or to write to the E.U. seeking a three-month delay on Brexit. With E.U. agreement, the new Brexit date would be Jan. 31.\n\nIn effect, the bill would delay Brexit and forbid a no-deal one next month without Parliament\u2019s approval \u2014 which it will not give. It would give London three more months to negotiate Brexit terms, which it has been unable to do in the past.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor years, E.U. diplomats watched May negotiate positions with the organization, then fail to rally Parliament behind her. They briefly hoped Johnson might be more successful, but now they said they believe they were wrong.\n\nE.U. Brexit negotiators said they remain eager to see new proposals from Johnson\u2019s team. But they are bracing for the impact of a possible no-deal Brexit. They have set aside $858 million to help E.U. countries hurt by that circumstance, redirecting money intended to help victims of natural disasters and globalization.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real problem with Johnson, and it\u2019s a problem Theresa May didn\u2019t have,\u201d Keir Star\u00admer, Labour\u2019s Brexit negotiator, said on Sky News. \u201cPeople disagreed with Theresa May, but when she stood at the dispatch box and said something, she meant it and she was trusted.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cJohnson is not trusted. Even if he says the election will be on the 15th of October, most people in Parliament won\u2019t believe him. This is his central problem.\u201d\n\nAt least one person remains fully confident in Johnson. In the Oval Office on Wednesday, President Trump said: \u201cHe\u2019s a friend of mine, and he\u2019s going at it, there\u2019s no question about it. Boris knows how to win. Don\u2019t worry about him.\u201d\n\nJohnson won one victory Wednesday morning in one of several legal cases that have been filed over his decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks. A judge in Scotland\u2019s highest civil court ruled that the decision was lawful, but those who brought the case \u2014 75 lawmakers \u2014 could appeal. There are similar legal challenges in Northern Ireland and in England.\n\nMichael Birnbaum in Brussels and Laura Hughes in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nBritain may face snap elections after Prime Minister Boris Johnson suffers major loss in Parliament\n\nBoris Johnson\u2019s no-deal Brexit could lead British lambs to slaughter\n\nCould Boris Johnson\u2019s \u2018no-deal\u2019 Brexit break up the United Kingdom?\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "After only six weeks on the job, he is a weakened leader.", "authors": ["Kevin Sullivan", "Senior Correspondent Covering National", "International Affairs", "Karla Adam", "London Correspondent Covering The United Kingdom"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/UOpmv91E4qtiWxLyn9UUqOwBplw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AAR2TUWOWUI6TDA4PSHOPBNYKU.jpg"}
