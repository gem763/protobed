Bertelsman threw out Nicholas Sandmann's $250 million claim in July against the newspaper following its coverage of protests between two separate groups in the capital.\n\nThe teenager claimed he was falsely labeled a racist following the encounter with a Native American man at the Lincoln Memorial in January.\n\nDuring protests by anti-abortion demonstrators in a March for Life, attended by the Covington students, and the Indigenous Peoples March, Sandmann could be seen in a viral image coming face-to-face with Native American, Nathan Phillips.\n\nVideo of the encounter showed Sandmann and Phillips standing very close to each other, with Sandmann staring and at times smiling at Phillips as he sang and played a drum.\n\nA federal judge dismissed Covington Catholic student Nicholas Sandmann's $250million libel lawsuit against the Washington Post, stemming from an incident (pictured) which went viral\n\nSandmann's lawsuit claimed that the newspaper engaged in 'targeting and bullying' and modern 'McCarthyism' in its coverage of the January incident\n\nBoth Sandmann and Phillips say they were trying to defuse tensions rising among three groups marching on a day.\n\nAlthough Sandmann's suit was dismissed as it was ruled the Post's articles were protected by the First Amendment, his lawyers managed to get the case partially reopened yesterday by filing an amended complaint.\n\nThe move will now give Sandmann's legal team access to the Post's documents during a fresh discovery process.\n\nSandmann's attorneys also threatened legal action against The Associated Press and other news organizations, and filed multimillion dollar lawsuits against the networks CNN and NBC.\n\nLawyer Todd McMurtry said that the 'ruling bodes will [well] for the NBC and CNN cases, as well'.\n\nHe tweeted yesterday: 'This is a huge win. Now #NickSandmann will be able to start discovery and find out exactly what the reporters were thinking when they attacked Nicholas and the #CovingtonCatholic kids.'\n\nThe actions of Sandmann and his classmates during the January march were intensely debated after the video and photographs emerged of them wearing 'Make America Great Again' hats near Phillips as he played a drum.\n\nFootage later emerged showing that both groups had been targeted by separate protesters and that Phillips had approached the Catholic students to remonstrate with them.\n\nSandmann (center) is seen above appearing to square up to a Native American elder Nathan Phillips (in tan jacket) during a rally in Washington, DC\n\nThe eight boys listed anonymously as plaintiffs in the complaint, which was filed in Kentucky's Kenton County Circuit Court, claim the named defendants, who are all prominent figures on Twitter, falsely smeared them as bigots and damaged their lives and reputations in the process\n\nSandmann launched a defamation suit against the Post, which is owned by Amazon's Jeff Bezos in February, alleging it had engaged in 'targeting and bullying' and modern 'McCarthyism' in order to further an 'anti-Trump agenda'.\n\nPresident Donald Trump himself cheered the lawsuit, posting to Twitter that 'Covington student suing WAPO. Go get them Nick. Fake News!'\n\nBut Kentucky judge Bertelsman, dismissed the teen's lawsuit, ruling that the paper reported Phillips's opinions about what happened that day and that although they may have been 'erroneous' opinions published by the Post, they are protected by the First Amendment.\n\nA federal judge previously ruled Nicholas Sandmann's $250 million lawsuit against the Washington Post was meritless because the paper quoted Nathan Phillips (pictured) who gave his opinion on what happened that day\n\nBertelsman's 36-page judgement read: 'Few principles of law are as well-established as the rule that statements of opinion are not actionable in libel actions.'\n\nLess than a week after Bertelsman's ruling a fresh suit was filed in Kentucky's Kenton County Circuit Court accusing a host of news organizations, journalists and celebrities of defamation.\n\nDemocratic presidential hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren, New York Times White House correspondent Maggie Haberman and CNN correspondent Ana Navarro were among 12 defendants named in the separate suit, which seeks a maximum payout of $600,000 ($50,000 per defendant).\n\nActivist Shaun King, US Rep. Deb Haaland, comedian Kathy Griffin and historian Kevin M. Kruse were also named in the suit along with ABC News political analyst Matthew Dowd, Mother Jones Editor-in-Chief Clara Jefferey, Rewire Editor-in-Chief Jodi Jacobson, Kentucky entrepreneur Adam Edelen and former CNN correspondent Reza Aslan.\n\nVideo footage later revealed Sandmann had been approached by Phillips (right, file image)\n\nEight male students listed anonymously as plaintiffs in the complaint, claim the named defendants, who are all prominent figures on Twitter, falsely smeared them as bigots and damaged their lives and reputations.\n\nIn a letter to the AP in February, attorney L. Lin Wood called on the AP to 'retract and correct' what his letter asserts are 'defamatory statements'.\n\nA spokeswoman said at the time that the AP took great care to ensure its stories were measured and fair, reporting the facts of what transpired and adding details as they emerged.\n\nWood did not reply to an email message seeking comment on the ruling in July.\n\nFederal judge William O. Bertelsman ruled in July that the Washington Post's reporting was protected by the First Amendment. On Monday he partially reopened the case\n\nIn Sandmann's lawsuit against The Washington Post, his attorneys highlighted seven articles and three Twitter social media posts they considered defamatory to Sandmann.\n\n'The Post ignored basic journalist standards because it wanted to advance its well-known and easily documented, biased agenda against President Donald J. Trump ... by impugning individuals perceived to be supporters,' according to the complaint.\n\nThe lawsuit alleged that the newspaper had 'conveyed that [Sandmann] engaged in acts of racism by 'swarming' Phillips, 'blocking' his exit away from the students, and otherwise engaging in racist misconduct.'\n\nJudge Bertelsman said in the ruling that he accepted Sandmann's contention that 'when he was standing motionless in the confrontation with Phillips, his intent was to calm the situation...'\n\nBut he noted that Phillips asserted that he was being blocked from passing, and Phillips' opinion was reported by the newspaper.\n\n'They may have been erroneous ... but they are opinion protected by The First Amendment,' Bertelsman wrote.\n\nIn a statement to the Washington Post not long after the ruling, Sandmann's parents indicated their intention to appeal.\n\n'I believe fighting for justice for my son and family is of vital national importance,' Ted Sandmann said in a statement. 'If what was done to Nicholas is not legally actionable, then no one is safe.'", "description": "Judge William O.
