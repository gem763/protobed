We are going to take measures to protect our borders and we are going to be much stricter, much faster in applying them.\u201d\n\nDozens dead, including children, after migrant boat capsizes in Aegean Sea Read more\n\nHe added that the Greek government would also appeal to Nato and the EU to help step up patrols in the area.\n\nThe sharp increase in migrant and refugee arrivals appears to have taken officials by surprise. Last week close to 650 people, including 240 children mostly of Afghan origin, landed in a matter of hours on Lesbos, the north Aegean island on the frontline of the refugee crisis four years ago.\n\nA crackdown on migrants in Turkey, home to more than 3.6 million displaced Syrians, and renewed fighting in Syria appear to have spurred the jump. In August, Turkish authorities reported a sevenfold increase in those making the crossing into Greece. Nearly half of the 56,000 refugee and migrant arrivals in Europe this year have come through the Greek islands, according to the UN.\n\nNGOs describe camps on the islands as stretched to breaking point with men, women and children forced to live in squalid conditions. Almost 11,000 people are currently crammed into Moria, the main refugee settlement on Lesbos, originally designed to host 3,000 at most.\n\nAfter an Afghan teenager was killed during a fight in the camp last week, Unicef raised the alarm and said over 1,100 unaccompanied children were forced to endure \u201cdangerous and overcrowded\u201d conditions in facilities across Greece.\n\nNot since March 2016, when the EU struck a controversial deal with Turkey to stem the flows, has Greece witnessed such a surge in numbers.\n\nOn Friday the Greek foreign minister, Nikos Dendias, summoned the Turkish ambassador in protest.\n\nOn Monday the government, which assumed power barely two months ago, will begin moving refugees to reception centres on the mainland in an effort to decongest island camps. According to Chrysochoidis around 1,500 will be moved, mostly from Samos and Lesbos. Around 100 unaccompanied minors will also be transferred with a view to joining families in other EU member states.\n\n\u201cWe will also start sending illegal migrants back to Turkey which, after all, is considered a safe country,\u201d Chrysochoidis said. \u201cOf the 80,000 people presently in Greece half should have been sent back already as they do not have the right documents or fulfil the conditions of asylum seekers. Instead only 1,800 have been readmitted to Turkey.\u201d\n\nBut human rights groups have voiced concerns. With the new government also vowing to abolish appeals to asylum rejections, there are fears of violations as the emergency measures aiming to bring down migrant arrival numbers are enforced.\n\nStill, Chrysochoidis claimed that under Syriza, the former leftist government, a particularly \u201clax approach\u201d had been taken to asylum procedures that needed to be addressed.\n\n\u201cIn the absence of enough state doctors on islands, private doctors would hand out papers categorising everyone as vulnerable which has contributed greatly to Greece becoming such an attractive destination for smugglers,\u201d he said.\n\nChrysochoidis, brought in by Greece\u2019s prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, to assume a post he first held two decades ago, has attempted to allay fears that authorities were poised to mount a massive crackdown on migrants by saying the government\u2019s aim was to integrate refugees fully. \u201cWe don\u2019t want ghetto camps. Asylum seekers will enjoy all their rights under international law in Greece.\u201d", "description": "Human rights groups voice concerns over measures announced amid fears of migrant crisis re-escalation", "authors": ["Helena Smith"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7187070c3ce5e0edd8a74f8e4cc7b0ca1971b5e2/0_266_4800_2879/master/4800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=49f45cda299c60ff1ae33973b5e8baca"}
