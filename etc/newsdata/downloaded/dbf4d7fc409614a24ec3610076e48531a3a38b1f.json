Residents last week said they pooled their funds to keep drug users from having a space to shoot up as they camp out overnight.\n\nThe department\u2019s director, Mohammed Nuru, told the San Francisco Examiner that the boulders installed by the residents \u201cwere not big enough\u201d and began posing a safety concern as they were being pushed into the street. He said the city would work with residents to come up with a more permanent solution that \u201ccould involve larger boulders or a landscape plan.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey would have saved a lot of money and a lot of trouble if they just said something to us,\u201d Daniel Bartosiewicz, a homeless man who said he\u2019s camped in Clinton Park for the past two months, told the Bay Area\u2019s KNTV. \u201cUse your compassion and love and understanding. We\u2019re humans.\u201d\n\nThe San Francisco Coalition on Homelessness reacted to the city\u2019s decision to remove the Clinton Park boulders, writing: \u201cThey should remove all the anti-homeless design and hostile architecture from the rest of the city while they're at it \u2014 most of which are *City-sanctioned.*\u201d\n\nThe city and state have implemented similar landscaping choices in an effort to deter homeless encampments in other neighborhoods. The California Department of Transportation has put rocks in an open space off Bayshore Boulevard to deter encampments, while the Eureka Valley-Harvey Milk Branch of the San Francisco Public Library \u2013 in the same neighborhood \u2013 has made design choices that are perceived as anti-homeless, according to KTVU.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nSan Francisco has long struggled with problems of human waste and needles on the streets of the Tenderloin district, where many addicts and homeless people are typically found. The city has set up public toilets and last year announced the creation of a special six-person \"poop patrol\" team to clean up the human waste.\n\nFox News' Travis Fedschun contributed to this report.", "description": "The city of San Francisco on Monday removed about two dozen small boulders from a residential side street after a group of neighbors had the structures installed last week in an effort to deter homeless people from camping out on along the sidewalk amid the city's ongoing crisis.", "authors": ["Danielle Wallace"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/boulders-clinton-park.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
