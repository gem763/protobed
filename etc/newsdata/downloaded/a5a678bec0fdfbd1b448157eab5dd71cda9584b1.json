By this afternoon, the Federalist\u2019s Mollie Hemingway had identified another significant error which appears in the book. Specifically, the book claims that Deborah Ramirez\u2019 allegations were met with silence by the people who she claimed were witnesses to the incident:\n\nThe claims of Deborah Ramirez, while not proven by witnesses, also ring true to us. Ramirez, who was a Yale classmate of Kavanaugh\u2019s, said he drunkenly thrust his penis at her during a party in their freshman-year dormitory, Lawrance Hall. The people who allegedly witnessed the event\u2014Kavanaugh\u2019s friends Kevin Genda, David Todd, and David White\u2014have kept mum about it. Kavanaugh has denied it. If such an incident had occurred, Kavanaugh said, it would have been the \u201ctalk of campus.\u201d\n\nBut as Hemingway points out, it\u2019s just not true that the alleged witnesses kept mum. In fact, several people Ramirez identified as having been present or involved in the incident were anonymously quoted in the New Yorker article that broke the Ramirez allegations:\n\nOne of the male classmates who Ramirez said egged on Kavanaugh denied any memory of the party. \u201cI don\u2019t think Brett would flash himself to Debbie, or anyone, for that matter,\u201d he said. Asked why he thought Ramirez was making the allegation, he responded, \u201cI have no idea.\u201d The other male classmate who Ramirez said was involved in the incident commented, \u201cI have zero recollection.\u201d In a statement, two of those male classmates who Ramirez alleged were involved in the incident, the wife of a third male student she said was involved, and one other classmate, Dan Murphy, disputed Ramirez\u2019s account of events: \u201cWe were the people closest to Brett Kavanaugh during his first year at Yale. He was a roommate to some of us, and we spent a great deal of time with him, including in the dorm where this incident allegedly took place. Some of us were also friends with Debbie Ramirez during and after her time at Yale. We can say with confidence that if the incident Debbie alleges ever occurred, we would have seen or heard about it\u2014and we did not. The behavior she describes would be completely out of character for Brett. In addition, some of us knew Debbie long after Yale, and she never described this incident until Brett\u2019s Supreme Court nomination was pending. Editors from the New Yorker contacted some of us because we are the people who would know the truth, and we told them that we never saw or heard about this.\u201d\n\nSince the names aren\u2019t included in the original New Yorker piece, I guess it\u2019s possible some of Kavanaugh\u2019s friends have remained quiet but it seems significant that several did not. As Mollie Hemingway concludes, \u201cPogrebin and Kelly\u2019s work has a pattern of omitting exculpatory evidence that supports Kavanaugh\u2019s consistent claim that he never sexually assaulted anyone.\u201d\n\nThere really does seem to be a pattern here. During their appearance on the View today Pogrebin and Kelly admitted some responsibility for failing to ensure an allegation about Kavanaugh included the key detail that the woman involved says she doesn\u2019t remember it. They also admitted to leaving out of their piece the fact that the alleged eyewitness to that incident once worked as an attorney for Bill Clinton. I also have some doubts about other statements that appeared in the Atlantic excerpt. For instance, this bit about Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s honesty:\n\nWe have seen no evidence of Ford fabricating stories, either recently or historically. Multiple people attest to her honesty. Last August, she passed a polygraph test focused on her Kavanaugh memories. Her former boyfriend Brian Merrick said in a sworn affidavit to the Senate Judiciary Committee that he hadn\u2019t known of her fear of flying or of tight spaces when they dated in the 1990s, raising questions for Republicans about the anxiety issues Ford has attributed in part to the alleged assault.\n\nThis fear of flying thing was hashed over last year. Despite her alleged fear of flying that prompted claims she would drive across country to testify, Dr. Ford flew in for the hearing. And under oath, she admitted to flying around the world on vacations. Similarly, there were stories about Ford installing a second door in her home so she would always have an escape route if she ever felt trapped. This was allegedly a lasting impact from the incident with Kavanaugh. But an investigation revealed the 2nd door in Ford\u2019s home was installed so a marriage counselor could run her business out of the front of the house. That doesn\u2019t prove that Ford routinely fabricated stories but she certainly seems to have embellished a few when it suited her purpose to do so. There\u2019s also this from the book excerpt:\n\nUsing Martha\u2019s common-sense standard, we can see no reason Ford would have come forward with her account if she didn\u2019t believe it. Ford has led a quiet life for many years. She has no love of the spotlight, and she pleaded with lawmakers and The Washington Post for weeks to preserve her privacy.\n\nBut Ford\u2019s own attorney recently suggested a political motive for her coming forward. \u201cWhen he takes a scalpel to Roe v. Wade, we will know who he is, we know his character, and we know what motivates him, and that is important; it is important that we know, and that is part of what motivated Christine,\u201d Deborah Katz said.\n\nWhen you add to this the fact that Ford\u2019s best friend and her own father apparently don\u2019t really believe her story, it seems fair to suggest Martha\u2019s common-sense might standard migh suggest an alternative view of Dr. Ford\u2019s allegations against Brett Kavanaugh.", "description": "\"...if the incident Debbie alleges ever occurred, we would have seen or heard about it\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/View-authors.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
