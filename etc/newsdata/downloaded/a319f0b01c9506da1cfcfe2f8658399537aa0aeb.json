Unless you\u2019re a packing genius who knows all of the tricks \u2014 like using packing cubes for better travel and snagging a best-selling travel wallet to stay organized \u2014 packing really, really sucks for most of us.\n\nPacking, obviously, starts with a good suitcase. Use one with not enough pockets or storage, and you spend a portion of your trip sorting and shuffling through your suitcase trying to find exactly what you need. Use one with too many pockets and add-on feature, and there\u2019s not enough space for the stuff you actually need.\n\nThat said, Instagram\u2019s favorite luggage is Away suitcases \u2014 but is Away luggage actually worth its more than $200 price tag? Some folks think so, but if you\u2019re traveling on budget, chances are you\u2019re looking for a cheaper alternative to Away luggage. That\u2019s where the Genius Pack comes in, ensuring all of your travel gear is in the right place, without draining your bank account.\n\nThe Genius Pack Aerial Hardside Carry On Spinner includes spaces for practically everything you need on your adventures, including chargers, pockets for socks and delicates, and even a space for dirty clothes. There\u2019s even an integrated packing checklist, so you\u2019ll barely even have to think while you fold and stow.\n\nThe Aerial is the maximum regulation-sized carry-on bag, but it\u2019s feather-light at just 6.2 pounds. It also packs 360-degree spinner wheels, so you can zip through the airport with zero struggle. Best of all, though, this minimalist suitcase is way cheaper than an Away luggage, with all the feature of the internet\u2019s favorite carry-on.\n\nIt usually retails for about $300, but you can get it on sale now for just $159 in four Away-worth shades, from sleek black, matte white, brushed chrome or hunter green.\n\nGenius Pack Aerial Hardside Carry On Spinner (Matte White) - $159\n\n\n\nSee Deal", "description": "Buy real stuff from the HuffPost store: All purchases support our journalism.", "authors": ["Huffpost Finds Partner"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7137e62500001c13051352.png?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
