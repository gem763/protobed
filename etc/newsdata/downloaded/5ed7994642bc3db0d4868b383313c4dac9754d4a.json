REUTERS/Ammar Awad\n\nThe rallying cry of the protesters, who have trashed public buildings in the Chinese-ruled city, set street fires and thrown petrol bombs at police, has been \u201cfive demands, not one less\u201d, meaning the withdrawal of the bill make no difference.\n\nHong Kong leader Carrie Lam had said many times the bill was as good as dead and said that other demands, including universal suffrage and an amnesty for all those charged with rioting, were beyond her control.\n\nProtesters are also calling for her to stand down and for an independent inquiry into perceived police brutality during a long hot summer of running battles on the streets.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t any big differences between suspension and withdrawal (of the extradition bill)... It\u2019s too little, too late,\u201d said 27-year-old protester Connie, hours before the bill was withdrawn. \u201cThere are still other demands the government needs to meet, especially the problem of police brutality.\u201d\n\nMost protesters do not give their full name to avoid being identified.\n\nPolice have responded to the violence with water cannon, tear gas, rubber bullets and several live rounds.\n\nProtesters are angry at what they see as Beijing encroaching on the former British colony\u2019s \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula enshrined during the handover in 1997, which permits the city wide-ranging freedoms not available on the mainland such as an independent judiciary.\n\nThe extradition bill would have allowed defendants charged with serious crimes to be sent for trial abroad, including to Communist Party-controlled courts in China.\n\nThe bill was seen as the latest move by Beijing to erode those freedoms. China has denied these claims and accuses foreign countries of fomenting trouble.\n\nA murder suspect whose case Lam had originally held up as showing the need for the extradition bill walked free on Wednesday as the city\u2019s government squabbled with Taiwan over how to handle his potential voluntary surrender to authorities.\n\n\u201cNO SUCH THING\u201d\n\nChan Tong-kai, a Hong Kong citizen, was accused of murdering his girlfriend in Taiwan last year before fleeing back to the financial hub. Chan was arrested by Hong Kong police in March 2018 and authorities there were only able to find evidence against him for money laundering, for which he was sentenced to 29 months in prison.\n\nRelated Coverage China foreign ministry says report on plans to replace Hong Kong leader Lam a political rumor\n\nChan has offered to voluntarily surrender himself to Taiwan, but both Hong Kong and Taiwan have clashed over the next steps.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as surrender,\u201d Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen told reporters. \u201cThere\u2019s only arrest... We will continue to ask for legal assistance from the Hong Kong government, including providing related evidence and to ask the Hong Kong government not to evade the matter.\u201d\n\nHong Kong Secretary for Security John Lee said Taiwan, which China claims as its own, was obstructing the case.\n\nChina, which views Taiwan as a renegade province, has offered the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula for it to unite with the mainland. Fiercely democratic Taiwan has rejected the offer with Tsai saying this month such an arrangement had set Hong Kong \u201con the edge of disorder\u201d.\n\nChina, which has many times expressed confidence in Lam and her government to end the unrest, was drawing up a plan to replace her with an \u201cinterim\u201d chief executive, the Financial Times reported, citing people briefed on the deliberations.\n\nLam has become a lightning rod for protests and another of the protesters\u2019 demands has been for her to stand down.\n\nThe leading candidates to succeed Lam include Norman Chan, the former head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, and Henry Tang, who has also served as the territory\u2019s financial secretary and chief secretary for administration, the report said.\n\nA spokesman said Tang did not comment on speculation and that he supported Lam as chief executive.\n\nA senior official in Beijing said the FT story was wrong and none of the suggested candidates listed in the story could possibly take over from Lam based on the Basic Law, Hong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution which came into force in 1997.\n\nBut Beijing had prepared all kinds of contingency plans for different scenarios in Hong Kong, including Lam\u2019s administration losing total control of the situation, the official said.\n\nChina\u2019s foreign ministry said the FT report was political rumor with ulterior motives.\n\nOver recent months, Beijing has set up a special team working from Shenzhen, just across the border from Hong Kong, to gather information and it acts as the major communication channel between Hong Kong and Beijing, according to two people familiar with the situation.\n\nLam\u2019s office was authorized to talk to the team directly without going through Beijing\u2019s Liaison Office in Hong Kong, one of the people said.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nThe Liaison Office, the symbol of Chinese rule, was attacked and daubed with anti-China graffiti in July.\n\nIn September, in response to a Reuters report about a recording of Lam saying she would step down if she could, she said she had never asked the Chinese government to let her resign.", "description": "Hong Kong's legislature on Wednesday formally withdrew planned legislation that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, but the move was unlikely to end months of unrest as it met just one of five demands of pro-democracy protesters.", "authors": ["Jessie Pang", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444021627&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M0HT", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
