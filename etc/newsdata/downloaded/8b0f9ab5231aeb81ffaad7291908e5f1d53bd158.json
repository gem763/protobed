Probably one of the most appalling nights I have seen.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\n\"I had a chat with Gareth at half-time, asked him if the team was OK. He said he was OK, he said the team was OK and the second half went ahead on that basis.\n\n\"Gareth at the end, I spoke to him, and he felt they made the right decision to finish the game, and the squad wanted to finish the game.\"\n\nClarke has now called on UEFA to make a strong statement following previous criticism of the organisation for not doing enough to try to end racism in football, as well as continuing to try to tackle the matter in England.\n\nHe added: \"I would like to see a very stringent review by UEFA, because I know they take racism very, very seriously.\n\n\"If we say we have zero tolerance to racism, to me one person making monkey chanting noises is the same as a hundred. Zero tolerance is zero tolerance.\n\n(Image: X03807)\n\n\"I think at UEFA we need to really address that, but to be perfectly frank we also still need to address racism in England.\n\n\"We still have it, we have it throughout the pyramid, we see examples of it every week from the professional game down to the grassroots game.\n\n\"We shouldn't take the moral high ground, we should join a movement to drive racism out of our game and have zero tolerance for it.\"", "description": "The Three Lions' 6-0 win was completely overshadowed by the actions of Bulgaria fans after they targeted England's black players", "authors": ["Alex Milne", "Image", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20580566.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Racism-in-Bulgaria-vs-England-game.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
