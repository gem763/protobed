Their conversation could not be heard, but Keenum\u2019s body language made the tone of their dialogue obvious. Keenum was seen walking away as Gruden talks \u2014 before abruptly turning around. Moments later, Keenum shakes his head and walks away.\n\nKeenum was benched in Sunday\u2019s 24-3 loss to the New York Giants \u2014 a move that caught him by surprise, he told reporters.\n\nGruden turned to Dwayne Haskins in the second quarter.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not thinking about what\u2019s behind me,\u201d Keenum said when asked why he was surprised. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m thinking about moving forward and the next play and trying to get something going. I\u2019m not sitting there thinking about if I\u2019m going to get taken out of the game.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought Dwayne might give us a spark there at the end of the half,\u201d Gruden said.\n\nKeenum was largely ineffective for the second straight week. To open the game, he badly missed a wide-open Trey Quinn down the field. He then threw an interception on third down.\n\nGruden said Keenum missed throws he usually makes. Against the Giants, the 31-year-old was just 6 of 11 for 54 yards. He now has four interceptions on the season, throwing three last week against the Chicago Bears.\n\nGruden floated the idea of Keenum being bothered by a foot injury. On Wednesday, the quarterback was in a walking boot and missed practice. However, he returned a day later and was a full participant for the rest of the week.\n\nKeenum refused to use it as an excuse.\n\n\u201cEverybody plays hurt in this league,\u201d Keenum said. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the deal. I have to be better, hands-down. It doesn\u2019t matter what I\u2019m feeling, I have to be better for this team. I missed a few shots and turned the ball over again early. It cost us the momentum early, for sure.\u201d\n\nThe Redskins managed only one first down with Keenum in four series.\n\nHaskins wasn\u2019t much better. He finished the afternoon completing nearly 53% of his passes (9 of 17) for 107 yards, while tossing three interceptions. Washington\u2019s offense couldn\u2019t capitalize on the four turnovers the Redskins\u2019 defense generated.\n\nDespite the switch, Gruden did not commit to Haskins starting next week against the New England Patriots.\n\nKeenum said he\u2019d learn from the benching.\n\n\u201cI think we are all frustrated in this locker room; we all have to play better,\u201d Keenum said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough league. Every week. Everybody is really good and you can\u2019t do what we did on third down, have penalties, turn the ball over and expect to win. It just is what is.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
