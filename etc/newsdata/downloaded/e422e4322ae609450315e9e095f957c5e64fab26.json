I hate the fact he was alone, that I was not there to hold or comfort him, tend to his wounds or tell him I loved him and that all would be okay. No, he died alone with no-one around him.\u201d\n\nDescribing her husband as her \u201cbest friend and soulmate\u201d, she said: \u201cHe was kind, generous, hardworking, humorous and loving \u2026 I will never get over losing Ravi.\u201d\n\nSpeaking after the case, Detective Chief Inspector Simon Stancombe said: \u201dMr Katharkamar and Gunn couldn't be more different. Ravi was a warm and loving father and husband. A man who worked long hours to support his young family and run his shop in the heart of the local community in Pinner.\n\n\"Gunn, on the other hand, is a career criminal who has spent much of his adult life preying on other people. He is an odious, vile and dangerous individual who I am pleased to say will now be in prison for a very long time.\u201d\n\nDevi Kharran, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: \u201cThis case has had a real impact on the local community - particularly those who knew Mr Katharkamar and were regular customers to his shop. I hope today's conviction provides the family and friends of Mr Katharkamar with some degree of comfort.\u201c\n\nGunn had denied murder in the face of overwhelming evidence, but was found guilty of a string of offences. He was also convicted of four counts of burglary, two of theft from a motor vehicle, robbery, two counts of knife possession spanning from 5 to 29 March.", "description": "A \u201cone-man\u00a0crimewave\u201d has been\u00a0convicted of murdering a London shopkeeper for just \u00a3100.", "authors": ["Lizzie Dearden"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/08/19/alex-gunn1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
