I was once wearing overalls when I got some good job news, and so now I wear those overalls to all business meetings. If something major happens to you while wearing a certain outfit, the outfit is imbued with the vibe of that thing. This isn\u2019t science, but it\u2019s true. So on days I know something Major is happening, I try to dress accordingly. But \u201cmajor\u201d can also be bad, so if you have advance notice, a little preparation is worth it.\n\nA few weeks ago, I was getting dressed in clothes I knew I\u2019d be wearing when my boyfriend and I broke up that evening. We\u2019d had that pre-conversation that always either leads to two people mistakenly staying together, or respectfully calling it quits. This is an impossible thing to dress for, like finagling the proper outfit for a day that starts out 90 degrees and sunny and ends 55 and rainy. It\u2019s so widely known to be ridiculous that it\u2019s literally mocked in the trailer for the iconic breakup film, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, where an incidentally naked Jason Segel quips, \u201cWould you like to pick out the outfit that you break up with me in?\u201d\n\nI did several outfit changes that morning. At first, I thought, I should look great, that will make me feel more confident and less sad. People will generally agree with this logic; on bad days, dress in a way that makes you feel good. So I put on one of my roommate\u2019s blouses but it was obscenely cleavagey, which somehow felt wrong. Neither party should be thinking about your tits during a breakup. I tried a plain dress, but it\u2019s a dress I like to wear to work and I didn\u2019t want to curse a favorite outfit. A few changes in, I landed on the answer for us all, an outfit so nondescript, so basic, that I\u2019d forget about it entirely: A black T-shirt and jeans.\n\nI have a lot of black T-shirts and also a lot of jeans. This is exactly the point: A breakup outfit should be something nondescript and nearly interchangeable with most of the rest of your closet, a set of clothes you never think about again. It has to be something you won\u2019t see hanging in your closet and think, Fuck, that day fucking sucked. What a waste to never be able to wear your favorite top again, just because it was what you wore when you dumped your partner. Your clothes don\u2019t deserve that, they only deserve to be washed according to their instructions, and worn with some regularity. They certainly don\u2019t deserve to be donated, their curse passed on to some unassuming thrift shopper, because you couldn\u2019t handle looking at them anymore (sorry to my prior breakup outfits).\n\nTo Steve Jobs, the Rock, or in certain cases Elizabeth Holmes, the black shirt and jeans is a \u201cpower outfit.\u201d It works in this context because it requires very little thought, which is exactly the sort of outfit vibe you need on the day of breakup, when you\u2019re emotionally distressed and can\u2019t be bothered to think about pattern clashing. It\u2019s comfortable; it\u2019s not too schlubby; it\u2019s so unassuming that your soon-to-be-ex won\u2019t notice or remember it; and, as my coworker Katie Way pointed out, it\u2019s the people\u2019s outfit. Everyone owns these two pieces of clothing.\n\nEven now, less than a month later, I can\u2019t remember which exact combo of these items I wore that day. It could\u2019ve been any one of my stupid black shirts\u2014I\u2019ve got tons! Many might encourage a flashier look, one that shows your ex what they\u2019ll be missing, but I\u2019m here to say: Don\u2019t do that. It\u2019s kinda mean, for one. And it\u2019ll only leave you with a trail of amazing, unwearable, emotionally wrecked outfits that, unless you\u2019re megarich, you can\u2019t afford to replace. Avoid that problem by using this trick of\u2014when you can feel a bad day coming\u2014wearing an outfit so blas\u00e9 that you literally can\u2019t remember it weeks later. You\u2019ll be sad enough without having to take a moment to hold your freshly cursed blouse up between your fingers, sigh at it, and cry. This is self-care, I think? You deserve it.", "description": "Avoid cursing good clothes by wearing something absolutely forgettable.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5da0a5bc05193d0009ba607b/lede/1570809446522-10_10_2019_THE_PERFECT_BREAKUP_OUTFIT_IS_A_BLACK_SHIRT_AND_JEANS_CV.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
