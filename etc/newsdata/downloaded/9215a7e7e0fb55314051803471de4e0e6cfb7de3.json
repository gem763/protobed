However there is some speculation the Chinese government may wish to hold off negotiations until closer to the November 2020 US presidential election, when the political landscape becomes clearer.\n\n\u201cOur agreements are based on science surrounding the giant pandas,\u201d Pamela Baker-Masson, a spokeswoman for the zoo, told the Washington Post. \u201cWe\u2019ve accomplished a lot over the last 40-plus years. Now both sides have to take a look at what the future science goals should be, and they go from there.\u201d\n\nChina sent Mei Xiang and Tian Tian in 2000 on a 10-year, $10 million lease to the zoo, the lease was renegotiated in 2011 for five years at a cost of $500,000 a year. Another agreement was struck in 2015 to extend the lease until the end of 2020.\n\nTo add to the tension around the panda's fate, the zoo is currently waiting on tenter hooks to establish whether Mei Xiang is pregnant. The panda's behaviour has changed in the last month, suggesting she may be pregnant, but she has had several false pregnancies in recent years.", "description": "Washington's National Zoo may be left without any giant pandas\u00a0amid fears Donald Trump's ongoing trade war with China could see the bears become a political tool.\u00a0 The Smithsonian National Zoo\u2019s panda bears are one of the main draws for its two million annual visitors but the current lease of", "authors": ["Rozina Sabur"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1p7YGn5JAEUq8gqkOAx11w--~B/aD0xMTMyO3c9MTgwOTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_258/8493f8db0c3943b6f3809e20c3178ceb"}
