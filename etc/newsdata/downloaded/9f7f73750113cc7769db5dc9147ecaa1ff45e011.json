REUTERS/Guillaume Souvant\n\nThe company built its position as the world\u2019s biggest insulin maker on the back of injectable drugs, but now aims to transform the market with a first-of-its-kind tablet version of its semaglutide drug.\n\nWhile more than 70% of diabetes prescriptions in the United States are already for oral treatments, none of these are from the GLP-1 class that Novo specializes in, and which are viewed as highly effective medicines that stimulate insulin production.\n\n\u201cWe have only worked with around 25% of the patients so far and we see it as a breakthrough because we can now also address the tablet-based market,\u201d chief scientific officer Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen told Reuters on Monday.\n\nInvestors have been concerned the once-daily pill, known as Rybelsus, would be sold more cheaply than comparable injectable treatments as Novo tries to secure a foothold in the tablet market, where drugs tend to be cheaper.\n\nHowever, chief financial officer Karsten Munk Knudsen told analysts the monthly price would be similar to the company\u2019s once-weekly injectable version of semaglutide, Ozempic, which has a list price of nearly $800 per month.\n\n\u201cOverall this removes a concern that the company would have been forced much lower on price,\u201d said Bernstein analyst Wimal Kapadia, who has an \u2018outperform\u2019 rating on Novo shares.\n\nCompetitors include Eli Lilly\u2019s (LLY.N) injectable Trulicity and Merck\u2019s (MRK.N) Januvia, an oral medication known chemically as sitagliptin. A study last year showed Novo\u2019s tablet was superior to Januvia in demonstrating reductions in both long-term blood sugar level and weight.\n\n\u201cWe have a very strong position if you look at the leading tablet treatments in the market,\u201d Thomsen said.\n\nNovo hopes to convince doctors that Rybelsus, which brokerage Pareto estimates will have sales of at least 36.6 billion Danish crowns ($5.4 billion) in 2026, provides a new weapon to tackle diabetes earlier, and highly effectively.\n\nThomsen said the U.S. approval was a triumph of perseverance. \u201cWe were laughed at when we told our peers about it. They thought we had eaten or smoked something weird,\u201d he said of the early plans for the drug.\n\nThe name Rybelsus was picked because of its similarity to the word rebellious. \u201cThere is a revolt against why biological drugs should always be treated through injections,\u201d said Thomsen.", "description": "Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk is aiming for a big slice of the multibillion-dollar diabetes market with a new pill, approved by U.S. authorities on Friday, that caters for patients with an aversion to needles.", "authors": ["Stine Jacobsen", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432929559&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M0UN", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
