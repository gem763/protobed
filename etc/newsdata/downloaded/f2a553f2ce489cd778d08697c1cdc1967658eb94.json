Within three months, on 2 April, Richard Kehoe was discovered comatose in a tent opposite the Royal Liverpool hospital. Soon after, he was pronounced dead.\n\nThree days later, Liverpool\u2019s mayor, Joe Anderson, announced he would remove all tents from Liverpool city centre. \u201cWe are going to give people a warning, give them an hour to take their tent down and say: \u2018Here is a place for you to sleep, we will pick you up, take you with your goods.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt was a dramatic \u2013 possibly draconian \u2013 statement. Anderson called the policy tough love, and said there was no other option. He was not prepared to have homeless people dying on his streets, hidden in tents. \u201cWhen Richard Kehoe or Aimee Teese die, then we have all failed,\u201d he said.\n\nQ&A What is \"The empty doorway\" - the Guardian's series on people who died homeless? Show Hide An estimated 800 homeless people died in Britain in the 18 months before March 2019. Over the next few months, G2 and Guardian Cities will look behind this statistic to tell the stories of some of those who have died on Britain\u2019s streets. We will tell not just the story of their death, but the story of their life \u2013 what they were like as kids, what their dreams were, their hobbies, what people loved about them, what was infuriating. We will also examine what went wrong with their lives, how it impacted on their loved ones, and if anything could have been done differently to prevent their deaths. As the series develops, we will invite politicians, charities and homelessness organisations to respond to the issues raised. We will also ask readers to offer their own stories and reflections on homelessness. We want the stories we tell to become the fulcrum of a debate about homelessness; to make a difference to a scourge that shames us all. It is time to stop just passing by.\n\nIn Britain today, there are tents everywhere \u2013 city centres, railway stations, parks and towpaths. They have come to signify our fractured society. This is the seventh-wealthiest country in the world, where the disparity between rich and poor continues to grow, and where, according to Shelter, 320,000 people are homeless (roughly one in 200 of the population). Last year, it was reported by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism that at least 449 people had died in the UK while homeless in the 12 months up to October 2018.\n\nWe meet Aimee\u2019s aunt, Cathy Teese, in a tapas bar in Liverpool. A 45-year-old special-needs teacher, Cathy\u2019s youthfulness belies the tough life she has led. Her drug-addicted father killed himself by setting fire to the family home when she was 11 (thankfully, there was no one else in the house), and her mother was left to bring up four children alone: Stephen, Aimee\u2019s father John, Paul and Cathy.\n\nShe didn\u2019t set out to hurt people. You wouldn\u2019t have met her and gone: \u2018She\u2019s a pain in the arse.\u2019 You\u2019d say: \u2018Isn\u2019t she a cracking girl?\u2019 Cathy Teese\n\n\u201cLosing our dad hit the four of us in different ways,\u201d she says. \u201cThe older two went to drugs, and me and Paul never touched drugs. I\u2019m too scared of them. I\u2019ve seen too much. I\u2019ve instilled that into my girls as well.\u201d\n\nCathy\u2019s oldest brother, Stephen, died when he was 35. Aimee\u2019s mother, Jackie, who was also dependent on drugs, died aged 29 and was buried alongside Aimee\u2019s brother, Mikey, who died when he was 14 months old.\n\nWe're telling the stories of those who died homeless \u2013 here's why Read more\n\nCathy apologises for rattling off these tragedies. \u201cI must seem heartless. I can talk about it without emotion these days,\u201d she says. But while Cathy is tough, she is also warm and selfless; a woman who has not just survived, but thrived.\n\nWhen Aimee was three years old, she was taken into care and fostered. Cathy, who was 17 and pregnant, fought for contact with her niece. The courts granted once a month, which increased to once a week, and she and Aimee became close. Then, when Cathy was 25, social services called out of the blue.\n\n\u201cIt was a Friday afternoon. \u2018Hiya, are you able to take Aimee tonight?\u2019 It was as quick as that because her relationship with the foster parents had broken down.\u201d Cathy\u2019s daughters, Lydia and Autumn, began sharing a room, and Aimee, who was almost 11, got a room to herself. \u201cShe was older. She\u2019d been through a lot more. She had to get the room,\u201d Cathy says. Aimee immediately fitted in. Lydia and Autumn had gained an older sister.\n\nCathy and Aimee had a special bond. \u201cWe\u2019d just lie on the bed and have a conversation. She\u2019d tell me how much she loved me and I\u2019d tell her how much I loved her.\u201d Even as a young teenager, she says, what Aimee wanted most was to be a mum \u2013 to nurture and love a child in a way her own mother had never been able to.\n\n\u201cShe had a massive, infectious laugh,\u201d Cathy says. \u201cThe girls would be upstairs with the Spice Girls on and our Aimee was the worst dancer ever, honest to God! She had no rhythm, but my two girls were brilliant. So I used to take the piss. I\u2019d say: \u2018Come on, do the Spice Girls,\u2019 and she\u2019d go: \u2018No, no, no, no, go out of the room and I\u2019ll do it,\u2019 but I wouldn\u2019t. I\u2019d be by the door and go: \u2018Oh my God!\u2019\u201d Was Aimee upset? \u201cNooo! We had a right giggle about it.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Top left: Lydia McCartney and Aimee; bottom right: Lydia, Cathy Teese, Autumn McCartney and Aimee at Cathy\u2019s wedding in 1999. Photograph: Courtesy of Cathy Teese\n\nBut Aimee grew more rebellious. At 14, she started drinking. Often she would have a drink early in the morning and her school would phone Cathy to complain. Aimee would stay out late, and Cathy would tick her off, but Aimee could always talk her round. \u201cShe had the gift of the gab. She was really popular. She was funny, she won over everybody.\u201d What made her special, Cathy says, is that she never judged others. \u201cYou could have four heads and no legs and she wouldn\u2019t be arsed. She was amazing.\u201d\n\nThe drinking got worse. Cathy encouraged Aimee to come out Thai boxing with the rest of the family, but she wouldn\u2019t. When they came back home, they would find that Aimee could have got through five bottles of beer. \u201cShe was battling stuff in her own head,\u201d Cathy says. \u201cShe talked to me about her mum. She\u2019d say she wished she had what we had as a family.\u201d Even though Cathy treated her like her own, Aimee was conscious that she wasn\u2019t her daughter. \u201cLiving with girls who call me Mum, that\u2019s a smack in the face,\u201d Cathy says.\n\nThe more Aimee drank, the more worried Cathy became about the influence her niece was having on her own children. \u201cI spoke to social services; it got to the stage where it was too much to cope with.\u201d At 15, Aimee went to live with her grandmother in Deal, Kent. She returned briefly to Cathy\u2019s home, and tried her best. But by then she was also abusing substances. \u201cI had a rule that if you\u2019re drinking and doing drugs, I can\u2019t have you around the house. It\u2019s probably one of my regrets,\u201d Cathy says. Even now, you can still see her weighing it up. \u201cBut maybe not, because I didn\u2019t want my girls to see what I\u2019d seen when I was growing up.\u201d\n\nAt 17, Aimee was given a council house. In retrospect, Cathy says this was almost as dangerous as providing her with nothing. \u201cIt was a proper bloody house, with a dining room and everything. She couldn\u2019t cope with that. The whole street was terrace housing, and it was all bums outside. I remember walking down the street and every house was occupied by young people.\u201d Liverpool\u2019s most vulnerable young people had been provided for, but not supported, given homes to play adults in, doss, get wasted and deal drugs.\n\nAimee was moved into a flat \u2013 smaller, more practical, in a better location. She was almost 20, clean and pregnant. Although she and the baby\u2019s father broke up, she embarked on the happiest, most stable period of her life. \u201cShe was fantastic, a natural with babies,\u201d says Cathy. \u201cShe didn\u2019t need teaching anything. I\u2019d ask her advice as much as the other way round. At school meetings, she was faultless.\u201d Aimee volunteered as a cleaner in a care home when her daughter, Emily*, was at nursery. At this stage, Cathy and Aimee were more like sisters. Cathy split up with her partner of 22 years, and it was her niece, now 24, she looked to for comfort. \u201cShe was the first person I went to. She was just there for me.\u201d They would sit in pyjamas and Aimee would roll cigarettes. \u201cI was off the ciggies so I\u2019d say, \u2018Let me just have one\u2019 and she\u2019d be like, \u2018No.\u2019\u201d Aimee was reckless herself, but a strict disciplinarian with those she loved.\n\nEverything seemed too good to be true. Then Aimee became involved with an abusive man. She started drinking and taking drugs again, and handed Emily over to another aunt because she couldn\u2019t cope. Before long she had lost her house and was living on the streets. Cathy lost contact with her.\n\nFive years ago, when Cathy was pregnant with her son Earl, she heard Aimee was homeless. \u201cSomeone said: \u2018Your Aimee\u2019s begging outside Sainsbury\u2019s,\u2019 and I went: \u2018Are you sure?\u2019 She said: \u2018Yeah, I took a photo of her.\u2019\u201d How did she feel? \u201cDevastated. We\u2019ve lost so many people in our family to drugs. I thought about my mum, who was close to Aimee. I thought, bloody hell, it\u2019s not fair on her.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cathy Teese is still coming to terms with her niece Aimee\u2019s death. Photograph: Joel Goodman/The Guardian\n\nA few months later, Aimee turned up for a traumatic reunion. Cathy had just given birth to Earl after a caesarean section, and by now Aimee, who was bisexual, was living with a woman called Marie. \u201cI\u2019d just had a C-section, and I was at home in the bath in terrible pain. In marches Aimee up the stairs into the bathroom. She was pissed as a fart. She was just so overwhelmed with Earl, because she\u2019d had a little brother, Mikey, and Mikey had died. All she kept saying to me while I was pregnant was: \u2018I hope it\u2019s a boy, hope it\u2019s a boy.\u2019 And she was just crying and stroking his face. I didn\u2019t want to take that moment away from her.\u201d But she knew she didn\u2019t want Aimee to return in this condition. \u201cI\u2019d just had a baby. I couldn\u2019t have her coming around like this. I was gutted, though. I felt I\u2019d turned my back on her.\u201d\n\nIn November 2018, Aimee turned up unannounced at her grandmother\u2019s house and stayed for a couple of weeks. Cathy says Aimee knew her nan, Cathy\u2019s mother, would forgive her anything. But one day Aimee said she was going out for cigarettes, and they never saw her again.\n\nMichelle Langan, the homelessness campaigner who saw Aimee hours before she died, has been listening intently; her charity, the Paper Cup Project, supported Aimee for most of her time on the streets. When Cathy talks of Aimee\u2019s warmth and humour, Langan smiles; she remembers Aimee as a great talker. She never saw her begging, but people would give her money. \u201cA guy I know said to me: \u2018I spoke to her the night she died. I chatted to her and gave her a couple of quid to get a drink.\u2019 That\u2019s the kind of person she was.\u201d\n\nJust because you\u2019re homeless doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t have a choice about things Michelle Langan, outreach worker\n\nAimee was generous, always guiding outreach workers to homeless people she considered vulnerable. She was less good at looking after herself. Langan says she looked terrible in the last few weeks of her life. Her gorgeous red hair had been ruined. \u201cOne day she turned up to see us and I said: \u2018What the hell have you done to your hair?\u2019 She said: \u2018I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u2019 It was like somebody had got scissors and chopped it. It was short, just tufts.\u201d\n\nAimee was sharing her tent with a male partner at the end of her life, and ticked many boxes for street homeless women \u2013 a survivor of domestic abuse, a substance and alcohol addict, chaotic family background and vulnerable on many fronts.\n\nLangan says homelessness, and the threat of homelessness, has become much worse in Liverpool in recent years. In May, an average of 86 people used the council\u2019s emergency homeless refuge, Labre House, every night. Last year, more than 5,000 used the council\u2019s Housing Options service, which aims to prevent families from becoming homeless. Langan counts the causes on her fingers \u2013 austerity, universal credit, the bedroom tax, plus cuts to mental health, addiction and homelessness services at a time when the need for them is increasing.\n\nDoes she think that, with more resources, Aimee might still be alive? \u201cYes, she could have gone into rehab 20 times, and the 21st time it might have worked for her. At the moment it\u2019s like: this is your one and only chance and if you fuck it up, you don\u2019t get another.\u201d\n\nCathy is less certain Aimee could have been saved. \u201cWas she let down? Personally I don\u2019t think so. I think she was given the help from a young age all the way through. I think Stephen, my brother who died, was also given a lot of help.\u201d\n\nWhy wasn\u2019t she in a hostel, at the very least? Langan says Aimee hated hostels, but that Liverpool is better than most cities in its provision for homeless people. \u201cLiverpool has got shelter available every night,\u201d she says. \u201cWe fought for this. Beforehand, all over the country it was just when the temperature was -3C or something you opened up a shelter, so I just kept battering the council about this. In the end, the mayor, Joe Anderson, decided to set up a shelter that was open every single night.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest In January, mayor Joe Anderson announced that he would remove all tents from Liverpool city centre Photograph: Liverpool City Council\n\nLabre House is named after the patron saint of homelessness, Benedict Joseph Labre. Unlike many shelters it offers refuge to anybody who is homeless, including those without recourse to public funds \u2013 mostly on mats or in sleeping bags in two long dormitories. It\u2019s a start, Langan says, but far from perfect. \u201cWe speak to people on the streets and feed that back to the council. I was speaking to one guy and said: \u2018Are you going to Labre tonight?\u2019 And he said: \u2018I\u2019m a recovering drinker, and if I\u2019m in a room where I can smell drink, that\u2019s it for me.\u2019 And it can be very intimidating for survivors of domestic violence. So it\u2019s not suitable for everybody, but it\u2019s better than nothing. When I asked Aimee about it she\u2019d say: \u2018Nah, it\u2019s not for me.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen Langan started the Paper Cup Project three years ago, she coaxed and, when necessary, shamed local politicians into walking the streets with her to acknowledge the extent of the homelessness problem. \u201cJoe and I used to fight like cats and dogs. We hated each other.\u201d Why? \u201cBecause in the papers he denied Liverpool had a homelessness problem for ages. He was fed misleading facts and figures, and I kept going: \u2018This is bullshit.\u2019 He\u2019d say: \u2018We\u2019ve only got 12 homeless people,\u2019 because the government said that when you count rough sleepers they have to be bedded down, so if someone is sitting in a doorway, they\u2019re not counted. I got a couple of council cabinet members to come out with us, and they went back to Joe and said: \u2018She\u2019s actually right.\u2019 I then had a chat with him. So now we\u2019re on the same page, and that\u2019s great.\u201d\n\nHomeless deaths: share your tributes Read more\n\nFor Langan, homelessness is a political problem. The Labour party made homelessness a priority when it came to power in 1997, and claimed its Rough Sleepers Initiative reduced rough sleeping by around three-quarters. In March this year, the Conservative government promised \u00a346m over the next two years to help get people off the streets (providing 2,600 beds and 750 extra support staff), but Langan is scathing about its efforts. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have a homelessness problem in 2019. Homeless people don\u2019t have a vote, so the Tory government doesn\u2019t give a shit about them.\u201d Is it incompetence? \u201cNo, I think it\u2019s cruelty and greed. We shouldn\u2019t have people sleeping in doorways in a rich country.\u201d\n\nBoth she and Cathy call it an uncaring culture. \u201cSociety has become callous and cold. It\u2019s me, me, me,\u201d Langan says. Cathy nods. \u201cIt\u2019s completely changed,\u201d she says. \u201cJust seeing people mocking each other, saying: \u2018I\u2019ve got this, you\u2019ve got nothing.\u2019\u201d They talk about common attitudes to homeless people \u2013 be grateful for what you\u2019re given, don\u2019t complain, you are the undeserving poor. \u201cThere was a homeless lad we knew who was a vegetarian,\u201d Langan says, \u201cand when people gave him a ham butty he\u2019d be like: \u2018No thanks, I\u2019m a vegetarian.\u2019 And some people would be like: \u2018Oooh, I tried to give him a butty, and he refused it!\u2019 They\u2019d take offence. I\u2019d be like: \u2018Well, did you actually ask him what he wanted?\u2019 Just because you\u2019re homeless doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t have a choice about things.\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t cut and cut and cut, and not accept consequences. Aimee\u2019s death is a mixture of lack of joined-up thinking and cuts Joe Anderson, mayor of Liverpool\n\nAs we leave, Cathy says she hopes she\u2019s not been too harsh on Aimee. \u201cShe didn\u2019t set out to hurt people, she just did along the way. You wouldn\u2019t have met her and gone: \u2018She\u2019s a pain in the arse.\u2019 You\u2019d say: \u2018Isn\u2019t she a cracking girl?\u2019\u201d\n\nOutside the restaurant we\u2019ve been talking in, two people are bedding down for the night. Both knew Aimee and say she was funny and loud. Mary* tells us she is 17 weeks pregnant and still taking heroin. Moses, a middle-aged man who could pass for elderly, is also an addict. He is filthy, sharp and welcoming. We sit down with them. Moses has a shocking abscess that gnaws deep into a knuckle.\n\nTwo young women approach, and one hands over a large pizza box. Moses politely asks what it contains. \u201cLadies, don\u2019t be offended, but if it\u2019s the remains and it\u2019s cold, it\u2019s better to put it in the bin than give it to me.\u201d The women stare at him, aghast. \u201cRight! Just leave it with him!\u201d screams one, before they stomp off into the night. The box contains the sodden remains of pizza and chips, and a half-eaten chicken leg.\n\nThe Whitechapel Centre, Liverpool\u2019s leading homeless and housing charity, is based in a Victorian school that has seen better days. The smell is overpowering \u2013 booze, fags and sweat. Outside, men (nearly all the service users here are men) smoke by themselves or in huddles. Inside, clients are being served cooked breakfasts, showering, getting legal advice, benefits help or support with their search for accommodation. One man is having his hair cut.\n\nDavid Carter, the chief executive of the Whitechapel Centre and Labre House, has worked with homeless people for decades. He measures the crisis in bald statistics. Five years ago, 1,800 people came through the Whitechapel\u2019s doors; last year, it was 4,025. In 2014, the biggest cause of homelessness was relationship breakdown; now it\u2019s debt. \u201cThe impact of welfare reforms has had such a deep impact on people\u2019s ability to sustain accommodation,\u201d he says. Few of the people they see are simply homeless \u2013 71% have drug or alcohol addictions, 61% have mental health problems, 50% have escaped or experienced abuse.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Michelle Langan of the Paper Cup Project, on the streets of Liverpool city centre, close to where Aimee died. Photograph: Joel Goodman/The Guardian\n\nThe problems are increasingly complex. For example, there are more and more long-term IV substance abusers with amputated limbs needing adapted properties. While the level of need has risen for many clients, austerity, welfare reforms and the economic downturn have all had an impact. \u201cA lot of the preventive services have folded,\u201d Carter says. \u201cSo not only do we have more people coming through, but, at the same time, the options for those people have also decreased.\u201d He says the Whitechapel is lucky \u2013 the charity gets \u00a32.2m a year from the council to fund its services and its 90 staff. But it\u2019s still peanuts. How much money does he need? Double maybe, he says.\n\nWe are joined by Liverpool\u2019s mayor, Joe Anderson, who bombards us with more figures. By next year, Liverpool\u2019s budget will have been slashed by \u00a3444m in a decade, or 64% in real terms \u2013 more than any other UK city. Anderson sounds like Alexei Sayle, sticks the boot into political adversaries with the same relish and has a fondness for the F-word. \u201cWe are spending \u00a350m on housing benefit, which mainly goes to the private sector. Is that not fucking madness? If you built more social housing you wouldn\u2019t be paying that housing benefit bill. It\u2019s absolutely crazy and incompetent.\u201d\n\nWe ask Anderson the official number of rough sleepers in Liverpool city centre. He looks at Carter. \u201cWhat\u2019s your version?\u201d Carter laughs. As Langan said the other night, there are many ways of recording the statistics.\n\n\u201cEach month, our outreach workers record every homeless person they see,\u201d Carter says. \u201cLast month, we saw 76 people bedded down. It has been pretty stable over the past 12 months. Of them, I would say we got 55 into new or existing accommodation.\u201d\n\nBoth men say there are homeless fakes \u2013 people who come into the city to beg, to feed addictions or just make a bit of cash. But they are a small minority. Their priority is to get the genuinely homeless off the street. \u201cThe first rule is: \u2018No second night out.\u2019 When we identify someone sleeping rough, we have them accommodated the following day,\u201d Anderson says. Another motto is: \u201cThere\u2019s always room inside\u201d \u2013 and Anderson insists there is, now that Labre House has opened.\n\nBut the fact remains that both Aimee Teese and Richard Kehoe were street homeless when they died. How does Anderson feel about them dying within three months of each other in tents on the streets of his city? \u201cAbsolute anger. When we talk about eradicating homelessness, it\u2019s not just about moving them out of tents, it\u2019s not just about finding them accommodation, it\u2019s about finding them a job, it\u2019s about changing their lifestyle.\u201d Aimee was imprisoned in the run-up to Christmas 2018, just after disappearing from her grandmother\u2019s home, and Anderson says he was angry when he heard that she had been released, \u201cstill addicted, with all the demons she still had to face \u2013 and we weren\u2019t told about it. And the worst thing is she stayed a bit out of the city centre in a grim area next to a housing estate that we\u2019ve got boarded up. If we\u2019d known about it, Whitechapel could have done something. She might not have died.\u201d\n\nWho is Anderson most angry with? \u201cThe system. Everybody. Me!\u201d How has he messed up? \u201cI feel guilty because I manage a city council, a system, that is not joined up. It hurts. I remember David Cameron coming in and talking about the \u2018big society\u2019 \u2013 and it\u2019s the fucking broken society. That\u2019s what we\u2019re dealing with. And you can\u2019t cut and cut and cut, and not accept consequences. Aimee\u2019s\u2019s death is a mixture of lack of joined-up thinking and cuts. If we\u2019d had more public health workers connecting into probation, connecting into the Prison Service, we would have been told about her.\u201d\n\nIt is certainly true that people are slipping through some very leaky nets. But it\u2019s not correct that nobody knew Aimee was living in a tent. After all, Langan visited her on the night she died.\n\nWhy does Anderson believe that getting rid of tents is the answer? Many homeless people say a tent gives them privacy and a degree of warmth. Anderson insists that is the wrong starting point \u2013 there is no reason for anybody to be homeless in Liverpool; every night there are spare rooms at the YMCA or Labre House. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for anybody to sleep on the streets. If people choose to live on the streets, because they have mental health issues, for instance, then we\u2019ll take that into consideration. But if somebody\u2019s in a tent and they\u2019re jacking up and doing stuff to themselves that no one can see, how are we going to know?\u201d\n\nCarter and Anderson say that much of the city\u2019s homeless drug dealing is done from within tents. The bottom line, Anderson says, is that tents hide illegal activity and vulnerable people who need support. When he announced the zero-tolerance policy on tents, people were sceptical \u2013 and worse. \u201cI got a lot of shit on Twitter, as we usually do. People say we\u2019re not doing enough. The city\u2019s not doing enough. I get it all the time. People want to blame somebody for the problems we have in the city. They want to get angry with somebody, so they get angry with me.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t think she would ever be homeless and I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever die. Cathy Teese\n\nThe mayor has a reputation for grandstanding, but there is no questioning his desire to tackle the crisis. We mention pregnant Mary, who we met on the streets the previous night. Anderson and Carter look at each other. \u201cAh. We know her very, very well,\u201d Anderson says. \u201cAnd you know why she won\u2019t accept accommodation? She\u2019s had children before, she\u2019s a drug user and we have a child protection order on the baby. We have issues with the father of the baby, her partner. She wants to live with him, and the order stops that happening. There\u2019s much more to your story.\u201d His version is consistent with what Mary told us \u2013 she admitted she was still taking heroin. Anderson says, as with Aimee Teese, it would be pointless to address her housing situation without tackling her addiction issues.\n\nIt is late June, almost six months since Aimee died and three months since Anderson announced he was going to remove tents from the streets of Liverpool. We meet up with Langan and Cathy to distribute food and clothes to homeless people. Cathy now volunteers for the Paper Cup Project as an outreach worker. She says it has given her a new sense of purpose.\n\nAnderson is not the only public official who has been clearing tents from the streets. The Guardian has just revealed that the number of homeless camps forcibly removed by councils across the UK has more than trebled in four years (from 72 in 2014 to 254 last year). An encampment was defined as a location where one or more homeless people were living on private or public land. The Guardian also revealed there were 1,241 complaints to councils last year regarding \u201ctent cities\u201d and that some councils (including Brighton and East Dorset) charge for the return of seized tents.\n\nAt Aimee\u2019s inquest in April, the coroner recorded that she had been found dead in her tent in the back yard of a disused factory. It was revealed she had a medical history of hepatitis C, and drug and alcohol addiction. In the hours before her death she had smoked crack cocaine with her partner and used heroin \u201cwithin the range of a fatal dose\u201d. She was found by her partner, who returned to the tent after a disagreement with her. Cathy says her niece\u2019s death has turned her life upside down. \u201cIt\u2019s split me and my partner up. He\u2019s a bit younger than I am, and he didn\u2019t understand what I was going through. I kept everything in on myself. And I blame myself a lot as well. I took a lot of the guilt because I shouldn\u2019t have said what I said to her.\u201d What does she mean? \u201cI said: \u2018With drink and drugs, I can\u2019t have you around here.\u2019\u201d She is becoming tearful. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t think she would ever be homeless and I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever die.\u201d\n\nAimee\u2019s inquest recorded that in the hours before her death she had smoked crack cocaine with her partner and used heroin \u2018within the range of a fatal dose\u2019. Photograph: Facebook\n\nThere isn\u2019t a day Cathy doesn\u2019t think about Aimee. But one huge positive has come out of all this. She whips a photo out of her wallet. \u201cThat\u2019s me, Aimee and her daughter Emily when she was a baby.\u201d Cathy had been close to Emily, who is now 10 and still living with another aunt. Four years after losing contact with each other, she and Emily are rebuilding their relationship. Cathy is overjoyed to have her back in her life. \u201cI had her for the day a few weeks ago,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re just getting to know each other again and we had an absolute ball. We went swimming and went to Anfield to watch the match. The kids love that they\u2019ve got a new cousin.\u201d\n\nCathy still hasn\u2019t come to terms with Aimee\u2019s death, even though she half expected it. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it would come to this at 30. It sounds cold, but I thought she would die from drugs and things, but that she would be older.\u201d\n\nIt was Cathy who identified the body. What shocked her most was Aimee\u2019s hair. \u201cShe had gorgeous hair. She was so proud of it \u2013 long and dyed red. And when I went to see her, it was all chopped off.\u201d\n\nShe was left alone with Aimee\u2019s body. Cathy says it took her ages to say anything, then she let rip. \u201cI gave her a bollocking. I gave her a really good bollocking. I told her off like a proper parent. I said: \u2018I\u2019m totally fucking pissed off with you.\u2019 I was just kind of ranting. It felt good.\u201d She is laughing and crying as she says this. \u201cAnd then when I finished bollocking her, I told her I loved her.\u201d\n\nIndicated names (*) have been changed.\n\nIn the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.
