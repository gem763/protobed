USA TODAY\n\nHOUSTON \u2013 Come November, Gerrit Cole and Alex Bregman may be awarded two of the most cherished plaques in baseball and bring the American League\u2019s Cy Young and Most Valuable Player awards back to Houston.\n\nThere is another trophy they cherish above all, however, one that may slip through their grasp if they cannot reverse what ailed them in Game 1 of the World Series.\n\nQuickly.\n\n\u201cI have to figure it out, ASAP, because I have to be better,\u201d Bregman said after his postseason failures extended to Tuesday night and a 5-4 Washington Nationals conquest that saw the third baseman fail in several key spots.\n\n\u201cIt starts with me. I was horrible. All night.\u201d\n\nCole had not been beaten since May 22, a 19-game winning streak that continued through three dominant postseason starts. But the man who struck out 338 batters in the regular season and mowed down the Tampa Bay Rays and New York Yankees in three playoff starts had no answer for Juan Soto, the Nationals\u2019 precocious slugger.\n\nGAME 1: Springer sets record with HR in fifth straight World Series game\n\nTACO TUESDAY: Trea Turner's steal wins free Taco Bell for everybody\n\nIn the fourth inning, Soto took a decent Cole pitch to the train tracks in left field for a game-tying home run. In the fifth, Soto killed a spinning Cole slider to left field, clanging off the scoreboard for a two-run double and a 5-2 lead.\n\nTip your cap, Cole said of the home run. The double?\n\n\u201cThe slider was poor,\u201d said Cole, who posted a 2.50 regular season ERA and had given up just one run (0.40 ERA) this postseason before coughing up five in seven innings Tuesday. \u201cDidn\u2019t end up over the heart of the plate, didn\u2019t break like we wanted it to but he again used the whole field, stayed back within himself. Good hitters do that.\u201d\n\nIf Cole was sanguine, color Bregman sullen.\n\nOne of the game\u2019s most magnetic players and a postseason hero during their 2017 World Series run, Bregman has had a miserable postseason this time around. After an 0-for-4, three-strikeout performance in Game 1, he\u2019s now in a 3 for 22 funk spanning the ALCS and Game 1.\n\nIn fact, he\u2019s going so bad, he let a grateful reliever get away with an egregious mistake.\n\nAfter burning through top right-handed reliever Daniel Hudson to escape a seventh-inning jam, lefty Sean Doolittle was forced to face three daunting righty hitters \u2013 Bregman, Yuli Gurriel and Carlos Correa leading off the ninth.\n\nBregman got the count in his favor, at 2-1. Doolittle, whose velocity was down for most of his 1 \u2153-inning save, botched the next pitch \u2013 a 92-mph fastball that fluttered over the heart of the plate.\n\nIt was a cookie, a gift from the baseball gods meant to be crushed into the Crawford Boxes for a game-tying home run.\n\nDoolittle was sufficiently horrified after he released the pitch.\n\n\u201cOh my gosh. I knew I got away with one there,\u201d Doolittle said. \u201cBaseball\u2019s so weird because I was trying to go away. I\u2019m not sure if the ball cut on me or if I just yanked it and it ended up right down the middle of the plate. But the weird thing is you could tell by the way he took it, it felt inside to him, even though it was right down the middle.\n\n\u201cI think he was looking away. So, if I hit my spot, then I would\u2019ve fallen right into what he was looking for. Because I missed my spot \u2013 over the heart of the plate \u2013 I got away with it.\n\n\u201cI knew I got away with it. I looked at (catcher Kurt Suzuki) and kind of shook my head and in between pitches I was like, \u2018I gotta put him away here. I can\u2019t keep giving him looks. I can\u2019t keep giving him looks. I just got away with one. He\u2019s too good of a hitter.\u2019\u201d\n\nAlex Bregman reacts after striking out in the ninth inning. (Photo: David J. Phillip, AP)\n\nNot to worry. Doolittle punched him out on the next pitch, leaving Bregman awaiting a long night curled up with all his equipment.\n\n\u201cI need to get in that video room and get in the cage and figure it out and figure it out quick because we face another good pitcher tomorrow,\u201d he said, an eye toward Game 2 Nationals starter Stephen Strasburg. \u201cI have been horrible mechanically, been off time, been in between, taking fastballs for strikes, taking sliders for strikes. swinging at bad pitches out of the zone.\n\n\"Better take my bat home, sleep with it, figure it out.\"\n\nThe Astros will counter in Game 2 with Justin Verlander, a game Cole said will \u201cstart the recovery process.\u201d Nobody\u2019s playing better than the Nationals right now \u2013 they\u2019re on a stunning 83-40 run that includes a 9-2 postseason ledger \u2013 and while the Astros are probably superior on paper, they are not playing up to that expectation.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re pretty good,\u201d says Bregman. \u201cThey did a good job pitching to us. We gotta get better.\u201d", "description": "The favorites for the AL MVP and Cy Young awards struggled in Game 1 of the World Series, allowing the Nationals to seize control of the series.", "authors": ["Gabe Lacques", "Published A.M.
