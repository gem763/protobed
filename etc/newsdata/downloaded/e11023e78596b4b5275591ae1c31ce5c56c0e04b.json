Trump, however, spoke for 48 minutes on Sunday when he revealed that U.S. forces had killed Baghdadi (right) in Syria\n\nTrump continued: 'They did a lot of shooting and they did a lot of blasting, even not going through the front door. You know, you would think you go through the door. If you're a normal person, you say, 'Knock, knock. May I come in?''\n\n'After a fire fight, they killed Osama bin Laden and took custody of his body,' Obama said.\n\nTrump followed up in the video saying: 'He died like a dog.'\n\nObama went on to say: 'His death does not mark the end of our effort.'\n\n'A beautiful dog, a talented dog,' Trump said in reference to the K-9 fighter that was injured during the capture of Baghdadi.\n\n'We give thanks to the men who carried out this operation,' Obama said.\n\nTrump continued: 'I don't get any credit for this, but that's OK. I never do. But here we are.'", "description": "Jimmy Kimmel created a mash up of Trump and Obama's televised national addresses following the killings of the Al Qaeda and ISIS leaders.", "authors": ["Emily Crane For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/16/20385848-0-image-a-35_1572452548541.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
