General Assembly on Tuesday.\n\n\"The future does not belong to globalists; it belongs to patriots,\" Trump said.\n\nThis is Trump's third address to the General Assembly as president. As he has done in the past, Trump used his remarks to the international organization to make the case for his \"America first\" style of diplomacy that puts nationalism ahead of multilateral efforts.\n\nTrump's remarks also included sharp warnings for China and Iran.\n\nThe U.S. issued a new round of sanctions against Iran on Friday after the U.S. blamed Iran for an attack on a Saudi oil facility.\n\nWhile Trump seeks to rein in Iran, Democrats in Congress are raising the specter of impeachment over Trump's reported interactions with the Ukrainian government.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden during a July phone call. And multiple outlets have reported that a whistleblower complaint involves Trump's communications with Ukraine.\n\nTrump is also grappling with a potentially diminished role for U.S. leadership on the global stage. A new survey of 50 former U.S. ambassadors and senior national security officials by the Global Situation Room public relations firm finds that top diplomats from Republican and Democratic administrations almost unanimously feel U.S. influence has declined under Trump.\n\nNPR White House correspondent Franco Ordo\u00f1ez contributed to this report.", "description": "Trump's speech comes as his administration confronts foreign policy challenges in the Middle East and a growing political scandal in Washington.", "authors": ["Ayesha Rascoe"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/09/24/ap_19267514618387_wide-ba249d4d5ce177361190174a017659d45b32f321.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
