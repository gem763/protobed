They must also have known that a veto in Northern Ireland would never have flown. They were duped,\u201d said the source.\n\nMeanwhile, Johnson and his aides were taking an increasingly emollient tone towards Dublin. Michel Barnier disclosed that Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar agreed in their summit in the Wirral that there would be no customs checks at the land border.\n\nThis suggests that the prime minister had agreed to cross a DUP red line before he and Arlene Foster had their first of three sets of meetings in Downing Street. \u201cHe calculated that he needed a deal more than he needed the DUP,\u201d said one source.\n\nIf he is to win without Foster\u2019s 10 MPs, Johnson will need many of the hardliners in the European Research Group (ERG) to forget their fealty to the DUP. He\u2019ll also have to win over a handful of Labour MPs, which explains why it is the cabinet\u2019s softer Brexiters \u2013 Matt Hancock and Robert Jenrick, for example \u2013 who have been sent out to defend the deal in the media.\n\nJohnson\u2019s political secretary, Danny Kruger, has already been reaching out to some Labour MPs; and Downing Street hinted at the possibility of more concessions on workers\u2019 rights and other issues close to the hearts of Labour MPs as the withdrawal agreement bill makes its way through parliament.\n\nBut if the prime minister loses, he will aim to call a snap general election \u2013 a request Labour would be reluctant to block for a third time, once a Brexit delay has been secured \u2013 and campaign on the basis of getting his deal done.\n\nThe Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, was already due to speak at a big rally in Westminster on Friday evening, and he will no doubt use it to cry betrayal and seek to outflank the Tories with the promise of a clean-break Brexit (essentially a no deal).\n\nFarage trounced Theresa May\u2019s Conservatives in May\u2019s European elections, and much of Johnson\u2019s strategy since arriving in Downing Street has focused on trying to reunite the leave vote.\n\nNumber 10 believes the theatre around this week\u2019s deal \u2013 the fact Johnson succeeded in reopening the withdrawal agreement and securing concessions (albeit by making a few of his own) \u2013 will help to convince most Brexit voters that he\u2019s on their side.\n\nPlay Video 1:10 Boris Johnson confident parliament will back his new Brexit deal \u2013 video\n\nThe whipless wonders \u2013 the rebel ex-Tories who were disciplined for backing the Benn act \u2013 have some concerns about the deal.\n\nBut that there is now an agreement with the EU27 will assuage their worst fear: that the next Conservative manifesto would advocate a no-deal Brexit.\n\nIf they return to the fold, they could go on to campaign on the basis of the Conservatives\u2019 domestic policy commitments, on schools, hospitals and crime.\n\nWhen Johnson tabled his \u201cfinal offer\u201d at the Tory party conference (not that he ever used that language himself), the reaction from many MPs was that he was deliberately setting himself up to fail because his ultimate aim was to secure a no-deal Brexit.\n\nYet while his mercurial adviser Cummings may have been relaxed about the implications of no deal, Johnson became increasingly convinced it would be too risky, and prepared to make concessions.\n\nMost crucially, rather than waffling about \u201calternative arrangements\u201d, the government made clear it was ready to swallow customs checks in the Irish Sea: something May had suggested no prime minister could possibly sign up to.\n\nClad in his trademark gilet and rumpled white shirt, Cummings was in Brussels on Thursday to watch the deal being done. He, like many of the other Vote Leave veterans in Number 10, sees his task in Downing Street as completing the job they began during that 2016 campaign.\n\nAs those explosive briefings from \u201cDowning Street sources\u201d about Johnson\u2019s tetchy phone call with Angela Merkel made clear, they were ready to trash relations with Britain\u2019s EU partners if it got Britain out, \u201cdo or die\u201d by 31 October.\n\nBut while Johnson does want to fulfil the promises of the Vote Leave campaign with which he will always be so personally associated, he also wants to secure himself a nice comfortable majority, and a five-year term behind the big black door. It may be just weeks before voters get the chance to decide whether to give it to him.", "description": "PM will hope to pass his deal on Saturday but knows rejection will set him up for a general election", "authors": ["Heather Stewart", "Lisa O'Carroll"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/861e2e3f8e3fa764e0456ede11491737713576d3/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=abd9af8315e79559e7243529ccf39ac8", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
