Send money to Julian Castro or campaign ends in 10 days", "language": "en", "text": "Hey, it worked for Cory Booker. Just a month ago, Booker sounded the alarm to his supporters \u2013 send him $1.7 million in nine days or his campaign would be kaput. He met his deadline and now Julian Castro is making the same plea. Castro needs $800,000 within the next 10 days to keep his campaign afloat. That sounds like a bargain compared to Booker\u2019s goal.\n\nLet\u2019s be honest here, Julian Castro is not going to be the Democrat nominee for president in 2020. He\u2019s only registering at 0.6 at Real Clear Politics. That puts him ahead of only three others \u2013 Tim Ryan, Marianne Williamson, and Steve Bullock. Of the first four contests, Castro only registers in two states \u2013 Nevada and South Carolina. In both of those states, he registers at .5. So, at this point, he\u2019s really only hoping to stay in for long enough to be considered as the choice for vice-president.\n\nNonetheless, Julian persists. He needs to find some supporters who are willing to toss some donations into the dumpster fire that is his campaign. The clock is ticking.\n\n\u201cIf I can\u2019t raise $800,000 in the next 10 days, I will have no choice but to end my race for president,\u201d Castro\u2019s campaign wrote in an email to supporters. \u201cI\u2019m asking you to fight for me like never before. If I don\u2019t meet this deadline, I won\u2019t have the resources to keep my campaign running.\u201d\n\nCastro has not qualified for the November Democrat debate. He has until November 13 to meet the polling requirement, which is at a higher threshold than previous debates. The November debate threshold requires a candidate to register 3 percent in four approved polls to qualify. At this rate, Castro would be lucky to break 1 percent, let alone 3 percent. His campaign acknowledges that if he fails to earn a place on the debate stage, his campaign is toast. More money is needed for greater outreach on the campaign trail in the form of advertising seems to be the message.\n\nMaya Rupert, Castro\u2019s campaign manager, referred to the money shortage as the campaign\u2019s biggest challenge yet. \u201cUnfortunately, we do not see a path to victory that doesn\u2019t include making the November debate stage, and without a significant uptick in our fundraising, we cannot make that debate,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nHis best fundraising efforts are not enough to surpass the money raised by the top tier candidates. He is really low on cash for a national campaign.\n\nCastro last week reported his best fundraising quarter thus far: $3.5 million. But it fell well short of what those in a higher tier of the race brought in: Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders ($25.3 million); Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren ($24.6 million); South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg ($19.1 million); and former Vice President Joe Biden ($15.2 million.) Castro, who has kept a full travel schedule, also reported sinking perilously low in available campaign cash \u2014 to $675,000 Oct. 1.\n\nCory Booker\u2019s campaign received about half of the donations needed for his campaign to continue within the first two days after his plea went out. In the case of Castro, his campaign spokesman said the first day\u2019s fundraising goal was met. He didn\u2019t, however, say exactly the amount of that goal. Sawyer Hackett said the money will be needed to help with the efforts to meet the polling requirement, like organizing in early states.\n\n\u201cOrganizing, TV advertising, digital advertising, being able to pay to go to these candidate forums and have a presence at these statewide events \u2014 all of that,\u201d Hackett said. \u201cThe problem is that there\u2019s no path to victory without making the debate stage.\u201d\n\nThe campaign may not be releasing actual numbers yet but within 24 hours, some influential like-minded leftist heavy hitters weighed in.\n\nU.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a first-term New York Democrat with a wide following, tweeted that Castro \u201cis a powerful presence in this race.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 who endorsed Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders over the weekend \u2014 said that Castro \u201cconsistently uses his platform to uplift & center issues that are wrongly marginalized, like homelessness and police violence.\u201d Adrian Reyna, strategy director for United We Dream, which bills itself as the nation\u2019s largest immigrant youth network, said he had sent his contribution. \u201cIt is imperative that his voice is present in this election. Juli\u00e1n Castro is the only candidate who keeps it real on immigration (also only Latinx in the running) \u2014 so square up and donate!\u201d Comedian Abby Govindan told her 52,000 Twitter followers that Castro \u201cworked hard to get a seat at the table so that people like him wouldn\u2019t have it as hard. He is the American Dream. Even if he\u2019s not your first choice please donate to keep him in the race. We need his voice. He has consistently centered police violence, poor people, people of color and trans people in a way that many frontrunners have failed to do.\u201d Similarly, the Human Rights Campaign\u2019s Charlotte Clymer wrote that Castro\u2019s \u201coutreach, empathy, and commitment have made him an invaluable part of this process. I\u2019m not endorsing anyone yet, but Castro deserves to stay in this race.\u201d\n\nThey may not be supporting him with their own votes but they think Castro is needed in the race because he fights, or something. Most of this has to do with the fact that Castro is the only Latino running and his immigration policy is popular with the open borders crowd. Now we wait and see if Castro makes his own deadline. It\u2019s time to thin the herd of candidates and he may be the next one to go.", "description": "\"I will have no choice but to end my race for president.\u201d", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/JulianCastro.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
