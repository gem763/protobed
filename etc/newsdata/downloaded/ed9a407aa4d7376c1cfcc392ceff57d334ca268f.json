Seriously, let\u2019s not mention those last two again \u2018cause they aren\u2019t shipping until late 2020, but I figured you\u2019d want to know.\n\nBut let\u2019s say you\u2019re ready to buy a new Surface right now, perhaps because they\u2019ve finally got USB-C ports instead of needing to charge and sling data over a proprietary Surface Connect cable. Should you nab the Surface Pro X with its new Qualcomm processor? Or the Surface Pro 7 with Intel?\n\nDepends what you care about most.\n\nPower for your programs: Surface Pro 7, probably\n\nThis might make your decision real easy.\n\nWe won\u2019t know for sure until we\u2019ve got review units in our hands, but it\u2019s probably safe to say the Surface Pro 7\u2019s Intel processor is a better bet than the ARM-based Qualcomm chip in the Surface Pro X if you use traditional Windows desktop apps and are set on pre-ordering right away.\n\nWhile Windows 10 does let you run those Win32 programs on ARM-based chips now, we\u2019ve never had a great time doing so because we\u2019d run into apps that wouldn\u2019t work. Developers need to recompile some programs to work on ARM, many haven\u2019t bothered doing that, and Windows on ARM straight up doesn\u2019t support some tech you might need for PC gaming like OpenGL.\n\nAnd while we\u2019re optimistic that Qualcomm\u2019s chip might prove to run basic Windows and web browsing tasks faster \u2014 recent iPad Pros prove that ARM processors are no slouch, and this one\u2019s clocked at up to 3GHz with 2 teraflops of graphical oomph \u2014 we\u2019re still talking about a 7-watt ARM processor compared to a selection of dual- and quad-core 15-watt CPUs from Intel that won\u2019t be hamstrung by any incompatibility issues.\n\nBut assuming you\u2019re not worried about that, or your life mostly lives in the web...\n\nPortability: Surface Pro X\n\nIf you absolutely need the easiest possible Microsoft tablet to carry around, the Surface Pro X is your slate. While it\u2019s actually the same 1.7 pound weight and has a larger 13-inch display compared to the 12.3-inch Surface Pro 7, it\u2019s far thinner at just 7.3mm thick compared to 8.38mm \u2014 just take a look at our photo above.\n\nThe Verge\u2019s Tom Warren says that thinness actually makes the tablet feel lighter in the hand, and it\u2019ll slide into your bag that much more easily.\n\nThere\u2019s also built-in LTE cellular connectivity too thanks to that Qualcomm chip, so you don\u2019t need to pay extra for an LTE version. Just tack it onto your phone plan and you should be good to go. (The Surface Pro 7 does have Wi-Fi 6, though.)\n\nAnd if you\u2019re a stylus user, the Surface Pro X has a feature that might keep you from ever losing it again \u2014 because you can cleverly stash it right inside the optional keyboard cover\u2019s hinge.\n\nWith 13 hours of battery life to the Surface Pro 7\u2019s 10.5 hours, it should last longer on the go as well \u2014 though keep in mind that both of those numbers were tested with the screen\u2019s brightness set to a fairly dim 150 nits. You\u2019ll probably be using it set brighter, particularly if you go outdoors.\n\nPorts: Surface Pro 7\n\nThe Surface Pro 7 has a USB-A port, a 3.5mm headphone jack and a microSD card reader, in addition to its new USB-C port.\n\nThe Surface Pro X does not. It\u2019s got two USB-C ports \u2014 which is nice \u2014 but you may end up using Bluetooth headphones and/or dongles.\n\nBoth have the proprietary Surface Connect port as well, for data and another way to charge. Neither support Thunderbolt 3.\n\nPrice: Surface Pro 7\n\nTechnically, you can run up the price of the Surface Pro 7 even higher than the Surface Pro X, if you need the Core i7 with 16GB of memory and 512GB or 1TB of solid-state storage \u2014 those will cost you a cool $1,899 or $2,299 respectively. There\u2019s no 1TB option for the X, and its 16GB / 512GB configuration is actually $100 cheaper at $1,799.\n\nBut if you\u2019re a price-conscious shopper who\u2019ll settle for less silicon, the Surface Pro 7 starts cheaper and stays cheaper for the same quantities of memory and storage until you get to those upper echelons. Here\u2019s a chart that lays it out:\n\nSurface Pro X vs. Surface Pro 7 pricing Price Surface Pro 7 Surface Pro X Price Surface Pro 7 Surface Pro X $749 Core i3 / 4GB / 128GB $899 Core i5 / 8GB / 128GB $999 SQ1 / 8GB / 128GB $1,199 Core i5 / 8GB / 256GB $1,299 SQ1 / 8GB / 256GB $1,399 Core i5 / 16GB / 256GB $1,499 Core i7 / 16GB / 256GB $1,799 SQ1 / 16GB / 512GB $1,899 Core i7 / 16GB / 512GB $2,299 Core i7 / 16GB / 1TB\n\nAnd while the Surface Pro X technically has an upgradable SSD, it\u2019s not necessarily going to be as easy as it originally sounded: you\u2019ll need to find and buy a fairly niche M.2 2230 solid state drive (they\u2019re much shorter than the standard varieties) to make that work.\n\nPlus, all of these prices are without adding the optional keyboard and stylus you may want to turn these tablets into multi-functional work machines \u2014 and at $139.99, that Surface Pro X keyboard will cost you an extra $10 over the standard Surface Pro type cover, while the new $144.99 Surface Slim Pen is a good $45 pricier than the standard model.\n\nMind you, that\u2019s for a pen that can now wirelessly charge by docking with that keyboard, or with its included wireless charging cradle instead of needing a AAAA battery. But if you\u2019re looking for the less expensive option it\u2019s something to keep in mind.\n\nObligatory: you could just wait for the reviews\n\nThose are the big reasons you might pick a Surface Pro X over a Surface Pro 7, based on the info we have today. (The Surface Pro X also has a 10-megapixel rear camera that records 4K video to the Surface Pro 7\u2019s 8MP, 1080p camera, but that didn\u2019t feel worthy of a breakout.)\n\nIt\u2019s totally possible one of these two devices will under- or over-deliver, though, so watch for our reviews later this fall.", "description": "If you\u2019re ready to buy a new Surface Pro tablet right now \u2014 perhaps because they\u2019ve finally got USB-C ports instead of needing to charge and sling data over a proprietary Surface Connect cable \u2014 Should you nab the Surface Pro X with its new Qualcomm processor?
