From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIs the issue a matter for the courts?\n\nAt the centre of the government\u2019s case is the claim that the prime minister\u2019s right to prorogue parliament is a prerogative power, invested in him by the monarch, and therefore not a matter for the courts.\n\nGovernment lawyers argued that it was perfectly legitimate for Johnson to suspend parliament in the manner that he did, but that, even if it was not, this was a matter for parliament itself and not the judiciary. MPs had the option of passing a law to block the prorogation and failed to do so, they said. Given this, it was not for the courts to step in.\n\nSome of the judges seemed sceptical of the suggestion that the issue is not, to use the legal term, justiciable. They asked if the government was claiming that, even if the prime minister closed parliament for as long as a year, it would still not be a matter for the courts. This is a difficult argument to make.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Supreme Court protests: Boris Johnson's prorogation legal or not? Show all 15 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

He said that even the prime minister\u2019s prerogative powers must have limits and one of those limits must be that the use of them should not undermine parliamentary sovereignty.\n\nPlus, he said, if parliament is prorogued, then the courts are \u201cthe last constitutional actor\u201d and must intervene.\n\nIs there a limit on the prime minister\u2019s power to prorogue parliament?\n\nIf the Supreme Court decides that the issue is justiciable (that is, a matter for the courts) then the next issue it is likely to look at are the limits \u2013 if there are any \u2013 on the prime minister\u2019s power to prorogue parliament.\n\nNo one disputes that Johnson, like any prime minister, has this power. But the court must decide whether it can be exercised in any circumstances or whether other legal principles \u2013 such as the importance of parliament being able to fulfil its role of holding the government to account \u2013 take priority.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The government\u2019s opponents say this is exactly what the job of the courts is, and a role that they fulfil frequently.\n\nDid Boris Johnson breach the limits on the power to prorogue parliament and therefore act unlawfully?\n\nIf the court decides that there are limits on the power to prorogue parliament, then it will need to rule on whether Johnson breached these limits in this case.\n\nThe government\u2019s opponents argued that a five-week suspension was highly unusual and that there was no reason to have such a long break before a Queen\u2019s Speech. They said the court should therefore infer that there was another motive behind Johnson\u2019s decision \u2013 namely to \u201csilence\u201d parliament and stop it interfering with his Brexit plans.\n\nSir John Major, the former prime minister, supported this suggestion, arguing in a witness statement that Johnson had \u201culterior motives\u201d and that the reasons put forward by the government were \u201cnot true\u201d.\n\nThe government insisted this was not the case. It claimed that the prorogation resulted in only seven more parliamentary days being lost because there is usually a three-week break in September to allow MPs and peers to attend the party conferences.\n\nThey said that parliament had time to pass legislation before the prorogation started and will have plenty of time after the suspension ends in which to do so before the 31 October Brexit deadline.\n\nBut government lawyers struggled to explain why a five-week prorogation was needed to allow for a Queen\u2019s Speech, and were undermined in their argument when the court was told that parliament has not been suspended for so long before a Queen\u2019s Speech for more than 40 years.\n\nIn truth, it may not matter what the judges think the prime minister\u2019s motives were, if they decide that the consequence was that he undermined parliament\u2019s power to hold the government to account.\n\nThe court was told that prorogation is much more of a barrier to parliamentary scrutiny than a normal recess, because bills before parliament are dropped, select committees do not sit and the government does not answer questions from MPs and peers.\n\nThat means that, even if Boris Johnson did not set out to obstruct parliament, that may have been the effect, and that he therefore acted unlawfully.\n\nEven if Boris Johnson acted unlawfully in asking the Queen to prorogue parliament, was the prorogation itself unlawful?\n\nAs well as arguing that the case as a whole was not a matter for the courts, and that even if it was, that Johnson had acted entirely lawfully, the government made a third argument.\n\nIt claimed that even if it lost on its two other arguments and the court ruled that Mr Johnson\u2019s advice to the Queen was unlawful, this did not mean that the actual prorogation of parliament was also unlawful.\n\nThis is because prorogation happens in several stages. First, the prime minister advises the monarch to suspend parliament. Then the monarch approves a Privy Council order announcing the dates when parliament will be prorogued.\n\nThe government claimed that the issuing of the prorogation order was a parliamentary matter and should therefore be seen as \u201cforbidden territory\u201d under article nine of the Bill of Rights \u2013 even if Mr Johnson\u2019s advice that led to it was unlawful. This article says it is for parliament and no one else to decide how parliament governs itself.\n\nThis suggestion was hotly disputed in court. Lord Pannick said that any prorogation based on unlawful advice should itself be ruled unlawful. He argued that the prorogation order was clearly not part of parliamentary business and instead \u201cpreceded the proceedings in parliament\u201d. It was therefore fully appropriate for the courts to declare it invalid, he said.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Getty\n\nWhat should happen next?\n\nIf it declares that the prorogation was unlawful, the court may need to decide what should happen next.\n\nDuring the hearing, both sides said they would be satisfied with a simple ruling on whether the prorogation was unlawful. This means that, if the judges rule against the government, they would leave the question of what happens next to the government.\n\nIt is far from clear what would happen next. Government lawyers refused to rule out Johnson suspending parliament for a second time or, depending on what the court says, refusing to recall it at all.\n\nThis means there is the potential for an explosive row \u2013 and possibly another legal battle.\n\nLord Pannick insisted that parliament should be recalled \u201curgently\u201d next week if the prorogation is declared unlawful. If the government refuses, he said, then the speakers of the House of Commons and House of Lords could intervene to recall parliament themselves.\n\nHe asked the judges to provide some clarity by making a recommendation as to what should happen, even if they do not issue a binding order.\n\nIf Johnson is ruled to have acted unlawfully but refuses to recall parliament, the government could find itself back in court within days.
