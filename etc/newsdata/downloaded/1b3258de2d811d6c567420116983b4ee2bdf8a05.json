Canada is getting ready to enact the second stage of its legalization drive, opening markets for CBD extracts, beverages, and edibles. The Canadian market is estimated to account for 12% of global marijuana sales by the end of this year. The scale of the US market compensates for the patchwork legalization landscape; US legal cannabis will account for 80% of global sales this year, according to Arcview Market Research.\n\nTroy Dayton, CEO of Arcview, sees CBD as the driver for cannabis sales through 2024. He says, \u201cCBD products on the shelves of grocery stores and mass merchants is just the first act in the \u201cCannabinoids Everywhere\u201d phenomenon. Unlike with alcohol, coffee or other plant-sourced consumables, cannabis product marketers have more than taste and strength to work with; they also have the subtle effects of 100-plus cannabinoids other than THC. The popularity of CBD is the first inkling of things to come.\u201d\n\nIn a report released earlier this summer, retail data analytics firm Nielsen points out that the initial legalization cannabis focused on dried flower products but that the upcoming wave of new derivative products, oils, edibles, and drinks have both higher gross margins and no supply chain bottlenecks. The Nielsen report predicts the US cannabis market reaching $41 billion by 2025.\n\nSo, with the market primed to expand, it\u2019s clear that there is a lot of money to be made in marijuana stocks. The segment\u2019s recent dip \u2013 at least three major players are at one-year lows as of yesterday \u2013 offers a savvy investor a chance to buy in at low prices and high upside potential. We\u2019ve used TipRanks\u2019 Stock Screener tool to find three small-cap marijuana companies with well over 100% upside potential. Let's take a closer look:\n\nGreen Thumb Industries\n\nChicago-based Green Thumb (GTBIF \u2013 Get Report) owns the Rise and Essence brands of retail cannabis outlets, with more than 50 retail stores under the Rise name and additional outlets through third-party marketers. Green Thumb\u2019s calendar Q2 earnings release showed $44.7 million in revenues, a 60% sequential gain and a 228% year-over-year gain. Organic consumer product growth and increased store traffic powered the revenue gains. Along with fast-growing revenue, the company also boasts a strong cash position, with $83 million in liabilities more than balanced by $117 million cash on hand. CEO Ben Kolver stated of the company\u2019s forward prospects, \u201cContinued execution of key priorities such as\u2026 accelerated store openings, and expanded distribution of our brand portfolio, sets us up well for the future.\u201d\n\nWith operations in 12 US states, including its retail locations and 13 manufacturing facilities, Green Thumb is well positioned to take advantage of the expansion prospects in the US cannabis markets.\n\nStarting coverage of Green Thumb for Cowen in mid-September, 5-star analyst Vivien Azer specifically cites the company\u2019s high growth potential. She writes, \u201cWe believe the company's focused operating model that favors geographic depth, and a balanced revenue approach between wholesale and retail, gives GTI the most revenue and margin potential among our MSO coverage. GTI is our favorite name among the MSOs.\u201d Azer\u2019s $18.50 price target suggests an upside to this stock of 122%. Ms. Azer adds that Green Thumb is a \u201ccompelling buy,\u201d describing it as, \u201c\u2026currently trading at 4.2x FY20 revenue, which is a 22% discount to their MSO peers.\u201d (To watch Azer's track record, click here)\n\nThe company\u2019s low share price and high upside are key benefits for new investors looking to get in on that expansion. GTBIF sells for just $8.30 cents per share, and the average price target, $19.75, indicates room for 138% growth. Green Thumb\u2019s Strong Buy analyst consensus rating is based on a unanimous 7 buys assigned to the stock in the last three months.
