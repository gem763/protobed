The Nationals had not announced Corbin as their Game 3 starter, but it was widely assumed the 30-year-old would get the nod.\n\nAgainst Houston, Corbin threw 21 pitches.\n\nThe Nationals have used their starters throughout the postseason as relievers when needed. Entering Tuesday, manager Dave Martinez kept open the possibility that Corbin could make an appearance in the first two games out of the bullpen.\n\nWashington went to Corbin against the Astros as Scherzer threw 114 pitches through the first five innings. Martinez preferred using the left-hander for one inning over his relievers.\n\n\u201cAs the game was rolling along and I started watching Max\u2019s pitch count, I knew that there was going to become an inning that we need to use Corbin,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cAnd now all I wanted to do was pitch him an inning.\u201d\n\nAppearing on the 106.7 The Fan on Wednesday, general manager Mike Rizzo said Corbin\u2019s usage does not rule the pitcher out from starting Game 3.\n\nRizzo said Corbin pitching last night doesn\u2019t rule him out for Game 3. I still think that\u2019s who they go with Friday night. \u2014 Eric Bickel (@EBJunkies) October 23, 2019\n\nIf Corbin can\u2019t go, starter An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez would likely get the nod.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
