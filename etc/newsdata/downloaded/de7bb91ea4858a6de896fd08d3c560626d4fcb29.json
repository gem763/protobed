The airport is usually quiet at that time of day.\n\n\u201cA \u2018drone\u2019 aircraft was spotted in an area next to the airport,\u201d Dubai Media Office said in a statement, adding a reminder that drone use near airports was banned.\n\nThe UAE government media office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAuthorities temporarily grounded flights at Dubai International Airport in February, again due to suspected drones.\n\nDubai Airports has previously blamed drone incursions on leisure users unaware of the law or of how close they are to flying aircraft.\n\nIn July 2018 the UAE denied reports that Yemen\u2019s Iran-aligned Houthi movement had attacked Abu Dhabi airport with a drone, and said operations were unaffected.\n\nThe UAE is a leading partner in a Saudi-led coalition which has been fighting the Houthis in Yemen for more than four years.\n\nThe Houthis on Wednesday said it had dozens of targets in the UAE \u201cwithin our sight ... and can be attacked at any time\u201d.\n\nThis followed a Houthi claim that they carried out a major Sept. 14 attack on two Saudi oil plants with drones and cruise missiles that initially halved Saudi oil production.\n\nRiyadh says the attack could not have come from Yemen and, alongside Washington, blames Iran.\n\nIn December, major disruption was caused at London\u2019s Gatwick airport after drones were spotted near the airfield, raising concerns globally about the vulnerability of airports to unmanned aerial vehicles.", "description": "Two flights were diverted from Dubai International Airport on Sunday due to suspected drone activity, the hub's operator said, at least the second disruption of its kind there this year.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
