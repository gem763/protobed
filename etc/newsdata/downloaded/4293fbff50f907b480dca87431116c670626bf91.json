We wanted bakers across Canada to know that even the folks inside the tent occasionally mistake salt for sugar, macarons are hard for everyone, and that the pressure of making a celebratory cake can cause even the most seasoned baker to crack. So we asked the bakers of Season 3 to describe their most epic baking fails.\n\nLiam\n\nSome of my most epic baking fails have been, by accident, putting from the salt canister instead of sugar, so like 2 cups of salt. Which, it still looked fine, but tasted revolting.\n\nSugar and salt, very easy to mix up if you're not careful. (Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nMary Lou\n\nIn the old days, it was bread. It took a long time to get a handle on bread. It would be too dense.\n\nAndrea\n\nMy most epic baking fail was when I first started. I was making an ice cream puree, and I dropped the measuring cup into the food processor. It exploded everywhere! I cried my eyes out, and then I called my husband like \"Can you come clean up my mess!?\" and I just ran out the door.\n\nJodi\n\nGenoise cake is, by far, the most epic of my baking fails. I went through about a hundred eggs trying to make it. I'm probably mispronouncing it too.\n\nColin\n\nI was making a giant cake for a celebration, and I did all the fillings, all the decoration, and then I did the sponge and it came out like a floppy, rubbery pancake, and I had a meltdown.\n\nIs there anything sadder than a failed cake? Probably, but we can't think of what it is. (Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nBetty\n\nMacarons. My biggest baking flop is macarons. It did not rise well. It did not have the little skirts, and it just did not cooperate.\n\nJay\n\nThere was a time about three years ago, when I was baking a two-tiered birthday cake for a friend, and I just hit a point where absolutely nothing goes right. The cake that I chose, no matter how I tried to bake it, it wouldn't rise, it would sink in the middle, and I could not get it to work. The third time, I could get it to a point where I could cut some of the cake off of it to get it level and try to ice it, but then the icing separated, and it was a disaster. I ended up chucking that one. On the fourth try, it finally did come together.\n\nChris\n\nMy most epic baking fail was probably when I used salt instead of sugar. It all ended up in the garbage, and I had to save my reputation three times over.\n\nNataliia\n\nWhen I tried to bake macarons the first time, it was excellent, but every time after that, I had a lot of failure. Then I had to study.\n\nMacarons are challenging, even for the best bakers.

It's like this magical thing where it happens every two years, like recurrently. I don't know what I do differently. But it will collapse, it will burn, it will not stay together.", "description": "In everyone\u2019s life, some cakes must fall", "authors": ["Cbc Life"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5250346.1565985306!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/184943741.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
