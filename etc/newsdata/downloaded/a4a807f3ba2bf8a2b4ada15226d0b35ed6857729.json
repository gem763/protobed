REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\nFortnite, which as of earlier this year had 250 million registered players here, has been down since Sunday, giving users no option other than staring at a black screen after a season-ending in-game event where its original island was sucked into a black hole.\n\nThe new version of the game features 13 new locations, water gameplay where characters can swim, fish and ride motorboats as well as new places to hide and a host of new avatars and guns.\n\nThe changes, hashtagged #FirstDrop, were received well by gamers, with \u2018Fortnite is back\u2019 trending on U.S. Twitter with 13 thousand tweets.\n\nNearly 80,000 tuned in to watch the new game being played live by gamer Turner \u201cTfue\u201d Tenney on video game live-streaming platform Twitch, less than two hours after its launch.\n\nFortnite and its early rival, Tencent-backed \u201cPlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds\u201d (PUBG), popularized an arena-style battle royale survival concept where 100 gamers are dropped onto an island to fight each other to the death.\n\nThe games are free to download and play but users pay for upgrades, like the \u201cskins\u201d displayed on characters. Fortnite raked in $2.4 billion in revenue in 2018, more than any other single title, according to Nielsen data.\n\nThe runaway successes of the games prompted Electronic Arts (EA.O) to launch its similarly-themed Apex Legends earlier this year and competition continues to mount.\n\nThe mobile version of Activision\u2019s (ATVI.O) long-running \u201cCall of Duty\u201d franchise launched on Oct. 1, and has already racked up 125 million unique downloads and more than $28 million in gross player spending, according to data website SensorTower.\n\nShares in Activision, EA and Grand Theft Auto-maker Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO.O) all inched higher in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Fortnite publisher Epic was worth $15 billion when it last raised capital from investors last year.", "description": "Epic Games' launched a \"Chapter 2\" reboot of its battle royale smash hit \"Fortnite\" on Tuesday, drawing the eyeballs of millions of gamers globally as it bid to halt defections to rivals \"Apex Legends\" and \"Call of Duty\".", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441116905&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E0XI-OCATC", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
