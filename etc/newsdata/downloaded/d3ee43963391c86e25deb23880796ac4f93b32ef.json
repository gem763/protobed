Photograph: Armando Franca/AP\n\nThe polls suggest his Socialist party (PS) will win the election but fall short of an absolute majority in parliament.\n\nSpeaking in Coimbra this week, Costa said his party had \u201ctorn down the wall of incommunicability\u201d between the Portuguese left and paved the way for the country\u2019s recovery.\n\nWithout the PS government, he added, Portugal would not have managed to \u201cturn the page on austerity, regain international credibility, maintain investor confidence, reduce inequalities and balance the books\u201d.\n\nCosta has argued that a \u201cstrong PS\u201d is needed to keep things on track and has warned that a surge in support for the Left Bloc could lead to the kind of impasse seen in Spain, where the socialist party\u2019s inability to reach a deal with the far-left, anti-austerity Unidas Podemos has triggered the country\u2019s fourth election in as many years.\n\nAndr\u00e9 Azevedo Alves, a political scientist at the Catholic University of Portugal and St Mary\u2019s University, London, said Costa\u2019s main domestic achievement has been to deliver four years of relatively stable government.\n\n\u201cMost people didn\u2019t think the government would last more than one or two years,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cPolitical stability is one of the big factors that Costa and the Socialists have on their side. There was also a very high level of scepticism about a socialist government, with parliamentary support from the far left, being able to comply with the public finance objectives established by the European Union.\u201d\n\nCosta\u2019s other successes include raising the minimum wage to \u20ac600 a month, reversing civil service cuts and reducing unemployment.\n\nExternally, added Azevedo Alves, Costa has been able to keep the traditional social democratic party as the main party \u201cat a time when the traditional centre-left parties are in deep trouble \u2013 or, in some places, have almost disappeared\u201d.\n\nDespite all the talk of the \u201cPortuguese miracle\u201d, however, Costa\u2019s administration has hardly been immune to criticism, mistakes, scandal or corruption.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Socialist party leader Ant\u00f3nio Costa during a political rally for the 2015 elections, after which he eventually took power. Photograph: Andre Kosters/EPA\n\nMarina Costa Lobo, a political scientist at the University of Lisbon, pointed out that the country\u2019s much-vaunted economic stability has come at a price: \u201c[Costa\u2019s] achievements on anti-austerity were achieved through pragmatism, which meant that public investment has decreased dramatically, with resulting difficulties in key areas of public policy like health, transport and others.\u201d\n\nUnderfunding of public services such as education and healthcare has provoked strikes and anger, while the government\u2019s handling of the 2017 forest fires that killed more than 100 people was bitterly criticised and led to the resignation of the interior minister.\n\nMeanwhile, Costa\u2019s former defence minister, Jos\u00e9 Azeredo Lopes, is to be tried over his alleged role in a suspected cover-up of a weapons theft at a military base two years ago.\n\nPerhaps most damaging of all though, are the corruption charges faced by Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates, Portugal\u2019s socialist prime minister from 2005 to 2011.\n\nHe is accused of pocketing \u20ac34m through top-level corruption and has been charged with corruption in public office, money laundering, forgery and tax fraud.\n\nS\u00f3crates has denied any wrongdoing, but corruption remains an issue for many Portuguese people. A recent survey by the European Council on Foreign Relations found that 64% of those polled see it as a significant problem for Portugal.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Former prime minister Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates\u2019 corruption charges have marred the Socialist party. Photograph: Reuters\n\n\u201cLarge segments of the electorate would regard Costa as skilled and politically able but perhaps not necessarily the most trustworthy leader,\u201d said Azevedo Alves.\n\n\u201cThat explains the socialists\u2019 substantial lead in the polls but their lack of a clear majority in parliament.\u201d\n\nIf, as expected, a majority eludes the socialists, they could reactivate the geringon\u00e7a, again relying on the support of the Left Bloc and Communist party from outside government.\n\nBut if the PS finds itself closer to a majority than had been anticipated, it could instead turn to the small but growing green People-Animals-Nature (PAN) party, which is less ideologically fixed than the far-left groups.\n\nWhatever happens, though, and despite the protests and scandals, Costa and his allies have shown that the geringon\u00e7a has evolved from being a punchline to a resilient and effective political machine.\n\n\u201cIt has worked well; it has produced political stability,\u201d said Costa Lobo. \u201cEconomics trumps policy overall and ensures the PS will win.\u201d\n\nAzevedo Alves also sees a definite shift in the public mood. \u201cIn 2015, people were thinking we\u2019ll be bankrupt again a year from now,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s an idea within a large sector of the electorate that things haven\u2019t been wonderful but they have gone pretty well. It has certainly all been above most people\u2019s expectations.\u201d", "description": "After four years of relative stability, Socialist leader Ant\u00f3nio Costa seeks re-election", "authors": ["Sam Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e15a7fbe7e732ad9b152062a41480289f43ef76f/0_265_5043_3025/master/5043.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a219f387d83e09411a1d304a347d9c1f"}
