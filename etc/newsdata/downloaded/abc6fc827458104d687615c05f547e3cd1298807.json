But Jack was a builder, he was optimistic and Jack and Jagmeet have similar progressive values that resonate in the province,\" said Marie Della Mattia, NDP campaign co-chair.\n\nSingh told the crowd of supporters he wants to build on Layton's vision for the province.\n\n\"Now is the time to establish a healthy relationship with Quebec,\" he said.\n\nFinal word on infrastructure projects\n\nSingh's proposals include giving Quebec the final word on environmental evaluations for major infrastructure projects on its territory, such as pipelines.\n\nHe would also allow the provincial government to apply Bill 101, Quebec's law to protect and strengthen the French language, to national companies with a presence in Quebec, such as banks and the telecommunications sector.\n\nAll of Canada's Supreme Court judges would be required to be able to read and speak in French.\n\nThe platform offers more money to Quebec cultural organizations, particularly those whose goal is to promote and protect the French language.\n\nSingh would allocate $73 million more to Quebec's immigration ministry. The funds would allow the province to invest in programs teaching French to and integrating newcomers. This program was announced last week.\n\nSway over trade deals\n\nNo unilateral agreements would be made with web giants to stream content in Canada without consulting with Quebec. The NDP also promises to make sure companies like Netflix pay federal taxes.\n\nThe NDP would consult with Quebec before signing major international trade agreements. Quebec dairy farmers were upset by the new Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement (new NAFTA) deal signed in 2018, which allowed more American milk products into the country.\n\nQuebec support for the NDP has been eroding since Jack Layton's Orange Crush in 2011 when they took 59 of the 78 seats.\n\nUnder Tom Mulcair's leadership the party was reduced to 16 MPs in 2015. Singh's team is focusing on how Layton won over Quebecers.\n\nThe choice of Sherbrooke to make the announcement is symbolic. It's where Layton presented the party's position on asymmetrical federalism, recognizing Quebec's specific character.", "description": "New Democratic Party Leader Jagmeet Singh is promising more powers to Quebec on portfolios including the environment, language, immigration and justice.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5273641.1568587951!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/fedelxn-ndp-20190905.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
