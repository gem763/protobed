Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) listens as President Trump speaks during a meeting with lawmakers about trade policy. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nAnother potential scandal has cast a pall over Trump\u2019s presidency, and as has become a learned behavior in the Republican Party, the vast majority of GOP officials are declining to speak out against him.\n\nBut their non-responses also speak volumes.\n\nAfter a whistleblower complaint released Thursday alleged President Trump\u2019s misdeeds with regard to Ukraine, reporters set about getting reaction from Republican elected officials. They ran into a stone wall.\n\nAs CNN\u2019s Ted Barrett summarizes, many Republican senators claimed they hadn\u2019t even read the relatively brief document, despite it having consumed the political world. But even those who said they had weren\u2019t ready to completely dismiss the idea that there\u2019s something amiss here.\n\nA sampling from Barrett\u2019s report:\n\nThe responses from GOP senators were, as is typical of the upper chamber, somewhat more cautious than from other Republicans. Some of them reportedly even said they were declining to comment because they might one day be jurors at an impeachment trial in the Senate (which is a pretty amazing response).\n\nBut even considering that, the non-responses are unusual and remarkable. The GOP response de rigueur before midweek was to ignore questions about whether Trump did anything wrong and emphasize that his concerns about Joe and Hunter Biden\u2019s actions in Ukraine were warranted \u2014 suggesting the whole thing was just about getting Ukraine to root out actual, real corruption.\n\nThat seemed to shift Thursday though, especially in the Senate, where Republicans seemed genuinely gun-shy about mounting anything like real defense of Trump. A few of them have criticized Trump for his Ukraine interference, including Sens. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) and Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.), the last of whom called Trump\u2019s call with Ukraine\u2019s president \u201cinappropriate\u201d but not impeachable. Yet the rest of them don\u2019t really seem to comfortable firmly taking the other side: that this is a nothingburger.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult not to read that as evidence of genuine concern about what lies ahead. Even if Republicans truly think nothing bad happened \u2014 or that it wasn\u2019t bad enough to cause the party problems \u2014 there is so much we don\u2019t know at this point. And judging by Trump\u2019s behaviors in the past, do any of them really want to gamble that what eventually comes out won\u2019t make their initial defenses look foolish? We have a president who on that call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky talked about all the United States does for Ukraine, and then immediately launched into asking for a \u201cfavor,\u201d before pushing for two specific investigations that carry obvious domestic political benefits for him. Even if there may never be an explicit quid pro quo, Trump was unquestionably asking for foreign assistance in his reelection campaign.\n\nThe whistleblower also alleges relatively widespread concern within the administration and even a coverup attempt involving trying to bury the rough transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky. They said it was put on a codeword-level computer system that is intended for sensitive national security information \u2014 not politically sensitive materials.\n\nWhile we don\u2019t know much, there are plenty of obvious avenues for investigation here. And for a president who was doing all this literally as the Robert S. Mueller III-Russia situation was wrapping up, it suggests he wasn\u2019t overly careful.\n\nThe best GOP pushback against the whistleblower at this point appears to be that their information is \u201csecondhand,\u201d which it is. Any time a witness to something is getting their information from someone else, it is subject to other people\u2019s faulty recollections, misunderstandings and misinterpretations. We shouldn\u2019t assume all of it is true.\n\nBut what we do know \u2014 the Trump-Zelensky call \u2014 is very accurately summarized in the complaint, despite the whistleblower not having been on it. And the whistleblower says they verified their secondhand allegations with multiple U.S. officials. Their understanding of intelligence matters and classification rules also suggest they are hardly a novice. And it is an intelligence official\u2019s job is to carve through misinformation to find the truth.\n\nFor all those reasons, it shouldn\u2019t be surprising that top Republicans aren\u2019t leaping to Trump\u2019s defense. Romney said it well the other day, when explaining why Republicans weren\u2019t criticizing Trump.\n\n.@MittRomney @ The Atlantic Festival on why he's the only GOPer voicing concern over Trump's call:\n\n\n\n\"I think it\u2019s very natural for people to look at circumstances and see them in the light that\u2019s most amenable to their maintaining power, and doing things to preserve that power\u201d \u2014 Kathryn Watson (@kathrynw5) September 25, 2019\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very natural for people to look at circumstances and see them in the light that\u2019s most amenable to their maintaining power, and doing things to preserve that power,\u201d Romney said at the Aspen Festival.\n\nThe fact that these Republicans can\u2019t yet see this in such a favorable light \u2014 and apparently don\u2019t think leaping to Trump\u2019s defense is a good move when it comes to preserving their power \u2014 speaks volumes.", "description": "Many of them said they hadn't even read the report or were reserving judgment.
