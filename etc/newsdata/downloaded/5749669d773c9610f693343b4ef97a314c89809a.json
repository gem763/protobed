Biden\u2019s offensive on Saturday was intended to push back on any media attempt to equate Trump\u2019s alleged actions with that of Biden or his son\u2019s.\n\nTrump has claimed that as vice president Biden demanded Ukraine fire a state prosecutor who was investigating a gas company where Biden's son held a board position. Multiple news organizations this week reported that Trump had repeatedly pressed Ukrainian authorities to investigate the allegations in a phone call.\n\nPart of the strategy quickly emerging from the Biden camp on Saturday was to forcefully push back on any media attempts to further probe Hunter Biden\u2019s contracts with Ukraine rather than putting the focus squarely on the president.\n\n\u201cYou should be looking at Trump,\u201d Biden snapped. \u201cEverybody looked at this and everybody who\u2019s looked at it said there\u2019s nothing there. Ask the right question.\u201d\n\nA memo from the Biden campaign on Saturday offered the same sentiment, closing with a boldface statement that offered up a warning.\n\n\u201cAny article, segment, analysis and commentary that does not demonstrably state at the outset that there is no factual basis for Trump\u2019s claims, and in fact that they are wholly discredited, is misleading readers and viewers.\u201d\n\nThe offensive is a sign Biden\u2019s campaign \"learned an important lesson from 2016,\" said Karen Finney, a former spokeswoman for Hillary Clinton.\n\n\"They recognize that after three years of this, it's not that people are complacent, but they're worn out and our ability to be shocked has gone down,\u201d she said. \u201cSo they're right to say, 'no, this is not normal, this is not ok.'\"\n\n\"It's important we don't let this become a false equivalency, so it's wise on their part to do this,\u201d Finney said.\n\nTalk of Trump\u2019s conversations with Ukraine served as a backdrop throughout Saturday\u2019s steak fry, where a record 12,200 people turned out to what\u2019s typically a light-hearted political event filled complete with sign wars, rallies, and a steady stream of political speeches.\n\nBut 2020 candidates were asked to weigh in all day about Ukraine and the president, even if by doing so they risked framing Biden as Trump\u2019s chief opponent. The dynamic meant at least some of the day\u2019s focus shifted to Biden, with his competitors piling on the president. And even as Biden donned an apron and grilled a steak, one of his top surrogates, Sen. Chris Coons, could be heard answering reporter questions about the implications of the ordeal.\n\n\u201cHow many crimes does this president have to commit before this Congress acts and impeach him?\u201d Julian Castro said as he opened his remarks.\n\n\u201cI did not think that Donald Trump could shock me anymore, but this behavior is stunning,\u201d Sen. Cory Booker told reporters when asked about Trump and Ukraine, adding that it was \u201ca betrayal of our nation.\u201d\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren over social media called Congress \u201ccomplicit\u201d by failing to begin impeachment proceedings against Trump. But reporters still later asked her to weigh in about the president\u2019s conversations about Biden\u2019s son.\n\n\u201cWhat the president has now demonstrated is that he thinks it's pretty clear he doesn't have to follow the law, and in fact, can continue to commit high crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d Warren said. \u201cHe can go back to the well and do exactly what he did before, and that is invite and profit from foreign interference in our election.\u201d\n\nPatti Solis Doyle, who served as a senior campaign adviser to Hillary Clinton, said the focus on Biden could send the message to primary voters that he\u2019s who Trump most fears.\n\n\u201cIt reframes the race into Trump vs. Biden instead of Biden vs. every other Democrat. And that\u2019s good for Biden,\u201d Solis Doyle said. \u201cBut it also brings back headlines on Hunter Biden, and I\u2019m sure Vice President Biden doesn\u2019t want that.\u201d", "description": "While media coverage over his dealings with Ukraine is swamping Trump, it also has singed Biden\u2019s son and is raising questions about Biden\u2019s campaign for president.", "authors": ["Natasha Korecki", "Elena Schneider"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Dou6QS5Ir7rkD0BqDiEgkw--~B/aD03NzM7dz0xMTYwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/politico_453/e1c38591fe1d7f1f272172de339aa42a", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
