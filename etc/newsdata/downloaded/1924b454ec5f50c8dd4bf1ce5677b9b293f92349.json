Now the president appears intent on preventing his 2020 Democratic challenger from framing the issue as an unfulfilled promise.\n\nSUPREME COURT GIVES WH GREEN LIGHT TO ENFORCE ASYLUM RESTRICTIONS\n\n\"The Wall is going up very fast despite total Obstruction by Democrats in Congress, and elsewhere,\" Trump tweeted.\n\nTrump promised to have close to 500 miles of wall along the 1,954-mile-long border with Mexico. The U.S. Supreme Court in July cleared the way for about $2.5 billion to be used from a Pentagon counter-drug program.\n\nThe Trump administration says the wall is important in keeping out people who cross illegally.\n\nCritics say a wall is useless. They say most of those apprehended turn themselves in to Border Patrol agents in the hope they can be eventually released while their cases play out in immigration court.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a top 2020 Democratic hopeful, said on Twitter in March that the border wall is not about security. She said, \u201cit\u2019s a monument of hate and division, and I won\u2019t support it.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court on Wednesday also issued an order against lower court injunctions that blocked the White House\u2019s ban on asylum for anyone trying to enter the U.S. by traveling through a third country. The order was not the final ruling but was seen as a victory for Trump. Only liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented.\n\nVictor Manjarrez Jr., a former Border Patrol chief who\u2019s now a professor at the University of Texas, El Paso, spoke to the Associated Press and said tall border fencing is crucial in some areas and less helpful in others, like remote stretches of desert where shorter barriers and more technology like ground sensors would suffice.\n\nHe said building 450 to 500 miles of fence by the end of next year would be tough if that figure doesn\u2019t include sections of the wall that have been built recently.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cAs it stands now, contractors are building pretty fast,\u201d Manjarrez said. The real question is whether the government needs to build that much fencing, he said.\n\nFox News' Gregg Re and the Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "President Trump on Wednesday expressed optimism in his effort to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and said recent court victories will help pave a way around \u201cobstructionist Democrats.\u201d", "authors": ["Edmund Demarche", "Edmund Demarche Is A News Editor For Foxnews.Com.
