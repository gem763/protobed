The company has been in close contact with the Federal Aviation to have the plane recertified in a process that has dragged out much longer than initially expected.\n\n\u201cOur entire Boeing team is focused on operational excellence, aligned with our values of safety, quality and integrity and we\u2019re committed to delivering on our commitments and regaining trust with our regulators, customers and other stakeholders,\u201d Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said in a statement.\n\nMuilenburg was stripped of his title as chairman earlier this month but kept on as CEO and a board member. McAllister is the most senior figure to exit Boeing in the wake of the crisis.\n\nBoeing has faced new scrutiny following the disclosure of text messages between two Boeing pilots in 2016 that suggested the company was aware of problems with a flight handling system that has been blamed for both crashes.\n\nShares rose 2.3 percent in afternoon trading to $338.60, recovering some of the losses since disclosure of the text messages led to deep declines the last two days.", "description": "New York (AFP) \u2013 Boeing on Tuesday replaced the head of its commercial plane division, the most significant executive departure since the 737 MAX", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/22/c89830_top-selling-boeing-737-max-jet-airliner-has-grounded-mid-two-crashes-killed-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
