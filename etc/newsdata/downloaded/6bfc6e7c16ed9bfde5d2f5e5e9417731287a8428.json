In the coming week, three market leaders are showing the right kind of stuff on the price chart to afford technical-based \u201cbuy\u201d ratings in front of the news.\n\nAny investor with even a passing interest in the market knows earnings can be a powerful catalyst on a stock\u2019s share price. Growth play and over-the-top streaming hardware top dog Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) jumped nearly 21% following July\u2019s report. What\u2019s more, in the two periods prior ROKU stock soared 28% and 25%, respectively. But stocks to buy for an earnings release are rarely that consistently generous.\n\nMarket sentiment, quarterly results \u2014 both on an absolute basis as well as compared to consensus and whisper views \u2014 and guidance from the company all play key factors in how investors react to earnings. And which of those influences holds the most weight with any given report can be elusive until after the fact. Still, it\u2019s not time to simply put the cash under the mattress when it comes to stocks to buy in front of earnings.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith caveats in place, when a company is a market or industry leader, has proven earnings power and has constructively put in the time on the price chart, earnings can act as a positive catalyst. And right now three stocks of this caliber are in our sights for this type of investment opportunity.\n\n\n\n\n\nStocks to Buy: Microsoft (MSFT)\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the first of our stocks to buy in front of earnings. The tech giant has been firing on all cylinders the last couple years and there\u2019s little reason to think this bullish trend won\u2019t continue. MSFT earnings are slated for next Thursday evening.\n\nSince reporting last quarter, shares of Microsoft are up about 4.5%. That leadership from the world\u2019s largest company compares favorably to the broad-based S&P 500\u2019s flat performance over the last three months. But the story for MSFT stock gets even better on the price chart.\n\nOver the last six months shares of Microsoft have established a solid base-on-base pattern. There was an ill-timed breakout attempt from the pattern in September as the market began to aggressively selloff. Now after pulling modestly back within the base to form a confirmed weekly doji low with a supportive-looking bullish stochastics setup, MSFT is a stock to buy today.\n\n\n\n\n\nAT&T (T)\n\nAT&T (NYSE:T) is the next stock to buy. For many investors T is a widows-and-orphans stock with its defensive business and hefty yield of around 5.5%. But today\u2019s AT&T is much more.\n\nT stock has aggressively reshaped its business to grow and compete in today\u2019s market against competition from Disney (NYSE:DIS), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). And it\u2019s my guess T earnings are going to make good on recent relative strength. Plus it has a flat base or high handle formation which has followed a massive corrective cup-shaped base.\n\nBuying T stock in front of earnings is simple. I\u2019d recommend waiting for shares to trade above nearby pattern resistance of $38.22. With the company set to report on Oct. 28, my guess is the early bird will get the worm. The earnings reaction should fuel additional gains from this key breakout.\n\neBay (EBAY)", "description": "Knowing which stocks to buy in front of earnings can be dicey business.
