In 2006, Lukashenko was subjected to U.S. sanctions, which remain in place.\n\nAmid rising tensions in recent months with his main ally and patron, Russia, Lukashenko has sought to rebuild ties with the U.S. and Europe. Moscow has pushed for closer links under a longstanding agreement to form a union state, but Minsk has been reluctant to give in too much to its much larger neighbor. The U.S., meanwhile, has sought to limit Russia\u2019s sway over its neighbors.\n\nHale said the U.S. strongly supports Belarus\u2019 sovereignty and independence. Lukashenko told the U.S. diplomat he wouldn\u2019t allow the deployment of short- or medium-range missiles in his country -- something Russia has suggested it might do in response to threatened U.S. military moves in Europe -- but only if doing that didn\u2019t undermine Belarus\u2019 security.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Aliaksandr Kudrytski in Minsk, Belarus at akudrytski@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Balazs Penz at bpenz@bloomberg.net, Gregory L.
