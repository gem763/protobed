I understand that part,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cBut the way Trump did this, make no mistake who wins here: his buddy Vladimir Putin, who yesterday met with Erdo\u011fan to carve up Syria like a Christmas shawarma.\u201d\n\nNaturally, Trump gave a self-congratulatory victory speech from the White House on Wednesday, where he said the ceasefire in Syria would be permanent, \u201chowever you define the word permanent in that part of the world\u201d.\n\nStephen Colbert: 'We now have solid evidence of the crime Trump already confessed to' Read more\n\nColbert translated in the president\u2019s voice: \u201cWe have achieved permanent peace, by which I mean a very temporary peace. That is my promise, by which I mean my suggestion, really just spitballing here. Point is, war\u2019s over, let\u2019s go forcibly kiss a nurse in Times Square.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust remember, when you write it down in the history books,\u201d Colbert continued as Trump, \u201cit was my idea and mine alone to give Turkey and Russia everything they want.\u201d\n\nSamantha Bee\n\nOn Full Frontal, Samantha Bee dove headfirst into the impeachment inquiry engulfing Trump\u2019s presidency, starting with the testimony on Tuesday of America\u2019s top diplomat to Ukraine, Bill Taylor. Taylor offered \u201cthe strongest evidence we\u2019ve seen that Trump really did pressure Ukraine to investigate his rivals since Mick Mulvaney went on TV and admitted it\u201d, said a frustrated Bee.\n\nTo recap, Taylor provided detailed notes on Trump\u2019s attempts to pressure Ukraine into investigating Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Bee offered a \u201ccomprehensive explainer\u201d of the Biden-Ukraine scandal: \u201cIt\u2019s bullshit.\n\n\u201cI mean, don\u2019t get me wrong,\u201d she continued. \u201cThere are plenty of reasons to criticize Joe Biden, from his treatment of Anita Hill to his vote for the Iraq war to allegations that he inappropriately touched a train. But the Ukraine story is not one of them because there is no evidence that either Biden did anything illegal in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nSo where did Trump get his crazy idea? According to Bee, from rightwing author Peter Schweizer, whose recent book introduced the Biden-Ukraine conspiracy theory.\n\n\u201cIn his recent books, Schweizer comes off as relatively sane by rightwing crackpot standards,\u201d explained Bee. \u201cThat is not a coincidence.\u201d A friend of the former White House adviser Steve Bannon, Schweizer has \u201cdevised a clever way to use the mainstream media against liberal politicians: just gather a bunch of provocative but unrelated facts about a Democrat, and pretend they point to a nefarious plot that\u2019s completely unsupported by those facts,\u201d Bee said.\n\n\u201cThen, instead of feeding them into the rightwing media fever swamp, feed them into respectable mainstream outlets that in their desperate quest for balance, will investigate, promote and legitimize the story, allowing it to spew all over the news ecosystem.\u201d\n\nBannon called this system of information \u201canchor left, pivot right \u2013 which is also his system for putting on his human suit in the morning\u201d, Bee joked.\n\nThis system worked, Bee said, in the case of Schweizer\u2019s 2016 book Clinton Cash, which made baseless claims about the Clinton Foundation\u2019s finances and spawned mainstream media coverage.\n\nSchweizer probably has plans for 2020, said Bee, and she had a message for the media: \u201cStop letting this guy jerk you around with empty innuendo.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to cover stories that aren\u2019t true. It\u2019s a reckless, unprofessional, offensive choice you\u2019re making.\u201d\n\nSeth Meyers\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s long been a belief in the political world that somehow Donald Trump is untouchable, that somehow he never pays a political price for anything and that nothing can ever hurt him,\u201d said Seth Meyers on Late Night.\n\nStill, \u201cit really feels like we\u2019re seeing a potentially major political shift,\u201d said Meyers, who referenced a CNN poll unveiled on Wednesday that found a full 50% of Americans supported Trump\u2019s removal from office, the highest number yet.\n\nAnd there have been cracks in his support among congressional Republicans. On Sunday, the Utah senator Mitt Romney said in an interview: \u201cWe certainly can\u2019t have presidents asking foreign countries to provide something of political value. That is, after all, against the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, it is, and I can\u2019t believe that even has to be said,\u201d Meyers responded. \u201cIt\u2019s like if you were doing 120 on the highway while snorting cocaine, drinking tequila and mooning other drivers and a cop pulled you over and said, \u2018public nudity is, after all, against the law.\u2019\u201d\n\nSome Republicans are still backing the president, though. On Wednesday, two dozen House conservatives stormed a secure deposition room to protest against the impeachment inquiry, a scene Meyers likened to \u201ca protest outside a pharmacy that ran out of Viagra\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be at the Capitol \u2013 they should be standing at a McDonald\u2019s demanding to see the manager.\u201d", "description": "Late-night hosts assess another bewildering day in US news, from Trump\u2019s Syria speech to Republicans storming Congress", "authors": ["Adrian Horton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a309fda764876efb35334d0d19929ccaa3897b6/149_0_1582_950/master/1582.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b1e04bbb9a1a4ad388bb1bb45136f38a", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
