But with more than 63 percent of votes counted, the Netanyahu-led right-wing bloc was, as expected, more or less even with Gantz\u2019s centre-left.\n\nWith no single-party majority in the 120-seat Knesset, or parliament, there will likely be weeks of coalition talks before a new government is formed.\n\nThe ballot\u2019s wildcard, former Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman, emerged as a likely kingmaker as head of the secular-nationalist Yisrael Beitenu party.\n\nLieberman has been pushing for a unity government comprised of the biggest parties. He declined to back Netanyahu\u2019s bid to form a narrow right-wing and religious coalition after an April election, bringing about Tuesday\u2019s unprecedented repeat vote.\n\nAddressing Likud party faithful, Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s longest-serving premier, sipped water frequently and spoke hoarsely. He made no claim of victory or concession of defeat, saying he would await final results.\n\nHis dead-of-night appearance was a far cry from his triumphant - and in the end premature - declaration five months ago that he had won a close election.\n\nGantz was more upbeat, telling a rally of his Blue and White party that it appeared \u201cwe fulfilled our mission\u201d, and he pledged to work towards forming of a unity government.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s time for the real race,\u201d he later told reporters.\n\nCALL FOR A UNITY GOVERNMENT\n\nCampaigns run by Likud and Blue and White pointed to only narrow differences on many important issues: the regional struggle against Iran, the Palestinian conflict, relations with the United States and the economy.\n\nAn end to the Netanyahu era would be unlikely to bring about a significant change in policy on hotly disputed issues in the peace process with the Palestinians that collapsed five years ago.\n\nBlue and White party leader Benny Gantz speaks at the party's headquarters following the announcement of exit polls during Israel's parliamentary election in Tel Aviv, Israel September 18, 2019. REUTERS/Corinna Kern\n\nBased on the partial vote count, Israel\u2019s main TV stations, Channel 12 and 13, projected Likud and Blue and White would each have 32 seats. With support from smaller, like-minded parties, each was projected to command a bloc of about 55 or 56, short of a majority.\n\nThat left Lieberman, whose party was forecast to win 9 seats. On Wednesday, he reiterated his call for a unity government but said he had not yet spoken to Gantz or Netanyahu.\n\n\u201cThere is only one option - a national unity government, a broad, liberal government, and we will not join any other,\u201d Lieberman told reporters.\n\nNetanyahu, who highlighted his close relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump during the campaign, said in his 3 a.m. speech at Likud election headquarters in Tel Aviv that he intended to establish a \u201cstrong Zionist government\u201d that would reflect the views of \u201cmany of the nation\u2019s people\u201d.\n\nGantz has ruled out joining an administration with Netanyahu if the Israeli leader is indicted on looming corruption charges.\n\nThe Joint Arab List made a strong showing in Tuesday\u2019s election and was projected to capture 12 seats in parliament, compared with 10 won by various Arab factions in April\u2019s election.\n\nThree corruption investigations and the Israeli attorney general\u2019s announced intention to charge him with fraud and bribery have also chipped away at Netanyahu\u2019s seeming invincibility, 10 years into consecutive terms as prime minister marked by a sharp focus on security that resonated with voters.\n\nSlideshow (22 Images)\n\nNetanyahu, 69, who can argue at a pre-trial hearing in October against indictment, has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nAn election loss could leave him more at risk of prosecution in the graft cases, without the shield of parliamentary immunity that his current political allies had promised to seek for him.\n\n(Graphic - Netanyahu's annexation plans, here)", "description": "Israel's election was too close to call on Wednesday, with a partial vote tally showing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tied with his main rival, former military chief Benny Gantz.", "authors": ["Jeffrey Heller", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431071450&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H06Y", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
