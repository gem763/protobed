(Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nIf I\u2019d told a buddy to hydrate (even if I knew what that meant, which I didn\u2019t) when I was growing up in Syracuse, N.Y., in the 1960s, he would have thought I was mocking him.\n\nA water break on the outdoor basketball court where we all hung out meant running to the fire station next to the playground and using the fountain. Better yet, if you had a dime or 15 cents, you could buy a Royal Palm soda.\n\nSoda is a dirty word today \u2014 both diet and sugared. So is plastic.\n\nHydration is everything. And now, everyone knows what it means.\n\nSo why the obsession with water? Entrepreneur Jonathon Perrelli is introducing an electronic smart bottle called LifeFuels that he hopes will do for hydration what Fitbit has done for walking.\n\n[Paying for college comes down to managing expectations, for both parent and child]\n\nLifeFuels, based in Reston, Va., uses cartridges to shoot peach, citrus or blackberry-acai flavoring, as well as vitamins and minerals, into its smart water bottle. The bottle syncs to an iPhone app to enable you to record your intake of fluids and nutrients such as potassium and sodium.\n\n\u201cPeople like data,\u201d Perrelli said. \u201cThey want customization, portability and the ability to understand why they feel the way they do. And they want to track it all.\u201d\n\nPerrelli has bet $1 million of his own cash and spent the better part of a decade on LifeFuels. After raising $25 million, the company is launching this month in league with its partner, Massachusetts-based beverage giant Keurig Dr Pepper. They hope the apparatus creates a new coolness vibe around healthful sports drinks.\n\nA week from turning 64, I am not the LifeFuels target audience.\n\nWhy do I need some motorized water bottle with its R2-D2 blinking lights and its spritzes? Why surrender the one-liter plastic bottle of Dasani water that I drink at my cubicle each day?\n\n\u201cAre you able to infuse vitamins into your Dasani bottle?\u201d Perrelli asked me. \u201cDo you know how many electrolytes you are taking? Are you aware of how many drinks you took yesterday?\u201d\n\n[Can the spurned oil sector stage a comeback with investors?]\n\nPoint taken. Though I do remember how many glasses of Macallan 18 I drank the other day.\n\nI don\u2019t know if anyone is going to get rich off this, but the spirited Perrelli thinks he is onto something.\n\n\u201cWe supply you with actionable insights,\u201d the 47-year-old entrepreneur said.\n\nHe has checked several boxes of importance to LifeFuels\u2019 target customer \u2014 an urban, eco-observant, health-minded consumer.\n\nFirst is hydration. Dehydration is a major cause of emergency room visits in the United States, Perrelli said. Drinking about two liters, or half a gallon, of water a day is a common recommendation.\n\nNext is data. LifeFuels works with smartphones, which gives millennials yet another reason to tap into their iPhones.\n\nThen there\u2019s sustainability. At $179 a bottle, you aren\u2019t going to cast the LifeFuels vessel into the trash. It should last for years and appeal to anyone who is against single-use plastic stuff.\n\n[Knight Kiplinger\u2019s 25-year plan: Build a town from scratch on the Florida coast]\n\nLifeFuels comes nicely packaged in a box that includes the 16.9-ounce bottle, a rechargeable base, an electric charger and an initial supply of three flavored fuel pods. There\u2019s also a series of slick online videos with instructions.\n\nLifeFuels is a direct-to-consumer product that goes on sale online Monday. The key to its success will be selling subscriptions to people so that they buy the pods on autopilot \u2014 at $9.99 a pod, or about 33 cents a serving \u2014 thus creating a stream of recurring revenue.\n\n\u201cFuel pod usage is important to our long-term success,\u201d Perrelli said.\n\nThe bottles are manufactured in China, and everything else is made in the United States, including the flavored fuel pods. The user screws a fuel pod into the base of the bottle and pushes a button to squirt enough concentrate for one serving.\n\nPerrelli has been a student of supply and demand, and of the psychology of marketing, since he was a youth growing up in Northern Virginia, where he first sold candy to fellow students and then graduated to fireworks. He pocketed $7,000 one summer on a $400 fireworks investment.\n\n\u201cFireworks had insane margins,\u201d Perrelli said. \u201cEntrepreneurship has always been part of who I am.\u201d\n\n[Woodworkers transform salvaged logs into high-end furniture]\n\nHe used the cash to buy his first stocks, in General Motors and Coca-Cola. (I own Coca-Cola shares.)\n\nPerrelli graduated from Virginia Tech in 1995 with a degree in finance, and he has had several hits and a few misses in a quarter-century of investing.\n\nThe first home run came after four years at Northern Virginia-based UUNet, an early Internet service provider where Perrelli was employee No. 238 in a workforce that grew to more than 12,000.\n\nHe made $1 million from its stock in a few years, and he used the cash to dabble in real estate and buy stakes in several start-ups, including eTantrum, Plesk, Shadow Group and Social Tables.\n\nIn eight years or so, Perrelli has made more than 35 investments through Fortify, a small-seed venture capital firm begun in 2011. Perrelli said 20 of those start-ups failed, nine broke even or made a profit for investors, and 10 are still active investments awaiting an outcome.\n\n[Picking stocks, like picking ballplayers, can get complicated]\n\nInvesting success often comes down to timing.\n\n\u201cA brilliant idea at the wrong time is destined to fail,\u201d Perrelli said.\n\nHe thinks he has the timing \u2014 and the target customer \u2014 just right for LifeFuels. The idea came to him in 2006, when Perrelli\u2019s then-wife was pregnant with their third child.\n\n\u201cShe was having a challenging time staying hydrated and consuming the recommended nutrients and vitamins,\u201d Perrelli said.\n\nHe began monitoring her water consumption, first with Post-it notes and then with a computer spreadsheet. Sensing a business there, he started noodling with ideas and arrived at an early concept of the LifeFuels bottle.\n\nIt took eight years to turn the idea into reality as he began researching the beverage, health, consumer-electronics and app-development industries.\n\n[This no-nonsense consultant rules at turning homes into irresistible must-haves]\n\n\u201cI picked up the idea again in 2014 when smartphones had become commonplace and all things fitness were ripe for tracking,\u201d Perrelli said.\n\nBy January 2016, he had developed the prototype for a smart nutrition bottle and headed to Las Vegas for the annual CES.\n\n\u201cWe were definitely onto something,\u201d he said, but he continued to refine the bottle with a British design firm that had decades of experience with consumer products. He found talented engineers and beverage scientists, including a Pepsi expert, who also helped develop the bottle and fuel pods.\n\nBy January 2018, Perrelli had enough working nutrition bottles to return to the CES and audition before investors. Keurig\u2019s executive team followed up with a visit to Reston, and the two sides developed a strategic partnership, including funding and patents.\n\n[He wants to open up the e-suite beyond the chosen few]\n\nLifeFuels now has a full-scale bottle-manufacturing line in China. It recently finished a pilot program that tested the product with more than 300 investors, friends and family members.\n\nI asked some of my 20- and 30-something colleagues what they thought. The results were mixed. Some didn\u2019t like the taste. One colleague said the $179 bottle was too expensive. Another said he was going to buy a LifeFuels bottle for his mother, who pays close attention to her water intake.\n\nAs for me, I still quaff my daily liter of Dasani. And I am not swearing off my occasional indulgence in a 20-ounce sugary Coke or Mountain Dew.\n\nWhat\u2019s the point of life if you can\u2019t kick back with a soda pop. I wish I could relax with a Royal Palm orange, but I haven\u2019t seen the brand in decades.", "description": "Reston-based LifeFuels makes flavors and nutrients part of a high-tech hydration system.", "authors": ["Thomas Heath", "Local Business Reporter", "Columnist", "Writing About Entrepreneurs", "Companies In The Washington Metropolitan Area", "September At Am", "Thomas Heath Is A Local Business Reporter", "Various Companies Big", "Small In The Washington Metropolitan Area.
