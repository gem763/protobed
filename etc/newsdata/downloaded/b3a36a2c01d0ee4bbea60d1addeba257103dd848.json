Let's drill down on our favorite charts and see if we can propose a new strategy.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of MS, below, we can see that prices have gapped above the bottoming 200-day moving average line. The slope of the shorter 50-day moving average line has turned positive.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has made a higher low and is very close to making a higher high which tells us that buyers of MS have been more aggressive.\n\nThe trend-following Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator gave a cover shorts buy signal and is about to cross the zero line for an outright buy signal.\n\nAll this is a big change from August when prices were breaking the lows of 2019.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of MS, below, we can see that prices (when they are updated on this weekly chart) are above the bottoming 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line has been improving irregularly since December and the MACD oscillator is likely to cross to the upside when Friday's close is calculated.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of MS, below, we can see a potential upside price target of $53.\n\nBottom line strategy: Risking below $42, traders could go long MS at current levels and if there is a shallow dip the next day or two. Our price targets are $52 and then $60.", "description": "The charts and indicators are finally suggesting that a move higher is possible....MS", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "A New Bullish Technical Strategy On Morgan Stanley", "The Charts", "Indicators Are Finally Suggesting That A Move Higher Is Possible.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Timothy Collins", "Carolyn Boroden", "Bob Lang"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/3b6d1c74-a70d-11e8-992b-013b2953989d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
