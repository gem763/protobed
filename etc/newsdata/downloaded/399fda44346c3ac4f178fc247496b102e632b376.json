It\u2019s low-speed Autonomous Emergency Braking system didn\u2019t meet the mark either.'\n\nWhiplash tests now form a crucial part of Euro NCAP's safety tests, partly due to a hefty rise in whiplash injury claims a number of years ago.\n\nIn 2000 only 16 per cent of car seats were rated 'Good' for whiplash prevention, while by 2007 this figure had risen to 29 per cent. Today, the figure is closer to 100 per cent, according to Thatcham Research.\n\nAvery said: 'Whiplash is now a key part of carmaker safety strategy, and seats today are specifically designed to protect occupants\u2019 necks.\n\n'Although the whiplash results seen in this round of testing don\u2019t represent a significant backward step, the safety of rear seat occupants should remain a priority.'", "description": "The new Peugeot 208 narrowly missed out on a\u00a0maximum score, with a tester saying 'This goes to show how Euro NCAP ratings are driving an incredibly competitive safety market.'", "authors": ["Jane Denton For Thisismoney", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
