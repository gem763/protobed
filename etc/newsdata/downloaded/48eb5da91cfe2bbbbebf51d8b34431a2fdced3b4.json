All content that had been posted there will be deleted by mid-December, and although it will be available for download before the end comes, the site will be largely shuttered by the end of this month.\n\nBecause Yahoo didn\u2019t give the internet much warning, a lot of weird externalities of the company\u2019s decision are being worked out in public. One that\u2019s particularly surprising: the United Kingdom\u2019s phone system actually relies in part on a Yahoo group founded in 2002 \u2014 which I learned about through a tweet.\n\nToday it was announced that Yahoo! Groups is shutting down, and taking with it a piece of critical national infrastructure: the Oftel Yahoo Group which is used for managing UK phone number assignments.\n\n\n\nYes, really: See Ofcom's website https://t.co/zuT1fPIzka pic.twitter.com/RsPyGlwfxs \u2014 stressed depressed lemon zest (@erincandescent) October 16, 2019\n\n\u201cA review might consider whether it is befitting for the world\u2019s sixth largest economy to manage critical national infrastructure via a Yahoo group but we would hope that is obvious,\u201d reads the 2015 report referenced in the tweet, which was prepared by Simwood, a UK telecom, and sent to Ofcom \u2014 the UK\u2019s national telecom regulatory body.\n\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s phone system actually relies on a Yahoo group founded in 2002\n\nOfcom, otherwise known as the Office of Communications, is analogous to America\u2019s Federal Communications Commission. One of its roles is to manage telephone numbers in the UK. The organization allocates numbers in blocks of 10,000 to telecom companies, which then activate the numbers for use on their networks. Ofcom maintains an official database of those numbers on their website, which is available to the communications companies.\n\nOfcom isn\u2019t really involved with the Yahoo page itself, according to an organization spokesperson who wasn\u2019t authorized to speak on the record. The group is an informal way to tell other telecoms who has which numbers, they said, which is important because that determines how calls are routed and charged. Basically, Ofcom\u2019s position is that the group is unnecessary because they maintain their own database that\u2019s regularly updated with all the info that telecommunication companies might need.\n\nBut the Yahoo group may still be necessary to companies in the industry. Simon Woodhead \u2014 the CEO of Simwood, which wrote the 2015 report \u2014 said that the Yahoo group is useful for letting telecommunications companies know how those ranges of numbers have been distributed.\n\nApparently, there\u2019s not really a better way to let UK phone providers know which numbers belong to their competitors. \u201cThey would say the group is informal for operators to talk to each other and there is a database for managing numbers. That is correct, but slightly evasive,\u201d Woodhead said. \u201cIf you were to ask them what the formal process and means for operators to announce active number ranges to each other is, they wouldn\u2019t have an answer because the answer is the Oftel Yahoo group.\u201d (It\u2019s known as the Oftel Yahoo group because Oftel \u2014 or the Office of Telecommunications \u2014 was the organization that preceded Ofcom, and the Yahoo group precedes the creation of the UK\u2019s communications regulator.)\n\nWoodhead likened the Yahoo group to DNS\n\nEssentially, Ofcom manages the numbers that telecom companies like Simwood can get; they build those blocks of numbers that they have on their network, and afterward need to tell other telecom companies that those numbers that they received are ready for service, and where those numbers can be reached. This, Woodhead said, gets essential when you\u2019re talking numbers because you need to know where the numbers are. Simwood hosts number ranges for other operators, which is a problem because \u201cnowhere in Ofcom\u2019s database is that relationship recorded.\u201d\n\nOperators need to know where those numbers are hosted so they can route calls to them. \u201cThat\u2019s the purpose of the Oftel group,\u201d says Woodhead. \u201cSo we say \u2018Hey, this range from Fred Bloggs Limited is now live on the Simwood network. These are the points of interconnect on the BT network. If you\u2019ve got a bilateral with us then talk to us directly. And by the way, this is the test number.\u201d\n\nThe Yahoo group is also important because operators need to know how much to charge consumers for calls, because it\u2019s not obvious from the number range itself what the rate is going to be. The group facilitates that, by allowing operators to tell each other to update their rate sheets.\n\nWoodhead likened the Yahoo group to DNS, the Domain Name System, which is the internet system that associates information like IP addresses with domain names. \u201cLike, www.theverge.com points to a given an IP address,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat the Ofcom list does is say that \u201ctheverge.com\u201d has been registered. What it doesn\u2019t do is say what the IP address is.\u201d\n\nThe internet has its own protocols to make that happen. Voice communications, on the other hand, do not, which is where the Yahoo group comes in. \u201cIt says hey: theverge.com is now active on our network and this is the IP address.\u201d\n\nThe idea that at least some part of the UK\u2019s voice communication infrastructure rests on the framework of Yahoo Groups feels a little alarming; shouldn\u2019t phone numbers be easier to manage than the internet? But then: the infrastructure that underpins the stuff we use and take for granted every day is usually far weirder and more complicated than it seems at first.\n\nShouldn\u2019t phone numbers be easier to manage than the internet?\n\nYahoo plans to delete all of its uploaded group data \u2014 which includes files, photos, attachments, email updates, and message history, among other stuff \u2014 on December 14th. That may not entirely disrupt its usage by UK telecoms, though, as email functions are still supposed to work.\n\n\u201cMy understanding is that [the group] will still function as a mailing list, which is for all practical purposes, what people use this as,\u201d Woodhead says. \u201cBut quite frankly\u201d \u2014 and here he scoffs \u2014 \u201cthe world\u2019s fifth largest economy, or whatever we are now, relying on a Yahoo group to administer critical national infrastructure is embarrassing.\u201d", "description": "\"A review might consider whether it is befitting for the world\u2019s sixth largest economy to manage critical national infrastructure via a Yahoo group but we would hope that is obvious,\" reads the 2015 report referenced in the tweet, which was prepared by Simwood, a UK telecom, and sent to Ofcom.", "authors": ["Bijan Stephen", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ab7sKh17o1dIEItiP63RFWZ7W7Y=/0x144:2000x1191/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19224216/mb_yahoo_02.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
