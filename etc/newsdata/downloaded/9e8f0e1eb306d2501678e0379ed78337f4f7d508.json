Jerry Nadler (D-NY), first declaring an impeachment inquiry against Trump.\n\nRather, Pelosi put Schiff in charge of running the \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d and tasked the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, and Oversight Committees with investigating Trump.\n\nHouse Freedom Caucus and member of the Judiciary Committee Andy Biggs (R-AZ) said he tried to attend Wednesday morning\u2019s hearing with witness Michael McKinley, a career diplomat who recently resigned.\n\n\u201cChairman Schiff and Speaker Pelosi are intentionally running Soviet-style hearings to deprive the American people of representation,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nI was just denied access to Adam Schiff\u2019s secret chamber where he is running the unauthorized impeachment inquiry of @POTUS @realDonaldTrump.

Matt Gaetz (R-FL), another member of the Judiciary Committee, tried to attend a hearing but was similarly forced to leave. He told Breitbart News that it took 45 minutes for the House parliamentarian to review whether he could stay for the hearing, which Schiff said he would subtract from the time Republicans had to question the witness.\n\n\u201cThis is not a secret meeting to mark up an energy bill \u2014 this is a secret meeting to discuss and query the reversal of the will of the American people,\u201d he told Breitbart News.\n\nDemocrats are making up the rules as they go along. This was not a secret meeting to mark up an energy bill \u2014 this was a secret meeting to discuss and query the reversal of the will of the American people.https://t.co/QdBFVHG0gr \u2014 Rep. Matt Gaetz (@RepMattGaetz) October 14, 2019\n\nSchiff on Sunday defended his decision to keep the hearings secret from the American people, saying he feared that Republicans would defend the president and that witnesses could compare answers to each other. He also likened the secret hearings to a \u201cgrand jury\u201d \u2014 despite there being no crime involved.\n\nRepublicans also say that if the House holds a vote on the floor, it would trigger certain rights for Republicans, such as the ability to subpoena witnesses and afford more due process for the president.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) wrote in a letter to Pelosi:\n\nUnfortunately, you have given no clear indication as to how your impeachment inquiry will proceed \u2014 including whether key historical precedents or basic standards of due process will be observed. In addition, the swiftness and recklessness with which you have proceeded has already resulted in committee chairs attempting to limit minority participation in scheduled interviews, calling into question the integrity of such an inquiry.\n\nBut House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) on Tuesday called a full House vote authorizing the inquiry not necessary, according to Politico.\n\nThe outlet reported that Pelosi and other top Democrats could not come to an agreement among themselves during discussions on Monday over whether to move forward with a full House vote. They had reportedly reached out to the most vulnerable members of the Democrat caucus to see if they would support a formal vote to authorize an impeachment inquiry against Trump.\n\nThe idea has been met with anxiety among some of the battleground Democrats, who fear it could distract from the agenda, multiple aides told Politico.\n\nFollow Breitbart News\u2019 @Kristina_Wong.", "description": "Democrats on Wednesday continued their closed-door hearings in the Capitol building basement as part of their so-called impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Kristina Wong"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/schiff-wide-eyed-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
