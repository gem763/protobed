The best manes on show at the World Cup", "language": "en", "text": "Tokyo - There have been some hair-raising moments at Rugby World Cup 2019, and also some eyebrow-raising hairstyles.\n\nThat got the official RWC thinking about how a 1-15 of the most memorable hairdos on show in Japan might look.\n\nFRONT ROW\n\nIf you're hooking opposite Japan's Shota Horie, you might want to keep your mouth shut just in case his hair gets in there as well. Either side of him are the 'Blond Bangers' of England's Joe Marler and Isileli Nakajima of Japan.\n\nSECOND ROW\n\nYou would not want to meet these two in a dark alley, or lend them your shampoo. South Africa's RG Snyman and Evan Olmstead of Canada make for a fearsome engine room up front.\n\nBACK ROW\n\nIt's important to be flexible in modern rugby, so we have gone for a powerful, pacy, interchangeable back three of Canada's Lucas Rumball, Uruguay's Juan Ormaechea and Josh Navidi of Wales. Blindside, openside, we have it covered.\n\nHALFBACKS\n\nA scrumhalf's job is all about ensuring a smooth delivery to his flyhalf, and they do not come much smoother than South Africa's Faf de Klerk and outside him in this team is Tonga's Latiume Fosita.\n\nCENTRES\n\nNew Zealand's Jack Goodhue is invoking the spirit of the '70s, while Michele Campagnaro of Italy is invoking the spirit of the Milan catwalk.\n\nBACK THREE\n\nCanada's Jeff Hassler is less wing and a prayer, and more of a winger with a mass of hair. Jack Nowell appears to have stolen a bottle of peroxide. As for Japan's flyer Kotaro Matsushima, he has been one of the stars of the tournament, no doubt helped by that aerodynamic crop top.\n\nImages courtesy of the official 2019 Rugby World Cup site\n\nRead the full article on the official 2019 Rugby World Cup site", "description": "We highlight the best barnets, memorable mullets and magnificent manes on show at Rugby World Cup 2019.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9482/ac799cb8aa4a49f8a918784e4eec27ae.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
