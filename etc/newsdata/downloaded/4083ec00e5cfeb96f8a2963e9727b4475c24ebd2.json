Not only is it one of the six strongest hurricanes recorded in the Atlantic in the past 70 years, but meteorologists are finding its path very difficult to predict because of its wide \u201ccone of uncertainty\u201d. It is impossible to say just where the storm will hit \u2013 and with how much deadly force.\n\nWithin that fuzzy picture, Dorian has the potential to affect millions in the Caribbean and along the US coast. So what is the current thinking about its path?\n\nSunday\n\nWhat we know with certainty is that Dorian will hit the northern Bahamas as a category 5 hurricane, the most powerful on the Saffir-Simpson wind scale, with the potential to cause \u201ccatastrophic damage\u201d. It is expected to make landfall on the Abaco Islands, home to about 17,000 people, on Sunday afternoon and Grand Bahama (52,000) overnight and into Monday.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A handout photo made available by Nasa on 1 September shows Hurricane Dorian over the Atlantic Ocean approaching the Bahamas and Florida. Photograph: Nasa/Handout/EPA\n\nA Sunday morning update from the National Hurricane Center (NHC) in Miami painted a bleak picture. When a US air force plane specially designed for the purpose was flown through Dorian on Sunday morning, it recorded winds of almost 175mph.\n\nNHC later said Dorian was the strongest hurricane on record to hit the north-western Bahamas, with sustained winds of 180mph.\n\n\u201cThis is a life-threatening situation. Residents should take immediate shelter,\u201d the NHC warned. Winds could gust at more than 200mph and islanders could also have to contend with a storm surge of up to 23ft and rainfall of up to 30in in places.\n\nMonday\n\nThough the Bahamas will probably suffer the most devastation, the big question in terms of scale of potential human suffering is where and when Dorian will hit along the east coast of the US, where population density is so much greater. Here, projections become much less definitive.\n\nOn Sunday, the hurricane was moving at about 7mph in the direction of southern Florida. That slow speed made it all the more dangerous.\n\nBut at some point, probably later on Monday, Dorian is expected to veer towards the north-west, making a direct hit on the coast less likely.\n\nThe difficulty is that at this point the projected cone of the hurricane \u2013 the probable path of its center \u2013 becomes much wider, which renders its path less predictable. Latest projections show its likely trajectory as moving along the US coast and continuing to veer in a clockwise direction as it approaches Georgia and South Carolina, which would avoid the most catastrophic scenario of a direct landfall.\n\nFloridians not fazed as Hurricane Dorian\u2019s path keeps state guessing Read more\n\nInto Tuesday\n\nSuch is the awesome size and power of the hurricane, combined with its slow movement, that the NHC is warning that even if Florida does not experience a direct hit, the result could still be disastrous. The agency said hurricane conditions are possible in Florida by late on Monday and into early Tuesday morning.\n\nThe NHC also noted that hurricane-force winds of at least 74mph can be expected up to 45 miles from the center of the storm and tropical storm-force winds of up to 73mph up to 140 miles from it. That puts much of the Florida coast, and that of Georgia and South Carolina, in peril.\n\nA stretch of 150 miles of Florida coastline from the northern edge of Fort Lauderdale up to Brevard county was placed under warning that hurricane conditions are possible over the next 48 hours, even if Dorian tracks the coast without making landfall. The potential hazards include a storm surge of up to 7ft around Brevard county.\n\nTuesday and beyond\n\nThe further out the projection, the less certainty there is about Dorian\u2019s path and potential destruction. But the NHC is clear that danger will remain, stating: \u201cDorian is expected to remain a powerful hurricane during the next few days.\u201d\n\nThat will bring the coast of Georgia and South Carolina into the frame, with all the consequent risks of high winds, storm surges and flooding.", "description": "Dorian is one of the six strongest hurricanes recorded in the Atlantic, but meteorologists are finding its path difficult to predict", "authors": ["Ed Pilkington"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de3baa9f81bac086064cbc0ca31b3d026a57785f/0_189_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=db3eaadc5b90ec09a1f6671096c13062"}
