Getty\n\nThe former Vote Leave chief was appointed as a senior adviser to the prime minister in July.\n\nHe quickly became an unpopular figure on the opposition benches but was considered an invaluable strategist by Conservatives.\n\nMr Cummings had previously been found in contempt of parliament, for repeatedly refusing to appear before the Commons\u2019 inquiry into fake news.\n\nFollowing the appointment of Mr Cummings, the Liberal Democrats wrote to Sir Mark Sedwill, the UK\u2019s most senior mandarin, urging him to block it.\n\nBut the 47-year-old went on to play a key role in shaping the government\u2019s Brexit strategy.\n\nOn Tuesday, that strategy appeared to be in disarray, after MPs voted to seize control of the Commons agenda, paving the way for legislation blocking a no-deal Brexit to be passed.\n\nThe government was defeated by a margin of 328 to 301, with 21 Conservative MPs rebelling against the party.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Of course the PM takes responsibility \u2013 he\u2019s the big man and the buck stops with him \u2014 but we all know this is Cummings and [director of communications] Lee Cain.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve cooked up this strategy and they\u2019ve told him it\u2019s going to work and he\u2019s trusted them. And now we\u2019re throwing Winston Churchill\u2019s grandson out of the Conservative Party.\u201d\n\nMr Cummings is believed to have berated the rebels for an \u201cextended period of time\u201d while they waited to meet the prime minister earlier on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who any of you are,\u201d he said, according to The Huffington Post.\n\nThe senior adviser was later seen in the parliamentary press corridor, shortly before the vote.\n\n\u201cI just bumped into Dominic Cummings, who was clutching a glass of red wine and wandering along the parliamentary press corridor, lost and looking for a particular newspaper office,\u201d said Peter Walker, a political correspondent for The Guardian, on Twitter.\n\n\u201cThis is not a usual occurrence.\u201d\n\nAfter the result, Mr Cummings is said to have approached Mr Corbyn, who was leaving Portcullis House with members of his shadow cabinet.\n\n\u201cCome on Jeremy let\u2019s do this election, don\u2019t be scared,\u201d the 47-year-old shouted, according to a tweet posted by Tim Shipman, the political editor of The Sunday Times.\n\nThe journalist has since deleted his tweet.\n\nThe Independent understands that Mr Cummings approached the Labour leader and his cabinet ministers as they were leaving the building late on Tuesday evening.\n\nSources said the shout was not aggressive nor threatening and was merely boisterous. Mr Corbyn climbed into his car and did not respond.\n\n\u201cAs one of several shadow cabinet members stood right next to Jeremy (who was on the phone at the time) I just thought there was some loud bloke who stunk of booze yelling at us,\u201d said Cat Smith, the Labour MP, on Twitter.\n\nAsked if Mr Johnson was content with his adviser shouting at Mr Corbyn about whether he wanted an election, a Downing Street source said: \u201cIt\u2019s a perfectly legitimate question for the leader of the opposition to answer. The prime minister would very much welcome Jeremy Corbyn answering that question.\u201d\n\nThe source added that Mr Johnson \u201cdoesn\u2019t comment on his advisers\u201d.\n\nTuesday\u2019s vote has left the government with few options. Mr Johnson has said he will request an election under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, if legislation to block a no-deal Brexit is passed.\n\nBut it is unclear if he has the votes to call an early election under the act.\n\nThe easiest way to ensure one is for Mr Johnson to secure a two-thirds majority in the Commons.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats and the Conservative rebels have all indicated that they will not vote for an early election.\n\nMr Corbyn has said Labour will back an election after a no-deal Brexit is successfully blocked.\n\nIf an election is not called, Mr Johnson faces a difficult period as the prime minister of a weakened minority government, with a looming Brexit deadline and an unpopular senior adviser.\n\nMr Cummings\u2019 political affiliations have also been the subject of fevered speculation in Westminster.\n\nOn Tuesday the adviser was asked if he was a member of the Conservative Party and he refused to answer.\n\nHe gave a speech in 2017, in which he said: \u201cPeople think, and by the way I think most people are right, \u2018The Tory party is run by people who basically don\u2019t care about people like me.\u2019\n\n\u201cThat is what most people in the country have thought about the Tory party for decades. I know a lot of Tory MPs and I am sad to say the public is basically correct.\u201d\n\n\u201cTory MPs largely do not care about these poorer people. They don\u2019t care about the NHS. And the public has kind of cottoned on to that.\u201d\n\nThe aide\u2019s ambiguous political affiliation has triggered angry reactions in the Tory ranks.\n\n\u201cI think Mr Johnson\u2019s senior political advisor, Dominic Cummings, is in danger of tearing the party apart,\u201d Sir Roger Gale, Tory MP for North Thanet, told ITV News.\n\n\u201cI think that to have an unelected foul-mouthed oaf at the heart of Downing Street is dangerous and unacceptable.\"\n\nSir Roger said the aide should be \u201cfrogmarched out of Downing Street\u201d and claimed he had treated the Tory rebels in an appalling manner.\n\n\u201cThis is my party. I have been a member of this party for 45 years,\u201d former chancellor Philip Hammond said on Tuesday morning, hours before he was expelled.\n\n\u201cI am going to defend my party against incomers, entryists, who are trying to turn it from a broad church to narrow faction,\u201d he added, in a thinly veiled jab at Mr Cummings.\n\n\u201cPeople who are at the heart of this government, who are probably not even members of the Conservative Party, who care nothing about the future of the Conservative Party.\u201d\n\nMr Cummings has been contacted for comment.", "description": "Dominic Cummings is facing a growing backlash from all sides after Boris Johnson suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of rebel Conservatives.", "authors": ["Zamira Rahim"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/04/10/dominic-cummings-1.jpg"}
