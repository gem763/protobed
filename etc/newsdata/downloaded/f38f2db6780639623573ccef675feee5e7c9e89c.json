This is the second straight quarter in which Netflix has missed its subscriber growth projections.\n\nThe streaming giant said Wednesday that it signed up 517,000 new subscribers for the quarter ending in September, significantly off from the more than 800,000 that analysts had been expecting.\n\nWall Street investors look to Netflix\u2019s subscriber base as the key metric for the company\u2019s future profitability. As Netflix continues to borrow billions of dollars to finance its growing slate of original programming, it will depend on a growing customer base to eventually pay off that debt.\n\nBut the Netflix juggernaut is facing stronger headwinds. The streamer shocked Wall Street last quarter when it lost domestic subscribers for the first time in eight years, shedding a whopping 126,000 customers in the U.S.\n\nSome subscribers were turned off by higher prices. Netflix announced its highest price hike ever in January, raising the price of its most popular subscription package to $12.99 from $10.99.\n\n\u201cSince our U.S. price increase earlier this year, retention has not yet fully returned on a sustained basis to pre-price-change levels, which has led to slower U.S. membership growth,\u201d the company said in an investor note on Wednesday.\n\nConsumers will soon have cheaper streaming options at their fingertips. Disney+, which is set to launch next month, will only cost $6.99 a month and will feature movies and TV shows from the combined power of Disney and the recently acquired Fox.\n\nApple TV+ will cost even less at $4.99 a month, and is also set to launch next month, creating more competition for Netflix, which for years has easily dominated the streaming universe.\n\nNetflix has also alienated many conservative and right-of-center consumers with its close ties to former President Barack Obama, who signed a production deal with the streamer last year. Susan Rice, Obama\u2019s national security advisor, recently joined Netflix\u2019s board of directors.\n\nA survey last year by the research firm YouGov found that Netflix\u2019s positive impression rating with Republicans plummeted 16 percent since the beginning of 2018. Meanwhile, the company\u2019s positive impression rating among Democrats rose by 15 percent in the same period.\n\nDespite disappointing subscriber results, Netflix shares rose in after-hours trading Wednesday after the company reported quarterly earnings that exceeded guidance.\n\nNetflix said that upcoming releases including Martin Scorsese\u2019s acclaimed mob epic The Irishman and Noah Baumbach\u2019s intimate drama Marriage Story will help to strengthen its fourth-quarter results.\n\nFollow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg.
