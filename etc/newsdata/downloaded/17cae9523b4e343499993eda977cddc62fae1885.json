Mulvaney says $US391 million in military aid to Ukraine was held up partly over Trump's concerns about a Democratic National Committee (DNC) computer server alleged to be in Ukraine. \"The look back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the thing that he (Trump) was worried about in corruption with that nation,\" he says. \"The money held up had absolutely nothing to do with Biden.\" (AAP VIDEO/Supplied/White House)", "description": "Watch the Latest News.com.au Videos including Featured News Videos and Sports Videos and News Highlights.
