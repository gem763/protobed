Yung dapat barred from public service at makulong, yung may kaso ng plunder. https://t.co/ElFJ1YoS5i \u2014 Mar Roxas (@MARoxas) September 18, 2019\n\nRoxas\u2019 remark was an apparent response to Enrile\u2019s statement that Roxas and detained Senator Leila de Lima should be \u201cdisqualified forever from holding public office\u201d for the mess brought about by the implementing rules and regulations (IRR) they drafted for the Republic Act 10592 or the good conduct time allowance (GCTA) law.\n\nREAD: Enrile wants De Lima, Roxas perpetually barred from public office for GCTA mess\n\nEnrile earlier blamed Roxas and De Lima, then Justice Secretary, for the irregularities in the implementation of the law which led to the questionable release of 1,914 heinous crimes convicts since its enactment in 2013.\n\n\u201cThey should be disqualified forever from holding public office. Sila ang may kasalanan sila ang gumawa eh the people below them are being guided of what they did,\u201d Enrile said in a media interview at the Senate on Wednesday.\n\nThe former lawmaker said the law clearly states that convicts involved in heinous crimes are among those excluded from availing of the early release rule based on good conduct credits.\n\nEnrile said the IRR crafted by De Lima and Roxas, which supposedly added heinous crime convicts as GCTA beneficiaries, was \u201cunconstitutional and void ab initio (from the beginning).\u201d\n\nBut according to Roxas, the IRR faithfully reflects the RA 10592 and the Revised Penal Code, stressing that each provision corresponds to specific parts and paragraphs of the statute particularly on exclusion of inmates convicted of heinous crimes.\n\n\u201cAllegations that the IRR has strayed from the law on which it is based are unquestionably unfounded,\u201d Roxas explained in a letter responding to the Ombudsman\u2019s request on the matter.\n\nRoxas cited Rule 4, Section 6 of the law\u2019s IRR on provisional release while under preventive imprisonment, which states that: \u201cWhenever an accused has undergone preventive imprisonment for a period equal to the imposable maximum imprisonment of the offense charged to which he may be sentenced and his case is not yet decided, he shall be released immediately without prejudice to the continuation of the trial thereof or the proceeding on appeal, if the same is under review, except for the following: \u2018recidivist, habitual delinquent, escapee, person charged with heinous crimes\u2019.\u201d\n\nHere is the annex: pic.twitter.com/7O2qm1lTW7 \u2014 Mar Roxas (@MARoxas) September 18, 2019\n\nEnrile, 95, is facing a P172-million plunder charge before the Anti-Graft court in relation to the P10 billion pork barrel scam which involved businesswoman Janet Napoles and other public officials.\n\nHe is currently out of prison after the Supreme Court granted him temporary liberty in 2015 for humanitarian reasons.\n\nThe post Roxas tells Enrile: Public office ban is for those facing plunder charges appeared first on UNTV News.", "description": "MANILA, Philippines \u2013 Former Interior and Local Government Secretary Mar Roxas on Wednesday twitted former Senate President Juan Ponce Enrile, saying those accused of plunder or stealing from government coffers should be the ones banned from seeking or holding public office. \u201cAhem.
