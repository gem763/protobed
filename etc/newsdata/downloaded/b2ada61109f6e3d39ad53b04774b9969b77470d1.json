I know how hard you worked.\n\nI see this as an acknowledgment of what is possible when a woman is trusted to discern her own needs, feels safe enough to voice them, and respected enough that they'll be heard. When I asked for more dance classes, I heard, 'Yes.' More voice lessons? 'Yes.' A different wig, a pair of fake teeth not made out of rubber? 'Yes.' And all of these things, they require effort and they cost more money, but my bosses never presumed to know better than I did about what I needed in order to do my job and honor Gwen Verdon. And so I want to say thank you so much to FX and to Fox 21 Studios for supporting me completely and for paying me equally because they understood that when you put value into a person, it empowers that person to get in touch with their own inherent value and then where do they put that value? They put it into their work.\n\nAnd so the next time a woman \u2014 and especially a woman of color, because she stands to make 52 cents on the dollar compared to her white male counterpart \u2014 tells you what she needs in order to do her job, listen to her, believe her. Because one day, she might stand in front of you and say thank you for allowing her to succeed because of her workplace environment and not in spite of it.\n\nRead More", "description": "In her Emmys speech, Williams said a woman should succeeed \"because of her workplace environment and not in spite of it.\"", "authors": ["Sandra Gonzalez"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190922205739-michelle-williams-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
