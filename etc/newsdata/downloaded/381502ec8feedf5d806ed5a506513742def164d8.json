Circuit has found that a former IRS attempt to hinge exemption on a group\u2019s presentation of \u201ca sufficiently full and fair exposition of the pertinent facts as to permit an individual or the public to form an independent opinion or conclusion\u201d was unacceptably vague in scope and application.\n\nMoreover, if the IRS were to begin revoking groups\u2019 tax exemptions based on their exercise of speech that is not protected, such as libel or incitement of immediate criminal conduct, it would be obliged to apply such a policy neutrally as to content \u2014 which means a lot of groups quite different from the one targeted in the test-case controversy will find their ox gored. The legal precedents have developed in cases involving a wide range of both progressive and conservative litigants, and understandably so, because if principles in this area are to be principles they must protect speakers of many different points of view, not just the popular or emollient. Either that, or they will in effect protect none.
