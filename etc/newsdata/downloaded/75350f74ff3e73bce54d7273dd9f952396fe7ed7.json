Spencer on Wednesday defended the Navy\u2019s handling of the U.S.S. Gerald Ford aircraft carrier program in the face of criticism from a Democratic lawmaker.\n\nSpeaking at the Brookings Institution, Mr. Spencer rejected comments from Rep. Elaine Luria, a Democrat and former U.S. Navy commander whose district includes Norfolk, who had called the mechanically-troubled supercarrier a multibillion-dollar \u201cberthing barge\u201d at a recent Capitol Hill hearing.\n\n\u201cNone of her comments were, \u2018How can I help?\u2019 I consider that disparaging,\u201d Mr. Spencer said.\n\nNavy officials are taking more of an oversight role regarding the construction of the Ford supercarrier, in particular the vessel\u2019s problem-plagued ammunition elevators, Mr. Spencer said.\n\nHe said Congress is too willing to lay responsibility for problems exclusively at the feet of the Navy brass.\n\n\u201cI have an extra seat there when I testify and I have not seen [Gerald Ford shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls Newport News] up on the Hill,\u201d Mr. Spencer said. \u201cLet\u2019s have open, transparent conversations.\u201d\n\nInconsistent funding and spending limits from Congress, an industry-wide decision several years ago to scale back shipbuilding and increased operational tempo also played a role, he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re sailing the bottoms off the ships and the wings off the planes and we\u2019re paying for it,\u201d Mr. Spencer said.\n\nThe U.S.S. Gerald Ford was supposed to have been operational by now. But with the mechanical problems, that date has been pushed back.\n\nPresident Trump has been critical of some aspects of the contract, but Mr. Spencer said the president understands how complex an issue it is.\n\n\u201cI serve every day at the pleasure of the president. If he\u2019s disappointed in me, he can let me go,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
