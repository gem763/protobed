But rumours have been especially rampant after the release of Red Dead Redemption II, which contains several hidden references to the game.\n\nSome people took this as evidence that an announcement for Bully 2 was imminent but, according to a source at website VGC, while a sequel was in development in the early 2010s enthusiasm at Rockstar \u2018fizzled out\u2019 and it was eventually canned.\n\nDevelopment was apparently centred at Rockstar New England, who worked on Bully: Scholarship Edition, and got as far as a playable demo with \u2018basic open world gameplay\u2019 but work stopped in late 2013.\n\nSupposedly, Rockstar co-founder, and GTA and Red Dead Redemption writer, Dan Houser and his team had finished a script for the game as early as 2008, which included the initial scenes and an outline of the rest of the plot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVGC corroborates earlier claims by YouTuber SWEGTA that the protagonist was Jimmy from the first game and that the story started at Jimmy\u2019s stepdad\u2019s house during the summer.\n\nBut apparently the problem was that nobody could decide what happened after that, or whether Jimmy went back to school or college \u2013 with Rockstar presumably worried the game would just end up as a rerun of the first one.\n\nGiven the time all this was going on the game used the same RAGE (Rockstar Advanced Game Engine) graphic engine as Grand Theft Auto IV and V, Max Payne 3, and Red Dead Redemption. Although no credible screenshots have ever leaked out.\n\nNone of this means that there won\u2019t ever be a Bully 2 but the work that was being done appears to have finished. So if Rockstar do try again they\u2019d almost certainly be doing so from scratch, which will mean an even longer wait till the sequel comes out.\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter", "description": "All those rumours about a sequel to Bully were apparently true, but while there was a playable demo work was stopped years ago.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/caniscanemedit-4e2642342c8bf_1570435250.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
