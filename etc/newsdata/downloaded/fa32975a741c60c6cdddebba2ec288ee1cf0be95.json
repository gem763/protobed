Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.LN) and the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.LN) rose as Michel Barnier, the top EU negotiator, said a deal was possible this week. The pound retook the $1.26 level.\n\nTuesday's session also will feature results from U.S. banks as well as the International Monetary Fund's latest economic forecast. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, in a speech in London, made a case for more rate cuts, that act as insurance, as he said the U.S. central bank will make rate decisions on a meeting-by-meeting basis.\n\nThe ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment for Germany meanwhile fell 0.3 points in October to minus 22.8 points.\n\nWirecard (WDI.XE) shares lost a fifth of their value as the Financial Times reported that internal documents appeared to show the company was trying to inflate profit and revenue at an Irish and Dubai subsidiary. Wirecard didn't comment on the report.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 15, 2019 05:53 ET (09:53 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
