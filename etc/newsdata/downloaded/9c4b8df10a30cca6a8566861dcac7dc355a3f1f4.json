Streets are flooding and levees are about to crest. By Saturday, the storm could dump up to 18 inches of rain on top of an already water-logged state.\n\nWith half-a-foot of rain already unleashed on New Orleans, Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) declared a state of emergency on Wednesday, warning, \u201cNo one should take this storm lightly.\u201d\n\nAs Barry moves inland, it\u2019s expected to impact other areas in Louisiana such as Baton Rouge and Shreveport, as well as cities in Alabama and Mississippi. But with the storm only expected to become a hurricane on Saturday, why is it already so destructive?\n\nIt has a lot to do with climate change, and specifically, with just how wet the past year has been for the United States.\n\nSitting in a bus stop during a downpour as the water rises above the ankles on Canal Street in New Orleans.

Over the past year, the U.S. collectively averaged 36.2 inches of precipitation \u2014 6.25 inches above average.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs an article by NASA\u2019s Earth Observatory explained, \u201cthere is no one explanation for the extreme precipitation of the past year. It does, however, fit with long-term increases in overall precipitation and with heavy rainfall events in our changing climate.\u201d\n\nAnd last year\u2019s National Climate Assessment, released by the Trump administration, warned that climate change will cause more flooding in certain areas, including the Southeast and Midwest regions of the United States.\n\nThe Mississippi River has been swollen for a while now due to the persistent flooding in the Midwest (which began mid-March). And as of last month, the flooding in at least eight states along the Mississippi River \u2014 including Louisiana \u2014 was the longest-lasting since the Great Flood of 1927; Baton Rouge, for instance, had been above flood stage since early January.\n\nCurrently, the lowest water levels of the Mississippi River in New Orleans are just four feet below the tops of the city\u2019s levees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany fear that if Barry strengthens, the levees will easily overflow. Most of New Orleans\u2019 levees are designed to protect the city from 20 feet of water, but according to projections on Wednesday, the Mississippi is expected to crest at 20 feet by Saturday morning due to the storm surge.\n\n#BREAKING: Mississippi River now forecast to crest at 20 Feet in New Orleans due to surge from #BARRY. NOLA levees only protect to 20 Feet! \ud83c\udf00\ud83d\udca6\u2614\ufe0f\ud83c\udf0a#NOLA #LAwx pic.twitter.com/XWllqSPUwP \u2014 Dylan Federico (@DylanFedericoWX) July 10, 2019\n\nWith climate change, oceans become warmer and that increase in heat leads to more moisture in the air \u2014 meaning wetter storms. Like Hurricanes Harvey and Florence, should Barry turn into a hurricane, it is expected to be slow moving and very wet.\n\nOn top of that, climate-driven sea level rise means storm surges are occurring from a higher starting point, which then causes them to bring more water further inland.\n\nAs Alex Kolker, an associate professor at the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium, wrote on Twitter: \u201cIn Louisiana, we can flood three ways. We can flood from water flowing down the Mississippi River, from local rainstorms, or from a storm surge from the Gulf. This week, we\u2019ll have to deal with all three at once.\u201d\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s the perfect storm.\n\nOften, in New Orleans, it\u2019s the same areas that get hit storm after storm. And the areas most at risk now are the same places that were hit hardest by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 \u2014 many of which are still struggling to recover more than a decade later.\n\nFor context, when Katrina hit, the Mississippi was at 3 feet. Right now, it\u2019s at 16 feet.\n\nAll of this comes one day after the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) released a report on 2018 high tide flooding \u2014 also known as sunny day or nuisance flooding \u2014 which found that the rate of flooding is accelerating the fastest along the Northeast Atlantic coastline and the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Flooding in these highly populated coastal areas is exacerbated by hurricanes and other storms combined with sea level rise, NOAA said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis year, the frequency of this high-tide flooding \u2014 which doesn\u2019t require significant rainfall to occur, but can be made worse by it \u2014 is expected to double compared to flooding observed in 2000.\n\nAs NOAA stated in the report: \u201cAnnual flood records are expected to be broken again next year and for years and decades to come.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1154991445.jpg?w=1920&h=1080&crop=1"}
