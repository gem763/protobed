They propose to address this \u201cmarket failure\u201d with a policy that could well lead to economic failure.\n\nFamilies would pay more at the meter and the pump. Approximately 80% of America\u2019s energy needs are met by natural gas, oil, and coal, which means the costs would be economy-wide. It would cost more to manufacture, which would drive up the price of manufactured goods. And it would cost more to farm, which would drive up the costs of food.\n\nAnalysts at The Heritage Foundation used the U.S. Energy Administration Information\u2019s energy model to estimate the effects of a carbon tax to reduce carbon dioxide emissions as aggressively as possible between now and 2040. According to the model\u2019s results, a carbon tax would cause:\n\nA peak employment shortfall of more than 1.4 million jobs.\n\nA total income loss of more than $40,000 for a family of four.\n\nAn aggregate gross domestic product loss of more than $3.9 trillion.\n\nIncreases in household electricity expenditures of 12% to 124%.\n\nEven worse, the burden would be heaviest on low-income families who spend a higher portion of their budget on energy costs. Some carbon tax proposals acknowledge this and offer rebates from the tax revenue collected.\n\nBut even if a rebate check compensates low-income families for their higher energy bills, it won\u2019t undo the damage they\u2019ll incur from paying more for groceries, clothes, health care, and everything else they buy because of the increased cost of energy for all those providers.\n\nSome supporters talk of returning the tax revenue to the people in various ways, but not without taking some kind of cut for their own special interests, whether for green energy projects or new infrastructure.\n\nThen there\u2019s the bureaucratic nightmare of implementing a new tax. Acknowledging that a carbon tax would harm American businesses and U.S. competitiveness, carbon tax proponents suggest enacting a border adjustment tax for imported goods from countries where no carbon pricing exists. Others propose to eliminate environmental regulations in exchange for a carbon tax.\n\nAdministering border taxes on goods imported from countries without carbon taxes \u201cwould be enormously complex, requiring an estimate of the tax-equivalent value of the given policies under examination,\u201d said resident American Enterprise Institute scholar Benjamin Zycher. And the administrative state would be empowered to make decisions micromanaging the economy via tax policy.\n\nSupporters argue a carbon tax is worth it despite the costs, but it\u2019s not clear it would do much to benefit the climate.\n\nNo doubt, carbon dioxide emissions would decline\u2014if you tax something, you\u2019ll get less of it. But the impact on global temperatures would be negligible by the end of the century, even if you assume the most catastrophic scenario.\n\nIt\u2019s also highly unlikely a carbon tax would be faithfully applied to everyone, Zycher pointed out, because various interest groups will influence which businesses are subject to the tax and other countries are likely to implement alternative policies that subsidize solar and wind energy instead of taxing carbon.\n\nCarbon taxes are a cure worse than the alleged disease: They have a minimal impact on emissions and will do next to nothing to affect climate change. In the end, they hurt the very citizens they are intended to help.", "description": "Several members of Congress have floated different carbon tax bills in recent days, some of which have\u00a0both Democratic and Republican sponsorship.\u00a0\n\nBut marginal bipartisan support for enacting a new tax on American families and businesses doesn\u2019t make it good policy.", "authors": ["Nicolas Loris", "Commentary By", "Deputy Director", "Thomas A.
