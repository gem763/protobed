It\u2019s not just \u2018cause you lack attention, it\u2019s \u2018cause you worship D12\u2019s balls, you\u2019re sacrilegious.\u2019\n\nSpeaking to The Guardian, Tyler has now had his say on the diss and, turns out, he\u2019s actually not that fussed \u2013 even if it did spark outrage among his fans.\n\nTyler says he didn\u2019t give Eminem\u2019s diss much thought (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nHe told the publication: \u2018Did you ever hear me publicly say anything about that? Because I knew what the intent was.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018[Eminem] felt pressured because people got offended for me. Don\u2019t get offended for me,\u2019 Tyler said. \u2018We were playing Grand Theft Auto when we heard that. We rewound it and were like, \u201cOh,\u201d and then kept playing.\u2019\n\nEminem has previously apologised for his remarks about Tyler in an interview with Sway in 2018.\n\nThe Lose Yourself hit-maker admitted: \u2018I was angry when I said the sh*t about Tyler.\n\nEminem admits the diss was a bit \u2018too far\u2019 (Picture: Getty Images)\n\n\u2018The word that I called him on that song was one of the things where I felt like, this might be too far\u2026 because in my quest to hurt him, I realised that I was hurting a lot of other people by saying it.\u2019\n\nTyler, meanwhile, was previously banned from the UK by former Prime Minister Teresa May for his own use of homophobic slurs.\n\nIn 2015, May banned Tyler from entering the UK for 3-5 years for encouraging \u2018violence and intolerance of homosexuality\u2019 in his lyrics.\n\nTyler, however, argues that the use of the word \u2018f****t\u2019 in his own lyrics had never been in a homophobic manner.\n\nThe artist, who was recently seen hanging out with Love Island winner Amber Gill, is now allowed back in the UK again.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
