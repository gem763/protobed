With the 2018-19 bushfire season already off to a disastrous start, the lack of water for firefighting is also likely to have dire consequences for the region.\n\nThe photos were taken using surveillance imaging to monitor the \u201cfirst-flush flows\u201d into the Namoi, Macquarie and Warrego catchments and has raised questions about where the water came from.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re following the rules and they\u2019ve got a legally-acquired right, I\u2019ll back them to the hilt,\u201d state member for Barwon, Roy Butler, told the ABC.\n\n\u201cBut at the same time, if people do the wrong thing then I\u2019m happy to see them referred to the regulator, to NRAR, and there be consequences.\n\nRELATED: $8.5 billion spent on Murray-Darling Basin had no effect\n\nRELATED: \u2018Dodgy\u2019 policies to blame for Murray Darling\u2019s downfall\n\nmedia_camera Satellite images of the Namoi, taken March 31 and April 5. Picture: Murray-Darling Basin Authority.\n\nmedia_camera The satellite images have questioned how private dams on the Namoia nd Macquarie rivers filled during a water-pumping embargo earlier this year. Picture: Murray-Darling Basin Authority.\n\n\u201cIn the Namoi, the MDBA found that 29 private storages appeared to fill or partially fill during the embargo. In the Macquarie, another three private storages were found to fill during the embargo,\u201d confirmed MDBA Chief Executive, Phillip Glyde.\n\nThe Murray-Darling Basin Authority has referred the matter to state watchdog, the Natural Resources Access Regulator. However, Mr Glyde insists the images are not absolute proof of illegal activity.\n\n\u201cThere are many reasons why a farm dam could have filled quite legally which is why it is important for follow up work to be done on the ground by state compliance officers.\u201d\n\nMr Glyde added that co-operation between agencies at the state and Commonwealth level is what farmers, local communities and the broader public rightly expect of water managers, especially in times of water scarcity.\n\nmedia_camera Picture: Murray-Darling Basin Authority.\n\nYet the head of the National Irrigators Council, Steve Whan, slammed the public release of the images and told the ABC it should have been handled internally until the matter was resolved.\n\n\u201cMy view is that it would have been fairer if this report had actually just been handed to the regulator and then was made public when they\u2019d actually explored whether there was actually anything that was wrong,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve all got to recognise that, at a time of stress as a result of the most serious drought in the northern basin that\u2019s ever been seen, a lot of people are just going to assume that wrongdoing has occurred.\n\n\u201cAnd that, I think, is unfair and disappointing.\u201d\n\nOriginally published as Blue spots cause Aussie outrage", "description": "Satellite images have raised eyebrows after blue spots appeared in a region of New South Wales, prompting some serious questions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/17ee6fd9519cc2c02317c0f9cf9bba9d", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
