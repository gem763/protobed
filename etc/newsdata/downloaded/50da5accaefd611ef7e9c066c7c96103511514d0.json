A private autopsy also found evidence that Hernandez was physically abused, an allegation at odds with government findings.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe facility\u2019s surveillance video is routinely wiped for storage reasons, according to a statement from the operator of the New Mexico facility, CoreCivic. But the Transgender Law Center, which filed a wrongful death claim on Hernandez\u2019s behalf last fall, argues that ICE and its private partner on the detention center should have kept the footage in a case under investigation and likely to spawn a lawsuit.\n\nThe video\u2019s reported loss has made advocates even more suspicious about the circumstances around Hernandez\u2019s death, said Lynly Egyes, the Transgender Law Center\u2019s legal director.\n\n\u201cIf nothing went wrong, why wouldn\u2019t they hold on to this?\u201d Egyes told The Washington Post. \u201cWhat did happen in those last hours that they chose to destroy?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nICE spokeswoman Britney Walker said the agency \u201cdoes not comment on pending litigation\u201d but that its lack of comment \u201cshould not be construed as agreement with or stipulation to any of the allegations\u201d from the Transgender Law Center.\n\nAD\n\nHernandez headed to the United States with dreams of opening a beauty salon \u2014 and leaving prejudice behind, a family statement says.\n\n\u201cShe fled Honduras because here transgender people are discriminated against,\u201d the family said. \u201cShe left with hopes of living a better life.\u201d\n\nHernandez arrived at Cibola County Correctional Center last May \u201cgravely ill,\u201d according to Amanda Gilchrist, a spokeswoman for CoreCivic. Gilchrist said Hernandez spent 12 hours at Cibola before a medical team decided she needed immediate transport to an outside hospital.\n\nAD\n\nFour days after entering ICE\u2019s custody, 33-year-old Hernandez went to the hospital with symptoms of pneumonia, dehydration and \u201ccomplications associated with untreated HIV,\u201d according to Walker. Just over a week later, she died at another medical center.\n\nAD\n\nStaff initially attributed the death to cardiac arrest, Walker said. An autopsy by the New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator found Hernandez died of a rare disease contracted due to AIDS, following a \u201crapidly progressive illness.\u201d\n\nThe Transgender Law Center contends that Hernandez died from poor medical care.\n\nThe center\u2019s lawyers say her health worsened when she spent time in a cold holding area. Hernandez was also cleared for transport and incarceration the same day a medical screening found her unfit for it, according to a write-up from the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties provided by the Transgender Law Center.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAny person with common sense who encountered Roxsana while she was in custody could see that she was visibly ill,\u201d Egyes said in a statement. \u201cIt does not take a medical degree to understand that a person who was experiencing extreme weight loss, a bad cough and intermittent fevers should not be put in a cage.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nShortly into her detainment, Hernandez told a Customs and Border Protection officer that she had HIV and was not on medication, according to a review commissioned by the government and released by the Transgender Law Center. She described vomiting, suffering from diarrhea and shedding 40 pounds over the course of a month.\n\nICE never gave Hernandez the HIV treatment she needed, the Transgender Law Center says, even though an ICE handbook states that detainees with HIV must get a 30-day supply of prescribed medication. The government-commissioned review of Hernandez\u2019s death says it\u2019s unclear whether she received certain treatments for other ailments recommended by medical staff after her surrender to border authorities.\n\nAD\n\nICE Health Service Corps\u2019s deputy medical director has said patients typically don\u2019t start HIV therapy when they have major health issues. Hernandez wasn\u2019t in custody long enough for the proper evaluations to take place, officials say.\n\nAD\n\nA June 2018 autopsy commissioned by the Transgender Law Center would fuel suspicions about Hernandez\u2019s death. It concluded that she \u201cendured physical assault and abuse while in custody,\u201d citing rib cage bruising and injuries to her back consistent with kicks or blows. Her wrists suggested wounds from handcuffs, the autopsy said.\n\nOfficials have disputed those findings. Authorities in New Mexico said the injuries were probably caused by CPR, and ICE has said no one treating Hernandez raised concerns about abuse.\n\nAD\n\nOther deaths and allegations of substandard care in ICE custody make transparency in Hernandez\u2019s case especially important, the Transgender Law Center\u2019s lawyers say.\n\nAnother transgender woman died this June in the hospital after suffering from illness at a different privately run ICE detention center in New Mexico. An ICE official called it \u201cyet another unfortunate example of an individual who illegally enters the United States with an untreated, unscreened medical condition.\u201d But the death drew scrutiny from groups that earlier this year wrote a concerned letter to the government about the facility, saying some detainees waited weeks for medical care after they requested it.\n\nAD\n\nICE said in a statement that everyone in its custody has \u201cthe unrestricted opportunity to freely request health care services.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAll sick call requests are received and triaged by appropriate medical personnel within 24 hours after a detainee submits the request,\u201d Walker said.\n\nAs the Transgender Law Center gathers evidence for a lawsuit, it has asked the government for any records related to Hernandez\u2019s death. If emails between ICE officials are to be believed, though, surveillance footage from the last place she was held before hospitalization is lost.\n\nAbout three months after Hernandez\u2019s death, an analyst with ICE\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility asked an agency employee in New Mexico for a copy of the footage previously reviewed on-site by ICE officials, the emails indicate.\n\nAD\n\nAbout a week later, the New Mexico employee said the video was \u201cno longer available\u201d because footage is typically deleted after about 90 days.\n\nAD\n\nIn a statement to The Post, CoreCivic spokeswoman Gilchrist gave an even shorter time period, though she later clarified that this could vary by facility. CoreCivic\u2019s cameras are generally not able to retain images beyond 30 days, she said.\n\nGilchrist said CoreCivic did not think to preserve the video because it didn\u2019t know the Transgender Law Center was considering a lawsuit until media reached out last November \u2014 long after the 90-day window.\n\nThe Transgender Law Center\u2019s lawyers say those explanations don\u2019t add up, noting that ICE was reviewing the incident and that it knew within a month of Hernandez\u2019s death that the group was planning an independent autopsy.\n\nICE protocols also call for an internal review after a detainee death \u2014 and sharing with other government officials \u2014 of \u201call facility inspection records\u201d where the person was last held, according to a document TLC says it received from ICE after a different death-in-custody case. TLC points to that emphasis on record-keeping as evidence that deleting the footage flouted the agency\u2019s policies.\n\nAD\n\nOn Wednesday, the center filed a lawsuit against CoreCivic seeking release of the video and other records. CoreCivic says it has complied with most of the Center\u2019s document requests and did not know until this week that the group took issue with what it provided.\n\nBut the Transgender Law Center says it believes the company may be withholding evidence.\n\n\u201cWe want to know what [Hernandez] looked like,\u201d Egyes said. \u201cWe want to know what happened. And that\u2019s why I think its so important for us to see the video.\u201d", "description": "Lawyers call it a disturbing development in their search for justice for Hernandez, a transgender asylum seeker from Honduras who died weeks after surrendering at a port of entry to the United States.", "authors": ["Hannah Knowles", "General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/IcsXbrkvR_vYt9EnP8Y0tYDBhuo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6SCW75S3DII6TGGUQRAIRUJV6I.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
