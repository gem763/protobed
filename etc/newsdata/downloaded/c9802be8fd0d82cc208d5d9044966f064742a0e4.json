Durham has also requested to talk to CIA analysts involved in the intelligence assessment of Russia\u2019s activities, prompting some of them to hire lawyers, according to three former CIA officials familiar with the matter. And there is tension between the CIA and the Justice Department over what classified documents Durham can examine, two people familiar with the matter said. With Barr\u2019s approval, Durham has expanded his staff and the timeframe under scrutiny, according to a law enforcement official directly familiar with the matter. And he is now looking into conduct past Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration in January 2017, a Trump administration official said.\n\nAn unnamed DOJ spokeswoman reportedly said Ukraine is on a list of countries the department is examining for contributing to the Russian probe.\n\nThe spokesperson, however, refused to say whether Durham is investigating \u201ccorruption related to the DNC server\u201d as described by White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney on Thursday.\n\nDuring the July 25 call that triggered the ongoing impeachment probe, Trump urged Ukraine to look into claims the Democratic National Committee (DNC) computer server allegedly hacked by Russian intelligence officers is actually in Ukraine. Under that potential scenario, Ukraine, not Russia, hacked the DNC in 2016.\n\nDuring his October 3 deposition, former U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine Kurt Volker told impeachment investigators it is \u201cplausible\u201d that \u201csome individual Ukrainians may have attempted to influence the 2016 election or thought they could buy influence.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Mulvaney described the Durham review as \u201can ongoing investigation by our Department of Justice into the 2016 election.\u201d\n\nUnder former President Barack Obama, the FBI began its probe into alleged Russian election interference on behalf of the sitting commander-in-chief back in July 2016, before Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. The U.S. government appointed Robert Mueller as special counsel in May 2017.\n\nMueller concluded that the Trump campaign did not coordinate with the Kremlin\u2019s election interference effort, sounding the death knell for the Russian collusion hoax.\n\nBarr has charged Durham with finding out how the Russian investigation began.", "description": "U.S. Attorney General William Barr has significantly expanded a review into the origins of the Russian collusion hoax investigation.", "authors": ["Edwin Mora"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/GettyImages-1157407092-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
