Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) called for total bans on the natural gas extraction process, while former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) made vague promises to review the safety of existing wells.\n\nOn nuclear power, businessman Andrew Yang and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) envisioned a new age of reactors, while others lamented radioactive waste. Dividing lines over whether to end the filibuster, the Senate procedure some fear would obstruct the passage of climate legislation, also became clearer as Harris joined Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in denouncing the practice and Sanders held up an obscure budgetary tool to get around the issue.\n\nThe back-to-back forums, which went until midnight, highlighted the complexity of overhauling the entire global economy and added heft to activists\u2019 calls for a full-on debate on the climate crisis. Though audience questions served as useful proxies for the candidates\u2019 differences, it\u2019s difficult to imagine most voters watching the full slate of town halls and analyzing the distinctions.\n\nYet, just weeks after top Democratic National Committee officials helped tank party activists\u2019 calls for an official, sanctioned debate on the climate crisis, the forum did just what some suspect that party leaders fear \u2015 revealed differences that could result in a televised sparring match and ultimately hurt chances of defeating President Donald Trump.\n\nAt no point did that seem clearer than when Biden, the front-runner in polls, struggled to defend his plans to attend a fundraiser that the co-founder of a major natural gas firm is co-hosting.\n\nFracked Up\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro, the former secretary of housing and urban development, dodged a question about banning fracking but acknowledged that his view of the drilling practice had changed.\n\n\u201cAlmost a decade ago, we had been saying that natural gas was a bridge fuel,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re coming to the end of the bridge.\u201d\n\nSanders, who first called for a ban on fracking during the 2016 presidential campaign, repeated his call earlier in the day but faced no questions on the issue during his CNN segment. Harris said she\u2019d ban fracking on public lands and push for legislation to prohibit the drilling nationwide.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question I\u2019m in favor of banning fracking,\u201d she said.\n\nThe more avowedly centrist candidates trod a middle ground. Both Biden and Klobuchar said they oppose fracking bans but promised to launch exhaustive reviews of the thousands of existing fracking sites to determine which ones were safe. Neither offered details on how such sweeping assessments would be conducted, by when or by whom, or on what legal grounds their administrations would revoke existing permits.\n\nNuke Kids On The Block\n\nNo one seemed more enthusiastic about the future of nuclear power than Yang. He called for converting existing plants from uranium to thorium-based reactors, which produce less radioactive waste, according to the World Nuclear Association.\n\n\u201cTo me, nuclear energy needs to be on the table in a transition to a more renewable economy, because our society consumes a great deal of energy,\u201d Yang said. \u201cAnd nuclear, right now, it gets a bad rap, in part because the technologies we\u2019re using are antiquated.\u201d\n\nBooker touted his \u201cmassive moonshot\u201d proposal on climate that includes \u201cresearch\u201d and \u201cinvestments\u201d in nuclear energy. He called it the \u201cfuture we need to not be fearful of\u201d but rather that \u201cwe need to embrace.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get people excited about what\u2019s there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe as a society, as Americans, must make the investments so we lead humanity to the innovations, the breakthroughs and the jobs of the future.\u201d\n\nBut, with nuclear waste a top concern in the early-voting state of Nevada, others approached the energy source with skepticism. Sanders said it \u201cdoesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense to me to add more dangerous waste to this country and to the world when we don\u2019t know how to get rid of what we have right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe got a heck of a lot of nuclear waste,\u201d Sanders said, \u201cwhich, as you know, is going to stay around this planet for many, many, many thousands of years. And you know what? We don\u2019t know how to get rid of it right now.\u201d\n\nHarris vowed never to force states to take nuclear waste.\n\n\u201cThe biggest issue that I believe we face in terms of nuclear energy is the waste and what are we going to do with that,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Filibluster\n\nWashington Gov. Jay Inslee, who until last month was running as the climate candidate in the race, helped propel calls to scrap the filibuster to the forefront of the national debate. The filibuster is the biggest hurdle to passing a comprehensive climate law, as it forces a 60-vote supermajority to end Senate debate and allows Republicans to obstruct any major legislative progress.\n\nEarly in the night, Harris made news by saying she\u2019d support ending the filibuster if Republicans stood in the way of a Green New Deal, the sweeping industrial plan many Democrats are championing to zero out emissions by midcentury.\n\n\u201cAs president of the United States, I am prepared to get rid of the filibuster to pass a Green New Deal,\u201d she said.\n\nIn making the announcement, she joined Warren, so far the only other major candidate to support ending the filibuster.\n\nBut doing so would require Democrats to win a firm majority in the Senate, a prospect that is far from guaranteed. Sanders instead vowed to pass climate legislation through another congressional procedure, the Budget Reconciliation Act. The procedure, as Vox\u2019s David Roberts described it in a helpful explainer, allows for \u201ca special kind of bill meant to reconcile the federal budget that only requires a majority vote in the Senate to pass.\u201d\n\nSanders noted that former President George W. Bush pushed his tax cuts on the wealthy through that process.\n\n\u201cJust as Bush got through major tax breaks for the rich through the Budget Reconciliation Act, we can do that as well,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if your question is, and we\u2019re going to need 60 votes to save the planet, the answer is, no, we will not. There are ways \u2015 there are ways to get that through the Budget Reconciliation Act, which will require 51 votes, and that\u2019s the method we will use.\u201d\n\nThere were other firm divisions. Despite showing a united front in past debates on health care, Warren made a clear distinction between herself and Sanders on the issue of public ownership of utilities. Sanders\u2019 sweeping $16.3 trillion Green New Deal calls for a massive expansion of federally owned electricity generation, though advisers stressed that it\u2019s a public option, not a complete takeover of the industry.\n\n\u201cIf somebody wants to make a profit from building better solar panels and generating better battery storage, I\u2019m not opposed to that,\u201d Warren said. \u201cWhat I\u2019m opposed to is when they do it in a way that hurts everybody else.\u201d\n\nChris D\u2019Angelo contributed to this report.", "description": "Turns out there would be plenty for the Democrats to debate, should they ever get the chance.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7080c42500007e0404a9e3.jpeg?cache=c1klnemyz7&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
