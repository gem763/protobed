It is VERY concerning that a whistle blower would go to Adam Schiff and report it to him before the DNI and the report was even completed. They went into the committee deposition with the information of the report before it was reported with the DNI. That makes the complaint suspect to outside influence before the National Intelligence agency received it. Why go to Schiff first instead of NIA (if they feared their senior officers wouldn't do anything) if it wasn't politically motivated.", "description": "Felicity Huffman is itching to put the college admissions scandal behind her. Two days after her sentencing, the \"Desperate Housewives\" alum, 56 was photographed back in L.A. on Sunday, visiting a rehab center for addicted and homeless youth, leading to speculation that she has started her 250 hours of community service.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/sEzodDl.iln_D46Fsn27cQ--~B/aD0zOTI7dz03MjA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/33f707f0-d8d2-11e9-bfbf-773349fdf70b"}
