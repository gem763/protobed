Outrageous.'\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Juli\u00e1n Castro traveled to Mexico on Monday and led a group of asylum-seeking migrants to the United States border before immigration officials told them they had to go back despite being exempt from the Trump administration's 'Remain in Mexico' policy\n\nDaniela (right), a lesbian asylum-seeker who abandoned Cuba with her partner Marialy (left), blasted the 'Migrant Protection Protocols' policy and called it a 'trick by Donald Trump'\n\nDemocratic 2020 White House hopeful Juli\u00e1n Castro was critical of the Trump administration's migrant policy after a dozen people were forced to return to the Mexican border town of Matamoros after CBP agreed to review their cases\n\nThe 2020 White House candidate blasted President Donald Trump's 'Migrant Protection Protocols' [MPP], which were implemented in December 2018.\n\nUnder the 'Remain in Mexico' policy, more than 50,000 asylum seekers continue to wait on the Mexican side of the border for their U.S. court cases to be completed.\n\nHowever, the process can take months and has forced some migrants to risk their lives by illegally crossing into the country.\n\nCastro visited a memorial site and laid flowers for the migrants who have died attempting to cross the Rio Grande, including \u00d3scar Alberto Mart\u00ednez Ram\u00edrez, a Salvadoran who gave up hope on the asylum process and drowned while trying to save his 23-month-old daughter, Valeria, after crossing the river in June.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Juli\u00e1n Castro attacked Donald Trump's immigration policies after a group of migrants from Latin America were forced to return to Mexico\n\nAsylum seekers (pictured) await at the U.S. border to attend their hearings before they were told to go back to Matamoros, a Mexican border city, where thousands of migrants continue to wait out for a meeting with American immigration officials\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate and former Housing and Urban Development secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro talks to a Salvadoran woman awaiting in Mexico to have her asylum request processed by immigration officials on the U.S. side of the border\n\n'Donald Trump doesn't want immigrants in this country because he believes that it only belongs to people who look like him.

Rich and poor,' the former Housing and Urban Development secretary and San Antonio mayor added.\n\nThose spared from program 'includes [migrants] who claim a fear of return to Mexico at any point during apprehension, processing, or such proceedings, but who have been assessed not to be more likely than not to face persecution or torture in Mexico. Unaccompanied [migrant] children and [migrants] in expedited removal proceedings will not be subject to MPP. Other individuals from vulnerable populations may be excluded on a case-by-case basis.'\n\nDaniela, a 22-year-old lesbian who fled Cuba with her partner, told the Los Angeles Times she walked across the bridge with Castro to demonstrate that the 'Migrant Protection Protocols' was just a 'trick by Donald Trump.'\n\nAnother democratic presidential hopeful, Beto O'Rourke, also witnessed firsthand how CBP leaned on Trump's controversial policy to send back to Mexico a group of migrants that he had accompanied from Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez in June.\n\nPresidential candidate Juli\u00e1n Castro visits refugees on the Mexican side of the border who are attempting to seek asylum in the United States", "description": "Democratic presidential hopeful Juli\u00e1n Castro led 12 asylum-seeking migrants to the U.S. border before they were sent back to Mexico on Monday.", "authors": ["Adry Torres For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/16/19449100-0-image-a-22_1570550237517.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
