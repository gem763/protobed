I read it. 'I can't believe, it's extraordinary. We're going to speak about it on Loose Women'.\n\n\"The whole time thinking it was Coleen Nolan. i did honestly. I realise there are clearly two Coleens.\n\n\"It was a slightly different take for me for three hours. then it took a different take as it went on.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nLoose Women panellist Jane Moore admitted her husband, Gary Farrow, had made the same mistake.\n\nJane confessed she was glad that a great showbiz story had taken the attention away from Brexit chat.\n\nAdmitting Becky's defence could be correct, she said: \"It's fascinating. I assume they were quite good friends as Coleen has a personal and public Instagram account.\n\n\"On Rebekah Vardy's side, I know a lot of high profile people in showbiz have accounts they run for them over the years. They feed the beast. I have access to my younger daughter\u2019s Instagram, until she\u2019s 16. I can switch between accounts.\n\n\"So it is possible somebody else is able to view it if people know Rebekah Vardy\u2019s password.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nChristine is not the only WAG to have her say on the scandal, which has gripped the nation over the last two days.\n\nSpeaking on This Morning, Danielle Lloyd admitted she was not surprised as she'd had \"run-ins\" with Becky in the past.\n\nDanielle said: \"I wasn\u2019t that shocked. I\u2019ve had run-ins with Rebekah before over similar things. Obviously like everyone else you read it and are like 'oh my gosh', but I wasn\u2019t as shocked seeing who it allegedly was.\n\n\"It's definitely come out of Becky's account. I think she did it. Sadly I really do. It's a shame as she probably didn't think she was going to get caught out.\n\n\"I think that if she was feeding the press, maybe she would get more headlines for herself. I could never do that to somebody.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nIn the same interview, fellow former WAG Lizzie Cundy expressed her wish to mediate between the warring pair.\n\nLizzie said: \"I just hope we can sort this out. I think we should sit round a table and get to the bottom of it rather than get all legal and public.\n\n\"Coleen is a very honest and lovely girl. She would never have gone and outed someone publicly like this if she didn\u2019t have 100% proof.\"\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX/Shutterstock)\n\n(Image: Twitter)\n\nAfter Coleen put the explosive post on Twitter and Instagram - it took just minutes for Becky to respond and deny the claims.\n\nRebekah replied: \"As I have just said to you on the phone, I wish you had called me if you thought this.\n\n\"I never speak to anyone about you as various journalists who have asked me to over the years can vouch for.\n\n\"If you thought this was happening you could have told me & I could have changed my passwords to see if it stopped.\n\n\"Over the years various people have had access to my insta & just this week I found I was following people I didn't know and have never followed myself\n\n\"I'm not being funny but I don't need the money, what would I gain from selling stories on you?\n\nI liked you a lot Coleen & I'm so upset that you have chosen to do this, especially when I'm heavily pregnant.\n\n\"I'm disgusted that I'm even having to deny this. You should have called me the first time this happened.\"\n\n*Loose Women airs weekdays on ITV at 12.30pm", "description": "There was a major mistaken identity as Christine believed Coleen Nolan was involved for three hours", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Itv", "Dave J Hogan Getty Images", "Getty Images", "Ken Mckay Itv Rex Shutterstock", "Twitter"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20552292.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_d-thought-Coleen-Nolan-had-started-war-with-Becky-Vardy_5773JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
