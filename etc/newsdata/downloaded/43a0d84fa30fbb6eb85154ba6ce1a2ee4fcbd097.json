It\u2019s all a bit raw for me but I wanted to raise awareness for domestic abuse,\" she wrote.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n\"I just want to post traits and warning signs so you can recognise them before it's too late. I will open up fully and share my story once I come to terms with it all and I hope you understand.\"\n\nShe went on: \"Domestic violence affects millions, both women and men, of every race, religion, culture and status. It's not just punches and black eyes; it's yelling, humiliation, stalking, manipulation, coercion, threats and isolation.\n\n\"It's stealing a paycheck, keeping tabs online, non-stop texting, constant use of the silent treatment, or calling someone stupid so often they believe it.\"\n\n(Image: Malin Andersson/Instagram)\n\nMalin then shared traits of narcissism, including a lack of empathy, entitlement, arrogance and grandiosity.\n\nShe also listed the feelings of innocent partners trapped inside narcassistic relationships, which include \"feeling not good enough, self-doubt and second guessing [and being] chronically apologetic - confusion and as though you are losing your mind\".\n\nThe reality star also shared the helpline for Women's Aid, which can help victims of domestic abuse - including physical, emotional, financial and sexual violence.\n\n\"I also recommend the FREEDOM COURSE which has helped me massively. 'ONCE YOU CHOOSE HOPE, ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE',\" she added.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nMalin did not name her alleged abuser or detail when the picture was taken.\n\nShe also did not confirm whether she has reported the matter to the police.\n\nJust yesterday, the Love Islander had hinted at dark feelings in a post about her trip to Bali.\n\nThe bereaved mum wrote: \"It's been such a difficult month for me. For various reasons which will be spoken about soon. But hey ho it\u2019s my birthday in 2 days and I get to spend it in sunshine.\n\n\"Raising awareness for so many different things is what I'm about but it's also tough for me sometimes as it brings stuff back up to the surface. I'm still alive, I still have food on my table and amazing friends. Truly blessed,\" she added.", "description": "Malin Andersson, who came to fame on Love Island, claimed she was a victim of domestic abuse in a stark warning about violent relationships", "authors": ["Emmeline Saunders", "Image", "Instagram Pa", "Instagram", "Malin Andersson Instagram"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article19019063.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Malin-Andersson-poses-nude.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
