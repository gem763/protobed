Like many young people, I was terrified about Brexit \u2013 what it would mean for me, my family and my future. Most of us felt like there was nothing we could do about it, that the government and so many other people were willing to ram Brexit through, despite it being nothing like what was promised. No matter the consequences.\n\nSo I was intrigued by the People\u2019s Vote campaign, if not overly hopeful about its success.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nHow things have grown in the months since that launch.\n\nThere are lots of reasons for this; the energy and dynamism of youth groups like For our Future\u2019s Sake (FFS) and Our Future Our Choice (OFOC); the sheer mess that the government has made of the Brexit process. But perhaps most importantly, because we are the only campaign and the only democratic solution to an escalating Brexit crisis which has humiliated our country. It cannot be sorted by anyone apart from the people \u2013 and the time for a people\u2019s vote has come.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It will be hard. But anything worth having should be, and People\u2019s Vote campaigners \u2013 old and young \u2013 are in this to win this.\n\nWe start in my adoptive home of Leeds on Saturday 22 June, where I lived for three years as a student. The campaign will make its way around the country \u2013 from Glasgow to Newport, Sunderland to Derby. At the heart of our programme will be the recognition that it is vital that our voices are heard in the towns, cities and villages of the United Kingdom. In particular, areas that voted Leave in 2016.\n\nWe will then go straight for the people we need to convince the most \u2013 members of parliament. We will hold events in Brighton and Manchester for the Labour and Conservative Party annual conferences. After that, we will be hitting the streets of London on 12 October for the biggest Brexit march yet.\n\nThe People\u2019s Vote campaign is a truly unique movement made up of people from all walks of life, and across the United Kingdom. We\u2019re all different people with very different politics, but we have coalesced around the idea that it is the people who should decide Brexit, not just politicians.\n\nNo one else \u2013 whether they\u2019re running for prime minister, setting up a new party or trying to hold together an old one \u2013 can bring together people from all parties and backgrounds. FFS, OFOC, Open Britain and the European Movement are joined by a wealth of organisations from across the country and representing marginalised groups.\n\nWe all agree on one thing: it would be a democratic and moral outrage for a new prime minister \u2013 elected by 0.25 per cent of the electorate \u2013 to impose a destructive no-deal Brexit on the British people.\n\nIt would hit places like Newcastle, where I\u2019m from, the hardest, for the longest. Nobody voted to destroy our vital manufacturing sector, or to make working-class people poorer.\n\nThis summer, we will make the biggest and loudest case for a people\u2019s vote we possibly can.\n\nBy 12 October, we will be heard.\n\nEllie James is a supporter of the youth-led campaign group For Our Future\u2019s Sake (FFS), part of the People\u2019s Vote campaign", "description": "I remember spotting The Independent\u2019s Final Say\u00a0and\u00a0People\u2019s Vote\u00a0campaign launch on TV from my home in Newcastle\u00a0last year.
