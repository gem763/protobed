REUTERS/Marco Bello\n\nBahamian Prime Minister Hubert Minnis told the nation in a televised address that the death toll from Dorian remained at 50, but conceded that the large number of people missing meant that number would rise.\n\n\u201cThe number of deaths is expected to significantly increase,\u201d Minnis said, adding the government was being transparent and would provide \u201ctimely information on the loss of life as it is available.\u201d\n\nEmergency management officials told a separate news conference that the list of missing had not yet been checked against records of evacuees or the thousands of people staying in shelters.\n\n\u201cMy friends are missing, a few of my cousins are missing over there, five in total, they lived in Marsh Harbour,\u201d said Clara Bain, a 38-year-old tour guide, referring to the Abaco town where officials estimate that 90% of homes and buildings were damaged or destroyed.\n\n\u201cEveryone on the islands are missing someone, it\u2019s really devastating,\u201d she said.\n\nDorian slammed into the Bahamas on Sept. 1 as a Category 5 storm on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale of intensity, one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record to make a direct hit on land and packing top sustained winds of 185 miles per hour (298 kph).\n\n\u201cOur sympathies go out to the families of each person who died,\u201d Minnis said. \u201cLet us pray for them during this time of grief. We offer you our shoulders to cry on. You will never be forgotten.\u201d\n\nMore than 5,000 people evacuated to New Providence, the island where the capital, Nassau, is located, in the face of the worst hurricane in the country\u2019s history. But there has since been a significant reduction in the number now asking to be relocated, according to emergency management officials.\n\nSome 15,000 people are still in need of shelter or food, according to the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency.\n\nOfficials have already put up large tents in Nassau to house those made homeless by the storm and plan to erect tent cities on Abaco capable of sheltering up to 4,000 people.\n\nMinnis thanked U.S. President Donald Trump and the American people for mobilizing support and urged Bahamians to pitch in with relief efforts by volunteering or donating money to legitimate charities.\n\nThe White House said on Wednesday the United States would not give temporary protected immigration status to people fleeing the Bahamas after the hurricane.\n\nThe status would have allowed Bahamians to live and work in the United States while their country recovers.\n\nPrivate forecasters estimated that Dorian destroyed or damaged some $3 billion in insured property in the Bahamas or elsewhere in the Caribbean.\n\nCommercial flights to Abaco, one of the hardest-hit areas, resumed on a limited basis on Wednesday.", "description": "Some 2,500 people are still listed as missing in the Bahamas more than a week after Hurricane Dorian pummeled the Caribbean island chain, although that number may include evacuees who fled to shelters, authorities said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Zachary Fagenson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428851167&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A1MW", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
