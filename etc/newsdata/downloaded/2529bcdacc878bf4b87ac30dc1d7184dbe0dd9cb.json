For those same schedules, Trump has had about 77 hours scheduled for meetings that include policy planning, legislative strategy and video recordings.\n\nSome days, Executive Time totally predominates. For instance, he had 1 hour of scheduled meetings on Jan. 18 (with acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin) and 7 hours of Executive Time.\n\nThe day after the midterms, Trump's schedule had 30 minutes for a chief of staff meeting and more than 7 hours for Executive Time.\n\nthe midterms, Trump's schedule had 30 minutes for a chief of staff meeting and more than 7 hours for Executive Time.

It's also because a more detailed schedule \u2014 kept within a very small, tight circle \u2014 typically has 1 or 2 extra meetings per day that aren't listed on private schedules sent to staff.\n\nThe president sometimes has meetings during Executive Time that he doesn't want most West Wing staff to know about for fear of leaks.
