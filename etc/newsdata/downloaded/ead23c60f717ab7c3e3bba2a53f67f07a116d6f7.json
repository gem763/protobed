In it she wrote, \u201cYou are not alone,\u201d alongside a fresh-faced selfie.\n\n\u201cYou are where you\u2019re meant to be. You are surviving. You are alive. You are,\u201d Hyland wrote. However, some were quick to jump into Hyland\u2019s comments to claim that the message was coming from a place of privilege.\n\n\u201cYou are rich, you are popular, you have a fianc\u00e9, you are healthy, you are pretty, you are in good shape, you are happy,\u201d one critic noted. While another added, \u201cSome people are alone. What you should not do is make mental health seem like a simple issue.\u201d\n\nBut when one other follower commented, \u201cPeople saying you are not alone is so frustrating to me. I am alone in this sense because no one gives a damn!\u201d Hyland herself responded, \u201cThere is always someone who gives a damn. You just might not have met them yet.\u201d\n\nMany others replied to Hyland\u2019s post with messages of gratitude for both her authenticity and the way that she uses her platform to bring light to issues, including her struggles with kidney dysplasia.\n\n\u201cThanks for this,\u201d one fan wrote. \u201cI appreciate the hell out of celebrities making mental health more serious of a topic.\u201d\n\n\u201cGirl you will forever be my hero for helping shed a light on chronic illness and mental health,\u201d commented another.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "Sarah Hyland is using her social media to provide fans with a necessary reminder on World Mental Health Day.", "authors": ["Kerry Justich"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XV70BX7m8ybVYKkGY5B4Pg--~B/aD0xMzQ5O3c9MTA4MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/31289a30-eba0-11e9-be2b-78ce3e8fd345", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
