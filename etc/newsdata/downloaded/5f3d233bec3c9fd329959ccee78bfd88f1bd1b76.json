The SDF lost 11,000 fighters in the US-led campaign.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Trump had authorized \u2014 but not yet activated \u2014 \u201cvery significant new sanctions\u201d to dissuade Turkey from further offensive military action.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper weighed in forcefully, saying Turkey risked destabilizing the region and accusing President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of taking \u201cimpulsive action.\u201d\n\nEsper \u201cstrongly encouraged\u201d Turkey to halt the offensive, warning of \u201cserious consequences,\u201d adding that he and Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark Milley had spoken directly to their Turkish counterparts.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans in Congress have united to back sanctions on Turkey if it launches a full assault on the SDF.\n\nThe series of US statements contrasted sharply with wayward signals sent by Washington since Trump said last Sunday that he expected Turkish troops to begin attacking.\n\nErdogan wants to create a buffer zone between the border and territory controlled by Syrian Kurdish forces, who have links with Turkey\u2019s own Kurdish rebels.\n\n\u2013 US seeks to curb Turkey \u2013\n\nThe US president initially voiced understanding of Turkey\u2019s wish to launch the offensive before later warning that the operation should be \u201chumane\u201d and offering to mediate.\n\nHe had come under heavy criticism, even among usually steadfast Republicans, over what many saw as the blatant betrayal of a faithful US ally.\n\nBut the choreographed US diplomatic effort to compel Turkey to minimize its offensive may have little impact on the ground.\n\nErdogan on Friday swiftly dismissed Esper\u2019s call for Turkey to stop the offensive.\n\n\u201cNow there are threats coming from left and right, telling us to stop this,\u201d Erdogan said. \u201cWe will not step back.\u201d\n\nTurkish forces pressed ahead on Friday, battling to seize towns on the third day of the operation that has forced 100,000 civilians to flee.\n\n\u201cI have yet no indication that they are willing to stop,\u201d Esper admitted.\n\nTurkey has launched mostly air and artillery attacks on the SDF and had only used \u201climited\u201d ground forces, according to US military chiefs.\n\nThe Turkish action has not yet breached any \u201cred lines\u201d set by Trump, though details of the criteria remain unclear.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want them killing a lot of people\u2026 if we have to use sanctions we will,\u201d Trump said on Friday, giving no further details.\n\nHe said he would look into reports of Turkish forces shelling US special forces in northern Syria.\n\n\u2013 Rising death toll \u2013\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Friday that the civilian death toll was 17 on the Syrian side, while 17 have also been killed in Turkey.\n\nAccording to the Observatory, 54 fighters from the SDF have also been killed while Turkey has reported the deaths of four soldiers.\n\n\u201cEvery concern I had about President Trump\u2019s Syria decision is coming true in spades,\u201d said Lindsey Graham, a loyal Republican senator and a leading voice on US foreign policy.\n\nThe offensive, the third such Turkish operation since the start of the war in Syria, has been met with fierce international condemnation.\n\nBut Trump has portrayed his decision to pull back troops as part of his election pledge to end US involvement in \u201cridiculous endless wars.\u201d", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 Facing a backlash for appearing to greenlight Turkey\u2019s assault against Kurdish forces in Syria, President Donald Trump on", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/11/5de7bb_members-special-forces-kurdish-led-syrian-democratic-forces-sdf-preparations-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
