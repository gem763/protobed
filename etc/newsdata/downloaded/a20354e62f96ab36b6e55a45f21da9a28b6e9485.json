Ireland's Iain Henderson in action REUTERS/Peter Cziborra\n\nDespite never making it past the quarter-finals at six previous tournaments, hopes were high the Irish could reach the last four, having been regarded the best side in the world less than a year ago.\n\nInstead, their performances showed they had peaked about a year too early.\n\nTheir best results came from late-2016 until last November, a period which included their first win against the All Blacks \u2014 a 40-29 triumph in Chicago.\n\nThat launched a run of 23 victories in 27 tests, and after their 16-9 win over New Zealand in Dublin last November, All Blacks coach Steve Hansen proclaimed them the World Cup favourites.\n\nIreland struggled to reach those heights again and shortcomings in their suffocating style of play were exposed before the World Cup in a 57-15 thrashing by England.\n\nCoach Joe Schmidt complained then of a \u201cmalaise\u201d surrounding the side.\n\nDespite a subsequent defeat of Wales and a dominant win in their World Cup opener against a Scotland team that did not show up, it was apparent they were underperforming.\n\nThey were shocked 19-12 by Japan at Shizuoka Stadium and while they beat Russia 35-0 and Samoa 47-5, only the most hopeful fan expected them to stay beyond the All Blacks clash.\n\n\u201cWhen you hit a high there is always a little bit of a drop,\u201d Schmidt said after the 46-14 loss to the All Blacks on Saturday.\n\nSchmidt, whose Ireland tenure has now ended, said the defeat had \u2018broken\u2019 him, while the country\u2019s obsession with breaking their quarter-final curse appeared to have distracted the players.\n\nThe New Zealander exits with inspirational captain Rory Best, who has retired.\n\nJohnny Sexton, who is 34, 30-year-old Conor Murray and outside backs Rob Kearney (33) and Keith Earls (32) may not have another World Cup cycle left in their legs.\n\nVeteran prop Cian Healy (32) and loose forward Peter O\u2019Mahony (30) may also not be around for France in 2023.\n\nNew coach Andy Farrell, however, has the ability to build around lock James Ryan and a backline of Jacob Stockdale, Garry Ringrose and Robbie Henshaw.\n\nEarls said the future might be promising.\n\n\u201cWe were so close and ... we just seem to shoot ourselves in the foot in quarter-finals,\u201d the 32-year-old said.\u201dHopefully under Faz (Farrell) the lads can build and get that one step further.\u201d", "description": "Ireland's boisterous fans drowned out the All Blacks' pre-match haka with a stirring rendition of Fields of Athenry on Saturday but leave Japan having to wait at least another four years for World Cup success.", "authors": ["Greg Stutchbury", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191020&t=2&i=1442865106&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9J025", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
