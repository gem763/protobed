Australia\u2019s Mitchell Marsh claimed his first five-wicket haul in test cricket to end the innings.\n\nSmith, who has scored more than twice as many runs as any other batsman in the series, underpinned the visitors\u2019 reply with more than four hours at the crease before being trapped lbw by Woakes to record his lowest score of the series.\n\nHe built his innings cautiously, scoring nine fours and just one six, which came when he lofted a Jack Leach ball far over long on to bring up his half-century.\n\nIt was Smith\u2019s 10th consecutive 50 against England in tests, the most in a row by any batsmen against any other nation in the longest format of the game.\n\nSmith has now scored 751 runs in six innings, more than twice as many as any other batsman on either side in the series.\n\nARCHER BREAKTHROUGH\n\nEngland had struggled to break the combination of Smith and Marnus Labuschagne for almost an hour after lunch before Archer made the breakthrough, catching Labuschagne out lbw on 48 with an inswinging ball.\n\nCurran then claimed the wicket of Matthew Wade, out lbw for 19 runs, bringing Marsh to the crease.\n\nMarsh was out soon after tea, hooking an Archer bouncer all the way down to deep fine leg, where Leach crouched down in front of the boundary rope to take a low catch.\n\nCurran stole Archer\u2019s limelight when he bagged the wickets of Australia captain Tim Paine (1) and Pat Cummins (0) with consecutive balls to leave the visitors on 166 for 7.\n\nArcher then seized it back, claiming the wickets of Nathan Lyon (25) and Peter Siddle (18) - caught brilliantly by a diving Burns in the slips - to give England a first-innings lead of 69 runs.\n\nAustralia\u2019s openers David Warner and Marcus Harris both fell early in the day to the fast bowling of Archer for single-digit scores.\n\nSlideshow (15 Images)\n\nWarner\u2019s miserable series with the bat continued when, after picking up five runs, he got the slightest of touches on an Archer delivery as it flew through to wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow.\n\nWarner is the first opening batsmen in test cricket to get out for eight single-digit scores in a series, with only one innings left to play to get his Ashes average into double figures.\n\nArcher claimed his second wicket soon after when Harris on three edged a ball to Ben Stokes at second slip.", "description": "Jofra Archer took six wickets as England's bowlers gave their side a handy lead on the second day of the final Ashes test, reducing Australia to 225 all out in reply to their own first innings score of 294 at the Oval on Friday.", "authors": ["Hugh Lawson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429517228&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C1Y7", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
