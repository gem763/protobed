Google\u2019s website for the new devices only notes that they\u2019re eligible for the same storage option as any other phone, which is unlimited backups at \u201chigh quality.\u201d This option compresses your images when they\u2019re uploaded to the cloud, which is why Google is able to offer it so freely.\n\nNowhere on the Pixel 4 site does it mention free storage at original quality, which was a major incentive for purchasing the original Pixel, Pixel 2, and Pixel 3. iPhone owners had to keep an eye on their iCloud storage, but Pixel users could always snap away care free. Not anymore. Google didn\u2019t extend it to the Pixel 3A and 3A XL, but that was understandable due to their much lower price point. The Pixel 4 starts at $799, and the XL version is $899. These aren\u2019t cheap phones.\n\nOne of the best perks of buying a Pixel is gone\n\nPixel 3 owners get free storage for their original-quality photos and videos until January 31st, 2022. So they\u2019re in the clear for a long time before having to worry about paying anything. But the Pixel 4 won\u2019t get you special treatment anymore. Google has confirmed directly to The Verge that the deal isn\u2019t on offer this time around.\n\nWhy the change? The Pixel 4\u2019s main camera is still 12 megapixels, so it\u2019s not churning out larger files. The portrait lens is 16MP \u2014 a bit larger yes, but not really enough to stress Google\u2019s cloud when you factor in how many Pixels the company usually sells.\n\nThe real reason is subscriptions. Google is including a three-month free trial of its Google One subscription service with Pixel 4 purchases, and that membership comes with 100GB of storage (and is eligible for family sharing). So Google might be hoping to shift Pixel owners who need bountiful backup space over to a recurring subscription.", "description": "The Pixel 4 and 4 XL will launch without one of the original great reasons for owning a Pixel phone: free unlimited photo backups to Google Photos at original, full-resolution quality.", "authors": ["Chris Welch", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tnJmnePc64kFW8CaPytLaXkkIW8=/0x126:1115x710/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19289316/Screen_Shot_2019_10_15_at_11.26.20_AM.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
