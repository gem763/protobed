An at-home sommelier? Well, we put our pallets to the test with a wine taste test.\n\nYou might be the type of wine drinker who goes on vineyard tours. Or, hey, you might be the type who prefers to drink boxed wine while binge-watching \"Scandal\" on your sofa. Either way, we can probably all agree on at least two things: wine is good, and any empirical test that involves drinking it in the name of research is worth doing.\n\nCLOSE Can you really taste the difference between expensive and cheap wines? Grateful\n\nLet\u2019s brush up on a few tenets of wine tasting. Keep this in mind as you go from glass to glass \u2014 you might just prove to be more of a DIY sommelier than you even suspected.\n\nMore: Wine ingredient lists & labels explained\n\nStep one, look at the wine before you. Is it opaque? How\u2019s the viscosity? Is the color vibrant? Sometimes you can tell the quality of a wine just by inspecting it visually.\n\nStep two, smell it. Yep, be one of those people. Regardless of how expensive (or not) a wine is, the odor might clue you in to whether you\u2019re going to love it or want to leave it.\n\nFinally, step three, taste it! This is obviously the best part of building your wine palate.\n\nFor this experiment, we tested \u201cupscale\u201d and inexpensive versions of sauvignon blanc, chardonnay, pinot noir and cabernet. But feel free to add in any other varieties your wine-loving heart wants. You can always cut down the cost by getting a group of friends together for this blind test. Just remember to drink responsibly.\n\nWhen all is said and done, you\u2019ll likely walk away a little (or a lotta) wine drunk \u2014 but, more to the point of this experiment, you\u2019ll realize that you can\u2019t always judge a bottle of wine by its price tag.\n\nWe also taste-tested healthier candy options to determine which ones are actually good.
