It has gone to high-yield bond investors before, but that was back in 2018, when junk bonds were the hot unicorn trend.\n\nAs of yesterday morning in New York, the price of WeWork debt tumbled, as jittery investors sold the bonds. To give an indication of investor reaction to WeWork's news cycle, on Friday the company's bonds were trading above par at 102.78 at a yield of 7.26% but as of Wednesday it was trading at 97.71 with a yield well above 8% at 8.4%.\n\nWeWork is now in a funding bind, having lined up a $6 billion credit line that is contingent on it raising at least $3 billion in its IPO, according to its S1 offering prospectus.\n\nRead more: WeWork's valuation is under fire. Here's everything we know about its IPO plans, finances and concerns around CEO Adam Neumann.\n\n\"The whole company is built on continuously sourcing money from different investors based on higher and higher valuations. If the company's value is in question, the whole thing unravels,\" John McClain, a portfolio manager at Diamond Hill, a US investment firm that manages fixed-income funds, told Business Insider in an interview.\n\n\"Their borrowing model is seriously in question at this point,\" he added.\n\nHolders of WeWork's existing debt have already started selling off their holdings as a result of the IPO's struggle to gain traction. The company had initially hoped for a massive valuation of around $47 billion, but The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that the company reportedly could slash the valuation to below $20 billion.\n\nMcClain said in the case of WeWork, he had never seen a unicorn with such a high valuation seemingly have so little support from both equity and debt investors.\n\nWeWork declined to comment to Business Insider.\n\nWeWork's hunger for junk bond debt in 2018\n\nWeWork previously issued $702 million in unsecured bonds in 2018, at a hot point in fixed income markets. The company is rated B, sub-investment grade or junk, by ratings agencies Fitch and S&P, meaning its debt issuance appeals to high-yield investors who are willing to take on more risk to fund a company.\n\nThe company's inaugural junk bonds yielded 7.875% and attracted plenty of investor interest, following in the path of other fast growing tech companies like Uber, Tesla, and Netflix in tapping the high yield market. However, investors have become increasingly wary of cash burning companies piling on leverage amid dubious financials.\n\nHighly rated private tech companies with valuations north of $1 billion, known as unicorns, are not traditional occupants of the high yield space. But they found a sweet spot of investor demand starting last year amid low US Treasury yields and a boom in leveraged lending.\n\nThe attractiveness of these companies was previously described as a \"halo effect,\" but a lack of cogent information about a company's explicit financials can cause investor sentiment to tumble.", "description": "\"The whole company is built on continuously sourcing money from different investors based on higher and higher valuations.\"", "authors": ["Callum Burroughs"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d78c0012e22af279c6d212d-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
