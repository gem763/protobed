As one woman went up to sign, she referred to herself as a \u201csynod mother,\u201d a parallel to bishops participating in the Oct. 6-27 Synod of Bishops on the Amazon who are called \u201csynod fathers.\u201d\n\nAlso expected to sign were a Lutheran pastor and a pastor of the Assemblies of God who attended a Mass celebrated by Brazilian Cardinal Claudio Hummes, the relator, or chairman, of the Synod of Bishops on the Amazon.\n\nThe new pact contains 14 points, the first of which is a call to defend the Amazon rainforest in the face of global warming and depletion of natural resources. The first three, in fact, concern care for God\u2019s creation and a reminder that man is not the owner of \u201cMother Earth, but rather the sons and daughters,\u201d called to be caregivers.\n\nThe original 42 bishops who signed the 1965 pact pledged to \u201ctry to live according to the ordinary manner of our people in all that concerns housing, food, [and] means of transport\u2026. We renounce forever the appearance and the substance of wealth, especially in clothing \u2026 and symbols made of precious metals.\u201d\n\nIn the Amazon version, it\u2019s not until the fourth point that signatories affirm their \u201cpreferential option for the poor,\u201d underlining native peoples in particular, making them protagonists in society and in the Church, helping them \u201cpreserve their lands, cultures, languages, stories, identities and spiritualities.\u201d\n\nThe following point calls on the Church to abandon \u201call types of colonist mentality and posture,\u201d welcoming the cultural, ethnic and linguistic diversity in dialogue \u201cwith all spiritual traditions.\u201d\n\nThe bishops also pledged to denounce violence towards native peoples, to walk ecumenically with other Christians and to establish \u201ca synodal lifestyle where representatives of original peoples, missionaries, lay people, because of their baptism and in communion with their pastors, have voice and vote in diocesan assemblies, in pastoral and parish councils and, ultimately, everything that concerns the governance of the communities.\u201d\n\nProclamation of the \u201cliberating novelty of the Gospel of Jesus in welcoming the other and the one who is different\u201d comes in point seven.\n\nSignatories also pledged to recognize ecclesial ministries in the communities, and to go from \u201cpastoral visits to pastoral presence\u201d to ensure that the right to the \u201cTable of the World and the Table of the Eucharist are effective in all communities.\u201d\n\nThe pact also calls for finding new paths of pastoral action, with particular attention to the peripheries, such as migrants, workers and the unemployed.\n\nFacing what signatories call an \u201cavalanche of consumerism,\u201d they pledge to assume a \u201chappily sober lifestyle, simple and in solidarity with those who have little or nothing; to reduce the production of garbage and the use of plastics, favoring the production and commercialization of agro-ecological products; and using public transport whenever possible.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Amazon synod reports support, dissent on married priests and women deacons\n\nFor the occasion, Hummes wore the stole of late Brazilian Archbishop Helder Camera of Olidna and Recife, the driving force behind the 1965 declaration.\n\nWhen Mass ended, Hummes gave the stole to retired Austrian Bishop Erwin Kr\u00e4utler of Xingu, Brazil, which is located in the Amazon, saying he deserves to carry the \u201crelic.\u201d The Austrian is believed to have been the architect of this new Catacombs Pact.\n\nItalian Bishop Luigi Bettazzi, now 95 and the only original signatory from 1965 still living, wasn\u2019t in the Catacombs of Domitila, some five miles from St. Peter\u2019s Square, due to health and advanced age. He was, however, informed, and according to organizers, sent his regards.\n\nPeruvian Cardinal Pedro Ricardo Barreto told Crux that Pope Francis \u201cknows everything, he\u2019s being properly informed.\u201d Speaking with journalists after the Mass, Hummes said that the pope hadn\u2019t \u201cformally\u201d been told about the renewal of the pact, but that he would be brought up to speed.\n\nIn his homily, the Brazilian delivered a strong critique of accumulation of wealth, defining money as the driving force of \u201ceverything that is evil today,\u201d including war and violence.\n\n\u201cWe ask of the synod new paths, better conditions to be able to proclaim the word,\u201d Hummes said, saying that one has to be insistent, even with those opposed to the Kingdom of God.\n\nHe said that the Catacombs is a \u201cHoly Land,\u201d where the blood of the first Christian communities was shed, and which served as a refuge to those persecuted for their faith in God.\n\n\u201cMay God give us the strength he gave Christians of that time,\u201d Hummes said.\n\nSpeaking about the Church as semper reformanda, meaning, in a constant state of reform, Hummes said changes must always be inspired by those \u201cprimitive times of the Church.\u201d\n\nFollow In\u00e9s San Mart\u00edn on Twitter: @inesanma\n\nCrux is dedicated to smart, wired and independent reporting on the Vatican and worldwide Catholic Church.
