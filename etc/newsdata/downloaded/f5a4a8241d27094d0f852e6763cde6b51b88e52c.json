I did nothing wrong.\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cWhat I think is important is we focus on why it's so important to remove this man from office,\u201d he said on stage at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. \u201cThis president on three occasions, three occasions, has invited foreign governments and heads of government to get engaged in trying to alter our elections. The fact is that it is outrageous.\u201d\n\nIn an effort to push back on Trump\u2019s attacks on the Biden family and unsubstantiated claims of corruption, Hunter Biden appeared on Good Morning America Tuesday morning to vehemently dispute accusations that he or his father did anything improper when it came to his business dealings in Ukraine and China.\n\nThough he affirmed his father\u2019s assertions that there were no discussions between the two of Hunter\u2019s foreign business dealings, he did concede to showing \"poor judgment\" in working with foreign companies while his father was in office.\n\nNevertheless, Hunter Biden defended both his former positions on the boards of a Ukrainian natural gas company and of a China-based investment firm. Biden resigned from the latter over the weekend, pledging to not work for any foreign entities if his father wins the White House next year.\n\n\u201cI made a mistake, in retrospect, as it related to creating any perception that it was wrong, and so, therefore, I'm taking it off the table,\" he said in the interview that aired Tuesday. \"I'm making that commitment. We'll see if anybody else makes that commitment, but that's the commitment I'm making.\"", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/5e/32/1fb8a7944aac9698b35d4c1877b8/191015-debate-biden-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
