A week ago, the surprisingly excellent launch of Apple Arcade reminded people just how good mobile gaming could be when developers no longer had to worry about squeezing in ads or in-app purchases. In a mobile market almost completely dominated by free-to-play games that constantly demand time and money, Apple Arcade was a breath of fresh air. Mario Kart Tour, meanwhile, is a stark reminder of those dark days.\n\nAt its most basic, Mario Kart Tour is what it sounds like: a simplified Mario Kart you can play on your phone. It looks like Mario Kart, albeit with slightly sterile graphics, and you\u2019ll hear familiar tunes as you race. Power-ups like red shells and banana peels are still present, and if you\u2019re in first place you\u2019ll still need to be wary of blue shells.\n\nThat core is bland and inoffensive\n\nThe biggest change in terms of gameplay is that the entire experience is controlled via touch. Your kart will drive automatically, but you\u2019re able to control it by swiping left or right to turn. There are a few deeper mechanics \u2014 you can drift for a speed boost, for instance \u2014 but it\u2019s mostly very simple, and the controls are frustratingly imprecise. One good thing: using items is fairly intuitive, requiring a simple tap on the screen.\n\nYou progress through the game as you would in a typical Mario Kart game. There are a series of cup events, each of which involves a handful of races, and once you earn enough stars you\u2019ll unlock the next cup to play through. The tracks take place in familiar spots like Cheep Cheep Lagoon and Rock Rock Mountain, but, like the controls, they\u2019ve been extremely simplified. Whether you\u2019re speeding across a city or an underwater course, everything is straightforward. There\u2019s none of the inventive, manic creativity of Mario Kart 8 on display here.\n\nThat core is bland and inoffensive, doing just enough to feel like Mario Kart. The problem is so much of the game feels designed around monetization, as opposed to just being a fun game. This is particularly apparent when it comes to unlocking new characters and karts. Like so many of Nintendo\u2019s recent mobile efforts, Mario Kart Tour utilizes loot boxes. Spend a few rubies \u2014 the game\u2019s premium currency \u2014 and you can have the chance to get a random character or vehicle. Even worse, they\u2019ve turned the warp pipe, an iconic symbol of Super Mario, into a giant cannon that shoots out your mystery prize. There\u2019s also a store that cycles through different characters each day, which you can buy with coins collected during races or in a special mode that costs rubies to play.\n\n\u201cSuper Mario Run is going to introduce millions of more people to the fun of Mario.\u201d - Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto on bringing the series to iPhone\n\nThis is generally par for the course in mobile gaming today, of course. But it feels particularly irksome in a game series so full of unabashed joy like Mario Kart. The mobile iteration even goes a step farther by offering a $4.99 monthly subscription \u2014 the same price as Apple Arcade! \u2014 that gets you access to gold-tier items and a high-speed racing mode. It\u2019s sort of like Fortnite\u2019s battle pass, only a much worse deal. This all turns one of the best parts of Mario Kart \u2014 winning races to unlock new stuff \u2014 into a costly enterprise.\n\nThe sad state of Mario Kart Tour is part of a steady decline in Nintendo\u2019s mobile efforts. Things started off promising, with an iPhone version of Super Mario designed by none other than Shigeru Miyamoto, one that was sold in its entirety for $10. After that proved to be a failure, Nintendo pivoted to free-to-play with Fire Emblem Heroes and Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp. They were fun, Nintendo-quality games with mechanics like loot boxes tacked on \u2014 and they made a lot of money. Things have since taken a turn for the dire. In addition to Mario Kart Tour, earlier this year Nintendo launched a puzzle game that was essentially Dr. Mario-themed Candy Crush, and both games are aggressively monetized to the point that the actual game feels secondary.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean Mario Kart Tour won\u2019t be successful. In fact, early signs point to the game having a record-breaking launch. But that success isn\u2019t because the game is good, and it\u2019s especially disappointing from a company that prides itself on quality. Mobile aside, Nintendo is at a creative high point, regularly launching major Switch games to near-universal acclaim. They\u2019re games that sell hardware and help players think differently about what games can be. On console, Nintendo sets its own pace; on mobile, it follows.", "description": "Mario Kart Tour is the latest iPhone and Android game from Nintendo, and it saddles the classic racing series with aggressive free-to-play mechanics that sap the joy out of the experience.", "authors": ["Andrew Webster", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/80A5JYnEF9-ompXHnZfPiorauEQ=/0x488:2048x1560/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19234878/mobile_MarioKartTour_screen_07_png_jpgcopy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
