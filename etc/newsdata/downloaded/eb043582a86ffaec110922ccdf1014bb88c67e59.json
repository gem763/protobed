That has contributed to an impeachment inquiry against him.\n\nTurns out Trump favors bogus economic theories, too.\n\nTwo years ago, Trump predicted the Republican tax cut would raise family incomes by $4,000 a year, on average. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be fantastic for the economy,\u201d he said at a White House signing ceremony on Dec. 22, 2017. \u201cThe numbers will speak.\u201d\n\nThe numbers have now spoken, and it\u2019s more like a hiss. Gross domestic product grew a scant 1.9% in the third quarter, signaling a slowdown in the economy since Trump cut taxes. Economic growth under Trump actually peaked at the end of 2017, right before the tax cut went into effect. It came close to that high in the second quarter of 2018, when GDP grew at a 3.5% annualized rate. But growth has been drifting down ever since. The economy grew just 2.9% for the full year in 2018, and it\u2019s on pace for perhaps 2% growth for the full year in 2019. Trump predicted he\u2019d boost GDP growth to at least 3% and possibly 4%.\n\nA brief uptick in growth under Trump is now retreating to Obama-era levels. More\n\nTrump and his fellow Republicans also predicted a boom in business investment that would trickle down to workers and result in that big wage gain. Again, there was a small bump in investment in the middle of 2018, but this too has fallen sharply. Nonresidential fixed investment, a proxy for business spending, fell 3% in the third quarter. \u201cReal spending on business equipment has slowed sharply,\u201d Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, explained to clients. \u201cWe expect no near-term relief.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. manufacturing sector has actually contracted during the last two months. Manufacturing employment has flatlined this year, and anecdotal reports of layoffs suggest a bigger decline could be coming. Overall, the pace of job growth has slowed from an average of 216,000 new jobs per month during President Obama\u2019s second term to 188,000 under Trump, and just 161,000 so far in 2019.\n\nWhat about wages? Nothing special. They\u2019re up 2.9% during the last 12 months, an improvement over the 2.2% annual average during Obama\u2019s second term. Factoring out inflation leaves workers with a real wage gain of 1.2% during the last year. Based on median household income of $61,937, that\u2019s a windfall of $743. Only $3,257 left to go.\n\nShare buybacks and big deficits\n\nCritics of the GOP tax cuts have pointed out that instead of investing, many corporations used the spare cash to buy back shares and boost dividends. Buybacks, in fact, hit a record in 2018. But even that boomlet is waning, with buybacks slowing sharply this year. That\u2019s one reason some analysts worry stocks could sputter into 2020.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks at the International Association of Chiefs of Police Convention Monday, Oct. 28, 2019, in Chicago.

In a growing economy, the gap between government spending and borrowing should decline. In the late 1990s, there were even four years of federal surpluses. Under Trump, however, deficits have risen from $665 billion in 2017 to $984 billion in 2019. Federal revenue from income taxes has risen, but revenue from corporate taxes has fallen 23% since Trump signed the tax cut. Trump and others said the tax cuts would stimulate so much new activity that tax receipts would actually rise. They were wrong.\n\nWhile business spending has tanked, consumer spending has held up. Job security remains solid and workers feel okay about their prospects. But consumers are wary of Trump\u2019s trade war with China, cautious about the future and gloomy about the direction of the country.
