Blaming a group of police eager to nab Guzman without consideration for the cartel\u2019s reaction, Durazo called the arrest attempt a \u201cfailure,\u201d pointing out that they didn\u2019t even wait for a search warrant before rushing into the house.\n\nAlso on rt.com Mexican security forces flee after cartel gunmen launch WAR to release El Chapo\u2019s son at drug lord\u2019s bastion Culiacan (GRAPHIC)\n\nA lawyer for the Guzman family said they would cover medical expenses for the wounded \u2013 and funeral expenses for the dead. \u201cThe family apologizes to the people of Sinaloa, and particularly to the people of Culiacan,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Luis Gonz\u00e1lez Meza told a news conference on Friday.\n\n\u201cThe message of the family, and of the mother of \u2018El Chapo', Mar\u00eda Consuelo, and (the mother) of Ovidio, Griselda L\u00f3pez, is of thanks to the President of the Republic, L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2026 We have a human, Christian president, who finally did not make the decision to harm Ovidio.\u201d Another family lawyer, Juan Pablo Badillo, praised \u201ca manly order, an intelligent order, a sensible order\u201d given by the president to release Guzman.\n\nSecurity minister Alfonso Durazo just said in a press conference that there was \u201cno agreement\u201d with the narcos in this situation.
