It\u2019s not that China was Denmark. Corruption was, indeed, woven into the fabric of government and economy. But Xi\u2019s war on corruption was waged against carefully and selectively picked targets. The campaign provided Xi with cover to hurl rivals into jail and to install his own cronies. When The New York Times reported on Xi\u2019s anti-corruption campaign, it described it as a tool \u201cto imprison rivals, instill fear within the party establishment and set himself up as the nation\u2019s most powerful leader in decades.\u201d In the name of anti-corruption, Xi purged the party and remade the top ranks of his military. He presided over a seemingly endless cycle of anxiety-inducing investigations, glorified in state propaganda.\n\nFranklin Foer: Trump\u2019s classic bully move\n\nOr take Ukraine. The country has undoubtedly reformed itself since the reign of Viktor Yanukovych, the kleptocrat exiled in the revolution of 2014. Its new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, ran on a platform of sweeping away graft and passed reforms in his earliest days in office. Still, the country has a recent track record of appointing prosecutors who serve the agenda of oligarchic forces and exploit their powers to target reformers in civil society.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign chair Paul Manafort was a resolute defender of the arbitrary prosecution of rival politicians. During his time as a consultant working for Yanukovych, Manafort helped justify his client\u2019s dubious imprisonment of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko. Manafort hired Barack Obama\u2019s former White House counsel Greg Craig to write a brief justifying her arrest\u2014and he made it his job to share Craig\u2019s findings with reporters and lawmakers in Washington and Brussels. Yanukovych wanted to punish his rival, to shred her credibility, and to imperil her political future. Is it really a surprise that Trump would find himself drawn to Ukraine in his quest to achieve a variation of this same objective?\n\nIt\u2019s heartening that Trump hasn\u2019t yet been able to fully exploit American institutions to execute his smear tactics\u2014and that he has needed to enlist foreign governments in his gambits. And it\u2019s further heartening that China and Ukraine seem unwilling to truly play along with his scheme. The Chinese have declined to meddle in American domestic politics, and the Ukrainians have issued a half-hearted statement vowing to audit a swath of past cases, which includes Hunter Biden\u2019s energy firm. What\u2019s disturbing, however, is the convergence of tactics. Like his corrupt brethren around the world, Trump intended to protect himself against accusations of his own corruption by deflecting the charge onto his rival. This was always the nightmare scenario lurking in the \u201cLock her up!\u201d chants.", "description": "The president is following the template employed by other autocrats to destroy their rivals.", "authors": ["Franklin Foer", "Staff Writer For"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTX765DN/facebook.jpg?1570457392", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
