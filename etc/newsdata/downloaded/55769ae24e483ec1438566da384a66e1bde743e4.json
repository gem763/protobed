Any reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Iran could have far-reaching consequences for conflicts across the region.\n\nIt was President Donald Trump\u2019s refusal to retaliate against Iran for the Sept. 14 attack, analysts say, that set off unintended consequences, prompting Saudi Arabia to seek its own solution to the conflict. That solution, in turn, could subvert Trump\u2019s effort to build an Arab alliance to isolate Iran.\n\nIn recent weeks, officials of Iraq and Pakistan said, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman asked the leaders of those two countries to speak with their Iranian counterparts about de-escalation.\n\nIran welcomed the gestures, stating privately and publicly that it was open to talks with Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn a statement to The New York Times on Friday, the Saudi government acknowledged that Iraq and Pakistan had offered to mediate talks between the two countries but denied that Crown Prince Mohammed had taken the initiative.\n\n\u201cEfforts at de-escalation must emanate from the party that began the escalation and launched attacks, not the kingdom,\u201d the statement said.\n\nDistrust between the two Middle Eastern powers remains intense, and the prospect of high-level direct talks anytime soon appears remote. But even a slight warming could echo far outside their respective borders, where their rivalry fuels political divides from Lebanon to Yemen.\n\nIran has long wanted to wrest the Saudis from their alliance with Iran\u2019s archenemies, Israel and the United States, who are waging a \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign against Iran to try to force it to restrict its nuclear program and stop backing militias in the region.\n\nIran\u2019s receptiveness for contact with the Saudis contrasts with its chilly tone toward the United States. Last week, Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, dodged an opportunity to speak directly with Trump while both were attending the United Nations General Assembly in New York.\n\nThe new overtures between Saudi Arabia and Iran began in the aftermath of last month\u2019s drone and cruise missile strikes on two Saudi oil facilities, which Saudi Arabia and the United States accused Iran of orchestrating.\n\nDespite tough threats by the Trump administration, the president declined to order a military response. The demurral raised questions for the Saudis about the U.S. commitment to Saudi security, which has underpinned the strategic layout of the Persian Gulf for decades.\n\nPrime Minister Imran Khan of Pakistan met with Crown Prince Mohammed, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, in Jiddah last month. Days later, while Khan was at the General Assembly, he told reporters that the crown prince had asked him to talk to Iran.\n\nCrown Prince Mohammed told Khan, \u201cI want to avoid war,\u201d according to a senior Pakistani official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to reporters. \u201cHe asked the prime minister to get involved.\u201d\n\nKhan then spoke with Rouhani on the sidelines of the General Assembly.\n\nThe Iraqi prime minister, Adel Abdul Mahdi, visited Saudi Arabia a few days after Khan did.\n\nA senior Iraqi official said that Crown Prince Mohammed asked Abdul Mahdi to mediate with Iran and that Iraq had suggested Baghdad as the venue for a potential meeting.\n\n\u201cThere is a big response from Saudi Arabia and from Iran and even from Yemen,\u201d Abdul Mahdi told journalists in Iraq after his return from the kingdom. \u201cAnd I think that these endeavors will have a good effect.\u201d\n\nIran endorsed the idea.\n\n\u201cIran is open to starting a dialogue with Saudi Arabia and other countries in the region,\u201d Ali Larijani, the speaker of Iran\u2019s Parliament, told Al Jazeera in an interview broadcast Tuesday. \u201cAn Iranian-Saudi dialogue,\u201d he added, \u201ccould solve many of the region\u2019s security and political problems.\u201d\n\nWhile they explore back-channel possibilities, both sides have continued to stake out staunchly opposing public positions.", "description": "After years of growing hostility and competition for influence, Saudi Arabia and Iran have taken steps toward indirect talks to try to reduce the tensions that have brought the Middle East to the brink of war, according to officials from several countries involved in the efforts.Even the prospect of", "authors": ["Farnaz Fassihi", "Ben Hubbard"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jjz.E7_29SGKzspXVL0I0Q--~B/aD0zMDAwO3c9NDUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/2f1aa05cbc1f971ca58d3da77249c550", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
