He also had seven assists and five rebounds, and finished the preseason averaging 31.5 points.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the way he\u2019s wired,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cHe loves to play. I couldn\u2019t take him out in the fourth quarter if I wanted to. He\u2019d play 48 if he could. He\u2019s wired that way. He gets better every time. I don\u2019t know what his ceiling is. But he\u2019s, to me, the most improved player every year. He\u2019s just ridiculous.\u201d\n\nThe Rockets didn\u2019t get out of the game unscathed, however. Austin Rivers could play only seven minutes before being downgraded to out with neck soreness, and Westbrook - who has been dealing with some dislocated fingers on his right hand - left the game in the fourth quarter in obvious discomfort.\n\nWestbrook lost the ball, immediately grabbed at his right hand, then ran off the court and straight into the tunnel leading to the Rockets\u2019 locker room without stopping. He finished with 16 points, four rebounds and four assists on 6-for-13 shooting in 26 minutes.\n\n\u201cBoth of them told me they were OK, so we\u2019ll take that,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said.\n\nD\u2019Antoni said Westbrook aggravated the finger issue, and will be fine. A top task for the Rockets in this preseason was figuring out all the ways to best utilize their new point guard, with D\u2019Antoni acknowledged is still a bit of a work in progress.\n\n\u201cI was with him for eight summers in USA Basketball,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cHe\u2019s a great guy. Works hard. Unbelievable athletically. Just the speed and power that he can play with \u2026 he\u2019s relentless.\u201d\n\nSome of D\u2019Antoni\u2019s favorite moments during Westbrook\u2019s brief Houston tenure so far have been ones that few people have seen - since they\u2019ve come in practice, in moments where the competitive juices have perhaps overflowed.\n\n\u201cHe gets ticked off in practice sometimes and the next 3 minutes, he\u2019s killing people,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cHe needs that competitiveness to juice him up. He\u2019s not like the old guy at the Y who will knock you down and shoot it. No, no, he\u2019s coming at you with all the athleticism that he has.\u201d\n\nWestbrook will have a few extra days to get through the issue with his fingers. He and the Rockets don\u2019t open the regular season until playing host to Milwaukee on Thursday.\n\nEric Gordon scored 23 points for Houston and Clint Capela finished with 20 points and 13 rebounds.\n\nKendrick Nunn scored 40 points in 40 minutes for Miami, making 15 of 27 shots. Tyler Herro scored 14 points and Bam Adebayo made all six of his shots on the way to a 13-point, 11-rebound night.\n\nJimmy Butler didn\u2019t play for the Heat, held out to rest.\n\nPRESEASON STANDINGS\n\nFriday\u2019s slate marked the end of the preseason, with Milwaukee (5-0), New Orleans (5-0), Boston (4-0), and Denver (4-0) all finishing unbeaten.\n\nThe regular season starts Tuesday when NBA champion Toronto getting its rings before playing host to New Orleans, followed by the Lakers and Clippers meeting in the first battle of Los Angeles this season.\n\nFRIDAY\u2019S GAMES\n\nPELICANS 117, KNICKS 116\n\nNickell Alexander-Walker and Josh Hart each scored 17 points, and New Orleans wrapped up an unbeaten preseason without injured No. 1 pick Zion Williamson.\n\nWilliamson has a sore right knee and remained in New Orleans to undergo further testing and evaluation. Coach Alvin Gentry said he didn\u2019t have any update on the power forward\u2019s condition, though ESPN.com reported Friday, citing sources, that Williamson would miss multiple weeks.\n\nEven without him, the Pelicans (5-0) put up plenty of points after coming into the game scoring a league-leading 127.8 per game during the preseason. Brandon Ingram scored 16 points and JJ Redick had 14.\n\nWilliamson looked as good as advertised while averaging 23.3 points on 71.4% shooting in four preseason games, and Gentry was asked if he was concerned the injury would dampen enthusiasm in New Orleans.\n\n\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s not anything that we can worry about,\u201d Gentry said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got games to play and bottom line is that we will be in Toronto in a few days playing on opening night and we\u2019ll have to put five guys out there and play.\u201d\n\nJulius Randle had 20 points and nine rebounds against his former team, but missed a 3-pointer that would have won it at the buzzer for the Knicks (1-3). Rookie RJ Barrett, the No. 3 pick who was Williamson\u2019s Duke teammate, added 19 points.\n\nWIZARDS 112, 76ERS 93\n\nJordan McRae scored 17 points and Thomas Bryant finished with 15 points and 10 rebounds for Washington. Moritz Wagner scored 14 and Bradley Beal - one day after signing a $72 million, two-year extension - scored 13 for the Wizards.\n\nJoel Embiid scored 17 points in 23 minutes for Philadelphia, which played without Ben Simmons. Tobias Harris had 13 for the 76ers.\n\nRAPTORS 123, NETS 107\n\nOG Anunoby scored 18 points and Toronto had nine players score at least nine points.\n\nFred VanVleet scored 16 points and handed out eight assists for Toronto, which got 15 points and 11 rebounds from Serge Ibaka. Kyle Lowry got his first - and only - action of the preseason, scoring nine points in 26 minutes.\n\nKyrie Irving got his first extended action of the preseason for Brooklyn, scoring 19 points in 25 minutes. Irving played only 66 seconds in the Nets\u2019 first game against the Los Angeles Lakers in China last week before aggravating a facial fracture and not playing on the remainder of that trip.\n\nSome fans at the game wore shirts, held signs and chanted in support of Hong Kong during the Nets\u2019 first game since returning from China. One sign was critical of Nets owner Joe Tsai, co-founder of the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, who had written a Facebook post explaining why Houston general manager Daryl Morey\u2019s tweet in support of Hong Kong protesters was upsetting to Chinese.\n\nSPURS 104, GRIZZLIES 91\n\nPatty Mills was 4 of 5 from 3-point range and scored 16 points, and LaMarcus Aldridge had 14 points and 11 rebounds for San Antonio.\n\nDeMar DeRozan and Bryn Forbes added 14 points each and Rudy Gay scored 13 points for the Spurs (2-3).\n\nJa Morant had 16 points and six assists, Jae Crowder added 11 points and 11 rebounds, and Brandon Clarke had 11 points and 10 rebounds for the Grizzlies (3-2).\n\nWARRIORS 124, LAKERS 103\n\nStephen Curry scored 32 points and D\u2019Angelo Russell added 29 for Golden State, each making six 3-pointers.\n\nThe Warriors (2-3) took the lead early in the second quarter and held off a run that got the Lakers (3-3) within five points early in the fourth. Glenn Robinson III had 13 points and Draymond Green had nine points and 12 rebounds.\n\nZach Norvell Jr. made 5 of 10 from 3-point range and scored 29 points for Los Angeles. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope added 25 points and Devontae Cacok had 16 points and 10 rebounds.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "James Harden sure seems in midseason form.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tim Reynolds"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/18/rockets_heat_basketball_16469_c0-120-4000-2453_s1200x700.jpg?577411144e7706c447337ebb8fc6b85aa1877991", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
