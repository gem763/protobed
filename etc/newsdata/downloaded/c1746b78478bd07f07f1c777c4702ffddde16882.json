You need budgeting skills\n\nThe first thing to do, the very first thing, before finding the student union or even packing your bags is to understand your budget.\n\nHow much will you have to get you through each term? How does that break down week by week? What are your bills? What income will you have beyond your student loan? How much actual free cash will you have to spend on going out?\n\nThis is the single most empowering thing you can do for your finances because it puts you in control. There are online guides, spreadsheets and even apps that will help you with this.\n\nIt really is the difference between managing your money smoothly over the year and ending up in real difficulties because you didn\u2019t. Even if you disregard the rest of this article, understanding and sticking to a budget could transform your student finances.\n\n2. You shouldn\u2019t have to pay taxes (assuming you\u2019re not overworking!)\n\nHow many hours are you planning to work? Students are not exempt from taxes, they are liable for income tax and national insurance just like anyone else.\n\nBut the good news is that all workers are allowed to earn a certain amount without paying taxes.\n\nThe current personal allowance is \u00a312,500, so as long as you\u2019re earning less than that across a tax year then you shouldn\u2019t have to pay taxes.\n\nMost universities recommend students don\u2019t work more than 15 hours a week, so many students earn less than the threshold and don\u2019t have to pay taxes or get a refund on them.\n\n3. You can get a railcard\n\nIf you\u2019re going to travel home a lot then it\u2019s really worth investing in a 16-25 Railcard. It costs \u00a330 a year or \u00a370 for three years (money-saving tip right there) and you may be able to get one if you\u2019re a mature student too.\n\nWith this card you can get discounts of a third on the price of railway travel across the UK. If you\u2019re travelling a long way then you could save the cost of the card back in just one journey.\n\n4. You need contents insurance. You really do\n\nI know, you think you need another bill like you need a hole in the head. But the National Union of Students says one in five students fall victim to crime while studying at college or university and the average cost of a break-in standing at \u00a3900 to repair the damage and replace belongings.\n\nDon\u2019t panic about the risk and let it spoil your excitement. Do make sure you\u2019re protected with a decent contents insurance policy just in case it does.\n\n5. That (financial) knowledge is (financial) power\n\nIt\u2019s really easy to let financial control slip during university \u2013 there are so many distractions. But if you can get in the habit of regularly checking your bank balance you will be much better off.\n\nKnowing how much cash you have and what the state of your overdraft is will be key to your financial health throughout your course.\n\n6. You shouldn\u2019t just bank with the branch on campus\n\nMost banks offer a student account but it\u2019s tempting to simply pick whichever one has a branch on or near campus.\n\nBut taking the time to find the right account for your particular needs is essential and thanks to apps and internet banking it\u2019s not as urgent for most to have immediate access to a branch.\n\nA bit of time spent assessing which is the right account for you will really help you manage your money throughout your studies. If you need to use an overdraft then make sure you look for the account with the cheapest one. But if you can budget without an overdraft then it is far better to do so.\n\nNationwide and Santander offer the best accounts for students right now, according to analysis by Which? But it\u2019s worth spending some time assessing which account is right for you and what you need.\n\n7. You have rights when renting\n\nAlthough you\u2019re probably in official university accommodation for the first year, after that you may end up in the private rented sector.\n\nIt\u2019s so important to know your financial rights when you do that so you don\u2019t end up being ripped off.\n\nLetting agents and landlords can\u2019t charge upfront fees anymore, so if any try to then you should be extremely suspicious. And your landlord should be placing your deposit within an official deposit protection scheme, meaning they can\u2019t just arbitrarily keep it.\n\nSome student accommodation will be let with bills included but a lot of rented flats and rooms won\u2019t. If bills aren\u2019t included then you need to proactively sort out your various contracts from gas and electricity, to council tax and broadband.\n\nMake sure your flatmates all understand any shared commitments so they can be budgeted for properly.\n\n8. Register to vote\n\nNot only will registering to vote ensure that you can participate in any upcoming elections \u2013 particularly important given how many people are predicting an early general election \u2013 it will also help your finances.\n\nBeing on the electoral roll will boost your credit score as it confirms your address and makes you a safer person to lend to. That\u2019s not just for casual debt, which you should avoid if you can.\n\nIt can also help you qualify for car insurance, mobile phone contracts and more, so it\u2019s really worth doing. It only takes a moment, too \u2013 this is one of the easiest wins in this whole article.\n\n9. Help is available\n\nLots of undergraduates find themselves in difficulties, so if you do find yourself struggling financially then you are not alone.\n\nGetting help can be the difference between graduating with money problems and graduating with your finances are under control.\n\nIf you are struggling, if it is causing you anxiety, if it is distracting you from your studies and affecting your mental health then get some help. Talk to your bank, they will be used to helping people like you. Talk to whatever student support your university offers.\n\nYou may be able to talk to a student money adviser, check out the National Association of Student Money Advisers (NASMA) website to find one.\n\n10. University is more fun if you\u2019re in control\n\nTaking time to plan your finances before Freshers\u2019 Week may not be as exciting as packing. But money worries can cause stress and anxiety, which can wreck your undergrad experience.\n\nDeciding to be financial sensible during your undergrad years will reduce your worries and mean you have more fun.\n\nThat may mean staying in a few nights when your friends are out burning a hole into their overdrafts but you\u2019ll be in better shape by the end of your degree \u2013 and less stressed during your studies.", "description": "If you are just weeks away from starting university then there\u2019s a lot to think about.
