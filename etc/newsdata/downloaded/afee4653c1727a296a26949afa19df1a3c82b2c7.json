Sign up here.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s protesters aren\u2019t satisfied with Carrie Lam\u2019s concession, Boris Johnson\u2019s early election bid flops, and Michael Burry of \u201cThe Big Short\u201d fame sees a bubble ahead in passive index funds. Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about today.\n\nNot Enough\n\nHong Kong\u2019s embattled leader Carrie Lam has at last scrapped the controversial China extradition bill that sparked the historic unrest that has gripped the city for three months \u2014 but it\u2019s not enough for the protesters. Not only is the concession seen as \u201ctoo little, too late,\u201d pro-democracy activists say they still want for their other four demands met, most significantly a longstanding push to nominate and elect their own leaders \u2014 a proposal Beijing explicitly ruled out this week. China has, however, struck a softer tone in relation to the protests. Meanwhile, investors reacted with glee as stocks surged the most since 2011. Don\u2019t get too excited yet though: most analysts saw the jump as a temporary bounce for a market that has been battered in recent months.\n\nMarkets To Lift\n\nStocks in Asia looked primed to start Thursday on the front foot, after a broad rally in global equities amid an improvement in investor sentiment. The dollar dropped the most since June. Futures signaled gains for shares in Japan and Australia, and Hong Kong contracts pointed lower after a 4% surge Wednesday when Carrie Lam formally withdrew legislation to allow extraditions to China. U.S. stocks closed higher and Treasuries slipped. The pound surged as Britain\u2019s parliament rejected Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s demand for an early election and took further steps to block an imminent no-deal Brexit. Meanwhile, China signaled that a reduction in the amount of funds banks have to hold in reserve is on the way. The calls come as more and more economists lower their GDP forecasts for 2020 to below 6%. Elsewhere, oil climbed above $56 a barrel.\n\nEarly Election Flops\n\nBoris Johnson has suffered another blow to his questionable Brexit strategy \u2014 his third defeat in just 24 hours. The U.K. prime minister failed in his attempt to trigger a snap general election after fewer than half of Parliament supported him. He needed at least two-thirds of members to back him up. Speaking after the loss, Johnson blamed his rival, opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, for refusing to support the proposed election. \u201cHe does not think he will win,\u201d Johnson said. The prime minister\u2019s call for a snap poll came after MPs moved decisively to stop Britain lurching out of the European Union without an agreement in eight weeks\u2019 time. The decision looks like it could painfully drag out the timeline yet again. Former PM Theresa May, who stood down earlier this year, faced criticism from MPs for continually kicking the Brexit can down the road, so to speak.\n\nBurry\u2019s Latest Bubble\n\nThe hero of \u201cThe Big Short\u201d thinks index funds are like subprime CDOs. That means a lot, coming from someone who made his fortune and fame betting against CDOs before the crisis. Michael Burry\u2019s thesis puts forward the idea of a bubble brewing in the index arena. He points to dangerous parallels between the recent flood of money into index funds and the pre-2008 bubble in collateralized debt obligations, the complex securities that almost destroyed the global financial system. \u201cLike most bubbles, the longer it goes on, the worse the crash will be,\u201d he said. That\u2019s why Burry, who oversees about $340 million at Scion Asset Management in Cupertino, California, prefers small-cap value stocks: they tend to be under-represented in passive funds.\n\nManagement Risks\n\nAsset managers in Asia registered their slowest growth in seven years in 2018, as weaker equity markets damped performance and geopolitical turmoil caused volatility to spike. What\u2019s more, asset-management firms\u2019 profits could decline by around 10% over the coming five years. That\u2019s according to McKinsey & Co. But that\u2019s no reason for firms to shy away from investing in the region, they said. Firms just need to be aware of how to navigate some specific disruptions. Asia still dominates global growth, attracting 77% of flows, or about $1.5 trillion, in 2018, but McKinsey Senior Partner Jacob Dahl said companies should think about scaling up, and employ more fee flexibility through expanding product offerings, should they want to remain competitive.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Want the lowdown on what's moving Asian\u00a0markets in your inbox every morning?\u00a0Sign up here.Hong Kong\u2019s protesters aren\u2019t satisfied with Carrie Lam\u2019s concession, Boris Johnson\u2019s early election bid flops, and Michael Burry of \u201cThe Big Short\u201d fame sees a bubble ahead in passive index funds", "authors": ["Sybilla Gross"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/WnEBWN5w6wVwrjG_0O8g4Q--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/video/bloomberg_politics_video_969/4814478f27555e9186e9236056e192dd"}
