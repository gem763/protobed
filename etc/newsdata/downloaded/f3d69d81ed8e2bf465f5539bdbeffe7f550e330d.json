I bring no makeup and just my sweats and hang out.\u201d\n\nThough Kardashian West\u2019s rapper husband recently purchased a sprawling ranch in Wyoming, the reality star doesn\u2019t plan on moving there full-time with daughters North West, 6, and Chicago West, 19 months, and sons Saint West, 3\u00bd and Psalm West, 4 months.\n\n\u201cKim is definitely not moving and living full-time in Wyoming right now. Kim likes visiting Wyoming, but she sees it more like a vacation place,\u201d a source told PEOPLE. \u201cIt\u2019s very quiet and private.\u201d\n\nThe source added: \u201cEvery time they go, they enjoy it. But they are usually comfortable in luxury housing. The ranch only has simple housing. It\u2019s mostly cabins with no amenities at all. Kim just isn\u2019t a fan of the cabins.\u201d\n\nDuring an appearance on The Tonight Show earlier this month, Kardashian West said she envisions spending summers and weekends in the Midwest.\n\n\u201cI love L.A., so I envision summers, I envision some weekends [in Wyoming],\u201d she told Jimmy Fallon. \u201cBut yeah, we love it. It\u2019s like, the prettiest place you\u2019ve seen in your entire life. Even my sisters, everyone, we\u2019ve had this dream of getting a ranch and just spending our summers there and getting away.\u201d\n\nThe 71st Primetime Emmy Awards are airing live from the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles starting at 8 p.m. ET/PT on Fox.", "description": "Kim Kardashian Says She Wears 'No Makeup' and Only Sweats When She's in Wyoming with Family", "authors": ["Kaitlyn Frey"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qVw_vVUVYbwYhHPATaXNmA--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/35ce631f68db4930f4bdf659bb5c844e", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
