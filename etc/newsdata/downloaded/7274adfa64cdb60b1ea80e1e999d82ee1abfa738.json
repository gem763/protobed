(Clay Lisenby)\n\nEvery day, hungry people form a line outside Drexell & Honeybee\u2019s restaurant in Alabama before it opens for lunch. There are no prices on the menu. That\u2019s because diners can pay whatever they want.\n\nSome people slip $3 or $5 into the donation box, some pay nothing, and some serve food in exchange for their fresh meals. And sometimes, the owners are surprised with checks worth $500 \u2014 or one time, even $1,000. People often drop homegrown produce, unsolicited, at the door.\n\nAt Drexell & Honeybee\u2019s, the menu doesn\u2019t even list suggested donation prices.\n\n\u201cIf you come into a restaurant, and you don\u2019t have any money, and you sit down and see our suggested price, what are you going to do?\u201d owner Lisa Thomas-McMillan, 66, said. \u201cIt keeps the people away that absolutely, truly need it.\u201d\n\n\n\nLisa Thomas-McMillan and Freddie McMillan getting ready to serve lunch at Drexell & Honeybee's. (Clay Lisenby)\n\nThomas-McMillan and her husband and co-owner, Freddie McMillan \u2014 both retirees \u2014 have been serving meals since March 2018 at their nonprofit restaurant, where the motto is \u201cWe Feed the Need.\u201d\n\nTuesdays through Fridays, the volunteer-staffed eatery \u2014 located in Brewton, Ala., a city of about 5,500 just north of the Florida Panhandle \u2014 serves meals to almost 100 people a day.\n\nThose who pay do it anonymously with a box located behind a divider, so that nobody \u2014 not even the restaurant workers \u2014 knows whether they paid and how much. The most common donation is $5.\n\n\u201cI have found out \u2026 a lot of elderly people are coming hungry, because a lot of them can\u2019t pay for their medicine and buy food. Food stamps are not adequate,\u201d said Lisa Thomas-McMillan, who spent most of her working life as a waitress.\n\nBusinesses and individuals in the community have helped the restaurant since it opened by donating food, money and produce. Lately, the restaurant has been getting two to three mailed donations every day \u2014 mostly for amounts like $10.\n\n[This 13-year-old opened a bakery. For every cupcake he sells, he gives one to the homeless.]\n\nAround 2016, Thomas-McMillan was serving lunches at a local community college \u2014 free for those who could not afford to buy meals \u2014 to mostly students. Then, one day, three older people came in, digging through their purses for change and breaking up rolls of dimes and nickels. They were hungry, she said, but could barely afford to pay.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t take that [money], because I knew it had to be their last,\u201d Thomas-McMillan said.\n\nSo, she said she told them: \u201cCan you help us out? We need to give away at least 10 free meals.\u201d\n\nThe story did the trick and got the seniors to accept the food. It also did something else: inspired Thomas-McMillan to open the restaurant she had been thinking about for a few years.\n\n[This couple enjoys Texas Roadhouse so much they trained themselves to eat almost nothing else, day or night]\n\nWhen she thought about what she\u2019d call it, the quirky name Drexell & Honeybee\u2019s popped into her head, and she settled on it, she said. The name has no special meaning or muse.\n\nAs she had hoped, many of Drexell & Honeybee\u2019s customers are elderly.\n\nAccording to the nonprofit Feeding America, nearly 8.6 million Americans 60 and older were marginally food insecure in 2016. Alabama ranks second in the top 10 states for moderate food insecurity, with an estimated 12.8 percent of seniors there considered food insecure, according to the study.\n\nOne of those people is retiree Betty McCreary, 66, who eats at Drexell & Honeybee\u2019s almost every day it\u2019s open and especially likes the grilled chicken. She can\u2019t afford to pay for the meals, but volunteers to help clean up.\n\n\u201cI put a little something like a dollar in the box when I have it,\u201d said McCreary, who lives in Evergreen, Ala., about 25 miles from Brewton.\n\nThe restaurant\u2019s owners, who do all of the cooking, make up the recipes as they go based on diner feedback. The ever-changing menu includes such dishes as macaroni and cheese, fresh greens, squash, okra, beef stew, mashed potatoes and peach cobbler. Thomas-McMillan and her husband start cooking on business days at 5 a.m.\n\nWord has spread about Drexell & Honeybee\u2019s, and people are coming from outside of town to eat there, she said.\n\n\n\nLisa Thomas-McMillan, far right, with customers Michelle Nelson, Maren Seaquist and Susan Niclas, who drove 70 miles from Robertsdale, Ala., to eat and talk about opening their own cafe. (Freddie McMillan)\n\nOne couple dropped a note in the box saying they saw a story about the restaurant in the media and wanted to spend their wedding anniversary there. The food was awesome, and the people are friendly, said the note, written on a loose napkin. The couple probably dropped some money in the box separately, Thomas-McMillan said.\n\nShe loves displaying the notes people put in the donation box, like the one that credited Drexell & Honeybee\u2019s for allowing a family of four to eat that day. Another note had a quarter attached to it and called the restaurant a blessing to the community.\n\n\n\nA note from a Drexell & Honeybee's customer. (Freddie McMillan)\n\nRunning a business, especially a charitable one with limited revenue, is challenging financially, Thomas-McMillan said. When Drexell & Honeybee\u2019s first opened, the owners thought if they took in about $200 a day, it would be adequate. On a typical day, however, they get an average of about $110, Thomas-McMillan said.\n\nThe owners don\u2019t take a salary from the restaurant; they run it as a charity project and rely on Social Security and military retirement funds from McMillan\u2019s career in the Marines to pay their own bills. Sometimes, the couple invests some of their own money in the restaurant.\n\nDrexell & Honeybee\u2019s is part of Carlisa Inc., Thomas-McMillan\u2019s 501c3 nonprofit ministry that started in 2002 with a food bank located inside the church she attends, Zion Fountain African Methodist Episcopal Church. She still runs the food bank, along with her restaurant.\n\nHer Christian faith is a large motivation for her charity, Thomas-McMillan said.\n\nEvery day, when she feeds people, she gets a \u201cfeeling of fullness.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just feel like, when we\u2019re down here, that we\u2019re doing something so important and something just joyful,\u201d she said. \u201cEating and fellowshipping with each other \u2026 it\u2019s just the best feeling in the world.\n\n\u201cWe are fulfilling our lives in service of others,\u201d she said. She wrote a book, titled \u201cLiving Fulfilled: The Infectious Joy of Serving Others,\u201d which she sells at the restaurant.\n\n[This restaurant is starting a monthly \u2018dementia friendly\u2019 night]\n\nEvery day, Drexell & Honeybee\u2019s needs at least three volunteers to help run the business. Dale LaGrant, 64, is often up for the job.\n\nLaGrant both eats there and volunteers, making iced tea, serving water, setting tables and helping customers with mobility limitations. After the restaurant stops serving at 1 p.m., she helps clean up the front section.\n\nLaGrant is on a fixed income from Social Security, and usually, she donates $3 to $5 per lunch. LaGrant \u2014 who comes for McMillan\u2019s chicken pot pie and bread pudding \u2014 said she sees people of all races, ages and economic levels. Many are daily regulars.\n\n\n\nCustomer Cornelius Samuel, left, and Lisa Thomas-McMillan at Drexell & Honeybee's. (Freddie McMillan)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a family setting,\u201d said LaGrant, of Castleberry, Ala., a town about 15 miles from Brewton. \u201cWe walk in, and you may not know someone\u2019s name, and they will smile and say \u2018Hi\u2019 to you. It\u2019s the same faces almost every day.\u201d\n\n[A restaurant gave a birthday discount to 109-year-old woman \u2014 and ended up owing her money]\n\nMcMillan, 68, says he loves working with his wife at the restaurant: The hidden donation system gives people privacy who may feel too ashamed to eat a free meal, he says \u2014 and they shouldn\u2019t be.\n\n\u201cRegardless of who you are, you\u2019re welcome,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s everyone\u2019s restaurant.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nA kid was teased for his homemade University of Tennessee logo.
