Pictured at the premiere of Bloom in Sydney in November 2018\n\n'Andrew Johns didn't want to be on The Footy Show.

He's clever.'\n\nBeau, who also worked as a presenter on The NRL Footy Show, said Andrew had told him he was keen to be in the thick of the action.\n\nRumoured feud: It comes amid reports Andrew (right) dislikes working with Erin (left) and quit The NRL Footy Show because he didn't want her being the main presenter\n\n'We had the live [Footy Show] on Thursday night last year and the game was on before us,' he explained.\n\n'I was out the back with him before the show and he wanted to be at the games.

You've got to remember she was one of the first women to come in and work in NRL,' he said.", "description": "He's been a vocal advocate for Erin Molan amid her rumoured feud with Andrew Johns, and Beau Ryan has come to her defence once again.
