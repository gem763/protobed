Photo: Courtesy HBO\n\nAlthough Labor Day is quickly approaching, summer\u2019s unofficial end (or its later official end, for that matter) doesn\u2019t mean an end to worrying about sweat stains. Putting together outfits that can withstand heat and humidity is really more of a year-round challenge for many reasons, including hot offices, traveling, and living in a warm climate, to name a few. And wherever you are, you obviously don\u2019t want to show up drenched in huge, wet blotches \u2014 nor, we suspect, do you want those to emerge halfway through whatever you\u2019re getting dressed for, either.\n\nAccording to the five experts we spoke with \u2014 including stylists and bloggers, one of whom calls herself an excessive sweater \u2014 there\u2019s a two-step approach to dressing for hiding sweat. The first step is finding pieces designed to keep you cool \u2014 to prevent sweating in the first place \u2014 and from there, looking for ways to minimize the appearance of sweat you can\u2019t avoid. As stylist and personal shopper Dina Scherer puts it: \u201cIf it\u2019s hot, you\u2019re still going to sweat, and you\u2019re still going to see the sweat sometimes. But there are a couple of ways to minimize it and be able to feel more comfortable.\u201d When dressing for any hot place where pumping up the air conditioning isn\u2019t an option, Scherer says to generally look for loose, breathable pieces made from natural fabrics like linen, cotton, and even silk. \u201cNatural fibers always breathe more,\u201d she explains. \u201cThey will allow your skin to get rid of the sweat as opposed to condensing it inside and turning it into a puddle.\u201d Below, she and our four other experts share their picks for styles that\u2019ll keep you looking cool \u2014 even when you may be feeling anything but. We\u2019ve conveniently broken them down by type of clothing, to make it even easier to find the exact sweat-hiding garments you need.\n\nBest undergarments for hiding sweat\n\nNumi Signature Seamless Undershirt Although it\u2019s not on display to the world, an undershirt can be a workhorse in helping you stay dry. If you\u2019re wearing a button-down or other top with sleeves, Numi\u2019s undershirt will keep you free of unsightly pit stains, according to Valerie Halfon, stylist and founder of Shop With Val. She says Numi \u201cpatented a technology to help absorb underarm perspiration,\u201d and lines the underarms of its tops with a proprietary sweat-wicking material to keep moisture from showing though. \u201cI\u2019ve been recommending this product to my female clients for years,\u201d she says. Plus, Halfon adds, \u201cthey\u2019re incredibly soft and have a reversible neckline \u2014 crew or scoop,\u201d that makes them easy to pair with any type of shirt. Scherer told us she likes Numi\u2019s undershirts, too, because they\u2019re seamless for extra comfort. $59 at Numi Buy\n\nThompson Tee Sweatproof Undershirt for Women with Underarm Sweat Pads Like the Numi undershirt, this one uses anti-sweat pads under the armpits to absorb sweat before it can seep into your top. Maria Thomas, founder of the blog My Life As a Puddle and a spokeswoman for the International Hyperhidrosis Society, told us she suffers from excessive sweating and relies on Thompson undershirts shirts to stay dry. \u201cI do notice a little bit more thickness underneath my arms,\u201d she says, \u201cbut it\u2019s nothing that\u2019s uncomfortable or would make me not want to wear the shirt.\u201d They\u2019re also cheaper than the Numi tops, making it even easier to stock up. $27 at Amazon Buy $27 at Amazon Buy\n\nKnix Thigh Saver Short We\u2019ve written about how these Knix shorts guard against thigh chafing before, but Scherer told us they\u2019re just as useful for keeping your lower half dry, thanks to their moisture-wicking materials. Thomas agrees that wearing shorts like this can help keep outer layers sweat-free; she told us she\u2019ll often wear similarly fitted men\u2019s boxer briefs under dresses or skirts to catch any sweat that runs down her legs before it seeps into her other clothes. $36 at Knix Buy\n\nUniqlo Women AIRism Bra Sleeveless Top $20 at Uniqlo Buy\n\nUniqlo Women AIRism Ultra Seamless Hiphugger $8 at Uniqlo Buy\n\nFor more minimal undergarments that still help hide sweat, Halfon likes Uniqlo\u2019s AIRism line. She says their underwear styles \u201cuse the type of technology found in activewear,\u201d to wick away moisture and avoid a swampy feeling. And she recommends the AIRism undershirt with a built-in bra as a way to prevent embarrassing under-boob sweat.\n\nBest dresses for hiding sweat\n\nGrana Chinese Silk V-Neck Slip Dress Not surprisingly, several of our experts mentioned breezy, flowy dresses as a great way to prevent (and hide) sweat, since they won\u2019t cling to your body. For a sophisticated take on the summer dress, stylist Sheyna Imm loves this versatile black silk number. She admits that wearing a silk dress in the heat \u201csounds crazy,\u201d but she says that this one is \u201csuperchic and even when you are sweating like crazy, the fabric doesn\u2019t seem to be affected by it.\u201d Grana\u2019s silk is both lightweight and soft, and this loose-fitting style with slits on each side seems especially airy. She likes that it works for both a day at the beach or going out to dinner. And when it\u2019s not as hot out, this can easily be layered with a sweater and tights. $119 at Grana Buy\n\nLacausa Sycamore Dress Imm also likes Los Angeles-based Lacausa, which she says \u201chas the best dresses and loose-fitting cotton-linen blends.\u201d Its bohemian, California vibe lends itself to comfortable and breezy styles, like this flowy maxi-dress that Imm specifically recommended for staying cool and hiding sweat. \u201cIt\u2019s loose, for the most part, to offer comfort,\u201d she explains, \u201cand has a pattern to mask any sweat marks that might sneak in.\u201d Plus, it\u2019s made from 100 percent cotton, so it\u2019ll be more breathable than a synthetic fabric. Imm also told us she likes Lacausa for its high environmental standards and commitment to ethical production. \u201cThey have a great moral compass as a business and a company competing in the world of fast fashion,\u201d she says. $176 at Lacausa Buy\n\nPhoto: Courtesy Athleta Athleta Reversible Santorini High Neck Dress With the lines blurring between workout wear, athleisure, and everyday clothes, it\u2019s possible to find wear-to-work pieces that use the same moisture-wicking, quick-drying fabrics as athletic gear. Halfon says Athleta makes \u201cattractive, non-sporty-looking pieces\u201d in technical fabrics, which are good choices when you want something tighter-fitting that would otherwise stick to your skin and show sweat. This sleeveless dress is one of her favorites. Thanks to its spandex and tencel blend (a combo often seen in performance wear), it has the added bonus of being wrinkle-proof. $128 at Athleta Buy\n\nBest shirts for hiding sweat\n\nEileen Fisher Crewneck Organic Linen Tee $54 (was $108, now 50% off) \u201cLinen is made for the heat,\u201d according to Halfon, who explains \u201cthe natural fiber and light weave allow for maximum breathability.\u201d And because it\u2019s a relaxed fabric, \u201cit doesn\u2019t cling to the body.\u201d She especially likes Eileen Fisher for linen pieces, saying, \u201cthe price point is high, but the quality is great.\u201d This classic short-sleeve top, that can be dressed up or down, is one of her go-to choices for hot days. \u201cThe boxy fit provides ease and ensures the fabric won\u2019t stick to your body,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen the fabric isn\u2019t touching your body there is more room for air to get through, keeping you cool and perspiration to a minimum.\u201d Some very summery linen pieces might not work year-round (since the fabric lends itself to looking relaxed and often intentionally wrinkly), but this simple T-shirt can easily transition to fall and winter. From $54 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nEverlane Linen Relaxed Shirt Jennifer Yedid, a stylist with Harrison Style, says this affordable linen button-down would be \u201cgreat with work pants or jean shorts on the weekend.\u201d She advises picking one up in white or black, since they\u2019re the best colors for masking sweat. $58 at Everlane Buy\n\nRebecca Taylor Malia Floral Top Like Imm, Scherer recommends silk pieces for beating the heat (and not showing sweat), even though they can be more expensive. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason why a silk blouse costs more than a polyester blouse,\u201d she says, \u201cbut this is one of those cases where upgrading your wardrobe to something a little bit better is actually going to pay itself forward.\u201d Rebecca Taylor makes some of her favorite silk tops, including this one, which has cap sleeves for more airflow and a floral pattern that can also be helpful in avoiding sweat stains. \u201cIf you opt for a busier pattern on a shirt, you may not see sweat coming through,\u201d she says. $250 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nFrame True Stripe Linen Tee It\u2019s no secret that we\u2019re big fans of striped tees here at the Strategist, and stylist Bree Jacoby says Frame makes some of the best linen options out there. Along with the highly breathable fabric, she says the darker color and pattern make sweat less visible. $115 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nBest pants for hiding sweat\n\nPhoto: Courtesy Madewell Madewell Chambray Huston Pull-On Crop Pants $55 (was $75, now 27% off) While jeans might be a wardrobe staple, Halfon advises switching to chambray for occasions when you\u2019re worried about showing sweat, as the fabric is cooler and lighter than denim. She explains that, compared to denim, chambray \u201ccomes in a higher thread count, which means it\u2019s a finer weave and more breathable fabric, keeping you cool in dry heat and humidity. I love recommending it to clients because you get the look of denim without the weight and stiffness.\u201d For a polished look that still feels easy, she likes these wide-leg cropped pants that allow for lots of airflow. $55 at Madewell Buy\n\nAthleta Soho Jogger Halfon told us that Athleta also has pants that, like the dress she recommended, are made from fabrics that will help prevent and hide sweat. She likes this linen pair (which is mostly sold out) for looking put-together while staying cool \u2014 but the brand\u2019s Soho Jogger has a very similar silhouette, and is made from a quick-drying fabric blend that promises to wick moisture away from your skin. And even though they\u2019re designed to function like athletic wear, both pairs are a little nicer looking than joggers you\u2019d wear to the gym. $89 at Athleta Buy\n\nVince Women's Culotte Pants While they\u2019re harder to wear year-round, in warmer months Thomas often opts for loose-fitting palazzo-style pants because the roomier cut makes them more breathable and able to hide sweat. Scherer is also a fan of the palazzo-style cut, saying Vince is one of her go-to brands for easy, 100 percent cotton culottes. With wide-cropped legs, they won\u2019t stick to your skin, and the natural fibers will keep you cool. $180 at Amazon Buy $180 at Amazon Buy\n\nEcupper Womens Casual Loose Elastic Waist Cotton Trouser Here\u2019s a significantly cheaper pair of culottes that offer the same sweat-beating cut, are also all-cotton \u2014 and boast more than 400 five-star reviews on Amazon. $25 at Amazon Buy $25 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest blazers for hiding sweat\n\nTheory Good Linen Clean Blazer $237 (was $395, now 40% off) If you have to wear a blazer to work year-round, choose a summer style that won\u2019t leave you sweltering. This Theory number is one of Scherer\u2019s favorites because \u201clinen is super breathable and this [blazer] has stretch,\u201d so you can move around comfortably. $237 at Theory Buy\n\nEverlane Cotton-Linen Blazer Everlane\u2019s more affordable cotton and linen blazer adheres to the basic guidelines Scherer says to look for when shopping for one that won\u2019t show sweat. It isn\u2019t stretchy, like the Theory option, but with an oversized fit it\u2019ll feel breezy and not restrictive. $145 at Everlane Buy\n\nAritzia Babaton Leonard Blazer Although it sounds counterintuitive, both Scherer and Jacoby actually say that a lightweight wool blazer can also be a good choice for preventing sweat and its unsightly stains. \u201cLightweight wool looks polished and breathes,\u201d says Scherer. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot more comfortable than a polyester or rayon.\u201d Jacoby told us she turns to Aritzia for basics like blazers \u2014 and for hiding moisture, she recommends wearing light colors, like this blush pink, instead of white clothes (which can be permanently stained by sweat). $228 at Aritzia Buy\n\nBest insoles for absorbing sweat\n\nSummer Soles Softness of Suede Stay-Dry Women's Full Length Insoles People may generally not worry as much about showing sweat in their shoes, but anyone who has skipped socks when it\u2019s warm knows foot sweating can be a big problem \u2014 especially when it leads to sliding around in a pair of flats or sandals. To keep her shoes dry, Thomas lines them with these peel-and-stick insoles. \u201cMy feet still sweat but the Summer Soles absorb the sweat and prevent that \u2018slip-and-slide\u2019 feeling,\u201d she says. They\u2019re durable enough to last a whole season, and inexpensive enough to replace when it\u2019s cold enough for tights or real socks again. $20 at Amazon Buy $20 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
