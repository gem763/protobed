Disney said earlier this year that it wouldn\u2019t run promotions from rival streaming platforms, but was able to reach compromises with almost all of them. Sources said Disney\u2019s decision stemmed from whether its relationships with its rivals were mutually beneficial\u2014and Netflix doesn\u2019t run advertisements on its own programming. (Wall Street Journal)\n\nTalking point: The entertainment conglomerate\u2019s foray into streaming through Disney Plus has caused issues with several tech giants. Disney is currently in conflict with Amazon, which wants to sell a large volume of ads on Disney apps carried on Amazon\u2019s Fire TV. Disney doesn\u2019t like the terms, and if the two can\u2019t come to an agreement, Amazon could remove Disney\u2019s apps\u2014including those for ABC and ESPN\u2014from its digital media player, which is the second-biggest TV app distributor. In September, Disney CEO Robert Iger resigned from Apple\u2019s board the day the iPhone maker announced it would launch its own streaming service with a price that undercut Disney Plus.", "description": "", "authors": ["Hanna Lee"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
