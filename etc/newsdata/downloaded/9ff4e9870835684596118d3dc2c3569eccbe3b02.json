It was the Indians\u2019 17th consecutive win against Detroit this season.\n\nCleveland matched Tampa Bay at 90-63 with the Rays idle. Both teams trail Oakland by two games for the top spot. The Indians remained four games behind Minnesota in the AL Central.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not enough,\u201d Cleveland manager Terry Francona said. \u201cWe need more. I don\u2019t know how many more, but I\u2019m guessing we\u2019ll need several more.\u201d\n\nThe Indians matched a franchise record for consecutive wins against a team in a season - they also won 17 straight over Baltimore in 1954. Cleveland won 18 of 19 versus Detroit in the season series and outscored the Tigers 116-38.\n\n\u201cThey have definitely had our number,\u201d Tigers manager Ron Gardenhire said. \u201cThat\u2019s an understatement. It\u2019s not easy getting knocked around a little bit.\u201d\n\nClevinger needed 33 pitches to get through a messy first inning. Harold Castro and Miguel Cabrera singled with one out and Jeimer Candelario drew a two-out walk, but Jordy Mercer flied out on a 3-2 pitch.\n\nThe right-hander allowed seven hits and struck out six. He is 11-1 with a 1.89 ERA over his last 15 starts.\n\n\u201cWe won a game, but we\u2019ve got to win every game right now,\u201d Clevinger said. \u201cSo, that\u2019s the way we\u2019re looking at it going into each day.\u201d\n\nReyes, who missed two games for personal reasons, hit a two-run homer in the fourth off Drew VerHagen. Reyes has 35 homers this season, including eight for the Indians since being acquired from San Diego at the trade deadline.\n\nYasiel Puig was 9 for 14 in the series and had an RBI double in the fourth. Roberto P\u00e9rez drove in two runs with a single in the fifth, and Carlos Santana and Oscar Mercado each had an RBI.\n\nStarter Daniel Norris (3-13) allowed one run in three innings for the Tigers, who have the worst record in baseball at 45-107. Detroit set a record for its longest losing streak against an opponent. The Tigers dropped 16 in a row to Minnesota from 2002-03.\n\nThe shutout was the 15th by Cleveland this season, and Detroit was blanked for the 14th time.\n\nGETTING HIS SWINGS\n\nIndians third baseman Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez took batting practice Thursday for the first time since breaking his right hand last month. He had surgery Aug. 26. He\u2019s pushing to return before the regular season finale Sept. 29.\n\nLATE NIGHT VIEWING\n\nFrancona is keeping track of the other playoff contenders, but not in the most direct way.\n\nHe said he\u2019s binge-watching the television show Madam Secretary at home after games. Francona was also watching Wednesday night\u2019s game between Tampa Bay and the Los Angeles Dodgers on his phone. The Rays tied it in the ninth against closer Kenley Jansen and won in 11 innings.\n\n\u201cI fell asleep and it was the ninth inning and Tampa had nobody on with one out,\u201d Francona said. \u201cI woke up and I checked my phone and I was like, \u2018You gotta be kidding me.\u2019 So, yeah, that was a long convoluted way of saying that I pay attention.\u201d\n\nLOOK IT UP\n\nDetroit\u2019s only win against Cleveland came at Comerica Park on April 8 in a 4-1 victory. Matthew Boyd was the winning pitcher, and Niko Goodrum and John Hicks homered off since-traded Trevor Bauer, who got the loss.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nTigers: Candelario started for the first time since Monday after being out with bruised right triceps.\n\nIndians: LHP Brad Hand played catch Thursday and will be evaluated by the training staff to determine the next step as he deals with a tired arm. He hasn\u2019t pitched in a game since Sept. 8.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nTigers: RHP Jordan Zimmermann (1-11, 6.32 ERA) will start the opener of a three-game series against the Chicago White Sox on Friday night at Comerica Park. RHP Dylan Cease (3-7, 6.18 ERA) will start for Chicago.\n\nIndians: RHP Shane Bieber (14-7, 3.26 ERA) will pitch in the opener of a three-game series against Philadelphia on Friday night. LHP Drew Smyly (4-6, 6.22 ERA) will start for the Phillies, who are in contention for an NL wild card spot.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Indians have work to do on their postseason push, and no games left against their favorite pushovers.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Herrick"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/19/tigers_indians_baseball_62487_c0-885-2424-2298_s1770x1032.jpg?75ec945903a3045b167d02e1e5aebf8491b4086c", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
