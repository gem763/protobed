They\u2019re simple, wearable, recognizable sneakers that populate our offices and Brooklyn-bound subway cars. Even Meghan Markle has them! They\u2019re lifestyle shoes, and while I have worn them hiking, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily recommend it. And because Veja prides itself on being on the forefront of ethics and sustainability, they couldn\u2019t branch out into running shoes without finding a sustainable way to do it. After four years of development, the brand has introduced the Condor, made with 53 percent bio-based and recycled material.\n\nFifty-three percent after four years of development may not seem like a lot, but it\u2019s hard to make a running shoe that doesn\u2019t include plastic \u2014 who wants to run in leather? And technical shoes include a lot of different kinds of plastic. There\u2019s the insole, the sole, the mesh, the plastic thing at the end of the shoelaces \u2026 you get the picture.\n\nIdeally, Veja wants to move beyond petroleum-based products for its shoes. The list of materials in the Condor includes recycled plastic (made from water bottles, of course), ricinus oil, banana oil, sugar cane, rice husk, and wild rubber from the Amazon. They\u2019re made in Brazilian factories, and Veja discusses the conditions in those factories on its site.\n\nOther brands have been on a quest to find the most sustainable athletic shoe, but the Condor (which is recommended for running up to a half-marathon) uses the least petroleum of any other running shoe currently on the market. In April, Everlane and Adidas both unveiled their takes on sustainable shoes with different approaches. Everlane\u2019s TREAD is made primarily of leather and recycled plastic. Adidas\u2019s Futurecraft Loop is a 100 percent recyclable shoe, yet to be released. All that research and development on Veja\u2019s side didn\u2019t drive up the price, either \u2014 the Condor is available now in six colors for $150.\n\nShop the Story\n\nVeja Condor Mesh Yellow Fluo White $150 at Veja Buy\n\nIf you buy something through our links, New York may earn an affiliate commission.", "description": "Cult-favorite sneaker brand Veja has created a new sustainable, eco-friendly running shoe, called the Condor.", "authors": ["Sarah Spellings"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/19/veja/AW19_Lookbook_Running_Vincent_19_WEB.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
