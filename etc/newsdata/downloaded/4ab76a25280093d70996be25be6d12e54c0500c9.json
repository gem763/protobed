The impact sparked wildfires that stretched for hundreds of miles, triggered a mile-high tsunami, and released billions of tons of sulfur into the atmosphere.\n\nWithin a minute of hitting the Earth, the Chicxulub asteroid had bored a hole nearly 100 miles wide into the sea floor, creating a bubbling pit of molten rock and super-hot gas. The contents of that fiery cauldron skyrocketed, creating a mountain-high plume that poured acid rain into the oceans.\n\nRead More: For the first time, a timeline reveals what happened in the minutes and hours after the asteroid crash that killed the dinosaurs\n\nWhile scientists knew catastrophic events on land following the asteroid's impact triggered the mass extinction of 75% of life on Earth (including the dinosaurs), the mechanism by which ocean species perished was less certain. Now, a study in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that the barrage of acid rain following impact was probably the killer.\n\nAfter the asteroid crash, the study authors wrote, the oceans underwent rapid and intense acidification. That then disrupted marine food webs and sparked a mass extinction.\n\n\"It's flash acidification, and it transformed ecosystems for millions of years,\" Noah Planavsky, one of the study's authors, told the New York Times.\n\nChicxulub_impact asteroid More\n\nDonald Davis/NASA\n\nTiny fossil shells reveal what happened after impact\n\nTo unravel the mystery of what happened following the fateful asteroid crash, scientists either examine rocks that were deposited during or after the impact, or seek out fossils of creatures that died around the time Chicxulub hit.\n\nIn this case, the lead author of the study, Michael Henehan, found a revealing layers of clay in the Geulhemmerberg cave in the Netherlands. The clay contained rocks dating back to both the time right before the impact, as well as the moments after the crash. The rocks in each layer held fossilized shells of microscopic plankton called foraminifera.\n\nHenehan and his team were able to examine levels of chemical isotopes in those shells, which offered clues about the plankton died.\n\ntiny shells More\n\nMichael J. Henehan\n\nHenehan's team found that the proportion of boron isotopes \u2014 a measurement that can serve as a proxy for ocean acidity \u2014 suggested there was an increase in the acidification of the seas over the 100 to 1,000 years following the Chicxulub asteroid impact. He told The Guardian that the walls of the fossilized shells also appeared \"much thinner and poorly calcified after the impact.\"", "description": "A new study found that the asteroid impact that led the dinosaurs to go extinct also caused rapid ocean acidification, which killed most sea life.", "authors": ["Aylin Woodward"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/As5Mfb2JFmfs.mkX24sZkQ--~B/aD03MTQ7dz05NTI7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/999749bceaf5ed10b12285d48590c8e0", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
