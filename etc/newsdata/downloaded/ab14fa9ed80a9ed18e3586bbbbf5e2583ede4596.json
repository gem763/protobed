Donald Trump\u2019s very utterances against disruptive protestors at rallies (instead of curling into the sweaty embrace of Michelle Obama a la George W. Bush) are signs of imminent death camps. It provides justification to the black-masked terrorists who gang up and physically attack anticommunists.\n\nIt\u2019s about as accurate as Howard Zinn\u2019s A People\u2019s History of the United States.\n\nFor Bray, world history consists of the clash of two forces of good and evil, communism and fascism/capitalism, respectively.\n\nFor Howard Zinn, American history consists of the clash of two forces of good and evil, communism and capitalism, respectively. And America is fascist.\n\nJust as Howard Zinn, an immensely popular professor at Boston University (1964 to retirement in 1988) because he handed out A\u2019s like candy and asked that students only participate in classroom \u201crap\u201d sessions, follow him on protests, journal, and interview prison inmates (all considered \u201cpolitical prisoners\u201d), Mark Bray combines \u201cscholarship\u201d with activism. Half of the profits from his book are going to Antifa.\n\nAs Katie Pavlich pointed out, Boston University is the alma mater of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who majored in international studies and economics\u2014or international socialism. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s attendance intersected for one year with one of the interviewees for my book, Debunking Howard Zinn: Exposing the Fake History That Turned a Generation against America. Unlike Ocasio-Cortez, my interviewee has gone on to do something useful, i.e., start her own company and a family. She described her horrific experience, after having been subjected in high school not only to Zinn\u2019s book, but a lecture by the old lecher himself. She told me Zinn was still worshiped on the campus of BU.\n\nZinn made visits back to campus, including in 2009, the year before he died. He appeared with Ellen Goodman and Mary Gordon at the \u201cHoward Zinn Lecture Series,\u201d endowed by one of Zinn\u2019s former students, Alex MacDonald, and his wife. Another student, William Holtzman, used part of his fortune to cofound the Zinn Education Project that spreads Zinn\u2019s propaganda in workshops and downloadable lessons for teachers.\n\nBU president Robert A. Brown, upon Zinn\u2019s death, described him as an \u201c\u2019iconic writer and educator who impacted generations of students at Boston university.\u201d You can say that again! \u201c'Hopefully'\u201d [sic] said Brown, \u201c'his spirit will live on at the University through the Howard Zinn lecture series in the College of Arts & Sciences. . . .'\u201d\n\nOther past speakers have included Zinn\u2019s admirer Eric Foner (who has inherited his sympathy for communism from Party members of his family) and Bob Herbert (Fidel Castro champion for the New York Times).\n\nSo it is not surprising that Boston University would put every obstacle in the way to prevent Ben Shapiro from speaking, including exorbitant security fees and forcing the talk into a too small venue. A YAF spokesman rightfully complained about the demands for ensuring security\u2014not for Shapiro, but for the protestors who would mob him\u2014by \u201cthe powers that be at Boston University.\u201d The \u201cpowers that be\u201d\u2014surprise\u2014include the same president who spoke glowingly of Zinn in 2010.\n\nRobert A. Brown provides a marked contrast to John Silber who began his presidency of BU in 1971, and who insisted on high academic standards and did everything he could to try to get rid of Zinn. (There is no John Silber lecture series at BU.) Contrary to accepted wisdom, Zinn did not write \u201ca bottom-up\u201d history of the \u201cpeople\u201d who weren\u2019t the \u201cwinners.\u201d His people are well-known revolutionary leaders and anonymous mouthpieces spouting Marxist slogans. Indeed, half of Zinn\u2019s chapter on the Vietnam War is about the protest movements Zinn led at BU and elsewhere. The other half is pro-North Vietnam propaganda with Ho Chi Minh presented as the one truly embodying the principles of the Declaration of Independence. The takeaway is that Amerikkka can never be reformed in its republican, capitalist form. Hope glimmers only when blood is flowing from rioting and the deaths of martyrs like John Brown and members of the Black Panthers.\n\nIndeed, the writings of Zinn provided revolutionary inspiration to Occupy Wall Street protestors and their \u201cCop Watch\u201d punks, which morphed into Black-Lives-Matter, which made common cause with Antifa, a movement imported from Europe, where apparently getting kicked out of an apartment where one is \u201csquatting\u201d is taken as a sign of fascism. One American Antifa martyr left instructions in his manifesto to read Zinn\u2019s tome.\n\nThere was little fanfare when Bucknell University\u2019s Humanities Center invited Bray to give the kickoff talk (on the eve of the 9/11 anniversary) in the \u201cConfronting Fascism\u201d series, revealed by three brave professors in their letter to the student newspaper as \u201ctied to political resistance to the Trump administration.\u201d Even Nancy Pelosi had condemned Antifa\u2019s violence, they noted. The Humanities Center does not list past or future speakers. Why not? Nor was Bray\u2019s appearance advertised or even covered by a student reporter.\n\nBucknell is in central Pennsylvania, \u201ca fairly red [Republican] part of the country.\u201d Unlike YAF events which are open to the public, this event seems to have been limited to supportive faculty and students and is being kept under wraps. Why? And why does Boston University want to stop someone who wants the whole world to hear his message?", "description": "These are Orwellian times when a pro-American speaker who advocates .09/23/2019 13:14:41PM EST.", "authors": ["Mary Grabar", "Katie Pavlich", "Cortney O'Brien", "Guy Benson"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2010/27/0dbf456f-e2e8-4985-a162-b952f7119cd2@news.ap.org.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
