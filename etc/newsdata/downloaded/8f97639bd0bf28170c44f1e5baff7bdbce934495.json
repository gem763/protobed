The whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? Am I allowed to mention 'God' to you?\"\n\nAcosta \u2013 who has emerged as a household name for interruptions when Trump and members of his administration are made available to the press \u2013 responded by telling Conway that he doesn\u2019t have an \u201calternative facts\u201d problem like she does.\n\n\"Make sure that goes viral. This is why I\u2019m one of the only people around here who gives you the time of day,\" Conway said. \"You\u2019re such a smarta-- most of the time and I know you want this to go viral.\"\n\nConway then told Acosta that \u201ca lot of these people\u201d don\u2019t like him, while pointing to his peers.\n\n\u201cDon't you put it back in my face for all corrections your network needs to issue,\u201d she continued, mocking CNN. \u201cI was on your network 25 or 26 times in 2018. I\u2019m one of the last people here who even bothered to go on, and the disrespect you show to me personally, I\u2019ll look past it.\u201d\n\nCNN STAR DON LEMON SAYS TRUMP ADDRESS SHOULD BE AIRED ON A DELAY\n\nAcosta replied, \u201cMa\u2019am.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon't call me ma'am,\u201d Conway responded.\n\nLast year Acosta was briefly banned from the White House after he engaged in a contentious back-and-forth with Trump during a Nov. 7 press conference. During the now-infamous moment, Acosta refused to pass the microphone to a female White House aide.\n\nAcosta\u2019s press pass was restored on Nov. 19 after CNN argued that keeping him out of the White House violated the network and Acosta\u2019s First and Fifth Amendment rights.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTo coincide with Acosta being allowed to return to the White House, Press Secretary Sarah Sanders implemented a series of rules to govern White House press conferences going forward.\n\nThe CNN reporter has been praised by liberal comedians such as Jimmy Kimmel, and even appeared in the most recent season of the Netflix political drama \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d", "description": "Kellyanne Conway embarrassed CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta during a press gaggle on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Brian Flood", "Brian Flood Covers The Media For Fox News.
