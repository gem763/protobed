Obviously with a conference that is where you give the leadership of the party the time\u2026 it is the mandate of the party to refresh the policies of the party,\" Malatsi added.\n\nWith some expecting a heated battle as talks continue over the soul of the party, Malatsi said the mood inside was \"tranquil, civil and robust\".\n\n#DAFedCo spokesperson refusing to confirm that the party CEO stepped down following recommendations from the review panel report that he and Maimane should step down @TeamNews24 \u2014 Matshidiso Madia (@tshidi_lee) October 19, 2019\n\n#DAFedCo Maimane also suggested the DA must consider having a policy conference @TeamNews24 \u2014 Matshidiso Madia (@tshidi_lee) October 19, 2019\n\n#DAFedCo Malatsi says the panel led by Tony Leon, Michiel Le Roux & Ryan Coetzee has just finished delivering its report @TeamNews24 \u2014 Matshidiso Madia (@tshidi_lee) October 19, 2019\n\n#DAFedCo Maimane addressed the council, paid tribute to James Selfe.
