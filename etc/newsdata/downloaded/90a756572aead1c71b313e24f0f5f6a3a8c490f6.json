His attackers left a written death threat over his lifeless body, referencing his father\u2019s murder, who was killed shortly after his birth in 1992.\n\nHe narrowly survived and was forced into hiding, unable to seek medical attention. Rolando said he had to remove the bullet from his head instead.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t have anyone left,\u2019 Rolando told the Guardian, saying coming to the US was his only option. \u2018Giving me an opportunity to be here is giving me an opportunity to stay alive.\u2019\n\nRolando escaped to Mexico last year and joined a migrant caravan, eventually arriving in Tijuana, where he became stranded because of the the Trump administration\u2019s metering policy, which limits how many people can ask for asylum at U.S. ports of entry each day.\n\nThe waiting-list has more than 10,000 people on it, with only a few dozen allowed to cross daily. Wait times are expected to take between six and nine months.\n\nRolando was eventually moved onto San Diego, where he escaped ICE\u2019s Otay Mesa detention center alive and now awaits an asylum hearing.\n\nHowever, he isn\u2019t alone in his claims of medical neglect.\n\nIn February, more than 70 detainees signed on to a letter speaking out against sordid conditions at the facility, in which they alleged they had experienced racism, discrimination, and medical neglect.\n\nIn 2018, a coalition of immigration advocacy groups released a report finding that substandard medical care contributed to the deaths of eight immigrants in ICE custody between December 2015 and April 2017, including one at Otay Mesa.", "description": "Identified only as Ronaldo, 27, the asylum-seeker fled to the US as part of a migrant caravan earlier this year, hoping to flee torture and persecution in his home country, two years after he was shot.", "authors": ["Luke Kenton For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/20/19550826-0-image-a-86_1570736894177.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
