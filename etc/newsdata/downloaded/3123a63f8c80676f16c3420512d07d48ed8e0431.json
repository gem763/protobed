He\u2019s not apologizing.", "language": "en", "text": "A South Carolina sheriff candidate is fessing up to something that has tarnished many politicians: sporting blackface.\n\nCraig Stivender, 36, released a campaign ad Tuesday in which he outlines the importance of transparency.\n\n\u201cI want to tell you some things that politicians would try to hide, things that my opponents may try to use to tarnish my integrity,\u201d the Republican candidate said in an television ad that began with aerial shots of the Palmetto State\u2019s waters and woods and with slow-motion shots of Stivender shooting a gun and hugging people.\n\nThe South Carolina native whose family has been in Colleton County for more than 200 years provided more detail about what he meant by that statement.\n\nSitting in a rocking chair and looking directly in the camera, Stivender revealed that he received a ticket as a 16-year-old for not having a driver\u2019s license and that he is married for the second time. He also said he\u2019s lost his temper at work as a police officer and that he was reprimanded for his actions. He even admits to being responsible for some fender benders.\n\nBut the most shocking disclosure was his admission that he wore blackface 10 years ago at a law enforcement Halloween party. The video included an image of Stivender with darkened skin in a turquoise shirt, with studs in his ear and a gold chain around his neck. He was standing next to a black woman.\n\nStivender said he dressed as Demetrius Edward \u201cBig Meech\u201d Flenory, one of the leaders of the Detroit-based Black Mafia Family who was sentenced to 30 years in prison for drug trafficking and money laundering.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m a police officer, the exact opposite would be a gang member,\u201d Stivender said. \u201cSo that\u2019s what I picked.\u201d\n\nPoliticians on the left and right of the political spectrum have had to make public apologies for past acts of blackface, a historically racist form of theater in which a nonblack person paints themselves dark as a means to ridicule and mock black people.\n\nEarlier in the year, Democratic Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam\u2019s old medical school yearbook surfaced, showing on Northam\u2019s yearbook page a person in blackface next to another person dressed as a Ku Klux Klan member. He initially took blame and then later said he wasn\u2019t in the photo. Northam, who was elected with great help from black voter turnout, met with black leaders and vowed to complete the rest of his term focused on racial equity.\n\nIn August, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey, a Republican, apologized to her state for a blackface skit she participated in 52 years ago. She has since faced calls for her resignation but has stayed in office.\n\nAcross the northern border, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized for multiple images that surfaced last month of him in blackface and brownface. He has admitted that he didn\u2019t know any better at the time the incidents occurred and has moved his talking points to other issues as he faces a reelection campaign.\n\nStivender said he understands the disappointment of those \u201cwho may be upset\u201d but argued that honesty was most important to his nascent campaign.\n\n\u201cThat was a different time,\u201d he said. \u201cToday we understand that type of costume is troubling to many.\u201d\n\nHe told ABC News 4 \u2014 based in Mount Pleasant, S.C. \u2014 that he didn\u2019t know what blackface was 10 years ago and that it wasn\u2019t his intention to offend anyone. He didn\u2019t apologize for his action when reporter Kate Mosso asked if he would.\n\nStivender\u2019s campaign said in an email that it stands behind previous statements and that the campaign has received mostly positive attention from the local community.\n\nThat attention, according to conservative and liberal political strategists, could be a toss-up with voters.\n\nMatt Moore, the state\u2019s former GOP chairman and a partner at political consulting firm First Tuesday Strategies in Columbia, S.C., called Stivender\u2019s ad a \u201ctrain wreck\u201d and said Stivender\u2019s claim that he didn\u2019t mean to offend and didn\u2019t know about blackface 10 years ago is a \u201cjoke.\u201d\n\nMoore noted that had an opponent uncovered Stivender\u2019s past, it probably would have been a one-day story, instead of being the central issue of his campaign.\n\nMoore said the low-country region of South Carolina has a distorted history surrounding race, and Colleton County needs a sheriff who can build bridges and move the community forward.\n\nBut it\u2019s important to understand the context of Colleton County before completely judging the sheriff\u2019s ignorance, said longtime political consultant Wesley Donehue of South Carolina-based Push Digital. His firm counts Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and the National Republican Senatorial Committee among its clients.\n\nDonehue spent part of his childhood in the county. He has never met Stivender, but he did say the sheriff hopeful\u2019s description about the past decade is correct, pointing to the fun that was made of interracial couples in the area and his own grandfather being buried in a Confederate uniform not long ago.\n\n\u201cColleton is really stuck a decade or two behind everybody else,\u201d he said about the county of nearly 38,000. \u201cThe beauty of the Internet is it breaks down the barrier and people in those areas are starting to wise up.\u201d\n\nStill, Donehue believes the county\u2019s black population is owed a personal apology.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s running for a top law enforcement position. He has a moral obligation, especially to the minority community, to explain why he did this,\u201d Donehue said, pointing to strained relations between law enforcement and communities of color.\n\nThe county, which once was home to many cotton plantations, is about 60 percent white and 37 percent black, according to census data. Its Latino population is a little over 3 percent. Most of Colleton County voters cast their ballots for President Trump in 2016; he took nearly 53 percent of its votes.\n\nThree Democrats, one of whom is black, and another Republican are also running for Colleton County sheriff.\n\nMoore said the best action for Stivender to take would be to drop out because the state doesn\u2019t need anymore embarrassing sheriffs.\n\nAt least 11 of South Carolina\u2019s sheriffs in its 46 counties have been accused of breaking laws, according to the Post and Courier.\n\n\u201cIf he really didn\u2019t know [about blackface], do voters really want someone who is incapable of Googling to find out,\u201d Moore asked.\n\nRead more:\n\nAlabama\u2019s Republican governor apologizes for wearing blackface in college, refuses to resign\n\nA Belgian festival has long featured a \u2018savage\u2019 in blackface.

That\u2019s changed.", "description": "Colleton County sheriff hopeful Craig Stivender has an interesting campaign strategy: admit to sporting blackface before anyone else outs him.
