My second child\u2019s baby daddy dumped me for four months ago when she was five months old. I found out he\u2019d cheated on me and then he decided to pick this new girl over me. He does send money for the baby, but he never asks about her. He puts all these pictures on Facebook of him and his new girlfriend, which makes me feel really bad. I told him I wanted to work things out, but he told me I must go back to my first baby daddy. How do I walk away from him?\n\nAnswer\n\nYou are definitely worth more than the way he is treating you. He has found a new love and is flashing it in your face because he knows you have feelings for him. You should never have asked him to work things out be-because he\u2019d already showed you that he didn\u2019t care about you anymore when he left you and your baby, who was only five months old. It\u2019s good that he\u2019s assisting you financially \u2013 at least he\u2019s doing his duty. If he doesn\u2019t want to become emotionally involved with the child, that\u2019s his choice. What you need to do is concentrate on raising your children. Be there for them because they need you in their lives. Forget about him and work on yourself as a person so you can become the kind of mother your children will be proud of. He showed you that he can\u2019t be trusted when he decided to cheat on you and then he chose the other woman over you. This does not mean the end of your life \u2013 it is in fact a new beginning. Be kind to yourself.\n\nAccording to WikiHow you may always have good feelings toward your ex. Breaking up doesn't mean you hate someone. Generally, your feelings of love will start to fade over time, though, and you'll meet new people and move on. In some cases, however, you may not be able to let go of those feelings. If you can't let go of your ex, you can learn how to let him know.", "description": "Sis Dolly answers some of the burning questions from our readers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9521/3b5d1f9e9c674fa4b9a3e5e6c69ab7a0.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
