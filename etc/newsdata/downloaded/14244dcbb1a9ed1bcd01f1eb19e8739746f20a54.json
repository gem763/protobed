The person declined to discuss specifics in an interview with the Post.\n\nThe scant details come even as the other whistleblower \u2014 the one describing Trump\u2019s bid to force Ukraine to investigate his rival Joe Biden \u2014 has precipitated the impeachment inquiry now consuming the capital.\n\nA big difference between the cases is that the IRS one is hampered by strict taxpayer secrecy laws. It is a felony to disclose private taxpayer information, including details of the president\u2019s returns, which makes it difficult for lawmakers and the whistleblower alike to go public with the specifics of the allegations.\n\nThere are ways around those restrictions, and some predict more information will eventually come out, though some experts say it\u2019s also possible the public will never learn anything more about what the IRS whistleblower is alleging.\n\nFor now, the case has many scratching their heads.\n\nHouse Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal is demanding six years' worth of Trump\u2019s tax records. | Alex Brandon/AP Photo\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit hard to pin down, and know what exactly is being claimed,\u201d said Dean Zerbe, a longtime expert on whistleblowers who represents them at the firm Zerbe, Miller, Fingeret, Frank & Jadav.\n\nHouse Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.), who is demanding six years' worth of Trump\u2019s tax records, says he needs them to determine how well the IRS is implementing its long-standing policy of automatically auditing the president. Those examinations, which are conducted in secret by career IRS officials, are supposed to be free from political influence. Democrats are using the whistleblower\u2019s complaint to buttress their lawsuit, now in federal court in Washington.\n\nThe Post described the whistleblower as a career IRS official who said he had been told by someone else of the allegation. The report did not say by whom, and the whistleblower wouldn\u2019t go into any details of his allegations.\n\n\u201cI steadfastly refuse to discuss the substance or detail of the complaint, but I have some legitimate concerns about reckless statements being made about whistleblowers,\u201d the person said.\n\nIt\u2019s a felony punishable by up to five years in prison to improperly release private tax information, and that doesn\u2019t just include what\u2019s in someone\u2019s return. So-called return information is also protected, such as the details of the mechanics of any audits.\n\nThe rules, laid out in Section 6103 of the tax code, allow whistleblowers to take their complaints to lawmakers, who can investigate them privately, but it\u2019s hard for either to speak publicly.\n\n\u201cThe contents of the complaint are protected by 6103 so the committee can\u2019t discuss it,\u201d said Dan Rubin, a Neal spokesperson.\n\nAll of that makes it tough to assess the credibility of the whistleblower, let alone the specifics of his complaint or how he claims to know the information. Under a 1998 law, it would be a felony for the White House to try to influence an IRS audit. It\u2019s conceivable there are less nefarious explanations as well, some note.\n\n\u201cMy guess, without knowing the facts, is that it was some idiot at Treasury who called over there without knowing he shouldn\u2019t be doing that,\u201d speculated one Washington tax veteran.\n\nZerbe, who previously worked on the Senate Finance Committee, says whistleblowers approach the tax committees from time to time, though their allegations of wrongdoing aren\u2019t always borne out.\n\n\u201cWe would get these kinds of allegations on the committee more than you\u2019d think \u2014 not dealing with the president but, \u2018Oh, they\u2019re targeting this group or they\u2019re going after that group,'\u201d he said. \u201cPeople of good faith would bring them forward, and we would look at them in good faith. But often, when you looked at it, you understood why the government took the actions they did, and no, it wasn\u2019t because they didn\u2019t like this organization.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS Morning Tax Sign up for our tax policy newsletter and stay informed \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Earlier this month, Neal told Massachusetts reporters that House lawyers are \u201ctrying to interview the individual.\u201d Bloomberg News reported Neal is considering releasing the whistleblower\u2019s complaint, though a Neal spokesperson emphasized the chairman said that\u2019s \u201csubject to what counsel advises.\u201d\n\nThere are some ways details of the complaint could be released. A judge could order them released as part of Neal\u2019s lawsuit. The Ways and Means Committee could vote in private to make the information public, as the panel has previously done in rare instances. The specifics could also be leaked anonymously to the news media, despite the secrecy laws.\n\nAmong those wondering about the whistleblower: Trump\u2019s lawyers. In a court filing late last month, they complained they still don\u2019t know much about the allegations.\n\n\u201cThe committee does not explain how these allegations are in any way related to its demands to see six years of tax returns and return information, let alone why only the tax returns and return information can satisfy its supposed legislative interest such that further negotiations are not even worthwhile,\u201d they said.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/0e/81/8e6233794a0e9f3c6bcfe0ee2a3b/20191009-donald-trump-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
