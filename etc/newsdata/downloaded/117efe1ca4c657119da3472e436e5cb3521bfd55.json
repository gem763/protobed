And those are just some of the home improvement projects the first lady has overseen to keep the well-trod public rooms at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. looking their museum-quality best.\n\nSome of the projects were long overdue.\n\nSunlight streaming into the Red Room had left some of the wall fabric \"so faded it was almost pink,\" said Stewart McLaurin, president of the White House Historical Association, which helps finance upkeep of some rooms in the 132-room mansion. First lady Jacqueline Kennedy founded the private, nonprofit organization in 1961.\n\n\"Those rooms should always look their very best and it was just very faded and really, really needed to be done,\" McLaurin said.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and his wife, Jenny, and guests for Friday's three-course state dinner in their honor should have an opportunity to check out the spiffed-up public rooms.\n\nIn her role as caretaker, the first lady \u2014 whoever she is \u2014 meets regularly with the chief usher, the head curator and other White House staff to figure out what improvements should top the to-do list.\n\nMrs. Trump, who keeps a relatively low profile as first lady, has put her interest in history to use overseeing the restoration projects.\n\n\"Our family is grateful to live in this true symbol of our nation's history, but we are even more honored to play a part in restoring and enhancing our country's sacred landmark,\" she said at a May reception.\n\nThe first lady designed a new rug for the Diplomatic Reception Room, the main entrance off the South Lawn, after foot traffic wore a path across the old one, McLaurin said. The replacement has a border showing the flowers of the 50 states, a touch added by the first lady.\n\nThe White House also refreshed draperies in the Green Room by switching material from the backside to the front, eliminating the need \u2014 and cost \u2014 of replacing the curtains entirely, McLaurin said. Only the fringe had to be replaced.\n\nLast year, Mrs. Trump returned to the Blue Room several restored pieces from a historic 53-piece furniture set known as the Bellang\u00e9 suite.\n\nDecor upgrades are a bit more complicated at the White House than for typical homeowners.\n\nRenovation ideas are shared with the Kennedy-created Committee for the Preservation of the White House, which provides advice on preserving the public rooms on the Ground and State floors.\n\nThe committee requests funding from the historical association, whose board typically authorizes spending $1 million to $1.5 million on such projects each year.\n\nThe White House serves several purposes: It's an office for the president and his staff, a home for his family and a living museum. Approximately half a million tourists visit every year, apart from dignitaries and others who attend receptions and other events.\n\n\"The White House does get a lot of wear and tear,\" McLaurin said.\n\nThe Bellange suite furnishings were brought to the White House in 1817 by President James Monroe, formerly the U.S. ambassador to France.\n\nBut in 1860, nearly all the pieces were sold at an auction.\n\nOne hundred years later, Jacqueline Kennedy arrived and was appalled to discover the White House was furnished with reproductions from a New York department store, McLaurin said. She created the historical association, the advisory committee and a curator to help the White House collect and exhibit only the best, McLaurin said.\n\nThe White House has managed to reacquire 10 pieces from the original suite, made in Paris by Pierre-Antoine Bellang\u00e9. The rest of the collection is \"lost to history,\" McLaurin said.\n\nThe Bellang\u00e9 restoration project began during Michelle Obama's time as first lady and was completed last year, costing the historical association more than $450,000 since 2013.\n\nThe wood, brass and lighting inside an elevator that takes the president to and from the private living quarters has also been refinished.\n\nNext up? New upholstery on chairs and benches in the high-traffic Diplomatic Reception Room.", "description": "Like anyone who has ever spruced up their home, Melania Trump will have a few new touches to showcase Friday when guests visit the White House for only the second state dinner of the Trump presidency.
