A rival plan proposed by the pro-European Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party (SNP) proposes December 9.\n\nThe second option is also preferred by Labour.\n\nSome in the party say the later date reduces the number of more liberal students voting because it comes after they finish their semesters and return home for the winter break.\n\nLabour's trade spokesman Barry Gardiner told BBC radio \"the first thing\" for Mr Johnson to do to get his party's backing was \"to ensure that students are not going to be disenfranchised by an election on December 12\".\n\nMr Corbyn did not specify a date in his statement.\n\n\"It will be a December election,\" a Labour source told AFP.\n\nThe last election to be held in December was in 1923, when Labour's Ramsay McDonald lost to the Conservatives led by Stanley Baldwin.\n\nThe debate appears to be one of principle.\n\nThe SNP's parliamentary leader Ian Blackford urged Labour to not \"be the handmaidens to the prime minister's Brexit\" and to fight for the earlier date.\n\nMr Johnson is mainly concerned about amendments that could be attached to his bill.\n\nOne proposed option would extend voting rights to EU citizens, a group that strongly opposed Brexit.\n\nAnother would lower the voting age from 18 to 16.\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [LONDON] Britain looked set Tuesday for a pre-Christmas election after the main opposition Labour party backed Prime Minister Boris Johnson's push for an early vote to try to overcome the lengthening political deadlock caused by Brexit. .
