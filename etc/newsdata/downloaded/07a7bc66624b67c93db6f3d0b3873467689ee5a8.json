Burchardt (\u201cBurchardt\u201d), the Company\u2019s former CEO, over disputed amounts for unpaid salary, severance and benefits amounts allegedly owing to Burchardt after his resignation from the Company in January 2017.

The Company believes Burchardt\u2019s demand is without merit and intends to vigorously defend its position.\n\n\n\nABOUT HEMOSTEMIX INC.\n\nHemostemix is a publicly traded clinical-stage biotechnology company that develops and commercializes innovative blood-derived cell therapies for medical conditions not adequately addressed by current treatments. It is one of the first clinical-stage biotech companies to test a stem-cell therapy in an international, multicenter, Phase II clinical trial for patients with critical limb ischemia (\u201cCLI\u201d), a severe form of peripheral artery disease (\u201cPAD\u201d) caused by reduced blood flow to the legs. The Phase II trial targets a participant\u2019s diseased tissue with proprietary cells grown from his or her blood that can support the formation of new blood vessels. The Company\u2019s intellectual property portfolio includes over 50 patents issued or pending throughout the world. Hemostemix has a manufacturing contract with Aspire Health Science, LLC (\u201cAspire\u201d), for the production of ACP-01 and for research and development purposes at Aspire\u2019s Orlando, Florida, facility. Building towards commercialization, Hemostemix has also licensed the use, sale and import of ACP-01 for certain indications to Aspire in certain jurisdictions.
