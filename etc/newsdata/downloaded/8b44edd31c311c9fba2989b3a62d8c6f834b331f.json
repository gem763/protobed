Learn more at https://www.kfw-ipex-bank.de/International-financing/KfW-IPEX-Bank/ .\n\nMike Ferguson, President & CEO of Gensource, commented \u201cAfter an exhaustive and thorough process researching alternatives in the senior loan market, we are extremely pleased to appoint KfW IPEX-Bank as the Lead Arranger of the senior Debt Facility for Tugaske. We see KfW IPEX-Bank as a partner in the execution of the Project and are excited to have reached this important milestone. KfW IPEX-Bank has a tremendous track record in project finance and, specifically, has experience in the fertilizer industry. They understand the opportunities as well as the technical and financial issues facing new potash producers. Gensource continues on a strong footing with KfW IPEX-Bank acting as Lead Arranger.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement, in conjunction with the news release of October 15, 2019, shows that Gensource has solidly advanced both equity and debt for the Tugaske Project. Having our equity partners invested in the project up-front (see the royalty and private placement news release of October 15th), combined with the mandate announced today of KfW IPEX-Bank as Lead Arranger for the debt facility means that Tugaske is well positioned to move ahead into construction and operation.\u201d\n\nAgreements, negotiated over the past many weeks, have been executed by the parties, indicating that:\n\nKfW IPEX-Bank will be the Lead Arranger to arrange the Debt Facility for the Tugaske Project.\n\nA total Debt Facility of approximately USD 180 million is agreed.\n\nA significant portion of the Facility is to have Export Credit Agency (ECA) coverage to reduce lender risks and the Project\u2019s interest costs; ECA due diligence will also be overseen and managed by KfW IPEX-Bank.\n\nKfW IPEX-Bank will complete its due diligence work, including the in-depth review of technical, environmental, social, market and financial aspects of the project.\n\nKfW IPEX-Bank will manage syndication of the Debt Facility and plans to support the Project with a significant take and hold commitment.\n\nDuring the due diligence process, final definitive terms for the Facility will be developed and agreed. Following this, Gensource and KfW IPEX-Bank will prepare and execute definitive facility and security documentation at financial close. The ultimate financing of the Project is conditional upon the successful completion of the detailed due diligence process.\n\nAbout KfWIPEX-Bank\n\nKfW IPEX-Bank is an affiliate of KfW Bank Group. In its responsibility of international project and export finance within the larger KfW Bank Group it is in charge for over EUR 66 billion in assets, completed EUR 17.7 billion in new financings in 2018 and is AA+/Aa2 rated.

Gensource\u2019 President & CEO, Mike Ferguson, P.Eng., has assembled a management and technical team with direct and specific expertise and experience in potash development in Saskatchewan.\n\nGensource operates under a business plan that has two key components: (1) vertical integration with the market to ensure that all production capacity built is directed, and pre-sold, to a specific market, eliminating market-side risk; and (2) technical innovation which will allow for a small and economic potash production facility, which is much friendlier to the environment to construct and operate \u2013 the output of which can then be directed to a single, specific market.\n\nGensource is working with Roc Global LLC of New York as its exclusive financial advisor\n\nFor further information about the Company please contact:\n\nNeither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\n\nCaution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\n\nThis news release may contain forward looking information and Gensource cautions readers that forward- looking information is based on certain assumptions and risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations of Gensource included in this news release.
