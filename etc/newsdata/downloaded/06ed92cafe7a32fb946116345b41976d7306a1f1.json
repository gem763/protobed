I really struggled with that early on,\" Murray said. \"I was mistiming the ball. I felt quite slow on the court, and he was pretty much dictating all of the points. I managed kind of early on in the second set to start putting a bit more on my ball, going for my shots a little bit more.\"\n\nMurray is now 5-6 on tour since returning to action after his successful hip surgery. He won his first singles match at a tour-level event two weeks ago at Zhuhai, China, then made it to the China Open quarterfinals in Beijing last week.\n\n\"These last few weeks I have played more matches,\" Murray said. \"It's starting to get a little bit more used to starting to compete at this level again.", "description": "Andy Murray continued to make progress in his comeback from injury by winning his first-round match at the Shanghai Masters on Monday.", "authors": ["Telegraph Sport", "Simon Briggs"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/tennis/2019/10/07/TELEMMGLPICT000212319203-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwe6-ZVnhtjBVmIetOaROfvM.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
