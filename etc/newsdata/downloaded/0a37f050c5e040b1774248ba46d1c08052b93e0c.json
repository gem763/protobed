There are built in bookshelves and a fireplace finished with a timber mantlepiece.\n\n(Image: Savills)\n\n(Image: Savills)\n\nThe luxury doesn't end downstairs either, as the master bedroom with its en-suite and dressing room looks out directly onto the Dee estuary - it also comes with a roof terrace.\n\nThere is another double bedroom at the front of the house with a covered balcony, plus a guest room which also has its own en-suite.\n\nTwo further bedrooms can also be found at the back of the house which include built in shelves and cupboards - perfect to store your designer clothes and accessories.\n\n(Image: Savills)\n\n(Image: Savills)\n\n(Image: Savills)\n\nNo expense has been spared outside either, as a sandstone terrace leads down to tiered gardens.\n\nThe lower lawn is guarded by hedges and gives access to the tennis court and pavillion. The grounds also feature a rock garden complete with an ornamental pond.\n\n(Image: Savills)\n\n(Image: Savills)\n\nCharlie Kannreuther, head of residential sales at Savills in the North West and West Midlands, comments: \"I was blown away by the incredible views on my first visit to Roughlands.\n\n\"Set in landscaped gardens in a private spot on the Wirral, and bordering mature woodlands and National Trust land, the house offers open views across the Dee Estuary to the North Wales coast.\n\n(Image: Savills)\n\n\"This beautiful and functional family home offers an outstanding combination of privacy and accessibility, ideally situated for access to Liverpool and Chester, yet enjoying a large, secluded plot.\n\n\"It is on the market for only the third time since its construction in 1928.\"\n\nIf you're looking for a new home and Roughlands has taken your fancy, you can view the listing here - it's listed for a staggering \u00a31.94 million.", "description": "A five-bedroom mansion on the Wirral peninsula is up for sale for only the third time since its construction in 1928 - and it's yours for just under \u00a32 million.", "authors": ["Joshua Minchin", "Image", "Savills"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20566185.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_THP_CHP_121019Slug_10736JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
