Why should it be dragged into this matter now, again?\n\n\"When our clients were raped they were 11 and 12 years old. He was a young man in his 40s when he committed the crimes,\" said Koen.\n\nShe added that her clients would never be released from their horrible experiences.\n\n\"While he has served three of his six-year sentence, his victims have been sentenced to life imprisonment,\" she said.", "description": "Convicted rapist and former tennis star Bob Hewitt is to remain behind bars after the Correctional Supervision and Parole Review Board reviewed and set aside his parole placement.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9464/88e89d6fd2624d35909f841ee153e46b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
