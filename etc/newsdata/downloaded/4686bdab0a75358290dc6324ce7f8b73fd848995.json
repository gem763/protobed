That is, across all financial markets, the maxim is that as risk goes up, so does reward. Because of this, you won\u2019t find many low-risk stocks with multi-bagger potential. Instead, all the stocks with multi-bagger potential are often also accompanied with big risks.\n\nThus, if you\u2019re looking for a multi-bagger stock that could rise 200% or more, it\u2019s safe to say that you are looking at stocks with big risk profiles.\n\nThe key in picking winners in this group is to identify the stocks that are more likely to go boom than bust. That is, find the stocks where the upside is compelling enough \u2014 and the probability of the stock realizing that upside is high enough \u2014 to more than compensate for the risks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDon\u2019t have the time to do all that analysis across hundreds of small cap stocks? No worries. I\u2019ve done some of that leg work for you. Without further ado, then, let\u2019s take a look at 5 small cap stocks that could soar 200% or more over the next five years.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlug Power (PLUG)\n\nThe 7 Best Penny Stocks to Buy More\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCurrent Price: $2.80\n\nPotential 2024 Price: $12\n\nFive Year Upside Potential: ~330%\n\nFirst up, we have hydrogen fuel cell maker Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG). Most infamous for its 99.9% decline from 2000 to 2019, PLUG stock actually now has all the ingredients of a potential multi-bagger over the next few years.\n\nHere\u2019s the logic. Hydrogen fuel cell technology has lagged electric battery technology in terms of alternative fuel adoption for several years. But hydrogen tech is starting to catch on. This is especially true in the commercial market, where large enterprises are starting to value the longer life and shorter re-charging times hydrogen fuel cells offer versus their electric battery counterparts. This is largely why Plug Power had reported 20%-plus revenue growth since 2016.\n\nManagement expects this big growth to continue, driven by expansion of HFC adoption in core commercial markets. Specifically, management is pointing towards $1 billion in revenue by 2024, with $200 million in EBITDA. Is that possible? Yes, but unlikely. Nonetheless, if Plug Power does hit those aggressive targets, the numbers shake out for the company to net about $0.50 in EPS by 2024 and likely somewhere around $0.60 in EPS by 2025.\n\nApply a growth stock average 20-times forward multiple to that $0.60 EPS base in 2025. That implies a 2024 price target of $12, which means that in an \u201ceverything goes right\u201d scenario, PLUG stock could rally more than 300% from here over the next few years.\n\n\n\n\n\nAphria (APHA)\n\nUnfortunately, Aphria Stock Suffers from Guilt by Association More\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCurrent Price: $6\n\nPotential 2024 Price: $24\n\nFive Year Upside Potential: ~300%\n\nNext up, we have small-cap Canadian cannabis producer Aphria (NASDAQ:APHA). Aphria is most famous on Wall Street as being the first Canadian cannabis company to strike a profit. But the company \u2014 and stock \u2014 could be so much more than that in the long run.\n\nConsider this. Most company and analyst estimates peg the global cannabis market as growing to $200 billion in annual revenues within the next 10 to 15 years. Let\u2019s call it 15 years. Thus, Aphria is at the epicenter of a market that will be $200 billion large in 15 years.\n\nSure, Aphria isn\u2019t a big player in that market. But they have a unique and established value prop as the low cost, discount player in the market. That value prop has enduring demand. So long as Aphria maintains that value prop and dominates the discount cannabis niche, this company will forever command a respectable share in the cannabis market.", "description": "In the stock market, risk and reward are correlated.
