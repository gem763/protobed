Here's What It Entails.", "language": "en", "text": "Gov. Andrew Cuomo has just signed the September 11th Remembrance Day law in New York. The bill will \"allow for a brief moment of silence\" in the state's public schools each September 11 to recognize the terror attacks that occurred exactly 18 years ago today.\n\nThe minute of silence will offer a way for students who were not alive or were mere newborns on September 11, 2001 to learn about the terror attacks and \"their place in history,\" the law explains.\n\n\"9/11 was one of the single darkest periods in this state's and this nation's history, and we owe it to those we lost and to the countless heroes who ran toward danger that day and the days that followed to do everything we can to keep their memory alive,\" Cuomo said in a statement. \"By establishing this annual day of remembrance and a brief moment of silence in public schools, we will help ensure we never forget \u2014 not just the pain of that moment but of the courage, sacrifice and outpouring of love that defined our response.\"\n\nProponents of the law think it should be a nationwide mandate.\n\nIt should be a national law. This is my generations Pearl Harbor, we need to remember those that were slain in both events. Dont forget Shanksville, the Pentagon, NYC, and in December, Pearl Harbor. #NeverForget https://t.co/DVUJwsf6UZ \u2014 Kyle Mateer (@TheSinzia) September 11, 2019\n\nA few of the more liberal hosts on \"The View,\" which is filmed in New York, shared that opinion.\n\nNY PASSES 9/11 MOMENT OF SILENCE LAW FOR SCHOOLS: The co-hosts discuss how students will have a way to honor and understand the history after a new law \u201callows for a brief moment of silence\u201d in the state\u2019s public schools on the anniversary. https://t.co/AeiL5FvlPg pic.twitter.com/9KbLbx4DYX \u2014 The View (@TheView) September 11, 2019\n\n\"I think it should be national,\" said \"The View\" co-host Sunny Hostin. \"It shouldn't just be here in New York because our entire country was affected.\"\n\n\"Why should it be only in New York?\" Joy Behar agreed. \"It was a national tragedy.\"\n\nFor those of us who were alive on September 11, 2001, we know exactly where we were when the twin towers fell.
