George, 49, was jailed indefinitely in 2009, and told to serve a minimum of seven years.\n\n(Image: SnapperSK)\n\n(Image: SnapperSK)\n\nAngry crowds gathered outside the entrance to the property Birmingham, where George is staying, on Saturday afternoon. It is just 500 metres away from a nursery.\n\nProtesters unveiled a banner that read 'Keeping Kids Safe', while some approached the neighbouring nursery and stopped families with young children leaving a birthday part to ask if they knew that George was next door.\n\nWest Midlands police sent several officers to the demonstration, who used police cars to try to prevent the crowds entering the hostel.\n\nA 33-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of making threats to cause criminal damage, and has since been released.\n\n(Image: SnapperSK)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe protest is understood to have been organised by paedophile hunter group 'Predator Awareness' on Facebook.\n\nIn December 2009, George admitted to seven counts of sexual assault and six of making and distributing indecent pictures of children.\n\nThe Daily Star reported that Luke Pollard, MP for Plymouth Sutton and Devonport, opposed her release, saying her victims faced a \"life sentence\" while she enjoyed \"time relaxing in the sunshine\".\n\nHe added: \"Vanessa George shouldn't be allowed out of prison until her victims have reached adulthood as a bare minimum.\n\n(Image: SnapperSK)\n\n(Image: SnapperSK)\n\n\"Many of them are now around 12, 13 or 14... The fact she is out is a disgrace when the families are still suffering.\"\n\nThe parole board approved George's release in July on the condition she is no longer allowed to own a phone or other device capable of accessing the internet.\n\nShe is also not allowed to return to Devon and Cornwall or work with children", "description": "Former nursery worker George is staying in Birmingham after serving 10 years in prison for abusing dozens of children in Plymouth", "authors": ["Pippa Allen-Kinross", "Image", "Snappersk", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article16521777.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_Trio-to-face-court-on-child-abuse-charges.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
