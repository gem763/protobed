The man mostly targeted cars, but he sometimes defaced storefronts with the stinky stuff.\n\nIt is unclear if the poop is Hu\u2019s own or if it is someone else\u2019s.\n\nPolice charged Hu with one felony count of criminal damage to property, one count of misdemeanor criminal damage to property, and nine counts of misdemeanor criminal defacement of property.\n\nHu was released on his own recognizance, but is being monitored under home detention with an electronic device.\n\nHe is due back in court on Tuesday.\n\nHu is not the first to be accused of being a \u201cMad Pooper.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, a Colorado jogger was nicknamed the \u201cMad Pooper\u201d by authorities and residents who say she defecated on several homeowners\u2019 lawns at least once a week over a two-month period.", "description": "A man has become the nation's' next \"Mad Pooper\" after authorities caught him smearing feces on cars and storefronts in Chicago.", "authors": ["Katherine Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Ke_Hu_1021-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
