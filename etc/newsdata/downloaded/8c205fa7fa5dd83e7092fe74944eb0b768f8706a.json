The feeling within was that Chevrolet had massively overpaid and it was never going to get done again.'\n\nUnited's executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward is confident a new deal will surpass that sum\n\nIndeed, the man who agreed the deal, global marketing chief Joel Ewanick, was axed less than 48 hours after it was announced.\n\nAt the time, it was reported that GM executives were furious when they learned their company would be paying substantially more than United's last sponsor Aon.\n\nIt was also claimed Ewanick failed to give his bosses full details of the agreement before signing off on it, although the man himself later described the deal as a 'no-brainer'.\n\nFigures seen by Sportsmail show the agreement with Chevrolet, which has brought in around \u00a358.6m per season, dwarfs those the club had previously agreed.\n\nAon (2010-14) paid \u00a319.6m a season, AIG (2006-10) \u00a314.1m and Vodafone (2000-2006) \u00a38m.\n\nIt is understood that United have already begun their search for a new sponsor and club insiders say they have had expressions of interest from a number of leading brands.\n\nUnited have endured a tough start to the season and are two points above the bottom three\n\nDespite their stuttering performances on the field, officials are confident in the strength of the brand and believe United's red shirt remains attractive to potential partners, given their global following and the overall popularity of the Premier League.\n\nUnited claimed recently that their following across the world had reached 1.1billion and executive vice chairman Ed Woodward has vowed that sponsorship revenue will be key to the size of their transfer fund.\n\nA United spokesperson said: 'Chevrolet is a fantastic partner. The sponsorship continues to achieve the brand and business objectives for both parties and we will continue to work to activate and maximise it.'\n\nGM did not respond to requests for comment.", "description": "Manchester United are searching for a new shirt sponsor with Chevrolet highly unlikely to renew their deal while the club struggle on the field.
