Security Council resolutionsand remain engaged in substantive and sustained negotiations to do their part to ensure peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and achieve denuclearization.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who did not commenton the latest launch, has played down the North's previous weapons tests involving short-range projectiles. He has said the North Korean leader has not broken an agreement made in the U.S.-North Korean summit in June last year.\n\nThe development of highlymobile, submarine-based missiles represent a bigger threat to the U.S. and its allies than land-based missiles because they are harder to detect in time to respond.\n\nThereport saidthe projectile was fired in a \"verticaltrajectory\" instead of in a more traditionallaunch-angle that would travel farther.\n\nIf fired at a standard trajectory, the missile could have traveled 930 to 1,240 miles, said Kim Dong-yub, an analyst from Seouls Institute for Far Eastern Studies, in a Facebook post, according to The Associated Press.\n\nShin Jong-woo from the Korea Defense and Security Forum in Seoul said the missile appeared similar to a Chinese JL-2 SLBM, indicating that North Korea aims to develop a submarine-launch missilethat cancarry three to eight warheads,South Korea'sYonhap news agency reported.\n\nThe test-firing came as North Korea's chief nuclear negotiator, en route to working-level talks in Sweden with the U.S., expressed \"high expectations and optimism\" over the discussions.\n\n\"As the U.S. side sent a new signal, I bear high expectations and optimism, and I am also optimistic about the results,\"Kim Myong-gil told reporters at Beijing International Capital Airport.\n\nFormer national security adviser John Bolton, in his first remarks since leaving the Trump administration in early September, said Monday that Kim has no intention of giving up nuclear weapons.\n\nThe strategic decision Kim Jong Un is operating through is that he will do whatever he can to keep a deliverable nuclear weapons capability and to develop and enhance it further, Bolton said in remarks at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Under current circumstances, he will never give up the nuclear weapons voluntarily.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: North Korea successfully tests submarine missile; Japan protests\n\n\n\n", "description": "A day after saying it would resume nuclear talks with the US, North Korea said it successfully test-fired a submarine-launched missile.", "authors": ["Doug Stanglin", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/pLtsF.kJLUvQN.TfGdKeDA--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/8e64091ffa137357135d35bbb94abd6a", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
