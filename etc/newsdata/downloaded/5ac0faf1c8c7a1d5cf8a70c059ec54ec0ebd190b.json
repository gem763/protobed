The Index editors recorded modest declines in its scores for fiscal health, labor freedom, monetary freedom and trade freedom.\n\n\u201cNew protectionist policies that have raised tariffs and disrupted established manufacturing supply chains are just beginning to affect consumer prices and investment decisions,\u201d the editors warn.\n\nLaunched in 1995, the Index evaluates countries in four broad policy areas that affect economic freedom: rule of law; government size; regulatory efficiency; and open markets. There are 12 specific categories: property rights, judicial effectiveness, government integrity, tax burden, government spending, fiscal health, business freedom, labor freedom, monetary freedom, trade freedom, investment freedom, and financial freedom. Scores in these categories are averaged to create an overall score.\n\nBased on an average score, each of 180 countries graded in the 2019 Index is classified as \u201cfree\u201d (i.e., combined scores of 80 or higher); \u201cmostly free\u201d (70-79.9); \u201cmoderately free\u201d (60-69.9); \u201cmostly unfree\u201d (50-59.9); or \u201crepressed\u201d (under 50).\n\nThe Americas region has no \u201cfree\u201d economies. Three (Canada, United States, Chile) are \u201cmostly free.\u201d Five (Ecuador, Suriname, Bolivia, Cuba, Venezuela) are \u201crepressed.\u201d The remaining 24 are either \u201cmoderately free\u201d or \u201cmostly unfree.\u201d Seven of its 32 economies improved in the 2019 Index, while 23 declined and two were unchanged.\n\nAcross the region, economies have expanded at an average rate of 1.5 percent over the past five years. The regional average rate of unemployment is 6.9 percent. The average inflation rate has dropped significantly, to 4.4 percent, but the average level of public debt\u2014the highest in the world\u2014has climbed to 75.5 percent of GDP.\n\nThe Index groups the world\u2019s countries into five regions: the Americas, Asia-Pacific, Europe, Middle East/North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa. Individual rankings and write-ups for each country can be found online at heritage.org/index/ranking.\n\nThe 2019 Index was edited by Ambassador Terry Miller, Director of Heritage\u2019s Center for International Trade and Economics; Anthony B. Kim, the Center\u2019s Research Manager; and James M. Roberts, the Center\u2019s Research Fellow for Economic Freedom and Growth.\n\nAn interactive version of the Index, including full text, charts and graphs is available online at heritage.org/index.
