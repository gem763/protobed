His contribution to the history of our nation and continent will never be forgotten. May his soul rest in eternal peace.\u201d\n\nA Downing Street spokesperson said: \"There will be mixed emotions in Zimbabwe at today's news. We of course express our condolences to those who mourn, but know that for many he was a barrier to a brighter future.\n\n\"Under his rule, the people of Zimbabwe suffered greatly as he impoverished their country and sanctioned the use of violence against them.\n\n\"His resignation in 2017 marked a turning point and we hope that today marks another which allows Zimbabwe to move on from the legacy of its past and become a democratic, prosperous nation that respects the human rights of its citizens.\"\n\nBorn in 1924 in what was then Rhodesia, Mugabe went on to co-found a resistance movement against British colonial rule, and was jailed for 10 years between 1964 and 1974.\n\nHe ruled Zimbabwe for nearly four decades, before he was forced out in a military coup in November 2017.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

He will be remembered for his fight for Africa's liberation and fearlessly defending the continent. His place in the annals of Africa's history is assured. We mourns with Zimbabwe.\"\n\nBut former Africa minister and anti-apartheid campaigner Lord Hain said Mugabe had turned from being a \u201cbrave liberation hero\u201d into a ruthless dictator who squandered Zimbabwe\u2019s potential.\n\nHe added that Mugabe\u2019s legacy would be \u201cvery two-sided\u201d, with the early promise of his leadership outweighed by the \u201ccorrupt, repressive, dictatorial\u201d approach he adopted.\n\n\u201cHe is a tragic case study of a liberation hero who then betrayed every one of the values of the freedom struggle,\u201d the Labour peer said.\n\n\u201cHis legacy will be very two-sided.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand \u2013 brave liberation hero who suffered imprisonment and torture and whom anti-apartheid activists like myself at the time were thrilled to see elected in a landslide in early 1980 with a promise to build a new, non-racial Zimbabwe which respected everybody and brought all races together and somebody who liberated his country from minority, white racist rule under Ian Smith and the old Rhodesia.\n\n\u201cThat will be the positive memory.\n\n\u201cBut the overwhelmingly negative memory that everybody will have I think is of that liberation hero who was a case study of the leader who betrayed all the values of the freedom struggle and became corrupt, repressive, dictatorial, self-serving and ruthless in eliminating opposition and becoming increasingly interested in enriching himself and impoverishing his own people.\u201d\n\nZimbabwean opposition senator and human rights lawyer David Coltart said on Twitter: \u201cHe was a colossus on the Zimbabwean stage & his enduring positive legacy will be his role in ending white minority rule & expanding a quality education to all Zimbabweans.\u201d\n\nLabour MP Kate Hoey, formerly the chairwoman of the all-party Parliamentary group on Zimbabwe and a longtime critic of Mugabe, wrote: \"Mugabe brought independence to Zimbabwe and then killed in the Gukurahundi-up to 80,000 of his own citizens in Matabeleland and brought his country to its knees economically. \"A hero to a brutal dictator.\" Zimbabwe election: Shots fired at protesting crowds in Harare as violence escalates Former Zimbabwe international cricketer Henry Olonga - who was exiled from his home country and faced death threats after standing up to Mugabe in Harare at the 2003 World Cup - called the former president a \"megalomaniac\".\n\nHe told the PA news agency: \"It makes me incredibly sad because, for all he could have represented, he failed to scale the heights of someone like Nelson Mandela, because he became a megalomaniac, a power-hungry tyrant, a dictator and a man who subjugated his own people while purporting to be representing them.\"\n\nMr Olonga's sentiments were shared by human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell, who twice attempted a citizen's arrest on Mugabe, once being knocked unconscious.\n\nMr Tatchell said: \"The world had so much hope for the freedom fighter who suffered imprisonment and later rose to power on a promise to build a new, democratic, non-racial Zimbabwe. But the truth is that he betrayed it all for a repressive, dictatorial, self-serving regime that boosted his personal wealth while impoverishing his own people.\"\n\nAgencies contributed to this report", "description": "Zimbabwe\u2019s long-serving president Robert Mugabe has died in Singapore at the age of 95, with the mixed\u00a0reactions\u00a0to his death reflecting his complex and controversial legacy. \u00a0 Mugabe had been travelling\u00a0regularly\u00a0to Singapore for treatment and\u00a0died on Thursday after a long battle with illness, his family said.", "authors": ["Adam Withnall"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/30/12/zimbabwe-election-26.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
