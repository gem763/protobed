Sanchez summaries Mises distinction:\n\nThe only way in which \u201csocialism of the Russian or Lenin pattern\u201d (as Mises termed the more familiar variant of socialism) is distinct from the Zwangswirtschaft [which is basically German for \u201ccompulsory economy\u201d] is in the nonessential fact it has no such veneer of faux-private ownership. Its socialism is simply more overt. Another way of stating this is as follows. In the populist propaganda of Bolshevism, under \u201csocialism of the Russian or Lenin pattern the people ostensibly own the state, and the state in turn owns the means of production. While, under the sham capitalism of Nazism and \u201csocialism of the German or Hindenburg pattern,\u201d the people ostensibly own the means of production, but the state in turn owns the people. Thus these occupants of different political \u201cpoles\u201d really occupy the same ground and are only separated by a trivial technically: the existence or absence of a sham market. Each variant of socialism does indeed have its own distinctive path. But it has nothing to do with \u201cleft vs. right,\u201d \u201cpoor vs. rich,\u201d or \u201cweak vs. powerful.\u201d Rather, it is a matter of \u201cbureaucratization vs. interventionism.\u201d Bureaucratization, by forthrightly gobbling up the market bite by bite, leads to the overt socialism of the Russian or Lenin pattern. Interventionism, by subtly crippling the market and replacing it incrementally with a network of government diktats, leads to the sham market of socialism of the German or Hindenburg pattern.[4]\n\nLew Rockwell reveals collectivism is a lie, and a lie from Lucifer himself because only the individual with God can build true prosperity. Rockwell divulges the lie when he explains that we, as individuals, must build it ourselves. This illustrates the analogy of Lucifer versus God is parallel to the State versus the Individual. The collectivist state \u201cfastens a huge, violent, lumbering state on the free market that drains its capital and productivity like a deadly parasite on a host.\u201d[5] Government can only consume or destroy wealth, and as Ludwig von Mises astutely asserted, \u201cState interference in economic life, which calls itself \u2018economic policy\u2019, has done nothing but destroy economic life.\u201d[6]\n\nThis is why American at its founding attached itself to God the Creator, not to the State.\n\n[1] Ben O\u2019Neill, 2011, \u201cThe Vampire Economy and the Market: An Assessment of Economic and Political Dynamics,\u201d (New Perspectives on Political Economy: A bilingual interdisciplinary journal, Vol. 7, No. 1), p. 143.\n\n[2] Ben O\u2019Neill, 2011, \u201cThe Vampire Economy and the Market: An Assessment of Economic and Political Dynamics,\u201d (New Perspectives on Political Economy: A bilingual interdisciplinary journal, Vol. 7, No. 1), p. 141.\n\n[3] Ludwig von Mises, 1998 (originally published in 1949), Human Action: A Treatise on Economics, (Auburn, AL: Ludwig von Mises Institute), pp. 713-715, Chapter 27, Section 2.\n\n[4] Daniel James Sanchez, September 5, 2012, \u201cFalse Choices and the True Dilemma,\u201d Mises Daily, (Auburn, AL: Ludwig von Mises Institute), [http://mises.org/daily/5080/False-Choices-and-the-True-Dilemma].\n\n[5] Llewellyn H.
