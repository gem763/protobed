But that is what actor Denzel Washington opts for when he walks in through a grand, gray foyer. As vigilante Robert McCall in the flick \"Equalizer II,\" he metes out justice to five affluent lads, engaged in dubious actions in the dazzling lair.\n\nA year after its Hollywood cameo, that stately apartment, sited in Boston\u2019s Millennium Tower, is now on the market.\n\n\"One-of-a-kind property in the clouds,\" \"timeless,\" \"thoughtfully done\" are phrases listing agents Haley Cutter and Pamela Cushing of Douglas Elliman\u2019s Live in Luxury real estate team used to describe the penthouse.\n\nThe seller, Greg Agganis, purchased the home on the 59th floor of the development in 2016\u2014the first person to commit to a unit in the then newly constructed Millennium Tower.\n\nMore: Ninth-Floor Penthouse in Boston\u2019s New Pier 4 Luxury Condo Complex\n\n\"I bought concrete, raw space and customized it,\" Mr. Agganis said.\n\nIn nine months, he transformed the unassuming shell of a penthouse into a sumptuous residence of cosmopolitan flair.\n\n\"I wanted to bring in a more modern Miami-style feel but with a Boston touch to it,\" Mr. Agganis said.\n\nTo that end, he covered the 14-feet-high rooms in white hues, installed three fireplaces, built a butler\u2019s bar, imported bathroom tiles from Italy and hung custom paintings by Italian artist Fernando Cusato.\n\n\"Although it\u2019s elegant and breathtaking, it feels like home, really comfortable and cozy,\" Ms. Cushing said of the home\u2019s aesthetic.\n\nBut as spectacular the interior is, so are the vistas that frame it.\n\nMore: On Martha\u2019s Vineyard, All Eyes on Obama\u2019s Real Estate\n\nClaiming a southwest corner on the second to last floor of Millennium Tower, some 600 feet above the ground, the penthouse\u2014through its 44 floor-to-ceiling windows\u2014reveals views of the Charles River, Back Bay and Boston Common, a central public park.\n\n\"With this particular view that this building allows, it\u2019s probably going to be one of the few buildings in Boston that will have this view ever,\" Mr. Agganis said.\n\nStats\n\nSpread on a little over 4,000 square feet, the penthouse boasts three bedrooms, four bathrooms and a single half bath. It also has a 200-square-foot loggia off the kitchen and comes with two parking spots.\n\nMore: Boston\u2019s Luxury-Defining Neighborhoods\n\nAmenities\n\nFlanked by walls on three sides, the deck is built into the building to offer year-round use, away from the elements.\n\n\"Other than the grand penthouse [that is above the unit], [the loggia is perhaps] the highest outdoor space in the city of Boston,\" Mr. Agganis said.\n\nIts location near the kitchen and the service bar helps elevate the open-floor concept of the property into an entertainment locus. Meanwhile, a second entrance to the penthouse allows for deliveries and behind-the-scenes preparation that do not disturb guests.\n\nWhen it comes to hosting soirees, however, residents of Millennium Tower enjoy quite a few options. The common, two-floor amenity space, dubbed The Club, flaunts its own private restaurant, headed by celebrity chef Michael Mina, a dining room, a bar, a lounge as well as a terrace.\n\nAlso available for tower dwellers are a spa and a 75-feet indoor pool, a hair salon, a movie room, a children\u2019s playroom and what Ms. Cushing described as \"the largest resident-only fitness center in the city.\"\n\nMillennium Tower also curates a calendar of social gatherings for its occupants.\n\nFrom Penta: Why Hotels Are Getting Guests Up Close and Personal With Their Favorite Drinks\n\n\"The building really has all the bells and whistles,\" Ms. Cutter said. \"Not only do they want to give you beautiful space to get together and gather, but a reason to get together. It\u2019s a community unlike anything that I\u2019ve experienced in the city.\"\n\nNeighborhood notes\n\nTalking about Boston, Millennium Tower rises in its heart, near boutiques, restaurants and stores. Close to transportation stops, the development is also near the city\u2019s oldest thoroughfare, Washington Street, which bustles with the vibrancy of a downtown hotspot.\n\n\"It\u2019s a true live-work-play\" place, Ms. Cutter said.\n\nView the listing here.\n\nWrite to Listing of the Day", "description": "Some 600 feet above ground, this residence provides amenity-rich lifestyle in the heart of Boston", "authors": ["Dima Williams"], "top_image": "https://static2.mansionglobal.com/production/media/article-images/6c6de9cbd2e0a1e10425039f690f291a/large_MillenniumTower_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
