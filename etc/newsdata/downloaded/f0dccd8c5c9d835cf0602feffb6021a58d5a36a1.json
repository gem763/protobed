His other no-no was in 2007 for the Tigers against Milwaukee.\n\nThe 36-year-old Verlander joined Nolan Ryan (seven), Sandy Koufax (four) and Bob Feller, Cy Young and Larry Corcoran (three) in rarefied air on the no-hitter list.\n\nDETROIT (AP) - The Minnesota Twins have broken the major league home run record with their 268th of the season.\n\nThe Twins passed the mark set last year by the New York Yankees when Mitch Garver homered in the ninth inning at Detroit on Saturday night. It was Minnesota\u2019s sixth homer of the game, although the Twins lost 10-7.\n\nGarver homered twice, and Nelson Cruz, Max Kepler, Jorge Polanco and C.J. Cron also hit home runs for Minnesota. The Twins also passed the 1997 Seattle Mariners (264 homers) during the game.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - CC Sabathia has been placed on the injured list for the fourth time this year by the New York Yankees.\n\nThe 39-year-old lefty, who plans to retire after the season, was removed from his start Friday night against Oakland due to a recurrence of pain in a balky right knee that\u2019s bothered him for years. He was put on the 10-day injured list Saturday with right knee inflammation, and the Yankees recalled right-hander Jonathan Loaisiga from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.\n\nSabathia was scheduled to have his knee drained and receive a cortisone shot Saturday. He could be given another lubricant injection as well, all part of a treatment regimen that\u2019s become common for the six-time All-Star over the past few years.\n\nST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) - Carlos Carrasco made his return to the mound from leukemia Sunday and the Cleveland Indians pitcher was applauded by both teams in a touching scene during Tampa Bay\u2019s 8-2 victory that completed a three-game sweep.\n\nThe right-hander entered in the seventh inning for his first major league appearance since being diagnosed with a treatable form of leukemia in June. He received a standing ovation from the Tropicana Field crowd, and players from both sides cheered while standing in front of their respective dugouts.\n\nNormally a starter, Carrasco is expected to pitch in relief for the Indians as they chase a playoff spot down the stretch. He worked one inning and gave up two hits, including Travis d\u2019Arnaud\u2019s run-scoring single.\n\nTENNIS\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - Novak Djokovic ended his U.S. Open title defense by retiring from his fourth-round match against Stan Wawrinka.\n\nDjokovic was seeded No. 1 and seeking a fourth championship in New York.\n\nBut he\u2019s been troubled by a painful left shoulder and did not look to be close to his best for much of the night against Wawrinka.\n\nDjokovic was trailing 6-4, 7-5, 2-1 when he quit on Sunday.\n\nNFL\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) - LeSean McCoy is going from a rebuilding franchise in Buffalo to a Super Bowl contender in Kansas City, and he\u2019s reuniting with his close friend and former coach Andy Reid, too.\n\nThe Chiefs and the two-time All-Pro running back have agreed to a $4 million, 1-year deal, a person with knowledge of the negotiations told The Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because McCoy must still pass a physical, which could be completed as early as Sunday.\n\nThat would allow him the week to prepare for the Chiefs\u2019 opener in Jacksonville next Sunday.\n\nMcCoy would become the top backup to Damien Williams, likely siphoning carries from rookie Darwin Thompson and backup Darrell Williams.\n\n-By AP Sports Writer Dave Skretta.\n\nCOLLEGE FOOTBALL\n\nALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) - New Mexico coach Bob Davie was recovering in a hospital Saturday night after \u201ca serious medical incident\u201d moments after his team\u2019s victory against Sam Houston State.\n\nThe school released a statement from the Davie family, saying the 64-year-old coach was \u201cdoing well\u201d and surrounded by family.\n\nThat came about an hour after athletic director Eddie Nunez made the announcement that Davie had been taken to the hospital after the Lobos won 39-31 at home. According to the Albuquerque Journal, the 64-year-old Davie several times during the game could be seen with his hands on his midsection and chest. At one point, the newspaper reporter, Davie kneeled down during the action.\n\nDavie\u2019s wife, Joanne Davie, was seen in the ambulance\u2019s front seat as it left for nearby University of New Mexico Hospital.\n\n\u201cCoach Davie is doing well and recovering, he is surrounded by family and your continued thoughts, prayers, and privacy are greatly appreciated during this time,\u201d the family said.\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) - Southern California quarterback J.T.

Things finally ended at close to 2 a.m., some eight hours after the event\u2019s scheduled start.\n\nBusch led the most laps at 118, despite starting from the back because of an engine switch. Busch looked like he\u2019d end in second before hitting the wall on the next-to-last lap and dropping to third.\n\nLarson was second.

Although it was two spots behind challenger Alexander Rossi, who finished third, Newgarden goes to the season finale at Laguna Seca with a 41-point lead over Rossi.\n\nNewgarden is seeking his second title in three years.\n\nSPA-FRANCORCHAMPS, Belgium (AP) - Charles Leclerc just held off Lewis Hamilton to win the Belgian Grand Prix from pole position on Sunday, securing the first victory of his Formula One career and ending Ferrari\u2019s long wait for a win.\n\nHamilton was within one second of Leclerc on the final lap, but the 21-year-old from Monaco held his nerve.\n\nLeclerc dedicated it to the French driver Anthoine Hubert who died Saturday, following a heavy crash during an F2 race held on the same track.

(AP) - Australia\u2019s Hannah Green overcame a three-shot deficit with a final round 5-under 67 Sunday to win the Portland Classic and deny teenager Yealimi Noh\u2019s bid to become the third Monday qualifier to win on the LPGA Tour.\n\nGreen erased a three-shot deficit with two birdies over the final four holes at Columbia Edgewater Country Club. She finished at 21 under and won for the second time this season. She claimed the KPGM Women\u2019s PGA Championship in June.\n\nThe 18-year-old Noh, who turned down an offer to play for UCLA and instead went pro in February, led by three strokes entering the final round and held the same margin after 14 holes.

His last one was also in Canada at the 2014 Quebec Championship.\n\nMcCarron rolled in a 39-foot putt for eagle on the 18th hole to card a round of 5-under 65, which pulled him into a tie for the lead with Short and Tom Gillis at 12 under. He then watched as Short made his clutch birdie, while Gillis fell back into fourth at 10 under with a double bogey on the last hole.\n\nSecond-round leader Steve Flesch shot 69 to fall back into third at 11 under. Joe Durant, Billy Andrade and Tom Byrum finished in a tie for fifth at 9 under.\n\nCRANS-MONTANA, Switzerland (AP) - Sebastian Soderberg won a five-man playoff for the European Masters title on Sunday, sinking his birdie putt on the first extra hole when Rory McIlroy and others could not.\n\nHistory repeated itself for McIlroy at the Crans-sur-Sierre club in the Swiss Alps, where he lost a playoff as a 19-year-old in 2008.\n\nSoderberg seemed to waste his best chance of victory on the 17th green, three-putting from five feet to fall into a share of the lead at 14 under.\n\nThe 28-year-old Swede carded a 4-under 66 for a 266 total, alongside his playing partners McIlroy (67) and Lorenzo Gagli (67), and was soon joined by Kalle Samooja (67) and third-round leader Andres Romero (70).\n\nFIGURE SKATING\n\nLAKE PLACID, N.Y.
