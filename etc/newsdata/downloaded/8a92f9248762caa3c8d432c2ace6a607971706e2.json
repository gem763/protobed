REUTERS/Mayank Bhardwaj/Files\n\nEvery year, at this time, farmers in states surrounding the sprawling mega-city are burning off the crop straw and stubble in preparation for the sowing season.\n\nThe smoke from fields combines with urban pollution from vehicles and industry to make New Delhi the world\u2019s most-polluted capital.\n\n\u201cThe situation is set to get worse this year,\u201d Vimlendu Jha, an environmental expert on a government panel to clean up the capital, told Reuters, lamenting the dismal impact of a subsidy scheme to persuade farmers to switch to cleaner methods.\n\nThis week in Delhi, levels of PM 2.5, tiny particulate matter that goes deep into the lungs, rose to an \u201cunhealthy\u201d 200 micro-organism per cubic metre. That is double the acceptable level, and it is likely to get worse going into the winter, as cold air and a seasonal reduction in wind leaves pollutants hanging in the atmosphere for longer.\n\nThe government has allocated $160 million for a subsidy scheme offering to cover up to 80% of a mulching and seed drilling machine, called \u201chappy seeder machines\u201d, that farmers can mount on tractors to dispose of the paddy stalks and straw without burning them.\n\nBut, as often happens in India, good intentions, according to farmers, have been hampered, by poor implementation.\n\nReuters spoke to 50 farmers in Punjab and Haryana states, two of the states bordering Delhi, and found that only 20% of used the machines.\n\nBureaucrats believe the fault lies with the farmers, and subsidies alone are not the answer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s mindset, and behaviour that needs to be changed,\u201d said Ashwani Kumar, an official at the federal agriculture ministry.\n\nThe National Green Tribunal (NGT), the main environmental court of India, has banned crop residue burning, but the ban is rarely enforced.\n\nDelhi did have its best air quality in nine years in September, with PM 2.5 averaging 40, but the improvement was largely down to heavy rains and strong winds clearing the atmosphere, rather than people changing their ways.\n\nGOING UP IN SMOKE\n\nField burning is up by 45% in Punjab over the last 20 days compared with the same period last year. Haryana has registered a slight drop but officials expect the numbers to go up in the next 15-20 days.\n\nIn the Karnal district of Haryana, 117 km (73 miles) north of Delhi, a Reuters reporter saw farmers burning tracts of their land.\n\nFarmer Ramesh Singh said he had thought about not torching his land this year because he didn\u2019t want to break the law.\n\nBut in the end the effort to purchase machines that cost upwards of 350,000 Indian rupees ($4,915) and the paperwork required to claim the subsidy proved too much.\n\n\u201cLast year, I promised myself I wouldn\u2019t set the rice paddy residue on fire to clear my field for planting winter crops,\u201d said Singh. \u201cBut as the new sowing season drew closer, I started running out of time and I reluctantly set the farm waste on fire to prepare the field for wheat planting.\u201d\n\nAfter harvesting rice in late September, farmers have to plant wheat and rapeseed by mid- or late-October, as any delay will result in lower crop yields.\n\nAnd they say the time between clearing the land and the sowing season is too short for them to be worrying about Delhi\u2019s pollution.\n\nThe smoke from their fields accounts for nearly one-quarter of Delhi\u2019s winter air pollution, and as it is a quicker fix than cleaning up industry or improving public transport to reduce the traffic in a city of 20 million people, authorities have prioritised stamping out the practice of burning crop stubble.\n\nTORTUOUS PROCESS\n\nUnder the subsidy scheme, individual farmers can claim back 50% of the cost of \u201chappy seeders\u201d while a group of growers, or farmers\u2019 cooperatives, are entitled to reclaim 80% of the cost.\n\nThe downside for farmers is that the need to pay upfront, and to claim the subsidies, they say they have to submit three sets of applications, six separate forms, receipts for buying the machines and clearances from half a dozen local government offices. And once all the papers are submitted, everything depends on how fast the bureaucrats process the claim.\n\nSmoke billows from paddy waste stubble as it burns in a field in Karnal district of the northern state of Haryana, September 30, 2019.
