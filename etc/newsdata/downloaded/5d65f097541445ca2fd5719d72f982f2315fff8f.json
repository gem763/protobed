When you\u2019re in the bush there\u2019s usually no Wi-Fi or mobile reception, which means you completely disconnect. There\u2019s also something incredibly restorative about being in nature.\n\nHow many hikes have you gone on?\n\nSeven so far, with two planned for next year \u2013 the Camino de Santiago in Spain and the Three Capes Track in Tasmania.\n\nWhat's the longest hike you have undertaken?\n\nThe four-day Milford Track walk in New Zealand. We made it, although day three was tough. The normal track was shut because of avalanches, so we were sent down the emergency track. On the descent from Mackinnon Pass, there were times when I was climbing down makeshift steps, where the height between each step was almost half my height. It was a slow and slightly tortuous route.\n\nMichelle Gibbings and her husband Craig Salisbury make their way down from the top of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo.\n\nHow often do you go hiking?\n\nAs often as I can, with a minimum of one big trip annually.\n\nWhat are your hiking ambitions?\n\nTo keep hiking. The list of hikes on the \u201cto do\u201d list is long: Larapinta (Northern Territory), the Annapurna Circuit (Nepal), the Inca Trail (Peru) and Routeburn (New Zealand) are next in line.\n\nWhat's your favourite hike?\n\nThe one I am thinking about next. Half the fun is in the planning! The Overland Track (Tasmania) and Milford Track (New Zealand) are very beautiful walks, and we were fortunate on both treks that the weather largely held out for us. We did the Milford Track in so-called \u201cfreedom style\u201d, which meant no showers and shared dormitories for four days. In contrast, with the Overland Track on Cradle Mountain, we took the more luxurious option. Having a hot shower at the end of the day and someone cook for you is a winning combination.\n\nMost exhilarating moment?\n\nGetting to the top of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo at 5am to watch the sunrise. We had to get up at 2am to be ready, and then it was a slow walk \u2013 in the dark \u2013 to the summit. When the sun came up, we saw that we were sitting above the clouds. It was magical.\n\nHow did you get into hiking and how old were you?\n\nI did a lot of bushwalking when I was growing up. Although, in my early years I spent much of that sitting on my dad\u2019s shoulders and grumbling if I was made to walk. After university, life and work took over and I stopped getting out into the bush. About five years ago, inspired by friends who hike frequently, I took it up again.", "description": "For Change Meridian boss Michelle Gibbings, nothing beats an arduous climb to watch the sun come up.
