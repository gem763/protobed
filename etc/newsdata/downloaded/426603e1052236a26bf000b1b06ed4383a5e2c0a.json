However, according to The Interpreter, an online journal specializing in Russian affairs there have been claims that these meetings actually took place last week.\n\nThe Kremlin published this photo of a meeting between Putin and Yamalo-Nenets governor Dmitry Kobylkin on Tuesday March 10\n\n\n\nThe Kremlin says this meeting with the Republic of Karelia, Alexander Khudilainen took place on Wednesday March 11\n\n\n\nAt least one observer on Twitter has fueled this rumour by pointing out that the tie Putin is seen wearing in the photo purporting to have been taken on Tuesday was the same as the tie he is seen wearing two days earlier. The ties are different though in the photos dated from Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nAs health rumors mount, Kremlin claims Putin met Kobylkin Mar10\u2014Odd he wore same outfit as on Mar8.
