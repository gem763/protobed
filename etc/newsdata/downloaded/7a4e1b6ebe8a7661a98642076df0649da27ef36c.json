Specifically, she knew there had to be a shift from simply filling a position to focusing on the applicant and making sure they felt satisfied and empowered. \u201cIf the employees are placed well and are happy, the companies they work for will do well,\u201d she said.\n\nTaking a $900 loan from her mom and a giant leap of faith, Bryant Howroyd started her own company in 1978. She founded ActOne Group, a global enterprise that provides employment, workforce management and procurement solutions. The company has since grown into a billion-dollar business with more than 17,000 clients and 2,600 employees in 22 countries.\n\nToday, Bryant Howroyd is one of the richest self-made women in America, with a net worth of $390 million, according to Forbes. In her new book, \"Acting Up,\" she shares her insight and offers advice on how people can use their uniqueness to take on the business world.\n\nBelow is some of Bryant Howroyd\u2019s best advice for anyone hoping to make their entrepreneurial dreams a reality.\n\nFocus on empowerment\n\n\u201cWhen people feel empowered, they find success,\u201d Byrant Howroyd said. By investing in your employees, building relationships and knowing how to provide them with opportunities to reach new goals, the entire company will benefit. Employees will be happier and in turn, will stay motivated and work harder.\n\nWhen helping others feel empowered, it\u2019s also important to realize that you don\u2019t have to arrive at your destination in order to give back to others. It\u2019s just as helpful to give back to others throughout your journey, before all of your own dreams are fulfilled, she added.\n\nNobody wins alone\n\nByrant Howroyd emphasized that it takes a village to find success. \u201cIt\u2019s important to not lose sight of this,\u201d she said. The path can also be winding. \u201cIt\u2019s common for people to feel like they are losing if they don\u2019t win the first, second or third time, but if they are learning and understanding the gaps, it sets them up for bigger wins,\u201d she said. \u201cIt always takes a team, and even if you are a company of one, there are people contributing to you in dynamic ways that are helping you along your journey.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like to remind others that it took a village for us,\u201d Bryant Howroyd said. \u201cWe all contributed to our company\u2019s success, and I\u2019ve got some of the most committed, dedicated, talented and strong people in my organization\u2026\u201d\n\nAsk the right questions and really listen\n\n\u201cWhen you show up, make sure you not only get there on time, but really show up and make an impact,\u201d Bryant Howroyd said. A big part of this involves clear and concise communication. Take extra steps like preparing questions and presentations. In addition, really listen to the answers you receive. \u201cKeep everyone involved in the communication process, and make sure that everyone understands,\u201d she added.\n\nNever compromise who you are\n\nWhen Bryant Howroyd mentors young professionals, which is a major passion of hers. She said she continually reminds them about the importance of staying true to your values. \u201cNever compromise who you are personally to become who you wish to be professionally,\u201d she advised.\n\nView education as a lifelong process\n\n\u201cEducation is freedom,\u201d Bryant Howroyd said, explaining that her education helped her define herself and rise above any racial barriers or other obstacles that stood in her way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also important to recognize that education is a lifelong process,\u201d she said. Continually seek out new opportunities for learning and don\u2019t be afraid to look for new insight in unexpected places. Mentoring others, for example, could broaden your perspective and teach you something new.", "description": "Janice Bryant Howroyd, CEO of ActOne Group and first black woman to build a billion dollar company, givers her best advice to Know Your Value.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_42/3052006/howroyd-2x1_92a1109a3720e40cf6cc165138372657.nbcnews-fp-1200-630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
