(AP) \u2014 Piles of steel sit at one end of the property, waiting to be lifted into place. Workers were going in all directions, some pounding nails into wood, others ready to pour concrete, others driving heavy equipment over piles of dirt.\n\nFor now, it's a construction site.\n\nBefore long, Inter Miami will call it home.\n\n\"Organized chaos,\" Inter Miami sporting director Paul McDonough said as he took a look around the site of the now-demolished Lockhart Stadium where work on a new complex is happening 12 hours a day, seven days a week. \"But we'll be ready.\"\n\nThese are hectic times for McDonough and Inter Miami, the team headlined by soccer icon David Beckham that will embark on its inaugural MLS season starting early in 2020. The team doesn't have a coach yet. Or players. Or a schedule. Or even the first blade of grass for its new field.\n\nOver the next few weeks, all those issues \u2014 and countless others \u2014 will be addressed. Construction is on schedule, with all signals pointing toward everything being ready for the team's first home match that's likely to come in March.\n\nStill, that doesn't do much to help McDonough's sleep cycle.\n\n\"This takes up a ton of time and everything keeps me up at night,\" McDonough said. \"But it's OK. We're just on an accelerated timeline. There's so much stuff going on. But this is expansion. It's awesome. Everything we're doing here, we're trying to do it right.\"\n\nAt any given time, there are about 225 workers on the job site \u2014 the whereabouts of all of them tracked with an app that gets data from a chip attached to the back of their hard hats. If there's lightning in the area, work gets halted for 30 minutes until the cell passes. And that's a big deal, because even with next season still months away every minute counts.\n\nNothing is ready, yet \u2014 but it will be.\n\n\"The way it was built out, we're thinking of the athlete first from the minute they walk in,\" said Jacklyne Ramos, the team's vice president of communications as she stood inside what will be the building containing the locker room and other key spaces for the team. \"The main stadium, that's for the games. Where we are now, this is where they'll live.\"\n\nThe Associated Press got a tour on Monday of what will be Inter Miami's inaugural home. The shell of the team's headquarters \u2014 locker rooms, equipment room, dining area, coach's office, what will become the sports performance lab, the academy workout facilities and more \u2014 is coming together. Every detail has been thought of; the walk from the players' parking lot to the building will be short, the training room will be small (\"I don't want them comfortable in there,\" McDonough said), and an area will be built just off the outside wall of the locker room to air out cleats after training sessions.\n\n\"They'll never be in the building,\" McDonough said. \"Boots can stink.\"\n\nBeckham spent about five years trying to get MLS back in South Florida, and after many sites were considered \u2014 there's still plans for the team to eventually play in another stadium that Beckham and his partner Jorge Mas want built in Miami \u2014 they settled on the former Lockhart site. Lockhart is where the MLS' Miami Fusion played from 1998-2001, eventually folding because of poor attendance.\n\nInter Miami plans to play in Fort Lauderdale until the Miami stadium is complete, but what they're building at the Lockhart site is permanent; the training complex will remain the facility for Inter Miami's MLS, USL League One and academy teams.\n\nThe centerpiece of everything is the 18,000-seat stadium, and parts of what will become the field are already largely marked off. Drainage was installed first, followed by four inches of rock for a base. From there, sprinklers go into place and four thin pieces of wood are set in place to mark where the goalposts will go. About a foot of soil will be added in the coming weeks, watered and compacted and graded. Sod is scheduled to go in Nov. 14; from there, it'll be protected and fenced off and finally, what now seems like an oversized sand pit right now will look like a place to play soccer.\n\nBehind that are more fields, including a turf one that can be used for high school football and other events. The other half-dozen grass fields will be for training and the team's affiliate clubs.\n\nA coach will be hired soon. A roster is coming. There are plans for a soft opening a few weeks before the season and then, when the first match is played, all the mess and chaos will be forgotten.\n\n\"I wasn't ready for this. I'm still not,\" McDonough said. \"I'm learning as we go. Conduits, positioning of poles, there's so many things that you don't realize until you live it. But that's what it takes and we're getting it done.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
