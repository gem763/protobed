All of which don\u2019t add up to a great night\u2019s sleep. Whichever trimester you are in, you might notice you are tossing and turning more than ever, which is where a pregnancy pillow might help.\n\n\u201cThere are a number of features of pregnancy that can disturb sleep; including hormonal shifts, nausea, frequent urination, anxiety and of course the physical limitations experienced at various stages of pregnancy,\u201d explains Lauren Peacock, sleep specialist and founder of Little Sleep Stars consultancy.\n\n\u201cSome mothers-to-be find a pregnancy pillow helps to ease physical aches and pains while lying down. As an example, placing a pillow between the legs when side sleeping may help lower back pain. Pregnant women are advised to sleep on their left side (to maximise blood flow to the placenta) so a pregnancy pillow can also be a useful positional aid, \u201c she adds.\n\nIt might take a little research to find the right pillow for you, since some women love the feeling of being cocooned by oversized full-body pillows, while others prefer to just target specific areas with a smaller V-shaped one.\n\nAnother consideration is whether you plan to breastfeed, since many pregnancy pillows can double up as a nursing pillow when your little one arrives. Factoring in things like material type, firmness, pressure and, of course, price is worthwhile too. We recruited a team of new mums to test out a variety of pregnancy pillows to cover every eventuality. Here are our favourites.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

The long microbean cushion helps to support your bump and legs when used lengthways and the neck and shoulders when in a V-shape, and also converts into a snug baby pod that can handily be used from birth up until your little one starts rolling. Our tester, who was sixteen weeks pregnant with twins, found this pillow was just the right size for her growing bump and loved how she could easily alter the firmness by changing the arrangement of beads (more beads equals a firmer pillow, while separating them made it softer).\n\nBuy now\n\nMum & b maternity pillow fresh: \u00a337.99, Babymoov\n\nThis super simple ergonomically designed pillow is the smallest we tried, its peanut shape works best if you have a specific area you want to target, such as using in between the legs for pelvic pain or propping up swollen feet after a long day at work. The pillow is double sided and made of bamboo viscose \u2013 an antibacterial and breathable material \u2013 which made this one feel extra soft. This is also useful once your baby arrives as it\u2019s great to have on hand to support your little one\u2019s head when feeding and even to use as a tummy time pillow too. Rather than for sleeping, we think this pillow is best for using on the go or for focusing on specific areas during the daytime.\n\nBuy now\n\nSilentnight body support pillow: \u00a338, Argos\n\nThis simple body support pillow isn\u2019t designed specifically for pregnancy but is great for supporting multiple pressure points. We loved it for cradling our bump, solving leg cramps and soothing a bad back. Our tester noted this was on the firmer side of things; so it\u2019s great if you\u2019re on the hunt for a pregnancy pillow that offers plenty of pressure and isn\u2019t too soft. Its size spans the length of the body so it\u2019s best suited for those who have plenty of space. A great all-rounder.\n\nBuy now\n\nBbhugme pregnancy pillow: From \u00a3128, bbhugme\n\nBbhugme is known for creating pregnancy pillows that manage to combine both style and comfort. Available in five different colourways, this luxe pregnancy pillow really feels like heaven to touch, our body simply melted into the silky cover and bean bag style design. Interior conscious parents won\u2019t be able to resist the green leaf and marble prints, which will jazz up your bedroom no end.\n\nIt\u2019s seriously squishy, so if you aren\u2019t a fan of ultra-firm pillows and want something that feels like it moulds to you as you toss and turn then we definitely recommend this. Unlike most on the market, the design means you can adjust it to fit your shape and sleeping position throughout the night. The cover is really easy to slip off, wash and interchange should you want to buy a few different styles. Once the baby arrives, it comes in handy for supporting with feeding and even with learning to sit, since you can also tie the ends together to form a doughnut-type shape as well as using this lengthways.\n\nBuy now\n\nDreamgenii pregnancy support and feeding pillow: \u00a344.99, Mothercare\n\nThis pillow comes with the impressive accolade of being recommended by midwives, but does it live up to the high praise? Our 28 weeks pregnant tester certainly felt so. She loved that it was small enough not to take over the bed but firm enough to offer support in all the right places.\n\nShe noted that the padding is supportive without feeling in any way restrictive; meaning the support is perfect around the bump area. This also did a great job of stopping her rolling over onto her back. The 100 per cent cotton cover is breathable so it is perfect for avoiding overheating, while the pillowcase can easily be washed and replaced with covers in a range of colours.\n\nBuy now\n\nSlumberdown V-shaped pillow 2 pack: \u00a321.09, Amazon\n\nThis compact V-shaped pillow is an affordable alternative to more expensive pillows on the market, yet it still delivers on comfort and support. The shape and soft pressure of the hollow-fibre filling works well to support your bump, back, and legs. Our tester said this non-allergenic pillow was particularly soft and comfortable to lie on and also did a good job of stopping her sleeping on her back during the night.\n\nBuy now\n\nBellamoon full moon 7-in-1 pregnancy pillow: \u00a3169, Bellamoon\n\nFor mum\u2019s who plan on breastfeeding, this is an investment that will prove its value time and time again. It comes in separate parts that cleverly zip together to provide a variety of different options. First up is the pregnancy pillow which can be used in several ways. You can use one piece of the pillow separately around your bump or between your knees and then zip together to form a longer pregnancy pillow to cover much of your body when you need more support.\n\nOnce your baby arrives, the true functionality of this one comes into play. We particularly like how this converts into a full moon daybed. Using this when breastfeeding allows your head and back to be supported and the square side is great for your baby to lie on.\n\nEven if you\u2019re not breastfeeding, we think it\u2019s ideal for mum and baby bonding, especially if you\u2019ve had a c-section and are struggling to carry your baby. Other functions include a pillow for tummy time, a breastfeeding cover and a smaller half-moon breastfeeding pod. It\u2019s pricey but is such a clever product that will last throughout your pregnancy and beyond.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Pregnancy pillows\n\nWe loved the microbean pillow from Jo Jo Maman Bebe which delivered on comfort, price and practicality \u2013 with the pod conversion being a lovely touch. For those who are planning to breastfeed, it\u2019s well worth investing in the multi-functional Bellamoon, which offers maximum comfort for you and your baby. The V-shaped pillow by Slumberdown is also a great budget buy.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
