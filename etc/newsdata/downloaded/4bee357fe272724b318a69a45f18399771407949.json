(Anna Moneymaker/The New York Times)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A White House official who listened to President Donald Trump\u2019s July phone call with Ukraine\u2019s leader described it as \u201ccrazy,\u201d \u201cfrightening\u201d and \u201ccompletely lacking in substance related to national security,\u201d according to a memo written by the whistleblower at the center of the Ukraine scandal, a CIA officer who spoke to the White House official.\n\nThe official was \u201cvisibly shaken by what had transpired,\u201d the CIA officer wrote in his memo, one day after Trump pressured President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine in a July 25 phone call to open investigations that would benefit him politically.\n\nA palpable sense of concern had already taken hold among at least some in the White House that the call had veered well outside the bounds of traditional diplomacy, the officer wrote.\n\n\u201cThe official stated that there was already a conversation underway with White House lawyers about how to handle the discussion because, in the official\u2019s view, the president had clearly committed a criminal act by urging a foreign power to investigate a U.S. person for the purposes of advancing his own reelection bid in 2020,\u201d the CIA officer wrote.\n\nThe document provides a rare glimpse into at least one of the communications with a White House official that helped prompt the whistleblower\u2019s formal complaint to the intelligence community inspector general detailing a broad pressure campaign on Ukraine by Trump, administration officials and his personal lawyer.\n\nThe complaint and a reconstructed transcript released by the White House formed the basis of the House impeachment inquiry into Trump.\n\nThe inspector general, Michael Atkinson, handed the two-page memo over to Congress last week with other documents that shed light on the whistleblower and his actions. A person familiar with their contents, which Fox News first reported, described them to The New York Times. A lawyer for the whistleblower did not comment.\n\nThe whistleblower, who relied on \u201cmultiple U.S. government officials\u201d for his complaint, said that Trump was \u201cusing the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.\u201d\n\nIt was not clear whether the White House official he spoke to July 26 was the second whistleblower, who has also provided information to Atkinson, or a different person. Neither whistleblower\u2019s name has been made public.\n\nLittle, if any, of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint has been disproved, though Trump has sought to discredit him. The White House transcript largely affirmed his account of the call, and Atkinson deemed his complaint credible, saying he interviewed others who corroborated it.\n\nThe White House official \u201cseemed keen to inform a trusted colleague within the national security apparatus about the call,\u201d the CIA officer wrote in his July 26 memo.\n\nMuch of the whistleblower\u2019s memo also comports with the existing public record of the call between Trump and Zelenskiy. The CIA officer noted that he spoke to the White House official for only a few minutes, \u201cand as a result, I only received highlights.\u201d\n\nThe memo detailed key aspects of the conversation, including Trump\u2019s request for investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, and a conspiracy theory about Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 election.\n\nAtkinson shared the memo and the other documents with the House Intelligence Committee last week before a session in which he privately described the steps he took to assess the credibility of the complaint.\n\nIn submitting his complaint, the whistleblower identified three facts that could be used to accuse him of potential bias against Trump, the documents showed. Two were redacted. The third indicated that the whistleblower is a registered Democrat, a fact first reported by CNN last week that has widely circulated since.\n\nResponding to that reporting on Twitter, Mark S. Zaid, a lawyer for the whistleblower, brushed off the idea that party registration proved anything about his client\u2019s credibility.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t comment on identifying info but if true, give me a break! Bias? Seriously?\u201d he wrote.\n\nStill, the whistleblower\u2019s political affiliation and the other facts, should they become public, could fuel arguments from Trump and his Republican allies that his actions were politically motivated or that his political views colored how he assessed a string of actions he heard about from other government officials and then summarized in his complaint.", "description": "WASHINGTON -- A White House official who listened to President Donald Trump's July phone call with Ukraine's leader described it as \"crazy,\" \"frightening\" and \"completely lacking in substance related to national security,\" according to a memo written by the whistleblower", "authors": ["Nicholas Fandos"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/HAvbrq0jIQVShiu6Zjt42Q--~B/aD0zNDczO3c9NTIxMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/d2e01d83d660f7d75d2151d9c72f1b75", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
