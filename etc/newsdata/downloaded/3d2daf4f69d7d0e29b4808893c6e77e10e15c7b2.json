The trade surplus rose to 20.2 billion euros ($22.27 billion) after a downwardly revised 18.0 billion euros in the prior month.\n\nA Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a 0.5% drop in exports and a 0.3% fall in imports. The trade surplus was expected to come in at 17.5 billion euros.\n\n\"This morning's trade data brings a very weak ray of sunshine. Nothing more but luckily also nothing less,\" said Carsten Brzeski, economist at ING.\n\nThe stronger-than-expected export figures cut against the grain of a recent run of weak data from Germany, which has fuelled concerns that the economy could tip into recession in the July-September period.\n\nAgainst that bleak backdrop, the European Central Bank is expected to deploy fresh stimulus at its policy meeting on Thursday.\n\nGermany's gross domestic product contracted by 0.1% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter on weaker exports, with the decrease in foreign sales mainly driven by Britain and below-average demand from China.\n\nEconomists generally define a technical recession as at least two consecutive quarters of contraction.\n\nMonday's data showed that in the January-July period, German exports rose by 1.0%, with the strongest contribution coming from markets beyond the European Union, which registered growth of 2.9%.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said on a visit to Beijing on Friday that the China-U.S. trade war affects the whole world and that she hopes it will be resolved soon.\n\n\n\n", "description": "The Federal Statistics Office said seasonally adjusted exports rose 0.7% on the month while imports fell 1.5%.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/101979078-475371607.jpg?v=1532564425", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
