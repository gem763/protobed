The unemployment rate sunk to a 50-year low of 3.5 percent last month, even as the economy added 136,000 jobs, fewer than expected.\n\n\u201cEurope is not doing well. Asia is doing poorly, to put it mildly, and we continue to do very well,\u201d Trump told reporters Friday. \u201cWe\u2019re the miracle.\u201d\n\nBut with just more than a year until the 2020 election, Trump faces a narrowing window to clinch long-promised victories over China and the EU in trade talks. The president also risks political damage if he fails to accomplish key pillars of his economic agenda or triggers a recession in the process.\n\nAnd the president's political woes could also affect the economy if the impeachment fight rattles markets or closes the door on Congress approving the new NAFTA deal.\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s bluster, the September report, along with a month of dismal data, made clear the risks the president faces if he further escalates trade tensions.\n\nJob growth in manufacturing and other trade sensitive sectors has flatlined throughout 2019 as important gauges of U.S. industrial activity showed a grueling retraction. A summer of rising trade tensions and recession warnings have also taken a toll on consumer confidence and spending, which have slipped in recent months.\n\n\u201cWhat we've seen is a slowdown, but not a collapse so far. So, there is a chill in the air, but it's not frozen yet,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.\n\n\u201cIf we don't lift this cloud of trade uncertainty and we compound it with additional tariffs,\u201d Swonk added, \u201cthat's going to have more of a snowball effect.\u201d\n\nTrump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have carefully laid the groundwork for a breakthrough next week after several failed attempts to end the costly U.S.-China trade war. After tensions spiked in August, both nations moved to delay pending tariffs and extended goodwill gestures in a bid to revive progress on a deal.\n\nWhether the U.S. and China can extend this progress turns on the outcome of Chinese Vice Premier Liu He\u2019s visit to Washington next week, said James Lucier, managing partner at Capital Alpha Partners, a Washington policy advisory firm.\n\n\u201cLiu He needs to come on Thursday next week with a deal on the table to mean that we can get something done between Trump and Xi by the end of the year,\u201d Lucier said of China\u2019s top trade negotiator.\n\n\u201cSo it is make or break, frankly. It doesn't need to be completely done, but Liu needs to make it look credible.\u201d\n\nTrump has repeatedly said that he will not accept anything short of a major expansion in Chinese purchases of U.S. crops, increased U.S. access to Chinese financial markets and greater protections for U.S. intellectual property and technology.\n\nIf Liu fails to appease Trump, tariffs on more than $250 billion in Chinese imports are set to rise to 30 percent from 25 percent on Oct. 15. Another tranche of 10 percent tariffs on more than $125 billion in Chinese products are also set to kick in on Dec. 15, targeting hundreds of crucial consumer goods.\n\nEven so, most observers say Trump will likely be forced to settle for a narrow agreement focused on agricultural purchases, tariff relief and nonbinding agreements on structural issues.\n\n\u201cThe only thing that would be possible at this point is a mini deal,\u201d Lucier said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI think an enforceable commitment in Chinese law, public for all the world to see, is more or less off the table at this point.\u201d\n\nAs Trump and China look to bring their trade tensions to a simmer, the president\u2019s conflict with the EU threatens to reach a boiling point. The U.S. and EU are set to meet on Oct. 14, a day before the Chinese tariff hike kicks in, to settle a 15-year dispute over aerospace subsidies.\n\nTrump is set to impose tariffs on Oct. 18 on crucial European exports after a World Trade Organization (WTO) arbitrator issued a ruling Wednesday allowing the U.S. to impose tariffs on up to $7.5 billion in European goods. The president is set to levy 25-percent tariffs on certain European Union agricultural exports and 10-percent tariffs on some European-brand aircraft and parts.\n\nThe decision is meant to resolve a 2004 case filed by the U.S. alleging improper EU subsidies to Airbus, the continent\u2019s top aerospace company. But the White House has exempted major aircraft parts from the tariffs to buffer U.S. airliners and Airbus\u2019 U.S.-based plants from harm.\n\nInstead, the White House targeted an array of iconic European food, wine and liquor exports with steep tariffs, risking blowback from an EU fiercely protective of agriculture products.\n\n\"They intentionally try to put on the list things that will get attention,\u201d said Jessica Wasserman, a partner at law firm Greenspoon Marder who represents clients subject to Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\n\u201cThere's nothing sinister about it,\" Wasserman added, calling it \"a good negotiating tactic to get a resolution.\"\n\nWasserman also warned that the situation could escalate. It Trump's tariffs prompt retaliation from the EU, the president may counter with 25-percent tariffs on foreign autos that could be devastating to Europe.\n\n\"It'll tempt him to get mad and do something on the autos, and I think they're going to settle down and stop doing that,\u201d Wasserman said, noting it was \u201csurprising\u201d that the U.S. did not simply amp up tariffs on aircraft instead.\n\nIt's the \"chaos-as-a-negotiating tactic that Trump loves,\u201d she added.\n\nWhile consumers have largely been insulated from the direct effects of rising tariffs, the persistent trade tensions and headlines about the slowing economy pose their own risks.\n\n\u201cPeople just don't know where to place their bets. They don't know whether the road ahead is paved, let alone how far they can move forward,\u201d Swonk said.\n\n\u201cThere's the direct cost of tariffs and the retaliation, those alone are not enough to push you into recession,\" Swonk continued. \"But it's a snowballing effect, and it's that confidence factor that really does get you into a place where you get on thin ice.\u201d\n\n//", "description": "President Trump is facing a crucial stretch for his trade agenda and reelection prospects amid heightened concerns about the U.S. economy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonaldtwo_10042019getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
