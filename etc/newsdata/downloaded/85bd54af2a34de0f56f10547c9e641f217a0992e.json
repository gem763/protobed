Matt Bevin said on Thursday the NCAA should pay student athletes in order to avoid the corruption scandals that have plagued college basketball and football in recent years.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nBevin told TMZ Sports that he \u201cfirmly\u201d believes athletes at the biggest schools should be paid, adding that it is \u201cridiculous\u201d to say that student athletes are not lower-tier professionals. Bevin\u2019s comments came as several top college athletics programs, including the University of Louisville and its former basketball coach Rick Pitino, were ensnared by allegations of bribery and corruption.\n\n\u201cIf you want to cut down on the amount of scandals that involves these kids, their parents, these shady agents and these squirrely deals, the key to do that is to come up with a structure whereby a kid who is a talent, who truly is capable of making it to the pros\u2026can be paid to actually be the professional athlete he is, and then allow that person to have that money deferred,\u201d Bevin said.\n\nFederal documents revealed last month that more than two dozen current and former athletes and their families received benefits that violated National Collegiate Athletic Association rules, including cash payments. Yahoo Sports was first to report details of the federal investigation. The documents linked top programs including Duke, North Carolina and Michigan State to the investigation.\n\nFederal officials arrested 10 individuals, including four NCAA assistant basketball coaches, on charges of using bribes and other incentives to influence college athletes improperly. The University Louisville ousted its legendary head coach, Pitino, after the school was named in court documents related to the arrests. The NCAA also forced Louisville to vacate its 2013 men\u2019s college basketball championship.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a multi-billion industry and we\u2019re just pretending these kids are student-athletes?\u201d Bevin said.", "description": "It\u2019s \u201cridiculous\u201d to say that student athletes are not lower-tier professionals, Matt Bevin said.", "authors": ["Thomas Barrabi"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/03/0/0/NCAA-logo.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2018-03-02"}
