REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes\n\nPARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron has spoken to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, an official in Macron\u2019s office said on Tuesday, as a deadline looms to reach a Brexit deal.\n\nMacron\u2019s official said that while Johnson was right to acknowledge in the call the positive momentum toward getting a Brexit deal done, it remained unclear if a deal could be reached in time for this week\u2019s European summit.\n\nThe EU\u2019s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said earlier on Tuesday that reaching a divorce deal between Britain and the European Union was still possible this week, even if it was getting more and more difficult.\n\n\u201cThe possibility of a deal is clear, everyone recognizes that. What counts is what the negotiator Michel Barnier said, namely that a possibility of a deal is still not the same as having a deal,\u201d added Macron\u2019s official.", "description": "French President Emmanuel Macron has spoken to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, an official in Macron's office said on Tuesday, as a deadline looms to reach a Brexit deal.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441080880&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E0RR", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
