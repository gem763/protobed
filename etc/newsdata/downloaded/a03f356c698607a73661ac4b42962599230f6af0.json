Biden, whose son Hunter worked for a company drilling for gas in Ukraine, said on Saturday he had never spoken to his son about his business dealings in Ukraine.\n\nZelenskiy\u2019s meeting this week with Trump, during a trip to the United States for the U.N. General Assembly, will be his first with the U.S. president since Zelenskiy became Ukraine\u2019s leader in May.\n\n\u201cI think we will have a meaningful, substantive meeting,\u201d Zelenskiy was quoted as saying. His office gave no other details.\n\nA comedian and, like Trump, a television star with no prior political experience when he took office, Zelenskiy won a landslide election victory in April promising voters an end to the conflict with Russian-backed forces in east Ukraine.\n\nBALANCING ACT\n\nZelenskiy cannot risk relations with either side of the political divide in Washington, whose bipartisan support Ukraine counts on for aid and diplomatic cover against Russia following Moscow\u2019s annexation of the Crimea peninsula in 2014.\n\nUkraine also wants Moscow to hand Crimea back, a demand that has fallen on deaf ears in Russia.\n\n\u201cIt is very important to make friends with Trump, to be liked by Trump, but not to get drawn into this inter-party conflict,\u201d said Volodymyr Fesenko, an analyst with Kiev-based think tank Penta.\n\nZelenskiy also said he hoped the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany would meet in the next few weeks to discuss the five-year-old conflict in east Ukraine that has killed 13,000 people.\n\n\u201cWe want to leave this meeting with certain results on specific terms of ending the war and returning our territories,\u201d Zelenskiy said.\n\nHe hopes to build on the momentum gained when Russia and Ukraine swapped dozens of prisoners this month in a landmark exchange that brought Western praise and hopes for a thaw in relations.", "description": "Ukraine's president said he expects a \"meaningful, substantive\" meeting with Donald Trump this week and, hoping there will soon be new peace talks on east Ukraine, reiterated Kiev's need for U.S. support.", "authors": ["Matthias Williams", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433318934&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N0Z1", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
