Chen delivers a schmoozy love ballad that sounds more like karaoke. Despite this major misstep, the singer manages to get back on track by returning to the lush style and arrangements of his debut.\n\nTWICE's Feel Special EP review: K-pop girl group mix EDM, hip hop and 90s vibes and make it work\n\nAs with that record, the songs here are soft and comforting, with the only real difference being Chen\u2019s focus on acoustic guitar, pushing the piano parts to the background. Amaranth portrays the EXO member\u2019s wistfulness over slow jazz chords, capturing the essence of the album artwork perfectly. Hold You Tight has an acoustic-pop vibe, while You Never Know offers the first real singalong with its \u201cLa-la-la\u201d section.\n\nGood Night is the most ambitious track, with rising strings and child choirs echoing beautifully around Chen\u2019s lullaby refrain, \u201cSleep well/On this night I wish for you to have good dreams,\u201d which is enough to make anyone swoon.\n\nVideo of CHEN \uccb8 '\uc6b0\ub9ac \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ud560\uae4c\uc694 (Shall we?)'
