Whichever approach you take, there\u2019s a multi-billion dollar market chock-full of lotions and potions trying to sell us the fountain of youth. Even the supplement industry has joined this charge. Anti-aging supplements are gaining popularity. While some may seem too good to be true, others may actually give you a fighting chance against the less desirable effects of aging.\n\nThe Underlying Causes of Aging\n\nIt\u2019s widely recognized today that most, if not all, health threats arise due to inflammation. This constant onslaught of environmental and lifestyle threats\u2014pollution, physical and mental stress, poor diet, unhealthy habits\u2014causes whole-body inflammation. This response is common after a lifetime of wear and tear, and it results in aches, pains, wrinkles, higher disease risk, and other signs that we typically associate with aging. Fortunately, there\u2019s a simple, easy way to tell if chronic inflammation is threatening your health. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a substance produced by your liver to combat inflammation. High levels of CRP in the bloodstream are associated with a variety of bad news illnesses, including cancer, diabetes, arthritis, and heart disease. The good news is that your CRP level is easy to check. A simple blood test\u2014you don\u2019t even have to fast the night before\u2014and you get your score. A CRP score below 1 means you\u2019re inflammation-free. But scores even a fraction of a point above 1 signal trouble. If CRP remains elevated for months at a time, that\u2019s the very definition of chronic inflammation producing a serious fire, in the form of heart disease, cancer, or something just as troubling. And there\u2019s another cause of aging that is just now starting to be understood. Research is starting to show that your biological age (as opposed to your chronological age) is strongly determined by the length of your\n\nCurcumin\n\ntelomeres . Telomeres are protective caps on the ends of the chromosomes inside each and every cell. They keep the chromosomes\u2019 ends from getting damaged when the cells divide. At birth, telomeres are nice and long. But over time, every time a cell divides, a section of telomere breaks off, making it a little shorter. This is perfectly normal\u2026but when telomeres shorten too much, the cell either dies before its time or mutates. This results in premature aging and higher risk of disease. So, if your goal is to slow down the hands of time through the use of anti-aging supplements, you should focus on reducing inflammation and protecting your telomeres. Here are the supplements that can help you do just that.If you\u2019ve ever enjoyed an Indian or yellow curry you\u2019ve ingested a good dose of the spice turmeric. This beautiful golden spice is the gracious source of the supplement curcumin \u2014the ultimate anti-aging supplement. It\u2019s been used medicinally for centuries. Today\u2019s science has proven why. Thousands of studies on curcumin echo the findings of a report in the journal Advanced Experimental Medical Biology, which says: \u201cCurcumin has been shown to exhibit antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer activities and thus has the potential against various malignant diseases, diabetes, allergies, arthritis, Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other chronic illnesses.\u201d Curcumin is known for its outstanding ability to reduce inflammation. Here are just a few of the studies that have shown this:\n\nIn one study, one month of curcumin supplements significantly reduced C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation. This study used curcumin with enhanced absorption, meaning it\u2019s combined with another substance to help your body use it to its fullest strength. That\u2019s an important feature you should look for when purchasing a curcumin supplement.\n\nAnother study concluded that a daily dose of 2,000 mg of curcumin was as effective as 800 mg of ibuprofen for relieving pain and inflammation in patients with knee osteoarthritis.\n\nOmega-3 Fatty Acids\n\nCurcumin has even been found effective at reducing inflammation in cancer patients, as well as in individuals exposed to high levels of air pollution. All up, nearly everywhere it\u2019s been studied, curcumin has performed as well as, or better than, Big Pharma\u2019s and Big Cosmetics\u2019 top sellers\u2014at a fraction of the price. It\u2019s truly an ideal anti-aging supplement. The recommended dose is 1,500 mg per day.It\u2019s been shown time and again that a diet high in the omega-3 essential fatty acids (EFAs), EPA and DHA, can help dramatically reduce inflammation . EFAs can also help boost healthy HDL\u2014\u201cgood\u201d cholesterol\u2014while lowering dangerous triglycerides. In addition, they can help lower blood pressure. They\u2019re even helpful for promoting strong, healthy, young-looking hair, skin, and nails. Bonus? Omega-3s have been shown to help balance mood, boost cognitive function, and improve overall brain health. And why not? Looking that good makes you feel great. Omega-3 EFAs are called essential because we need them to survive, yet the body can\u2019t produce them. They must come from diet. Unfortunately, depending on your diet, getting adequate EFAs these days is kind of sketchy. They\u2019re abundant in cold water fish like salmon, tuna, halibut, sardines, herring, and mackerel, and in certain types of algae, flax seeds, pumpkin seeds, and walnuts (for their healthy oils). But considering the state of the world\u2019s polluted waters, the safer option is to take it in supplement form. To get the most from omega-3s, take 1,250-1,500 mg of EPA and DHA daily.\n\nVitamin D\n\nResearch on the benefits of vitamin D continues to mount, with studies showing it can reduce the risk of osteoporosis, high blood pressure, neurodegenerative diseases, various forms of cancer, diabetes, and the list goes on. As of late, research has even shown that vitamin D has protective effects on telomeres. In one study, researchers wanted to see how vitamin D supplementation affected telomere length in patients on kidney dialysis. Naturally these people would have shorter-than-normal telomeres. However, those taking vitamin D had greater telomere length compared to those who were not. In another study of 2,160 women, blood levels of vitamin D were positively associated with longer telomere length, regardless of factors such as age, menopausal status, use of hormones, and physical activity. Vitamin D deficiency is extremely common \u2014so much so that many doctors now check vitamin D status with routine blood tests. Adequate levels range from 40-80 ng/ml, and adults should take about 5,000 IU per day to reach and maintain that level. If you take a supplement, be sure to choose D3, the form your body can absorb and use most efficiently. Of course, the cheapest and most reliable way to get your daily dose of D is through sunlight. Vitamin D is known as \u201cthe sunshine vitamin\u201d because your body produces it in response to exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Going outside for 10-20 minutes in the midday sun without\n\nOther Anti-Aging Supplements\n\nReferences\n\nAggarwal BB1, Sundaram C, Malani N, Ichikawa H. \u201cCurcumin: the Indian solid gold.\u201d Adv Exp Med Biol. 2007;595:1-75.\n\nsunscreen can create up to 10,000 IU of vitamin D!

Start with those three, and if you want to add other anti-inflammatory, telomere-supportive nutrients to the mix, try vitamin B12 CoQ10 , and polyphenols such as resveratrol and green or black tea. While, unfortunately, nothing can stop us from getting older, we can look\u2014and more importantly, feel\u2014younger and more energetic by adding these anti-aging supplements to our daily routines.", "description": "Table of Contents\r\n\r\n \tCauses of Aging\r\n \tAnti-aging supplements\r\n\r\n \tCurcumin\r\n \tOmega-3 .09/02/2019 3:04:15AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png"}
