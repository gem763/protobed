However, in 1926, he set his sights on composing a full-length opera after reading DuBose Heyward\u2019s novel \u201cPorgy,\u201d published the previous year.\n\nHeyward, descended from a signer of the Declaration of Independence, suffered youthful penury and worked for a time on the Charleston, S.C., docks alongside many African-Americans. Partly inspired by his observations, \u201cPorgy\u201d presents a dichotomy between the elegant, flowing prose of the sympathetic narrative voice and the heavy Gullah dialect of the protagonists.\n\nDespite his enthusiasm, Gershwin had to set aside his operatic plan during the successful Broadway run of \u201cPorgy,\u201d dramatized by Heyward and his wife, Dorothy. In 1933, Heyward and Gershwin finally embarked on their collaboration, during which Gershwin traveled to South Carolina to absorb the local culture. Heyward wrote the lyrics of many of the songs, including \u201cSummertime,\u201d \u201cA Woman Is a Sometime Thing\u201d and \u201cMy Man\u2019s Gone Now\u201d; Gershwin\u2019s brother Ira wrote the lyrics for \u201cIt Ain\u2019t Necessarily So\u201d and \u201cThere\u2019s a Boat Dat\u2019s Leavin\u2019 Soon for New York.\u201d Both authors shared credit for \u201cI Got Plenty o\u2019 Nuttin\u2019\u201d and \u201cBess, You Is My Woman Now.\u201d\n\nIntensely proud of his opera, Gershwin described it as combining \u201cthe drama and romance of \u2018Carmen\u2019 with the beauty of \u2018Die Meistersinger.\u2019\u201d However, he took particular pride in the complex passages upon which he lavished his hard-won contrapuntal skill, especially the jazz fugue accompanying Porgy\u2019s climactic fight with Bess\u2019s murderous ex-lover, Crown. But after the Boston tryout, Gershwin reluctantly acquiesced to director Rouben Mamoulian \u2019s insistence on deleting much of the operatic connective tissue and musical development. What had its premiere on Broadway on Oct. 10, 1935, misrepresented Gershwin\u2019s overall musical architecture, and received mixed and generally condescending reviews. Nevertheless, the music enjoyed life beyond the opera stage in Gershwin\u2019s own symphonic suite, \u201cCatfish Row\u201d (1936); Robert Russell Bennett \u2019s two concert versions (1942 and 1956); and numberless jazz and pop stylizations of individual songs. Recordings conducted by John de Main and Lorin Maazel (both 1976) restored Gershwin\u2019s complete score and finally established the work\u2019s true operatic status, as did initial productions at the Metropolitan Opera and Glyndebourne during the 1980s.\n\nTo consider \u201cPorgy and Bess\u201d fairly, we have to look beyond the cultural polemics that have dogged it and appreciate the libretto and music on their own terms. Gershwin was a melodist as inspired in his idiom as Puccini and Verdi were in theirs. Moreover, his music unfailingly rises out of the drama\u2019s characters and their situations. From the initial downbeat the score is unforgettable: First the orchestra sweeps upward with its bustling xylophone theme and syncopated wind chords, immediately establishing the energy of the Catfish Row community. The syncopated wind motif is taken over by the \u201cJasbo Brown Blues,\u201d for solo piano and chorus.\n\nThis rhapsodic passage fades into the quiet, gently rocking clarinet motif introducing one of the most ineffably beautiful of all Gershwin songs, \u201cSummertime,\u201d sung not by a lead figure, but by Clara to her baby.\n\nHere Gershwin evokes the sultry atmosphere of Charleston, with a long, elegiac melody that possesses the haunting quality of folk music. Clara later repeats it over the counterpoint of the evening crap game. In Act III, however, after Clara and her husband, Jake, perish in a hurricane, \u201cSummertime\u201d is reprised by Bess, entrusted with Clara\u2019s now-orphaned infant, and the glorious melody assumes the full measure of tragedy.\n\nIn contrast with Heyward\u2019s poetic lyricism, the serpentine tune of \u201cIt Ain\u2019t Necessarily So\u201d springs from Ira Gershwin \u2019s ironic verses to convey devilish impiety mingled with sheer wickedness. A sermon delivered by a flashy dope peddler, it is the spiritual equivalent of \u201cThe Calf of Gold\u201d aria sung by M\u00e9phistoph\u00e9l\u00e8s in Gounod\u2019s \u201cFaust.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the Heywards and Gershwins transform a simple, crippled beggar into a figure of heroic pathos. While Porgy\u2019s \u201cI Got Plenty o\u2019 Nuttin\u2019\u201d descends directly from the jaunty spirit of old banjo songs like Stephen Foster \u2019s \u201cCamptown Races\u201d and captures his joy with his lot in life now that Bess is in it, their duet, \u201cBess, You Is My Woman Now,\u201d features the soaring, wide melodic intervals characteristic of the greatest operatic love music, riding upon rich, blues-tinged, chromatic harmony.\n\nGershwin\u2019s resourcefulness at creating large-scale operatic forms shines brilliantly in the towering ensemble scene built around \u201cMy Man\u2019s Gone Now,\u201d with its chain of choral passages, emotive recitative and solos that build a graphic image of grief. Ultimately, Gershwin\u2019s musical genius and Heyward\u2019s intensely human story\u2014with its still-resonant themes of drugs, violence and the indomitable spirit of perseverance\u2014make \u201cPorgy and Bess\u201d one of America\u2019s greatest operatic treasures.\n\n\u2014Mr. Scherer writes about music and the fine arts for the Journal.", "description": "George Gershwin\u2019s compositional brilliance and DuBose Heyward\u2019s deeply affecting narrative combined to turn \u2018Porgy and Bess\u2019 into an iconic American opera.", "authors": ["Barrymore Laurence Scherer"], "top_image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/ED-AY981_MPGers_SOC_20190920125606.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
