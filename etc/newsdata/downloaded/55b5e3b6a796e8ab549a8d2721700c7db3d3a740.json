But that government collapsed last month, to be replaced by a tie-up between the 5Stars and the center-left Democratic Party, bringing the movement that long styled itself as anti-establishment closer to the mainstream.\n\n\u201cThe participation of the 5Stars in the government with Salvini was the ultimate obstacle,\u201d Lamberts said. \u201cThis obstacle has been lifted. We are ready to discuss.\u201d\n\nIn the Parliament, the 5Stars have often been ostracised by mainstream parties and considered Euroskeptic. In previous years, the movement was part of the European Freedom and Direct Democracy group alongside Nigel Farage and his supporters, although some 5Stars members insisted they did not feel at ease with the Brexit champion.\n\nBas Eickhout, a Dutch MEP and vice-chair of the Greens group, said the 5Stars had \"quite a history\" in terms of political alliances. \"It\u2019s not only their choice of government [with the far right], but also the choice of going with Farage last time,\u201d he said.\n\nEickhout said no official talks were under way but \"there are talks in the corridors.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou ask me: Am I happy? That\u2019s not the terminology I would use,\" Eickhout said of the prospect of teaming up with the 5Stars. But he added: \"I am certainly not saying no.\"\n\nEickhout said no official talks were under way but \"there are talks in the corridors.\u201d He said he could see both pros and cons to a tie-up with the Italians.\n\nThe 5Stars are currently not part of any bloc so joining the Greens group would give the movement\u2019s 14 MEPs more influence, more speaking time and access to more financial resources.\n\nWith 74 MEPs, the Greens' group is the fourth largest in the Parliament. It is expected to play a prominent role in the new parliamentary term as the legislature is more fragmented, meaning Green support will be more important in order to pass legislation. European Commission President-elect Ursula von der Leyen has also pledged to make green policies a priority.\n\nFor the Greens, the addition of the 5Stars could help cushion the blow of losing 11 British MEPs if Brexit goes ahead.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to launch a serious discussion, loyal and constructive, with the Greens group\u201d \u2014 5Star party official\n\nOn Friday, 5Star officials said they were open to talking to the Greens.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to launch a serious discussion, loyal and constructive, with the Greens group,\u201d a 5Star party official said. \u201cWe have a lot in common, as demonstrated in the work done during the last legislature and we have indisputable political affinities on various themes : climate defense, renewables, fight against austerity, organic farming.\"\n\nIn 2017, the Parliament's liberal leader Guy Verhofstadt opened the door of his bloc to the 5Stars, but his ALDE group later rejected any alliance with a group they deemed Euroskeptic.\n\nItaly\u2019s center-left former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said last week the 5Stars had also reached out to the new liberal-centrist group, Renew Europe (RE). But both 5Star and RE group officials denied any such move.\n\nKalina Oroschakoff and Jacopo Barigazzi contributed reporting.", "description": "End of coalition with Salvini brings movement closer to mainstream.", "authors": ["Ma\u00efa De La Baume", "Kalina Oroschakoff"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-852206526-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
