(AP) - Former NFL and University of Colorado football player Justin Bannan has been charged with attempted murder and assault following a shooting in Boulder.\n\nThe Daily Camera reports the 40-year-old was arrested Wednesday on suspicion of suspicion of attempted murder, assault with extreme indifference, assault with intent to cause serious bodily injury, and burglary.\n\nBoulder police say the former lineman shot a 36-year-old woman in the arm. She was transported to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.\n\nPolice say the shooting appears random and that Bannan does not have a connection to the victim beyond working in the same building.\n\nAuthorities say Bannan was carrying a bag containing two loaded handguns and a rolled $20 bill that tested positive for cocaine.\n\nBannan\u2019s attorney declined to comment following a hearing.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Daily Camera, http://www.dailycamera.com/\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Former NFL and University of Colorado football player Justin Bannan has been charged with attempted murder and assault following a shooting in Boulder.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
