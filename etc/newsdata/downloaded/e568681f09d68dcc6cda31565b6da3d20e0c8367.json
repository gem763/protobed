But what makes a big game at the college level far better than a big game at the NFL level is, of course, the passion of people in the stadium \u2014 primarily the spectators. The actual level of play is not as good; we all know this. But the sights and sounds \u2014 mostly sounds \u2014 create an experience that the pros cannot replicate.\n\nThe Dash has been lucky enough to see a lot of big games in a lot of places, which provoked a list \u2014 what are the most memorable atmospheres experienced on the job? Here they are, in reverse chronological order:\n\nThe Red Glow (21). When: Saturday night. Where: Sanford Stadium, Athens, Georgia. From erupting at the very sight of the Redcoat Marching Band before the game and onward through three quarters, this was occasionally tepid Georgia at its fiercest and loudest. When fan noise helped cause a whopping seven Notre Dame false starts, the homefield advantage is epically real. But the part everyone will remember was when Georgia\u2019s new lighting system bathed the stadium in an infrared glow between the third and fourth quarter. The sight, combined with the roar, was a sensory bombardment even Hollywood would find impossible to reproduce in an IMAX theater.\n\nGeorgia turns Sanford Stadium red at the beginning of the fourth quarter against Notre Dame in an NCAA college football game Saturday, Sept. 21, 2019, in Athens, Ga. (AP)\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Spot in the Horseshoe (22). When: Nov. 26, 2016. Where: Ohio Stadium, Columbus, Ohio. When Ohio State\u2019s J.T. Barrett was knocked down almost precisely at the line to gain for a first down on fourth-and-1, more than 110,000 people held their breath waiting to find out \u2014 game over and Michigan wins in double overtime, or Ohio State has new life. When the officials spotted the ball and signaled first down, by the barest of margins, the crowd erupted. And when Curtis Samuel scored on the next play to win the game for the Buckeyes, sending them to the College Football Playoff and sending the Wolverines into a wilderness which they still wander, the stadium went unhinged. The shaking of the old edifice when Samuel scored registered on a \u201cFanQuake\u201d seismology device used by university academic types.\n\nLamar vs. Deshaun (23). When: Oct. 1, 2016. Where: Death Valley, Clemson, South Carolina. This is always a rabid home environment, but the noise was absolutely ceaseless for four hours of fireworks between the eventual Heisman Trophy winner (Lamar Jackson) and the eventual runner-up (Deshaun Watson). The fifth-ranked Tigers prevailed 42-36, stopping No. 3 Louisville in the red zone at the end to send the place over the top and put the Tigers on their way to the national championship.\n\nCowbell Cacophony (24). When: Oct. 11, 2014. Where: Scott Stadium, Starkville, Mississippi. In what many considered the biggest Mississippi State home game ever, the No. 3 Bulldogs, led by Dak Prescott, jumped up 21-0 on No. 2 Auburn on the way to the win and the No. 1 ranking the following day. The primary recollection was the oppressive cowbell clanging for hours pregame, then between plays all game. This was absolute torture for the visiting team.\n\nThe Kick Six (25). When: Nov. 30, 2013. Where: Jordan-Hare Stadium, Auburn, Alabama. You know the play: the greatest walkoff in the history of the sport, a 109-yard return of a missed field goal to win the Iron Bowl, win the SEC West, eventually win the SEC championship game and play for the national title. The fact that it derailed a potential Alabama national championship three-peat only added to the mixture. Single most memorable moment: a burley Auburn fan in his 30s or 40s literally skipping like a joyous child and waving pompons in each hand as he exited the stadium.\n\nCamp Randall Loses It (26). When Oct. 16, 2010. Where: Camp Randall Stadium, Madison, Wisconsin. When David Gilreath ran back the opening kickoff 97 yards, it touched off a startling explosion. When the Badgers led 21-10 after three quarters, the \u201cJump Around\u201d interlude was unrestrained. And when Wisconsin won the game it actually got scary \u2014 students flooding the field and actually trapping some of their colleagues against the rail on the first row.\n\nMount Cody\u2019s Block (27). When: Oct. 24, 2009. Where: Bryant-Denny Stadium, Tuscaloosa, Alabama. It is tantalizing to think how the world might be different today if Alabama\u2019s monster nose guard, Terrence Cody, didn\u2019t break through the line and swat down a Tennessee field goal for the win on the final play. For one, it might have derailed the Crimson Tide\u2019s first national championship under Nick Saban. For another, it might have made Lane Kiffin a hero in Knoxville \u2014 and made it harder for him to leave for USC. But Cody did break through, did block the field goal, and the stadium detonation that ensued was palpable.\n\nDevastation in West Virginia (28). When: Dec. 1, 2007. Where: Milan Puskar Stadium, Morgantown, West Virginia. Saddest stadium The Dash has ever witnessed. At the end of the most tumultuous season in college football history, No. 2 West Virginia was on the verge of a berth in the BCS Championship Game and needed only to beat 4-7 rival Pittsburgh. But everything went wrong and Pitt pulled a 13-9 upset, after which the Mountaineer mascot dropped to one knee on the turf and sobbed. He had a lot of tearful company in the stands.\n\nHold That Tiger (29). When: Sept. 26, 2005. Where: Tiger Stadium, Baton Rouge, Louisiana. After the state was devastated by Hurricane Katrina, LSU\u2019s home opener against North Texas was canceled. Its second home game, against Arizona State, was moved to Tempe because Tiger Stadium was being used as an evacuation shelter. And its third home game, against Tennessee, was postponed by Hurricane Rita. Finally, on a Monday night near the end of a tragic month, there would be football in Death Valley. When the Golden Band from Tigerland took the field and hit the first notes of the school fight song, it was an emotionally cathartic moment. Inspired, LSU raced to a 21-0 lead \u2014 but sapped of emotion thereafter, the Tigers wilted and lost in overtime.\n\nTennessee Gets Over on Spurrier (30). When: Sept. 19, 1998. Where: Neyland Stadium, Knoxville, Tennessee. The one place in college football where you feel the press box shake is Kyle Field at Texas A&M. Except for this one night on Rocky Top. When Florida kicker Cooper Collins missed a 32-yard field goal in overtime to suddenly end the game, and suddenly end Tennessee\u2019s five-year losing streak to the Gators, it felt for a split second like there was an earthquake. But the press box did not collapse, allowing a view of Volunteers fans taking down the goal posts and tearing up chunks of turf with their fingers. A Knoxville News-Sentinel story even documented a fan who infiltrated the Tennessee locker room afterward and embraced players and coaches while sobbing with joy.\n\nNo disrespect to other extremely loud venues I have experienced, including but not limited to: Penn State\u2019s Beaver Stadium for a Whiteout night game; Notre Dame Stadium for the 1988 Catholics vs. Convicts game; Autzen Stadium when Chip Kelly had it rolling at Oregon; Vaught-Hemingway Stadium when Ole Miss upset No. 1 Alabama; L.A. Coliseum for a night game during the Pete Carroll Era; Cardinal Stadium for a West Virginia-Louisville Thursday night game in 2005. Honorable mention to the awesome bipartisan atmospheres for Oklahoma-Texas in Dallas and Florida-Georgia in Jacksonville as well, but those aren't quite the same.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Georgia delivered one of the most intense gameday experiences ever on Saturday in the Bulldogs' win over Notre Dame, which got Pat Forde thinking: What are some other all-time atmospheres over the years?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/A9Tfgzu5NzTd.bR_G4Mm7Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2oyf1qoiGVPmGNyar23KaQ--~B/aD0yMTA1O3c9MzE1ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/c7c8e270-de4d-11e9-b7fa-159dd6399ef1", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
