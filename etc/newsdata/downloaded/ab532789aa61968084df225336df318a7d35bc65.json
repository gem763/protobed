A second diplomat confirmed that \u201calmost all open points have been agreed on at negotiator level exception for the VAT.\u201d\n\nHowever, clinching an accord among negotiators has never been the toughest hurdle in the Brexit process \u2014 and clear political obstacles remain. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson personally had not yet signed off on the negotiators' work, diplomats said.\n\nJohnson told his Cabinet earlier in the afternoon that there was \"a chance of securing a good deal,\" his spokesman said, but there are still \"a number of outstanding issues.\"\n\nThe U.K. government appeared to be struggling to win over the support of the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party after a series of meetings in Downing Street. Even if the DUP were to come aboard, it is not clear if Johnson will be able to pull together a majority in the British parliament, although none of the key factions needed to get any agreement through the House of Commons have yet come out against the plan.\n\nWith the EU side at least, the controversial issue of democratic consent for the deal in Northern Ireland appeared to have been resolves, although it was unclear how.\n\nThe outstanding issue on VAT stemmed from a demand by the British side to impose its own levy regime in Northern Ireland \u2014 as part of a complex customs arrangement that would kick in after December 30, 2020 at the end of an envisioned transition period \u2014 provided the two sides have yet to agree a broader free trade deal.\n\nWhile accepting a customs border down the Irish Sea, the proposed deal would keep Northern Ireland within the U.K.'s customs remit when it comes to trade, diplomats say.\n\nLondon \u201cwants Northern Ireland to have a separate VAT regime from that of the rest of the EU despite being in the [EU] Customs Union,\u201d a senior diplomat said.\n\nNegotiations are still continuing and diplomats said they did not expect the talks to collapse over of the VAT issue. For the EU, however, it is a red line.\n\n\u201cI don't think it will collapse because of it,\" another diplomat said, \"but we remain cautious.\u201d\n\nIn addition to securing final agreements on the U.K. side, diplomats cautioned that the draft legal text, which is required in order to present any deal at this week's European Council summit for leaders' approval, was not yet ready.\n\n\u201cThe text of the treaty has not yet been finalized and a number of ambassadors are therefore very concerned that the text will not be available in time for the start of the European Council,\u201d one diplomat said.\n\nThe diplomat cautioned that leaders would likely be reluctant to endorse any agreement that had not yet been vetted by experts in their capitals.\n\nA meeting of the Working Party Article 50, a group of Brexit experts in the Council, was expected to examine the deal at a meeting on Thursday morning.\n\nDiplomats on Wednesday night also reported progress on the Political Declaration, a statement about both sides' intended future relationship which will accompany the legally-binding Withdrawal Agreement. They said London has now accepted some provisions aimed at creating a so-called \"level playing field\" in any future free trade agreement.\n\nSuch provisions were a core component of the Political Declaration agreed by Johnson's predecessor, Theresa May. Johnson's refusal to back the proposals so far raised fears in Brussels and national EU27 capitals that he intends for Britain to become a strong competitor to the EU.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said earlier this week that in this case the EU should be prepared to treat the U.K as a strong competitor.\n\nYet according to two diplomats, the plan includes an ambition to strike a free-trade agreement with zero quotas and zero tariffs but \u201cwith strong references to Paris [climate] agreement, tax provisions, state aid provisions,... and explicit reference to appropriate implementation mechanisms,\u201d one of the diplomats said.\n\nThe second diplomat confirmed the components of the Political Declaration, saying: \u201cIn this way we limit [market] distortion,\" and the risk of \"dumping\" of goods produced to lower and cheaper standards.\n\nA Downing Street official said that while no deal was expected to be struck on Wednesday evening, \u201cnegotiations are continuing this evening on the last few areas where there are clearly hurdles.\u201d While declining to comment on the details of the discussions, the official did not dispute that VAT was a final outstanding issue.\n\nCharlie Cooper contributed reporting.", "description": "Disagreement about value-added tax stands in the way.", "authors": ["Jacopo Barigazzi", "David M.
