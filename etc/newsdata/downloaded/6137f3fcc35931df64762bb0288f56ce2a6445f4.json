(Nasdaq: BLUE) and Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) today announced that they have entered into a research collaboration to jointly develop next-generation in vivo genome editing treatments for genetic diseases, including haemophilia. During the three-year research collaboration, bluebird and Novo Nordisk will focus on identifying a development gene therapy candidate with the ambition of offering people with haemophilia A a lifetime free of factor replacement therapy.\n\nThe research collaboration will utilise bluebird bio\u2019s proprietary mRNA-based megaTAL\u2122 technology that has the potential to provide a highly specific and efficient way to silence, edit or insert genetic components. Aligned with Novo Nordisk\u2019s haemophilia portfolio, the research collaboration will initially focus on correcting FVIII-clotting factor deficiency, with the potential to explore additional therapeutic targets.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to announce our collaboration with bluebird whose demonstrated capabilities in gene therapy will enable the next-generation of innovative products to make a significant impact on patients\u2019 lives,\u201d said Marcus Schindler, senior vice president for Global Drug Discovery at Novo Nordisk. \u201cThis important research collaboration aimed at addressing genetic diseases at the DNA level reflects Novo Nordisk\u2019s enduring commitment and dedication to inventing disease-modifying medicines that can truly change the lives of people living with haemophilia and other genetic diseases.\u201d\n\n\u201cbluebird has made tremendous progress on enabling an in vivo gene editing platform based on our megaTAL technology, including important advances in high-quality mRNA production and purification,\u201d said Philip Gregory, D. Phil., chief scientific officer, bluebird bio. \u201cWe believe this technology has the potential to create a highly differentiated approach to the treatment of many severe genetic diseases. Moreover, we are thrilled to be able to combine this new platform technology with Novo Nordisk\u2019s deep expertise in haemophilia research and therapeutics. We believe this collaboration will move us toward our shared goal of recoding the treatment paradigm and substantially reduce the burden of disease for patients with factor VIII deficiency.\u201d\n\nAbout megaTALs\n\nMegaTALs are a single-chain fusion enzyme that combines the natural DNA cleaving processes of Homing Endonucleases (HEs) with the DNA binding region of transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors. TALs are easily engineered proteins that recognize specific DNA sequences. This protein fusion architecture allows the generation of extremely active and highly specific and compact nucleases that are compatible with all current viral and non-viral cell delivery methods.\n\nAbout haemophilia\n\nThe incidence of haemophilia A is approximately one in 5,000 and of haemophilia B it is approximately one in 25,000 male births respectively1. Over 400,000 males have haemophilia A or B and the disease is severely underdiagnosed in developing countries2. An estimated 304,0003 people live with haemophilia A, which is a result of decreased or defective production of the blood clotting factor VIII. People with haemophilia B, of which there are some 136,0004 have deficiencies in producing clotting factor IX. For people with haemophilia, bleeds often occur in the joints, particularly knees and ankles. Bleeds can also occur in the muscles, soft tissues, gastrointestinal tract or even the brain. Trauma, major surgery, tooth extractions or other minor surgical interventions require medical supervision to manage the associated bleeding. Without treatment, bleeds are painful and can cause lasting damages and lead to impaired mobility.\n\nAbout bluebird bio, Inc.\n\nbluebird bio is pioneering gene therapy with purpose. From our Cambridge, Mass., headquarters, we\u2019re developing gene therapies for severe genetic diseases and cancer, with the goal that people facing potentially fatal conditions with limited treatment options can live their lives fully. Beyond our labs, we\u2019re working to positively disrupt the healthcare system to create access, transparency and education so that gene therapy can become available to all those who can benefit.\n\nbluebird bio is a human company powered by human stories. We\u2019re putting our care and expertise to work across a spectrum of disorders by researching cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy, sickle cell disease, transfusion-dependent \u03b2-thalassemia and multiple myeloma using three gene therapy technologies: gene addition, cell therapy and (megaTAL-enabled) gene editing.\n\nbluebird bio has additional nests in Seattle, Wash.; Durham, N.C.; and Zug, Switzerland.
