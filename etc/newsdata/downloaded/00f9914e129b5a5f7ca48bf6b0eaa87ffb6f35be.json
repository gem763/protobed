She volunteered at a hotline for sexual-assault survivors. \u201cI wanted to let victims have someone who would listen,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t ask for help, so I wasn\u2019t listened to.\u201d Yet the suicide attempts did not cease until 2006, when a friend suggested that Sabag enroll in a specialized self-defense course offered by El HaLev, an Israeli organization founded in 2003 to offer self-defense training to women who have been traumatized by sexual assault, as well as other vulnerable groups. At first, Sabag was dubious. \u201cI said: \u2018Fighting? No way. What do I have to do with fighting?\u2019\u201d\n\nBut in fact, a growing body of research indicates that self-defense training can enable women to cope with the threat of sexual violence by providing a sense of mastery and personal control over their own safety. Within this field, some studies have examined a unique and pressing question: Can therapeutic self-defense training be an effective tool for sexual-assault survivors who experience PTSD and other symptoms of trauma? Though the research is preliminary, some therapists and researchers believe the answer is yes.\n\n\u201cWhile \u2018talk-based\u2019 therapies are undoubtedly helpful, there is a need for additional modalities,\u201d says Gianine Rosenblum, a clinical psychologist based in New Jersey who has collaborated with self-defense instructors to develop a curriculum tailored to female trauma survivors.\n\nResearchers who study self-defense for sexual assault note its similarities to exposure therapy, in which individuals in a safe environment are exposed to the things they fear and avoid. In the case of self-defense training, however, participants are not only exposed to simulated assaults, they also learn and practice proactive responses, including\u2014but not limited to\u2014self-defense maneuvers. Over time, these repeated simulations can massively transform old memories of assault into new memories of empowerment, explains Jim Hopper, a psychologist and teaching associate at Harvard Medical School.\n\nSabag was not familiar with these theories back in 2006; however, she eventually decided to enroll in the self-defense training. Perhaps, she thought, it would help her be less fearful of others.\n\nIn a 2006 video she shared with Undark, Sabag can be seen lying on the floor of a gym at El HaLev. She\u2019s surrounded by roughly a dozen women showering her with encouragement. A large man dressed in a padded suit and a helmet\u2014referred to as \u201cthe mugger\u201d\u2014approaches with heavy footsteps and lies on top of her. The women continue to cheer, encouraging Sabag to kick her assailant. A female trainer leans in, providing instruction. Sabag sends up a few weak kicks, connecting with the mugger. Then she gets up, swaying, and returns to the line of trainees.\n\nDin Aharoni / El HaLev\n\nIn that moment of confrontation, Sabag says she felt disoriented, not sure of where she was. She had been nauseous while waiting her turn, and then when the mugger was finally standing in front of her, she froze. \u201cMy body refused to cooperate, and there was a split. My mind left my body and I was looking at my body from the outside, like in a nightmare,\u201d she says. \u201cWithout this split, I wouldn\u2019t have found the power to react.\u201d", "description": "Evidence suggests that classes can be like therapy for sexual-assault survivors, but some researchers fear that they could cause new trauma instead.", "authors": ["Gitit Ginat"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/El_HaLev_IMPACT_by_din_aharoni_e1568297342325/facebook.jpg?1568816977", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
