What comes next?", "language": "en", "text": "More than a \u201cmassive inconvenience,\u201d as Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) called the shutdown, this unprecedented measure marks a new low in public confidence that could have far-reaching consequences on California and its residents. It\u2019s fueling anger, distrust and bitterness from Californians already struggling to meet basic needs in the midst of an affordable housing crisis, staggering gas prices and increasing precarity in gig economy jobs that offer barely a living wage. We are supposed to be the state that represents America\u2019s bright future. But what happens when that future goes dark?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLike many Californians, I am suspended between two parallel worlds: that of my overflowing email inbox where life and work mostly proceed as usual at the university where I work in San Francisco, where power would remain on, and the other in which potential chaos waits around the corner.\n\nWhen I stood on my front porch in East Oakland on the first day of planned shut-offs, everything seemed normal. A gentle breeze ruffled my hair and the trees. Renovation on two derelict houses across the street continued without interruption; gentrification couldn\u2019t afford to take the afternoon off. Crisp needles carpeted the lawn beneath the redwood tree in my backyard \u2014 combustible material waiting for a spark to ignite under the right conditions.\n\nAt present, my home lies just outside the shut-off zone, downward from the fire-prone hills. Today, living in the poorer \u201cflats\u201d has its advantages. But I have no guarantee the power will stay. Getting accurate and complete information has frustrated everyone. PG&E\u2019s website has remained down or only partially functioning since Tuesday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMany of us are winging it, keeping our fingers crossed that we are not among the unfortunates plunged into the dark. I went to bed with a number of questions for which I had only some answers: What conditions will we wake up to? (Who knows.). How will we make coffee? (Probably not at all.). Will trains run? (Yes.). How will I connect to the Internet? (Travel to somewhere with electricity.) Will we lose all of our perishable food? (Maybe.) How long can it last in the refrigerator? (Apparently, not as long as I thought.) Ice? (Oops. Too late now.)\n\nI rearrange my day for a possible blackout, working on tasks that require electricity and Internet connections in the morning. And I count my blessings that I am not one of the people most vulnerable to the loss of power.\n\nBut there is no blessing in what is happening to this state lately. The power outages have sparked anger at PG&E. The company\u2019s offices in Oroville closed Wednesday after vandalism, and a barricade went up around its headquarters in San Francisco for \u201cemployee safety.\u201d As a spokesperson said, \u201cWe have received feedback from frustrated customers.\u201d Once cut, restoring power isn\u2019t as easy as flipping a switch, and technicians will need to check overhead lines and transformers. This latest disruption won\u2019t end quickly.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMore unsettling are the long-term questions about what the shutdown portends: Is this the new normal? Advancing climate change and severe weather events coupled with crumbling infrastructure and a lack of will to invest publicly in fixing these problems don\u2019t inspire much optimism. Newsom expressed disapproval at PG&E\u2019s deferred maintenance that has created this situation, but he offered no clear vision for going forward. Though he said he supported the company\u2019s decision to take \u201cproactive measures\u201d to combat fire dangers, he added, \u201cThey\u2019re in bankruptcy because of their terrible management, going back decades,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for them to do the right thing. Get out of bankruptcy and get this system into the 21st century.\u201d Until then, we remain at the mercy of PG&E and the winds.\n\nCalifornia has the fifth-largest economy in the world. But in recent surveys, more than half of Californians have considered leaving the state and, for the first time, cite homelessness as a top concern. Across San Francisco, Oakland and Berkeley, apocalyptic scenes of tent encampments spread into new areas each day, it seems. In my corner of East Oakland, garbage from illegal dumping piles up on the streets. Perhaps we never had much confidence in institutions and essential services, but lately everything feels more on edge. Now we can\u2019t even count on the lights staying on.\n\nIn their 1960s folk classic \u201cCalifornia Dreamin\u2019,\u201d the Mamas and the Papas sang, \u201cAll the leaves are brown and the sky is gray,\u201d referring to a cold New York City and their longing to return to California\u2019s safety and warmth. These days the line could easily describe the California of the past few Octobers, as vegetation crisped and browned after a long period of drought and wildfire smoke choked the crystal-blue skies. Is the dream over? Maybe we\u2019re just waking up. And there\u2019s a lot of work to do.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The PG&E crisis illustrates just how far we\u2019ve come from the model we were supposed to be.", "authors": ["Stacy Torres"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/6tNIuqxXfhzGY0CnR8gB-VGvlC8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FJDWJGHLWAI6TEYGI7FQGJH5IQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
