Galaxy Club, which was first to spot the February 1st application, notes that the headset features two screens (one in each lens), and one image shows a cable running down its right arm (although it\u2019s unclear if this is a wired headset or if the cable is just meant for charging).\n\nThe unannounced headset would be Samsung\u2019s first foray into augmented reality after years of focusing on its lineup of mobile Gear VR headsets. However, in recent years, the entire mobile industry\u2019s interest in VR has decreased. Samsung hasn\u2019t released a new VR headset enclosure for its smartphones since 2017, and its latest flagship, the Note 10, is the first phone that\u2019s not compatible with the hardware. It\u2019s also getting pretty hard to buy the Gear VR headsets now that they\u2019re not available in the US through the Samsung store or Amazon.\n\nSamsung is not the only major phone manufacturer that\u2019s thought to be working on an augmented reality headset. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently predicted that Apple will launch its own augmented reality headset early next year, and one piece of documentation for iOS 13 contained an apparent reference to the unannounced hardware.\n\nAlthough Samsung is on the record as saying that it has \u201cmultiple AR and VR products\u201d in development, patent applications like these should always be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism. They can often represent products that are being developed internally but might never be released.", "description": "A newly discovered design patent application has revealed an unannounced Samsung augmented reality headset.
