Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) told reporters on Tuesday evening. \u201cIt is going to be expeditious. It's going to be quick, it has the speaker's full support, it has the Intel Committee\u2019s and Chairman's full support, and it is literally about impeachment. It is not about any other options.\u201d\n\nIn a closed-door caucus meeting on Tuesday afternoon, Pelosi explained to her caucus that the recent revelations about Trump\u2019s contact with the Ukrainian government\u2014in which he reportedly urged its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to open a dormant investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden\u2014constituted a national security threat. And she made it clear that time was of the essence.\n\n\u201cRight now, we have to strike while the iron is hot,\u201d Pelosi told Democrats, according to a senior Democratic aide. \u201cThis is a national security issue \u2013 a national security issue, and we cannot let him think that this is a casual thing, so that\u2019s where I\u2019m at.\u201d\n\nTo Pelosi and Democratic leadership, that simple fact makes Trump\u2019s alleged conduct, some of which he has admitted, an impeachable offense that warrants a quick, surgical strike from House Democratic investigators. It\u2019s a stark contrast to the sprawling, complex investigations into obstruction of justice outlined in Robert Mueller\u2019s report, which threatened to drag well into 2020 in the face of administration stonewalling for documents and testimony. And it differs in approach from inquiries that congressional Republicans have pursued in the past, including a special committee investigation into the 2011 consulate attacks in Benghazi that GOP officials kept going for years and even credited with damaging Hillary Clinton\u2019s approval ratings.\n\nDemocrats, including vocal impeachment advocates, said on Tuesday that they have no desire to replicate that approach. The thinking goes that if they were to keep an impeachment inquiry going into 2020, they would risk losing the support and attention of a swath of the American public.\n\n\u201cThe point of hearings is to drive home the information and that can be done in a discrete amount of time, definitely before the end of the year. Running an open-ended process has diminishing returns with the press, risks losing the thread and opens Democrats up to charges of fishing,\u201d said Adam Jentleson, a top Democratic operative who has not been shy in the sharp elbow he\u2019s thrown at lawmakers to start impeachment proceedings. \u201cYou play the hand you\u2019re dealt and if you try to string this into 2020 to mess with the calendar it will be obvious to everyone.\u201d\n\nThey also believe that, unlike with Benghazi attacks, the major incriminating information is already plainly and largely known, making the need for discovery less paramount.\n\n\u201cWhat we have is impeachment wrapped in a box with a bow on top,\u201d said Rep. Hank Johnson (D-GA), a Judiciary Committee member.\n\n\u201cThe pattern here is very straightforward,\u201d said Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.) \u201cWe are looking at one thing.\u201d\n\nBut while Democrats were nearly unanimous in their desire for speed, they seemed to differ in their apparent understanding of other key facets of that process. For example, the mechanics of how the House would begin a formal impeachment inquiry, which have been ill-explained for some time, remained murky on Tuesday. \u201cI wasn't clear about whether we're actually going to vote to open something, or we don't need to vote,\u201d said a Democratic lawmaker exiting the meeting.\n\nRep. Mike Quigley (D-IL), an Intelligence Committee member, told reporters he could not offer any details on exactly what exactly happens next. \u201cThis is a caucus meeting, it's not a planning meeting,\u201d he said.\n\nDemocratic members also appeared to be on different pages on another key part of the investigation\u2014who\u2019s running it\u2014which could affect how quickly the proceedings move. After speculation about leadership moving to create a select committee to handle the investigation into Trump-Ukraine matters as well as impeachment, Pelosi affirmed in the caucus meeting that Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) would retain his jurisdiction over the impeachment process, which Judiciary has historically wielded.\n\nIt was a close call. One senior Democratic aide said that leadership was very close to establishing a select committee to handle the formal inquiry. \u201cNadler dodged a bullet,\u201d one senior aide said.\n\nOnce more, speed was a consideration. Vocally pro-impeachment lawmakers had slammed the idea of establishing an entirely new committee to handle the Ukraine allegations, fearing that shifting the load away from Judiciary\u2014which has done months of work to date\u2014would slow down proceedings. Moderates, meanwhile, had warmed to the idea of siloing a national security-focused impeachment investigation into a new entity.\n\nSome Judiciary Committee members acknowledged their approach needs to change as they take up the mantle of an energized impeachment investigation.\n\n\u201cWe, of course, have to do better,\u201d said Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell (D-FL). \u201cI think that what's going to happen in the Judiciary Committee is that we're going to be expediting the process of our impeachment inquiry, and expediting maybe some of the hearings that we would have scheduled in the coming weeks. They may happen very quickly.\u201d\n\nIn the face of widespread agreement over the need to pick up the pace, it was left to a handful of Democrats\u2014members of a much-diminished group of impeachment skeptics\u2014to call for pumping the brakes.\n\nRep. Jeff Van Drew (D-N.J.), a moderate freshman, has long called on Democrats to give up impeachment and focus on legislation. He told reporters that the Ukraine revelations haven\u2019t much changed that viewpoint, and he urged Democrats to take a breath and review a transcript of Trump\u2019s conversation with Zelensky\u2014which the president has said he would release tomorrow\u2014before proceeding further.\n\n\u201cI personally would slow down for sure,\u201d said Van Drew. \u201cI mean, we're talking about a day here until we see the unredacted version of it.\u201d\n\nAnother impeachment holdout, Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-TX), one of the most centrist members of the caucus, deferred to Pelosi but declined to endorse impeachment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not just going to jump on just because everybody's jumping on,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, listen, if you look at the polls, where's the American public? Is there overwhelming support to impeach? It's not there yet. It's still not yet there.\u201d\n\n\u2014with reporting from Sam Stein and Jackie Kucinich", "description": "Lawmakers don\u2019t want the process dragging out into 2020.
