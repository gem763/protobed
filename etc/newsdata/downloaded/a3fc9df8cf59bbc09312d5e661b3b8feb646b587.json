He is just the sixth Democratic candidate to break the eight-figure mark in a quarterly fundraising period this year, joining Sanders, Buttigieg, Harris, former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Biden and Warren have not yet announced their third-quarter fundraising totals.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/22/ae/7e60d6384f7a9ada12fe622e6aed/yangregular.png\"\n\nThe Yang campaign said nearly 300,000 supporters have contributed so far, almost double the donor threshold required for candidates to qualify for the November debate.\n\n\"Andrew Yang is the only contender showing exponential growth in the third quarter, more than tripling his fundraising number from last quarter,\" campaign manager Zach Graumann said in a statement. \"This grassroots fundraising total, with $6 million-plus in the bank, ensures this campaign will have the funding to compete and outperform expectations through Super Tuesday and beyond.\"\n\nYang saw major surges in donations around the September debate. His campaign previously told POLITICO he raised $1 million in the 72 hours after the debate \u2014 in which he announced a contest to give 10 families $1,000 a month as a trial run for his \u201cFreedom Dividend,\u201d a proposed universal basic income program.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/52/5a/f829a1804af498ba577eeac07f6a/191001-yang-gty-773.jpg"}
