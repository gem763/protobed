They filed suit in 2017 seeking an injunction against a Minnesota law they say would force them to violate their Christian opposition to same-sex marriages. They fear their refusal to film LGBTQ weddings would leave them liable for a discrimination claim under the Minnesota Human Rights Act.\n\nIn August, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated their lawsuit previously thrown out by a federal judge. On Thursday, the Larsens\u2019 legal team, Alliance Defending Freedom, released a statement regarding Mr. Ellison\u2019s legal strategy.\n\n\u201cCarl and Angel are pleased that they will soon be able to enter the marriage industry and produce films that are consistent with their beliefs,\u201d said Alliance Defending Freedom senior counsel Jeremy Tedesco. \u201cWe look forward to securing a final victory that prevents the state from using its power to banish people of faith from the public square.\u201d\n\nMr. Tedesco said Minnesota\u2019s human rights statute would protect atheist musicians from feeling compelled to play a church service.\n\nIn the 8th Circuit opinion accompanying the 2-1 ruling, Judge David Stras, a Trump appointee, wrote \u201cthe First Amendment allows the Larsens to choose when to speak and what to say.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
