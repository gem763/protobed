Ms Lam urged foreign critics to accept that the four months of protests marked by escalating violence were no longer 'a peaceful movement for democracy'. She said seeking Chinese intervention was provided for under Hong Kong\u2019s constitution but that she cannot reveal under what circumstances she will do so.\n\n'We again urge Chris Patten and his like to immediately withdraw the black hand of meddling in Hong Kong affairs, stop harming Hong Kong with evil deals and halt the doomsday craziness,' a Chinese statement said yesterday.\n\nHong Kong's leader Carrie Lam last week invoked a colonial-era emergency law for the first time in more than 50 years to criminalise the wearing of masks at rallies in a bid to curb the city's escalating anti-Beijing unrest which started in June.\n\nThe ban was passed under the Emergency Regulations Ordinance, a relic of British rule.\n\nThe Ordinance was enacted in 1922 to quell a seamen's strike and was last used to crush riots in 1967.\n\nIt gives broad powers to the city's leader to implement regulations in a state of emergency.\n\nProtesters now can be jailed for up to one year under the law if they wear face masks to hide their identity.\n\nThe ban, which took effect on Saturday, sparked some of the most violent clashes in four months of demonstrations in the Asian financial hub, which saw activists hurling more dangerous petrol bombs, smashing subway station and vandalising businesses deemed pro-China.\n\nProtesters set barricade on fire at a demonstration in Causeway Bay district on Sunday\n\nProtesters are arrested by police during a clash at a demonstration in Wan Chai on Sunday\n\nThe rampages brought a warning from Lord Patten that people could be killed.\n\n'Before long, unless we are very, very lucky, people are going to get killed, people are going to be shot,' Lord Patten told Sky News.\n\n'The idea that with public order policing you send police forces out with live ammunition is preposterous.'\n\nBeijing-backed leader Lam said the ban on face masks was necessary to end violence and that it was her own government's call, not an order from Beijing.\n\nLord Patten blasted Lam, claiming she 'would have to be crazy to be making these decisions on her own without being pressured into them'.\n\nHe said: 'The face mask business [is] absolutely madness which people will protest against.'\n\nHe added that the way forward would be for Lam to engage with the demonstrators, especially the peaceful ones.\n\nPeople donning the Guy Fawkes masks protest against the ban in Kowloon on October 6\n\nBeijing-backed leader Carrie Lam (pictured) said the ban was necessary to end violence\n\nChina to stop showing NBA basketball games over Hong Kong row Chinese state broadcaster CCTV will no longer air two NBA pre-season games set to be played in the country, the station said today. CCTV indicated the decision was prompted by NBA Commissioner Adam Silver's remarks in Japan following a tweet by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey last week that supported anti-government demonstrations in Hong Kong. 'We're strongly dissatisfied and oppose Adam Silver's claim to support Morey's right to freedom of expression,' CCTV said. 'We believe that any remarks that challenge national sovereignty and social stability are not within the scope of freedom of speech.' Morey apologised on Monday for the tweet he swiftly deleted on the weekend. His initial tweet included an image captioned: 'Fight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong.'\n\nLord Patten's comments went against the mainstream opinions, claimed the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China in Hong Kong.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, a spokesperson said Lord Patten should 'look in the mirror' and reflect about Britain's own 'anti-mask law'.\n\nThe spokesperson accused Lord Patten of having double standards, arguing Britain was 'a forerunner' in using similar legislation during riots in London in 2011.\n\nThe spokesperson also cited Britain's Black Act in 1723 which criminalised poachers from blackening their faces to avoid identification while raiding other people's properties.\n\n'[His comments] completely exposed his true colour of being hypocritical, stubborn and cold-blooded,' the Office said. 'The Commissioner strongly condemns this.'\n\nThe authority said the introduction of the anti-mask law was 'legal, fair and reasonable' and represented the main-stream thoughts of the semi-autonomous city.\n\n'Hong Kong is China's Hong Kong. Hong Kong matters are purely China's internal affairs. We firmly support the government of the special administrative region to use all means necessary to end violence and chaos and restore social order.'\n\nLord Patten had been the government of Hong Kong for just short of five years when the city was returned from Britain to China in 1997 under an administrative principle known as 'one country, two systems'.\n\nA file picture taken on July 1, 1997, shows British and Chinese dignitaries taking part in the ceremony to revert Hong Kong's sovereignty from Britain to China after 99 years of lease\n\nPrince Charles and the last British Governor of Hong Kong Chris Patten (left) raise their glasses for the loyal toast prior to the colony's handover to China after 154 years of British rule\n\nThe policy was to guarantee Hong Kong greater freedoms than those on the mainland until 2047, such as freedom of speech and people's right to protest.\n\nLord Patten said in his farewell speech: 'It has been the greatest honour and privilege of my life to share your home for five years, and to have some responsibility for your future.\n\n'Now Hong Kong people are to run Hong Kong. That is the promise and that is the unshakable destiny.'\n\nHe was succeeded by Hong Kong's first Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa, who was present at the ceremony.\n\nThe handover ceremony, which ended more than 150 years of British control over the territory, was attended by Prince Charles, then Prime Minister Tony Blair, then Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and Hong Kong's last governor Chris Patten.\n\nChinese dignitaries included then President Jiang Zemin and late Premier Li Peng.", "description": "Beijing accused Lord Patten of confounding black and white, defending violence, and habouring evil intentions.
