Together they were working on Snitchler\u2019s concerns about her mental and physical health.\n\nOne concern was a cyst on her abdomen. The growth was about the size of a quarter, and it didn\u2019t hurt or particularly worry Snitchler. But it did make her self-conscious whenever she went for a swim.\n\n\u201cPeople would always call it out and be alarmed by it,\u201d she recalled.\n\nBefore having the cyst removed, Snitchler\u2019s doctor wanted to check the growth for cancer. After a first round of screening tests, Snitchler had an ultrasound-guided needle biopsy at Henry Ford Health System\u2019s main hospital.\n\nThe procedure was \u201cuneventful,\u201d with no complications reported, according to results faxed to her primary care doctor after the procedure. The growth was indeed benign, and Snitchler thought her next step would be getting the cyst removed.\n\nCallie Richmond for Kaiser Health News\n\nThen the bill came.\n\nThe Patient: Brianna Snitchler, 26, a user-experience designer living in Detroit at the time. As a contractor for Ford Motor Co., she had a UnitedHealthcare insurance plan.\n\nTotal Bill: $3,357.52, including a $2,170 facility fee listed as \u201coperating room services.\u201d The balance included a biopsy, ultrasound, physician charges and lab tests.\n\nService Provider: Henry Ford Health System in Detroit.\n\nMedical Procedure: Ultrasound-guided needle biopsy of a cyst.\n\nWhat Gives: When Snitchler scheduled the biopsy, no one told her that Henry Ford Health System would also charge her a $2,170 facility fee.\n\nSnitchler said the bill turned out to be far more than what she budgeted for. Her insurance plan from UnitedHealthcare had a high-deductible of $3,250, plus she would owe coinsurance. All told, her bills for the care she received related to the biopsy left her on the hook for $3,357.52, with her insurance paying $974.\n\n\u201cShe shrugged it off,\u201d Snitchler\u2019s partner, Emi Aguilar, recalled. \u201cBut I could see that she was upset in her eyes.\u201d\n\nSnitchler panicked when she realized the bill threatened the couple\u2019s financial security. Snitchler had already spent down her savings for a recent cross-country move to Austin, Texas.\n\nIn an email, Henry Ford spokesman David Olejarz said the \u201cprocedure was performed in the Interventional Radiology procedure room, where the imaging allows the biopsy to be much more precise.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe perform procedures in the most appropriate venue to ensure the highest standards of patient quality and safety,\u201d Olejarz wrote.\n\nThe initial bill from Henry Ford referred to \u201coperating room services.\u201d The hospital later sent an itemized bill that referred to the charge for a treatment room in the radiology department. Both descriptions boil down to a facility fee, a common charge that has become controversial as hospitals search for additional streams of income, and as more patients complain they\u2019ve been blindsided by these fees.\n\nHospital officials argue that medical centers need the boosted income to provide the expensive care sick patients require, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\n\nBut the way hospitals calculate facility fees is \u201ca black box,\u201d said Ted Doolittle, with the Office of the Healthcare Advocate for Connecticut, a state that has put a spotlight on the issue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s somewhat akin to a cover charge\u201d at a club, said Doolittle, who previously served as deputy director of the federal Center for Program Integrity at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.\n\nHospitals in Connecticut billed more than $1 billion in facility fees in 2015 and 2016, according to state records. In 2015, Connecticut lawmakers approved a bill that forces all hospitals and medical providers to disclose facility fees upfront. Now patients in Connecticut \u201cshould never be charged a facility fee without being shown in burning scarlet letters that they are going to get charged this fee,\u201d Doolittle said.\n\nIn Michigan, there\u2019s no law requiring hospitals and other providers of health care services to inform patients of facility fees ahead of time.\n\nBrianna Snitchler\u2019s procedure took place on campus at Henry Ford\u2019s main hospital site. When she got her bill, with its mention of \u201coperating room services,\u201d she was baffled. Snitchler said the room had \u201ccrazy medical equipment,\u201d but she was still in her street clothes as a nurse numbed her cyst and she was sent home in a matter of minutes.\n\nWith Snitchler\u2019s permission, Kaiser Health News shared her itemized bill, biopsy results and explanation of benefits with Dr. Mark Weiss, a radiologist who leads MediCrew, a company in Flint, Mich., that helps patients navigate the health system.\n\nWeiss said it probably wasn\u2019t medically necessary for Snitchler to go to the hospital to receive good care. \u201cNot all surgical procedures have to be done at a surgical center,\u201d he said, noting that biopsies often can be done in an office-based treatment center.\n\nCallie Richmond for Kaiser Health News\n\nResolution: Hoping for a reasonable explanation \u2014 or even the discovery of a mistake \u2014 Snitchler called her insurance company and the hospital.\n\nA representative at Henry Ford told her on the phone that the hospital isn\u2019t \u201clegally required\u201d to inform patients of fees ahead of time.\n\nIn an email, Henry Ford spokesman Olejarz apologized for that response: \u201cWe\u2019ll use it as a teachable moment for our staff. We are committed to being transparent with our patients about what we charge.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to an initiative launched in 2018 that helps patients anticipate out-of-pocket expenses. The program targets the most common elective radiology and gastroenterology tests that often have high price tags for patients.\n\nAsked if Snitchler\u2019s ultrasound-guided needle biopsy will be included in the price transparency initiative, Olejarz replied, \u201cCan\u2019t say at this point.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the pilot program to inform patients of fees, Olejarz said, the hospital also plans to roll out an online cost-estimator tool.\n\nFor now, Snitchler has decided not to get the cyst removed, and she plans to try to negotiate on her bill. She has not yet paid any portion of it.\n\n\u201cYou should always negotiate; you should always try,\u201d Doolittle said. \u201cDoesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to work, but it can work. People should not be shy about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are happy to work out a flexible payment plan that best meets her needs,\u201d Olejarz wrote when Kaiser Health News first inquired about Snitchler\u2019s bill.\n\nThe Takeaway: When your doctor recommends an outpatient test or procedure like a biopsy, be aware that the hospital may be the most expensive place you can have it done. Ask your physician for recommendations of where else you might have the procedure, and then call each facility to try to get an estimate of the costs you\u2019d face.\n\nAlso, be wary of places that may look like independent doctor\u2019s offices but are owned by a hospital. These practices also can tack hefty facility fees onto your bill.\n\nIf you get a bill that seems inflated, call your hospital and insurer and try to negotiate it down.\n\nBill of the Month is a crowdsourced investigation by Kaiser Health News and NPR that dissects and explains medical bills.
