Though Facebook wasn\u2019t the only social media company targeted, it was certainly one of the largest.\n\nFacebook\u2019s approach to election protections has changed since the 2016 presidential elections, Facebook\u2019s Vice President of Integrity, Guy Rosen, told Yahoo Finance in an exclusive interview.\n\n\u201cIf you think about how we approach elections broadly, not just 2016, how we think about the work we do going forward,\u201d he said, \u201cit's evolved a lot in the past few years.\u201d\n\nFacebook currently has 1.59 billion daily active users and 2.41 billion monthly active users, according to its second-quarter financial results. \u201cThat's hundreds of millions of people who use Facebook who went to the polls,\u201d Rosen said. \u201cAnd we felt we had to make sure that we were bringing our best foot forward and that we were building those defenses.\u201d\n\n\u2018New types of threats\u2019\n\nRosen said the company has initiated a line of defense. \u201cA lot of what we have done and built in the past few years is trying to address holistically all the range of problems that we see across elections,\u201d Rosen said. \u201cAnd we've implemented this, not just for 2020, but for the 2018 midterms, for India and Indonesia and the EU parliament, who had really big elections earlier this year.\u201d\n\nFrom left to right: Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer; Facebook Head of Global Policy Management Monika Bickert; John DeVine, VP of Global Operations; and Guy Rosen, VP of Integrity. More\n\nThe Facebook executive spoke about the topic of alleged election interference as part of a wide-ranging interview that Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer conducted with him and two other executives who oversee content at Facebook: VP of Global Operations John DeVine and Head of Global Policy Management Monika Bickert.\n\nRosen explained that in 2016, the company\u2019s biggest concerns were account hacking and leaked information \u2014 but that has changed, Rosen said. \u201cI think all of us and the world have learned that there are new types of threats, there are governments that are looking to influence public opinion, to distribute information.\u201d\n\nThe company now has three main priorities: removing fake accounts, preventing the spread of misinformation, and advertising transparency.\n\n\u201cFacebook is really about authenticity and making sure that we are building the defenses that can take down fake accounts at scale \u2014 and find a needle in a haystack, the sophisticated actors who may be trying to distribute content and aren't who they say they are,\u201d Rosen said.\n\nInside Facebook More\n\n\u201cIt's about bringing transparency to advertising. If you want to run an ad that talks about a political or social issue, for example here in the U.S., we need to make sure that you are who you say you are. We ask for ID. We will verify. And we will show who is actually running the ad.\u201d\n\nIn May, Facebook released a post detailing the company\u2019s approach to fake accounts as part of its \u201cHard Questions series,\u201d which addresses the impact of Facebook\u2019s products on society.\n\nBut Rosen said Facebook can\u2019t do it alone. He noted that Facebook has been working with other companies in the industry, law enforcement and the security community to make sure that there is a mutual effort towards a shared goal of protecting the American people against false truths.", "description": "Yahoo Finance's Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer sat down for an exclusive interview with Facebook's Vice President of Integrity to discuss misinformation, fake accounts and ad transparency.", "authors": ["Heidi Chung"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aeW5IJDCyOMlBGz1ohHUsQ--~B/aD0zMjQxO3c9NDk3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/623a1430-d33d-11e9-beed-8b159b91f190", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
