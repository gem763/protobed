Ignoring the events of Rise of the Machines, Salvation, and Genisys, Terminator: Dark Fate is a direct sequel to 1991\u2019s Terminator 2: Judgment Day and it\u2019s the most feminist film of the franchise to date.\n\nThat\u2019s partly due to the contributions of its stars Mackenzie Davis and Linda Hamilton. As Grace, a protector sent to defend Natalie Reyes\u2019 Dani from a new Terminator (Gabriel Luna), Davis shares many scenes with Hamilton\u2019s Sarah Connor. Davis says she worked with the writers and Hamilton \u2013 returning for the first time as Connor since T2 \u2013 to fine tune the exchanges between their characters.\n\nThough she admits Grace was \u201cpretty well-formed\u201d in the script which is credited to six men (David S. Goyer, Justin Rhodes, Billy Ray, James Cameron, Charles Eglee and Josh Friedman), Davis told us that they worked on how their characters interacted and make it less catty.\n\n\u201cI think the thing Linda [Hamilton] and I were focused on is when we started our characters were real antagonists, and they still are in the film, but there was some stuff that we didn't quite understand and couldn't justify,\u201d the Blade Runner 2049 star explained to Yahoo Movies UK.\n\nRead more: First reactions to Dark Fate\n\n\u201c[There was] a constant sniping at each other and we just wanted our rivalry to be rooted in a real relationship [where] there was nothing superfluous about [it] or just hateful without a basis.\n\n\u201cWe both have a mission and any sort of antagonism needed to come out of that mission and not be extraneous to it, so that's something that we focused on,\u201d Davis added.\n\nTerminator: Dark Fate (20th Century Fox) More\n\nGabriel Luna was privy to these conversations and said it was important that his co-stars were able to get their opinions across.\n\n\u201cI think that's a huge contribution you guys made,\u201c he said. \u201cI remember being around when those conversations were being had and, yeah, there is that competition but then there was this really wonderful shared duty to Dani.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for actors to have input on their character\u2019s motivations or dialogue, and it seems particularly wise to have it on a film which boasts three female leads like Dark Fate. Just recently, Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge was drafted in to help with rewrites on No Time To Die, the next James Bond film, and was tasked with paying particular attention to the film\u2019s female characters.\n\n\u201cI just want to make sure that when they get those pages through, that Lashana [Lynch], L\u00e9a [Seydoux] and Ana [De Armas] open them and go, \u2018I can\u2019t wait to do thatm,\u2019\u201d Waller-Bridge told Deadline. \u201cAs an actress, I very rarely had that feeling early in my career. That brings me much pleasure, knowing that I\u2019m giving that to an actress.\u201d\n\nThe Dark Fate stars also responded to comments made by Martin Scorsese regarding what defines cinema.\n\nRead more: Jennifer Aniston criticises Marvel movies\n\nStory continues", "description": "The actor says she and Linda Hamilton raised the issue with how Grace and Sarah Connor's relationship was being presented.", "authors": ["Hanna Flint"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rTYzuS3.9lcokEHlra5W0w--~B/aD0xMzY1O3c9MjA0ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/creatr-images/GLB/2018-08-01/073a3fc0-958f-11e8-8971-49e765fe0f62_DjhC09PU4AAt-4V.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
