Champions Barcelona are eighth on seven points after Saturday\u2019s shock 2-0 defeat at promoted Granada.\n\n\u201cReal Madrid never loses its hunger or its desire to win,\u201d captain Sergio Ramos told reporters.\n\n\u201cWe knew how difficult this game would be, we hadn\u2019t won here for many years, but we arrived with a very strong mentality and intent on committing as few errors as possible. Apart from a couple of set pieces, we had the game under control.\u201d\n\nReal had lost on their last four league visits to the Sanchez Pizjuan stadium and were thrashed 3-0 there last season, a game that spelled the beginning of the end for Lopetegui, who was sacked by the club little more than a month later.\n\nCurrent coach Zinedine Zidane travelled to Seville facing serious questions about his own leadership of the team after they were hammered 3-0 by PSG in their Champions League group stage opener after failing to have a shot on target.\n\nBut Real produced a very different type of performance this time, which Zidane hailed as the best he had seen since returning to the club in March.\n\nDIFFICULT MOMENTS\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the game which leaves me the most satisfied since I came back, everyone on the pitch helped out,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe had difficult moments but we showed great solidarity with each other in those moments. We played 90 minutes at a top level at a very difficult stadium. This is a victory for the group and I\u2019m delighted for everyone.\u201d\n\nSevilla\u2019s entire squad had only recently returned from a gruelling 12,000-km round trip to Baku to face Qarabag in the Europa League on Thursday and lacked their usual aggression and intensity as a scrappy game ensued.\n\nCarvajal had the visitors\u2019 best chance before the interval, firing straight at keeper Tomas Vaclik from inside the area, while Gareth Bale also tested the Czech with a stinging free kick.\n\nNeither side looked willing to take a risk to try and take the lead but the deadlock was finally broken thanks to some clever teamwork from the visitors, as Bale released Carvajal down the right wing and Benzema produced the perfect finish.\n\nSlideshow (7 Images)\n\nThe goal sparked Sevilla into life and they spent most of the remaining minutes pressing for an equaliser, but Real dug deep to grind out a hugely significant victory.\n\n\u201cWe did what we came here to achieve and now we can relax again after everything that was said about us this week,\u201d added Ramos.\n\n\u201cThis team is always optimistic, and we are going to get better. It\u2019s a long season and we\u2019re already joint-top of the league.\u201d", "description": "Real Madrid produced a gutsy performance to earn a 1-0 win at Sevilla on Sunday, which took them level on points at the top of La Liga, having been wounded by a humiliating Champions League defeat at Paris St Germain in midweek.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432836899&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M0AE", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
