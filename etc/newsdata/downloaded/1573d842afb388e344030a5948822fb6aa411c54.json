He was an expert in non-Euclidean geometry whose work on field equations and tensor calculus proved instrumental in synthesising mathematical and theoretical physics, establishing a link between gravitational force and the geometry of spacetime. The reason you probably haven\u2019t heard of him is that his achievements were largely overshadowed by his friend and collaborator, a guy called Albert Einstein.\n\nWhile Einstein incorporated Grossman\u2019s ideas into what would become his 1915 general theory of relativity, and became one of the most famous scientists in history, Grossman died in 1936 to virtually zero fanfare outside the mathematics community. And in any number of other fields, the history books are littered with outstanding talents whose dubious misfortune was to operate in the shadow of a more celebrated contemporary. Haydn and Beethoven. Anne Sexton and Sylvia Plath. Grace Hartigan and Jackson Pollock. Art Garfunkel and Paul Simon. Stuart Broad and James Anderson.\n\nInto this category we might also tentatively insert Joel Matip: a man whose labours have gone largely unheralded as a result of the titan playing alongside him. Virgil van Dijk is seen as the gemstone of the Liverpool FC defence, and fair enough: he\u2019s extremely good. Equally, though, it feels churlish not to mention the man who has come from fourth-choice centre-half to establish himself as Van Dijk\u2019s natural partner.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Between August 2018 and January 2019, Matip started just five out of 28 games in Premier League and Champions League. Indeed, if you saw Matip at all last autumn, it would most likely have been as a time-wasting 90th-minute substitute, someone you throw in when you\u2019re 2-1 up and expecting a barrage of long balls.\n\nMarooned behind the outstanding Joe Gomez and World Cup finalist Dejan Lovren, and suffering from a collarbone injury, Matip seemed destined for the fringes of the squad, perhaps even the exit door. At which point, fate took a hand. Gomez broke his leg, and with Lovren\u2019s form in decline, Matip found himself back in the side. He hasn\u2019t relinquished his spot since.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Chelsea vs Liverpool player ratings Show all 24 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

In other words, a game full of the sort of defending Matip loves. Since the emergence of Van Dijk, you often see opposing strikers targeting his partner, and from the early stages it was clear Tammy Abraham was set on doing the same. Instead, Matip came away with the man-of-the-match award: the weak link that isn\u2019t.\n\nSo what\u2019s been the secret? Naturally, Matip isn\u2019t as technically adept as Van Dijk, and nor is he as quick over the turf. You don\u2019t want him covering huge swathes of the field, or chasing counter-attacks up the touchline. And in the early years of his Liverpool career, he was guilty of the odd flat-footed error, as culpable as anyone for their weakness at set pieces. But with surer foundations now in place around him, Matip can concentrate on what he does best: heading balls away all day long.\n\nAs Chelsea swung in cross after cross, put up raking diagonals for Abraham to chase into the channels, Matip held firm. In a way, he is the ideal foil for Van Dijk in these games: a sort of first-responder, winning the initial contact before Van Dijk steams in to take control of the situation. That seems to be borne out in their respective statistics: Matip making more tackles and interceptions, Van Dijk making more clearances and passes.\n\n\u201cNot a lot of people spoke about the impact Joel Matip had in the last third of the season,\u201d Jurgen Klopp groused over the summer. \u201cI don\u2019t see a lot of centre-backs in the world who are better in that period, 100 per cent, pretty much without any mistakes.\u201d And it\u2019s true that Matip\u2019s consistency and concentration have greatly improved since his return to the side.\n\nEqually, though, it\u2019s hard to overlook the fact that the quality of the players around him has undergone similar improvement. A well-drilled pressing unit around him. A scurrying midfield snuffing out danger in front of him. A world-class goalkeeper behind him. Most of all, he has one of the best defenders in the world alongside him to learn from. Perhaps, like many before him, Matip will never quite escape the immense shadow of the giant Dutchman to his left. But in a team with an unstinting focus on the collective, perhaps every Einstein needs his Grossman.", "description": "The Swiss mathematician Marcel Grossman has a fair claim to be one of the most important scientists of the last 200 years.
