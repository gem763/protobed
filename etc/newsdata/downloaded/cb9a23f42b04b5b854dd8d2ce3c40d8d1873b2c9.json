But during tonight\u2019s debate, he aggressively claimed the mantle of patriotism, and by extension, presidential leadership.\n\n\u201cWhen we abandon the international stage, and when we think our only choices are between endless war or total isolation,\u201d Buttigieg said, \u201cthe consequence is the disappearance of U.S. leadership.\u201d\n\nButtigieg wasn\u2019t the only candidate to call for a return to classic American statesmanship. At the beginning of the debate, as each candidate explained why House Democrats should pursue an impeachment inquiry against the president, several invoked the sacredness of the Constitution itself.\n\n\u201cOur Framers imagined this moment, a moment where we would have a corrupt president,\u201d Senator Kamala Harris of California said. \u201cAnd our Framers then rightly designed our system of democracy to say there will be checks and balances. This is one of those moments. And so Congress must act.\u201d\n\nImpeaching Trump is not about partisanship, added Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts: \u201cSometimes, there are issues that are bigger than politics.\u201d\n\nOn many key issues\u2014Medicare for All, taxes, immigration\u2014the Democratic Party is wrestling with itself over what it is and what it wants to become. It\u2019s also figuring out how far it wants to push the limits of America\u2019s political discourse.\n\nAnd even though those disagreements are intense, it seems that the major candidates agree on a fundamental concept: American democracy has suffered under Trump, and the next president must work to restore some of the old ways of politics. In a political era defined by anger about the so-called D.C. swamp, this rhetoric is a bold bet that voters may not want to take down traditional Washington as much as they say.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
