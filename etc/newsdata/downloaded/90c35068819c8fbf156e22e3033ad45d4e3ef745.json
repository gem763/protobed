Johnson & Johnson would pay $4 billion over time. Drugmaker Teva would contribute the drugs, but not cash.\n\nA $50 billion framework was first reported Wednesday by The New York Times. It\u2019s not clear whether states and local governments will accept the deal.\n\nThe person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks were ongoing and said the details of the deal could change. Drug companies and state attorneys general who are leading the negotiations either did not return messages or comment.\n\nThe talks are picking up as a jury is being selected in Cleveland for a trial on claims against some companies in the drug industry being brought by the Ohio counties of Cuyahoga and Summit. They claim the companies engaged in a conspiracy that has damaged their communities and want to hold them accountable.\n\nJury selection began Wednesday and could wrap up Thursday, with opening arguments scheduled for Monday. Johnson & Johnson has already settled with the two counties. If the other companies settle, it would leave only the pharmacy chain Walgreens \u2014 in its role as a distributor to its own stores \u2014 and the smaller distributor Henry Schein as defendants. It\u2019s not clear whether the trial would go on in that case.\n\nWhile the case concerns only claims for two counties, it is a bellwether intended to show how legal issues might be resolved in more than 2,000 other lawsuits over opioids. Painkillers and their illegal versions have been linked to more than 400,000 deaths in the U.S. over the past two decades.\n\n___\n\nMulvihill reported from Cherry Hill, New Jersey.
