The coverage has been, on average, 90% negative according to a series of studies by the Media Research Center.\n\nThese days, the Democratic presidential hopefuls are paying a price for this obsession. Networks\u2019 \u201cfixation on Trump\u201d is leaving comparatively little airtime for his would-be presidential challengers, the conservative press watch dog says in a new analysis released Monday.\n\n\u201cFrom June 1 through August 31, analysts found the networks devoted 838 minutes of airtime \u2014 nearly 14 hours \u2014 to coverage of President Trump personally, the vast majority of which was negative,\u201d writes Rich Noyes, who led the study.\n\n\u201cThe airtime devoted to Trump was eleven times greater than that spent on the leading Democratic candidate, former Vice President Joe Biden (just under 74 minutes), and vastly more than the networks gave California Senator Kamala Harris (30 minutes), South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg (15 minutes) or Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren (just under 14 minutes),\u201d Mr. Noyes said.\n\n\u201cOverall, 21 Democratic candidates (including some who have since departed the race) shared 187 minutes of evening news airtime this summer, less than one-fourth of that of Trump alone,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cOn the GOP side, former Congressman Joe Walsh received a scant 35 seconds of coverage after he announced his candidacy in late August, while the campaign of former Massachusetts Governor William Weld has yet to be acknowledged by any of the three evening newscasts.\u201d\n\nThe coverage, Mr. Noyes explains, is not meant to help Mr. Trump, with the content dwelling on \u201calleged scandals and racism\u201d for the most part.\n\n\u201cThe media mania over Trump is more intense than that of four summers ago, but the pattern is similar. After Trump joined the race in mid-June 2015, he immediately dominated network news coverage with 232 minutes of airtime, twice that of the leading Democrat, Hillary Clinton, and six times more than his nearest Republican challenger, Jeb Bush,\u201d Mr. Noyes said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
