Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Monday unveiled her public education proposal, which includes halting the \u201cprivatization\u201d of public schools, stopping vouchers, enhancing protections for illegal immigrant students, and quadrupling Title I funding.\n\nWhile there are many facets to Warren\u2019s plan, she devotes a significant section to combating the \u201cprivatization\u201d of public schools. It is necessary, Warren says, to \u201cresist efforts to divert public funds out of traditional public schools.\u201d She continued:\n\nTo keep our traditional public school systems strong, we must resist efforts to divert public funds out of traditional public schools. Efforts to expand the footprint of charter schools, often without even ensuring that charters are subject to the same transparency requirements and safeguards as traditional public schools, strain the resources of school districts and leave students behind, primarily students of color.\n\nBecause of that, Warren is calling for the end of vouchers, tuition tax credits, and federally-funded expansions of charter schools. She also calls for a full ban of for-profit charter schools.\n\n\u201cWe should stop the diversion of public dollars from traditional public schools through vouchers or tuition tax credits \u2013 which are vouchers by another name,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cWe should fight back against the privatization, corporatization, and profiteering in our nation\u2019s schools,\u201d she added.\n\nThat stands in contrast with the position Warren took in the past, particularly ahead of her 2012 senatorial campaign. She actually championed vouchers and assessed that they \u201ctake pressure off parents\u201d in terms of having to purchase homes in neighborhoods zoned for desirable schools. She added that vouchers encourage competition and produce results, creating something \u201cparents can buy into and believe in.\u201d\n\nWarren also painted a dire picture of a public education system, where both segregation and discrimination are, she believes, running rampant.\n\n\u201cBut broad public affirmation of the Brown v. Board of Education decisions in the 1950s and recent debates about historical desegregation policies have obscured an uncomfortable truth \u2013 our public schools are more segregated today than they were about thirty years ago,\u201d Warren claimed, weaving in her \u201cHousing Plan for America\u201d as a viable solution for these issues and ignoring her past calls for vouchers, which 2011 Warren suggested would help remedy the disparity.\n\nAdditionally, the presidential hopeful\u2019s plan enhances protections for illegal immigrant students, calling the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies \u201cinhumane\u201d and attributing them to the increase of fear among illegal immigrant families. She said:\n\nImmigration makes America stronger \u2013 economically, socially, and culturally. But because of the Trump Administration\u2019s inhumane immigration policies, many immigrant students are afraid to go to school, and many families living in the shadows are afraid to access resources like free school lunch. I would end the Trump\u2019s Administration\u2019s monstrous policies and enact immigration reform that is fair, humane, and reflects our values. I will ensure immigrant students don\u2019t get second-class status by being directed into GED programs instead of classrooms. I will protect sensitive locations like schools from immigrant enforcement actions. And I\u2019ll recommit OCR to upholding and enforcing Plyler v. Doe \u2013 which the Trump administration has tried to undermine \u2013 so that all immigrant children have access to a quality education, no matter their native language, national origin, immigration status, or educational history.\n\nShe also promises to affirm the rights of LGBT students by reinstating the \u201cguidance revoked under Trump about transgender students\u2019 rights under Title IX, and make clear that federal civil rights law prohibits anti-LGBTQ+ rules like discriminatory dress codes, prohibiting students from writing or discussing LGBTQ+ topics in class, or punishing students for bringing same-sex partners to school events.\u201d\n\nIn another section, Warren pledges to push a guidance that would \u201climit the use of discriminatory dress codes targeting student dress and hairstyle,\u201d which she says leads to \u201cstudents of color losing valuable learning time and Muslim students being denied participation in school activities.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s plan also proposes the cancelation of student breakfast and lunch debt, as well as free school meals and free universal pre-K, which she has said she would pay for via her \u201cwealth tax.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to live up to the promise of a high-quality public education for every student,\u201d Warren wrote. \u201cMy plan makes big, structural changes that would help give every student the resources they need to thrive.\u201d", "description": "Warren unveiled her public education proposal, which includes enhancing protections for illegal immigrant students and ending vouchers.", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1176421269-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
