I know he's going to get his revenge. Not if but when he does it, I want people to remember me for the person who tried to get justice for what he\u2019s done.'\n\nCandice Lee, 51, from Derbyshire, told on This Morning how she was secretly drugged by her husband Stephen Lee during their marriage when she threatened to end it\n\nCandice, who shares 17-year-old daughter Rhona with Lee, explained to Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford how it felt being deceived by the man she trusted.\n\n'When you first meet somebody you don\u2019t expect it to turn sinister.\n\n'When you're thinking of domestic abuse you think of someone hitting you, shouting at you and demoralising and ruining your confidence.\n\n'He did all of that. On top of that it was the drugs he was giving me.'\n\nShe said soon after they married in 2001, that Lee became like 'Jekyll and Hyde' and would punish her by not speaking to her for eight days for no reason.\n\nBack in 2016, Candice discovered that her husband had moved out thanks to a text message to their daughter, telling her he wasn't coming home.\n\nBut just five weeks later Lee returned and things for Candice took a sinister turn.\n\nShe pinpoints April 2017 as the moment she suddenly started feeling unwell.\n\nCandice was worried she was being drugged but because she didn't know what exactly it was, doctors told her they were unable to test her.\n\nStephen Lee admitted guilt to drugging his wife with intent and voyeurism but walked free when he was handed a suspended sentence\n\nDesperate to uncover the truth about her ill health, Candice went to the police in September 2017, who recommended she go to Derby Royal Infirmary A&E.\n\nA urine test revealed she had been unknowingly consuming sleeping pills and anti-depressants.\n\nPolice searched their marital home and unearthed empty pill packets in their bedroom drawers as well as the hidden camera.\n\n'I felt so sick. They found in a speaker a hidden video camera. And they also found some hard copy photos in his drawer.'\n\nShe didn't have any recollection of the photos, explaining she could barely look at them because they were of her and different body parts while she was unconscious.\n\nCandice explained that Lee would spike her food and drink and noticed when she began to feel unwell. At first doctors were unable to test her because they didn't know what to look for\n\nCandice said of her horrifying experience: 'When he used to drug me within five or 10 minutes I'd be completely out of it. He wasn\u2019t just drugging me, he was overdosing me.\n\n'To start with it was mainly food. I like spicy food so it was putting it in curries and things like that.'\n\nQuestioned by Eamonn if she believed Lee's sentence was lenient because he was her husband, Candice agreed.\n\n'I think you could be right. I don't know why he got such a low sentence as he did.\n\n'They said they couldn't prove he was drugging me for the photos but clearly my daughter's witness statement it said everything they need to know about how he was drugging me.'\n\nThis Morning airs weekdays on ITV at 10.30am", "description": "Candice Lee,\u00a051, from Derbyshire, told of her terrifying nightmare on This Morning sharing how vile Stephen Lee would spike her food and drink with anti-depressants and sleeping pills.", "authors": ["Natalie Corner For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/12/19882120-0-image-a-47_1571399985079.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
