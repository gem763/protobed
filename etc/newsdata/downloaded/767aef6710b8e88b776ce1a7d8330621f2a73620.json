Nothing like throwing your \"Alabama\" NWS office under the bus. pic.twitter.com/Fx0oAdWlh7 \u2014 Ryan Maue (@RyanMaue) September 6, 2019\n\nThe unnamed NOAA official also claimed that the information it provided to Trump last weekend showed that Dorian could produce tropical-storm-force winds in the state.\n\nTo prove its point, the agency included a link to a probability model predicting that there was a 5% to 10% probability that tropical force storm winds would affect Alabama for a few days.\n\nHowever, meteorologist Ryan Maue pointed out that another model from Sept. 1, when Trump first sent his tweet, showed that Alabama \u201cwas definitely outside of any threat cone.\u201d\n\nHere was the 12z September 1, 2019 \"spaghetti plot\" ... Alabama was definitely outside of any threat cone. pic.twitter.com/mm9hL4rKQN \u2014 Ryan Maue (@RyanMaue) September 6, 2019\n\nGetting to the substance of the NOAA statement:https://t.co/LlRIjBN71N\n\n\n\nAnimation of the wind speed probabilities for 34-knot (Tropical Storm) Winds.\n\n\n\nThere was indeed a 5-10% shaded green area of TS wind probability over a sliver of AL actually until Tuesday. \u2014 Ryan Maue (@RyanMaue) September 6, 2019\n\nOn Sunday, as Hurricane Dorian made its way toward the Carolinas, Trump warned several states, including Alabama, about \u201cone of the largest hurricanes ever,\u201d tweeting that those states would \u201cmost likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated.\u201d\n\nLess than a half-hour later, NWS Birmingham corrected Trump by notifying residents that they would \u201cNOT see any impacts\u201d from Dorian.\n\n\u201cThe system will remain too far east,\u201d the state weather agency tweeted.\n\nIn addition to Florida - South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated. Looking like one of the largest hurricanes ever. Already category 5. BE CAREFUL! GOD BLESS EVERYONE! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 1, 2019\n\nAlabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east. #alwx \u2014 NWS Birmingham (@NWSBirmingham) September 1, 2019\n\nThough the clash happened last weekend, Trump continued to defend his tweet and complain about the flak he\u2019s received over media reports that point out that he was wrong.\n\nThe president held a hurricane briefing on Wednesday and presented a map with old data showing Dorian\u2019s trajectory. The map also appeared to be modified with a black marking that encompassed part of Alabama.\n\nTrump continued to air his grievances on Twitter, slamming the \u201cFake News.\u201d He also walked his original tweet back by saying that \u201cAlabama was going to be hit or grazed\u201d before Dorian \u201ctook a different path.\u201d\n\nAnd in another attempt to prove he wasn\u2019t wrong, the president tweeted an edited video of a CNN segment that noted Alabama might feel the effects of the hurricane.\n\nThe video ended with a clip of the CNN logo juxtaposed over a vehicle involved in a fiery crash.", "description": "NOAA issued an unsigned statement saying that NWS Birmingham's tweet contradicting Trump was \"inconsistent\" with data at that time.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d72d622240000292177c5da.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
