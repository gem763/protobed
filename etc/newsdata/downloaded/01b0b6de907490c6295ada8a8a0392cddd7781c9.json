Gold, the top hedge in the event of a rate cut, meanwhile, sunk deeper beneath its key bullish mark of $1,500.\n\n\u201cPalladium has been an unstoppable force in precious metals this year and rightly so because of the increasing regulations on auto emissions and the dire short supply of the metal, which is the solution for that,\u201d said Philip Streible, commodities strategist at RJO Futures in Chicago.\n\n\u201cIn gold\u2019s case, other than the 25-basis-point rate cut we\u2019re expecting tomorrow, there\u2019s very little to look forward to unless the Fed turns incredibly dovish in its outlook language,\u201d Streible said. \u201cFor now, there\u2019s very little hope for a December cut, too, because many think the Fed is done here.\u201d\n\nThe , reflective of physical trades, hit a record high of $1,804.40 before consolidating at below $1,785 in New York\u2019s late-afternoon trade.\n\nThe most-active contract on New York Mercantile Exchange\u2019s Comex settled down $24.20, or 1.3%, at $1,755.10 per ounce after hitting an all-time high at $1,779.30.\n\nfor December delivery settled down $5.10, or 0.3%, at $1,490.70. In post-settlement trade it was down $3.75, or 0.3%, at $1,492.05 by 3:10 PM ET (19:10 GMT).\n\n, which tracks live trades in bullion, was down $2.62, or 0.2%, at $1,489.89.\n\nA CNBC Fed survey said that 63% believe the U.S. central bank will pause for the rest of the year after its October easing. On average, the respondents, who include fund managers, economists and strategists, think the next cut will come in February. Even so, 40% believe the Fed might stay even through 2020.\n\nShould gold drop lower post-Fed, it may have to sink as low as $1,450 to really attract strong buying, TD Securities said in a note.\n\n\u201cWe expect the Fed to communicate patience, (so) prices near recent lows would not be surprising in the short term, until weakness in the data and resumed rate cuts into 2020 support a further gold rally,\u201d it said. \u201cGiven the recent stalling of the gold rally, the strength of positive momentum signals have been waning.\u201d", "description": "Gold Sinks as Markets Await Fed; Palladium Moves Beyond $1,800", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA680GO_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
