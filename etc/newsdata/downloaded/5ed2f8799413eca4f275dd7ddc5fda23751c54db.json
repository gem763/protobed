The last week has been eventful, even by Age O\u2019 Trump standards, and the one enduring takeaway is just how bad these people are at gaslighting us with inept lies that demand we disbelieve what\u2019s happening right in front of us. But it should come as no surprise that our alleged betters are no good at gaslighting because they have proven themselves to be no good at anything.\n\nHere\u2019s a fun test: can you name something \u2013 anything \u2013 major in the last two decades that our best and brightest have not screwed up?\n\nI\u2019ll wait.\n\nGaslighting is their default move because gaslighting is all these losers have. It\u2019s not like they can sit back and let you read their CV of achievements. Iraq, Obamacare, their annoying millennial kids\u2026all disasters. The members of America\u2019s current ruling class are King Midases of failure. Everything they touch turns to suck.\n\nSo, because they have no other way to deal with the damning evidence of their utter incompetence, our elite instead tries to convince us that we are crazy for noticing just how lame they are. That\u2019s called \u201cgaslighting,\u201d the straight-faced denial of what\u2019s happening right in front of you that tries to leverage your politeness and deference to convince you that it\u2019s not the elite that\u2019s rotten. You\u2019re just crazy for noticing, you crazed crazy person of craziness.\n\nTake the Northern Syrian crisis \u2013 please. I generally side with the non-commie Kurds over the Turks, but facts are facts and facts mean something. We keep hearing how we \u201cbetrayed our allies,\u201d but who promised the Kurds that we would fight Turkey on their behalf? It\u2019s a big jump from \u201cLet\u2019s both fight ISIS\u201d to \u201cTake that, NATO ally.\u201d But our garbage media, and our garbage politicians, sort of hand wave away the fact that you can\u2019t \u201cbetray\u201d someone by not doing what you never promised to do, especially when no reasonable person could ever expect you to do it.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the Kurdish monolith issue \u2013 all Kurds are not created equal. There are different Kurd factions and different Kurd groups, and some Kurds are communists. In fact, we\u2019ve designated the very Kurds Turkey says it\u2019s going after (the PKK) as terrorists based on their actual terrorism. Certainly, at the start of the story you probably couldn\u2019t have expected our reporters and our politicians to tell Kurd X from Kurd Y without a program (in a better world, though, we\u2019d expect them to zip it until they could), but when we\u2019re a week-plus into what is allegedly the greatest atrocity ever was (because they think they can pin it on Trump) and they are still pretending that all Kurds are sweet n\u2019 cuddly, they are lying to you.\n\nHow about the response on Capitol Hill? We\u2019ve got a bunch of politicians posing and posturing and prancing about over this border incursion half-way around the world and we\u2019re sitting here wishing they would devote some of that wailing and teeth-gnashing to the incursions over our border. But once again, they act like we can\u2019t see the truth sitting right there. As for the Democrats, well, how long would their support have lasted if Trump had used force against\u2026our NATO ally? \u201cYou\u2019re helping Putin!\u201d they would shriek. Of course, they are currently shrieking, \u201cYou\u2019re helping Putin!\u201d when Trump doesn\u2019t use force against Turkey.\n\nAnd then there are the Republicans who holler and cry, raging over this terrible situation as if there wasn\u2019t some way for our pols to influence events by, oh, I dunno, offering a resolution declaring war. That\u2019s a thing in the Constitution, I hear.\n\nBut taking votes means taking stands, and virtue signaling is no fun if that signal is, \u201cI want you to send your sons and daughters to maybe die to sort out this latest 2000-year-old brawl between this latest bunch of strangers,\u201d and the voters you signal it to are sick of stupid wars that never seem to end.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the phony outrage over some silly meme where fake Donald Trump fights fake logos of the fake news. They insist that this year-old YouTube clip is going to spark terrifying violence against\u2026I guess, CNN and MSNBC logos. Of course, these trademarks have remained unassaulted since this silly, fakey vid was created, but never mind that \u2013 this is the worst thing ever! Also, you must ignore the fact that the original movie scene the meme was based upon featured the hero massacring a church full of conservative Christians in Kentucky.\n\nWeird how that realistic cinematic bloodletting matched the seething hatred of traditional Americans we\u2019ve come to expect from our poisonous popular culture, but the Blue Check Mafia has an explanation about why the Christian slaughter was A-OK. See, in the movie, Beanie and Cecil had a magic crystal and the mind control lasers made it so Zippy and Zoopy were actually good guys and shooting a bunch of Jesus people actually means we love Christians and stuff and don\u2019t you see that when they shoot a church full of Christians it doesn\u2019t mean they are shooting Christians, and that if you think it does you are craaaaaazzzzzyyyyyyy? Just don\u2019t pay attention to the real violence outside Trump\u2019s Minneapolis rally.\n\nIt\u2019s bad enough that they lie to us, directly and by omission, all the time. But what makes it worse is how their lies are such glaringly obvious fabrications and/or dissimulations that the deepest insult is that they think we might believe them.\n\nSure, our elite is smoldering garbage, but what if it held unchallenged power? It would be a whole country that is Scat Francisco. See the nightmare play out in my action-packed yet hilarious novels of America torn apart by liberal malice, People's Republic, Indian Country and Wildfire (plus Book Number IV comes out this November)!
