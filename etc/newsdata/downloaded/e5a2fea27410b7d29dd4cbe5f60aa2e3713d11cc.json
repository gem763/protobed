(Picture: BACKGRID/Bettmann)\n\nJudy, the new Judy Garland biopic, based on the Olivier- and Tony-nominated West End and Broadway play End of the Rainbow by Peter Quilter came out on 4 October.\n\nJudy Garland\u2019s daughter (and icon in her own right) Liza with a Z thinks the film will tarnish her mum\u2019s reputation.\n\nStar of the movie \u2013 receiving widespread acclaim and Oscar buzz \u2013 Renee Zellweger insists the film is an \u2018act of celebration of her humanity and courage and legacy.\u2019\n\nBut just exactly how much of the film is true, and how much of it has been plucked from over the rainbow?\n\nWhat\u2019s true in the new Judy Garland film?\n\nLiza and Judy \u2013 a mother/daugher duo made over the rainbow (Picture: Getty)\n\n**Some mild spoilers for the movie ahead**\n\nWell, generally most of the facts and timelines are accurate.\n\nJudy Garland in London\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJudy did perform in London six months prior to her death, with a five week engagement at the Talk of the Town \u2013 which still stands today in London\u2019s Leicester Square as the Hippodrome.\n\nSome artistic liberties were taken about the engagement, though.\n\nIn the movie, Judy doesn\u2019t finish her run, being replaced by musician Lonnie Donegan. This never happened. Judy did finish her run of performances.\n\nJudy Garland and Mickey Deans\n\nShe also did marry Mickey Deans, as she does in the film, though the timeline was slightly different.\n\nIn real life, she didn\u2019t divorce her fourth husband Mark Herron, who isn\u2019t featured in the film at all, until February 1969, marrying Mickey in March, just three months before she died in June.\n\nJudy Garland and Rosalyn Wilder\n\nA major character in the movie is her assistant/handler Rosalyn, played in the movie by Jessie Buckley.\n\nShe is real and she did assist Judy during her engagement in London \u2013 and she\u2019s still alive to talk about it.\n\nRosalyn recently sat down with the L.A. Times to talk about her involvement in the new movie.\n\nShe is quoted as saying: \u2018I think the film is a very good representation of what went on and how it went on.\u2019\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a film. It\u2019s a biopic. It\u2019s not meant to be a day-by-day, minute-by-minute, blow-by-blow account of what happened. But I think it\u2019s a very good representation.\u2019\n\nRenee Zellweger\u2019s Judy had to be put in clothes and forced on stage by Rosalyn in the movie, but this didn\u2019t happen, according to real-life Rosalyn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJudy Garland and her gay fans\n\nSadly for anyone who has already seen it, the touching moment with her gay fans is fictionalised for the film.\n\nIn the movie, a lonely Judy goes back to the flat of two of her gay fans who have waited outside the stage door to see her.\n\nThey sing, eat and discuss what life was like being scrutinized and judged \u2013 back when homosexuality was illegal for the men and growing up under the harsh studio system for Judy.\n\nIn one of the most moving moments of the film, the two gay men start a rousing singalong of Over the Rainbow after Renee\u2019s Judy is too emotional to go on.\n\nJudy Garland and Louis B Mayer\n\nJudy spoke candidly throughout much of her later years about the cruel upbringing she had through the Hollywood studio system, and particularly MGM boss Louis B. Mayer.\n\nThere are many stories of the sleazy underbelly of Hollywood\u2019s Golden Age, which makes the #MeToo movement even more gratifying.\n\nMORE: Renee Zellweger defends Judy Garland biopic as Liza Minnelli says it will \u2018tarnish\u2019 star\u2019s reputation\n\nMORE: Ren\u00e9e Zellweger opens up about about the pressures of being a woman in Hollywood ahead of Judy Garland biopic", "description": "Renee Zellweger is Judy Garland in the new Judy film.
