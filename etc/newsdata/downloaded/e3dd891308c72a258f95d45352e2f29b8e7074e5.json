The MAX has been grounded, Airbus are pricing up, Boeing are pricing up because they\u2019ve nothing to sell.\u201d\n\nIndustry sources say Ryanair has begun commercial talks with Boeing over an order for a larger MAX variant that could be finalised once the current version returns to service.\n\nThe price of the potential 737 MAX 10 order is expected to include sharper discounts in lieu of cash compensation for the grounding of the older variants, the sources have said.\n\nRyanair has said it is interested in 100 Airbus A321neo aircraft for its recently acquired Laudamotion business and the 737 MAX 10 for its all-Boeing main fleet \u201cat the right price\u201d. But O\u2019Leary said the talks with Airbus were going slowly.\n\nWhile Laudamotion provided a platform to acquire Airbus planes into the Ryanair Group, the MAX grounding has not caused him to reconsider his policy of running just one aircraft type per airline, he said.\n\nRyanair has 135 of a special 197-seat version of Boeing\u2019s grounded 737 MAX 8 planes on order and options for a further 75. The Boeing 737 MAX 10 is expected to have up to 230 seats.\n\nOn Tuesday O\u2019Leary said Ryanair is in \u201ccontinuous dialogue\u201d with Boeing in the hope that 30-40 737 MAX jets could be operational by summer 2020, assuming the plane is cleared to return to service by the end of this year or soon after.\n\nRyanair recently lowered the target for next year to 30 from 58 because of the delays caused by the grounding of the MAX fleet after two fatal crashes that killed 346 people.\n\nBefore the MAX can return to service, U.S. and European aviation authorities need to approve software and training changes proposed by Boeing.\n\nCONSOLIDATION COMING?\n\nA likely proliferation of European environmental taxes will eventually force more carriers out of business, O\u2019Leary also predicted on Tuesday, while condemning proposals that would force low-cost carriers to bear the brunt of increased levies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to hasten the consolidation of the industry,\u201d O\u2019Leary said.\n\nGovernments including France and the Netherlands are introducing new airline taxes or considering doing so, with exemptions for connecting flights in a move that would help traditional network carriers such as Air France-KLM (AIRF.PA).\n\nGermany, meanwhile, is considering imposing minimum ticket prices that would punish low-cost operators.\n\nRyanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary speaks during a Reuters Newsmaker event in London, Britain October 1, 2019. REUTERS/Peter Nicholls\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t exempt connecting transfer traffic from environmental taxes,\u201d O\u2019Leary said, adding that such flights represent the most environmentally damaging traffic because they involve two flights to reach their destination.\n\nLow-cost carriers account for a large share of Europe\u2019s recent and expected aviation emissions growth, but Ryanair\u2019s high load factors allow it to report lower carbon output than full-service rivals on a per-passenger basis.\n\n\u201cAs we cram you all in together, you can take comfort from the fact that you\u2019re having the least impact on the environment of any passenger airline group in Europe,\u201d O\u2019Leary said.", "description": "Ryanair can wait out price rises sought by planemakers since the global grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX, the Irish airline's boss said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Laurence Frost", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435894462&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF902UW", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
