And in April, the department sanctioned Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska and his aluminum company Rusal.\n\nAccording to those sources, Treasury broke protocol and did not coordinate closely with other departments to properly scrutinize Deripaska and evaluate the impact of the sanctions\u2014which roiled global markets and caused aluminum prices to skyrocket, mainly affecting U.S. partners in Europe.\n\nNow, Mnuchin is backpedaling and considering lifting the sanctions, although Treasury officials deny that they didn\u2019t understand what punishing Deripaska would cause.\n\nThe about-face is one example of what more than a dozen lawmakers and current and former U.S. officials described as an administration beset by incessant communication breakdowns.\n\nNearly two years after the 2016 transition\u2014when dozens of staffers involved in sanctions left the government\u2014the inter-agency process to draft, implement and enforce sanctions is \u201cbroken\u201d and a \u201ccomplete mess,\u201d said a congressional source who works directly with the Trump administration on the issue.\n\n\u201c There\u2019s a civil war inside the administration over Russia policy. \u201d \u2014 Sen. Chris Murphy\n\nThe Rusal mishap exacerbated a four-year debate, spanning two administrations, about how far to go in punishing Russia\u2014for its annexation of Crimea, military interventions in Syria and meddling in U.S. elections.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a civil war inside the administration over Russia policy,\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in an interview. \u201cThere are some really strong voices in the State Department that want us to push back more on Russia, that want the president to use the sanctions policies. But they\u2019re fighting the president.\u201d\n\nThe current sanctions regime has done little, if anything, to change Russian behavior, lawmakers told The Daily Beast. And the Trump administration has not developed a cohesive strategy to protect U.S. national security interests from the growing threat emanating from the Kremlin.\n\n\u201cWhy are we letting them push us around? How are they getting away with this?\u201d Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI), who recently returned from a trip to Moscow with some colleagues, said in an interview. \u201cI think we just really don\u2019t have the kind of confident response or coordinated response.\u201d\n\nNow, with increasing evidence that Russia is actively interfering in U.S. electoral politics, the White House must make a major decision: continue using a light touch to keep Moscow at bay, or side with growing majorities in Congress to deal a major blow to the Russian economy.\n\n\u201c Why are we letting them push us around? How are they getting away with this? \u201d \u2014 Sen. Ron Johnson\n\nHarsher sanctions might catapult U.S.-Russian relations into an uncertain future and change the way dozens of countries conduct international trade, officials said. New financial penalties could also adversely impact U.S. allies in Europe, where relations are already strained due to Trump\u2019s tariff policies and his attacks on the NATO alliance. Many of those nations rely on Russian natural gas imports, which Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-AK) described to The Daily Beast as Putin\u2019s \u201chuge geo-strategic weapon.\u201d They also rely on existing contracts with Rusal, and European leaders have appealed directly to the Trump administration in light of the Deripaska sanctions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really fine line the administration is walking here,\u201d said one former senior Treasury official. \u201cIf the administration goes too far with sanctions it risks not being able to walk things back. But if the sanctions aren\u2019t harsh enough Russia will continue to find ways to meddle.\u201d\n\nLast week, the White House attempted to assuage some of those concerns when President Donald Trump signed an executive order to sanction foreigners who interfere in American elections. But officials across the government are skeptical.\n\nThe order will do little to alter Russia\u2019s economy and prevent the Kremlin from interfering in the 2018 elections, current and former U.S. officials told The Daily Beast. That\u2019s because it did not designate specific Russian entities or individuals for sanctions. Instead, it laid out a plan to sanction foreigners who are determined to have interfered in future American elections\u2014a process that largely already exists.\n\n\u201cAn executive order is very limited in what it can do,\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), who co-authored a sanctions bill of his own, said in an interview. \u201cSo I don\u2019t think it does anything to take away the need to have a deterrence mechanism into law.\u201d\n\nWith the 2018 elections rapidly approaching, lawmakers want to move quickly on legislation that would sanction Russia harder than ever before.\n\nBut their efforts are being stymied by a White House that is desperately trying to maintain the image that the U.S. is on a path to restoring relations with the Kremlin, current and former officials said. While Trump has taken some actions against Putin, such as expelling Russian diplomats and arming the Ukrainians, members of his national security team worry that unreasonably tough sanctions will irreparably damage its relationship with the Kremlin\u2014a view shared by President Barack Obama during his time in office.\n\n\u201c Putin makes complaints about the sanctions in the press to make headlines, but really they aren\u2019t hurting Russia in a way everyone thought they might. \u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in Russia, many are worried about future U.S. sanctions. Some of the Republican lawmakers who joined Johnson in Moscow told The Daily Beast that the Russians seemed fixated on what\u2019s to come.\n\nEconomists in Moscow say the Russian government has implemented measures to insulate the economy from sanctions, which is growing at a steady, if relatively low, pace.\n\n\u201cThe Kremlin doesn\u2019t really care about sanctions,\u201d one source with first-hand knowledge of the Russian international economic strategy told The Daily Beast. \u201cPutin makes complaints about the sanctions in the press to make headlines but really they aren\u2019t hurting Russia in a way everyone thought they might.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, Obama and his national security team sat down to devise a roadmap for condemning Russia for its annexation of Crimea. The result was a plan to sanction Russia to the point that it questioned its potential for growth but still allowed the U.S. and other countries to continue trading with the country, three people involved in those discussions told The Daily Beast. One former Treasury official called it a \u201ccrazy Frankenstein monster version of sanctions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe concern was these state entities were too big and that the collateral consequences to us and obviously to our European allies even more so would be too great if we went with the Iran model and we just tried to shut the place down,\u201d an ex-Treasury official said.\n\nAt a Senate Banking Committee hearing last week, Daleep Singh, the former acting assistant secretary of the Treasury Department, said he was \u201ccautious\u201d about sanctioning Russian sovereign debt in 2014 because \u201cit would harm us reputationally if we were seen as intentionally provoking a full-fledged crisis in Russia.\u201d Yet Congress is now considering sanctioning Russian sovereign debt as a way to deal a decisive blow to the Kremlin\u2014and its economy.\n\nWhat the Obama administration really wanted to do, former officials said, was force Russia to change its behavior militarily and diplomatically. But the sanctions ended up not having \u201cany real magnitude,\u201d a former State Department official conceded.\n\nThat can largely be attributed to the lack of exacting language in the sectoral sanctions, one section of the overall regime, making it easy for Russian entities to continue to conduct business as usual so long as they followed certain guidelines, officials told The Daily Beast.\n\nWhile the Obama administration continued to roll out sanctions against Russia, word began to spread throughout the intelligence community in the fall of 2016 that the newly elected president, Trump, wanted to change course, current and former officials in the Treasury and State departments said. Trump reportedly ordered staffers at State to develop a plan to roll back Russian sanctions.\n\n\u201cSanctions were still in place, but it was definitely a confusing time and no one was sure what would happen under the new administration,\u201d one former senior Treasury official said.\n\nThat confusion carried over into the early days of the Trump presidency, officials said, as the White House took a vastly different stance against Russia, promising the return of normal diplomatic relations and increased partnerships on the world stage.\n\n\u201c They routinely shiv us when we try to press for even the most basic information about their compliance. \u201d\n\nToday, members of Congress are scrambling to correct what they view as an insufficient sanctions regime and set the U.S. on a path toward gaining leverage over Russia. The soul-searching comes a year after lawmakers crafted and passed a biting sanctions package primarily targeting Russia\u2019s defense and intelligence sectors.\n\nIn recent hearings, senators have been evaluating the effectiveness of existing sanctions and considering what more can be done. Lawmakers have also introduced two bipartisan proposals that have not advanced out of committees or onto the Senate floor. One, written by Sens. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC), would immediately sanction the Russian energy sector and its sovereign debt. Another, crafted by Rubio and Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), would trigger energy sanctions only when the director of national intelligence determines that a foreign actor has attempted to interfere in an American election.\n\nBehind the scenes, lawmakers are venting to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), according to interviews with a dozen lawmakers and aides directly involved in the negotiations over a new sanctions package. They claim that McConnell hasn\u2019t prioritized the issue. Other members, particularly the president\u2019s closest allies, have argued against those bills because they would take too much discretion away from Trump.\n\nBut over the past year and a half, Congress has balked at presidential discretion on sanctions, underscoring lawmakers\u2019 distrust of the administration\u2019s\u2014and the president\u2019s\u2014posture toward Russia. In announcing the executive order Wednesday, national security adviser John Bolton said the president needs \u201cfull waiver authority,\u201d revealing that a key motivation behind the order was to circumvent Congress.\n\nLawmakers and Capitol Hill aides have long lamented what they view as a complete breakdown in communication with the Trump administration, particularly when it comes to sanctions enforcement. Republicans and Democrats alike have accused top officials of leaving them in the dark on key elements of foreign policy, national security, and the safeguarding of American elections.\n\n\u201cThey routinely shiv us when we try to press for even the most basic information about their compliance with the [sanctions laws],\u201d said a congressional aide who works directly in sanctions policy.\n\nLast summer, the House and Senate passed with overwhelming bipartisan majorities a tough Russia sanctions regime that gave the administration little discretion on implementation. Democrats and Republicans have been engaged in a heated, months-long back-and-forth with the administration over what they view as its unwillingness to fully implement the Countering America\u2019s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). And instead of fully implementing it, the White House has relied on previous executive orders, some of which were issued by Obama.\n\nMurphy said plenty of Trump administration officials are in favor of implementing tough measures against Russia. However, there\u2019s no telling when\u2014or if\u2014the White House will act on their recommendations, he said.\n\n\u201cThere will be these breakthrough moments where the White House listens to the\u2026 hardliners. But it\u2019s really hard to predict when those moments are going to come and whether they\u2019re going to last,\u201d Murphy told The Daily Beast.\n\nWith the midterm elections less than two months away, there remains an overwhelming desire on Capitol Hill to move forward with legislation that complements Trump\u2019s executive order and punishes Russia. But senators spearheading those efforts are warning that the window is closing for Congress to act.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t do anything by the end of September, then we probably won\u2019t do anything,\u201d Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN), the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in an interview. \u201cI do have the concern of us doing something that\u2019s cutting our own nose off to spite our face.\u201d", "description": "A slip of the tongue at a congressional hearing forced Treasury officials to scramble to come up with a sanctions plan to match what was said.", "authors": ["Erin Banco", "Andrew Desiderio", "National Security Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1125,w_2000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1537310066/180914-banco-desiderio-russia-sanctions-hero_xhg9vd", "published_at": "2018-09-19"}
