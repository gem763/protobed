William McRaven, former chief of the U.S. Special Operations Command, said it may be time for the U.S. to get a new president, since President Donald Trump is not a capable leader.\n\n\u201cThe America that they believed in was under attack, not from without, but from within.\u201d Retired Adm. William McRaven\n\nMcRaven said he was struck by the men and women who serve \u2014 and have served \u2014 America who he said now harbor \u201can underlying current of frustration, humiliation, anger and fear\u201d because of Trumps\u2019s words and deeds.\n\n\u201cAs I stood on the parade field at Fort Bragg, one retired four-star general, grabbed my arm, shook me and shouted, \u2018I don\u2019t like the Democrats, but Trump is destroying the Republic!\u2019\u201d he wrote.\n\nMcRaven said America\u2019s greatness is reflected in its ideals. \u201cWe are the most powerful nation in the world because our ideals of universal freedom and equality have been backed up by our belief that we were champions of justice, the protectors of the less fortunate.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Trump seems to believe that these qualities are unimportant or show weakness. He is wrong,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd if this president doesn\u2019t understand their importance, if this president doesn\u2019t demonstrate the leadership that America needs, both domestically and abroad, then it is time for a new person in the Oval Office \u2014 Republican, Democrat or independent \u2014 the sooner, the better. The fate of our Republic depends upon it.\u201d\n\nMcRaven has been an outspoken critic of Trump, and said last year that Trump\u2019s attacks on the press represented \u201cthe greatest threat to democracy.\u201d\n\nTrump dismissed that criticism last November, calling McRaven a supporter of former President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, and saying it \u201cwould it have been nicer if we got Osama bin Laden a lot sooner than that.\u201d", "description": "The U.S. commander who oversaw the raid that killed Osama bin Laden says the U.S. is under attack again \u2014 \u201cbut from within,\u201d and it\u2019s the president doing it.", "authors": ["Mike Murphy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT570_mcrave_ZG_20191017202418.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
