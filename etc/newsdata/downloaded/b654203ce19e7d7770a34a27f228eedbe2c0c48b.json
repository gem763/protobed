The area is ignored by cruiseship tourists but was a bull's eye for Dorian's 200-plus mph winds.\n\nThe Peace River K9 Search and Rescue Association arrived on the island of Grand Bahama last weekend in hopes of finding the hundreds still missing in the aftermath of Hurricane Dorian\n\nThe team is the first cadaver-sniffing dog team to be dispatched to a hurricane-ravaged area. Above shepherd dog Caliber Von Telos 'Cali' relaxes with its handler Julie Starbuck\n\nThe crew arrived on the Bahamas Relief Cruise, one of the primary groups bringing aid to the country. A member of the Royal Bahamas Police is seen petting a K9 as they prepare for their mission\n\nFour-legged heroes: The highly-trained dogs can only work 30 minutes in the sweltering Bahamian heat before they require rest\n\nDuring their three-day mission, the Peace River K-9 Search and Rescue Association crew worked tirelessly from sunrise to sunset in the heat to find the missing bodies of the hurricane victims who otherwise may never be found, in hopes of bringing closure to families.\n\nAs of September, the Category 5 storm is estimated to have caused $7billion in damage, claimed the lives of at least 58 people and 600 are still missing.\n\nBy now, Dorian's missing victims are assumed to have been lost as sea when the Atlantic surged across thin bands of land like a tsunami.\n\nYet, here and there, locals who are rebuilding the island have reported to authorities that human corpses may still be buried under piles of debris.\n\nThe Peace River K-9 Search and Rescue Association is the first cadaver-sniffing dog unit to be dispatched to a hurricane-ravaged area.\n\n'We would have preferred coming here two or three weeks ago,' team leader Michael Hadsell, 61, a former Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputy now living in Sarasota, Florida, told DailyMailTV.\n\n'With this rescue effort there was a lot of politics involved, and we're only getting here a month after the hurricane hit,' Hadsell said as he disembarked from the cruise-ship Grand Celebration with his four-year-old black German Shepherd Damma in Freeport on Saturday.\n\nK9 Nelson and handler Nadja Hoffman search through debris for missing Bahamians in McLean's Town, Grand Bahama. The settlement is more than an hour east of Freeport and was a bull's eye for Dorian's 200-plus mph winds\n\nCadaver dogs are trained with real body parts, and at times, full corpses buried in scientific research stations known as 'body farms.' Handlers Tim Thiel and Nadja Hoffman are pictured in their search with K9 Nelson\n\nDuring their three-day mission, the Peace River K-9 Search and Rescue Association crew worked tirelessly from sunrise to sunset in the heat to find the missing bodies of the hurricane victims\n\nK9 Search And Rescue Association team members Holi Fleming, Julie Starbuck and K9 Caliber Von Telos 'Cali' walk through rubble\n\nAs of September, the Category 5 storm is estimated to have cause $7billion in damage, claimed the lives of at least 58 people and 600 are still missing. Above, Cali sniffs for human scent through rubble\n\nNow the CEO of a label-printing business, Hadsell also has more than 40 years of K-9 tracking expertise that has taken him and his dogs to crime scenes like the search for Casey Anthony's slain daughter Caylee in 2008, and disaster zones such as the 2010 Haiti earthquake.\n\nTeam leader Michael Hadsell, 61, who lives in Sarasota, Florida, said the crew hopes to bring closure to families of missing people\n\n'It's a shame. Maybe we could've found some people still alive. At this point, our mission is clearly to recover bodies.'\n\nWhen asked why he and his crew agreed to take on such a heavy task, he said: 'Because no one else will do it. We just want to allow families to get closure. Family members of folks who disappear have a big hole in their lives. We're here to fill that hole the best we can.'\n\nStephanie Hollingsworth, an IT tech by day, was dispatched to the hard-hit High Rock settlement with Shay, a Belgian Malinois she rescued in Tennessee and is now certified in tracking and human remains detection.\n\nAs the two rode in the back of a police pickup truck passing by forest fires sparked by dried vegetation by salt waters, Shay became uneasy when they approached a decimated settlement.\n\nSeventeen people are still missing from the three-street settlement, including a dad and his three children.\n\n'She's a good dog,' said Hollingsworth. 'She started showing an interest in tracking as soon as I got her. She's got a real drive to find them.'\n\nThe dog-human duo were asked to find the traces of Clarence Jones, a disabled 65-year-old man who tried to brave the storm in a two-bedroom house he shared with his brother, Ronald Smith.\n\nLocals who are rebuilding the island have reported to authorities that human corpses may still be buried under piles of debris\n\nRonald Smith (pictured) says his brother Clarence Jones, 65, was swept away by the storm while he went out to try to find help. He is seen standing where their home once stood. Smith survived by hanging on to a tree\n\nLarge chunks of the outside wall now covered the area where his bed had been, an area now in open air after the roof was blown up\n\nK9 Shay searches through the debris where a missing man was last seen before Hurricane Dorian ravaged the area\n\nK9 Caliber Von Telos 'Cali' lies down atop debris, which is a signal that human remains are beneath or nearby\n\nSmith was sweeping the floor in the destroyed home when the crew arrived.\n\n'I think my brother was pulled away by the ocean,' he told DailyMail.com. 'He was in a wheelchair and used a walker after he suffered a stroke. He didn't want to evacuate so I stayed with him.\n\n'I lost track of him when the water came rushing into the house. I tried to get on the roof but I wasn't able to, and I couldn't get to him. The beach is just 350 feet away, and the surge picked me up and started taking me toward the ocean.\n\n'I managed to grab a branch from a pine tree and I had to stay in the tree for five hours until morning. I got rescued by neighbors. By the time I went back to the house, my brother was gone.\n\n'I have no idea where he is.'\n\nHollingsworth let two-year-old Shay off her leash in what once was Jones's bedroom.\n\nLarge chunks of the outside wall now covered the area where his bed had been, an area now in open air after the roof was blown up. His red wheelchair was neatly stored in a corner, as if Jones would use it again.\n\n'We can only let our dogs work for 30 minutes in this heat,' Hollingsworth said. 'We have a limited time before they need a rest.'\n\nShay started on top of the collapsed wall, moving around to the bathroom, past the flipped-up toilet and bare PVC pipes where there once was a sink.\n\nShe slid effortlessly, her back crouched down, from one destroyed room to another, before it became clear Jones's body wasn't there.\n\nCrew member Stephanie Hollingsworth cradles Shay as the team drives past forest fires sparked by dried out vegetation due to saltwater floods\n\nShay, a Belgian Malinois Hollingsworth rescued in Tennessee, became uneasy when they approached the street\n\nAn area which was once lined with trees and greenery is now decimated and dried out as fires continue to burn\n\nBy the time they embarked on their trip home on Monday, the search and rescue team had no idea how many bodies the dogs had found because the dogs can only detect the scent of decay and leave the excavation work up to the police\n\nWith the handler behind her, Shay she headed into the backyard and adjacent woods.\n\nThere were signs of sudden flooding there too, mostly mountain-sized piles of vegetation, tree limbs and brush.\n\nAfter sniffing around a mount of debris she lied down near a large branch and looked up at her handler to signal she found something.\n\nFaint at first, the distinct smell of a rotting human flesh rose from underneath the debris as bystanders started removing some branches.\n\nHollingsworth eventually marked the spot with yellow tape so that authorities could recover later what appeared to be a body.\n\nWith the clock ticking, Shay and the team moved to another house in the countryside where the owner was among the missing.\n\nShay couldn't track the scent of a dead human within a 300-foot radius. Panting as if she'd run a marathon, her shift was over and another dog was brought in.\n\nBrown Labrador Nelson and shepherds Caliber Von Telos and Eli were taken to debris fields about a mile wide formed when the floods returned to the ocean, far away from any settlement.\n\nThere, among pieces of roofs and walls and bricks intermingled with dead tree limbs, yellow markers went up as the dogs picked up human scents.\n\nThe crew are seen working to remove dead leaves, trees, and debris after Shay detected a human scent\n\nThe team later came across a gruesome discovery when they found a dead dog buried beneath the rubble\n\nFreeing up corpses or body parts, however, require a backhoe, something that's at a premium in a disaster area and could take days to find.\n\nBy the time its members embarked for the trip home on Monday, the search and rescue team had no idea how many bodies the dogs had found because the animals only detect human decomposition and leave the excavation work to the police.\n\n'Local authorities with heavy machinery are scheduled to dig this week,' team member Tim Thiel said.\n\n'All the dogs know is that they find decaying human stuff. Whether it's a full body, an arm or a drop of blood, it's up to the Bahamian police to figure it out. But we can pretty much guarantee you that wherever the dogs sat or signaled, there's something there.'\n\nCadaver dogs, said Thiel, a former New Jersey police officer turned private investigator, are trained with real body parts, and at times, full corpses buried in scientific research stations known as 'body farms.'\n\n'Old teeth work really well,' Thiel says. 'We'll have the dog search woods for teeth we put in the ground. Blood works well, too. We've got a box with some body parts and blood.\n\n'But because dogs need to be familiar with all of the stages of decomposition, we prefer body farms.'\n\nAs for their reward for all their hard work, the dogs are given tasty treats or toys they can tug on like a piece of rope, or a ball.\n\nCleveland Deamesc, Lamonte Farrington and Theresa Martinborough, of the Royal Bahamas Police K9 unit, assist the Peace River K9 Search And Rescue Association\n\nAs for their reward for all their hard work, the dogs are given tasty treats or toys they can tug on like a piece of rope, or a ball. Above K9s Eli and Nelson (right) are seen boarding the cruiseship with their handlers\n\nThe dogs, which are household pets on a regular day, are trained to become so good at their job that they can find a single drop of blood shed months ago\n\nK9 Labrador Retriever Nelson takes a break in McLean's Town\n\nTeam leader Hadsell said the dogs eventually become so good at their job that they can find a single drop of blood shed months ago.\n\n'I did the search of a slaughterhouse for a bloody knife used in a murder,' Hasdell said. 'And my dog stepped over piece of dead animals to go straight for the knife.'\n\nDogs of any breed, Hadsell added, can be trained.\n\n'We've got a terrier who is nationally certified,' he said. 'She is too little to bring on this mission, but she can get into nooks and crannies no other dog is able to get in.'\n\nWith such a gruesome task, the dog handlers, too, need support beyond recognizing their dogs' signals.\n\nThe team's chaplain Tony Ledbetter, a Baptist preacher from Indiana, Ledbetter stood by as the dogs sniffed their ways through destroyed homes.\n\n'My burden is to help the team deal with finding and handling corpses,' Ledbetter said. 'There is a lot of stress involved that can lead to PTSD. I try to take that off their shoulders.'\n\nThe presence of the non-profit Peace River Search and Rescue Association's team over the weekend wasn't a part of a government effort from either the United States or the Bahamas.\n\nAs a matter of fact, team members ended up spending their own money on dog food, equipment and some of the traveling expenses in additional to missing days of work.\n\nStill, the crew came as part of a private initiative where a West Palm Beach charity run by a group of restaurant owners, the Bahamas Relief Cruise, has been using regularly-scheduled cruises from the Port of Palm Beach to ship volunteers, food, medical supplies and workers, construction material and contractors to the island.\n\n'The Bahamas Relief Cruise was able to successfully board all handlers, support staff and K-9s onto the ship, host them with hotel accommodations and guide them to where cadaver search and rescue need was identified on a previous mission,' the relief group said in a statement.\n\n\n\n", "description": "DailyMailTV joined the Peace River K9 Search and Rescue Association in Grand Bahama as it carried out search missions across the island where hundreds are still missing.", "authors": ["Jose Lambiet In The Bahamas For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/17/19307114-0-image-a-28_1570207760708.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
