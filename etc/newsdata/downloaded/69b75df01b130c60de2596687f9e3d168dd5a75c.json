A team led by Stanford University scientists has created an AI that can swap the facial movements of a person in one video to the subject of another. The AI works by first analysing the intricate facial movements of a target, whose likeness will be used in the fake video. It picks out the target's head tilts, eye motion, mouth details, blinks and learns their typical movements. The software then analyses these same landmarks on a face in a source video - the one whose movements will be swapped to the target. After it captures the nuanced facial movements of the source, the AI reproduces them using the target's own, natural expressions. This creates a strikingly realistic fake clip because the target's normal face movements and ticks are emulated. The AI learns using an Adverserial Neural Network, a relatively new type of AI that rapidly trains itself to recognise patterns in data. Two AIs are pitched against one another, one to create, the other to analyse, in a string of millions of back-and-forth adjustments. This makes the learning process quicker and more accurate than if a human were to analyse each of the AI's attempts.\n\nOver the summer, DeepNude, an AI-driven app that created fake nude images of women based on real photos, became unexpectedly popular.\n\nThe app creator pulled the app after being widely criticized, but clones of the app are still easily accessible.\n\nImages created by an AI show how deepfake technology can be convincingly used in any medium, from photography to oil painting.\n\nIn July, the House of Representatives considered federal measures to ban deepfake videos.\n\n'Now is the time for social media companies to put in place policies to protect users from this kind of misinformation not in 2021 after viral deepfakes have polluted the 2020 elections. By then it will be too late,' Adam Schiff said during a July hearing on deepfakes.", "description": "Deepfake videos have quickly become a scourge of the internet, something a new California bill seeks to combat by making it illegal to create deepfake porn without acquiring the subject's consent.", "authors": ["Michael Thomsen For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/18/19407400-0-image-a-6_1570470641908.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
