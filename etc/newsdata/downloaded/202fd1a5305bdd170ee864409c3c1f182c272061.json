He sat on his mother's lap while his father chatted with Tutu, video footage showed.\n\nThe family met Tutu and his daughter Thandeka at the Old Granary, one of the oldest buildings in Cape Town, where the cleric's charitable foundation is based.\n\nA small group of well-wishers waited in searing heat to catch a glimpse of the royals arriving at the Old Granary. One elderly woman collapsed and had to be moved to the shade where bystanders and police officers helped her.\n\nThe couple were presented with a basket of gifts from the Tutu family celebrating South African women, children and non-racialism including matching hand-made beaded bracelets in the foundations colours, a signed set of children's books for Archie written by Tutu, and a signed copy of the \"Book of Joy\" written jointly by the Dalai Lama and the archbishop.\n\nPrince Harry was also presented with a pair of framed photographs, one for him and the other for his brother Prince William, of their late mother Princess Diana\u2019s meeting with President Nelson Mandela in Cape Town in 1997.\n\nTutu, who as Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town used the pulpit to preach against the injustices of white minority rule during the apartheid era, has battled prostate cancer for years and has largely withdrawn from public life.\n\nThe Desmond & Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation aims to preserve his legacy by helping youth and promoting leadership skills.\n\nLater in the day Meghan met officials and entrepreneurs of a British-South African tech hub which trains and supports female entrepreneurs. She then headed to the nonprofit organization mothers2mothers, which works to prevent mother-to-child transmissions of HIV/Aids. South Africa has one of the world\u2019s highest rates of HIV prevalence.\n\nThe Duchess of Sussex was greeted by cheers from crowds outside the multi-storey building with many onlookers leaning out of windows to catch a glimpse of her in a sleeveless dark blue jumpsuit.\n\nMeghan briefly stopped to speak to a group of children waiting to present her with flowers and a drawing.\n\nHarry, Queen Elizabeth's grandson and sixth in line to the British throne, has been visiting southern Africa for two decades for holidays and conservation work.\n\nHe will travel alone on Thursday to Botswana, where he and Meghan holidayed shortly after they began dating in July 2016 and returned to in 2017 for a romantic getaway.\n\nHarry then heads to Angola, visiting the landmine clearance project which Princess Diana also visited during her campaign to ban landmines. He ends the solo part of his tour in Malawi, where he will meet President Peter Mutharika.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Wendell Roelf; editing by Gareth Jones and Angus MacSwan)", "description": "Nobel Peace Prize laureate Desmond Tutu hailed Britain's Prince Harry and his wife Meghan as \"genuinely caring\" people when the royal couple visited the former archbishop along with their four-month-old son Archie in Cape Town on Wednesday.
