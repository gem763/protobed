Ambassador Sondland traveled to Washington from Brussels in order to prepare for his testimony and to be available to answer the Committee\u2019s questions.\u201d\n\nThe State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThough Sondland, through his lawyer, expressed hope that he would still be permitted to testify, the move to block his appearance is an indication that the Trump administration is continuing efforts to prevent officials from cooperating with any congressional inquiries. Democrats have already indicated they consider these efforts to be evidence of obstruction.\n\nTrump on Tuesday defended the decision to block Sondland from appearing before House investigators.\n\n\"I would love to send Ambassador Sondland, a really good man and great American, to testify, but unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court, where Republican\u2019s rights have been taken away, and true facts are not allowed out for the public to see,\" Trump tweeted.\n\nSondland, according to text messages provided to Congress by former U.S. representative to Ukraine Kurt Volker, appeared to be involved in discussions surrounding a potential September White House visit for newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u2014 as well as discussions about withholding that visit amid efforts by Trump to press Zelensky to investigate the Bidens for dealings in Ukraine.\n\nIn the exchange, Sondland denied the existence of a quid pro quo, but he also said Trump appeared focused on achieving a \u201cdeliverable\u201d before agreeing to meet with Zelensky. The text chain also included discussion of whether military aid was being withheld from Ukraine to force Zelensky to comply.\n\nTrump, in his tweets on Tuesday morning, highlighted the text in which Sondland denied an extortion attempt.\n\n\"Importantly, Ambassador Sondland\u2019s tweet, which few report, stated, 'I believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions. The President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind.' That says it ALL!\" Trump wrote.\n\nThe news that Sondland was being blocked from testifying came a day after two associates of Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani \u2014 who has spent months urging Ukraine to investigate the Bidens \u2014 also indicated they would not appear for scheduled depositions this week.\n\nDemocrats say moves to block their investigations by the White House could feed an obstruction of Congress article of impeachment against Trump, and the stonewalling also raises significant obstacles to unearthing new information about the allegations about Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukraine \u2014 a matter that has accelerated the House\u2019s drive toward impeachment.\n\nHouse Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff repeated that assertion Tuesday morning, speaking to reporters in the Capitol where he denounced the move. Schiff said the committee had been blindsided by Sondland's refusal to appear, telling reporters there were \"conversations well into yesterday afternoon and evening with the State Department legal adviser where there was no indication that this ambassador would be a no-show.\"\n\nThe chairman also ripped the State Department for withholding material Sondland had turned over, calling them \"deeply relevant\" to the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\"It is hard to overstate the significance of not just Ambassador Sondland's testimony and documents but the testimony of others as well. The failure to produce this witness, the failure to produce these documents, we consider yet additional strong evidence of obstruction of the constitutional functions of Congress, a co-equal branch of government,\" he said.", "description": "A central witness in House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump is refusing to appear for a deposition under orders from the State Department, his lawyer confirmed.
