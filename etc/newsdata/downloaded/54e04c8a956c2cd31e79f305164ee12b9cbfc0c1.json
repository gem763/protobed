Flooding is likely during high tide early Sunday morning. The high tide comes between 4 and 5 a.m. Sunday. When it comes to impacts, here\u2019s what they say:\n\n\u201cUp to one foot of inundation above ground level is possible. The unprotected area on the Southwest Waterfront at the DC Seafood Market may flood. Water may approach parts of the Hains Point Loop Road, but it will likely be closed. Water may approach buildings near King Street and Union Street.\u201d\n\nThe reason for this flooding is that water has piled up near the mouth of Chesapeake Bay because of winds from the north on Hurricane Dorian\u2019s backside. As this water returns up the Bay and into the Potomac, water levels are projected to rise.\n\nPollen update: Weed and grass pollen are moderate/high. Tree pollen and mold spores are low/moderate.\n\nWant our 5 a.m. forecast delivered to your email inbox?
