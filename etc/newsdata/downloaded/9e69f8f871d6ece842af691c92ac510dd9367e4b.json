It\u2019s like trying to put me next to an artist that\u2019s like John Mayer at the same time. The songs are completely worlds apart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Although we\u2019re boys of the same age, from a group where we were all the same, we started the same, there is that part of it\u2026 But then also the music is so different you can\u2019t really make a judgement.\u2019\n\nLiam admitted there was competition between the One Direction boys (Picture: Getty)\n\nWhile there might be \u2018competition\u2019 between them all, Liam revealed they are all still close friends.\n\nWhen asked if they had \u2018wished him well\u2019, the dad-of-one continued: \u2018Yeah, definitely. I speak to Louis all the time. Louis is great. He recently just put something out, which is great. He\u2019s doing really well.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve always had a good connection in the way we were trying to manage the band together. And that\u2019s followed through into life in that way. He\u2019s obviously been through a hell of a lot so I tried to be there for him as much as possible, and so does he, me.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s good to have someone who\u2019s been through the same [things] you have.\u2019\n\nLiam Payne and Louis Tomlinson have always remained close (Picture: Rex)\n\nLiam recently announced his debut album, aptly titled LP1, will be with us on 6 December.\n\nLifting the lid on what we can expect from his offering, the Bedroom Floor star explained it\u2019s a real mixed bag.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s a good mix of songs,\u2019 he said. \u2018There are some that are quite new age, some that are more like albums I used to listen to when I was a kid, like Usher 8701, Justified by Justin Timberlake, and it\u2019s an old school Chris Brown mix.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It\u2019s quite funny that they\u2019re the first albums I listened to as a kid.\n\n\u2018I mean, it was a little bit slow to start off with. I feel like, not in a cheesy way, but I got a little bit too close to the project. And I listened to everything so much that I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t even know whether this is good anymore. I\u2019ve got no parameter.\u201d\n\n\u2018So I gave it some time, and when I came back around to listen to it again, I was like, \u201cI think he\u2019s ready now.\u201d It just took a little bit of time.\u2019\n\nWell, 6 December can\u2019t come soon enough.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
