REUTERS/Simon Dawson\n\n1/BEGINNING OF THE END OR...\n\nBritain may be about to draw a line under almost 3-1/2 years of political chaos, economic uncertainty and tortuous discussions with the European Union over the terms of its exit from the bloc. If the UK parliament gives its nod to the divorce deal Prime Minister Johnson has secured \u2014 unlikely but possible \u2014 we might well see sterling rally more than 5%; shares in domestic-focused British companies might rocket to record highs.\n\nMarkets will be less euphoric if Johnson has to request an extension to the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline; it means three more months of Brexit noise, with a bitterly fought election likely thrown in. But with no-deal Brexit risks fading, the pullback may not be too drastic. Depending on the election outcome, Britain will either leave with Johnson\u2019s deal or hold a second referendum that may cancel Brexit altogether.\n\nBut if the Brexit battle does end, another one may commence \u2014 the race to negotiate long-term trade deals with the rest of the world. Johnson or his successor may find that even more tough going.\n\n- Brexit on a knife edge as PM Johnson stakes all on 'Super Saturday' vote\n\n- Britain's 'Super Saturday' Brexit showdown in parliament\n\nGRAPHIC: Sterling, UK focused shares rally - here\n\n2/\u201cSUPER MARIO\u201d LEAVES THE STAGE\n\nThursday could be an emotional day for Mario Draghi, the ECB chief credited with saving the euro and euro zone with his pledge in 2012 to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d.\n\nBig policy decisions are not anticipated at the European Central Bank\u2019s meeting given the sweeping easing steps unveiled in September. Instead it will largely be a goodbye to Draghi \u2014 whose eight-year term as president ends on Oct. 31.\n\nDubbed \u2018Super Mario\u2019, Draghi has restored confidence in the ECB\u2019s crisis-fighting ability and navigated the uncharted waters of quantitative easing (QE) \u2014 all in the face of fierce opposition from Germany and other conservative euro zone states.\n\nDraghi might feel a slight sense of disappointment though: Inflation remains well below the ECB\u2019s target of below but close to 2%, meaning he leaves office as the first ECB president to never raise interest rates. And the unprecedented stimulus implemented under his regime leaves his successor with little ammunition to combat another crisis.\n\nDraghi may use his last meeting to urge governments to use fiscal policy more effectively to boost growth and inflation. He\u2019s also likely to be pressed on the divisions within the ECB over restarting QE \u2014 but clearly healing that rift will be down to his successor, Christine Lagarde.\n\n- As Draghi leaves ECB, his opponents get chance to turn the tables\n\n- ECB's efforts to counter weak inflation will fail\n\n- Spend more if you want ECB to raise rates, Draghi tells governments\n\nGRAPHIC: Inflation, unemployment during the Draghi era - here\n\n3/TIME FOR TECH\n\nThird-quarter U.S. earnings season kicks into high gear in coming days \u2014 more than 130 S&P 500 companies and over one-third of the Dow industrials will be reporting results, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nReports flow in from many corners of Corporate America, from industrial bellwethers Boeing and Caterpillar to internet retailing titan Amazon.com. Biotech leaders Biogen and Gilead Sciences and carmaker Ford are among others to post results.\n\nInvestors have been bracing for gloom, but expectations have improved as early reports rolled in, and analysts now expect third-quarter earnings to fall by 2.9% from the prior year. That compares with a 3.2% drop expected a week ago, IBES data shows.\n\nBut the outlook doesn\u2019t seem to have improved for information technology, a sector comprising more than one-fifth of the S&P500 index. Here, Refinitiv data indicates earnings could drop by nearly 8% from a year earlier.\n\nAside from Amazon, Microsoft, the largest company by value, as well as semiconductor stalwarts Intel and Texas Instruments will post earnings as will payments processor Visa.\n\n- Tech haves and have-nots face third-quarter tests\n\nGRAPHIC: U.S. tech stocks - here\n\n4/EARNINGS IN EUROPE\n\nEurope\u2019s Q3 season too opens in earnest next week and is likely to again elicit unfavourable comparisons with corporate America. Since 2013, Wall Street has outperformed Europe\u2019s STOXX 600 index, benefiting from stronger economic growth and the Trump administration turbocharging companies with massive tax cuts.\n\nEurope Inc on the other hand seems to be stuck in corporate recession. Earnings across the STOXX 600 will likely fall for the third quarter straight, down by 3.7 percent year-on-year, according to Refinitiv data. But as U.S. tax cut effects fade, now might be a good time for Europe to catch up. Indeed, European earnings growth is seen overtaking the United States in 2020. But with powerhouse economy Germany teetering on the brink of recession and the manufacturing sector sunk in gloom, Europe\u2019s come-back seems as elusive as ever.\n\nThere are some though, who believe a comeback is nigh if the Brexit issue is resolved, Germany agrees to some fiscal stimulus and economic gloom lifts a bit. Any sign of a rebound in next week\u2019s corporate earnings flurry might lead portfolio managers to rethink exposure to the old continent.\n\n- More pain for Europe Inc as earnings drought seen spilling over into 2020\n\n- Europe Inc's recession expected to deepen as Q3 earnings outlook dims\n\nGRAPHIC: U.S. vs European earnings - here\n\n5/SUBMERGING MARKETS\n\nEmerging market hotspots Turkey and Argentina are back in the limelight - and not necessarily for the right reasons.\n\nTurkey\u2019s central bank will announce its latest interest rate decision on Thursday. No doubt, with interest rates at 16.5% the general direction is down, thanks to easing inflation pressures and a leader who is a self-declared enemy of interest rates.\n\nBut the meeting comes at a time when the lira is facing fresh challenges from the country\u2019s geopolitical roller coaster, moving currently at breakneck speed after Ankara\u2019s much condemned military push into Syria on Oct. 9, which whacked its bonds and weighed on its currency.\n\nMeanwhile Argentina\u2019s government is getting ready to face the music as voters are heading to the poll on Sunday Oct 27. Incumbent Mauricio Macri - who suffered a surprise defeat in August primary elections - is trailing well behind Peronist Alberto Fernandez.\n\nThe August shocker has rattled Argentina\u2019s debt and currency markets, driving the peso and bonds to record lows while investors fret about a shift back away from business-friendly Macri to populist-style policies.\n\nAnother debt restructuring is looming for the serial defaulter, and questions abound over the future of Buenos Aires\u2019 programme with the International Monetary Fund. It\u2019s time to get ready and see who may answer them.\n\n- Turkey's forex reserves an Achilles heel if sanctions were to deepen\n\n- IMF will stand by Argentina during crisis - Georgieva\n\nGRAPHIC: Argentina's debt to the IMF dwarfs other countries - here", "description": "", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442323345&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H1H1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
