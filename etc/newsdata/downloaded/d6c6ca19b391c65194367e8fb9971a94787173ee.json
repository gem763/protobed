So he called me a boring singer. John Legend and his filthy-mouthed wife didn\u2019t praise him,\u201d Legend said. \u201cHe just wanted to mention her because I think she\u2019s been a foil to him in the past. He\u2019s blocked her in the past, and I think he\u2019s always threatened by women that have their own voice and aren\u2019t submissive to him.\u201d\n\nA social media war exploded following Legend and Teigen\u2019s participation in a criminal justice reform town hall on NBC this month.\n\n\u201cGuys like boring musician John Legend and his filthy-mouthed wife, are talking now about how great it is \u2014 but I didn\u2019t see them around when we needed help getting it passed,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nWhen all of the people pushing so hard for Criminal Justice Reform were unable to come even close to getting it done, they came to me as a group and asked for my help. I got it done with a group of Senators & others who would never have gone for it. Obama couldn\u2019t come close\u2026. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 9, 2019\n\n\u2026.musician @johnlegend, and his filthy mouthed wife, are talking now about how great it is \u2013 but I didn\u2019t see them around when we needed help getting it passed. \u201cAnchor\u201d@LesterHoltNBC doesn\u2019t even bring up the subject of President Trump or the Republicans when talking about\u2026. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 9, 2019\n\nTrump did not tag Teigen, driving the tweet in which she described the president as a \u201cpussy ass bitch.\u201d\n\nlol what a pussy ass bitch. tagged everyone but me. an honor, mister president. \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 9, 2019\n\nthe absolute best part of his tweet is I literally didn't speak in the special, nor was I mentioned. I'm cackling at the pointless addition of me because he cannot not be a bitch pic.twitter.com/9ZkV7bh4FA \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 9, 2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s because she basically called him out for \u2013 because he atted (ph) me. You know, people that do Twitter a lot, you understand what atting means, which basically you mention their Twitter handle so that they see it in their mentions. He atted me. He atted Van Jones. He atted, you know, several other people. And the only person he did not actually at in that was filthy-mouthed wife,\u201d Legend told NPR.\n\n\u201cShe was basically like, why didn\u2019t you at me?\u2026 That\u2019s how that got trending,\u201d the Grammy-winner added.\n\nLegend told NPR that there are days he refuses to look at his mentions on Twitter, particularly when there is a story drawing the attention of so-called \u201cthe MAGAS.\u201d\n\n\u201cI often will go through days where I don\u2019t look at my mentions, particularly when I know there\u2019s some story that brought me to the attention of the MAGAs out there,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they kind of mobilize around hating you, your Twitter mentions are just an utter mess. And so there\u2019s some days where I just won\u2019t look at it, and it\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\nThis is hardly the first time the Oscar-winning singer has lashed out at the president.\n\nLegend described Trump as a \u201cflaming racist,\u201d \u201cpiece of shit,\u201d and \u201cevil fucking canker sore on America\u2019s whole landscape\u201d during a brief interview with TMZ over the summer.", "description": "John Legend said\u00a0during an interview with NPR on Tuesday that President Trump is \"threatened\" by women who are not \"submissive to him.\"", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/04/JohnLegendTrumpCorrupt.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
