The classy 22-year-old was the focal point and genesis of most attacking moves from the heart of midfield last year.\n\nHis departure for \u00a364million left a gaping hole slap bang in the middle of the pitch and the engine room had a major revamp in the summer with two 21-year-olds recruited to offer some solidity.\n\nEdson Alvarez joined for \u00a314m from Club America in Mexico and Lisandro Martinez arrived from Defensa y Justica in Argentina for \u00a33m.\n\nPerhaps what attracted Ajax to these two young guns was their versatility. Both arrived as centre backs but have played almost exclusively in central midfield so far.\n\nEdson Alvarez (right) has brought some bite to midfield as a converted centre back\n\nThe Dutch side demand technically capable players who have the ability to function in different areas of the pitch and Johan Cruyff would very much approve of the latest developments.\n\nMartinez and Alvarez have already earned the trust of Ten Hag and both started in the hugely impressive 3-0 win away against Valencia earlier this month. It would be no surprise at all to see them line up when Chelsea come to town.\n\nDonny van de Beek has been afforded some more creative freedom further forward, safe in the knowledge that his two new team-mates are defensively astute and covering in behind. The trio have a growing familiarity with each other and a nice balance is developing.\n\nLisandro Martinez is another key signing to have fitted in seamlessly this season\n\nAnd De Ligt?\n\nThis one is more of a work in progress. Daley Blind is tying up an end, to borrow a cricketing phrase, with the former Manchester United man moving back after beginning the season in midfield.\n\nAJAX'S TOP SCORERS THIS SEASON: Dusan Tadic - 8 Quincy Promes - 7 Klaas Jan Huntelaar - 7 Hakin Ziyech - 4 David Neres - 3 Donny van de Beek - 3\n\nHe has played every minute of the last seven matches at centre back and is usually paired with another of the more senior heads, Joel Veltman.\n\nBoth Martinez and Alvarez have the ability to slot in when needed but Ten Hag has opted for experienced in defence and young legs in midfield.\n\nVeltman has been indoctrinated in the Ajax philosophy since joining the club as a nine-year-old. He has more than 160 appearances to his name and, while clearly he lacks the raw ability of De Ligt, offers a calm and dependable presence.\n\nPerhaps it is the intangibles that this Ajax side will find themselves lacking when it comes to crunch time. De Ligt produced magnificent performances but was also mature beyond his years and a capable leader despite his tender age.\n\nThis season, it remains to be seen whether a dominant figurehead will emerge to take over that mantle.\n\nJoel Veltman's form this season has earned him further international honours with Holland\n\nWho are the new kids on the block?\n\nSERGINO DEST\n\nAt 18, the right back has looked sensational. He has a frightening burst of acceleration, rapid feet and is not afraid to go past his opposite man with a trick.\n\nAs Ajax dominate possession over most sides they come up against, his defensive play is yet to truly be placed under the microscope and Lampard might have a plan or two to test him out on Wednesday.\n\nBut the indications are that Dest has the ability to reach the very top. He was born in Holland to a Dutch mother and American serviceman father and the USA have already poached him for their national side.\n\nSergino Dest (right) has looked the part at right-back for Ajax despite his tender age\n\nPERR SCHUURS\n\nMany believe Schuurs to be De Ligt's heir apparent but he's being slowly bedded into the side.\n\nThe 19-year-old has started once this season and possesses many of the same traits that made his predecessor one of the most sought-after defenders in Europe.\n\nAt 6ft 3in, he's a commanding presence but also has a superb range of passing. If he can break into the side on a more regular basis then it will definitely be worth keeping an eye on his progress, every scout worth their salt will be.\n\nPerr Schuurs has a great range of passing and is a superb prospect in central defence\n\nDAVID NERES\n\nThe Brazilian winger is a joy to watch and has taken another step in his development this season.\n\nNeres' feet are under the table in Amsterdam having joined in 2017 and he's already started six games this term, scoring at an average of one in every two.\n\nLast season he contributed with 10 goals and Ten Hag clearly has a degree of trust in the former Sau Paulo man.\n\nThe array of skills in Neres' locker is breathtaking and he's beginning to find the right moments to be incisive rather than attempt something unnecessarily high risk.\n\nAt 22, he's more familiar to fans than Dest and Schuurs but can have a major say in Ajax's success this season.\n\nDavid Neres is a mainstay in the team now and has already scored three goals this season\n\nWhich star might be next out the door?\n\nKlass Jan Huntelaar is still deadly in front of goal at the age of 36 and former Southampton flop Dusan Tadic continues to shine but it is elsewhere that Europe's top clubs will be looking.\n\nQuincy Promes has scored seven goals already and looks on course for a brilliant campaign and he might turn a few heads, although perhaps the fact that he only joined in the summer makes a move less likely.\n\nHakin Ziyech and Van de Beek both seem primed for the exit door.\n\nZiyech is so technically gifted that you can imagine him fitting in seamlessly wherever the destination might be. At 27, he's entering his prime and perhaps Tottenham will consider a bid, particularly if Christian Eriksen, the last playmaker they signed from Ajax, leaves as expected.\n\nSpurs have also been heavily linked with Van de Beek, who impressed against them in both legs of the Champions League semi-final.\n\nAjax would command around \u00a380m for the midfielder and Manchester United are also thought to hold an interest.\n\nVan de Beek, 22, offers a more long-term investment than Ziyech and perhaps more functional, though just as effective as the Moroccan.\n\nDonny van de Beek has been linked with Tottenham and could leave in the summer\n\nHakin Ziyech (left) is a more technical player and is another who may be heading for the exit\n\nContinuity behind the scenes...\n\nAjax promote former players who have a deep connection with the club and understand the overarching philosophy.\n\nThere is consistent coaching throughout the age-group levels and a method of playing that means no one player will ever be greater than the system and team.\n\nPerhaps that is why Ajax manage to cope so well with losing players who should leave a massive void when they depart.\n\nMarc Overmars, who played at the club for five years, has been the director of football since 2012.\n\nEdwin van der Sar wants to have Ajax consistently competing among Europe's top sides\n\nEdwin van der Sar has more than 200 appearances in an Ajax shirt to his name and works as the CEO.\n\nBoth men love the club and are supremely motivated to help it succeed. Van der Sar has impressed to the extent that he's been linked with a similar role at Manchester United but recently said: 'I am really looking forward to bringing Ajax back to the European top level - that we probably touched last year - and to make sure we get the best opportunity to stay there.\u2019\n\nFrom the boardroom, to the pitch, to the youth set-up, everything in Amsterdam seems to be pointing in the same direction and this crop look capable of mixing it with Europe's elite again this year.", "description": "Ajax are no strangers to shedding their skin and arriving with a fresh new gleam after a summer of upheaval.\u00a0This campaign has been a real acid test of their regenerative powers.", "authors": ["Will Griffee For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/23/19905916-0-image-a-43_1571437701812.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
