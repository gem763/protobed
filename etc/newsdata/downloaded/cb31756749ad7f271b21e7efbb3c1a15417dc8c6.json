Since 1992, \u201cthe share of rural districts declined from 24 percent to 5 percent of all Democratic seats.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t just a House thing either. In the 2019-2020 Congress, Hopkins notes, \u201c79 percent of Democratic senators represented suburban states, while only 6 percent, or three senators, represented mostly rural states.\u201d\n\nBut, suburban success for Democrats has come almost exclusively in the areas in and around big cities, like Denver, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Detroit. There have been fewer inroads into suburbs surrounding smaller cities like Cincinnati, Ohio; Spokane, Washington; or Indianapolis, Indiana.", "description": "", "authors": ["Amy Walter", "Cookpolitical.Com Analysis National National-Politics Suburban-Vote-Isnt-Blue-It-Looks"], "top_image": ""}
