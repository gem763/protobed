He was just a very special person.\n\n\u201cI miss him every day and I think about him every day...he was a larger than life person and I say to myself what would he say and what would he think? But it doesn\u2019t compensate for the loss, he\u2019s simply not here any more,\u201d added the Austrian.\n\nLauda, a three times world champion, died in May aged 70 after a lung transplant last year.\n\nHamilton, third on Sunday, leads Bottas by 64 points with four races \u2014 worth a maximum 104 points \u2014 remaining and has his first chance of securing the drivers\u2019 title in Mexico in two weeks\u2019 time.\n\nWolff said doing the double again was an overwhelming feeling.\n\n\u201cWhen we embarked on the journey six or seven years ago, we wanted to win races more regularly and then fight for championships and then six years later it\u2019s the sixth championship in a row,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI feel so happy for everybody that was involved. Lots of hard work behind the scenes, lots of painful moments also, but the team was always able to pick themselves up.\n\n\u201cI think this team has become so strong because we have really been able to stand up when it didn\u2019t go well, like this morning (in qualifying). And that is something we need to continue to work on.\u201d\n\nFerrari have started the last five races on pole position, with Japanese Grand Prix qualifying completed only three hours before the race after being delayed to Sunday morning because of Typhoon Hagibis.\n\n\u201cQualifying came, and we weren\u2019t quick enough like the last few races and disappointed, and now we win a race and win both championships,\u201d said Wolff.\n\nThe team principal said Mercedes would not be easing up in the remaining races.\n\n\u201cThere is a saying that a good horse only jumps as high as it needs to jump. But that is not the case with us,\u201d he declared.\n\n\u201cThe regulations stay the same (in 2020) and therefore learning on this year\u2019s car is as important for next year as developing a new one...we are just not quick enough on a single lap against the Ferrari and we need to tackle that and we will.\u201d", "description": "Mercedes boss Toto Wolff dedicated the team's sixth successive Formula One constructors' world championship to late non-executive chairman Niki Lauda on a historic day in Japan on Sunday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191013&t=2&i=1440306999&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9C06X", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
