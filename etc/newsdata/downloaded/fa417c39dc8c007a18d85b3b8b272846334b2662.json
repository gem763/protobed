REUTERS/Ramzi Boudina\n\nThough some of his demands have been met, Mostefai plans to keep on marching each week along with tens of thousands of others who don\u2019t believe an election in December will change anything, as long as an opaque ruling elite remains in charge.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to protest because we don\u2019t trust the system. It might regenerate,\u201d said the 23-year-old apprentice hairdresser.\n\nSince the popular protests started, Algeria\u2019s veteran president Abdelaziz Bouteflika has quit after two decades in power, many of his coterie have been arrested for corruption and his once all-powerful security chief is behind bars.\n\nNow, the old guard, known by Algerians as \u201cLe Pouvoir\u201d, or \u201cThe Power\u201d, hope the Dec. 12 presidential election will end a state of constitutional limbo and create a government with enough legitimacy to wear down the demonstrators.\n\nBut with six weeks to go, the election is increasingly regarded by both sides as a pivotal test of strength after the most sustained public demand for peaceful change in decades.\n\nThe nebulous, leaderless opposition movement known as Hirak in Arabic has rejected the election, saying it won\u2019t be free or fair under the ruling hierarchy and that it hopes a small turnout will compel the authorities to accept bigger changes.\n\nThe government, meanwhile, has been increasing the pressure on the protesters since the summer by ramping up the police presence at marches, arresting dozens of demonstrators and also detaining prominent opposition figures.\n\nAn informal network of politicians, generals and security chiefs has dominated Algeria since independence and in 1992 they cancelled an election hardline Islamists were on course to win, leading to a protracted civil war in which 200,000 were killed.\n\n\u2018FINISH THE JOB\u2019\n\nFor some of the hundreds of thousands who marched at the peak of the protests in the spring, the departure of Bouteflika in April and the jailing of his senior allies was enough for them to stop.\n\n\u201cI think Hirak has achieved most of its goals, now we need to move forward,\u201d said Jalal Alalou, one Mostefai\u2019s friends.\n\nAbout 22 candidates have registered for the presidential poll and, for the first time, none is from Algeria\u2019s liberation movement, the FLN, that won independence from France in 1962 after a bloody eight-year guerrilla struggle.\n\nThe country\u2019s army, which has long been an influential political powerbroker, has also said it won\u2019t back any specific candidate to try to convince voters the election will be fair.\n\nBut that\u2019s not enough for others still committed to the protests.\n\n\u201cThose who are no longer marching with us are wrong because they think the departure of Bouteflika and his men is enough. They are wrong. We must finish the job,\u201d said Chawki, 23, a student at Blida University, 25 km (16 miles) south of the capital Algiers.\n\nAbdou, a 21-year-old student at Algiers\u2019 Bab Ezzouar University, agreed.\n\n\u201cBouteflika was a cancer. He has been removed. Now we need chemotherapy to kill the cells. This is why we must continue the protests,\u201d he said.\n\nBoth students, who declined to give their family names, said they want all senior figures associated with Bouteflika to leave office and for the army to step back from politics, before they will accept the December election.\n\n\u201cNo one can be against elections to end the crisis and move forward but we believe conditions for free and fair elections are not secured yet,\u201d said Chawki.\n\nECONOMIC FRUSTRATIONS\n\nFor Mostefai, the protests represent an opportunity for Algeria, the biggest country in Africa, to join the club of democracies, with civilian governments that operate within the rule of law.\n\nHe is from the Jolie Vue area near downtown Algiers, one of six children living in a modest apartment with their retired parents. Like most of the country\u2019s modern leaders, his father is a veteran of the fight for independence.\n\nThis Friday, the anniversary of the start of the uprising against French colonialism on Nov. 1, 1954, the opposition is seeking a particularly big protest in an effort to seize that mantle of freedom from the old guard.\n\nHis family\u2019s economic frustrations, such as his failure to find a job and his father\u2019s small pension of $290 a month, have added to Mostefai\u2019s determination to secure sweeping changes in a country that is a major oil and gas exporter and OPEC member.\n\nCorruption provoked much of the outrage behind this year\u2019s protests as many Algerians believed it was getting worse in recent years as the government carried out economic reforms to encourage the private sector.\n\nEconomists said the changes were necessary to reduce the state\u2019s reliance on oil, which accounts for 85% of Algeria\u2019s exports. But as members of the ruling elite, their relatives and friendly businessmen made fortunes, people grew angry.\n\nAlgeria came in at 105th out of 180 countries in Transparency International\u2019s corruption perceptions index last year with a score of 35 out of 100, below the average for the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nTo make matters worse, when global oil prices plunged in 2014, hitting Algeria\u2019s foreign currency reserves, the government responded by cutting back its lavish spending on social welfare programmes.\n\n\u201cOur rulers have stolen the country\u2019s resources. Algeria is rich but Algerians are poor,\u201d Mostefai said.\n\nStill, draped in the national flag as he marches each week, he acknowledges that broader change will be hard and that the protest movement lacks a clear strategy.\n\n\u201cWe understand that it has to stop one day, but not now. Bouteflika\u2019s men must go first ... We have launched the Hirak, but we don\u2019t know how to end it,\u201d he said.", "description": "Riad Mostefai has marched through the capital of Algeria every Friday since February to demand a purge of the ruling hierarchy, an end to corruption and the army's withdrawal from politics.", "authors": ["Lamine Chikhi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446568912&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T1CT-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
