Board has adjourned. \u2014 Fort Worth ISD (@FortWorthISD) September 17, 2019\n\nMs. Clark, an English teacher at Carter-Riverside High School, had written in some quickly deleted tweets addressed to Mr. Trump that her school had been \u201ctaken over\u201d by \u201cillegal students from Mexico.\u201d She added that Mr. Trump had won the election \u201con the promise that a wall would be built to protect our borders.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram about 88 percent of the students at Carter-Riverside are Hispanic.\n\nThe Fort Worth ISD board had voted unanimously to fire Ms. Clark in June, but tabled that decision last week after an independent examiner named by the Texas Education Agency recommended that she be reinstated, the local NBC affiliate reported.\n\nTuesday\u2019s vote effectively doubles down the original vote, though the tweet didn\u2019t say whether the vote was unanimous as some of the posts on the Fort Worth ISD\u2019s feed had specified about other items on Tuesday\u2019s agenda.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
