Club manager Frank Lampard has not selected him in four of the last five games.\n\nPulisic's only start in September came against Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup last week, however he again failed to impress, or find the score sheet, in a 7-1 win.\n\n\"This whole transfer, from the time it was announced, just seemed like a poor fit,\" Hislop, who made over 200 Premier League appearances during his career, said on ESPN.\n\n\"[Maurizio] Sarri didn't know he was coming in, and now, you know, there's a new manager coming in six months after that, and [Pulisic] doesn't fit into his plans.\n\n\"Now if Pulisic had sat tight at Dortmund for another six months, who knows where he would be? Perhaps playing right now. So there are other questions to ask, but as for now, it's about what he can do on the training ground to get himself back in.\"\n\nBurley seconded Hislop's statement, going on to say the 21-year-old must already be looking ahead to next season, even if it means moving away from Chelsea after just one year.\n\n\"Ultimately, we at the moment, have America's great young hope, not getting any game time for a guy that was playing on-loan in the Championship last season,\" said Burley, referring to Frank Lampard's decision to play Mason Mount ahead of Pulisic. \"That's the crux of this.\"\n\nHe added: \"Every player at the end of the season has to assess where they are. If they're playing regular, it's not a problem. But if you're not playing regular, you've got to assess how your next year is going to pan out.\"\n\nRead more: Christian Pulisic can be the Tiger Woods of American soccer, the Chelsea FC star's childhood club chairman says\n\nPulisic himself is frustrated\n\nPulisic himself recently admitted he has been frustrated by the difficult start to his Chelsea career, however also said he remains optimistic that things will change in the future if he puts in the work.\n\n\"It is very frustrating,\" the American told NBC Sports when asked about his lack of playing time. \"But I will continue to work my hardest because I want to play.\n\n\"I knew it was going to be tough coming here. It is never going to be easy. I've got to grind it out. I want to be back and be a part of the team and help the team win games.\n\n\"I want to play as many minutes as I can, that is really my goal, I want to be on the field. It is tough for me right now. I just have to continue to learn. Like I said, I want to be on the field really bad, I have to continue to work and prove myself to be there.\"\n\nChelsea next take on LOSC Lille in the Champions League on Wednesday, October 2.\n\nRead more:\n\n2 teenage soccer stars who once played together as children could soon become the sport's biggest rivals since Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo\n\nDani Alves says a 19-year-old Brazilian is the most talented young soccer player in the world, and his latest wonder goal for Real Madrid proves why\n\nCristiano Ronaldo once dreamed of being the world's best soccer player.
