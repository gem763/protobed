A doctor said the man, surnamed Wang, suffered an eye stroke caused by narrowing blood vessels in the retina. He said it could lead to permanent blindness if not treated quickly.\n\nThe doctor, Lei Tao, also said he sees about 20 patients a month with the same or similar symptoms.\n\n\u201cBlockage of the arteries in the retina is sudden, serious and the primary manifestation of eye disease that leads to blindness,\u201d he told the Post. \u201cThe occurrence rate is getting higher each year, and there is a trend of younger victims.\u201d\n\n\u201cUsing phones and electronic items is a big part of life for young people, which puts excessive strain on their vision,\u201d he added. \u201cThis can trigger eye stroke.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that extended screen use can lead to eye problems, however.

According to scientific journal AAAS, researchers created CRADLE, or Computer Assisted Detector of Leukoria, that uses machine learning to look for early signs of \"white eye\" reflections in photos, which could point to cataracts and other conditions.\n\nResearchers tested it with more than 50,000 photos of children and detected eye diseases in half. Of those, the app spotted 16 instances of disease 1.3 years before doctors made a diagnosis. CRADLE has not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "A man in northwest China lost his sight after playing mobile games.", "authors": ["Shawn M.
