I guess that means that they, along with all of those that evilly 'Colluded' with them, must all be immediately Impeached!'\n\nSeeking Pelosi and Schiff's impeachment may prove difficult, under the rules set forth under the constitution.\n\nThose who can be impeached include 'The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States,' according to Article ii, section 4 of the constitution.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi was joined by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff at a news conference Wednesday as House Democrats moved ahead in the impeachment inquiry of President Trump\n\nThe one problem with Trump's call for impeachment, is that members of Congress are not civil officers, for the very purpose of impeachment.\n\nInstead, senators and representatives are subject to expulsion, under the constitution.\n\nTrump's tweet Sunday just before 10:30 pm added Pelosi to his list of Democrats who he claims may be guilty of betraying the country.\n\nSchiff (above), Pelosi and other Democrats are looking to impeach the president after they say he made a July 25 call to pressure Ukraine President Volodymyr into investigating former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter for corruption\n\nTrump may not see Schiff and Pelosi demands, since members of Congress are not civil officers, for the very purpose of impeachment. Instead, senators and representatives are subject to expulsion.\n\nTrump also alleged in his tweet that Pelosi knew of 'the illegal meetings with a highly partisan 'Whistleblower' & lawyer...'\n\nThe reference was about a CIA agent who accused Trump of setting a quid pro quo of millions in military aid for an investigation into Biden and his son Hunter Biden's business dealings in Ukraine, based on second-hand information.\n\nThe unidentified agent, who worked for a short time in the White house and filed an official whistleblower complaint, is represented by attorney Mark Zaid, who on Sunday said he had a new client -- a second whistle blower who also was an intelligence official -- who had first-hand knowledge that supported some of the agent's allegations against the president.\n\nTrump's claim the agent was 'highly partisan,' came after the New York Times reported last week that the whistleblower had given Schiff's committee an 'early warning' about filing the complaint.\n\nSchiff has taken heat from critics who claim he withheld the report to later exploit the news of the complaint.", "description": "President Donald Trump accused Nancy Pelosi of treason over 'Shifty", "authors": ["Ralph R.
