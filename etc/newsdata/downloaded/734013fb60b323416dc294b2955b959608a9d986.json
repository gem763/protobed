One teacher blamed \u2018Mexican\u2019 culture.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nDulce Maria Alavez, 5, vanished from a New Jersey park in broad daylight on Sept. 16 and has been missing since.\n\nNo one knows for sure what happened to 5-year-old Dulce Maria Alavez, who disappeared from a playground in Bridgeton, N.J., in broad daylight last week and has been missing ever since.\n\nBut one South Jersey elementary school teacher recently took to Facebook to suggest that cultural differences \u2014 in particular, the girl\u2019s Mexican heritage \u2014 could explain why the girl wasn\u2019t being watched more closely.\n\nAccording to the Daily Journal and NJ.com, Jennifer Hewitt Bishop\u2019s comment was written in response to a Facebook post questioning why Alavez\u2019s mother was sitting in her car about 30 yards away while her children played on the swings on Sept. 16, when the girl vanished in what police believe was an abduction.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re Mexican, it\u2019s their culture,\u201d Bishop replied. \u201cThey don\u2019t supervise their children like we do.\u201d\n\nBishop, who works as a special education in-class resource teacher in the nearby Vineland Public Schools, is now facing disciplinary action for her remarks. In a statement to local media outlets, officials called her comment about Mexican culture \u201coffensive, inflammatory, and entirely unacceptable.\u201d\n\nWhile police have been hunting down leads, searching woods and ponds, and reviewing hundreds of hours of surveillance footage, the missing girl\u2019s mother, Noema Alavez Perez, has faced intense scrutiny for seemingly innocuous decisions, with critics latching on the fact that she once smoked marijuana, and, after her daughter disappeared, accepted and ate a slice of pizza. Meanwhile, the ongoing investigation may have been hindered by the fact that some potential witnesses are undocumented and fear coming into contact with the police, authorities say.\n\nJoe Rossi, the district\u2019s executive director of personnel, told NJ.com that officials became aware of Bishop\u2019s comments on Friday after several people messaged the Facebook page for Vineland Public Schools to report what she had said. Administrators launched an investigation and Bishop was yanked from her classroom, though Rossi wouldn\u2019t specify whether she had been suspended or was placed on leave. He told the outlet that the school board would determine the second-year teacher\u2019s future at a Wednesday night personnel meeting that was closed to the public.\n\nBishop could not be reached for comment late Wednesday.\n\nSome have suggested that Bishop\u2019s comments about Mexican culture weren\u2019t intended to be malicious. Jeff Deminski, the host of a conservative political talk show on New Jersey 101.5, argued that the teacher had been trying to say, \u201cDon\u2019t judge this mother, she\u2019s from a different culture, one that in my anecdotal experience doesn\u2019t seem to bubble wrap and helicopter parent their children at every turn the way white people do,\u201d but had expressed herself \u201cin a manner that wasn\u2019t artful.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Lou Russo, the president of the Vineland Education Association, told the Daily Journal that while he couldn\u2019t comment on a personnel matter, he believes that social media is a \u201cdangerous place\u201d where comments are \u201coften misunderstood and taken out of context by a virtual crowd that rarely takes time to think and reflect or seek clarification before they react with verbal attacks of their own.\u201d\n\nThe search for the missing 5-year-old, which is entering its 11th day, began after Dulce\u2019s mother called police to say that her daughter had disappeared. Alavez Perez, who is 19, grew up in Bridgeton. She was 14 when her daughter was born, and she told the Philadelphia Inquirer that her parents, who emigrated to New Jersey from Mexico 20 years ago, took custody of Dulce and helped raise her. The girl\u2019s father has since returned to Mexico, she said.\n\nAccording to NJ.com, Alavez Perez told authorities that she had driven her kids and another young relative to the playground at Bridgeton City Park a little after 4 p.m. on Sept. 16, after they stopped to get ice cream. When Dulce and her 3-year-old brother went off to play, Alavez Perez stayed behind in the car with the other child.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, the boy ran back to the car alone and in tears. Alavez Perez told authorities that he pointed toward some storage buildings near the park. At first, she assumed that her daughter was playing hide-and-seek.\n\n\u201cWe thought that she was just hiding, playing around and we went looking for her but we couldn\u2019t find her,\u201d she told CBS Philadelphia.\n\nVIDEO: This is video\u2014the last known images\u2014of Dulce Alavez, just being a kid, getting ice cream with her mom & brother.

The two combed the park before notifying police shortly before 5 p.m., NJ.com reported. The next day, police issued an Amber Alert after learning that a man had been seen leading the 5-year-old away from the park and into a red van with tinted windows at approximately 4:20 p.m., then driving away.\n\nAuthorities told WPVI on Tuesday that they are continuing to search for the suspect, described as a light-skinned and possibly Hispanic man with acne and a slender build, and are operating under the assumption that the 5-year-old is alive. The reward for Dulce\u2019s return has now reached $35,000, and the FBI has added her to the agency\u2019s \u201cMost Wanted\u201d list for kidnapping victims.\n\nBridgeton, a small city whose economy revolves around agriculture and frozen food processing, has a predominantly Latino population and is home to a significant number of Mexican and Guatemalan immigrants. Both the city\u2019s police chief, Michael Gaimari, and New Jersey\u2019s attorney general, Gurbir Grewal, have raised concerns that some residents who might have valuable information to share have refrained from coming forward because of their immigration status. Those fears may have been compounded by the fact that Immigration and Customs Enforcement detained Alavez Perez\u2019s boyfriend, a Mexican citizen, several days after Dulce disappeared.\n\nThe 27-year-old was later released. An ICE spokesman told NBC Philadelphia that the man was \u201cpart of an ongoing investigation by local, state and federal law enforcement partners,\u201d but wouldn\u2019t comment on whether there was any connection to Dulce\u2019s disappearance.\n\nMeanwhile, Alavez Perez has faced immense public scrutiny. She told the Philadelphia Inquirer that after not eating for 36 hours following her daughter\u2019s disappearance, she accepted a slice of pizza that someone handed to her, only to be accosted by a stranger who had joined the search effort as a volunteer.\n\n\u201c\u2018If my daughter was missing, I wouldn\u2019t eat!\u2019 this lady yelled at me,\u201d Alavez Perez said. \u201cThen she started taking a video of me.\"\n\nAfter that, Alavez Perez stopped going back to the park. She told NJ.com that she had also taken down her Facebook page after critics began closely scrutinizing her past posts, including an old photo that showed her smoking marijuana. Other online comments targeted her family members, and even accused her mother of prostituting her, she said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re saying I didn\u2019t love my kids and I just gave my kids away to someone,\u201d Alavez Perez told the outlet.", "description": "\u201cThey\u2019re Mexican, it\u2019s their culture,\" Jennifer Hewitt Bishop wrote on Facebook. \"They don\u2019t supervise their children like we do.\u201d", "authors": ["Antonia Noori Farzan", "Reporter For The Morning Mix", "September At Am", "Antonia Noori Farzan Is A Reporter On The Washington Post'S Morning Mix Team.
