The Robberg Nature Reserve falls under station 14\u2019s response area, and with its towering cliffs and rocky coastline, the risks to hikers who frequent its trails are very real.\n\n\n\nParts of the Robberg reserve include very narrow trail passages and if a hiker is injured, it is often preferable to evacuate them by sea, as opposed to carrying a stretcher along the trail.\n\nThe NSRI station 14 team wanted a stretcher that would not capsize once it became waterborne, especially in the high-surf often present around Robberg. This was achieved by adding stability with floating pontoons, which are solid to prevent them from puncturing if the stretcher should fall on, or smash against, rocks.\n\nFurther design elements which make this South African floating stretcher design so clever are its fibreglass hull, which is surfaced with nylon skids. These protect the stretcher\u2019s structure when sliding it over rocks as patients are transferred from the shore to surf zone.\n\nAn integrated splash hood keeps water and direct sunlight off an evacuee.\n\nThe station 14 design was turned to reality by Marcus van Deventer.\n\nThis is the design that won Rodgers and Gibson second place in the 2019 IMRF awards in London, in action.\n\n\n\n\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "Two volunteer rescuers have won an international award for their rescue stretcher, designed to deal with a stretch of Plettenberg Bay coast.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9353/089a1080bbf94bb8b17ddca661b37047.png", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
