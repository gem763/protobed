However, through a successful privilege escalation, the actor managed to obtain domain admin privileges,\" said Jaya Baloo, Avast Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).\n\nBaloo said Avast intentionally left the compromised VPN profile active, with the purpose of tracking the attacker and observing their actions.\n\nThis lasted until October 15, when the company finished auditing previous CCleaner releases, and pushed out a new clean update.\n\nAt the same time, Avast also changed the digital certificate it was using to sign CCleaner updates. The new update was signed with a new digital certificate, and the company revoked the previous certificate used to sign older CCleaner releases. It did so to prevent attackers from using to sign fake CCleaner updates, in case the hackers managed to get their hands on the old certificate during the recent intrusion.\n\n\"Having taken all these precautions, we are confident to say that our CCleaner users are protected and unaffected,\" Baloo said.\n\nThe antivirus maker said it's currently investigating the incident together with the Czech intelligence agency, Security Information Service (BIS), the local Czech police force cybersecurity division, and an external forensics team.\n\nAvast said there is no evidence at this time to suggest this attack was caused by the same group who breached its infrastructure in 2017; however, the company pointed out that the intrusion was carried out by an experienced threat actor.\n\n\"From the insights we have gathered so far, it is clear that this was an extremely sophisticated attempt against us that had the intention to leave no traces of the intruder or their purpose, and that the actor was progressing with exceptional caution in order to not be detected,\" Baloo said.\n\nAvast previously received praises for the openness it showed while investigating the 2017 CCleaner hack. The investigation is ongoing and the company promised more updates.", "description": "Czech antivirus maker discloses second attack aimed at compromising CCleaner releases.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/21/da656594-8f76-459c-9534-19d93090a52e/thumbnail/770x578/55d8740153c8e89960dbb01d5f68f229/avast.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
