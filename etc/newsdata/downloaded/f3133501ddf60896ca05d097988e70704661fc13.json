Profits under generally accepted accounting principles were $1.61 a share, ahead of the $1.40 management had told investors to expect.\n\nThe company said revenue from its digital-media segment was $1.96 billion, up 22% year over year. The digital-experience segment yielded revenue of $821 million, up 34%.\n\nGuidance for the fourth quarter was less upbeat than expected. Adobe is projecting November-quarter revenue of $2.97 billion with profits of $2.25 on a non-GAAP basis, or $1.68 under GAAP. The Street consensus has been for $3.03 billion and $2.30 a share in non-GAAP profits.\n\nThe company sees growth slipping to 20% in the digital-media segment and 23% in digital experience.\n\n\u201cCustomers across every industry continue to rely on Adobe to run their businesses, transform how they work, and bring their creative ideas to life as reflected in our record Q3 results,\u201d Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re excited for the opportunities in front of us and confident in our ability to drive strong top-line and bottom-line growth.\u201d\n\nIn prepared remarks for Tuesday afternoon\u2019s earnings call, Chief Financial Officer John Murphy said that while revenue was strong overall, subscription bookings for the company\u2019s Marketo business for the midmarket \u201cdid not meet our expectations,\u201d and that the company is increasing focus on demand generation and inside sales.\n\nHe also said that there were subscription-booking delays for Analytics Cloud, \u201cwith related shortfalls in consulting services bookings and revenue associated with the launch of our new Adobe Experience Platform.\u201d\n\nMurphy noted that revenue in the August quarter was reduced by about $8.5 million by foreign-exchange factors.\n\nIn an interview with Barron\u2019s, Murphy said that the issues are all \u201ccompletely fixable\u201d and Adobe-specific. He added that the company is not seeing any impact from macro slowness on its business.\n\nAdobe repurchased 2.6 million shares in the quarter at a cost of about $750 million. There is $5.85 billion remaining on an $8 billion repurchase program authorized in May 2018.\n\nAdobe closed up 0.62%, at $284.69, on Tuesday.\n\nWrite to Eric J.
