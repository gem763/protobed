As part of the ban, all tobacco sellers were required to post notices about the danger of vaping unregulated THC, the ingredient in marijuana that's been linked to most lung-damage cases.\n\nSeveral Utah vape shops responded by suing the state's Department of Health, claiming there is no evidence to suggest flavored e-cigarettes are causing lung damage and that the ban would cause \"irreparable harm to their business reputation\" to the point that they would be \"forced to close their businesses.\"\n\nHEALTH OFFICIAL: NO 'SHORT LIST' OF VAPING ILLNESS SUSPECTS\n\nRecent cases of lung damage, they argued, are instead caused by \"these persons' use of black-market THC cartridges,\" according to the lawsuit.\n\nJUUL SUSPENDS POPULAR VAPING FLAVORS\n\nDespite the ruling Monday, the state health department said they will continue with other efforts to \"stop this outbreak and to protect the public's health.\"\n\nThe department tweeted in part, \"Our top priority is stopping the outbreak of vaping-associated lung injuries. We believe the emergency rule is one of the tools that can help us achieve that goal.\"\n\nVAPING DEVICES NOW ACCEPTED ON DRUG TAKE BACK DAY\n\nNearly 1,500 people across the country have become sick from vaping, and 33 people have died, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported.\n\nPresident Trump's administration has proposed a sweeping ban on e-cigarette flavors in response to the deaths. Several states have already done so.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nHealth officials throughout the country are advising people not to use any vaping product until the cause of the illnesses is better understood.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Local vape shops in Utah will temporarily be allowed to sell flavored e-cigarette juices, a judge ruled Monday.", "authors": ["Daniella Genovese"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Vaping-AP.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
