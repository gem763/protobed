The secretive Catholic military order of the Knights Templar was founded in 1119 and was active until 1312 when it was disbanded by Pope Clement V. They wore distinctive white mantles with a red cross and were a skilled fighting force during the Crusades. Initiation ceremonies took place in secret locations, inside domed churches resembling the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. The Caynton caves, with their Romanesque archways, circular naves, pillars and crannies for candles, certainly fit the bill.\n\nDr Lin said: 'I'm in Israel in search of the Knights Templar. These warrior monks are the stuff of legend, and so is their gold.\n\n'During the Crusades the Knights Templar battle for God, gold and glory. Somewhere in the modern city of Acre lies their command centre, and possibly their treasure.\n\n'It's the stuff of childhood dreams. I'm here to find them.'\n\nThe Knights Templar was a chivalrous religious order, a group of warrior monks, formed to protect Christian pilgrims in the Holy Land from marauding Saracens.\n\nThey became established in England in the 12th century, to raise money for the Crusades, and officially disbanded a couple of hundred years later.\n\nUsing LiDAR technology Dr Lin and the National Geographic team scanned an area in the port of Acre, where they found a fortress of The Knights Templar used in the Third Crusade - where a car park now stands.\n\nLost Knights Templar HQ and secret treasure tunnels under Israel revealed by laser scans after 800 years\n\nThe solid stone fortress was built on a shallow patch of coast which is now a lagoon\n\nLiDAR scans can be taken by a drone or helicopter and work by calculating distances to the ground to build a 3D model.\n\nThe National Geographic's series Lost Cities with Albert Lin airs Mondays\n\nThis often reveals structures which have become hidden by the modern metropolis or jungle.\n\nScans carried out by the National Geographic archaeologists found both a guard house and a series of tunnels.\n\nUsing a virtual reality app the team displayed how the scenery would have looked 800 years ago with the vast fortress reconstructed with an outline towering above them on the coast.\n\nDr Lin can be heard exclaiming: 'It's the stuff of fairy tales, and it's all right here like a ghost.'\n\nCreating a mighty sea defence the fortress would have presented a menacing obstacle to anyone approaching to invade it sat on the shoreline with lookout towers - in what is now a shallow lagoon.\n\nThe snaking tunnels will help historians piece together the movements of the Knights Templar\n\nThe discovery of the tunnels will help historians piece together the movements of the Knights Templar as it suggests they transported gold from the port to the 'treasure tower' via the tunnels.\n\nMuch mystery surrounds the Knights Templar's demise and what became of their treasure when the group disbanded.\n\nDr Lin believes the fortress or 'treasure tower' could have been the last location of the Templar's gold.\n\nHe said: 'The Templar's hidden tunnels snaked beneath the streets,' Dr Lin said.\n\n'They secretly transported gold to the Acre fortress' crowning glory, its treasure tower.'\n\nDr Lin believes the fortress or 'treasure tower' could have been the last location of the Templar's gold.
