Devonte Graham had 14 points and 12 assists, while Cody Zeller added 14 points and 13 rebounds for Charlotte, which has lost three straight after a season-opening win over Chicago.\n\nThe Clippers pulled away with a 16-5 run spanning the final two quarters, stretching their lead to 96-79 with 7 \u00bd minutes to play. Charlotte made an 11-2 surge, cutting the lead to single digits on Miles Bridges' 3-pointer with 4:16 left, but Harrell and Williams made big shots down the stretch.\n\nThe Clippers have won 10 straight over the Hornets at Staples Center since February 2009. Los Angeles has won 10 of its last 11 overall against Charlotte.\n\nCharlotte appeared to have more favorable defensive matchups against these Staples Center co-tenants than they did one night earlier, when LeBron James and Anthony Davis led the Lakers to a comfortable win in the second half.\n\nBut not many teams have an answer for Leonard, who has added improved playmaking skills to his already formidable offensive arsenal.\n\nTwo days after setting a career high with 10 assists in Phoenix \u2014 which surpassed his previous career high of nine, set two days before that against Golden State \u2014 he had five in the first half against Charlotte, including a sublime bounce pass through traffic to Ivica Zubac shortly before halftime.\n\nBut LA's defensive flaws exposed in Phoenix were obvious again, with the Hornets getting balanced scoring and plenty of open opportunities. The Clippers will need more time to jell as a defensive unit, but coach Doc Rivers simply hopes for increased effort on that end over the next few games.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nHornets: Zeller sported a bandage on the cut above his left eye from his mutual elbowing with Davis in their loss to the Lakers on Sunday night. ... Malik Monk scored 15 points.\n\nClippers: Shamet surpassed his season high with four 3-pointers in the first six minutes of the game. ... Paul George is still out while he recovers from a shoulder injury, but coach Doc Rivers said he consults frequently with his newest star about potential offensive sets that will benefit him when he is ready to play.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nHornets: Visit the Sacramento Kings on Wednesday night.\n\nClippers: Visit the Utah Jazz on Wednesday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
