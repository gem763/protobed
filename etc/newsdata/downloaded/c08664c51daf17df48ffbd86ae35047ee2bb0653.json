We were like \"come on boys, come through\",' Judy said.\n\nJudy said in hindsight she could have blocked them on the stairs in a somewhat uncharacteristic move for the pair.\n\n'I hope everybody notices that we just got beaten by 10 seconds by two huge, muscly overbuilt gorgeous guys, who were much younger than us,' Therese added.\n\n'We were just so polite': The duo said they regret not fighting a little bit harder and had no idea they were just 10 seconds away from the finish\n\nThe duo were loved by Australians for their refreshingly cheerful and clean-cut character, which sometimes proved to be their downfall.\n\nOne controversial moment was during a dumpling making challenge in Korea where Bondi influencers Sid and Ash stole from the unsuspecting nuns.\n\nDespite the underhanded behaviour Therese said the situation was hilarious.\n\nNot quite number one: Judy said in hindsight she could have blocked the two men on the stairs to have a better chance at securing the $250,000 in prize money\n\n'A lot of our friends and people around Australia are outraged that (Sid and Ash) stole our dumpling, but it was just a really funny thing. It\u2019s just part of the fun of the game,' Therese said.\n\nJudy and Therese where seen on a video posted to Instagram watching the cheating unfold but still captioned the clip #weforgiveyou.\n\nThe nuns said they always had God on their side during the race and Judy noted that she prayed the two would not fight.\n\nThe Amazing Race Australia will continue next Monday at 7.30 on Channel 10", "description": "Fan favourites Judy and Therese were eliminated from the race on Tuesday after they were overtaken by nurses Femi and Nick, leaving them in last place.", "authors": ["Tom Place For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/14/20329934-0-image-a-16_1572359714780.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
