Week 7 offers up juicy matchups and we are here to help you make money off of them. USA TODAY\n\nThe NFL's two conference races are shaping up to be as divergent as many foresaw they would be.\n\nThe AFC once again has a clear front-runner for the top overall seed in the New England Patriots, who are off to their fourth 6-0 start since 2004. But in the NFC, the picture is slightly murkier.\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers boast the distinction of being the conference's only undefeated team at 5-0. But with four of their wins coming against teams with losing records, there's still lingering skepticism even as Richard Sherman declares there's no more room on the bandwagon. The New Orleans Saints, Green Bay Packers and Seattle Seahawks are not far off at 5-1, and each has built an impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in the first six weeks.\n\nWith that in mind, we asked reporters and editors from USA TODAY and the USA TODAY Network: Who's the best team in the NFC right now?\n\nTheir answers:\n\nThe New Orleans Saints \u2013 with or without the Papal blessing.\n\nI think I was like most people and wrote the Saints off after Drew Brees got hurt. That\u2019s not a reflection on Teddy Bridgewater or his abilities, but Brees is a first-ballot future Hall of Famer and, if nothing else, the psychological blow of losing him for a good chunk of the season would be significant. Couple that with the fact Bridgewater had made only one start since 2015, largely due to injuries, and, well, you can see why I saw the Saints headed for a 4-12 finish.\n\nBut Bridgewater has been solid, keeping the offense moving and limiting mistakes. That\u2019s as good as you can ask for from your backup quarterback. Alvin Kamara continues to be a special player, and Michael Thomas has made Bridgewater\u2019s life easier. When Bridgewater has gotten in trouble, the defense has stepped up to bail him out.\n\nBest of all, New Orleans has gotten through the worst of its schedule. They\u2019ve already played the Houston Texans, Rams, Seattle Seahawks and Dallas Cowboys, and are 5-1. With three games left against the Atlanta Falcons and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, plus one against the Tennessee Titans, the Saints can afford to not rush Brees\u2019 return and still have the inside track to the NFC South title.\n\nGET IN THE GAME!: Our newsletter brings exclusive NFL analysis.

That's no knock on the iconic quarterback, expected to return from a fractured thumb at some point this season. Yet while Brees mends, his team has demonstrated that it is more complete than you ever imagined -- winning with defense, special teams and with Teddy Bridgewater. It hasn't been pretty, but that's the actual beauty of this run that Sean Payton has his team on with one of the best coaching jobs of his career. If you thought the Saints were just a dome team that can sling it around on the turf, they've proven they possess a certain grit. And that includes the stars, like Michael Thomas and Alvin Kamara. Another gut check looms this weekend at Chicago.\n\nWe figured the Saints would come back strong after that heartbreak of a blown non-call in the NFC title game, but they've had to show another level to their resilience since Brees went down in Week 2. Maybe the most impressive win was the first one with Bridgewater starting, at Seattle. It gave them something to build on. Done. And it's the only blemish on Seattle's record (5-1). Why New Orleans (5-1) and not the undefeated 49ers (5-0)? I'll go with degree of difficulty. When the 49ers lost Jimmy Garoppolo last year, there pretty much went the season. Of course, with Jimmy G. back and the defense humming with all of the young talent up from, San Francisco's best start since 1990 counts for a whole lot. What a healthy debate, which is not complete without Aaron Rodgers and Green Bay (5-1). One thing for sure: The defending NFC champion Rams (3-3) are so last year ... and the only team to beat the Saints this year.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m overthinking this again by pondering the full weight of the question: Who's the best team in the NFC right now?\n\nRight \u2026 NOW?\n\nI\u2019m inclined to take the Minnesota Vikings, partially because I like to go outside the box \u2026 but also because it could very well be true. Kirk Cousins \u2013 I know, I know \u2013 seems to be back in a groove, which means his frumpy wide receivers are, too. You could argue Dalvin Cook has been the best back in the league this year not named McCaffrey. And Mike Zimmer\u2019s defense is almost always formidable, the 49ers the only unit in the NFC ranked higher.\n\nSo, at the moment \u2013 if the playoffs started today (they don\u2019t) \u2013 I might lean Vikes. But understand, this is also a vote against the state of the other teams in the conference \u2013 RIGHT NOW. Alvin Kamara is banged up, and Drew Brees is still on the shelf in New Orleans. The Niners have been fabulous but are missing the league\u2019s best fullback and both of their starting tackles. The Packers are good, but I can\u2019t help but feel this offense still isn\u2019t fine-tuned \u2026 and that they might not have deserved Monday night\u2019s win. And Russell Wilson would currently get my MVP vote, but I can\u2019t help but feel the Seahawks are using bit too much smoke and mirrors at present.\n\nAnyhoo \u2026 ask me again next week \u2013 right THEN \u2013 I might give you a different answer.\n\nMagician Aaron Rodgers and the Packers get my vote for best team in the NFC right now. Rogers has continued to create plays when they seem unlikely. He and Matt LaFleur have game-planned wins in the two contests since losing star receiver Davante Adams to turf toe. Running back Aaron Jones, who torched the Cowboys for four touchdowns, has improved his yards-per-carry average in Adams\u2019 absence. And Green Bay\u2019s tandem pass-rush duo of Preston Smith and Za\u2019Darius Smith have tormented opponents for 13 sacks. The Packers have shown signs of vulnerability: They let Detroit jump out to a 13-0 league this week, and the Cowboys to score 21 points to Green Bay\u2019s three in the second half of a Week 5 win. But in the end, Green Bay seems to do enough at the right moments to capitalize. That should only be easier when Adams returns.\n\nIt has to be the San Francisco 49ers. I think the Packers and the Seahawks are close. But I\u2019ve gotta go Niners. I know that they are still finding their way on offense as Jimmy Garoppolo continues to regain comfort after a year of because of knee surgery. But their defense is downright nasty. They\u2019re loaded with talent at each level. They attack with aggression. They force turnovers. The Niners have turned the ball over 10 times in five games, but their defense is so good that they get the necessary stops to erase those offensive transgressions. This team has a clear identity. They want to attack on defense, they want to run the ball, and then create big-play opportunities downfield. It\u2019s only a matter of time before this offense starts running on all cylinders and matches the effectiveness of the defense and when that happens, the 49ers will have a legit chance to make a deep playoff run.\n\nMy answer now is the same as it was at the start of the year. I picked the Saints to be the eventual Super Bowl LIV champions, and I\u2019m feeling pretty good about that, still. The best sign, to me, of a great team, is one that continues to have success even when confronted by adversity or injury. Well, losing quarterback Drew Brees to a thumb injury on his throwing hand certainly qualifies, but New Orleans has won all four games backup Teddy Bridgewater has started. The Saints also need running back Alvin Kamara to get healthy. But this team is built to win in the postseason. They have a stout defense, explosive playmakers on offense with Brees, Kamara, and receiver Michael Thomas, and stellar special teams play.\n\nThe other thing they have is what the San Francisco 49ers don\u2019t, and that\u2019s experience. I love what the Niners are doing (and picked them to be a wild card team in the preseason). They, too, have one of the stingiest defenses in the NFL, and another brilliant offensive coach \u2013 like Sean Payton in New Orleans \u2013 in Kyle Shanahan. But these Saints are playoff fixtures and have been there before. In January and in February, that matters.\n\nIn the words of Bill Parcells (and every cliche-spouting coach since): You are what your record says you are. So, at least at this point in the season, I've got to go with the only undefeated team left in the conference: The San Francisco 49ers.\n\nWhile I'm not convinced they'll ultimately wind up representing the NFC in the Super Bowl, you have to give props where props are due. The 49ers have arguably the most dominant defense in the conference, holding opponents to fewer than two scores on average, and they've posted an absurd point differential (+83 through five games -- the best such mark since the merger). Can they keep it up? Probably not. But as of now, I think they deserve the title of best team in the NFC.\n\nSal Maiorana, Rochester Democrat & Chronicle\n\nThe obvious choice, because they are the lone undefeated team in the NFC, is also the right choice: The 49ers.\n\nKyle Shanahan has built a roster that is fast and athletic, particularly on the defensive side, and he just watched his defense completely throttle the normally high-scoring Rams in its biggest test of the season.\n\nThe 49ers also have quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo healthy and functioning at a high level, surrounded by some dangerous weapons such as running back Matt Breida and tight end George Kittle.\n\nSan Francisco is third in the league in scoring and second in the league in scoring defense which is really all you need to know.\n\nBob McManaman, Arizona Republic\n\nIt would be easy to pick the 49ers. They\u2019re undefeated, their defense and is for real and they don\u2019t look to be pretenders at all. You could make a significant case for the Packers just as well. The defense is improved and the offense hasn\u2019t even hit its stride yet even though they\u2019ve only lost one game. The team to fear the most, however, has to be the Saints. They haven\u2019t missed a beat with Teddy Bridgewater taking over for Drew Brees, they have two of the best playmakers in the game in Michael Thomas and Alvin Kamara and Brees is targeting a Week 8 return against the Cardinals. Don\u2019t be surprised to see them in the Super Bowl.\n\nArt Stapleton, NorthJersey.com\n\nThe Saints. To do what they have done without Drew Brees is very impressive. Cameron Jordan is also one of the most underappreciated stars in the league, and this defense changes games. If Brees and Alvin Kamara can get healthy, the Saints might just be the best team in the entire NFL.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' NFL coverage on Twitter @usatodaynfl.", "description": "Unlike the AFC, the NFC race appears to be wide open.
