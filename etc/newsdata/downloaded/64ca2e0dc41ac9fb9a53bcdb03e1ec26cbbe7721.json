This means that we have absolutely no trust in humanity or human society.\n\nA Sanyasi, on the other hand, has given up the idea of owning and hence he has to fully and completely trust the society for his existence.\n\nSo, before we were reformed and enlightened by the idea of virtue of selfishness that we imported from west and are now celebrating, we had an economic model for the society.\n\nThrough four phases of life, we were expected to enjoy all the pleasures of life but in the last phase, we were expected to let go of the wealth creation, of ownership, of hoarding, and move to becoming trustees and mentors of the generations coming in.\n\nIt was a simple idea that not only accepted realities of human life, or rather death, but also prevented the damage we can do to the planet by losing sight of the temporariness of our existence.\n\nThough it may look philosophical, it is nothing but a practical economics in action.\n\nAn economics that has to be in place on a finite planet inhabited by an animal with infinite imagination and hence potential to be infinitely greedy.\n\nWhile I am a bit over-critical about the Ivy League thinkers, deep within me I know that they are also thinking the same. It is obvious to anyone who is thinking today that we are heading for a meltdown and a new way of life has to be found.\n\nMy only lament is that we have cluttered Indian thinking a bit too much now and mindless critique of ancient Indian ideas is fashion of the season amongst even educated Indians.\n\nThis is disallowing us to use our inheritance that is mostly intellectual and our own intellectuals are not ready to give it even a cursory look out of fear of the peer pressure of the west-educated elites that have filled Indian intellectual space.\n\nMy only humble request is that we have a culture that lasted for almost five thousand year and the one we have imported seems to be falling apart in less than five hundred.\n\nThere must be something worth learning from India.", "description": "As I have dared question wisdom of those educated in Ivy League, it obviously meant by liberal count an absolute proof that I am a rabid Hindu Sanghi Chuddi and more!
