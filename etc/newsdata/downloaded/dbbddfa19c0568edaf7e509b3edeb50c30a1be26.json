It is one of peril for the accused, in which they are subjected to expansive definitions of sexual misconduct and little benefit of the doubt. Biden helped to bring it about as the leader of the Obama administration\u2019s cornerstone effort to end sexual assault at colleges and universities, a worthy undertaking that quickly spiraled into overreach. The goal, as Biden often says, was to remake sexual culture on campuses and in society at large\u2014a goal that\u2019s reached remarkable fruition in the #MeToo era. Now, as he mulls whether to enter the presidential race, Biden is finding himself ensnared by some of the doctrines he has advocated over the past several years.\n\nIn the past few days, Biden\u2019s not-yet candidacy has been rocked by accusations of unwanted touching. Last week, Lucy Flores, a former Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor of Nevada, said that at a campaign rally in 2014, the then-vice president, standing behind her, placed his hands on her shoulders, sniffed her hair and gave the back of her head a \u201cbig slow kiss.\u201d A few days later, Democratic former congressional aide Amy Lappos said that at a 2009 event, Biden put his hands on her face, pulled her to him and rubbed his nose with hers. This week, two more women have come forward\u2014a student who said he touched her thigh and hugged her \u201cjust a little bit too long,\u201d and a writer who said his hand strayed from her shoulder and moved down her back before her husband intervened.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThese women\u2019s accounts have been bolstered by the many circulating videos\u2014under the label \u201cCreepy Uncle Joe\u201d\u2014largely compiled from swearing-in ceremonies at which Biden presided as vice president, and where he welcomed incoming officials\u2019 families. On view is the oddly ritualized way that Biden interacts with women and girls: the hair stroking and sniffing, persistent whispering, touching and insisting that young female family members stand near him.\n\nBiden, whose spokesman did not respond to requests to comment for this article, has many defenders, including women who say they welcomed his touch. And while the accusers say they feel he violated their personal space, they generally agree that what he did was minor, and they do not call it sexual. Most everyone seems to agree that Biden\u2019s actions fall into a gray zone. And yet these gestures are raising questions about his candidacy. The New York Times\u2019 Michelle Goldberg wrote recently that she doesn\u2019t think Biden is a sexual harasser, but that the accusations and his response help to demonstrate that his \u201ctime is up.\u201d There is an irony at work here: Biden helped to make possible a world in which long-ago and trivial accusations can upend one\u2019s reputation and career.\n\nWhen Biden became vice president, one of his early acts was the announcement in June 2009 of a new position under his aegis: White House adviser on violence against women. Addressing violence against women has been career-defining for Biden. As a senator, he oversaw the passage of the Violence Against Women Act in 1994, what he calls his \u201cproudest legislative accomplishment.\u201d He continued with the cause as vice president, with the Obama administration\u2019s focus on what it said was an epidemic of sexual violence by male students against their female classmates on college campuses. Biden became the top advocate and White House point man for much of the administration\u2019s policy on the issue.\n\nThe undertaking was laudable. There is no doubt that for too long, on too many campuses, too many women who had been sexually violated and had their claims diminished or dismissed. But from the beginning, the demands the administration made on schools, and the way schools carried them out, alarmed civil libertarians.\n\nIn April 2011, Biden and Education Secretary Arne Duncan announced the release of a bombshell letter, with the bland greeting \u201cDear Colleague,\u201d to the country\u2019s 4,600 institutions of higher education. It laid out new directives for how campuses were to root out and punish sexual assault. It was the beginning of a concerted effort that radically remade how students could interact sexually, with severe penalties for those who violated increasingly expansive codes of conduct. The accused were to be judged under the lowest standards of evidence, the definitions of misconduct were widely broadened, third-party reports could trigger an investigation even if the alleged victim did not think there had been a violation, and more. Title IX is the federal law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education. Under Obama administration insistence, college offices tasked with administering Title IX became vast and powerful bureaucracies, and students were encouraged to report any perceived violation.\n\nIn a 2015 speech at Syracuse University about sexual harassment and assault, Biden made his oft-repeated assertion that, \u201cWe need a fundamental change in our culture. And the quickest place to change culture is to change it on the campuses of America.\u201d In other words, campuses were laboratories where government officials could impose their vision of how males and females should interact.\n\nAmong the cultural shifts orchestrated by the Obama administration was the assertion that evaluation of campus claims of sexual harassment and assault rest on the subjective feelings of the accuser. That meant it was irrelevant whether the accused had an intention to abuse, harm or offend. This was codified in 2013, with the joint release by the departments of Education and Justice of what they called \u201ca blueprint for colleges and universities throughout the country to protect students from sexual harassment and assault.\u201d An analysis by the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a civil liberties group, found that the administration had abandoned the principle that claims of harassment should be evaluated based on an \u201cobjective\u201d or \u201creasonable person\u201d standard.\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s efforts to expand the definitions of what constituted a possible sexual violation were thoroughgoing. In 2014, the White House issued a report called \u201cNot Alone,\u201d which provided schools with a model \u201cclimate survey\u201d that gave this definition of punishable behavior: \u201cSexual violence refers to a range of behaviors that are unwanted by the recipient and include remarks about physical appearance; persistent sexual advances that are undesired by the recipient; unwanted touching; and unwanted oral, anal, or vaginal penetration or attempted penetration.\u201d In other words, the Obama administration expanded the definition of sexual violence to include compliments, or the kind of touching\u2014often unasked for, and sometimes unwelcome\u2014that Biden has engaged in for years.\n\nBecause of all these edicts, accusations that emerged from consensual encounters, false reports or trivial contact have resulted in investigations and sometimes severe penalties for accused young men. (I wrote about some of these cases in a series in the Atlantic and in another article in Slate.) During Biden\u2019s years as vice president and since, he has characterized most of the cases adjudicated by Title IX offices as criminal in nature. But that isn\u2019t so. Instead, these disputes often arise out of sexual encounters that both parties agree began consensually\u2014often lubricated by alcohol\u2014and that turn on whether the accused explicitly got the continuous stream of consent required by the now widespread campus rule known as \u201caffirmative consent.\u201d Biden, a fervent advocate of affirmative consent, has not asked for permission from the people, often strangers, he touches. He has just assumed his touch is welcome.\n\nBiden has also failed to acknowledge that male students punished under the system he helped to create have been increasingly fighting back. They have filed more than 400 civil suits, contending that they have been unfairly accused and deprived of their rights. These suits have been getting increasingly favorable\u2014sometimes outraged\u2014rulings from judges. In a recent City Journal article, historian KC Johnson points out that \u201cBiden responded with fury to Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos\u2019 attempts to create fairer procedures for adjudicating campus sexual-assault claims.\u201d\n\nBiden continues to insist that male college students are crude brutes, ever ready to attack their female classmates. In an April 2017 interview in Teen Vogue, he said that when he explains consent to male students, they are astounded: \u201cI\u2019ve had young men on campuses say to me, \u2018I\u2019ve never thought of it that way. \u2026 As long as she wasn\u2019t screaming and kicking me and yelling help, then it was probably OK.\u2019 It\u2019s not OK. It\u2019s not OK unless she can affirmatively consent.\u201d In that same interview, he explained what he believes consent entails. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to let young men understand that without consent, meaning saying, \u2018Yes, it is OK to touch me\u2019 \u2026 then it is not consent,\u201d he said. Biden also seems to have no recognition that campus encounters can be filled with ambiguity and mixed signals. In an April 2016 speech at the University of Nevada Las Vegas, he mocked the idea that sexual assault allegations might be \u201ccomplicated,\u201d and told the assembled students that they should \u201costracize the abusers\u201d and \u201cmake them the pariah on campus.\u201d\n\nIn a statement in response to the Flores and Lappos accusations, Biden wrote, in part, that over many years, \u201cI have offered countless handshakes, hugs, expressions of affection, support and comfort. And not once\u2014never\u2014did I believe I acted inappropriately. If it is suggested I did so, I will listen respectfully. But it was never my intention.\u201d But if Joe Biden were a college student, the very stroking, smelling and touching he now characterizes as \u201cexpressions of affection\u201d\u2014ambiguous as those actions might be\u2014could easily result in his being investigated by the Title IX office, and subjected to education-disrupting punishment.\n\nAs a demonstration of the success of Biden\u2019s efforts to engender a cultural shift, he is now being told\u2014even by women of his own generation and his own party\u2014that he doesn\u2019t understand the new unwritten rules he helped to bring about. In response to the Flores accusation, Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, praised Flores\u2019 courage in telling of her encounter with Biden and said, \u201cAll of us, including the vice president, need to continue to work on changing our culture.\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who apparently understands better than Biden the new terms of engagement, said in a Politico interview this week, \u201cHe has to understand, in the world that we\u2019re in now, that people\u2019s space is important to them, and what\u2019s important is how they receive it and not necessarily how you intended it.\u201d\n\nHe now says he\u2019s gotten the message. In a video released Wednesday on Twitter, Biden explained that throughout his life he has touched people with gestures of support and solace\u2014as many have similarly reached out to him. But he understands, he said, that \u201csocial norms have begun to change. They\u2019ve shifted, and the boundaries in protecting personal space have been reset. And I get it.\u201d He said he will always believe that governing, and life, are about connecting with people\u2014but that he will adjust his own way of connecting in light of changing times.\n\nBiden appears to have been blindsided by the reaction to his own behavior, but he has been making the case that it\u2019s time to overhaul the assumptions on which our legal system is built. Just last week, at a ceremony for the Biden Courage Awards honoring student sexual assault activists, he said, \u201cThis is English jurisprudential culture, a white man\u2019s culture. It\u2019s got to change.\u201d Anglo-American jurisprudence regarding women, Biden argued, is founded on the ancient concept of \u201crule of thumb.\u201d As he explained it, in 14th-century England, a man was limited to beating his wife with a stick no bigger than the circumference of his thumb. But his assertion about the origins of that phrase is a canard. (It is thoroughly debunked in this video by American Enterprise Institute scholar Christina Hoff Sommers.)\n\nBiden is a lawyer, and once was the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, so he should know that Anglo-American jurisprudence has brought us hard-won principles such as the rule of law, due process and the presumption of innocence. Whether or not Biden makes another run for the presidency, it would be salutary if his recent, painful experience of accusation makes him consider that we should honor these principles.
