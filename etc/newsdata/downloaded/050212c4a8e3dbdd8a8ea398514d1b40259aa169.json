While the need for faster payments is real, Facebook\u2019s ambition met with a firestorm of resistance primarily because few trust it to be a responsible steward of such an important financial function.\n\nBut are big banks any more trustworthy? They have also been trying to build a new, faster payments system to dominate the way we move money among one another. Amid growing concern from smaller banks and financial technology companies over how they might wield such power, the Federal Reserve has rightly decided to step in with its own system.\n\nThe Fed steps in where the private sector failed to deliver\n\nPayments are the lifeblood of any economy. Yet the current payment system is fraught with frictions and inefficiencies. When we send money, the withdrawals from our bank accounts are usually immediate. However, it may take days for the money to go from our banks to recipients\u2019 banks where they can access the funds. A handful of financial technology startups have tried to provide real-time payment services, but they are limited networks, typically working only if both the sender and recipient are subscribers and/or have accounts at participating banks.\n\nSource: David Foster/Yahoo Finance More\n\nIn 2017, a group of large banks under the auspices of an organization called The Clearing House or TCH launched a real-time payments platform called the RTP Network. This network aspires to achieve the ubiquity lacking with fintech initiatives. It requires participating banks to pre-fund a joint account that stands behind payment transfers. Debits and credits are tracked in a centralized ledger maintained by TCH. As yet, it has failed to gain significant traction, with relatively low volumes and few banks participating beyond the big ones that own TCH.\n\nWhat\u2019s needed \u2014 but what the private sector has yet to deliver \u2014 is a trusted and universally available infrastructure that would allow banks and credit unions of all sizes to send and receive money in \u201creal time.\u201d Enter the Fed which, after years of study and public outreach, has decided to develop and launch such a system called FedNow. The Fed is already connected to almost all depository institutions in the U.S. and thus is well-positioned to provide the basic infrastructure to move money quickly between banks.\n\nNot surprisingly, the Fed\u2019s decision has been widely applauded by smaller institutions and fintechs, but roundly criticized by TCH and its advocates, who argue that FedNow will unnecessarily compete with the RTP Network and stifle innovation.\n\nCurrently, all major payments systems \u2014 including those for processing checks, facilitating direct deposits, and wire transfers \u2014 depend on both private and Fed systems. This has been the case for nearly half a century. One can hardly fault smaller depository institutions and fintechs for being wary of a system controlled by big bank competitors. For now the TCH has promised its system will be accessible to all on fair and equitable terms, but will those promises hold in the future if they achieve market dominance? The TCH website acknowledges its pricing could change if it has to \u201creact competitively.\u201d Surprisingly, while payments infrastructure has important public utility functions, the Federal Reserve lacks direct authority to regulate it. It cannot require TCH to make its system accessible to everyone or regulate its fees to prevent discriminatory pricing.", "description": "Payments are the lifeblood of any economy.
