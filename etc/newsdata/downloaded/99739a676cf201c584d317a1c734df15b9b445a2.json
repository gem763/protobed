There\u2019s also a character who we initially take to be the first female terminator (actually an \u2018augmented\u2019 super-soldier) and a young, female Mexican factory worker whose survival soon turns out to be crucial to the entire human race.\n\nBut even before we\u2019ve had time to think, \u2018Hmm, that sounds familiar\u2019, we\u2019re hit with another example of fast-changing times. When Grace \u2013 said super-soldier, played by the Canadian Mackenzie Davis \u2013 first arrives, she continues the long-standing, time-travelling terminator tradition of arriving stark naked.\n\nThere was a time when the fight that results, before she\u2019s stolen any clothes, would have aroused considerable interest in adolescent males of all ages. Now director Tim Miller, of Deadpool fame, delivers a sequence that wouldn\u2019t make a prim maiden aunt blush.\n\nLinda Hamilton is only 63, but in Hollywood years, especially female action-hero Hollywood years \u2013 surely the most unforgiving kind \u2013 that makes the original Terminator star about 157\n\nThere are two other important things you need to know. First is that while this is the sixth Terminator film to be made, in terms of franchise chronology it\u2019s actually a sequel to the excellent, Oscar-winning Terminator 2: Judgment Day.\n\nAnd second is that good ol\u2019 Arnie is back once again, digitally but briefly de-aged, as the new film loses no time in putting the central story of the first two films well and truly behind us.\n\n\u2018Skynet? What\u2019s Skynet?\u2019 asks a puzzled visitor from the future, clearly knowing nothing of the computer defence system that became self-aware and unleashed nuclear Armageddon when it perceived the human race as a threat.\n\nWell, that\u2019s the first two films out of the way.\n\nGood ol\u2019 Arnie (above with Gabriel Luna) is back once again as the new film loses no time in putting the central story of the first two films well and truly behind us\n\nThere\u2019s quite a lot to enjoy here as original director James Cameron returns to the franchise that launched his fine film-making career, this time as producer and co-writer.\n\nOur first proper glimpses of Hamilton and Schwarzenegger feel like proper moments of film history.\n\nThere are some touches of humour too, with Arnie\u2019s ageing terminator now passing himself off as human and working in soft furnishings, while Hamilton\u2019s Connor has lost none of her attitude, as becomes clear when Grace decides it\u2019s time for the feisty trio to move from Mexico to Texas.\n\nIT'S A FACT OJ Simpson was considered for The Terminator but the producers feared he was 'too nice' to be taken seriously as a killer.\n\n\u2018You want to try and cross the border with an undocumented Mexican national and a woman who had her own episode of America\u2019s Most Wanted?\u2019 asks Sarah dryly.\n\nBut none of this is quite enough to make a decently work-a-day Terminator film into a great one. Surprisingly, given that Cameron is involved, some of the visual effects aren\u2019t that convincing.\n\nThen there\u2019s the undeniable fact that neither Davis, as Grace, nor the Colombian actress Natalia Reyes, who plays Mexican Dani, exactly set the screen alight. I even found myself slightly wearying of the Terminator\u2019s endless ability to repair itself.\n\nThe main problem, however, is the sheer familiarity of the story. For while there\u2019s a certain pleasure in recognising some of the iconography of the first two films \u2013 the sunglasses, the guns, a terminator dressed as a policeman \u2013 it\u2019s disappointing to find that Cameron and his writing team have effectively written the same story all over again.\n\nWhich, when Arnie said, \u2018I\u2019ll be back\u2019, is probably not quite what he had in mind. Shame.\n\nALSO OUT THIS WEEK\n\nBlack And Blue (15)\n\nRating:\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt this grittily urban police thriller is often more style than substance, but equally there\u2019s no doubt it packs a proper punch too, tapping into the widely held belief that American police departments are racist.\n\nSo when Alicia West, a rookie black officer \u2013 played pretty well by Naomie Harris \u2013 witnesses her white superiors executing three black drug-dealers, she\u2019s in a whole heap of nasty trouble.\n\nHer corrupt white colleagues want her dead, and so do the black drugs gangs, who believe she\u2019s responsible for the killing. Thank goodness she\u2019s got the video evidence on her body-cam\u2026\n\nSome of the plotting is as clunky as the characterisation is clich\u00e9d \u2013 not only is Alicia a resourceful Afghanistan veteran but she came from the same impoverished streets in New Orleans she now patrols \u2013 but tension levels are well maintained and the film\u2019s powerful point is effectively made.\n\nThe Addams Family (PG)\n\nRating:\n\nI\u2019ve never really warmed to the Addams family, and this cartoon take on the familiar ghoulish story proves no different, despite a voice cast led by Charlize Theron and Oscar Isaac.\n\nJokes fall horribly flat and the story proves decidedly thin, as Morticia (Theron), Gomez (Isaac) and the rest of the gang move into a new home only to incur the displeasure of nosey neighbour and local gossip Margaux (Allison Janney).\n\nJokes fall horribly flat and the story proves decidedly thin, as Morticia (Charlize Theron), Gomez (Oscar Isaac) and the rest of the gang move into a new home\n\nIt\u2019s clearly aimed mainly at children, and Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz probably has the most fun as family goth Wednesday, who not only gets to go to junior high school but also discovers the colour pink. Not nearly as funny as it sounds.\n\nThe Beach Bum (18)\n\nRating:\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to know who is more indulged here, Matthew McConaughey, who plays the title character (a mumbling, drugs- and alcohol-fuelled beat-poet known as Moondog), or director and art-house favourite Harmony Korine, who has assembled a starry cast despite not having made a decent film for years.\n\nA game Isla Fisher is briefly good fun as Moondog\u2019s highly sexed wife but then the film falls apart. Look out for Zac Efron and Jonah Hill in supporting roles, both presumably hoping nobody will recognise them.", "description": "Linda Hamilton is only 63, but in Hollywood years, especially female action-hero Hollywood years - surely the most unforgiving kind - that makes the original Terminator star about 157.", "authors": ["Matthew Bond For Event Magazine"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/12/20128428-0-image-a-20_1571916003667.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
