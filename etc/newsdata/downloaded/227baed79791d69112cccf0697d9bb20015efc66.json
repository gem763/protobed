Three of the children escaped, leaving the 9-year-old behind, who was allegedly tied to a tree, shot at and assaulted.\n\nStill tormented by incident\n\nThe father of the girl previously told News24 that his daughter was tormented by what happened and asked every day when the trial would be over.\n\n\"She is scared that they will come for her again because they are free,\" he said.\n\nThe girl's father said she shudders and shivers whenever she sees a white person and hides whenever she passes by the farm where the alleged incident took place.\n\n\"If she just sees a white person, she shivers. Their farm is just on the road,\" the man said.\n\nThe men were initially refused bail. However, they were later released on bail of R3 000 after they succeeded in an appeal to the Gauteng High Court in Pretoria in October 2018.", "description": "More than two years since their arrest, the trial of farmers Johannes Potgieter and Hendrick Dumas, who allegedly handcuffed a 9-year-old girl to a tree before beating her and firing shots at her, is finally under way.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6583/dc52c17c87fe4688945c05206c168451.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
