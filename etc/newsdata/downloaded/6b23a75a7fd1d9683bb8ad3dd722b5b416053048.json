I had a heart attack in June.\n\n\u2018My son Steven died five years ago at the aged of 32 and I just want to give his two young daughters some memories of holidays at the park.\n\n\u2018I can understand that if some caravans are tatty they should get rid of them but there\u2019s nothing wrong with the caravans.\u2019\n\nA public meeting has been called outside the site launderette at 10am on Friday, October 25.\n\nJordan Hugill, 25, from Doncaster, said: \u2018We are not just fighting to keep the caravans on here, we want proper contracts, guarantees and assurances.\n\n\u2018Some people this season have been sold caravans that are 18 or 19 year old who have had letters telling them to move them.\u2019\n\nChristopher O\u2019Connor, 34, from Leeds, set up a petition on Change.org.\n\nHe said: \u2018I took my caravan on in January and it has cost me \u00a310,000 so far which I won\u2019t get back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Before I took it on I got confirmation from the park that there were no plans at all.\n\n\u2018I now get a letter saying that because it\u2019s over 20 years old there will be an inspection by the council.\n\n\u2018The kids are heartbroken because we\u2019re going to lose it.\u2019\n\nThe caravan park is owned by East Lindsey District Council but privately-run.\n\nA council spokesman said: \u2018The decision to introduce the new multi-year licences has been taken firmly with licensees and the continued sustainability of the site in mind.\n\n\u2018The longer length of the licence offers our licensees a greater peace of mind around the viability of what is a significant investment \u2013 much more so than the annual licence previously offered.\n\nSerial killer Levi Bellfield found 'minutes from death' in cell\n\n\u2018Those individuals whose caravans no longer meet the requirements for one of the new licences, are free to move their caravan to another site, we are in no way saying they must get rid of their caravan.\u2019\n\nThe statement also added that the changes would \u2018remove situations where licensees are having to pay to dispose of their old caravans or are simply walking away from them which leaves us to chase them to recover the debt\u2019.\n\nIt added: \u2018All these changes are hugely positive for Kingfisher Caravan Park and to the benefit of our licensees, with the ultimate aim of achieving 5 star accreditation from Visit England.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
