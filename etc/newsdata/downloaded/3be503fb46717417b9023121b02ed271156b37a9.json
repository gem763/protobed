As entertainment, however, it has all the charm and meaning of, um \u2026 Battle of the Network Stars. Led by Matt Gaetz this morning, a contingent of House Republicans crashed the House Democrats\u2019 star-chamber process as a protest against the lack of transparency in the quasi-kinda-semi-official impeachment inquiry:\n\nNew drama: Roughly two dozen House conservatives stormed the secure hearing room \u2013 known as the SCIF \u2013 to rail on the process, delaying the Cooper testimony. Connolly said that Louie Gohmert and Bradley Byrne were yelling in the room and railing on what they call a sham process. \u2014 Manu Raju (@mkraju) October 23, 2019\n\nUnfortunately for the Republicans, they forgot to leave their electronics behind before entering the SCIF, a big security no-no. That might have blunted their momentum a bit in disrupting the deposition process, but it still made their point about the lack of transparency in this process \u2014 except as to how Democrats keep selectively leaking testimony to the media. Why not just release the transcripts if the committee allows its members to leak like sieves?\n\nThat brings us to Devin Nunes\u2019 concerns about the process. Did Bill Taylor deliver the smoking-gun testimony House Democrats need to justify their drive for impeachment? Or did GOP Rep. John Ratcliffe \u201cdestroy\u201d the former Ukraine charges d\u2019affaires in two minutes flat, as Nunes claimed last night? We\u2019ll never know unless we see the transcripts and the tapes, and Nunes has some potentially bad news on that front as well.\n\nNote how Fox\u2019s chyron team gets successively more editorial as this interview rolls along, too (via Twitchy):\n\nRep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) on Democrats\u2019 closed-door deposition of William Taylor: \u201cThe truth is, in two minutes, John Ratcliffe destroyed this witness. There is no quid pro quo\u201d pic.twitter.com/O6yb8FFJYH \u2014 Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) October 23, 2019\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy corroborated Nunes\u2019 account. \u201cWe can\u2019t really talk about it,\u201d McCarthy tells Ingraham, but claims that \u201cthere is no quid pro quo,\u201d and that Taylor\u2019s information was secondhand at best:\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA): \"In 90 seconds, we had John Ratcliffe destroy Taylor's whole argument.\" pic.twitter.com/cNgAzLrPYB \u2014 Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) October 23, 2019\n\nGolly, that\u2019s not how the Washington Post reported it! In fact, Dan Balz intoned in his news report on Taylor\u2019s testimony that \u201c[i]t is no longer a question of whether this happened. It is now a question of how the president explains it and how lawmakers \u2014 especially Republicans \u2014 choose to respond to it.\u201d\n\nThese are two mutually exclusive positions. Either Taylor firmly established a quid pro quo in fact, or he got destroyed on cross-examination. Unfortunately for all of us, both Balz and Fox News have the same problem \u2014 they\u2019re getting their information secondhand from the partisans involved. The only way to really know what happened is to see the transcripts, and the serial leaks out of the SCIF make Schiff\u2019s security arguments a bad joke. Everyone\u2019s leaking now.\n\nNo one should trust any of these reports until we see the transcripts. In fact, no one should put any confidence in this process until it gets conducted openly, honestly, and fairly. House Republicans might have been conducting a stunt this morning, but the purpose of that stunt is spot-on. The House Democrats\u2019 star-chamber approach is an affront to justice and due process, and their conduct in using selective leaks to goose public opinion from these proceedings is nothing short of despicable. If this impeachment effort can\u2019t withstand public scrutiny and openness, then it shouldn\u2019t be conducted at all.\n\nAddendum: Breaching a SCIF is a serious problem, as this nat-sec expert explained in a Twitter thread, and shouldn\u2019t be lightly sloughed off. However \u2026\n\nA few words on why Gaetz stunt to storm the SCIF to disrupt Laura Cooper's deposition is a VERY serious national security problem. Note, I worked in that SCIF for HPSCI and handled cybersecurity issues while there. \u2014 Mieke Eoyang (@MiekeEoyang) October 23, 2019\n\nIf these proceedings truly required a SCIF, the committee members also wouldn\u2019t be discussing the proceedings in public. Furthermore, if this was truly a nat-sec investigation rather than a political activity, both Republicans and Democrats would have equal access to the transcripts and evidence, which is very much not the case now, as Nunes explains above. These committees could hold these depositions in closed session without SCIFs if closed sessions and depositions were necessary in the first place, which is also not the case. It appears that the reason Schiff chose a SCIF was to prevent Republicans from challenging the process and observing it, while allowing for his own colleagues to spin like dervishes through selective leaks about what takes place in the SCIF.\n\nTo put it bluntly: if you want to use a SCIF to conduct a clown show, don\u2019t be shocked and appalled when more clowns show up to join the act.", "description": "Nunes, McCarthy: Actually, Ratcliffe \"destroyed\" star impeachment witness on cross.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/nunes-taylor.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
