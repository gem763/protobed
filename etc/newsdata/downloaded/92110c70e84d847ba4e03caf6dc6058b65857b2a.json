She really didn\u2019t stand a chance against a herd of agitated cows.\"\n\nThe cattle have now been moved to private land with no public access routes.\n\nFollowing the inquest, the Lynchmere Society and Lynchmere Community Grazing CIC issued a joint statement.\n\nThey said: \u201cThe Lynchmere Society and Lynchmere Community Grazing are voluntary organisations who act in the interests of environmental conservation and community benefit.\n\n\u201cBoth organisations offer their sincerest condolences to Hilary\u2019s family.\n\n\u201cEveryone in the community was shocked and deeply saddened by these tragic events and the loss of a valued friend and local figure.\n\n\u201cThe safety of the public and animal welfare are of paramount importance to us.\n\n\u201cVery serious discussion between our organisations and ongoing dialogue with the family and our membership within the community will be had going forward before any decision regarding future grazing activities on the commons are made.\u201d", "description": "An 87-year-old woman walking her dog was killed by a herd of \u201cbeserk\u201d cattle in West Sussex, a coroner has heard.
