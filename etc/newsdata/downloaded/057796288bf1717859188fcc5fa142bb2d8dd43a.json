Is Going on a Big \u2018Comeback\u2019 Tour. He Hasn\u2019t Earned His Forgiveness.", "language": "en", "text": "Over the weekend, Louis C.K. returned to the email inboxes of countless former fans who no doubt forgot that they still subscribed to the disgraced comic\u2019s mailing list. An email announcing C.K.\u2019s plans to go on tour, as well as to revive his long-defunct website, made the rounds on Sunday, nearly two years after he was accused of serial sexual misconduct in a damning New York Times story. He admitted to the allegations\u2014that he masturbated in front of five women\u2014shortly thereafter.\n\n\u201cThese stories are true,\u201d C.K. said in a statement in November of 2017. \u201cAt the time, I said to myself that what I did was okay because I never showed a woman my dick without asking first, which is also true. But what I learned later in life, too late, is that when you have power over another person, asking them to look at your dick isn\u2019t a question. It\u2019s a predicament for them. The power I had over these women is that they admired me. And I wielded that power irresponsibly.\u201d\n\nWhat he did not say in his lengthy statement were the words, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nNow, apparently, the Louie actor has decided his #MeToo moment has passed, completely disregarding the fact that he should not be the one who gets to decide. The mailing-list email, sent with the subject line, \u201can update from Louis CK,\u201d begins, \u201cYou may have noticed that louisck.com (that\u2019s my website) has been down for a while. This is because I\u2019m redesigning the site (I mean someone talented who I hired is).\u201d He explains that the full website will be back up \u201cin a month or so.\u201d\n\nSeemingly as an afterthought, he writes, \u201cAlso I am on tour doing stand up (sic) comedy around the country and planet.\u201d Indeed, a visit to C.K.\u2019s website as it currently exists yields a similar message about his stand-up tour with links to purchase tickets. The 14-city international tour stretches through January 2020 and includes stops in Virginia, North Carolina, Israel, and Italy, among other locations.\n\nC.K.\u2019s attempt at a comeback comes as no surprise\u2014the 52-year-old has been planting the seeds of a return for just over a year now. In August of 2018, he made a surprise appearance at the famed Greenwich Village institution the Comedy Cellar, where he did a 15-minute set. The club\u2019s owner, Noam Dworman, told The New York Times that C.K. was met with a standing ovation from the audience before he even began performing. \u201cI had thought that the first time he\u2019d go on would be in a more controlled environment,\u201d Dworman told the Times, \u201cBut he decided to just rip the Band-Aid off.\u201d According to the article, Dworman received only one complaint via phone call following the impromptu appearance.\n\n\u201c The more pressing reason that C.K. does not deserve to be let off the hook so easy is that in the now two years since the explosive news broke, the comedian has done little, if anything at all, to express remorse. \u201d\n\nThough the misconduct scandal resulted in HBO and Netflix cutting ties with the comic and his retrospectively disastrous, Woody Allen-inspired film I Love You Daddy being dropped, the male stand-up community that made C.K. a star in the first place appeared willing to embrace his return. He made a series of appearances at the Comedy Cellar, as well as other clubs around the country. In spite of Dworman\u2019s claims that no one at the club on that fateful night in August seemed bothered by Louis C.K.\u2019s return to the stage, the headline-making moment launched an impassioned debate about whether or not the admitted predator\u2019s comeback was occurring \u201ctoo soon.\u201d\n\nThe timing of his reluctant tiptoe back into the spotlight feels less relevant now\u2014although he did set himself up for such critique by ending his November 2017 statement with \u201cI will now step back and take a long time to listen.\u201d (Does 10 months constitute a long time? Two years? Who gets to decide?) Questions of timing aside, the more pressing reason that C.K. does not deserve to be let off the hook so easy is that in the now two years since the explosive news broke, the comedian has done little, if anything at all, to express remorse. He has not publicly uttered those two crucial words, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He has not made an effort to reach out to his victims directly, or the formidable female comedy community in general, to seek their forgiveness, or their counsel.\n\nHe has, however, made jokes about the controversy on stage. Back in January during a set in San Jose, California, C.K. remarked, \u201cI like to jerk off, and I don\u2019t like being alone.\u201d As Stacey Solie wrote for The Daily Beast, his delivery was \u201csimple and without a trace of apology; it got a good laugh.\u201d Prior to that, a leaked set of his saw the comic mocking the Parkland shooting survivors and gender identity. If he is able to successfully mount a comeback by perpetuating this kind of brash dismissiveness on tour, it will send the grim message that joking about doing something terrible is the same thing as apologizing and taking responsibility for it.", "description": "The famed comic, who confessed to serial sexual misconduct after many women came forward, announced a new comedy tour.
