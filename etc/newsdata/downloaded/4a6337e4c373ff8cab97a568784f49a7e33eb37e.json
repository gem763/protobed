Ah, enjoy the show, Hugh Jackman.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s not all that clear what Hugh had done, however the two have been going back and forth with hurtful barbs for months and months, nay, years now.\n\nRyan\u2019s message is beautiful (Picture: Rex Features)\n\nHe then launched himself into a stirring rendition of happy birthday, that, frankly, is worthy of being on Broadway.\n\nWhich is exactly what Ryan thought, as he ended the sweet message by turning it hilariously venomous.\n\n\u2018And I\u2019m not even f**king professionally-trained, Jackman, you piece of s**t mother**ker,\u2019 Ryan yelled at the camera, as he flipped Hugh the bird.\n\nOf course it made it all the way to Hugh\u2019s eyes, as the actor and Broadway star shared the video to Twitter for the world to see.\n\nThe pair have been in a troll war\u2026and it\u2019s glorious (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nHe captioned it: \u2018At first I thought \u2013 Ugh, now I actually have to apologize. But then \u2026 @VancityReynolds.\u2019\n\nYeah, no need for an apology.\n\nThe Wolverine actor and Ryan have been at war in a terribly sarcastic and hilarious way for years over Ryan\u2019s insistence Hugh return to his Logan ways so the two Marvel comics characters can star in a film together.\n\nIt\u2019s a simple ask that\u2019s gone to the extremes with a fair amount of brilliant trolling, all for our entertainment.\n\nThe two have been the ultimate fighters (like, Jake Gyllenhaal is even in on this), but back in February, they appeared to put it all behind them as they called a truce. We thought it would all be over and peace would be restored, with Ryan reaching out to The Greatest Showman with an olive branch of sorts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaking to Twitter, he wrote: \u2018As a gesture of goodwill, I\u2019m gonna make a beautiful ad for his company, Laughing Man Coffee. Can\u2019t wait!\u2019\n\nIn the aptly-titled video, \u2018Truce\u2019, the two made an ad for one another\u2019s company \u2013 Ryan\u2019s being Aviator Gin, and Hugh\u2019s Laughing Man Coffee. Of course, that didn\u2019t go to plan at all and the truce was definitely not upheld when Hugh trolled Ryan big time.\n\nAh, when will it end with these two?\n\nNever, we hope.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
