What's next? Recorded Oct. 14, 2019 at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wis. Dave Birkett and Jeff Seidel, Detroit Free Press\n\nIt seemed like everybody had something to say after the Detroit Lions' controversial 23-22 loss to the Green Bay Packers.\n\nBut Dan Orlovsky had some of the most pointed comments of the past 24 hours.\n\nThe former Lions quarterback ripped the NFL on ESPN's \"Get Up!\" morning show for what he called an \"epidemic\" in officiating and called for the league's owners to stand up for fixing it.\n\n\"Owners, I'm talking to you,\" Orlovsky said. \"You don't have a problem. You have an epidemic. Your product is slowly being ruined by a third party that has no consequence to their actions. You may not pay a lot of attention to social media, but you should. Because not thousands of people, not tens of thousands of people, but millions of people are unhappy right now. And unhappy people don't spend money. America's favorite sport, at times, is becoming unwatchable because of bad officiating. And it's not an October 2020 fix, it's not a 2020 fix. It's an October 15th, 2019 morning fix.\n\n\"Your product is being ruined. You need to fix this now. That's the reality of this situation. We can no longer come on shows after a really good football game and have to talk about the bad officiating. The Detroit Lions fans and team should not have to go, 'Oh, we should've played better.' ... (The officials are) impacting too many football games. And I'm telling you, fans are sick of it.\"\n\nOrlovsky proposed one fix: Whenever a penalty flag is thrown, have an official in the booth work to confirm it's a penalty in real time.\n\n\"It's timeless. You don't have to waste time on it,\" he said. \"But we can't consistently go, 'Hey, sorry guys, we were wrong.'\"\n\nOrlovsky played for the Lions from 2005-08, then again in 2014-16, primarily as a backup quarterback. He completed 58.2% of his passes in his career for 3,132 yards, 15 touchdowns and 13 interceptions. He started in 7 games for the 2008 Lions that went 0-16.\n\nContact Brian Manzullo: bmanzullo@freepress.com.", "description": "Dan Orlovsky calls for NFL to fix its officiating and for owners to stand up, says it's driving people away and ruining football", "authors": ["Brian Manzullo", "Published P.M.
