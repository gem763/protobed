The law codifies a 2018 state supreme court ruling, and applies it to a wide range of state laws. It could upend the business models of companies that depend on armies of independent contractors, who aren\u2019t guaranteed employment protections like minimum wage and overtime.\n\nThe bill is slated to go into effect on Jan. 1. While the legislature has adjourned until next year, fierce lobbying and deal-making efforts are expected to continue in the meantime, and could potentially yield separate legislation in 2020.\n\nIn a statement, Newsom called the bill \"landmark legislation,\" and said that, \"A next step is creating pathways for more workers to form a union, collectively bargain to earn more, and have a stronger voice at work\u2014all while preserving flexibility and innovation.\" Lorena Gonzalez, the state assemblywoman who authored the bill, said in a statement that, \u201cCalifornia is now setting the global standard for worker protections for other states and countries to follow.\u201d\n\nTech companies including the ride-hailing giants have tried unsuccessfully over the past year to secure concessions that would shield them from having to reclassify their workers, including holding talks with union leaders about potential compromises that would extend new perks to workers while preventing them from becoming employees. Newsom, a Democrat seen as friendly to both tech and labor, has publicly and privately urged a deal, but so far hasn\u2019t been able to get one.\n\nAn Uber spokesman expressed the company\u2019s disappointment on Wednesday. \u201cWe've engaged in good faith with the Legislature, the Newsom administration and labor leaders for nearly a year on this issue,\u201d he said in a statement, \u201cand we believe California is missing a real opportunity to lead the nation by improving the quality, security and dignity of independent work.\u201d\n\nNewsom said Wednesday that he would convene labor, business and legislative leaders, to discuss how California could \"support innovation and a more inclusive economy,\u201d by stepping in where the federal government had \u201cfallen short,\u201d to grant workers the \u201cright to organize and collectively bargain.\u201d\n\nPrivate sector unionization is generally governed by federal law rather than the states. But some labor advocates believe that the exclusion of many gig workers from federal protections creates an opportunity for states like California to establish their own unionization system. Others are hopeful that A.B. 5 itself, by forcing changes to companies\u2019 business models, could make it easier for workers to qualify as employees under federal labor law as well.\n\nIf no compromise is reached, Uber, Lyft and DoorDash Inc. have each committed $30 million to put a referendum on the 2020 ballot. In the meantime, Uber has signaled it will keep aggressively defending its position that its drivers are not employees, even under the new law. \u201cJust because the test is hard does not mean we will not be able to pass it,\u201d Uber Chief Legal Officer Tony West told reporters last week.\n\nA spokesman for Lyft said it was hopeful the company could work with the governor\u2019s office to \u201creach a historic agreement,\u201d but added, \u201cif necessary we are prepared to take this issue to the voters to preserve the freedom and access drivers and passengers want.\u201d\n\n(Updates with comments starting in the fourth paragraph. )\n\nTo contact the author of this story: Josh Eidelson in Palo Alto at jeidelson@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Anne VanderMey at avandermey@bloomberg.net, Mark MilianAndrew Pollack\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- California Governor Gavin Newsom signed\u00a0a sweeping new law that could force gig companies like Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc. to reclassify their workers as employees.The hotly contested legislation, Assembly Bill 5, dictates that workers can generally only be considered contractors", "authors": ["Josh Eidelson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TJYWcLC8lozkZ9NNkH59ag--~B/aD0xMjIyO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_technology_68/053cc97262f70943b70d6eafbe6e30f3", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
