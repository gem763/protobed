The video below shows how a port scan, the nmap tool, and ncrack could be used to infiltrate the system.\n\nThe team was able to connect and brute-force the radio within only 10 minutes due to lax password security, granting them root access with full privileges.\n\nCNET: Defense Department wants Apple, Google to reveal names of gun scope app users, report says\n\n\"For testing we edited some of the folders, created files, and modified paths to see what we are able to change in the native source of the application,\" Kunz says. \"Finally, we were able to edit and access everything on the box and had the ability to fully compromise the smart web radio device.\"\n\nPossible attacks included changing device names, forcing a play stream, saving audio files as messages, and to transmit audio as commands both locally and remotely.\n\nOn Facebook, the security researcher said over one million devices may be at risk.\n\nWhile the single compromise of an IoT radio may not seem like a big security issue, the disclosure highlights a problem that impacts all of us -- the enslavement of IoT devices to create larger threats. As an example, Mirai botnet variants specialize in hijacking IoT devices with open ports or weak security -- such as those using default credentials -- in order to launch powerful distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.\n\nTechRepublic: How to prevent a Corporate Account Takeover\n\nIt is also possible to harness these vulnerabilities to spread malware or to deface devices.\n\nVulnerability-Lab notified Telestar Digital GmbH of its research on June 1. Within a week, the vendor responded to the report and a patch was ready by August 30, leading to the coordinated public disclosure.\n\nThe telnetd service is being changed and the lax password use has been revised. Automatic updates via Wi-Fi are now available and can be implemented by setting impacted devices back to factory settings and accepting downloads of the latest firmware version.\n\nTelestar Digital GmbH is not aware of any examples of the vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild.\n\nPrevious and related coverage\n\nHave a tip?
