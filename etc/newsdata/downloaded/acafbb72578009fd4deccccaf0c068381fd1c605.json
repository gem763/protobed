No. 8 Afaesetiti Amosa left Japan, his tournament over because of a ruptured right knee ligament, and center Rey Lee-Lo and hooker Motu Matu\u2019u each received three-match bans for dangerous tackles to rule them out of the rest of the group stage.\n\nMatu\u2019u was effectively already out of the Scotland game with a concussion, so his ban will extend to the quarterfinals, should Samoa make it. Scrumhalf Dwayne Polataivao also missed out on selection for the game against Scotland after Samoa said he had a suspected concussion. Jack Lam is back to captain Samoa, though, replacing Amosa at No. 8.\n\nWhile Samoan spirits have been dampened by those injury and disciplinary issues, Scotland\u2019s morale was nearly crushed by Ireland.\n\nThe Scots were ultra-disappointing to be drubbed 27-3 by their Six Nations rivals in Yokohama. Ireland\u2019s forwards bullied a meek Scotland to set up the convincing win.\n\nIt led to three days of soul-searching in the Scottish camp and the added pressure of a stinging reaction by fans and media back home. Scotland\u2019s players must snap out of it because there\u2019s no time to stew on Ireland with the challenges ahead: Samoa, Russia and then host Japan in their final Pool A game, which could well decide who goes through to the quarterfinals. Ireland was upset by Japan on Saturday night, lifting the hosts into top spot in Pool A.\n\n\u201cThe aftermath wasn\u2019t very nice,\u201d flanker John Barclay said of Scotland\u2019s loss to the Irish. \u201cThe first couple of days were pretty crap. You analyze it, over-analyze it and go over it and over it again. It\u2019s something we don\u2019t take lightly.\n\n\u201c(But) We\u2019re not going to sit in our hotel rooms and cry for a week. We can\u2019t do that. So, we\u2019ve been out exploring. We\u2019re here at a World Cup, it\u2019s a great opportunity, and we\u2019ve got another opportunity on Monday against Samoa.\u201d\n\nScotland players accepted that the performance against Ireland meant all of them were in danger of losing their places. Their heads were on the block is how they described it. Coach Gregor Townsend resisted the urge to swing the axe too much. He made five swaps, the most significant was picking a new backrow trio in Jamie Ritchie and Magnus Bradbury on the flanks and Blade Thomson at No. 8.\n\n\u201cThe reality is we now have to win our next three games to make it out of our pool, so the knockout stages for us begin this Monday night,\u201d Townsend said.\n\nScotland will brace for a typically bruising challenge from Samoa, which went a little over the top against Russia. Lee-Lo and Matu\u2019u were both yellow-carded within two minutes of each other for dangerous high tackles on Russia captain Vasily Artemyev, who managed to get up after both.\n\nScotland scrumhalf Greig Laidlaw said the referee in Kobe, Pascal Gauzere of France, should be prepared to dish out red cards if Samoa keeps dishing out high tackles.\n\nHigh, dangerous tackles have made news in Japan after the first week of games. Australia\u2019s Reece Hodge was the first player banned for one, there were the two from the Samoans, England\u2019s Piers Francis has been cited for one, and American flanker John Quill was sent off for one, the only red of the tournament so far.\n\nThe dangers are obvious. Fiji flanker Peceli Yato sustained a concussion and left the field after Hodge\u2019s shoulder-led hit to his head in the Australia-Fiji game in Sapporo. Yato said he momentarily blacked out after the tackle and has been suffering from headaches, dizziness and fatigue.\n\nOn the two Samoan tackles on Russia\u2019s Artemyev, Laidlaw said: \u201cThey were two clear head shots and pretty brutal ones at that.\u201d\n\nLaidlaw said he thought they should have been red cards.\n\n\u201cUltimately you are looking for the ref to look after players.\u201d\n\nSamoa has another shot at Scotland at the Rugby World Cup after they met in the last tournament, and the Scots escaped with a 36-33 pool-stage win.\n\nAs England coach Eddie Jones and others have noted, the second-tier teams are \u201cplaying for their lives\u201d at the Rugby World Cup, the only time they get such broad international exposure. Samoa hasn\u2019t made the quarterfinals since 1995.\n\n\u201cWe talk about putting Samoa back on the map in the World Cup,\u201d Samoa winger Alapati Leiua said.\n\n___\n\nLineups:\n\nScotland: Stuart Hogg, Darcy Graham, Chris Harris, Sam Johnson, Sean Maitland, Finn Russell, Greig Laidlaw; Blade Thomson, Jamie Ritchie, Magnus Bradbury, Jonny Gray, Grant Gilchrist, Willem Nel, Stuart McInally (captain), Allan Dell.
