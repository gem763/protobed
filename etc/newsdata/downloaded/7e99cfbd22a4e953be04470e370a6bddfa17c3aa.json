Mobile phones sold there already have Facebook installed.\n\nAs Facebook\u2019s presence in Myanmar grew in recent years, the company did not address what the BSR report calls a \u201ccrisis of digital literacy\u201d in a country that was just emerging from a military dictatorship and where the internet was still new.\n\nMany citizens in Myanmar, the report says, still do not know the basics of the internet \u2014 from using a browser to setting up an email account \u2014 and are not equipped to distinguish real information from rumor. The report warns that this could continue to be a problem for Facebook, especially during the country\u2019s general elections in 2020.\n\nNew problems could also arise related to WhatsApp, the messaging app owned by Facebook that is becoming popular in Myanmar.\n\nWhatsApp has begun to play a leading role in elections, particularly in developing countries where it is being used by political parties, religious activists and others to spread information. In India\u2019s recent elections, some WhatsApp messages were used to incite tensions while others were found to be false.\n\nIn Myanmar, the prevalence of hate speech, disinformation and bad actors on Facebook \u201chas had a negative impact on freedom of expression, assembly and association for Myanmar\u2019s most vulnerable users,\u201d the report says. This has led to the suppression of free speech; violence and hate campaigns; and self-censorship by women, minorities and other vulnerable members of society.\n\nMyanmar military officials were behind a systematic campaign on Facebook to target a mostly Muslim Rohingya minority, an investigation by The New York Times found. Human rights groups say this campaign has led to murder, rape and forced migration.", "description": "The company, citing a human rights report it commissioned, said it was moving to prevent further abuses of its platform in Myanmar.
