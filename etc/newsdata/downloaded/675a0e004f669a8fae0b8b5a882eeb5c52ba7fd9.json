Anglia Ruskin University said Mr Ho's conduct 'has caused increasing concern'\n\nMr Ho was booted out of a meeting in the city's Legislative Council earlier this month after insulting pro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo (pictured). He accused her of 'habitually eating foreign sausage', referring to the fact that Ms Mo is married to an Englishman\n\nPiece of rubbish #JuniusHo calls, at #Hongkong legislature open meeting, some people \u201chabitually eating foreign sausage\u201d.\n\nSuch so-called lawmaker must be trashed pic.twitter.com/Hl76C0Ql9r \u2014 Claudia Mo \u6bdb\u5b5f\u975c (@ClaudiaMCMo) October 15, 2019\n\nThe lawmaker - no stranger to drama - also had to face investigation in 2017 after claiming the city's pro-independence activists should be 'killed mercilessly'.\n\nHe described the revocation as 'political repression in the open'.\n\nMr Ho was awarded an honorary doctorate degree in law in 2011 by Anglia Ruskin University, which at the time described him as 'a top name in law who has achieved great success'.\n\nBut the institute today confirmed that it had withdrawn the degree from Mr Ho because his conduct had 'caused increasing concern'.\n\nThe university said: 'ARU's honorands must be positive role models to our students, alumni and staff, and to the communities we serve.'\n\nIt added: 'Mr Ho's conduct since he was honoured has caused increasing concern. Following an investigation, the university has withdrawn Mr Ho's honorary degree.'\n\nThe university did not specify the incidents or comments that had led to the decision.\n\nHowever last week, crossbench peer Lord Alton of Liverpool wrote to the university, demanding that the institute withdraw Mr Ho's degree.\n\nBenedict Rogers, chairman of UK-based human rights group Hong Kong Watch, shared Lord Alton's letter on Twitter.\n\nLord Alton has written to @AngliaRuskin University, to urge them to withdraw honorary doctorate of Hong Kong legislator Junius Ho, who has long record of shocking racist,bigoted,violent language with genocidal tones.

Mr Ho can be heard in the video praising the suspects as his 'heroes'\n\nMr Rogers, a human rights activist specialising in Asia, supported the university's decision.\n\nHe said: 'Anglia Ruskin University has made exactly the right decision, and has responded with impressive speed. I welcome their decision.'\n\nHe added: 'Junius Ho's long-standing track record of hate-filled, racist, bigoted, violent speech, sometimes with genocidal tones, is completely unacceptable and no respectable institution should be associated with him, let alone honour him.'\n\nMr Ho claimed Lord Alton's accusations were untruthful.\n\n'He only knew hearsay and did not probe the facts, [that was] very careless,' he told China's state-run Global Times, calling the incident 'regrettable'.\n\nHe also threatened legal actions.\n\nIn a statement on China's Twitter-like Weibo, Mr Ho expressed his disappointment in the university, claiming it had withdrawn his degree without checking Lord Alton's allegations with him.\n\nMr Ho was awarded an honorary degree in law in 2011 by Anglia Ruskin University (pictured). The university had described him as 'a top name in law who has achieved great success'\n\n'The member of the House of Lords brazenly intervened and openly put pressure on the university to crack down on freedom of speech enjoyed by a Chinese Hong Konger through the [Hong Kong] Basic Law,' Mr Ho wrote in reference to Lord Alton's complaint.\n\n'This is political repression in the open and abuse of academic freedom and autonomy.'\n\n'My behaviour and comments reflect the truth and facts and [I] dare to fight Hong Kong separatists and hanjians,' Mr Ho added, using a derogatory term for race traitors to the Han Chinese.\n\nRiot police stand off against protesters during a demonstration against alleged police brutality on Sunday. Hong Kong has been battered by nearly five months of pro-democracy protests\n\nThe city's Chief Executive Carrie Lam today said there would be no political solution until the violent protests end. 'For the government to resort to measures that will appease the violent rioters, I don't think that is the solution,' Mrs Lam told reporters\n\nMr Ho said it was heart-breaking for him to see that academic repression and political unfairness had taken place in UK where democracy was held highly.\n\nEarlier this month, Mr Ho was kicked out of a meeting in the city's Legislative Council after claiming that Claudio Mo, a lawmaker from the pro-democracy camp, was 'used to eating foreign sausage'.\n\nThe term is a common insult in Cantonese against women who have romantic relationships with foreign men.\n\nMs Mo is married to Philip Bowring, a renowned British journalist who has reported from Asia for nearly 40 years.\n\nShe called Mr Ho's description of her 'blatantly sexist and racist'.", "description": "Junius Ho was\u00a0awarded an honorary doctorate degree in law in 2011 by Anglia Ruskin University, which at the time described him as 'a top name in law who has achieved great success'.", "authors": ["Billie Thomson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/16/20332382-0-image-a-89_1572365071867.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
