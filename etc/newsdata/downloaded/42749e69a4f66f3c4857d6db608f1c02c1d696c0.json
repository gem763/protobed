A veto there would mean the text agreed last week by EU leaders and the U.K. government could be dismissed. That could in turn trigger a no-deal Brexit or send negotiators back to the drawing board.\n\nThe EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has made a point of keeping MEPs closely in the loop since the beginning of the Brexit talks \u2014 including during weekly meetings with the Parliament's Brexit Steering Group. Much of the new deal will therefore not come as a surprise for many MEPs.\n\nBut there were significant changes in the final days of the talks and MEPs may resent the fact that they\u2019re being asked to ratify a deal they haven\u2019t had time to properly scrutinize.\n\nMichel Barnier has made a point of keeping MEPs closely in the loop since the beginning of the Brexit talks.\n\nOn top of that, MEPs have already shown through the recent confirmation hearings for the next Commission that they\u2019re willing to rebel against EU leaders\u2019 wishes on important matters.\n\nHere\u2019s POLITICO\u2019s guide on the European Parliament\u2019s role in Brexit:\n\nWhen will the European Parliament vote on the deal?\n\nNot until after the deal passes in Westminster. MEPs adopted a resolution in September that said \"it will not proceed with any consent vote until the U.K. Parliament has approved an agreement with the EU.\"\n\nIn a statement released Monday night by Parliament President David Sassoli after a meeting of the legislature's top political body, the Conference of Presidents, he reiterated the point twice. \"The European Parliament will be the final actor to have its say on this matter,\" he wrote, confirming that the process of examining the deal \u2014 first in the Constitutional Affairs Committee \u2014 would now begin.\n\n\"The European Parliament will be the final actor to have its say on this matter.\" \u2014 David Sassoli, in a statement\n\nThe Parliament is sitting in full this week in Strasbourg but the next plenary session is not scheduled until November, after the October 31 Brexit deadline. If British MPs pass the deal between this Thursday and the exit date of October 31, the European Parliament could call an extraordinary meeting so MEPs could vote on the deal in time.\n\nTo pass, the deal will need a simple majority.\n\nWho\u2019s for the deal?\n\nMost political groups are still waiting to see what happens in the U.K. to take an official position, although up to this point MEPs have overwhelmingly supported positions taken by the European Council in the Brexit process. They have voted by large majorities in favor of the Parliament's five Brexit resolutions.\n\nThe European Parliament\u2019s two biggest groups \u2014 the center-right European People\u2019s Party and the center-left Socialists & Democrats \u2014 are largely expected to vote for the deal, though they are still waiting to take a stance. But these two groups don't hold a majority in Parliament, and certain British Labour members of the S&D are dead set against the deal.\n\nStill, many groups \u2014 the EPP in particular which has no British MEPs within it \u2014 say they\u2019re eager to pass the agreement to get the Brexit process over with.\n\nA spokesperson for the liberal Renew Europe group said there would be \"no vote in the Parliament as long as the agreement is not ratified on the U.K. side,\" adding that \"we must take our time for a serious analysis of the agreement.\"\n\nThe four Conservative MEPs (out of 73 from the U.K. in total) will approve the deal once it is passed in Westminster, a spokesperson for the European Conservatives and Reformists group said. The leader of the Tory group, Geoffrey van Orden, described the deal as \"brilliant\" last week.\n\nWho\u2019s against it?\n\nUnsurprisingly: British opposition parties. Even if the deal manages to overcome naysayers in the House of Commons, it will have to face off against those same defiant groups once more in the EU chamber.\n\nThe Euroskeptic Brexit Party, Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party, the pro-EU Liberal Democrats and independent MEPs look set to vote against the deal.\n\nThough Labour MEPs belong to the Socialists & Democrats group in the European Parliament, some may deviate from the rest of the group. Richard Corbett, a senior Labour MEP, told POLITICO he would vote against the deal, as it is \"a bad deal for Britain and a bad deal for the EU\" and \"would create a distant relationship between Britain and Europe.\"\n\nAlyn Smith, an MEP from the Scottish National Party and vice president of the Greens group in the European Parliament, said that if the deal passes in the House of Commons, \"we'll vote against it.\"\n\n\"I appreciate EU27 has to look after EU27 interests, but my job is to stop Brexit or go down fighting,\" Smith added. The Greens group will discuss its position during internal meetings this week.\n\nRichard Corbett, a senior Labour MEP, told POLITICO he would vote against the deal, as it is \"a bad deal for Britain and a bad deal for the EU.\"\n\nChris Davies, a member of the U.K.'s Liberal Democrats and of the pan-EU Renew Europe group, said his voters in the U.K. \"don't want this deal.\"\n\n\"They don't want any deal,\" Davies said. \"They want to remain citizens of the European Union. They want Britain to be a leader in Europe, not a leaver.\"\n\nIn the European Parliament on Tuesday, Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said the agreement reduces U.K. to the status of being a colony of the EU. He accused Johnson of trying to \"bounce us into this new treaty,\" adding \"It\u2019s about the Tory Party, not about the country.\"\n\nFarage added that he had hoped this would be his last speech in the European Parliament, but \"I have a feeling we\u2019ll be back in November.\"\n\nWhat issues might MEPs object to?\n\nBernd Lange, the chair of the European Parliament\u2019s trade committee, warned last week that the Withdrawal Agreement creates holes in the single market which open up the bloc to a risk of dumping \u2014 infiltration of low-cost goods produced to lower standards.\n\n\u201cThe solution on differentiated treatment is not doable,\u201d he told POLITICO in reference to a provision in the new agreement under which goods shipped from Great Britain to Northern Ireland would be treated differently depending on the likelihood of whether they would end up in the EU. However, Lange noted that these problems would need to be resolved through a future trade deal, and predicted that the Parliament would support the Withdrawal Agreement simply to get Brexit done.\n\nIn the Parliament's debate on Tuesday, Brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadt said he still has concerns over the treatment of EU27 citizens living in the U.K. \"We need to use the time between now and the consent vote to solve the problems that still exist today with the rights of EU citizens that are living in the U.K.,\" he said.\n\nBernd Lange predicts that the European Parliament would support the Withdrawal Agreement simply to get Brexit done.\n\nHe cited four issues: the rights of 200,000 vulnerable citizens; potential deportations of citizens who miss the deadline for applying for so-called settled status (the new scheme for EU27 citizens living in the U.K.); concerns over the difference between pre-settled and settled status; and the independence of the monitoring authority set up to police the system. \"We don\u2019t want EU citizens to become victims in another Windrush scandal in Britain. That cannot happen,\" he said, referring to a series of incorrect deportations of British citizens who had migrated to the country decades ago from the Caribbean.\n\nMartin Schirdewan, the co-leader of the GUE/NGL Group in the European Parliament and a member of the Brexit Steering Group told the Parliament Magazine that after examining the deal, he \"still have concerns about Brexit\u2019s impact upon the Irish peace process and citizens\u2019 rights.\u201d\n\nWhat happens if MEPs reject the deal?\n\nThis scenario looks unlikely because of Barnier's efforts to cultivate MEPs throughout the negotiations, but if it happened it would throw the Brexit process into chaos. The precise impact is hard to predict because this is uncharted territory, but if a rejection happened in a vote ahead of October 31 then it could trigger a no-deal Brexit.", "description": "A rubber-stamp from MEPs isn\u2019t guaranteed.", "authors": ["Ma\u00efa De La Baume", "Emilio Casalicchio"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1176573542-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
