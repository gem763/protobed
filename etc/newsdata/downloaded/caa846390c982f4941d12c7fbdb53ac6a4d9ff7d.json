I think the current draft is largely complete,\u201d Lodge said, when asked about prospects of adopting the rules by next July.\n\nOne of the issues yet to be agreed is proportionate financial payments to the Jamaica-based ISA for subsea mineral exploitation outside national waters.\n\n\u201cWe are looking at ad valorem royalty that would be based on the value of the ore at a point of extraction ... The middle range is 4% to 6% ad valorem royalty, potentially increasing over time,\u201d Lodge said.\n\nIf the rules are approved, it could take about two to three years to obtain permits to start deep sea mining under the current draft, Lodge said.\n\nCanadian Nautilus Minerals had tried to mine underwater mounds for copper and gold in the national waters off Papua New Guinea, but it run out of money and had to file for creditor protection earlier this year.\n\nThis has not deterred others, such as Global Sea Mineral Resources (GSR), a unit of Belgian group DEME, and Canada\u2019s DeepGreen, to continue technology tests and research.\n\nIn July, Greenpeace called for a 10-year moratorium on deep sea mining to learn more about its potential impact on deep sea ecosystems, but the ISA has rejected such a proposal.", "description": "China is likely to become the first country in the world to start mining seabed minerals if the international rules for exploitation are approved next year, the head of the International Seabed Authority (ISA) said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
