I do like a dinner date, but something fun preferably.\"\n\nWhen it comes to her own relationships, Summer values old fashioned qualities.\n\nAsked what she looks for in a man, she said: \"I would say that for a successful relationship to work you'd need a mutual respect for each other, trust for each other and loyalty for each other.\"\n\nSummer also \"100%\" wants kids, so long as it's with \"one billion per cent the right person.\"", "description": "Summer answered questions about her life that fans had sent in and also dealt some relationship wisdom", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Instagram", "Splashnews.Com"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20713763.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_SUMMER.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
