Pictured, stock image\n\nVALUABLE TIP\n\nThe most valuable tip I've ever learned was from Laura Mercier herself - and that was an eyeliner technique.\n\nWhen applying mascara it is very hard to get it right to the roots, especially if you have blonde hair. You can end up with blonde roots and dark tips which makes the eyelashes look shorter.\n\nUsing a thin flat brush and a cake eyeliner (such as the Laura Mercier Black Ebony Cake Eyeliner), wet the brush and apply the liner from underneath the top lash line onto where the hair meets the skin.\n\nThis is also a great tip for anyone with hooded eyes, where liquid eyeliner may transfer.\n\nPAMELA ANDERSON'S FAVOURITE EYEBROW PENCIL\n\nI am often asked about my time working with Pamela as her make-up artist. Pamela is naturally beautiful with well-proportioned features and it was always a pleasure to do her make-up.\n\nFor Pamela's brows I would always use MAC eyebrows styler in the colour 'Lingering'. It would stay put all day and is so easy to use.\n\nPamela liked a dramatic smoky eye so we always went with a nude lip - my top tip is to pick a focus - eyes or lips, don't do both.\n\nFor a long-lasting, very natural hint of colour, I would use a cotton bud to apply a small amount of Benefit's Benetint, which would stain the lips a very light pink - and compliment the smoky eye. A Toffee Kryolan lip gloss was another of her favourites.\n\nWHAT LAURA MERCIER TAUGHT ME\n\nThe more time you spend on achieving a flawless face, the less you will have to do with colours and eye shadows.\n\nLa Voix (pictured), from the UK, has shared some of her beauty secrets to help anyone achieve a touch of celebrity glam\n\nThe base is so important; get that right and the rest will follow.\n\nPeople think the girls on the beauty counters are out to sell only, but take some time to visit them and they can find the right match for you.\n\nLaura always used to say: 'You want people to say, \"You have lovely skin,\" and not, \"What foundation are you wearing?\"' which is so very true!\n\nHOW TO MAKE CONCEALER MOST EFFECTIVE\n\nGetting a colour that matches your skin is obviously the first thing you need to do - but it is amazing how many people I see who don't.\n\nAnd you need a more liquid concealer for under the eye, not a thick-stick one!\n\nA great one for under the eyes is Nars Radiant Creamy Concealer (I use the colour Custard). This will glide on under the eyes making you look refreshed and hide any dark circles.\n\nA great one for the face is Laura Mercier Secret Camouflage - this compact comes with two colours which you can mix to get the perfect shade for you.\n\nThen, if you tan in summer and lose it in winter, you can adjust your colour using just the one compact.\n\nIf you have a pimple, apply the secret camouflage with a brush directly onto it - do not brush side to side to blend, just put it on the top. This will prevent highlighting any of the areas around the spot and hide the little devil!\n\nBLENDING LIKE A PRO\n\nBeauty blender sponges all day long. Don't use them dry, you must wet them. They don't absorb any foundation, so you don't lose any product and they give you a flawless base.\n\nCOMMON MAKE-UP MISTAKES\n\nContouring! Only do it if you need to. If you have cheekbones like Naomi Campbell there is no need to heavily contour underneath them.\n\nTOP SELFIE TIP Avoid any foundation or tinted moisturiser with a shimmer, radiance or even worse... glitter. This will cause any camera flash to reflect back, leaving you looking washed out and pale. Apply highlighter or bronzer with shimmer only in places where you want it (not over your entire face)! I would only apply shimmer on Pamela on her cupid's bow on the top of her lip, her collar bones and on the centre of her lower eyelid. The reasons for this are: - The cupid bow - this will give a fuller pout - Applying to the exposed collar bones connects the body to the face - Centre of the lower part of the eyelid (as opposed to the brow bone) makes the eyes bigger and avoids making them look hooded! I would use MAC Pigment in colour Naked.\n\nIf, however, you have a more rounded face, be careful not to draw 'go faster stripes' on your cheeks to create cheekbones.\n\nOnly contour under your actual bone structure - e.g. on the cheeks and jaw line.\n\nWHEN MORE IS MORE\n\nSo ladies, we all get an invite to a special occasion such as a wedding or a birthday party, or even a date night, and I see so many women who buy new dresses and shoes, then spend all day at the hairdressers and bathe in perfume.\n\nBut then they spend the same amount of time on their make-up as they would on any other day!\n\nAs I said earlier, choose one area and focus on it, so choose if you want to have a statement eye or daring lip.\n\nMy go-to evening product for a daring lip is Hourglass Liquid Matte lipstick in colour Icon.\n\nWhen doing my two-hour theatre show, I can apply this 10 minutes before the show starts and it will still be there 20 songs and countless jokes later.\n\nFor a statement eye I would recommend false eyelashes. Then apply some dark sultry eye shadows or a shimmering kohl eye pencil smudged into the lashes, or even over the lower eyelid up to the crease - it will give your eyes a WOW effect!\n\nRAISE YOUR EYEBROWS\n\nA well-groomed eyebrow is essential, so if that's waxing or threading or plucking it is THE place to start. If you have never done it let the professionals do it for you.\n\nLa Voix also highlighted the importance of using a loose translucent powder to set your make-up. Pictured, stock image\n\nNow we have our groomed eyebrows you need to apply brow powder, pencil and gel in single strokes as if drawing in hairs not in one line left to right - and certainly not meeting in the middle! Go up and down in strokes across the whole brow.\n\nFor a more natural look choose powders or a sheer gel. I would use Suqqu Liquid eyebrow pencil for a day look.\n\nTo create a stronger look or for filling in gaps in ones brow, use a pencil - and you can't go wrong with a Laura Mercier brow pencil.\n\nLA VOIX'S TOP FIVE MAKE-UP HACKS 1. Flawless Base - creates a blank canvas to work from. Think Picasso\u2026 2. Define the lash line with an eyeliner and/or false eyelashes. 3. Lip tip - colour your entire lip with your lip liner and not just the edges, be it bright red or nude. Then apply your lipstick. It will stop the 80s lip line disasters! 4. Use a peach blusher - you'll thank me later! No one wants to look hot and pink. 5. Rock it with confidence and you can wear anything.\n\nGet used to seeing yourself with fuller brows. Brows frame the eyes - you would never hang a picture on the wall without a frame, and the same goes for eyes.\n\nIt is perfectly acceptable and will look fabulous if you go a slight shade darker than your natural hair colour and it will make your eyes pop.\n\nLONGEST LASTING FINISH\n\nGood skin care and a primer are essential. If you have dry skin and you do not use a moisturiser and primer, your skin will absorb your foundation as moisture, meaning it will not last long at all.\n\nA good primer provides a breathable barrier between your skin and the make-up.\n\nIf you have oily skin without an oil free moisturiser and primer, oils in your skin will break up your foundation again, making it not last long and patchy.\n\nSetting your base, be it a light tinted moisturiser or a full coverage foundation, is also important.\n\nUsing a loose translucent powder sparingly with a power puff to apply it sets your make-up, keeping everything in place and looking flawless all night.\n\nPowder, be it loose or in a compact, is not just for our grandmas - powder has moved on so much you will not even know you are wearing it, but your foundation will still be there come party time.
