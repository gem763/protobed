He was struck by participants\u2019 steadfast belief in American values \u201cworth sacrificing everything for.\u201d\n\nBut \u201cbeneath the outward sense of hope and duty, there was an underlying current of frustration, humiliation, anger and fear,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe America that they believed in was under attack, not from without, but from within.\u201d\n\nHe lamented the \u201cassaults on our institutions: on the intelligence and law enforcement community, the State Department and the press.\u201d Those loyal to the nation have \u201cseen our leaders stand beside despots and strongmen ... they have seen us abandon our allies.\u201d He quoted a retired four-star general as telling him: \u201cI don\u2019t like the Democrats, but Trump is destroying the Republic!\u201d\n\nMcRaven asked: \u201cIf we are not the champions of the good and the right, then who will follow us?

He is wrong,\u201d McRaven wrote.\n\n\u201cIf this president doesn\u2019t understand their importance, if this president doesn\u2019t demonstrate the leadership that America needs, both domestically and abroad, then it is time for a new person in the Oval Office \u2014 Republican, Democrat or independent \u2014 the sooner, the better.
