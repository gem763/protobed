Gabbard was \"the favorite of the Russians,\u201d assuming \u201cJill Stein will give it up, which she might not because she's also a Russian asset.\u201d Gabbard responded with harsh tweets calling Clinton the \u201cqueen of warmongers.\u201d\n\nTrump used the appearance to defend Gabbard, Stein and \u2014 most of all \u2014 himself in the primetime interview.\n\n\u201cNow, I don\u2019t know Jill Stein, I know her as an environmentalist, OK, and probably a good woman,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe last thing she is, is a Russian asset. I don\u2019t know Tulsi Gabbard. But I know one thing, she\u2019s not an asset of Russia.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese people are sick,\u201d the president added. \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with them.\u201d\n\nTrump touched on a number of his favorite subjects through the interview, including the idea that that Attorney General William Barr should investigate Clinton, the Biden family were the real corrupt ones in Ukraine, and of course the media is corrupt.\n\nBut soon he circled back to Gabbard and Stein.\n\n\u201cAnd then you have Hillary Clinton saying, two days ago, Tulsi Gabbard is a Russian asset and that Jill Stein is a Russian agent,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Wait a minute, it took me two and a half years. I wish you would have said that earlier because people would have realized she\u2019s crazy. She\u2019s crazy!\u201d\n\nClinton didn\u2019t offer up any real evidence that Russia favored Gabbard in the interview with David Plouffe, the former campaign manager for Barack Obama. She said she thought it seemed like Gabbard was being groomed as a third-party candidate, backed by \u201ca bunch of sites and bots.\u201d\n\nTrump isn\u2019t the only high-profile politician to come to Gabbard\u2019s defense. Senator Bernie Sanders backed his fellow Democratic presidential candidate by citing her military service.\n\n\u201cTulsi Gabbard has put her life on the line to defend this country,\u201d Sanders tweeted. \u201cPeople can disagree on issues, but it is outrageous for anyone to suggest that Tulsi is a foreign asset.\u201d\n\nCover: U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a cabinet meeting in the Cabinet Room of the White House October 21, 2019 in Washington, DC.
