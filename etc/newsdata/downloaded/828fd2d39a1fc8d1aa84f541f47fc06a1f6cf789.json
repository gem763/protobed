He threw four interceptions in the 33-0 loss to the New England Patriots and made the comment while referring to his trouble reading coverages.\n\nSAM DARNOLD'S PERFORMANCE VS. PATRIOTS GETS SPOOKY IN JETS BLOWOUT LOSS: 'I'M SEEING GHOSTS'\n\nDarnold was mic\u2019d up because, according to NFL rules, each team\u2019s starting quarterback and head coach are required to be wired by NFL Films once a season. NFL Films has a representative on-site who will then approve comments to air \u2014 in this case on ESPN\u2019s \u201cMonday Night Football.\u201d\n\nThe approval process is to help prevent players and coaches from saying things that might case themselves, the team or the NFL in a negative light.\n\nESPN declined to comment on the issues and deferred to NFL Films. The NFL had no immediate comment.\n\n\u201cThe NFL screwed Sammy over,\u201d Bell wrote in a tweet. \u201cThere's not one player in the NFL who's cool with having every sideline convo broadcasted to millions...there's a reason we've never heard other QB's frustrated on the sideline like that before...that's crazy, @NFL did Sam dirty as hell.\u201d\n\nOAKLAND RAIDERS LEGEND WILLIE BROWN DEAD AT 78\n\nGase addressed the controversy to the media.\n\n\u201cThat was one of those things that was really disappointing to hear about after the game,\u201d Gase said. \u201cI don't know if I've ever seen that where somebody that was mic'd up, that a comment like that was allowed to be aired. It bothers me. It bothers the organization.\u201d\n\nGase added: \u201cYou're never anticipating something like that happening. The fact that it did just gives us pause to really cooperate anymore because I don't know how we would allow our franchise quarterback to be put out there like that.\u201d\n\nDarnold also addressed the \u201cseeing ghosts\u201d comment during his weekly radio appearance on ESPN New York\u2019s \u201cThe Michael Kay Show.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\n\u201cI'm not embarrassed by it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is what it is. Worse things have happened to me. But at the same time, yeah, it's just a bummer that it was live. It's a lot more common a phrase than it's being made out to be.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "New York Jets running back Le\u2019Veon Bell and coach Adam Gase expressed their frustration Tuesday after Sam Darnold\u2019s \u201cseeing ghosts\u201d comment was caught on a hot mic during a \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d telecast.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
