The complaint was lodged by an intelligence official in August, and alleged that Trump abused his power \"for personal gain\" during a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. It has become the focal point of an impeachment inquiry launched by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi last week.\n\nA person familiar with the matter told The Journal that withdrawing Yovanovitch from her post was a \"priority for the president.\" A White House official told The Journal that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was in favor of the move.\n\nTrump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani told The Journal that he advised the president that there were complaints among his supporters that Yovanovitch privately harbored an \"anti-Trump bias.\"\n\nRead more: 'This was his show': Rudy Giuliani emerges as the key to unraveling the Trump-Ukraine whistleblower scandal\n\nGiuliani added that upon mentioning Yovanovitch to Trump earlier this year, Trump \"remembered he had a problem with her earlier and thought she had been dismissed.\" Giuliani told The Journal that a White House official called him asking him to list concerns about Yovanovitch, which he detailed in a nine-page document to Pompeo.\n\nGiuliani said Pompeo told him that \"they were going to investigate\" the claims made in the letter, and requested additional documents to support allegations.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump told reporters that he couldn't remember if he removed Yovanovitch from her post.\n\n\"I heard very bad things about her,\" he said. \"And I don't know if I recalled her or somebody recalled her, but I heard very, very bad things about her for a long period of time.
