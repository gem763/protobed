Photo: Courtesy of the Warren Campaign\n\nIf you want a good indicator of how well Elizabeth Warren\u2019s presidential campaign has been doing lately, consider the controversy that\u2019s blown up in the past few days over a story she\u2019s been telling for years. It centers on Warren\u2019s claim, part of her account of a hardscrabble early life, that after one year working as a public-school teacher in New Jersey, she was \u201cshown the door\u201d by the school\u2019s principal because she was \u201cvisibly pregnant\u201d with her first child. Critics have noted that school records and an old interview raise doubts about the accuracy of her account.\n\nThe story gained traction on Twitter last week, after Jacobin\u2019s Meagan Day highlighted a 2007 interview Warren gave at the University of California, Berkeley, in which she said she abandoned her career as a public-school teacher after realizing that the required graduate-school classes weren\u2019t \u201cgoing to work out\u201d for her, making no mention of her pregnancy.\n\nOn Monday, the Washington Free Beacon ran with a solemn examination of school-board records from 1971 indicating that Warren was offered a contract to teach for another year, and instead resigned. The story quickly spread through right-wing media circles, with lots of language about Warren being \u201ccaught lying.\u201d\n\nWarren pushed back in an interview with CBS News published late on Monday, highlighting a central problem with the accusation: She does not appear to have said at any point that she was formally \u201cfired:\u201d\n\nWarren told CBS News she stands by her characterization of getting \u201cshown the door\u201d because of her pregnancy and called it an \u201caccurate description.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen someone calls you in and says the job that you\u2019ve been hired for for the next year is no longer yours. \u2018We\u2019re giving it to someone else,\u2019 I think that\u2019s being shown the door,\u201d Warren told CBS News.\n\nAnd Warren maintains the school-board records have nothing to do with the informal dismissal administered by the school principal:\n\nWarren also told CBS News that she was, in fact, officially offered the job for the following year as the school board minutes indicate. \u201cIn April of that year, my contract was renewed to teach again for the next year,\u201d Warren said. She also said she had been hiding her pregnancy from the school.\n\n\u201cI was pregnant, but nobody knew it. And then a couple of months later when I was six months pregnant and it was pretty obvious, the principal called me in, wished me luck, and said he was going to hire someone else for the job,\u201d Warren said.\n\nWarren\u2019s response is satisfying at a factual level. But there\u2019s a bigger point here that\u2019s worth highlighting: An essential element of informal discrimination \u2014 of the sort Warren seems to have faced \u2014 is to expect the victim to take the crucial step to avoid unpleasant confrontations. It\u2019s not unlike the strategy of encouraging undocumented immigrants to \u201cself-deport.\u201d\n\nAnd CBS actually turned up evidence that, in 1971, Warren was facing precisely the kind of culture of discrimination that made the story of her dismissal an appropriate point to hit in her stump speech:\n\nTwo retired teachers who worked at Riverdale Elementary for over 30 years, including the year Warren was there, told CBS News that they don\u2019t remember anyone being explicitly fired due to pregnancy during their time at the school. But Trudy Randall and Sharon Ercalano each said that a non-tenured, pregnant employee like Warren would have had little job security at Riverdale in 1971, seven years before the Pregnancy Discrimination Act was passed.\n\n\u201cThe rule was at five months you had to leave when you were pregnant. Now, if you didn\u2019t tell anybody you were pregnant, and they didn\u2019t know, you could fudge it and try to stay on a little bit longer,\u201d Randall said. \u201cBut they kind of wanted you out if you were pregnant.\u201d\n\nAs the school board minutes show, no member of the Riverdale school board at the time was a woman. A full year after Warren\u2019s dismissal, the Associated Press wrote that a recent New Jersey State Division of Civil Rights decision meant that \u201cpregnant teachers can no longer be automatically forced out of New Jersey classrooms.\u201d\n\nThe story will probably fade, though on the margins you might see the right trying to link it to the \u201cPocahontas\u201d narrative (based on Warren\u2019s self-identification as a Native American in an academic directory a long time ago, and her mishandling of the issue just before her presidential campaign began). And for conservatives and swing voters bothered by the Native American business, a story suggesting that Warren embellished a tale of workplace discrimination could serve as another example of her playing identity politics without merit. For progressives with doubts about Warren, it could stir a sense that she is a Harvard elitist (and former Republican!) donning the clothes of teachers and other working mothers, while also borrowing Bernie\u2019s populist thunder. But, again, this would only be at the margins. At any top-line level, this story is nothing for the Warren campaign to worry about.\n\nThere\u2019s even potential it could have an upside for her: Don\u2019t be surprised if Warren gets some sympathy from women \u2014 including Republicans and independents \u2014 who have similarly been expected to self-defenestrate at work and then keep their mouths shut.", "description": "Elizabeth Warren has  given strong answers to questions about her story about being pushed out of a teaching job for being pregnant.
