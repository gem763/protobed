His failed lawsuit has now put the paper in financial peril.", "language": "en", "text": "AD\n\nAnd then he filed a libel lawsuit immediately.\n\nNow, even though the newspaper handily won the case, the legal expenses have left the family-owned local newspaper in financial peril, leading Burns to create a GoFundMe fundraiser seeking $140,000 to cover the expenses and to try to keep the paper in the family.\n\nAD\n\nSuch have been the consequences of high-impact journalism for a newspaper with limited resources in rural America, already confronted with the financial challenges of a rapidly evolving digital-media landscape. Mix in a costly libel lawsuit and the Times Herald\u2019s future could be in trouble. In an interview Wednesday, Burns said the $140,000 represents expenses not covered by libel insurance as well as lost advertising revenue and subscribers, who doubted the paper\u2019s reporting on Smith. An Iowa judge ruled the articles were accurate in dismissing Smith\u2019s libel lawsuit in May 2018.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cStanding up to the patriarchy, particularly in a rural reach of the nation, and especially now, is a financially perilous choice, one fraught with pressures from a host of sources and power centers, many of whom sought to kill the story and then retaliated against the newspaper,\u201d Burns wrote in the GoFundMe page, which has so far raised roughly $6,800 as of early Thursday. \u201cWe published the stories, and would again, but the legal bills and other expenses and losses, even after our libel insurance, jeopardize the local ownership of the newspaper.\u201d\n\nThe Carroll Times Herald has been in Burns\u2019s family for the better part of a century.\n\nAD\n\nHis grandfather, James W. Wilson, worked in the east Iowa coal mines to save up money to go to journalism school at the University of Missouri, Burns said, before returning to Iowa to find work. Wilson began as the then-Carroll Herald\u2019s business manager in 1929 and took over ownership in 1944. Three generations later, here\u2019s Burns, sitting in the same office as his grandfather.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is my life. I\u2019ve dedicated everything I have to the paper,\u201d Burns, who is also a reporter, told The Washington Post. \u201cSo there\u2019s a lot at stake when you\u2019re facing something like this\u201d\n\nBetween July 2017 and May 2018, the newspaper published a series of stories related to Smith\u2019s relationships with teenagers and the ensuing litigation. Smith sued for libel the day after the paper published the first article, \u201cCarroll cop who courted teenage girls resigns.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe newspaper\u2019s investigation found that Smith had been hired at the Carroll Police Department in 2015, not long after being fired from the Sumner Police Department in northeastern Iowa, in part for inappropriate Facebook messages to a 16-year-old girl. As a cop in Carroll \u2014 a town of fewer than 10,000, whose cozy downtown is surrounded by miles of farmland \u2014 Smith met a 17-year-old girl while investigating a potential car burglary that she called 911 to report, the Times Herald reported.\n\nAD\n\nImmediately thereafter, they began exchanging dozens of \u201cflirtatious\u201d text messages, the paper reported. And soon, the high school senior moved in with Smith, then 25, in his Carroll home after a fight with her parents, having a sexual relationship with him while Smith\u2019s wife was away taking care of her mother who had cancer, according to the investigation. (The age of consent in Iowa is 16 and Smith is not accused of any crimes.) Smith then began a relationship with a 19-year-old woman in town, the Times Herald reported, leading the 17-year-old to vandalizing the other woman\u2019s car.\n\nBurns said the reaction to the investigation was a \u201cmixed bag,\u201d with some parents of teenagers praising the newspaper\u2019s work to rid local law enforcement of an officer who had sexual relationships with young girls. Others greeted the investigation with an \u201cunexpected level of hostility,\u201d Burns said, siding with law enforcement and doubting the reporting. \"Fake news\u201d rhetoric, he said, has trickled down to affect even local papers.\n\nAD\n\nIn his libel lawsuit, Smith disputed the investigation\u2019s findings, saying, his \u201creputation has been destroyed, his character and integrity forever castigated in the public eye, and his employability as a law officer severely damaged if not totally ruined.\"\n\nAD\n\nBut during his deposition, Smith admitted having sex with the 17-year-old, saying he knew it was wrong.\n\nFor Burns, listening to Smith\u2019s admissions felt \u201csurreal.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was head-spinning for me, to listen to a former police officer admit that he had a sexual relationship with a teenager and acknowledge that it was wrong \u2014 and I\u2019m sitting there in the role of the defendant who\u2019s having to bankroll all the defense,\u201d Burns said.\n\nBurns said the paper refused to settle, standing by its reporting and confident it stood on solid ground. They were vindicated in May 2018 when an Iowa district court judge agreed.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe article at issue is accurate and true, and the underlying facts undisputed,\u201d District Judge Thomas Bice wrote in a 10-page ruling dismissing the case.'\n\nAD\n\nIowa does not have an anti-SLAPP law on the books, which discourages meritless libel or slander lawsuits oftentimes by making those who file suit pay attorney\u2019s fees if they lose the case. The legal victory was welcome, Burns said, but more than a year later, the paper has still not caught up financially.\n\nIn April, the paper switched to a twice-a-week publishing schedule rather than five, but with more online news. In its heyday, it published every day.\n\nLast year, a study by the University of North Carolina Hussman School of Journalism and Media found that more than 1,300 American communities completely lost their local news source, creating \u201cnews deserts,\u201d and that 20 percent of all metro or community newspapers went out of business or merged since 2004.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBurns said he feels the Times Herald is far from approaching its end, but he created the GoFundMe because he felt he had to do everything he could to keep it healthy, so it could continue robust reporting.\n\n\u201cSmall newspapers like ours, we\u2019re kind of the last vestige for collective or common truth, or trust,\u201d Burns said. \u201cPretty much everything in our paper you\u2019re one or two degrees of separation away from personally, so you know it to be true because you were there \u2014 you were at the game, or you see an obituary and it\u2019s somebody you were connected to. \u2026 We own the paper, but in a very real sense, I\u2019ve always looked at it like I\u2019m a temporary steward of the paper. At the end of the day, it really belongs to the community.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The co-owner has now started a GoFundMe to help recoup legal expenses that have burned a hole in the family-owned newspaper's budget.", "authors": ["Meagan Flynn", "Morning Mix Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/w3w3JcEwuZx3VMSLtKCodD3yJlY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4WQCNL5L5JFWLJWZ5UMSWC6NM4.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
