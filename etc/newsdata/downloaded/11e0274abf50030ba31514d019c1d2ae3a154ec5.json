Autos and Agriculture are the sticking points.\n\nJapan Trade Deal Hopes Fade\n\nIt's not just China. No one should be surprised that Hopes of a Trade Deal With Japan Have Faded.\n\n\u201cIt will be a very tough negotiation,\u201d said one of the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. \u201cIf there is to be an \u2018agreement\u2019 we need to have something we can formally announce, which is tough,\u201d said another Japanese official, adding that it will be difficult to agree on a deal in September unless Washington makes more concessions.\n\nFour Hangups\n\nWashington is targeting Japan\u2019s auto exports, which account for about two-thirds of the U.S. trade deficit with Japan at roughly 7 trillion yen ($65.82 billion) a year. Trump wants to open up Japan\u2019s market for agriculture goods and beef. One demand Washington is making is for Tokyo to cut tariffs on U.S. beef and pork imports. Japan wants the United States to cut tariffs on imports of car parts and industrial goods - something Washington is reluctant to. U.S. automakers are also want to include a provision prohibiting both countries from engaging in currency manipulation. Japanese officials are opposed to adding such language in the deal, for fear of having their hands tied in battling any unwelcome yen spike that hurts the country\u2019s exports.\n\nAnything Else?\n\nJust an observation that Trump does not trust Japan and Japan does not trust Trump.\n\nQuestion of Trust\n\nThere is no reason for any country to trust Trump.\n\nTo be fair, there is no particular reason for Trump to trust either Japan or China.\n\nBig Picture\n\nIt's important to stand back and look at the big picture.\n\nIf indeed Japan and China are subsidizing exports, that is to the benefit of US consumers.\n\nWe should welcome subsidies.\n\nRemember TPP\n\nPlease recall that Trump cancelled TPP, the Trans-Pacific Trade Partnership, a trade agreement with Australia, Canada, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, the United States, and Vietnam, now minus the US.\n\nIn that deal, Japan significantly lowered tariffs on agriculture for the TPP participants.\n\nAustralia and Canada were the primary beneficiaries.\n\nIt will now take huge tariff cuts by Japan just for the US to break even with where we could have been relative to Australia and Canada.\n\nIn return, Japan wants a further reduction in US auto tariffs.\n\nTrump in a Box\n\nTrump put himself in a box.\n\nHe has no winnable solution other than backing down.\n\nBut that is contradictory to his ridiculous message \"Trade wars are good and easy to win.\"", "description": "Hopes for a trade deal between the US and Japan .09/02/2019 3:21:54AM EST.", "authors": ["Mike Shedlock", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/269/0449ced3-ee57-47d7-ade7-8e3a31dd8f59.jpg"}
