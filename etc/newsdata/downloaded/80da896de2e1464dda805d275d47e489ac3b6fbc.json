From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nHow tonight will work The eight Hundred franchises have been assigned positions in a snaking 14-round draft, with Trent Rockets having the first pick, Birmingham Phoenix the eighth and ninth, the Rockets 16 and 17, and so on and so forth until each team has 14 players, plus the on centrally contracted England Test player. The eight teams already have two other players each, selected from their pool of local stars at the counties affiliated to each side, and a draft slot sacrificed for each. We'll run you through who each side picked up in a moment, but essentially it means that as the first four franchises in the order all opted to use a fourth-round equivalent contract on a local player, only the Phoenix, London Spirit, Manchester Originals and Oval Invincibles will pick in that round. It is all rather complex, and there is still ANOTHER stage of recruitment after next summer's T20 Blast, but we should get the hang of things as we move along after the start of the draft in an hour-or-so. Right - to the teams. Rejoice, The Hundred is here! Or the draft is, at least. Yes after plenty of light-hearted lampooning, patchy PR, serious criticism and just enough of a smidge of optimism to believe this grand new competition could just be a success, finally something resembling an actual cricketing competition is looming into view. Tonight, the eight new franchises will each pick 12 new members, all but completing their rosters ahead of next summer's inaugural 100-ball extravaganza. I'll be with you throughout the night's festivities, so let's get to it... What is \u2018The Hundred\u2019? It\u2019s a new competition, in which eight teams from seven UK cities will face off against each other. Each team will have a men\u2019s side and a women\u2019s side, consisting of 15 players each. Matches will see each team bat for 100 balls, with the side securing the most runs emerging victorious. The 100 balls can be bowled in sets of five or 10, and bowlers can switch ends halfway through a 10-ball spell if they wish. No bowler can deliver more than 20 balls, and each team is allowed a 150-second tactical timeout while fielding...
