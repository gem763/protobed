USA TODAY\n\nLANDOVER, Md. \u2014 It was rainy. And sloppy. And ugly.\n\nBut for the San Francisco 49ers, all that matters is that it was another win.\n\nThe 49ers remained undefeated Sunday with a 9-0 win over the lowly Washington Redskins, moving to 6-0 for just the third time since 1950 and the first since 1990. San Francisco is still the only undefeated team in the NFC and one of just two unbeatens remaining in the league through six-plus weeks.\n\nThe Redskins fell to 1-6.\n\nHere are three takeaways from Sunday's game:\n\n1. Second-half resurgence: The 49ers only had 5 passing yards in the first half and 68 yards of offense overall in that span. But they've been a second-half team all season, and they lived up to that reputation again Sunday.\n\nThough a Jimmy Garoppolo interception stalled one drive, and the 49ers never did make it into the end zone, they were able to move the ball relatively effectively, especially given the steady rain that fell throughout the game. Garoppolo wasn't great by any means, but he made a few nice plays with his legs and completed a few huge passes down the stretch, including a throw to George Kittle over the middle in the third quarter to prolong a scoring drive.\n\n2. Gould questions linger. This 49ers team, when healthy, doesn't have many flaws. But in the past few weeks, it's become fair to wonder about Robbie Gould, who is the highest-paid kicker in the league but entered Sunday's game having missed four of his past seven kicks.\n\nGould shanked another one in this game, a 45-yarder in the first quarter that sailed wide left. Perhaps the weather played a role. But Gould also rebounded by converting three field goals inside 30 yards, which proved to be the only points in the game. Though questions about Gould aren't going away anytime soon, it was nevertheless a positive development for the 49ers and their beleaguered kicker.\n\n3. Run-heavy Redskins: When he took the reins from Jay Gruden a few weeks ago, interim coach Bill Callahan made it clear that the Redskins, under his watch, were going to run the ball more regularly. It worked last week against Miami, and it seemed like the right strategy early Sunday, given the weather. But there were multiple points in this game where the Redskins became a bit too predictable with their run-first mantra.\n\nOn one play in the fourth quarter, in particular, the Redskins ran a jet sweep on a third-and-8, when down by six points and near midfield. They gained 2 yards and punted. There's nothing wrong with running the ball, especially when the weather is crummy. But if Washington wants to win another game or two this season, it will need to have a bit more trust in Case Keenum (or, eventually, Dwayne Haskins) than that.\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on Twitter @Tom_Schad.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
