While racing to the finish line, they must navigate to a series of check-points en route. In the women\u2019s middle distance competition at the Games, Chinese orienteers had come close to sweeping the winners podium, with competitors in first, second, and fourth place. (A male Chinese orienteer placed second in the men\u2019s race.) But an investigation into their conduct was kicked off after complaints from six other countries participating \u2014 Russia, Switzerland, France, Belgium, Poland and Austria.\n\nAfter investigating the complaints, a jury decided to disqualify the competitors and void the results of their race from final tallies. In a statement, the International Orienteering Federation (IOF) decried that, \u201cthe middle fistance competition was unfortunately overshadowed by extensive cheating by the Chinese team.\u201d Detailing the investigation, the statement explained that \u201cit was soon discovered and proven that the runners had received illegal assistance both by spectators in the terrain, markings and small paths prepared for them and which only they were aware of.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t want to lose,\u201d 20-year-old Li Meizhen, a member of China\u2019s orienteering team, had said in a pre-competition profile on the Games\u2019 website. \u201cOrienteering is like life. You may feel fatigue and encounter obstacles. Yet you can always find surprises and joy,\u201d she added.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

The team appealed the jury\u2019s decision with the International Military Sports Council (CISM), but their appeal was denied. Though the IOF\u2019s statement noted that \u201cthe [revised] results are not yet official,\u201d results currently listed on the Military World Games website do not list any Chinese participants as winning medals in the middle distance races (or in subsequent orienteering competitions).\n\nNow the IOF, which governs the rules of the sport, is partnering with CISM to deliver sanctions to those involved. IOF will also be investigating Chinese teams participating in the Orienteering World Cup finals (a civilian event) that began Friday, also being hosted by China.\n\n\u201cThe IOF takes the actions of the Chinese team very seriously and is pleased to see that the IOF rules regarding the fairness of competition were enforced by the jury and CISM and that the best solution was found for those athletes who compete within the regulations of the sport,\u201d said IOF Secretary General Tom Hollowell in a public statement.\n\nThe Military World Games kicked off in China on Oct. 18 with a ceremony and declaration from Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nThe Games are \u201ca multisports event organized every four years\u2026 based on the CISM and Olympic spirit, without political, religious and racial consideration nor discrimination,\u201d the CISM\u2019s website explains. \u201cBy organizing [the] Games, CISM has launched the most explicit and spectacular message of peace to the whole world\u2026 Those who had seemed to be forever divided by ideological and political barriers came together under the CISM flag in the name of friendship.\u201d\n\nAcross the 2019 Games as a whole, as of Friday China is in first place on the medal table, with 193 medals total as of Friday evening. Russia and Brazil, with 136 and 74 medals respectively, are in 2nd and 3rd place. The Games conclude on Oct. 27.\n\nWrite to Jasmine Aguilera at jasmine.aguilera@time.com.", "description": "A Chinese orienteering team was disqualified for cheating in the 2019 Military World Games, which were hosted this year in Wuhan, China", "authors": ["Jasmine Aguilera"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/chinese-team-orienteering-cheating.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
