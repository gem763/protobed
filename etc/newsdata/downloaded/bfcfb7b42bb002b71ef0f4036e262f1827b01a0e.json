The pain becomes worse and worse. It makes even walking painful. Afterwards I get so itchy.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s difficult because you feel aroused and you want to do something about it, but when you do the pain is so intense.\u2019\n\nNatalie has to put ice on her genitals during painful episodes of pelvic pain (Picture: Natalie Bricker /SWNS)\n\nNatalie can\u2019t masturbate either as it results in sharp stabbing pains around her clitoris. At times, she\u2019s also had to resort to holding an ice bag on her privates.\n\nHer main concern though is her relationship with her husband Robert.\n\n\u2018My relationship with my husband has been difficult and I have a lot of insecurities,\u2019 she explained.\n\n\u2018Because we don\u2019t have intercourse often I do have insecurities about whether or not he would cheat on me.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s a good man, he married me knowing the issues I have and the barriers that it creates for sex.\u2019\n\nThe couple normally has sex once or twice annually but Natalie has to have a few drinks before going through with it.\n\nShe said: \u2018It hurts, it feels like I\u2019ve been hit by a truck.\u2019\n\nNatalie experiences arousal at least once a day (Picture: Natalie Bricker /SWNS)\n\nNatalie believes her condition stems from a car accident in 2002, during which she believes she injured her pudendal nerve, which is responsible for carrying messages from the external genitalia.\n\nAlthough she appeared uninjured, Natalie experienced recurrent thrush and sex with Robert began to cause pain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNatalie suffered with the condition\u2019s symptoms for more than a decade before she was officially diagnosed with pudendal neuralgia in 2014.\n\nA few years later, she was forced to give up her job as a care assistant.\n\n\u2018I was so fatigued and I would have intense pain every time I had a bowel movement.\n\n\u2018I was taking a strong painkiller at work to deal with it and if I had to go, the pain and the anxiety would set in. I began to have panic attacks.\u2019\n\nSince her diagnosis, Natalie has undergone several treatments to help relieve her pain as well as seeing a pelvic floor specialis\n\nNow, the condition has gotten somewhat better as she can go for a daily walk and run errands.\n\nShe now dreams of having a family but says her chronic condition has made their path to parenthood more difficult.\n\nIf it doesn\u2019t work, they may consider fostering or adopting. To help them deal with their life together as well as how to become parents, the couple is also in counseling.\n\nRobert added: \u2018I married Natalie when I knew we would have these issues because I am an eternal optimist.\n\n\u2018I love her so much and I didn\u2019t want to give up the opportunity to be with her forever.\n\n\u2018I have hope that we\u2019re always one doctor away.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Woman with endometriosis is mistaken for being pregnant thanks to severe bloating\n\nMORE: Woman who hasn\u2019t had sex due to painful vaginismus gives birth naturally\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Natalie Bricker was diagnosed with Persistent Genital Arousal Disorder, a condition that causes severe pelvic pain every time she is aroused.", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/painful-sex_1571040979.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
