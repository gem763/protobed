But the populists seem unable to secure a majority for their radical, anti-European course almost anywhere.\n\nThe most obvious case is Italy. Former Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, whose far-right League Party was sharing power uneasily with the anti-establishment 5Star Movement (M5S) in Western Europe\u2019s first populist government, thought the country was ripe for a hard-right turn and pulled the plug on the coalition in mid-August, demanding an early election.\n\nWhile \u201cIl Capitano\u201d toured the beaches, taking bare-chested selfies with supporters and breathing fire at Rome, his attempt to consolidate power collapsed. His erstwhile coalition partners held their noses and agreed to form a government with the mainstream, center-left Democratic Party instead. Italy has pulled back from the brink, at least for now, and is set to revert to more moderate, EU-friendly economic and migration policies.\n\nIn Spain too, populists of the far left and extreme right appear to be losing ground.\n\nSalvini\u2019s failure has dented his party in opinion polls and raised first doubts about his leadership. But Italy\u2019s wheel of fortune spins fast. The would-be strongman and master of social media may be back soon if the economy continues to flatline and the new coalition falters.\n\nExhibit B is Britain. Boris Johnson\u2019s attempt to out-populist the populists by vowing to lead the U.K. out of the European Union \u2014 \u201cdo or die\u201d \u2014 on October 31, even if that means crashing out without a deal, suffered a spectacular defeat in parliament on Tuesday.\n\nThe new prime minister, who had promised to \u201ctake back control\u201d from Europe as leader of the Leave campaign in the 2016 referendum, lost control of Brexit in his first House of Commons vote, at least for now.\n\nGiven the chaotic state of U.K. politics, public fatigue at endless battles over Brexit and the unattractive hard-left alternative offered by the Labour Party\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn, Johnson may yet manage to purge and reposition the Conservative Party as the true Brexit party and win a general election next month. But that looks less likely after his big gamble on suspending parliament to push through a no-deal Brexit has faltered.\n\nMeanwhile Nigel Farage, whose Brexit Party crushed the Conservatives and beat Labour in the European Parliament election in May, may once again face the frustration of setting the Conservatives\u2019 agenda but failing to achieve a breakthrough in the U.K. parliament.\n\nExhibit C is France, where President Emmanuel Macron looked to be in deep trouble six months ago with the grassroots anti-establishment Gilets Jaunes (Yellow Jackets) staging often violent demonstrations every Saturday and Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally surging in the polls.\n\nNow Macron is back in the saddle, most of the Yellow Jackets have gone home, at least for now, and Le Pen fell short of a game-changing victory in the European election. With unemployment falling and the economy holding up, populism seems to have hit its glass ceiling in France.\n\nAustria\u2019s coalition between conservatives and the far-right Freedom Party (FP\u00d6) crashed and burned in May when the anti-immigrant movement\u2019s leader was exposed on video offering contracts to a purported Russian businesswoman in exchange for illicit funding. Ejected from government, the FP\u00d6 is still polling at around 20 percent but looks unlikely to return to power after this month\u2019s snap general election.\n\nIn Spain too, populists of the far left and extreme right appear to be losing ground as Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez\u2019s Socialist minority government gains in popularity.\n\nIn Germany, the AfD\u2019s surge in the states of Brandenburg and Saxony left them still in opposition; all the mainstream parties seem determined to shut them out of power locally and nationally.\n\nTo be sure, ruling right-wing nationalist parties scored spectacular victories in the European Parliament election in Poland and Hungary and continue to defy EU censure over the rule of law and civil rights. But Poland\u2019s de facto leader, Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, may lose his absolute parliamentary majority in an October general election despite his popular combination of welfarism and Catholic nationalist social conservatism.\n\nMeanwhile, fears of an illiberal populist wave sweeping the whole of Central Europe have proven overblown, with a liberal democrat winning the Slovakian presidential election and billionaire Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babi\u0161 facing mass protests over his alleged conflicts of interest.\n\nStill, mainstream politicians would be wrong to see the ebbing of the populist tide as a reason to relax. The underlying drivers of nationalist politics are still there.\n\nThe erosion of some of the foundations of 20th century European democracy \u2014 political parties, trade unions, religious communities and industrial jobs for life \u2014 has left societies more volatile. Growing income inequality, concerns about migration and the disruption of low-skilled jobs by globalization provide a continuing seed bed for the politics of nativist anger in Europe and in the United States.\n\nAnd social media offers an instant outlet for all forms of protest, amplified by fake news and other manipulation.\n\nThere\u2019s also the fact that populists don\u2019t need to be in power to set the agenda \u2014 especially on hot-button issues like immigration, where they have successfully shifted the discussion from how best to welcome refugees and integrate economic migrants to how to buttress \u201cfortress Europe\u201d and make it harder to enter the Continent \u2014 no matter how valid your claims to asylum.\n\nThe tide may have broken, but there\u2019s still plenty of mopping up to be done.\n\nPaul Taylor, contributing editor at POLITICO, writes the Europe At Large column.", "description": "Tide may have turned against nationalist right.", "authors": ["Paul Taylor", "Jacopo Barigazzi", "Silvia Sciorilli Borrelli", "Rym Momtaz"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SalviniW109xH84-1200x628.jpg"}
