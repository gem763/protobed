Further, they allege, the details of that story suggest Biden did the same thing Trump is accused of doing -- leveraging military aid to pressure Ukraine.\n\nGIULIANI ACCUSES UKRAINE OF LAUNDERING $3M TO HUNTER BIDEN, ASKS HOW OBAMA COULD LET THAT HAPPEN\n\n\u201cThe more they want to talk about Ukraine, the better,\u201d Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani said Monday morning on Fox Business Network\u2019s \u201cMornings with Maria.\u201d\n\nGiuliani has long been looking into the Bidens\u2019 ties to Ukraine, claiming Hunter Biden improperly benefited from business dealings in Ukraine with energy company Burisma Holdings as a member of its board and questioning whether his dad helped protect him.\n\nHunter Biden was hired by Burisma in April 2014, two months after Ukraine's Russia-friendly president was ousted by protesters and as his father was heavily involved in U.S. efforts to support the new pro-Western government and its pledge to fight corruption. The hiring of the younger Biden immediately raised concerns that the Ukrainian firm, whose owner was a political ally of the ousted president, was seeking to gain influence with the Obama administration.\n\nTwo years later, then-Vice President Joe Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine unless a top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, was fired. Shokin was accused by many in Ukraine and in the West of being soft on corruption, but he also had been leading an investigation into Burisma's owner.\n\nTrump has claimed Shokin \"was after\" Hunter Biden and the vice president was trying to protect his son.\n\n\u201cThe very thing they\u2019re accusing President Trump of doing, Biden did,\u201d Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., told \u201cFox & Friends\u201d Monday.\n\nFox News reported on the Biden controversy in April. The New York Times published a lengthy story on the matter in May. But the controversy flew largely under the radar until now. While the heat is on Trump over whether or not he pressured Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, that firestorm has prompted multiple news outlets to revisit the original Biden controversy in order to provide context.\n\nTrump allies are hammering that as the real scandal, as video of Biden once bragging about his role in having Shokin fired has gone viral.\n\nBIDEN'S CAMPAIGN LIKELY COMING TO AN END, NUNES SAYS\n\nBiden has denied wrongdoing, with Shokin having already been suspected of corruption before his dismissal, and hammered Trump over the reports on his phone conversation with Kiev. For his part, Trump addressed his phone call with Zelensky by calling the conversation \u201cperfect\u201d and insisting \u201cthere was no quid pro quo\u201d and that he \u201csaid absolutely nothing wrong.\u201d Trump also insists that the idea of withholding military aid from Ukraine is bogus because he gave the aid.\n\nTrump also tweeted Sunday night, stating that the Ukrainian government backed him up by saying he did not pressure them during the phone call. In the same tweet, he said the \u201creal story\u201d was Biden pressuring Ukraine into firing Shokin.\n\nGiuliani is also trying to circulate new Biden allegations.\n\nGiuliani accused Kiev on Monday of laundering $3 million to Hunter Biden and suggested the Obama administration turned a blind eye.\n\n\"If Dem party doesn\u2019t call for an investigation of Bidens\u2019 millions from Ukraine and billions from China, they will own it,\u201d he tweeted. \"Bidens\u2019 made big money selling public office. How could Obama have allowed this to happen? Will Dems continue to condone and enable this kind pay-for-play?\"\n\nWhile the former vice president has claimed he and his son never discussed Hunter\u2019s business, Hunter told The New Yorker that they did talk about it once, with Joe Biden telling his son, \"I hope you know what you are doing.\"\n\nDemocrats and Republicans are both pushing for investigations. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who has shied away from calling for impeachment in the past, told CNN on Sunday that the latest allegations against Trump may warrant such a measure.\n\n\u201cIf the president is essentially withholding military aid at the same time that he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit \u2026 then that may be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that that conduct represents,\u201d Schiff said.\n\nDemocratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has resisted calls for impeachment for other alleged Trump transgressions, said Sunday that unless acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire provides information about a whistleblower complaint involving Trump to Congress, administration officials \"will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness, which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation.\"\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., meanwhile, told Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures\u201d that he wants the Justice Department to look into the Bidens\u2019 dealings with Ukraine.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s looked at this, but somebody should, so I\u2019m hoping the Department of Justice will look at the Biden-Ukraine connection like we looked at the Trump-Russia connection,\u201d Graham said. \u201cWas there a relationship between the vice president\u2019s family and the Ukraine business world that was inappropriate? I don\u2019t know. Somebody other than me needs to look at it, and I sure as hell don\u2019t trust the media to get to the bottom of it.\u201d\n\nAll this comes as Democrats continue to battle for the 2020 presidential nomination. After three debates, Biden remains the front-runner, but he has lost ground to rivals Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., with Warren surpassing Biden in a new Iowa poll.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "President Trump\u2019s allies are leaning\u00a0into the controversy over a phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky,\u00a0gambling that the increased attention to the story could actually hurt the president\u2019s potential 2020 rival\u00a0Joe Biden.", "authors": ["Ronn Blitzer"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/07/Trump-Biden-AP.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
