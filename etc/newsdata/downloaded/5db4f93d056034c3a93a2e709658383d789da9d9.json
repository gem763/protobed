Last week I posted a response to his Tweet thread about the Bulwark. And while I still stand by everything that I wrote substantively, I misunderstood what Sean was actually responding to. The Atlantic\u2019s McKay Coppins wrote a piece about the Bulwark and I only read some snippets someone sent me. I didn\u2019t realize the real thrust of the article \u2014 and what Sean was responding to \u2014 was the Bulwark\u2019s purported policy of going after \u201cTrump-friendly politicos by name \u2014 often in witheringly personal terms.\u201d\n\nWhy didn\u2019t I read the whole Coppins article or Sean\u2019s tweet thread a bit more closely? Because I made a mistake on a very busy day. My apologies.\n\nAnyway, I discovered the scope of the mistake when I read this piece by Melissa Mackenzie:\n\nHere\u2019s the question another way: Why does opposing Trump mean that one must be nasty to Trump\u2019s more respected and erudite defenders? What purpose is there, for example, in trying to destroy Victor Davis Hansen? When Trump gets out of office (and it will happen, if not by the glorious swan dive of impeachment or by rotting away his dotage in prison as the Never Trump wing hope), how will attempting to destroy someone personally influence the post-Trump party? What place will the most vociferous anti-Trumpers have once they\u2019ve alienated everyone with whom they disagree? That\u2019s what Trende is getting at. Jonah doesn\u2019t answer that question.\n\nShe\u2019s right \u2014 because I didn\u2019t realize that was the question. I like the Bulwark and many of the people who work there (I also like Melissa). But I\u2019m perfectly comfortable saying that I don\u2019t see eye-to-eye with them about this editorial policy, even if I often agree with many of the criticisms that they\u2019ve leveled against Trump boosters so far (I\u2019m also not convinced that this is actually the editorial policy of the Bulwark). And it should be fairly apparent that I don\u2019t follow the same editorial approach (indeed, my initial post in response to Sean made it clear I was talking about policy differences). Sure, I\u2019ve disagreed with my colleagues at times, and they with me, about Trump and a host of other matters, (just search for my writings about nationalism of late). But I\u2019ve always tried to do it respectfully.\n\nBut since we\u2019re clearing the air, I find much of Melissa\u2019s larger argument to be very unpersuasive and more than a little thin-skinned at times. She assigns views and attitudes to me I don\u2019t hold or share and that are not reflected in my writing. It\u2019s a lot of guilt by association.\n\nShe also writes:\n\nBack to the strategy question Sean asked. How does demonizing one\u2019s ostensible allies help? How likely are those who\u2019ve been sprayed with venom for four (or eight!) years to want to work with self-described vanguards of True Conservatism\u2122?\n\nI find this rich. In the piece itself, Melissa runs through many of the usual tropes that Trump boosters use to demonize people that they call \u201cNever Trumpers\u201d (never mind that this is not a label I use for myself). Moreover, the American Spectator, and similar outlets, do this kind of venom spraying all of the time. Why isn\u2019t that a bad idea, too? What I think many pro-Trump folks don\u2019t realize is that the Trump critics are often just returning fire.\n\nAnd, just to cut to the chase, Trump Apologists Against Demonization is pretty much a null set. If your policy is to say that personal attacks from the Bulwark are bad but personal attacks from Trump\u2019s biggest boosters \u2014 and Trump himself \u2014 are fine, or even great (or simply not worth condemning because it\u2019s more important to be a team player) then you\u2019re not really against venom-spraying, you just think it\u2019s unfair when anyone other than Trump & Co. are \u201ccounter-punchers\u201d or you care more about political maneuvering than truth-telling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso \u201creturns fire\u201d or \u201ccounter-punching\u201d really aren\u2019t the right phrases, because what often passes for \u201cpersonal attacks\u201d or \u201cdemonization\u201d is just pointing out what people said and wrote in the past and how hard it is to reconcile that stuff with what they\u2019re saying in the present to defend Trump\u2019s behavior, policies, rhetoric, etc. And, for Trump himself, simply taking him seriously or literally can qualify as an unfair attack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, so-called Never Trumpers \u2014 again, not my label \u2014 can never win. They\u2019re irrelevant, meaningless, specks being swept into the dust bin of history by the great MAGA tide and they\u2019re to blame for Trump\u2019s problems. Their views don\u2019t matter and Oh my God why are they so mean!? They\u2019re servants of the Deep State or the Establishment using their power to constrain Trump and they\u2019re powerless hacks with no constituency.\n\nI wish the Trumpists would pick a lane.\n\nSomething to Consider If you enjoyed this article, we have a proposition for you: Join NRPLUS.
