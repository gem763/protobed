The so-called Rampage missile is a precision-guided air-launched stand-off missile with a range of about 90 miles (145 kilometers). With a length of 4.7 meters, the Rampage weighs 570 kilograms. According to press reports, it will carry a warhead of around 150 kilograms.\n\n\u201cThe Rampage features optimal penetration capability into protected areas,\u201d the companies said in the press release. \u201cThe targets that best fit the capabilities of the new rocket include communication and command centers, air forces bases, maintenance centers, infrastructures and valuable field targets protected by anti-air systems.\u201d Its ability to penetrate difficult targets appears to come from a combination of different characteristics. As IHS Jane\u2019s explains, these include the missile\u2019s speed as well as its ability to be programmed to fly at different trajectories that confuse air defense systems, especially if the defense systems have to grapple with numerous different missiles.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Iran has taken notice.", "authors": ["Zachary Keck"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Ww6rkNs7.XgjSTU6cUlYgg--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/307593933cb55cd566c45e44970be6d1", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
