Meanwhile, a group including McGrory, Baldwin, Lord Mandelson and others have been fighting to keep the organisation focused on winning the argument for a second EU referendum.\n\nRudd is expected to move next to remove Mandelson, his former friend of 30 years, from the board of Open Britain. Mandelson has tried to resist Rudd\u2019s growing control over the organisation and efforts to change the senior staff.\n\nDuring a telephone meeting of directors on 9 October, Rudd received support from six other directors to get rid of four People\u2019s Vote directors \u2013 Mandelson, McGrory, Will Straw and Joe Carberry. They are due to be removed as directors next week.\n\nMandelson told the Guardian: \u201cRoland Rudd is like the captain of the Titanic demanding the passengers show him more respect as the iceberg carves open the hull and water gushes into the bowels of the ship.\u201d\n\nTrevor Phillips, the former head of the equalities and human rights commission, is understood to have questioned at the meeting why he was the only director among those supporting Mandelson to survive the cull. \u201cIs it because I is black?\u201d Phillips asked Rudd, and he insisted the exchange was minuted.\n\nIn an email sent on Monday to fellow directors, Phillips wrote that the organisation was now a laughing stock and was failing supporters of a second referendum.\n\nRudd, in a series of broadcast interviews, denied that a row was overtaking the organisation. He said: \u201cI think we are tantalisingly close to getting [a people\u2019s vote] or a confirmatory vote on the government\u2019s deal. Parliament has come closer to us than ever before and because of that we need to stay focused on the main prize and try not to fuel rows outside when we have to reverse this Brexit madness.\u201d\n\nAllies of Rudd said Mandelson and Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair\u2019s former director of communications, had previously tried to remove him as chairman. Emails leaked to the Mail on Sunday a week ago showed Campbell suggesting: \u201cI do not see how this gets done without a public battle and it should happen soon and be fast and brutal.\u201d\n\nThe latest bout of infighting exploded into the open on Sunday night after the Open Britain board under Rudd\u2019s chairmanship voted seven to three in favour of removing Baldwin and McGrory. Rudd then emailed staff saying McGrory and Baldwin were leaving their roles with immediate effect.\n\nHe said the organisation needed a new structure and a former Labour campaigns adviser, Patrick Heneghan, would be installed in their place to work on \u201cbuilding a new campaign, more professional and more in touch\u201d.\n\nRudd, the brother of the former cabinet minister Amber Rudd, was due to speak to staff in the office at 9am on Monday, but he sent Heneghan in his place and did a round of broadcast interviews in which he claimed \u201cthere is no row\u201d.\n\nAfter listening to Heneghan, dozens of staff walked out of the office on London\u2019s Millbank and reconvened at a cafe in a move to support McGrory and Baldwin. One of them, Richard Brooks, who is part of For Our Future\u2019s Sake, said FFS was \u201cnot consulted on these changes [and believes] that they are wrong and tantamount to a corporate coup\u201d.\n\nBaldwin said both he and McGrory intended to turn up to work as usual on Tuesday and attend a second meeting convened by Rudd at 10am to speak to staff.\n\nBaldwin said: \u201cDoes someone who does that ahead of this week in politics on Brexit really care about a people\u2019s vote and scrutiny of Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit? Or is it someone who is trying to gain complete control over the campaign? I think anyone who cares about remain and stopping Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit should think very hard whether they want to have anything to do with someone like Roland Rudd in any capacity.\u201d\n\nHowever, they could face difficulty trying to get into the office, as a People\u2019s Vote source said their passes have now been cancelled and security would prevent them from entering. Allies of Rudd said the move was necessary to move the campaign into a new phase and there had been questions over the competence of the fired staff members.", "description": "Staff plan to confront campaign chairman after walking out in support of fired pair", "authors": ["Rajeev Syal", "Rowena Mason"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81bc028d871b01e70195d4e09b2e4165d988580d/0_0_6388_3833/master/6388.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e002ce6aab9a18ea35c54accc4fc8376", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
