Nasdaq-100 futures added 23.25 points, or 0.3%, to 7,873.50.\n\nStocks put in a mixed performance Monday, with the Dow rising 14.92 points, or 0.1%, to 26,949.99, while the S&P 500 drifted lower by 0.29 point, or less than 0.1%, to 2,991.78. The Nasdaq Composite gave up 5.21 points, or 0.1%, to end at 8,112.46.\n\nWhat's driving the market?\n\nAnalysts said global equity markets appeared to be buoyed by modest optimism around U.S.-China talks after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin late Monday told Fox Business Network (link) (link) that U.S.-China trade talks would resume in two weeks in Washington and said that deputy-level negotiations between the two countries had made some progress.\n\nBut market participants are likely to take talk of progress with a grain of salt given past ups and downs in the long-running trade battle, which has seen Beijing and Washington engage in an escalating series of tariffs and countermeasures.\n\n\"The trade situation between the U.S. and China has calmed down compared with late August, but a certain level unease remains,\" said David Madden, market analyst at CMC, in a note.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.K.'s top court ruled that Prime Minister Boris Johnson violated the law (link) when he suspended Parliament this month, opening the way to further scrutiny of his Brexit plans. The British pound spiked versus the dollar (link) in the wake of the decision, while European equities remained higher.\n\nSee:Decision to suspend Parliament ruled unlawful -- live market reaction (link)\n\nMeanwhile, Germany's closely watched Ifo business climate index rose slightly to 94.6 in September (link)from 94.3 in August.

The expectations component of the index, however, fell to its lowest level since June 2009.\n\nFears over European economic growth were underlined Monday after purchasing managers index readings for the eurozone came in at multiyear lows.\n\nWhat stocks are in focus?\n\nShares of BlackBerry Ltd. (BB.T) fell 9% in premarket trade after posting weaker-than-expected numbers for its fiscal second quarter.\n\nCarMax Inc.(KMX) on Tuesday reported fiscal second-quarter profit and revenue that topped expectations (link), helped by strength in sales of used vehicles.\n\nWhat's on the economic calendar\n\nThe U.S. Case-Shiller home-price index for July is set for release at 9 a.m. Eastern, while a September consumer-confidence reading is due at 10 a.m. Eastern.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 24, 2019 07:23 ET (11:23 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
