Ragging on Ford has become Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s favorite pastime.\n\nLast week, he mentioned Ford seven times in about 30 minutes \u2014 equaling references to Conservative leader Andrew Scheer \u2014 during a campaign stop in Markham, a suburb in the Greater Toronto Area, or GTA. This bellwether battleground has about as many seats in Parliament as the entire province of Alberta, making it key to forming a majority government.\n\n\u201cWhere is Doug Ford \u2026 bound and gagged somewhere? He hasn\u2019t been seen in three months,\u201d James Maloney, a Liberal candidate in Ford\u2019s hometown of Etobicoke, joked during a debate last week.\n\nFord has not appeared alongside Scheer when the Conservative leader made major promises to invest in transit and make child care more affordable in the region.\n\nFord declined to be interviewed for this article, but during a press event on Wednesday, he dismissed Trudeau\u2019s comments as politics.\n\n\u201cI think the guy loves me because he constantly is mentioning my name,\u201d Ford added with a laugh.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to Justin Trudeau, he has a race to run,\u201d Ford said. \u201cI\u2019m focused on governing, very simple. I\u2019m not focused on campaigning.\u201d\n\nJenni Byrne, a longtime Conservative operative and former adviser to Ford, characterized Liberals\u2019 taunting as \u201cpolitical theater.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think people are reading into this much more than they should,\u201c Byrne said. \u201cThe provincial government has a ton of files that are hot. At the end of the day, I think [Ford] doesn\u2019t care to be dragged into the federal campaign.\u201c\n\n\n\nTrudeau may be equally polarizing after his own recent controversies. Last month, he apologized for donning black-and-brownface as a student in the 1990s and as a private school teacher in 2001.\n\nAnd in August, Canada\u2019s ethics commissioner determined that Trudeau improperly tried to shield a top engineering company from criminal charges \u2014 known as the SNC-Lavalin affair. Then there is the prime minister\u2019s divisive decision to purchase a $4.5 billion oil pipeline.\n\n\u201cMy job is to make the law, not break the law,\u201d Conservative challenger Barry O\u2019Brien said during the debate in Etobicoke. Even his mentions of Scheer were few and far between.\n\nAsked about whether Ford is a liability to his campaign, O\u2019Brien pivoted to the province\u2019s Liberal predecessor, Kathleen Wynne, whose party lost all but seven seats in provincial government elections last year. \u201cPeople still remember that. And those who worked for Wynne are now working for Trudeau in Ottawa,\u201d O\u2019Brien told POLITICO.\n\nThe Trudeau vs. Ford proxy fight poses problems for both Liberals and Conservatives as they jockey for Toronto and the city\u2019s fast-growing and multicultural suburbs. Interviews with two dozen voters of all ages and ethnic backgrounds reveal disillusionment with Trudeau, even as they express exasperation with Conservatives over Ford's policies.\n\nA recent survey by the Angus Reid Institute found that 42 percent of Ontarians won\u2019t vote for Scheer because of Ford. But Trudeau\u2019s approval rating has continued to slip this year, which could easily lead to a minority government on Oct. 21.\n\nThe path to victory hinges on the 30 ridings surrounding Toronto that Trudeau swept in 2015, when young voters \u2014 exhilarated by his promises to legalize marijuana, tackle climate change and reform the electoral system \u2014 turned out in record numbers.\n\nMultiple pit stops in the region by party leaders highlight its significance. Scheer pledged last week to fund two major transit projects, including one that would link Toronto to suburbs like Markham and Vaughn. Last Wednesday, Trudeau announced from a Chinese grocery store in Markham that his first act as a reelected prime minister would be tax cuts for the middle class.\n\nMarkham-Stouffville, where a former member of Trudeau\u2019s Cabinet is running as an Independent, as well as Brampton East, where an NDP candidate is trying to beat the odds, will be crucial tests. Across the GTA, electoral projections by 338Canada indicate a neck-and-neck race between Liberals and Conservatives.\n\n\n\nJane Philpott, the now-Independent candidate in a mostly middle-class suburb, hopes to capitalize on the anti-Trudeau sentiment. After publicly denouncing the prime minister\u2019s handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair earlier this year, she was ousted from the Liberal Party along with Jody Wilson-Raybould, Canada\u2019s first Indigenous Minister of Justice, who is also running as an Independent in Vancouver.\n\n\u201cI think [Trudeau] and our whole team were elected on a wave of optimism and hope that things would be done differently,\u201d Philpott told POLITICO during an interview in her campaign office in Stouffville, about 40 minutes northeast of Toronto bordered by farmland.\n\nPhilpott, a medical doctor by training, held numerous cabinet posts between 2015 and 2019. \u201cThere were some very important steps that were taken, like having a gender-balanced cabinet. But there have been disappointments.\u201d\n\nTrudeau has said he takes responsibility for mistakes he made, but disagrees with some of the ethics commission\u2019s findings. He also defends his actions as standing up for Canadian jobs, because a conviction of SNC-Lavalin could mean a 10-year ban on federal contracts. The company is headquartered in Montreal, another political battleground, but half of its nearly 9,000 Canadian employees work outside the province, CBC reported earlier this year. Liberal candidates for MP are making a similar case to voters.\n\nPhilpott thinks the race is between her and Liberal candidate Helena Jaczek, based on a small poll her campaign commissioned this month that showed Conservative support far behind.\n\nJaczek, a former Ontario health minister who lost her seat last year amid the Ford wave, told POLITICO that this isn\u2019t what she\u2019s hearing at the doors. She decided to run because of an outpouring of calls from community and party leaders.\n\nIn either case, Philpott is telling voters that she is their best shot at booting Trudeau from power. She argued that the Conservatives have no chance of prevailing in the riding, so people who want to see Trudeau out of power should vote for her.\n\n\u201cVoting for me is a way to help Trudeau go. It means one less Liberal seat. The Conservatives aren\u2019t going to win this seat,\u201d Philpott told Fonce Blommesstyn, an older Dutch Canadian, after he pulled into his driveway.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to vote for you. I\u2019m fed up with Trudeau,\u201d Blommesstyn said. \u201cI\u2019ve got only one choice, Trudeau or \u2026 .\u201d\n\n\u201cMe!\u201d Philpott interjected.\n\nHelen Leon, 71, said she has voted for several different parties over the years and is supporting Philpott this cycle. Asked why it isn\u2019t Conservatives: \u201cI have enough of Doug Ford here. They get too vicious with their cuts.\u201d\n\nFord last year canceled university expansions in three suburbs, including Markham and Brampton, to \u201crestore trust and accountability in Ontario\u2019s finances,\u201d citing a C$15 billion deficit. (The province recently revised that figure to C$7.4 billion for 2018-19.)\n\nThe premier reduced public college tuition 10 percent but simultaneously slashed spending on a loan and grant program that helps students pay for school. The move effectively eliminated fully covered tuition for families earning less than $50,000 a year, although in general a greater percentage of low-income students will receive a mix of aid.\n\nJust last week, tens of thousands of education workers in Ontario threatened to strike before reaching a deal with the Ford government, securing an extra C$100 million to support staff jobs and wage increases. This followed opposition to another Ford policy in March that increased classroom sizes over several years and led to teacher layoffs. The tussles have prompted a number of attack ads against the premier on the airwaves.\n\n\u201cDoug Ford says he\u2019s \u2018For the People,\u2019 but he\u2019s certainly not for our children and grandchildren,\u201d Jerry Dias, national president of the union group Unifor, said in a radio ad zeroing in on education, which aired during peak commute hours.\n\nThe NDP candidate in Brampton East, Saranjit Singh, said Ford\u2019s decision to cancel the university was \u201cshort-sighted.\u201d But voters he talks to are just as frustrated with Trudeau\u2019s party.\n\n\u201cWhen I ask people door-to-door, \u2018What have Liberals done for you?\u2019 most people will say nothing. Brampton has received nothing but cuts and neglect from the Liberals and the Conservatives,\u201d Singh said, noting that residents felt that way despite having Liberal MPs and a majority government since 2015.\n\nSingh is Sikh, just like Jagmeet Singh, the NDP party leader who previously represented Brampton at the provincial level. The suburb has one of the largest Sikh communities outside of India, on display by the shops in the strip mall where Saranjit Singh\u2019s campaign office is located. Across the street is a bright white gurdwara, where Sikhs worship.\n\nSingh, whose family immigrated to Canada in the 1980s through the refugee program and is now a labor lawyer, has an office humming with young volunteers, of which he has about 400.\n\nLast week, 338Canada projected Singh in third place. Fast forward to Monday, and he jumped ahead of the Conservative, but still lags 16 points behind the Liberal candidate.\n\nSingh echoes the NDP party leader in his pitch to progressive Canadians against strategic voting, hitting both Liberals and Conservatives. Strong action on climate change, reconciliation with Indigenous communities, and robust investments in affordable housing, transit and health care, won\u2019t materialize under the two main parties, he said.\n\n\u201cIf you vote for a party without looking at the candidate ... you risk our country not progressing. And that\u2019s a really big risk,\u201d Singh said.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/30/21/641dfa9c46c193896392dd86b3d0/190919-trudeau-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
