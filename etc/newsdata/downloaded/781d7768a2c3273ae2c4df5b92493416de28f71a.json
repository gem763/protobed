You split armrests with the passengers next to you and what little legroom you have with the passenger reclined in your lap. Naturally, you\u2019ll look for comfort in the little things \u2014 such as the ability to see out your aisle\u2019s window.\n\nDuring a recent flight, our managing editor Virginia lost out on this privilege when a fellow passenger in the window seat beside her closed the shade upon landing. (A \u201cmonster\u201d, she called him on Slack.) The window shade debate has become so contentious that even The Wall Street Journal and New York Magazine have taken sides \u2014 and not everyone seems to agree.\n\n\u201cAirline window shades should always be closed unless it\u2019s takeoff or landing,\u201d the New York Times\u2019 Michael Barbaro wrote on Twitter.\n\nSo who has the right to the window?\n\nYou Never Have To Swap Seats On A Flight On a recent Reddit thread, u/christontoast666 explained his moral dilemma when agreeing to switch seats on a flight with another passenger. \u201cI booked an aisle seat on a 12-hour flight to Europe, and when I got on the plane, a woman asked me if I would mind switching with her so she could sit with her kids,\u201d he wrote\u2060 \u2014 only to discover his new seat would be a middle one. \u201cSo I went back to my original seat and told the woman \u2018no,\u2019 and immediately, she got quite upset. I explained to her why I needed my aisle seat, but at this point, everyone was looking at me like I\u2019m this raging arsehole for separating a mum from her kids.\u201d Read more\n\nThere are a couple of factors to consider. For one, you\u2019ll notice that some airline attendants decidedly ask passengers to keep window shades up while taking off or landing; as we\u2019ve written about before, sometimes it\u2019s for the attendants to have better visibility in case of an emergency.\n\n(AirfareWatchDog points out that there\u2019s no federal law or rule in any airlines\u2019 contract of carriage on what you can do with your window shade, but I\u2019d defer to the attendants anyway.)\n\nOtherwise, between takeoff and landing, I\u2019ve long been under the impression that the window seat passenger \u2014 and they alone \u2014 have the right to open or close the shade at their discretion. There are two notable exceptions, however. If it\u2019s an early flight and passengers are sleeping, the window seat passenger should absolutely close the shade regardless of their preference.\n\nAnd the reverse applies to landing, as in Virginia\u2019s example. When the pilot announces that a flight\u2019s landing, the window passenger should always open the shade; for nervous flyers, an unobscured view can be comforting, and for everyone else, it\u2019s just nice to see the view from above, instead of the reclined seat centimetres away from you.", "description": "When you\u2019re on a flight, you lose all sense of physical boundaries.
