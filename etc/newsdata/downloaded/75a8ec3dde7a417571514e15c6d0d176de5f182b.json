Katie Hill resigns amid ethics probe into reported affair with staffer", "language": "en", "text": "Rep. Katie Hill, D-Calif., announced her resignation Sunday after a string of reports shining a negative light on her personal life, including a reported affair with her legislative director that sparked a House Ethics Committee investigation.\n\nHill tweeted on Sunday evening, \u201cIt is with a broken heart that today I announce my resignation from Congress. This is the hardest thing I have ever had to do, but I believe it is the best thing for my constituents, my community, and our country.\u201d She is expected to step down by the end of this week.\n\nThe congresswoman last week had fought back against reports of an affair with the congressional staffer, as well as reports she was in a so-called \u201cthrouple\u201d relationship with husband Kenny Heslep and a campaign staffer.\n\nREP. KATIE HILL FIGHTS BACK AMID CLAIMS SHE WAS INVOLVED IN ROMANTIC 'THROUPLE' WITH STAFFER\n\nThis past Thursday, the political fallout for Hill escalated as more compromising photos of the freshman lawmaker surfaced. The Daily Mail published one photo of what appeared to be Hill undressed and holding a bong, and another of her kissing the campaign staffer.\n\nThe photos emerged shortly after the conservative website RedState.org posted screenshots of several text messages between Hill and the staffer detailing the reported end of their three-person relationship earlier this year and reported on intimate pictures including a nude photo of Hill brushing the staffer\u2019s hair.\n\nAccording to the texts that were shown, Hill wanted to focus on her work and suggested that \u201cpolitical risk\u201d was a factor.\n\nFox News has not verified the authenticity of the photos.\n\nHill, in the letter announcing her resignation, wrote: \u201cThis is what needs to happen so that the good people who supported me will no longer be subjected to the pain inflicted by my abusive husband and the brutality of hateful political operatives who seem to happily provide a platform to a monster who is driving a smear campaign built around cyber exploitation.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cHaving private photos of personal moments weaponized against me has been an appalling invasion of my privacy. It\u2019s also illegal, and we are currently pursuing all of our available legal options.\u201d\n\nHill, an openly bisexual congresswoman and the vice chairwoman of the powerful House Oversight Committee, admitted Wednesday she had an \u201cinappropriate\u201d relationship with the female campaign staffer.\n\nREP. KATIE HILL ADMITS TO 'INAPPROPRIATE' RELATIONSHIP WITH CAMPAIGN STAFFER, VOWS TO COOPERATE WITH ETHICS PANEL\n\nIn a letter sent to constituents on Wednesday and obtained by Fox News, Hill acknowledged that in the final years of what she called an \u201cabusive marriage,\u201d she began a relationship with the unnamed campaign staffer.\n\nHeslep filed for divorce from Hill earlier this year.\n\n\u201cI am going through a divorce from an abusive husband who seems determined to try to humiliate me,\u201d Hill said in her statement last week. \u201cI am disgusted that my opponents would seek to exploit such a private matter for political gain. This coordinated effort to try to destroy me and the people close to me is despicable and will not succeed. I, like many women who have faced attacks like this before, am stronger than those who want me to be afraid.\u201d\n\nRedState also reported earlier this month that Hill had an extramarital affair with Graham Kelly, her legislative director and former campaign finance director, for at least a year. Heslep was said to have shared his own screenshot of a text exchange he had with a friend who had heard about the affair; it was later deleted from his Facebook account.\n\nThe reported affair with a congressional staffer prompted the House Ethics Committee investigation.\n\nAccording to RedState, the alleged affair was why Heslep filed for divorce. Hill has denied the affair with Kelly.\n\nRedState also published a series of purported late-night texts in which Heslep called into question Hill\u2019s drinking. Other texts showed the female staffer involved in the \u201cthrouple\u201d expressing concerns about Hill's drinking.\n\n\u201cI know that as long as I am in Congress, we\u2019ll live fearful of what might come next and how much it might hurt,\u201d Hill wrote in Sunday\u2019s statement. \u201cThat\u2019s a feeling I know all too well. It\u2019s the feeling I decided to leave when I left my marriage, and one I will not tolerate being forced upon others. I can no longer allow my community, family, friends, staff, supporters, and especially the children who look up to me as a role model, to suffer this unprecedented brand of cruelty.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nShe went on to apologize.\n\n\u201cFor the mistakes made along the way and the people who have been hurt, I am so sorry, and I am learning \u2013 I am not a perfect person and never pretended to be. It\u2019s one of the things that made my race so special,\u201d Hill wrote. \u201cI hope it showed others that they do belong, that their voice does matter, and that they do have a place in this country.\u201d\n\nFox News\u2019 Mike Arroyo, Ben Florance, Kevin Kirby, Chad Pergram and Andrew O\u2019Reilly contributed to this report.", "description": "Rep.
