Broadway into 44 high-end apartment units.\n\nThe apartments-in-a-garage officially opened on April 1, and about 20 of the units are already leased or pre-leased, according to Brittany Wahlers, assistant property manager at Broadway Autopark.\n\nExplore where you live.

Each floor has 10 apartments on the east side (each with a terrace overlooking Broadway) and a few parking spots (as well as one quirky unit) on the west side. Residents have doorside parking.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that you hear a lot about downtown is parking \u2013 even though there\u2019s plenty of parking, there\u2019s this perception that residential parking is hard to find,\u201d said Jeremy Luginbill, principal at Lifeboat Creative. The agency handles Bokeh Development\u2019s branding and public relations efforts.\n\n\u201c(Bokeh) kind of took what has always been a negative perception and flipped it on its head and said, \u2018Here you go, we\u2019ve got parking at the front door for anyone that\u2019s been an issue for.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a secured-access garage, as residents need a door opener or a code to get past the first floor.\n\nAll of the units are between 650 and 670 square feet, and they get progressively pricier the higher you go.\n\nRent ranges from $800 to $1,000 a month, depending on what floor the apartment is on.\n\nThey are all one-bedroom apartments with full-size kitchens (with a half-size dishwasher). All of the kitchen furnishings look starkly industrial against the concrete walls and ceilings \u2013 the cabinets, for example, look like repurposed black toolboxes (to fit the garage theme).\n\nSimilar to its fellow Bokeh property, The Lux, every apartment features an accent wall painted one of the three official colors of the complex: terra cotta, green or gold.\n\nEach apartment\u2019s balcony overlooking Broadway is only semi-private, separated from its neighbor by a waist-high wall.\n\n\u201cA lot of Bokeh Development\u2019s properties are about community and developing community,\u201d Luginbill said. \u201c(The low walls) are on purpose, to keep people engaged with each other.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a \u201ctrash chute\u201d on each floor of the garage, where residents can dump bags of trash that then plummet earthbound into a Dumpster.\n\nThe complex also has a first-floor common room equipped with a 24-hour fitness center, dog wash and entertainment room. In that common room, there are tinted windows original to the garage, Luginbill said \u2013 and painted parking lines still visible on the floor.\n\n\u201cIf you look at a lot of Bokeh Development\u2019s properties, they don\u2019t strip down to the studs; they don\u2019t tear it apart,\u201d Luginbill said. \u201cThey use as much as can be used there and build it up to what it potentially will be.\u201d\n\nConverting a pre-existing concrete parking garage into apartments was not particularly cost-effective, Luginbill said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more costly to do it that way, but (Bokeh\u2019s) philosophy is retaining that character, retaining what built Wichita downtown and carrying that into the future,\u201d Luginbill said. \u201cPutting up walls is fairly easy. It\u2019s getting all the electrical, plumbing and HVAC into a space that wasn\u2019t intended to have it originally.\u201d\n\nUnlike The Lux, which prides itself on its LEED certification of energy efficiency, Broadway Autopark is not LEED-certified, \u201cbut we did every step to make it as green as possible and as energy-efficient as possible,\u201d Wahlers said.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly how expensive the project was, as Luginbill said \u201cthat\u2019s not stuff that Bokeh shares.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, the Eagle reported the project was expected to cost around $5 million.\n\nThere\u2019s talk about adding a rooftop patio to the Broadway Autopark later, but that hasn\u2019t been finalized.\n\nHistory of the garage\n\nKnightley\u2019s Parking Garage \u2013 now known as Broadway Autopark \u2013 has been a staple of the downtown landscape since it was built in 1949.\n\nIt\u2019s a popular subject of downtown photography, and recently a Rose Hill student\u2019s drawing of the building was awarded top honors at the Scholastic Art and Writing Awards.\n\nThe Modern-style parking garage, with rounded walls and porthole windows, was built as the post-war automobile industry boomed.\n\nWealthy Wichitans would drop their cars off with a valet at the garage before going shopping downtown. As customers shopped, downtown merchants would ship their purchases to Knightley\u2019s Parking Garage. The parking attendants would use a dumbwaiter to go between floors.\n\nThere was a safe used to guard valuable purchases and an air-conditioned waiting room in the garage.\n\nThe garage was open 24/7, 365 days a year until the early 1980s, when it was shuttered.\n\nIt sat vacant and trash-filled for the next few decades, until Ramsey and fellow developer Robert Eyster got hold of the building in 2016.\n\n\u201cIt was rough \u2014 not structurally, but cosmetically it was a disaster,\u201d Luginbill said. \u201cThere was trash everywhere. There was graffiti all over the walls.\u201d\n\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places later that year, and the renovations began. The city also loaned Bokeh Development $620,000 for fa\u00e7ade improvements at the garage property in 2016.\n\nInside the office area, crews found parking tickets that they estimated had been on the ground there \u201cat least 30-plus years,\u201c Luginbill said.\n\nThe renovations took a little more than two years to complete.\n\nBroadway Autopark is a few blocks south of where a mass of downtown apartments have clustered in recent years along Douglas and areas northward. It\u2019s also the first new downtown apartment complex to bear a Broadway address.\n\n\u201cIt just shows the expansion of what downtown is going to be \u2013 it\u2019s pushing that core outward and creating more interest in downtown as a whole, not just the same street,\u201d Luginbill said. \u201cIt\u2019s just another step in that evolution of downtown.\u201d\n\nIt's just across the street from the former Greyhound Bus building \u2014 recently abandoned \u2014 and rises up among surface parking lots in the block.\n\nBut there's hope that Broadway Autopark will be the catalyst for future developments along the Broadway corridor, which is the \"primary north-south spine\" of downtown, said Jason Gregory, executive vice president of Downtown Wichita.\n\n\"Sometimes it just takes that first project to spark an area, and we think it has the potential to do that,\" Gregory said. \"You have the critical mass of the former state office building, the Henry's \u2014 those are prime for redevelopment, too. If \u2014 not if, when \u2014 those are activated, there's a lot of connectivity there.\"\n\nThe apartments were designed by Shelden Architecture, and Farha Construction (which now has offices in the building's ground floor) was the contractor for the project.\n\nFor more information about the building, visit www.broadwayautopark.com.", "description": "The Broadway Autopark, a 44-unit residential complex, opened on April 1.
