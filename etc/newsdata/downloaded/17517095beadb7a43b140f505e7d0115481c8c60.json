The utility also said its equipment was found damaged near the site of two smaller fires over the weekend, one of which burned a tennis club to the ground.\n\nThe fires have deepened the sense of frustration felt by local residents and politicians as California\u2019s largest utility company embarks on an unprecedented schedule of forced blackouts. Buried in a contentious bankruptcy proceeding, unable to pay victims of past fires and preparing for the danger of hurricane-like winds, PG&E tried to stave off more damage and future liability by turning off power to more than 2 million customers. PG&E serves about 16 million customers over 70,000 square miles in Northern and Central California.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe blackouts may have helped contain the destruction; as of Tuesday, no deaths had been reported in connection to the fires, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.\n\nBut the blowback from residents who have been forced to live on generators and batteries, and the growing concern that the power shut-offs have failed to prevent the exact problem they were designed to solve, have plunged PG&E into deeper political and financial crisis.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019ve been supporting their shareholders and executives more than they\u2019ve been looking out for the public,\u201d said Randy Harris, the owner of a Santa Rosa-based gift shop that has lost customers because of the blackouts.\n\nAD\n\nNorthern California is bracing for another windstorm that could complicate efforts to contain the Kincade Fire, which has forced nearly 200,000 wine country residents to evacuate and is moving steadily toward the city of Santa Rosa. The National Weather Service issued a wind advisory for parts of Sonoma and Napa counties between noon Tuesday and 11 a.m. Wednesday, with the strongest gusts expected overnight. The increased wind will create \u201crapid fire growth potential,\u201d the Weather Service said.\n\nAD\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom (D) stepped up his criticism of PG&E in a news conference Monday, calling PG&E\u2019s plan to implement blackouts over the next 10 years \u201cunacceptable\u201d and publicly soliciting Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway to make a takeover offer to bail out the embattled utility company.\n\nPG&E\u2019s stock price has plummeted more than 40 percent in the past week as evidence began pointing to the utility company\u2019s aging infrastructure as a possible cause of the Sonoma fire. Citi analyst Praful Mehta predicted the company\u2019s equity value could soon fall to zero, as the new fires have created the potential for even more liabilities the company can\u2019t afford to pay.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lose-lose situation right now for the utility,\u201d Mehta said in an interview. \u201cThey switch off power; everybody\u2019s upset. If they don\u2019t switch off the power, and there are fires, everybody is still upset.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWith the pool of investors willing to support PG&E shrinking, the bankrupt utility is not in a position to address the underlying problems with its aging infrastructure, which would require many years, billions of dollars and innovative steps such as moving power lines underground, said Michael Wara, director of the Climate and Energy Policy Program at Stanford Law School.\n\n\u201cSomeone has to invest,\u201d Wara said. \u201cThose people will have to be excited about loaning money to PG&E. Those people have to have a perception that PG&E is a low-risk investment \u2014 it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThis predicament is increasing the likelihood of a public takeover of the utility, Wara said. \u201cYou may have to hitch it to something that can borrow money or give it a decent credit rating.\u201d The utility\u2019s largest remaining shareholders include hedge funds Abrams, Baupost, Knighthead and Appaloosa.\n\nAD\n\nOn Tuesday, PG&E began its third series of power shut-offs, expected to affect 600,000 customers across the Bay Area.\n\n\u201cOur sole purpose of implementing power shut-offs is to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire,\u201d said Ari Vanrenen, a PG&E spokeswoman. \u201cWe recognize the hardship of not having electric service and what that puts on our customers.\"\n\nAD\n\nPG&E says it had shut off electricity to the local distribution lines in Sonoma County at the time the Kincade Fire started. But electricity still flowed through what are called transmission lines, which carry power over a larger region, according to Ian Hiskens, a University of Michigan engineering professor who specializes in power system dynamics and grid controllability.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re the freeways of the electricity system,\u201d Hiskens said of the transmission lines.\n\nAD\n\nThe major transmission routes \u2014 which involve higher wiring and better clearing \u2014 can\u2019t be cut without even larger disruptions. If the transmission lines were to be shut down, power routed from energy suppliers in Oregon and the Pacific Northwest wouldn\u2019t make its way through California to locations as far south as Los Angeles, Hiskens said.\n\nAD\n\nThe fires that started on Sunday in the suburbs east of San Francisco fell just outside PG&E\u2019s blackout region, Vanrenen said. That illustrated the \u201congoing, dynamic\u201d nature of the high winds, which make it difficult to predict what areas are prone to fire, she added.\n\nPG&E\u2019s power shut-off plan follows a similar approach to wildfire prevention taken by San Diego Gas & Electric over the past decade. Following 2007 fires that burned hundreds of homes in the city and killed two residents, SDP&E began using \u201csurgical\u201d shut-offs to its electrical grid to prevent fires, said Katie Bays, co-founder of research and consulting firm Sandhill Strategy.\n\nAD\n\nThe approach taken by PG&E, by contrast, \u201cis like taking a sledgehammer to the grid,\u201d Bays said.\n\nAD\n\nExperts who study energy and the power grid said reoccurring planned shut-offs of this scale are unprecedented. Developing countries conduct targeted power shut-offs for hours at a time to prevent an overloading of the power supply, but days-long outages aren\u2019t the norm even in countries with weak power grids, Hiskens said.\n\n\u201cIn India, for example, everyone knows the power\u2019s going to go out, so they have their backup generator,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir lifestyle is built around losing their power regularly. In first-world countries, when the power goes out, people are like, \u2018What the heck just happened?\u2019 and within a short period of time the fridges are not that cold anymore.\u201d\n\nIn areas of California where power shut-offs were beginning to hit more regularly, they have begun to affect businesses and vulnerable populations who rely on electricity to survive.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn a letter to Newsom this week, U.S. Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie raised \u201cserious concerns\u201d that the PG&E blackouts could endanger the veterans in the region who require regular care.\n\n\u201cPower outages could become dangerous for veterans receiving in-home care and those who rely on power for the refrigeration of life saving medications like insulin,\u201d Wilkie said in the letter.\n\nTyler Radak, 29, who lives in Moraga, Calif. with her husband and their 18-month-old daughter, said they were spending nights huddled around a gas fireplace to stay warm, with the baby wrapped in two layers of fleece. This weekend, with an electric stove unusable, they heated water and grilled food using a propane barbecue outside.\n\nThe shut-offs, said Radak, entail \u201ctrying to cook before everything goes off, trying to get laundry done before it all goes off, trying to plan ahead and have things on the counter that don\u2019t need to be refrigerated so I can try to feed my daughter.\u201d She said when the power turns back on they charge up a supply of portable batteries to keep their devices working.\n\nThe family has their documents packed away in case they need to leave, and they\u2019re stashing supplies such as diapers.\n\nShe had a simple message for PG&E: \u201cFind the budget to bury the power lines.\u201d\n\nHeather Kelly contributed to this story.", "description": "The fires have deepened the sense of frustration felt by local residents and politicians as California\u2019s largest utility company embarks on an unprecedented schedule of forced blackouts.", "authors": ["Douglas Macmillan", "Reporter Covering Corporate Accountability", "Faiz Siddiqui", "San Francisco-Based Tech Reporter Covering Automation", "The Future Of Transportation", "Including Tesla", "Uber"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/sddPXSg1ud3A1n3ropniwy3jTT8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HYIUWEHWIYI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
