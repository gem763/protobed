Photo: Joshua Lott/Getty Images\n\nBen: This week, Elizabeth Warren said that she would forgo high-dollar fundraisers in a general-election campaign against President Trump. She had previously maintained that she would drop this rule, which she has been following during the primaries, if she won the nomination, saying that she is not a fan of \u201cunilateral disarmament.\u201d Will her change of heart put her at a disadvantage?\n\nJosh: I don\u2019t think we know. The argument against doing this, obviously, is that these fundraisers can bring in a lot of money, some of which she won\u2019t collect if she doesn\u2019t do them. And it\u2019s not just money for her own campaign, but for the Democratic National Committee and for state Democratic Parties, which use the funds to support Democratic efforts more broadly.\n\nBut there are empirical questions we don\u2019t have answers to: How much money actually won\u2019t be donated, which she would have managed to raise if she did these appearances like other nominees typically have? Can she use a promise not to do such fundraising to generate more grassroots money, or will she be rewarded for it by voters? And \u2014 I think most importantly \u2014 how will she spend the time that is freed up by avoiding the time suck that is high-dollar fundraising?\n\nEric: Yes. There\u2019s also the question of whether money lost from holding such fundraisers will just be diverted into pro-Warren super-PACs. On the one hand, given the meteoric rise of online fundraising \u2014 and the eagerness of the Democrats\u2019 (increasingly deep-pocketed) base to fight Trumpism with their wallets \u2014 it isn\u2019t that hard to see Warren keeping her coffers full without meeting and greeting big-dollar donors.\n\nJosh: I\u2019m confused about why declining to engage in glad-handing would lead to more money in super-PACs.\n\nEric: The super PACs could hold glitzy fundraisers even if the Warren campaign doesn\u2019t.\n\nJosh: The DNC and the state parties can hold the glitzy fundraisers, too, and they will. The question is whether donors, who expect to be able to come see the candidate and, with a high enough ticket price, talk with the candidate, will be willing to write the checks if they don\u2019t get to do that. I think one point in favor of Warren\u2019s strategy is: Why do people write large checks to political campaigns and parties? If they\u2019re writing the checks because they hope to get access, they may already be sour on Warren, which makes this sort of stuff a less efficient use of her time than it would be for another nominee. And if they\u2019re writing the checks just because they are ideologically motivated, her rule may allow her to collect that money more efficiently: Those donors might like face time with the candidate, but if they know nobody is getting it, maybe they will still send their checks anyway.\n\nBen: Matt Yglesias tweeted this morning that one of the problems with Warren\u2019s approach is that \u201cevery time Warren has a second- or third-degree interaction with a donor it will be reported as a hypocrisy story while Trump continues to collect bribes through his hotels on a daily basis with no reaction.\u201d What do you make of that argument?\n\nJosh: What I lay out there is an argument for why it might (might! not saying it is) be a good decision for her to choose to continue not spending time on this during a general election. That doesn\u2019t mean she needs to make a public commitment to it.\n\nEric: I feel like those kind of stories would be written about Warren either way.\n\nJosh: I tend to think, in general, campaign-finance issues move very few voters, especially in general elections. So I\u2019m not sure it matters if Warren gets attacked over that later.\n\nEric: I think one potentially awkward aspect of Warren\u2019s stance is that lower-profile, down-ballot Democrats can\u2019t afford to emulate her example. So if Warren effectively equates glad-handing with corruption, then she\u2019ll be tacitly accusing virtually every other Democrat of that sin.\n\nJosh: On the other hand, if Warren doesn\u2019t spend her time courting high-dollar donors, those donors might divert more of their donations toward down-ballot candidates who are willing to attend fundraisers.\n\nEric: True. Or potentially true.\n\nJosh: I think people are looking too hard for a general principle here, and I think it\u2019s quite possible that Warren has good reasons to adopt this strategy that aren\u2019t necessarily generalizable. I think people are looking at it too much as an ideological decision and not enough as a tactical one.\n\nEric: Do you think announcing this pledge now has tactical value in the primary?\n\nJosh: I don\u2019t know how much it matters in the primary \u2014 presumably, if it helps that\u2019s because it covers her left flank. You\u2019re probably better positioned to get inside the head of a Bernie voter than I am.\n\nEric: I can see the argument that this sort of gesture isn\u2019t going to win over Bernie diehards, even as it risks feeding concerns about electability (though I sorta doubt it\u2019ll have much impact whatsoever).\n\nJosh: I do have an idea about \u201cwhy now\u201d though: She\u2019s had another eight months of experience campaigning, and the campaign has a better sense of how it can raise money, and might be more confident it can honor the pledge.\n\nBen: She did raise the second most of any primary contender last quarter, trailing only Bernie Sanders, who also shuns big donors.\n\nJosh: And she has dry powder. A lot of those Establishment figures who wrote max-out checks to Joe Biden will end up writing checks to her if she is the nominee,\n\nwhereas I don\u2019t know how many of her grassroots donors will give to Biden if he is nominated.\n\nBen: To what extent do you think a Democratic nominee who DOES attend some glitzy galas will depress donations among small donors? is this something most voters care that much about?\n\nJosh: In a general election, I don\u2019t think so. I understand fighting over it in a primary \u2014 you\u2019re trying to figure out which candidate is MOST committed to your values, and how they raise money is a signal of that. In a general election, I don\u2019t see how this creates daylight versus Donald Trump.\n\nEric: I sorta doubt it. I think the benefit is probably going to come more in the form of saved time than more grassroots funding.\n\nJosh: Yeah, I think people really underrate that aspect \u2014 this frees up a ton of time.\n\nEric: Another point that Sean McElwee raised on Twitter: In recent presidential history, these closed-door events have tended to produce monumental gaffes. The deplorables remark, cling to your guns, the 47 percent \u2014 all came when candidates let their hair down in front of their favorite rich people.\n\nJosh: Oh god, yes. I\u2019d put it slightly differently: Candidates direct their comments to the interests of an audience, and these audiences have different interests than the electorate. Whether that\u2019s harsher economic messages (\u201c47 percent\u201d) or excessively contemptuous cultural messages (\u201cdeplorables\u201d).\n\nNow, a disciplined candidate should be careful about that. This comes up in other situations too: You shouldn\u2019t say something to an activist group you wouldn\u2019t want in the paper, either. But yeah, it\u2019s one less venue to screw up in.", "description": "Intelligencer staffers discuss the Massachusetts senator\u2019s aversion to a time-honored candidate pastime.", "authors": ["Josh Barro", "Benjamin Hart", "Eric Levitz"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/09/09-elizabeth-warren.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
