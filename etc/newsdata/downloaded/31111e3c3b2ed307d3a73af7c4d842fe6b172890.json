As someone who falls squarely into the first category (see: my cat tree made from real bark and silken leaves), I was excited for the opportunity to test out a few products from the carefully curated selection of Tuft & Paw.\n\nIn case you haven\u2019t been keeping up with your luxury cat-accessory news, Tuft & Paw brings some of the world\u2019s most unique and aesthetically pleasing pet brands (most of which aren\u2019t otherwise available in the U.S.) together under one virtual roof. There are plush faux-fur beds and sleek scratching towers from Germany-based MiaCara; leather and suede collars from London\u2019s Cheshire & Wain; and a handful of goodies from Korean brands, like a multilevel climbing tree from Pote (that\u2019s been featured in Dezeen), sculptural bowls from Inherent, and realistic-looking fish toys from Howlpot. Instead of plastic and cardboard, most of Tuft & Paw\u2019s products are made from high-quality natural materials like wool, birchwood, and linen. This means they\u2019re often more attractive than cheaper finds (the store has been dubbed \u201cthe West Elm for cats,\u201d after all), and also, based on how the toys I tested have held up, more durable in the face of cats\u2019 sharp teeth and claws.\n\nAs you might suspect from a high-end pet-accessory retailer, the products are pricey. They range from Inherent\u2019s $19 doughnut-shaped catnip toys to Pote\u2019s $999 fish-shaped bed. But Tuft & Paw founder Jackson Cunningham believes there\u2019s a market for the type of fancy stuff he\u2019s selling because, as a cat owner, he says he\u2019s always struggled to find toys and gear beyond the uninspiring, utilitarian products on most pet stores\u2019 shelves. \u201cThe pet industry as a whole has gotten a bit stagnate,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are not a ton of companies making really high-quality and beautiful stuff.\u201d Besides being attractive to humans, the pieces sold by Tuft & Paw have features that also make them functional and appealing to cats. Kitties who feel safe in enclosed spaces will surely gravitate toward houses like this tent from Poland\u2019s Hello Pets, while those who prefer to survey their territory from above will likely love these wall-mounted \u2014 and thus, space-saving \u2014 perches from the (coincidentally also Polish) brand Cosy and Dozy. Most of the toys are stuffed with tantalizing catnip, and even those elegant collars have a quick-release breakaway clip to prevent choking in case they get caught on anything.\n\nAfter Tuft & Paw sent me a few products to sample, I let my 8-year-old tabby Lovey have at them for a week or so. What follows are my observations of her time with the stuff \u2014 all of which I\u2019ve decided is probably worth paying a premium for. Not only because it\u2019s cat-friendly, but, perhaps more importantly to me, because the products\u2019 modern look blends in so much better with my living-room d\u00e9cor than any standard-issue cat accessories I\u2019ve owned.\n\nProducts I\u2019ve tried\n\nThe Royal Grocery Fish Bone The size and shape makes this similar to one of Lovey\u2019s all-time favorite toys (the catnip banana), so it wasn\u2019t surprising that she took to it immediately. Toys like this are sometimes called \u201ckickers\u201d because cats will hold them in their front paws and then kick at them with their feet. It\u2019s actually very adorable to watch and, I imagine, fun for kitty to do. Like Lovey\u2019s beloved banana, this is also stuffed with catnip, so she was quickly drawn in, and it even comes with a spare satchel of catnip to sprinkle on top. The bone-shaped (and bone-colored) toy is made from natural linen that, so far, seems pretty tough. I\u2019ve seen my cat rip open other catnip toys in just one or two play sessions, so it\u2019s nice to see that this one still looks brand new after being kicked, bitten, and clawed at. $29 at Tuft & Paw Buy\n\nHowlpot Salmon Tail While most of the stuff you\u2019ll find at Tuft & Paw is neutral-hued, here\u2019s something a little more vivid. Designed to look just like a salmon tail, this toy isn\u2019t quite as on-brand as the rest of the earth-toned selection, but it sort of reminds me of an Areaware food puzzle in how it\u2019s photo-realistic in a cool way. Like the Fish Bone, it\u2019s a good size and shape for cats to play with, and filled with catnip. Needless to say, Lovey pounced on it without any encouragement from me, and it\u2019s made of a thick (but soft) cotton that\u2019s been holding up well so far. $19 at Tuft & Paw Buy\n\nInherent Choco Tent I have to admit that I like this teepee more than Lovey does. She\u2019s definitely more of a climbing cat who enjoys perching up high and watching the world below her, so I suspected she wouldn\u2019t be into cuddling in this small space. It\u2019s a very nice product, though, with a sturdy wood base and a canvas cover that\u2019s secured with a series of snaps and rubber bands to withstand rowdy cats. It comes with Ikea-style (diagrams; no words) instructions and I was able to assemble it on my own in about ten minutes. While Lovey hasn\u2019t expressed much interest in the tent yet, I haven\u2019t given up on her. It comes with a fluffy cushion to line the base, and I suspect that might make her feel a little cramped inside, so I\u2019m planning on replacing the cushion with a flatter pillow or just a soft T-shirt. I am committed to getting her to like it because I really want to keep the tent in the living room. It\u2019s just that cute. If you know your cat is the type to enjoy an enclosed house, it\u2019s worth the investment for an actually attractive object that\u2019ll give her a place to get cozy. Otherwise, I\u2019d go for one of the perches or trees. $249 at Tuft & Paw Buy\n\nOther products I\u2019d like to try\n\nPote Milo Cat Tree I don\u2019t have the space or money for another fancy cat tree, but if I did, I would consider splurging on this very impressive one. I can see Lovey scampering up the ramp to reach the highest post and getting a good stretch on the long scratching pole. Instead of cardboard and sisal, the scratching surfaces are made from carpeting and heavy-duty rope that both looks nicer and will likely last longer. It\u2019s without a doubt a splurge (and actually more expensive than my custom cat tree), but instead of looking like an actual tree, it has a more contemporary style that might work better depending on your space. $949 at Tuft & Paw Buy\n\nFelix Katnip Tree Company Turrim What I do have the space and money for is a smaller scratching post, and cat owners know you can never have enough of them. Besides looking like it\u2019d last a long time, this minimalist one has a catnip-infused core that makes it even more attractive to cats than your furniture. $129 at Tuft & Paw Buy\n\nMiaCara Tosca Cat Carrier I\u2019d much rather take Lovey to the vet in this nubuck leather tote-style carrier than my current bulky one. It has cutouts for ventilation that also let cats peek out, a washable insert, and a front zipper on one side for easily loading your kitty in and out. The nice thing about the bag is that, if you\u2019re looking at it from the side without the zipper, it just looks like a leather tote with an interesting pattern, so passersby would never realize there\u2019s a cat inside. $499 at Tuft & Paw Buy\n\nInherent Meogda Mat The plastic mat I have under Lovey\u2019s food and water bowl is starting to show its age. This easy-to-clean silicone one comes in a bunch of colors, but I\u2019m partial to the \u201cSeaweed Green.\u201d Of course I\u2019d also need the matching bowl and stand. $29 at Tuft & Paw Buy\n\nThe Royal Grocery Fish & Chews This aesthetically pleasing update to the ever-popular wand toy replaces the plastic rod with a birchwood one that cats can safely chew on, and the feathers (that inevitable get torn out) with a wool ball and cotton fish that look sturdy. It\u2019s something that would surely get my cat excited to exercise, and also wouldn\u2019t look bad left out on the floor. $29 at Tuft & Paw Buy\n\nMiaCara Capello This faux-fur bed just looks ridiculously cozy, not to mention kind of elegant \u2014 way nicer than your standard, overstuffed brown-polyester model. Come next spring, there will be even more products available when Tuft & Paw launches its own line. Pieces I\u2019m excited about include a streamlined litter box with an integrated shovel and dust bin, and what Cunningham teases as a new take on the cat perch. \u201cThe more we\u2019re working in the space, the more we realize how manys opportunities there still are,\u201d he says, adding that designing products in-house will help make the entire inventory \u201cmore accessible to everyone.\u201d $169 at Tuft & Paw Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
