Democrats, led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, have now turned lustful eyes toward the oceans, hoping to create the same type government regulations over water with a \u201cBlue New Deal\u201d that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s now-famous Green New Deal imposed over land.\n\nOne if by land, two if by sea. High-fives all around for the brave new world of control the Democrats would love to see.\n\nThe idea popped at CNN\u2019s climate town hall of a few days ago when a member of the audience named Bren Smith who identified as a fisherman \u2014 yes, \u201cfisherman\u201d-slash-paid-Democrat-plant \u2014 oh-so-coyly asked that if Americans are so focused on climate change\u2019s effects on land, shouldn\u2019t Americans also be concerned about the 70 percent of the earth that\u2019s not land, but rather water?\n\nDo we need a \u201cBlue New Deal\u201d for the oceans?\n\nAnd Warren, on cue, jumped with excitement.\n\n\u201cI like that,\u201d she said, The Hill reported. \u201cHe\u2019s got it exactly right, we need a Blue New Deal.\u201d\n\nWell, well, well. For watchers of politics, this is hardly a surprise.\n\nThe left, along with the United Nations, has been steadily trying to control not just land, but also waterways for decades. And the airspace over the land and waterways, too.\n\nThink United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea, a treaty that would rip away any lingering freedom-of-the-seas doctrines \u2014 a \u201cprinciple put forth in the 17th century, essentially limiting national rights and jurisdiction over the oceans to a narrow belt of sea surrounding a national\u2019s coastline,\u201d as the United Nations puts it. And in its place, LOST would instill global controls, regulations, restrictions \u2014 and pay-for-access fees.\n\nFormer President Ronald Reagan hated LOST.\n\nIn radio remarks delivered in 1978, Reagan said \u201cno nat[ional] interest of ours could justify handing sovereign control of two-thirds of the earth\u2019s surface over to the Third World.\u201d\n\nQuite right.\n\nNo doubt, today\u2019s Democrats would argue the Blue New Deal is not one and the same as a U.N. treaty \u2014 and that the Blue New Deal would be a document to protect, not regulate and control.\n\nBut it\u2019s all the same.\n\nIt\u2019s all the same climate change controlling crap. And when they have control of the land, and the sea, guess what\u2019s next? The air. The galaxies and space.\n\nThe logic will be this: that it\u2019s impossible to monitor and control what gets dropped onto the lands and into the waters without having the ability to restrict what flies over the lands and waters.\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled. There\u2019s nothing new about this Blue New Deal. It\u2019s globalist elitism, at its worst. It\u2019s the left\u2019s latest power-grabbing, sovereign-stripping, soul-killing, freedom-trouncing, anti-American Trojan horse-like gift, wrapped in a climate alarmism bow.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
