We are ready to give the US embassy a map of Russia,\u201d the ministry added.\n\nThe blast at the military test site in August killed at least five people and caused panic after radiation levels jumped to 16 times their normal levels in nearby Severodvinsk.\n\nRussian authorities have given little information about the accident. But a US diplomat this week said that the accident took place when Russia attempted to retrieve a nuclear-powered cruise missile called Burevestnik from the Barents Sea.\n\n\u201cThe United States has determined that the explosion near Nyonoksa was the result of a nuclear reaction that occurred during the recovery of a Russian nuclear-powered cruise missile,\u201d Thomas DiNanno, the diplomat, said during a speech at the UN.\n\nRussia\u2019s plans for a nuclear-powered cruise missile that could in theory fly indefinitely were first revealed by Vladimir Putin during a speech last year. The missile is still undergoing testing, and some weapons experts doubt if it can ever be made operable.\n\nRussia\u2019s military was attempting to retrieve the missile from another failed 2017 test when the accident took place.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether the diplomats were traveling to or from Nyonoksa, the village near the military testing site, when they were detained. But train timetables would indicate they were returning from the village when they were arrested close to 6pm in Severodvinsk.\n\nRussia has maintained a shroud of secrecy around the incident, closing off waters in the White Sea to foreign ships to prevent them from collecting information about the explosion.", "description": "Russian foreign ministry said trio detained on train near Severodvinsk had named a different city as their destination and had obviously got lost\u2019", "authors": ["Andrew Roth"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4ef0d895720811d87b5e09619045f2722660917/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c05ad98394bdc86df48a5c682977a9a4", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
