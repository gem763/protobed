He [Zucker] hates him. He\u2019s going to be negative.\u201d\n\nPART 1: CNN Insider Blows Whistle, Secretly Records Staff, Execs and Network President Jeff Zucker\u2019s \u201cAnti-Trump Crusade\u201d and \u201cPersonal Vendetta\u201d Against POTUS.\n\n\n\n#ExposeCNN\n\n\n\nFull video uploading now\u2026sign up now to get each new tape first: https://t.co/kDe3HDdX2r pic.twitter.com/KKfaK6hvgW \u2014 James O\u2019Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) October 14, 2019\n\n\n\nCNN spokesman Matt Dornic did not deny the identify of network employees featured in the undercover sting by Project Veritas, which has targeted several prominent left-tilting media outlets since Mr. Trump took office, but dismissed the report as unworthy of comment.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s really nothing to comment on,\u201d Mr. Dornic said in an email.\n\nYawn \u2014 Matt Dornic (@mdornic) October 14, 2019\n\n\n\nCary Poarch, a contractor and satellite uplink technician for CNN in D.C., said he wore a hidden camera and recorded the daily \u201c9 a.m. rundown call\u201d led by Mr. Zucker, who can be heard pushing for the cable network to \u201cstay very focused on impeachment.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re moving towards impeachment,\u201d Mr. Zucker said in the audio. \u201cI mean, don\u2019t like, you know \u2014 we shouldn\u2019t pretend, oh, this is going one way. And so all these moves are moves toward impeachment. So don\u2019t lose sight of what the biggest story is.\u201d\n\nIn another clip, Mr. Zucker also told staff it was time to \u201ccall out\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican.\n\n\u201cI know that there\u2019s a lot of people at CNN that are friendly with Lindsey Graham. Time to knock that off,\u201d Mr. Zucker said in the audio. \u201cAnd it\u2019s time to call him out.\u201d\n\nThose commenting on social media said the video revealed beyond a doubt CNN\u2019s anti-Trump agenda and political bias, while others downplayed the report\u2019s significance.\n\n\u201cMissed the part where any of this is bad,\u201d tweeted filmmaker Jeremy Newberger. \u201cJeff Zucker telling people not to buy Lindsey Graham\u2019s bull\u2013t or someone on the call accurately describing Fox News? You gotta have something a little more smoking yes? Your disgruntled satellite op ain\u2019t quite Deepthroat.\u201d\n\nIn one clip, a man identified as CNN floor coordinator Hiram Gonzalez referred to the network\u2019s role in promoting Mr. Trump, who has been credited with juicing the network\u2019s flagging ratings during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cBetween you and I, we created this monster and now we\u2019re eating him full plate every single day,\u201d Mr. Gonzalez said. \u201cMedia created the Trump monster.\u201d\n\nCNN has faced criticism from both the right and left for its Trump coverage. Both Mr. Trump and conservatives have accused the network of an anti-Trump bias, while the left blamed CNN for propelling the Republican\u2019s 2016 rise with its heavy coverage.\n\nMr. Zucker has been upfront about how Mr. Trump drives ratings, telling Vanity Fair in a 2018 interview that when CNN stops covering Mr. Trump, \u201cthe audience goes away.\u201d\n\nCNN staffers caught on undercover video also referred to anti-GOP bias.\n\n\u201cOur Democratic interviews are softballs compared to the Republicans,\u201d said a man identified as media coordinator Christian Sierra.\n\nIn another clip, Mr. Neville said CNN journalists struggle with the anti-Trump push.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s difficult is like, we have some conflicting things at play here,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people out here just trying to do what they think is the best of journalistic integrity. Then you get on the 9 a.m. call and big boss Jeff Zucker f\u2013ing tells you what to do.\u201d\n\nMr. Poarch said that he initially considered working for CNN a \u201cdream job,\u201d but that it \u201cturned into a nightmare,\u201d based on a culture he described as the \u201cI hate Trump train.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe [Zucker] was calling Fox News fake news and a propaganda machine, and with what I saw, that\u2019s pretty much what CNN was,\u201d Mr. Poarch said in the Project Veritas video report. \u201cLike, it\u2019s just pumping out propaganda.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, he said not all those working at CNN subscribed to the \u201cgroupthink,\u201d saying \u201cmany of them felt the same way. They felt trapped that they couldn\u2019t say it.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
