Leaders there have been warning of possible service cuts and layoffs even as they plan to hire a small army of new officers, an endeavor that will cost a significant, but undisclosed amount of money.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate the comptroller validating the dire financial condition the MTA has been talking about for months,\u201d said MTA spokesperson Tim Minton.\n\nThe MTA\u2019s insistence on its financial fragility is why its decision to move forward with the hiring of 500 new police officers, first reported by WNYC, strikes some budget analysts as confusing. The expansion is quite a large one. Right now, the MTA employs 783 police officers.\n\n\u201cAdding spending to something that\u2019s already in the hole makes it worse,\u201d said Andrew Rein, the president of the Citizens Budget Commission.\n\nThe MTA has yet to announce how much its police hiring spree will cost.\n\nAccording to Ken Girardin, a labor analyst at the right-leaning Empire Center for Public Policy, every new police officer will cost the MTA roughly $56,000, which means the new personnel would initially cost the MTA roughly $28 million a year.\n\nThose costs should rapidly increase over time, as police salaries rapidly increase.\n\n\"Within 7 years, the base pay hits $88,000,\u201d Girardin said.\n\nRein, of the Citizens Budget Commission, also predicted a big financial hit.\n\n\u201cOur best preliminary estimate is that an additional 500 officers over the [financial] plan would add cumulatively $200 million, which would add to the shortfall, bringing it closer to $1 billion over the four years.\u201d\n\nThe MTA plans to partially pay for the new police officers using the $40 million Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance promised the authority in June. The MTA argues that the new police officers, with their brief to combat fare evasion, could almost end up paying for themselves with the new fare revenue they bring in.\n\nThe MTA estimates it loses more than $200 million a year to fare evasion.\n\nThe authority's decision to increase the size of its police force comes as Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who effectively controls the MTA, focuses on what he calls \u201cquality of life\u201d concerns on the subway. By his definition, quality of life issues include increased homelessness, fare evasion, assaults on workers and aggressive panhandling.\n\n\u201cYou hear all the time, riders say, 'Doors opened, I went to go on the car, the smell was so terrible and there was garbage,'\" Cuomo said Tuesday. \"'A homeless person had left stuff in the car and I couldn't get in the car.' Those type of issues are increasing.\"\n\nTo budget watchdogs, however, it\u2019s not clear that the MTA has the financial capacity to take on the new burden.\n\nAs the comptroller\u2019s report noted Friday, \u201cThe MTA\u2019s latest financial plan shows budget gaps that grow from $392 million in 2020 to nearly $1.6 billion in 2023.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe subways are experiencing the highest on-time performance in more than six years and every other major key performance indicator shows year-over-year improvement,\u201d Minton said. \u201cWe are moving forward on multiple fronts to ensure a better environment for our customers.\u201d", "description": "DiNapoli\u2019s assessment of dire out-year budget deficits and staggering debt burdens echoes the MTA\u2019s own assessment of its financial situation.", "authors": ["Dana Rubinstein"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/e2/6f/51164b1646688e5f2e3b2e8e887a/180309-subway-mta-gty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
