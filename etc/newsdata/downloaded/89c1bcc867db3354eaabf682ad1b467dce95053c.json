Although, that still doesn\u2019t stop some pretty confused looks from old ladies in the park when they come up to us and ask if they\u2019re a boy or a girl. It can take a bit of explaining.\n\n\u201cWe are quite good now at holding space for people\u2019s discomfort in us going, \u2018oh well, actually we don\u2019t tell anyone, we\u2019re not telling anyone for now\u2019.\"\n\nHowever, the pair insisted important discussions had arisen as a result of their decision and described their experience as \u201ca really beautiful thing\u201d.\n\n\"It has had the effect we wanted, of letting our baby develop its own interests regardless of gender,\" Mr England-Johns said. \"So, for example, while they love having a doll\u2019s tea party every morning, they also are really fascinated by motorbikes and machinery.\"", "description": "A couple are raising their toddler without telling it what sex it is,\u00a0in a bid to \u201cmitigate the gender bias that society places on children\u201d.
