Manu Tuilagi, Joe Cokanasiga and the Vunipolas all swapped the South Pacific for a new family life in Europe, while Ruaridh McConnochie rattled around the lower leagues and the sevens circuit for years before his electric form for Bath caught the eye of Eddie Jones.\n\nNo one, though, has taken a more unusual route than Piers Francis, whose journey to Japan via Old Gravesendians, Maidstone, Auckland under-21s, Edinburgh, Doncaster, Counties Manukau, the Blues and Northampton should act as motivation for gap-year travellers everywhere. Not that long ago Francis was working in Starbucks in Auckland\u2019s busy Queen Street, playing a spot of club rugby between shifts. Any prospect of swapping flat whites for a white England World Cup jersey was a distinctly distant dream.\n\nMichael Cheika hints at 'horses-for-courses' selection policy at Rugby World Cup | Bret Harris Read more\n\nIf the 29-year-old has enjoyed the occasional slice of selectorial luck along the way \u2013 Jones might have plumped instead for the midfield qualities of the jettisoned Ben Te\u2019o, Alex Lozowski, Danny Cipriani, Brad Barritt or Ollie Devoto, among others \u2013 he deserves significant credit for making it happen. As a 17-year-old he was released by the Saracens academy \u2013 he was the same vintage as Jamie George \u2013 on the depressingly familiar grounds that, at the time, he was too small and skinny. Instead of diluting his ambition to be a professional player, however, the rejection made him more determined than ever. \u201cIt really fuelled the fire and cemented what I wanted to do, regardless of people\u2019s opinions,\u201d says Francis. \u201cI wanted to play professional rugby and I wanted to play for England.\u201d\n\nThus it was that he decided to leave Kent club rugby behind and try his gap-year luck in New Zealand. \u201cI\u2019d finished school and wasn\u2019t keen to go to university immediately. I knew in my head what I needed to do and that was to pursue rugby as best as I could. As far away as it seemed at the time, New Zealand were the No 1 team in the world and it seemed like the best place to go.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Francis during the training session at Pennyhill Park.

I played under-21s and the next year I made the first-grade team. Then I joined Auckland\u2019s academy and things went from there.\u201d When he was not training he was up to his elbows in coffee and frothy milk. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m a professional coffee maker but I\u2019ve done it. Back then the machines were proper ones, they\u2019re not the button machines they have now. I\u2019d train with the club on Tuesday and Thursday nights and play on Saturdays but I\u2019d also train with the academy at 5.30am, then go to work and train again in the evening.\u201d\n\nTyphoon leaves England stranded at airport amid World Cup travel chaos Read more\n\nIn the Auckland ITM Cup team at the time, coincidentally, were Gareth Anscombe and Hadleigh Parkes, both now based in Wales. \u201cIt\u2019s quite ironic \u2026 I was the No 10 behind Gareth for Auckland in 2011. I was really gutted about his injury last month. All of which begs the question: how exactly did a blow-in from Kent prosper in New Zealand where highly talented inside backs are hardly a rarity? The answer, in Francis\u2019s case, was simple: the chance to rub shoulders with players such as Rieko Ioane, Sonny Bill Williams and George Moala and learn from them gave him a self-belief he had never previously enjoyed. \u201cI always felt the top was so far away where I was in England. The top level seemed almost unattainable.\n\n\u201cAt Maidstone I wouldn\u2019t have had the chance to play with someone like Billy Vunipola and have a conversation with him. If you\u2019re in London South East 2 you don\u2019t get the exposure to the top guys. In New Zealand you get Super Rugby players and All Blacks who come back and play for their clubs. Being exposed to those guys made the gap seem closer. It really stimulated me. I was thinking: \u2018They\u2019re not the gal\u00e1cticos I thought they were.\u2019 It fuelled the fire to keep at it.\u201d\n\nPlaying Super Rugby developed the versatile skills and experience of southern hemisphere methods that, along with his appetite for hard work in the gym, clearly attracted Jones. Francis may not start the biggest World Cup fixtures but, either way, the management know they have a player who positively relishes a challenge. If he could offer young English hopefuls one piece of advice it is never, ever give up. \u201cHowever big things might seem at 16 years old don\u2019t let it go. Look where I am now.\u201d There is more than one way to the top if you want to ruck and maul badly enough.", "description": "An unusual gap year set Piers Francis on a path through the New Zealand rugby system and eventually a place in England\u2019s Rugby World Cup squad in Japan", "authors": ["Robert Kitson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc5789e0242d3564006fb689c2ae01259256fc11/0_0_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ff9e205e3f476c738476b78d85ea0aa4", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
