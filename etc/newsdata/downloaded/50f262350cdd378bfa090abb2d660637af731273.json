Olson teamed up with liberal lawyer David Boies \u2014 they were on opposite sides in Bush v. Gore \u2014 to challenge California\u2019s Proposition 8, which allowed only opposite-sex marriage.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut Olson, who represented President George W. Bush and then served as his solicitor general, remains mostly associated with the political right. President Trump twice tried to hire him as his personal attorney.\n\nThe Supreme Court on Nov. 12 is scheduled to consider Trump\u2019s plan to eliminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, began in 2012 by a proclamation by President Barack Obama after Congress failed to pass an immigration overhaul.\n\nDACA encouraged those who had been brought to the United States as children, and who met requirements for abiding by the law and length of time in the country, to apply for protection from deportation. The application is renewable, and about 700,000 people are covered by the program, which also allows them to apply for work authorization.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump has been inconsistent on the matter, alternately supportive of the \u201cdreamers\u201d and insistent that DACA is illegal. He has tweeted that the Supreme Court \u201cmust\u201d agree and shut down the program so that the executive and legislative branches can negotiate a path forward.\n\nOlson surprises conservative by trying to overturn gay-marriage ban\n\nThe Trump administration moved to scuttle the program in 2017 after Texas and other states threatened to sue to force its end. Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions advised the Department of Homeland Security that the program was probably unlawful and that, legally, it could not be defended.\n\nSessions based that decision on a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, which said that another Obama program protecting immigrants \u2014 for undocumented parents of children with legal status \u2014 was beyond the president\u2019s constitutional powers. The Supreme Court deadlocked 4 to 4 in 2016 when considering the issue.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut the legality of DACA has never been determined, and judges who have considered the Trump administration\u2019s actions to dissolve it say it is different. They said that DHS\u2019s justification for ending DACA must be based on more than just a belief about its legal underpinnings.\n\nThe courts have allowed those in the program to renew their applications while the legal battle continues.\n\nSolicitor General Noel J. Francisco, representing the administration, told the Supreme Court that the executive branch has the authority \u201cto revoke a discretionary policy of non-enforcement that is sanctioning an ongoing violation of federal immigration law by nearly 700,000 aliens.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOlson, whose law firm already was representing some individual DACA recipients, said he will argue that \u201cpeople have altered their lives\u201d because of DACA and that its revocation would actually be a new enforcement regime that must be accompanied by reasoning.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe executive can\u2019t just come out with a policy that affects 700,000 people and their employers and their families and their communities\u201d and then justify it simply by saying \u201cbecause we want to do it,\u201d Olson said.\n\nOlson will be representing individuals in the program and others such as universities, California regents, unions and cities and counties. He has asked the court for expanded briefing time, which would be split with California Solicitor General Michael Mongan, who would represent states that want the program to remain in place.\n\nOlson laughed when asked whether he would still be considered \u201cconservative\u201d after his latest cause.\n\nDACA recipients, he said, have \u201cbeen Americans all their lives, for all intents and purposes. And we\u2019re going to put them in peril, deprive them of the security the rest of us have? That doesn\u2019t seem to me a position that conservatives would want to be espousing.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The Republican former solicitor general will argue that the Trump administration cannot arbitrarily end DACA.", "authors": ["Robert Barnes", "Reporter Covering The U.S. Supreme Court"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/SiYCJIS4WfrPQOEfB5My3TCdOJg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BXBB4SXAPYI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
