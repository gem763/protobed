We relied on celebrities and TV stars, and well-known influencers from America.\n\n\"We had started getting noticed by the press, and were featured in well-read magazines, like Elle.\u201d\n\nThe firm also tapped into the power of social media, building up a community of around 50,000 followers who Stephanie said \u201cappreciated what we stood for\u201d and helped get the word out there about the jewellery line.\n\nShe added: \u201cWe have a lot to thank them for - they have stayed loyal to us throughout and kept us going during the hard times.\u201d\n\nOn track\n\nThings look rather different today, with the jewellery range now available from a host of well known outlets.\n\nThese include the likes of Asos Marketplace and SilkFred, while the items are also sold by plenty of independent stores, not just in the UK but overseas as well.\n\nStephanie said that while there are still hard times that come with running the business, such as on cash flow, the couple are \u201ccertainly on track\u201d, with turnover forecast at more than \u00a31million for next year.\n\n\u201cIt has been disgustingly hard getting here - it has quite literally taken blood, sweat and tears. Even when I was diagnosed with breast cancer last year, we kept it together and we never let go of our dream of making something of this.\n\n\"Thankfully, I am better now and I know nothing can stop us because, above everything, we've got passion that keeps us going.\n\nAs for would-be entrepreneurs who want to follow their own dreams, Stephanie argued that it is better to act now, and think later.\n\n\u201cThe mind is very powerful and we can talk ourselves out of the best ideas. Don't think too much about the obstacles because it will feel overwhelming and you won't even start.\n\n\"Just take that first leap of faith and you will find a way as long as you have passion in your idea. When the chips are down and you feel like quitting, passion will keep you going.\u201d", "description": "The I Am range from Soul Analyse has gone on to win fans across the world including Gok Wan and Rebekah Vardy - but it was a massive risk when new mum Stephanie Dunleavy and her husband launched it", "authors": ["John Fitzsimons"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/money/article20647277.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_IAm-main.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
