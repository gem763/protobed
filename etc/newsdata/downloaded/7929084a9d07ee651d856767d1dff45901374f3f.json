Indications are for slowdown, not recession. An October Fed rate cut is quite likely. 2-yr T-Note at 1.4% shows where the fed funds are headed and that means more cuts ahead. The Fed will try to keep this expansion going as long as it can.\n\nWall Street optimism seems to be inversely proportional to the prospects of presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren. In polls for Democratic nomination, Warren and Biden are tied but in real-time betting markets, Warren leads Biden 50% vs 25%. Sanders\u2019 heart issues hurt his chances and Warren was the huge beneficiary leading to the big market selloff on Wednesday. David Rosenberg [ Gluskin Sheff ] now includes in the top of his worry list Warren presidency and the Senate flipping over to Democrats. The impeachment inquiry for President Trump may negatively affect his reelection chances and also reduce the prospects of legislative progress on President\u2019s agenda. Stephanie Pomboy [ MacroMavens ] worries that corporate taxes may go up as some expiring tax cuts may not be renewed by the Congress.\n\nPg 11, Streetwise: Q3 earnings won\u2019t be pretty with -4.1% y-o-y expected. But actual earnings may beat low expectations and could be flat. High-drama earnings will be from NFLX, MAT, HAS, T, GPS, GOOGL.\n\nPg 14-15: Fed Chair Powell\u2019s speech in Denver on Tuesday. FOMC Minutes on Wednesday.\n\nDuring a year filled with high drama, the GE CEO Culp kept his focus on debt reduction, balance sheet, operations.\n\nDelta [DAL; yield 3%; fwd P/E 7.3] is attractive. Its Q3 will be good in absolute terms but the stock sold off on lowered Q3 guidance. It doesn\u2019t have any Boeing 737 MAX in its fleet. It made a big investment in Chilean Latam Airlines .\n\nData this week: Consumer credit on Monday; PPI, small business optimism index on Tuesday; JOLTS report, wholesale trade on Wednesday; CPI, initial jobless claims on Thursday; consumer sentiment on Friday.\n\nBullish Recommendations: United Technology + Raytheon merger [UTX (fwd P/E 16.3) + RTN (fwd P/E 16.7), both cheap; shareholder vote is Oct 11; combo will be owned 53% by UTX shareholders, 43% by RTN shareholders; combo net debt/cash flow < 2; UTX to spinoff Carrier (air-conditioning/heating) and Otis (elevators/escalators) before the merger closes; to play, (i) buy UTX, or (ii) buy UTX and short RTN; pg 17];\n\nTaiwan Semi [TSM; yield 3.4%; fwd P/E 19; market share 50% by revenue, 80-90% by profit; leads in 7 nm chips (INTC will have them in 2021); will have 5 nm chips in 2020; US-China trade war helps TSM as it is a major supplier to Huawei ; pg 27].\n\nBearish Recommendations: Music streaming service Spotify [SPOT; losses; 3-6 months of free service are costly; move into podcasting hasn\u2019t paid off; short interest 5%+; competition from AMZN, AAPL, GOOGL; pg 16].\n\nPg 18: Cover Story, \u201cWho Will Win the New Broker Wars?\u201d Several major brokers [SCHW, ETFC, IBKR, AMTD, etc] dropped equity trading commissions to zero \u2013 Fidelity and Vanguard were the holdouts for now. These are tough times for brokers. We may be at the tail end of this long bull market and low rates adversely affect margins on cash. Competition is intense. Industry may consolidate and there may be job cuts. Lite/retail-trading systems will be commission-free [but the brokers get compensated by payments for order flows] and pro/institutional-trading systems [with better executions] will have commissions.\n\nThe winner may be SCHW, a disruptor. It also has diverse business lines. More than 50% of its revenue is from net interest income. It has $3.7 trillion in client AUM and that includes $1.55 trillion via RIAs, the largest in industry. It is #2 in robo-advising. Schwab Bank [2003- ] has $276 billion in assets and it is now bigger than KEY, FITB, etc; it will be subjected to stiffer stress-tests the next time. Schwab funds its Bank via cash from brokerages and robo-advisors.\n\nPg 24: Commission-free equity trading has arrived, but look at the fine print or catches. There will likely be commissions for options, fixed-income, OTC/pink-sheet stocks, foreign stocks, etc. Commissions may also apply to assisted trading, institutional trading, etc. Fees may apply to wire transfers. Brokers may make up for lost revenue by paying little on brokerage cash [only a few now offer money-market funds as core/settlement accounts (Fidelity, Vanguard)], spread on margin loans, payments for order flows, etc.\n\nPg 28: Shipping fuel used now is very dirty [low-grade with high sulfur (3.5%) content]. That will change on 1/1/20 when the new IMO 2020 Rules on cleaner marine fuel [high-grade with low sulfur (0.5%) content] go into effect, or ships have to install scrubbers to lower emissions if they continue to use dirty fuel. This will shift marine fuel demand from cheaper dirty fuel to more expensive cleaner fuel. Beneficiaries will be refiners [VLO, MPC], shipping/transport/storage companies [FRO, STNG, TNK, GOGL, SBLK, DHT, PBFX], midstream companies [EPD, MMP]. The US crude exports will rise too as the US crude is light/sweet and can be easily refined into high-grade, low sulfur marine fuel.\n\nPg 29: Almost $1.2 billion in 100-yr munis at attractive %coupon/%yield [YTM] have been offered this year by Georgetown U [5.22%/3.65%], U Pennsylvania [3.61%/3.21%], U Virginia [3.23%/3.21%], Rutgers U [3.92%/3.87%]. Older century-munis from other universities, hospitals and municipalities also exist. Yields of century-munis are better than BBB-corporates. However, many university and hospital bonds are only exempt from state tax, but not from federal tax.\n\nPg 30: Chinese could be the winner in 5G race. Chinese local governments are subsidizing the rollout of 5G. Huawei is a leader in 5G but it is banned in the US; however, one can play with Taiwanese TSM that is a supplier to Huawei . There is skepticism in the US about the marketing of 5G services and 5G phones will be slow to arrive. Enterprise applications and IoT [Internet of Things] will be early beneficiaries of 5G.\n\nExtras from Friday \u2013 I try to guess on Friday which features will make it in the weekend edition but the following guesses didn\u2019t make it. Almost 75-80% of the weekend edition is now available by 9:00 PM Central on Friday. Barron\u2019s revised website has \u201cInterests\u201d tabs similar to columns topics and that makes it easier to find potential items for the weekend edition. This is also the reason for earlier postings on Saturday \u2013 I do wait for my paper delivery [typically between 5:00-6:30 AM Central] to fill in some data.\n\nBearish Recommendations: HP [HPQ; announced locked (must use HP ink-cartridges) and unlocked models (may use non-HP ink-cartridges) for its printers that would hurt profitability; announced huge job cuts; increased dividends; increased buybacks];\n\nAvnet [AVT; lost distribution relationship with TXN].\n\nJobs report below expectations and weak economic data has made Oct Fed rate cut likely. The wage growth may have peaked.\n\nYBB", "description": "Pg 8, Up & Down Wall Street: Unemployment rate fell to 3.5%, a 50-yr low, and it counteracted weak ISM manufacturing [below 50; contraction] and - 25504", "authors": ["Contributor", "Participant", "Explorer"], "top_image": "https://zwcdr85544.i.lithium.com/html/assets/favicon.ico?15D4DC4041FDD3CD56F6121736C9C68D", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
