such as a delay of over a decade in bringing in the new bowel cancer test - end up costing lives.\n\nThe study found people would be more likely to accept invitations for screening if appointments were available either near their home or workplace - at convenient times.\n\nSome women also prefer to be screened at sexual health clinics, it said.\n\n(Image: PA Wire/Press Association Images)\n\nThe document noted GPs must be \"incentivised\" to provide convenient appointments and ensure people take up screening.\n\nText message reminders could also be sent to increase uptake of appointments, although current IT systems hinder access to mobile phone numbers.\n\nMore should also be made of social media campaigns to raise awareness of the importance of screening, the report said.\n\nThe study also said trans people and gender diverse populations are \"currently poorly served by screening services\" and this must be improved.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nIt said: \"Transmen may have a cervix and thus be at risk of cervical cancer.\n\n\"However, their gender may be recorded as male and thus they would not be routinely called for cervical screening.\n\n\"Transwomen are at an increased risk of breast cancer compared to cisgender men if using hormones, but are only invited for screening if registered as female.\"\n\nThe report welcomed the Government's new funding to replace MRI machines, CT scanners and breast screening equipment, saying some equipment was hugely outdated.\n\nIt noted that some mobile vans for breast screening were \"at least 17 years old\" with \"leaking roofs\".\n\nAnd while most patients get the results of their screening on time, just 23.2% of women received their cervical screening results within the recommended two weeks in April 2019 due to a changeover to a new system.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe report said the current screening service saves over 10,000 lives a year but there is a sense \"that we are now slipping\" and each screening service could \"do better\".\n\nIt was also unclear who is accountable for the screening service - with Public Health England (PHE) and NHS England both having key roles - and the report said responsibility must be transferred to NHS England.\n\n\"The current system lacks clear leadership and accountability,\" the report said.\n\n\"The rationale for dividing responsibilities across PHE and NHSE is often unclear and creates confusion, delays and risks to patient safety.\"\n\nOn IT, the study said the current systems used for screening \"are woefully out of date and long due for replacement\", leading \"to inefficiencies and errors\".\n\nIt added: \"Some of the systems - particularly those for breast and cervical screening - are old and liable to fail.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nSir Mike welcomed the work being done by bodies including NHSX to upgrade the systems, adding that this process must continue.\n\nThe report said: \"A modern IT system should enable patients to make or change their own appointments for screening, to be able to access information on their own screening records and to see when their various screenings are next due.\n\n\"None of these functions are currently available.\"\n\nSimon Stevens, NHS chief executive, welcomed the report and said the recommendations were \"sensible\", while Health Secretary Matt Hancock accepted that NHS England would take on overall responsibility for screening.\n\nSara Hiom, Cancer Research UK's director of early diagnosis, said: \"Thousands of premature deaths are avoided every year in the UK thanks to our cancer screening programmes, but there are still many things holding them back.\"\n\nShe said a \"lack of funding has led to an archaic NHS infrastructure - especially IT systems - making it virtually impossible to optimise our country's screening programmes.\"\n\nShe added: \"The Department of Health and Social Care must take urgent action to ensure the review's recommendations are implemented so that no lives are needlessly lost to cancer.\"\n\nRobert Music, chief executive of Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust, said there needed to be \"quick and decisive action as a result of the recommendations\".\n\n\n\n", "description": "A new report recommends rewarding NHS GPs for offering women cancer screening appointments at convenient times", "authors": ["Matthew Dresch", "Image", "Getty Images", "Getty Images Cultura Rf", "Pa Wire Press Association Images", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20588418.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Solving-womens-health-issues.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
