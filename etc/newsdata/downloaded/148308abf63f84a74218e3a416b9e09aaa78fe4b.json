We feel he will be a great resource for our hockey staff and our prospects.\u201d\n\nOrpik announced his retirement in June after a 16-year NHL career as a blueliner for the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Capitals. He played in 1,035 regular season games and 156 postseason games, and he won a Stanley Cup with both Pittsburgh and Washington.\n\nEven the week he retired, Orpik was still spending time around the Capitals\u2019 practice facility, meeting and giving advice to the young prospects there for Washington\u2019s annual development camp.\n\nJust a few months later, Orpik is back with the team to continue doing what those who know him say he does best.\n\n\u201cThe thing with Brooks Orpik is I don\u2019t have to ask him to talk to anybody. He just does it and that\u2019s who he is,\u201d coach Todd Reirden said in June. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him in more conversations, whether it was last year, the year before, the 10 years I\u2019ve known him \u2014 he always has had the desire to grab, in particular, a young defenseman and talk to him.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
