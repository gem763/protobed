As with other polling, the survey, which ended just as news of the whistleblower complaint that sparked the Ukraine scandal was emerging, found Trump with a firm grasp on the Republican Party.\n\nHis support was particularly strong among Fox News viewers. Fifty-five percent of GOP respondents who cited Fox News as their primary source of news said there was nothing Trump could do to lose their approval. That was far greater than the 29% of other Republicans who said the same.\n\nAnother variable that showed divergence was education. Forty-five percent of Republicans without a college degree said there was virtually nothing Trump could do to lose their support, compared with 35% of college-educated Republicans.\n\nOverall, 62% of Americans surveyed said Trump's personal conduct and behavior made them less likely to support him, compared with 30% of voters who said his conduct made no difference to them. Eight percent said his conduct made them more likely to support him.\n\nNearly all Republican Fox News viewers opposed a Trump impeachment\n\nTrump Zelensky More\n\nJonathan Ernst/Reuters\n\nThe PRRI poll also highlighted that 98% of Republicans who said Fox News was their primary source of news thought Trump should not be impeached and removed from office. That finding was similar, however, to Republicans overall, of whom 94% opposed Trump's impeachment and removal.\n\nIn contrast, the poll found that 78% of Democrats thought Trump should be impeached and removed from office.\n\nThough impeachment was only a small part of the PPRI survey, the subject has since dominated the national conversation in the US since the unveiling of a whistleblower complaint that centered on a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nThe intelligence official who lodged the complaint detailed concerns that Trump had pressured Ukraine to aid Trump politically by investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter on allegations of corruption. The complaint was declassified last month, and the White House released a memo summarizing the call that corroborated the complaint.\n\nRead more: The White House is drafting an executive order to take on 'conservative bias' on social media platforms\n\nA second whistleblower has since come forward with firsthand knowledge of some of the allegations outlined in the original whistleblower complaint.\n\nFox News connection to the Trump administration\n\nHeather Nauert More", "description": "In a poll before the Ukraine scandal, 98% of Republicans who said Fox News was their main news source said Trump shouldn't be impeachment and removed.", "authors": ["Rosie Perper"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0jV.tnj9r9EdZO4ctc9UDQ--~B/aD0xMDAwO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/743d033be6828003f2329b7a2ccb5c3d", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
