In its financial release, Shopify said it's seeing strong interest from merchants as it continues to add partners and optimize the network.\n\n\"Our strong results in the quarter were driven in part by the success of our international expansion, which is just one of the many ways we are investing in the platform,\" said Shopify CFO Amy Shapero, in a statement. \"By carefully balancing these multiple opportunities that have different investment time horizons, we can keep investing in the innovations that will power merchants in the future while helping them grow rapidly today.\"\n\nIn terms of outlook, Shopify projected fourth quarter revenue of $472 million to $482 million and 2019 sales of $1.54 billion to $1.55 billion, up slightly from its previous range of $1.51 billion to $1.53 billion.
