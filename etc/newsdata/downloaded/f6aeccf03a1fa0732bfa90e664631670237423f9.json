Schiff said that Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire was illegally withholding a whistle-blower\u2019s complaint from Congress. Schiff implied, but did not come out and say, that the complaint implicated President Trump.\n\nIn the days since, more details have trickled out, and last night the Washington Post added an explosive new detail: The complaint is about President Trump\u2019s communications with a foreign leader. Specifically, \u201cTrump\u2019s interaction with the foreign leader included a \u2018promise\u2019 that was regarded as so troubling\u201d that a member of the Intelligence Community filed the complaint. NBC has confirmed this. The New York Times elaborates that the complaint was not limited to the offer made in a single call, but also includes \u201cmultiple acts\u201d by the President.\n\nThere are two main elements to this story. There\u2019s the crime (Trump made a shady promise to a foreign leader) and there\u2019s the cover-up (somebody found out about it, tried to alert Congress, but is being blocked by the director of National Intelligence).\n\nBegin with the crime. The Post does not say which foreign leader was the recipient of Trump\u2019s extraordinary and troubling offer. The lead suspect is obviously Vladimir Putin. In fact, he and Trump were reported to have had a phone call on July 31, less than two weeks before the whistle-blower filed the complaint. There is plenty of circumstantial evidence pointing this way. The call was publicly described as a discussion of \u201cwildfires in Siberia and trade,\u201d and according to the Kremlin, \u201cthe U.S. president offered Russia cooperation in fighting forest fires in Siberia.\u201d\n\nWhy would Trump call Putin about wildfires in Siberia? What help could he offer? Stranger things have happened, but even at the time, this explanation sounded odd. Trump has previously given sensitive intelligence to the Russians and taken extraordinary steps to conceal his conversations with Putin from American officials. What\u2019s more, the House is still investigating Trump and Russia, and Schiff says the director of National Intelligence is not able to verify that the complaint is unrelated to current investigations.\n\nStill, it\u2019s far from clear that Putin is the counterparty to Trump\u2019s offer. The president has had some corrupt or downright weird dealings with plenty of foreign leaders. Trump is personally getting paid by the Gulf kingdoms (how much we don\u2019t know). He has publicly stated that he wouldn\u2019t spy on North Korea, a dangerous adversary about which the U.S. desperately needs to collect intelligence. The possibilities for what this offer concerned are truly endless.\n\nWhat we know from the reporting so far is that the underlying matter is quite serious. Michael Atkinson, the Intelligence Community\u2019s inspector general, determined that the complaint was a matter of \u201curgent concern.\u201d (Atkinson is a Trump appointee.) This should have automatically invoked a legal requirement that Congress be notified. Instead, the director of National Intelligence has sat on it.\n\nWhat happens next? The inspector general testified in a closed session of the House today. According to the New York Times, Atkinson refused to share any pertinent information with Congress in the hearing. And the acting director of National Intelligence testifies in public next Thursday.\n\nThe historic pattern is that Trump fights every assertion of congressional prerogative, however unambiguous. It also seems predictable that, however blatant the violation may be, Republicans will find ways to justify it: He was joking. The president has the right to make any offers he wants. What about some of the bad things Fox News says Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama did?\n\nSo in short order this story is likely to become another bare partisan fight. How this plays out remains to be seen. Will the director of National Intelligence go along with Trump indefinitely, or follow the law? If it goes to court, will judges speed along the resolution, or let Trump drag it out past the election? And if the cover-up holds, will the allegation wind up leaking?\n\nTrump responds to the new reporting, combining his customary dismissal of \u201cfake news\u201d with a novel insistence that of course he would never make shady deals over the phone, because he knows the Feds might be listening:\n\n....Knowing all of this, is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially \u201cheavily populated\u201d call. I would only do what is right anyway, and only do good for the USA! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 19, 2019\n\nSo since there\u2019s nothing incriminating on the call, Trump should authorize the release of the report to Congress and clear his good name, right? Yeah, that\u2019s probably what will happen.\n\nOf course, Trump\u2019s claim that he would never \u201csay something inappropriate with a foreign leader\u201d on the phone is easy to refute. On a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian president, Trump \u201callegedly told the Ukrainian president to reopen the Biden investigation if he wanted to improve relations with the US.\u201d\n\nTelling a foreign leader to rough up your domestic opponent in exchange for good diplomatic relations is incredibly improper. Even Rudy Giuliani admitted it was improper. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing illegal about it,\u201d he told the Times in May. \u201cSomebody could say it\u2019s improper.\u201d We know Trump would say something improper to a foreign leader on the phone. Either he is dumb, or he\u2019s smart enough to understand his party will back him up regardless.\n\nThis post has been updated throughout.", "description": "The Washington Post reports that a member of the Intelligence Community learned of a troubling promise President Trump made to a foreign leader.
