REUTERS/Rebecca Cook\n\nThe announcement came just hours before the UAW\u2019s four-year contract with GM was to expire and capped a dramatic week for the union in which a top official was charged with embezzlement and its president was implicated in an ongoing federal corruption probe.\n\n\u201cWe still have many outstanding issues remaining, including significant differences (with GM)... on wages, health care benefits, temporary employees, job security and profit sharing,\u201d Terry Dittes, the UAW vice president who handles relations with GM, wrote in a letter to union officials.\n\nDittes said talks would continue right up until the collective bargaining agreement expires at midnight.\n\nGM responded in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe continue to work hard on solutions to some very difficult challenges,\u201d GM said. \u201cWe are prepared to negotiate around the clock.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, the UAW announced temporary contract extensions with Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) (FCHA.MI) (FCAU.N) while it focused its attention on GM. The union had targeted GM as the first automaker with which it wanted to conclude contract talks.\n\nThis year\u2019s talks had been expected to be contentious, but have been complicated by recent developments in a longstanding federal investigation into corruption at the union. The probe has raised questions about UAW President Gary Jones, who was identified as an unnamed official mentioned in a searing federal complaint this week detailing alleged embezzlement by union leaders.\n\nOn Friday, the union\u2019s executive board met but no changes were made to leadership, a union spokesman said.\n\nThe spreading probe raises fresh questions about the union\u2019s options and its leaders\u2019 standing with rank-and-file members. Last month, more than 96% of GM\u2019s hourly workers voted to authorize a strike if necessary, meaning if no deal is reached Jones could call for a walkout without further approval.\n\nGM\u2019s workers last went out on a brief two-day strike in 2007 during contract talks. A more painful strike occurred in Flint, Michigan, in 1998, lasting 54 days and costing the No. 1 U.S. automaker more than $2 billion.\n\nBut the recent strike authorization vote was held before the dramatic events of the last few weeks, which included a late August FBI raid on Jones\u2019 home and other locations as part of the corruption probe.\n\nSources briefed on the matter this week said GM may seek a temporary extension of the contract and pursue other options including seeking assistance from a third party.", "description": "The United Auto Workers (UAW) said late on Saturday it would not extend its contract with General Motors Co and would decide on a course of action at a meeting of union leaders in Detroit Sunday morning that could result in talks resuming or possibly workers going out on strike.", "authors": ["Nick Carey", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190915&t=2&i=1429941479&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8E002", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
