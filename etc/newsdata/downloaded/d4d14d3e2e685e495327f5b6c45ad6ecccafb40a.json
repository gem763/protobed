Another employee captured on video complains that CNN does not live up to its \"facts first\" slogan, while a third lamented that the network wants to focus its coverage mainly on Trump and the ongoing House impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cThe aforementioned examples are merely the tip of the iceberg of the evidence my clients have accumulated over recent years,\" Harder wrote. \"We also expect substantial additional information about CNN\u2019s wrongful practices to become known in the coming days and weeks.\"\n\nHarder alleged that CNN\u2019s actions constituted a violation of the Lanham Act, a law enacted in the 1940s that governs trademark use and false advertising.\n\nCNN dismissed the lawsuit in a statement on Friday.\n\n\"This is nothing more than a desperate PR stunt and doesn't merit a response,\" Matt Dornic, a spokesman for CNN, said in a statement.\n\nTrump, with Harder as his attorney, has threatened in the past to sue news outlets as well as multiple women who accused him of sexual misconduct, but so far he has not followed through with the threatened litigation.\n\nA case against CNN would likely face significant hurdles on First Amendment grounds.\n\nProject Veritas often records surreptitious videos and edits them in an effort to highlight allegations of liberal bias. The CNN videos were picked by conservative media this week, and appeared to be referenced in a tweet from Trump suggesting Zucker should resign.\n\nThe president routinely chastises CNN as \"fake news,\" targeting specific anchors and reporters and complaining about coverage he dislikes. His supporters often chant \"CNN sucks\" during campaign rallies.", "description": "An attorney representing President Trump's reelection campaign sent a letter to CNN on Friday threatening to sue the network over purported allegations of bias against the president.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/cnn_062717getty_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
