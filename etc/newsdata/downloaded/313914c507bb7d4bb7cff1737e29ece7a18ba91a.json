It\u2019s harder to get more direct than that.\u201d\n\nTrump has been on the defensive since his abrupt decision announced last week to withdraw forces from northeastern Syria where they had been supporting Kurdish forces fighting Islamic State and deterring any Turkish move into the area.\n\nAnkara says the Kurds that had been backed by the United States are terrorists linked to Kurdish separatists inside Turkey, and has vowed to press on with its assault regardless of any sanctions.\n\nU.S. lawmakers, including Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans, have been fiercely critical of what they see as the president\u2019s hasty handling of the situation following Trump\u2019s phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday.\n\nTrump on Wednesday said he did not give Erdogan a \u201cgreen light\u201d to push into northeastern Syria. The Turkish leader had long been planning such a move, Trump said, adding that he did not want U.S. forces in harm\u2019s way.\n\nEuropean allies have also criticized the move and called on Turkey to halt its operations.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump speaks with ABC TV reporter Jonathan Karl during a joint news conference with Italy's President Sergio Mattarella in the East Room of the White House in Washington, U.S., October 16, 2019.
