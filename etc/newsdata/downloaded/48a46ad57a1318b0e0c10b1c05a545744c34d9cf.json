British leaders, including Johnson, had until now upheld the 2015 accord between six major powers and Iran as a major diplomatic achievement.\n\nBritish officials insisted that the prime minister continued to support full compliance with that deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Programme of Action (JCPOA).\n\nHowever, Johnson had clearly come to the UN determined to emphasise his personal relationship with Trump, who reneged on the JCPOA last year, praising him highly in the interview.\n\nAsked about the JCPOA, Johnson said: \u201cThe reality is, as President Trump rightly said, it was a bad deal. It had many defects. Iran was and is behaving disruptively in the region.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it was a bad deal \u2013 and I\u2019m willing to accept that, it had many, many defects \u2013 then let\u2019s do a better deal.\n\n\u201cAnd I think there\u2019s one guy who can do a better deal and one guy who understands how to get a difficult partner like Iran over the line and that is the president of the United States.\u201d\n\nJohnson described Trump as a \u201cvery, very brilliant negotiator\u201d who could produce a \u201cTrump deal\u201d.\n\nOn the prospect of a US military response to the attacks, Johnson replied: \u201cIt\u2019s not something that I think will necessarily help the situation.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s remarks came as the UK, France and Germany declared they were convinced that Iran was responsible for airstrikes against Saudi oil installations on 14 September and called on Iran to negotiate over its role in the Middle East and its development of missiles as well as its nuclear programme.\n\nIn a joint statement at the UN general assembly on Monday, the three European governments supported the US and Saudi claim that Iran had carried out the missile and drone attack on 14 September against an oil field and petrochemical processing facility, but added they maintained support for the JCPOA.\n\n\u201cIt is clear to us that Iran bears responsibility for this attack. There is no other plausible explanation. We support ongoing investigations to establish further details,\u201d the statement said following a meeting between Johnson, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron.\n\nThe statement said that the attack raised the risk of a major new conflict, which was of concern to the whole world. It underlined the importance of collective security and multilateral action.\n\nThe statement also restated the European nations\u2019 commitment to the 2015 nuclear deal.\n\nAsked whether Johnson\u2019s undertaking in the European statement clashed with his remarks on the US evening news, a UK official insisted there was a coherent message.\n\n\u201cWhat this is about is achieving compliance, and we\u2019re open to various ways of achieving that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOur commitment is to working with all of our partners to find solutions to bring Iran into compliance. In his interview I think he was clear he wants to work with all our partners.\u201d\n\nThe European agreement called for Iran to return to the limits on its nuclear programme imposed by that agreement, which Tehran has begun to ignore more than a year after the US withdrew from the deal.\n\nBut the statement said Iran would now have to go further, arguing \u201cthe time has come for Iran to accept a long-term negotiation framework for its nuclear program, as well as regional security issues, which include its missile programs,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIran has denied responsibility, insisting the strikes were launched from Yemen by their Houthi allies.\n\nOn Monday night Iran ruled out the possibility of negotiating a new deal with major powers. Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said in a tweet that European partners have failed to fulfil their commitments under a 2015 nuclear pact.\n\nHow did oil attack breach Saudi defences and what will happen next?

Iran has said it will not necessarily accept the results of that report, calling into question the impartiality of the UN team.\n\nThe European statement comes as the US and Iran are poised to clash at the UN general assembly. Donald Trump is due to address the assembly on Tuesday, and the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, who has already arrived in New York, will speak the next day. Both are expected to blame the other for the worsening instability in the Gulf.", "description": "PM says president could come up with better pact, in apparent shift from European position", "authors": ["Peter Walker", "Julian Borger", "Kevin Rawlinson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba9fc36cd57dc80313620875a9e7ebaacffa6c67/0_8_2438_1463/master/2438.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7113af2445437f2ab6ad024a55cb1a46", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
