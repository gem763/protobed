The government slashed the domestic corporate tax by almost -10% from 34.94% to 25.17% on an average quite unexpectedly. The new corporate tax structure is effective from April 1, 2019, and any excess tax already paid as an advance would be adjusted with subsequent return/payment.\n\nAfter the Indian economy grew only 5% in Q1FY20 (vs 8% in Q1FY19 and 5.8% in Q4FY19), coupled with another report that unemployment rate at almost 50-years high, there is a huge hue & cry in media for the economic slowdown amid visible stress in almost all sectors of the economy including automobiles to FMCG and consumer goods. As an import oriented/domestic consumption economy, India\u2019s economic slowdown could be related to more domestic stories than Trump trade war. The Indian slowdown may be related to DEMO (unaccounted money-wealth destruction), chaotic GST system, decades of high borrowing costs and high tax.\n\nIn ANY WAY, The government was clearly under huge public and media pressure and began to roll out various small regulatory reforms and also some small fiscal stimulus, especially for the ailing automobiles and real estate sectors. But those were too little and too late. The Indian government was also under immense pressure for the last few years from angel investors (FPI/FII/DII), especially from big U.S. corporates to reduce corporate tax to average Asian/global levels.\n\nAngel investors do expect such big fiscal stimulus of tax cuts from Modi after Trump\u2019s tax cut reform (fiscal stimulus) back home in the U.S. The corporate tax cut was already in the pipeline for long. In the FY16 budget, the Modi Government under FM Jaitley had promised it to cut progressively to 25% over the next 5 years without the benefit of some deductions (simplification/reform of taxes). But nothing has happened as there was not much room for fiscal space and rating agencies could cut Indian rating for significant fiscal deficit breach.\n\nIn August\u201919, Modi government appointed a committee on direct tax reforms, which has suggested a number of measures to overhaul (simplification/deregulation-few slabs and exemption) India\u2019s 60-years old income tax regime (1961) and the corporate tax reform announced by the Indian government/FM also includes various recommendations by that tax committee.\n\nAngel investors were expecting that the Indian government will at least unveil the corporate tax cut proposal or give some roadmap in the 1st full-budget of Modi-II. But due to limited fiscal space, the government was unable to do much in this regard. But the present economic slowdown and huge public/media pressure may have compelled the government to act now rather than later without fearing for the fiscal deficit breach.\n\nEventually, the Indian FM Sitharaman unveiled quite unexpectedly a huge tax stimulus package of INR 1.45T/year (~$20.5B/year), just a day ahead of PM Modi\u2019s U.S. visit, where both Modi and Trump will address around 50K Indian NRIs in Houston (Howdy Modi). Basically, Modi is trying to help his \u2018best friend\u2019 Trump in the forthcoming 2020 U.S. election to get supports of the Indian community-\u2018AAb ki baar Trump sarkar\u2019. The Indian PM Modi will also discuss further FDI opportunities with big U.S. corporates such as JPM, Lockheed Martin, Mastercard, and Walmart.\n\nThe fiscal stimulus of $20.5B (INR 1.45T) is partly funded by India\u2019s central bank\u2019 (RBI) generous pay-out of more than $24B (INR 1.76T) towards the \u2018contribution of the development of the country\u2019. But despite such generous contribution by RBI, the Indian fiscal deficit could soar to +3.8 to +4.0% in FY20 against government\u2019s budget estimate (target) of +3.3%. The worry is that, in next year (FY21), the RBI may not be in a position to provide such generous dividend.\n\nAs a pointer, out of Rs.1.76T RBI \u2018bonanza\u2019, Rs.1.23T was surplus/dividend to the central government for FY19 (RBI---July to June), while Rs.0.53T was on account of excess provisions as recommended by the Jalan Committee on Economic Capital Framework (ECF). Out of Rs.1.76T, the government has already budgeted Rs.1.18T from RBI dividends (including the interim dividend of Rs.0.28T). Thus the government has now Rs.0.58T from RBI to fund partially the corporate tax cut stimulus of Rs.1.45T, leaving around Rs.0.87T as additional fiscal deficit.\n\nAs per some estimate, after calculating for the expected tax revenue shortfall, the decline in nominal GDP growth, expenditure rationalization initiatives, and RBI surplus, the net impact on the fiscal deficit will be Rs 0.82T or 0.4% of GDP.\n\nAlthough, as per FRBM rule, the Indian government can breach up to +0.50% for such fiscal deficit target, the reaction of the global rating agency (S&P, Fitch and Moody\u2019s) is vital, whether such fiscal breach would invite any rating action or not. But it seems that the Indian government is now no-longer \u2018begging\u2019 those global rating agencies for rating up-gradation after years of futile attempts and also does not care about any serious rating implications and so the market.\n\nGlobal rating agencies are divided over India\u2019s corporate tax cut stimulus; S&P negative, while Moody\u2019s positive:\n\nOn Friday, S&P said: \u201cIndia\u2019s move to cut corporate tax rates was a credit negative development, despite potentially boosting the economy as it will widen its fiscal deficit. The cuts are likely to boost sentiment and support the broader economy at a time when momentum is flagging.Nevertheless, we believe that the cuts will invariably lead to higher central and general government fiscal deficits, absent equivalent revenue-generating measures\u201d.\n\nMoody\u2019s said: \u201cIndia\u2019s move will boost the net income of companies and is credit positive.The extent of the final impact on credit profiles of Indian corporates will depend on whether they utilize the surplus earnings for reinvestment in the business, debt reduction or high shareholder returns\u201d.\n\nOn Sunday (22nd Sept), India\u2019s FM Sithnaraman said the government will not revise its fiscal deficit target immediately and is not planning any spending cuts at this stage. The government would only review the fiscal deficit target closer to the 2020/21 budget: \"At this point of time, we are not revising any target. The decision will be taken later. The government would decide on additional market borrowings for the second half of 2019/20 later\u201d.\n\nThere is limited additional fiscal space for the government. The government capex and spending is traditionally the main booster of the Indian economy. In India, government salary/pension (by both Federal and state) is now around 40% of the net revenue on an average, a major expense on the exchequer for the huge workforce.\n\nHighlights of the corporate tax cut: At a glance\n\nOn Friday, the Indian government has cut the corporate income tax rate from 30% to 22% for all companies and after the inclusion of all cess and surcharges the effective corporate tax rate in India now comes down to 25.17% from prior 34.94% for domestic incorporated companies. Thus there will be a benefit of a maximum of 9.77% for existing corporates, depending upon their tax profile.\n\nTo attract investment in manufacturing, domestic companies incorporated after on/after 1st October\u20192019 and starting operations before March 31, 2023 will pay tax at the basic rate of 15% (vs prior 25%) and the effective tax for new companies shall be 17.01%, including cess and surcharge (vs prior 29.12%). So there will be a benefit of a maximum of 12.11% for new corporates.\n\nThose companies enjoying tax holidays can avail concessional rates only after the exemption period. The corporate tax rates for domestic incorporated companies would be 22% if they do not avail themselves of any other exemption or concession; i.e. it\u2019s a dual tax system.\n\nThe minimum alternate tax (MAT) also reduced to 15% (effective rate around 17%) from 18.5% (effective rate around 22%) for companies continuing to avail exemptions and incentives. So, for MAT companies, the benefit would be around 5%.\n\nThe enhanced surcharge and STT announced in the budget to not apply to capital gains by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) and buyback tax on listed companies that had announced buybacks before July 5 exempted from taxation. The government has estimated the projected revenue loss for a reduction on corporate tax and other measures pegged at Rs 1.45T per year.\n\nIndia\u2019s current corporate tax rate for companies with over Rs.400 crore (INR 0.25B) turnover is officially 30%, but the effective tax rate (lowered by various concessions and exemptions) often ranges between 24% and 29% for most sectors. Thus the general relief maybe around 4%, but for some sectors like automobiles, private banks, capital goods, consumer staples, and oil & gas/energies, the relief is greater by around 10% as there were no concessions or exemptions for these sectors, while techs/IT, pharmaceuticals, utilities, and electrical companies may see little or no benefit.\n\nHow the corporate tax cut may affect Nifty-50 companies:\n\nAs per some estimates, out of 50-Nifty companies, almost 20 are now in a tax bracket higher than 25% and have the cumulative weight of around 40% in the index; i.e. for almost 60% of Nifty constituents (30 companies), the net effect is almost zero. Out of these 20-Nifty companies, the most beneficiaries are Bajaj Finance (9.40% tax benefit), Eicher Motors (9.15%), Britannia Ind (+8.93%), HDFC Bank (8.44%), Asian Paints (8.40%), Nestle India (to be included in Nifty-8.40%), ITC (7.40%), Hero Motor (6.90%), and Indusind Bank (6.90%), ACC (6.90%). Also, Kotak Bank, Bajaj Auto, and ONGC will be direct beneficiaries.\n\nThe government is targeting the relocation of some companies (supply line) from China amid Trump trade war:\n\nThe new corporate income tax rates in India is now almost at par with the lowest range in South East Asia, basically aimed at to take the present opportunities of supply chain relocation (Make in India) from China amid Trump trade war. In China the effective corporate tax rate is now at 25%, whereas in Bangladesh it\u2019s 25%, Indonesia 25%, South-Korea 25%, Thailand 20%, Vietnam 20%, Singapore 17%, Taiwan 17%, HK 16.5%, Philippines 30%, Mexico 30% and U.S. at 27.1%. Although India enjoys lower labor cost (in term of USD), the relocation may not be easy as there are factors of infrastructure, skill/quality, currency, and tariffs.\n\nAnd in any way, most of the U.S. MNCs, active in China are also not willing to relocate so early and become a victim of Trump\u2019s whims and fancies. As a pointer, trump is also now eyeing Vietnam as the next target of tariffs, where some companies have been relocated or already manufacturing for export to the U.S. on lower-cost benefits. But China is now also changing its strategy as labor cost has increased significantly in line with the overall economic growth. Thus, Chinese companies are now eyeing African countries as their next manufacturing base.\n\nLooking ahead, the government have to unveil further fiscal stimulus through GST and Personal tax reform to boost consumer spending:\n\nAlthough Friday\u2019s corporate tax cut is one of the boldest fiscal reform in Indian history and long overdue, it\u2019s very doubtful how it will stimulate the overall economy by boosting consumer spending. Indian corporates may use the higher profit for this tax cut to a higher payout for shareholders (higher dividend, buyback, and bonus shares) rather than higher (incremental) capex (for expansion) until there is a revival of demand and the need for capacity expansion. Companies could also go for debt reduction with this windfall tax gain.\n\nThe companies may not pass the tax cut benefits to their employees by higher wages. The present tax cuts are limited to corporates and not to individuals. Thus, Indian consumers may not get any direct benefits, although companies could reduce their product/service price to some extent for the tax benefit windfall gain. But, again that is very unlikely. So, unless and until Indian consumers get more disposable money in their hands, discretionary/consumer spending will not grow significantly. Thus, some cuts are also necessary for personal tax along with a thrust in employment.\n\nGST simplification/further reform is necessary:\n\nThe market was also expecting that along with corporate tax reforms, there will be further reform in personal tax, especially a cut for middle class/earners and rationalization of GST rates. There was a huge pressure on the government to reduce GST on automobiles from 28% to 18% and also for some other sectors.\n\nThe Indian GST system is perhaps the most complicated among G20 countries, having a very complex return filing system, having multiple slabs/rates (0%, 0.25%, 3%, 5%, 12%, 18%, and 28%-sin tax). Automobiles, cements-the two critical components of the economy are in sin tax of 28% category along with many consumer goods affecting consumer demand. Moreover, petroleum products, alcoholic drinks, and electricity are not taxed under GST and instead taxed by individual states/provinces separately as per old tax regime of much higher tax.\n\nAdditionally, there is a special rate of 0.25% on rough precious and semi-precious stones and 3% on gold. Further, there is a cess of 22% on top of 28% GST applies on a few items like aerated drinks, luxury cars, and tobacco products. In India, total tax component (Federal and State) on petrol and diesel is now around 75%, one of the highest in the world (against 25% in the U.S.). This is a legacy problem in India as a petroleum tax is an easy revenue source for both State and Federal governments.\n\nIn brief, India is a high-cost economy for decades-higher taxes, higher borrowing costs, devalued currency (higher imported inflation) and rampant corruption. But the Modi government is now taking steps like DEMO (partially succeeded to remove corruption), reducing corporate taxes, borrowing costs (RBI cut of -1.10% so far with more cuts of -0.40% may come).\n\nBut it now seems that the government is not willing to simplify the GST system to its true meaning (one nation-one tax) by clubbing all the seven tax slabs into one, say 18% with the simplification of return filling. India now needs minimum Rs.1T/month in GST collection, but the current run rate is lower and the GST deficit is increasing day-by-day as the economy is also slowing down.\n\nThere was a great hope that GST will add GDP growth by at least 1% alone, but that\u2019s not the case as the overall cost of the GST system is too high for both consumers and business, especially MSMEs. Thus the need of the hour is true GST reform to a single rate for all products and services and simplification of the return filing system, not mere recalibration.\n\nThe possible effect of the tax cut on Nifty-EPS:\n\nOn average, the Nifty EPS may be boosted by an additional around 5-8% additional for this 9.77% tax cut and gradual transmission of lower borrowing costs. Overall, Nifty EPS now could grow around 15% on an average from prior 7.5%. Midcaps and small caps EPS are now expected to grow around 20%. But there will be also a base effect factor from FY21 onwards.\n\nBefore-tax cut, at the current run rate, the projected EPS for Nifty was around 427 (FY19) and 455 (FY20) under normal circumstances, assuming an average growth (CAGR) of around 6.30%. But after Friday\u2019s corporate tax cut, the projected Nifty EPS maybe around 450 for FY-20 (assuming 5% additional boost on an average) and 500 for FY-21. And thus assuming an average PE between 20-25 (including Modi premium), the fair value of Nifty should be around 9000-11250 (FY19) and 10000-12500 (FY21).\n\nOn Thursday, there were some reports that the Indian FM Sitharaman could announce some stimulus measures that could include tariffs (import duty) rationalization. The Indian government was also urging States to slash GST on automobiles, travels & tourisms and also on some other sectors. The Indian government likely to use extra dividend offered by RBI to fund budgetary spending as the Indian government faces a shortfall in revenue could consider spending cut in the Jan-March quarter.\n\nOverall, in September, Nifty surged +2.29% (MTD), while it made a low of 10670.50 and made a 1-month high of 11381.15 on Friday. In fact, on Friday, before the announcement of corporate tax cut Nifty made a low of 10691.00. Nifty was undercut by higher USD, higher oil, muted fiscal stimulus (until the tax cut announcement) and hopes & hypes of a big-bang fiscal stimulus for the last few weeks.\n\nOn Friday, Indian 10Y Bond Yield jumped to a high of 6.874% from the session low of 6.552% after the tax cut announcement as it will cause higher fiscal deficits and higher government borrowings.\n\nSubsequently, USDINR also slumped on higher Indian bond yield, positive for INR; generally, fiscal stimulus is positive for the currency. Also, a booming stock market because of the fiscal stimulus is positive for currency inflow as FPIs will invest (higher demand of INR). But the concern of higher fiscal deficit may also drag a currency in due course. USDINR made a monthly high-low of around 72.41-70.68.\n\nIn any way, looking ahead RBI will cut by another -0.40% to bring the headline rate to 5.00% and may also tinker with CRR/SLR rate to infuse liquidity. The headline inflation (CPI is now around +3.21%, below RBI target, while core inflation at +4.25%, above RBI target of 4%; although RBI now recognizes headline CPI rather than core CPI.\n\nBut the problem would be bank\u2019s actual transmission, which is so far little (around -0.40% on an average against RBI cut of -1.10%). As Indian bond yield could be elevated in the coming days, banks could be more unwilling to pass the full benefit of RBI rate cuts to the ultimate borrowers. Although the tax cut could help their bottom line, banks are taking the excuses of the legacy issue of NPA/NPL. Thus banks/NBFC are not willing to sacrifice much of their nigh NIM (net interest margin), possibly one of the highest in G20. Banks are also citing still high savings rate of small savings deposit as one of the primary reasons, why they are not slashing their FD/deposit rate and corresponding lending rate.\n\nOn Friday, Nifty was helped by Reliance Industries (RIL), HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, L&T, HDFC, Kotak Bank, HUL, SBI, Axis Bank and Indusind Bank, while dragged by Infy, TCS, Power Grid, NTPC, ZEEL, TECHM, and HCL.\n\nOverall, on Friday the Indian market was helped by banks and financials, especially private bank, automobiles, FMCG, media, metal, pharma, reality energies, commodity, consumption, infra, and MNCs, while dragged by techs/IT negligible beneficiary of the corporate tax cut).\n\nTechnical View (Nifty, Bank Nifty, and USDINR-I):\n\nTechnically, whatever may be the narrative Nifty Future has to sustain over 11200-11240 for a further rally to 11290/11460*-11500/11555* and 11605/11650*-11690/11750* in the near term (under bullish case scenario).\n\nOn the flip side, sustaining below 11180 Nifty Future may fall to 11120/11075*-11000/10925* and 10875/10810*-10730/10640* in the near term (under bear case scenario).\n\nTechnically, Bank Nifty Future has to sustain over 29300-29700 for a further rally 29875/29975-30200/30450 and 30575/30850-31100/31325 in the near term (under bullish case scenario).\n\nOn the flip side, sustaining below 29250-28950* Bank Nifty Future may fall to 28600/28400*-28100*/27700 and 27400/27100-26800/26600* in the near term (under bear case scenario).\n\nTechnically, USDINR-I has to sustain over 70.20 for a rebound to 70.85*/71.30-72.00/72.65* and further rally to 72.95/73.65-74.00/74.50 in the near term (under bullish case scenario).\n\nNIFTY FUTURE\n\nOn the flip side, sustaining below 69.95, USDINR may fall to 69.60/68.85*-68.25/68.00* and 67.35/66.90-66.25/66.00* in the near term (under bear case scenario).", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Asis Ghosh covering: .
