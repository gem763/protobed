Not only had she raised just over $300,000\u2014a tenth of the $3 million-plus Crowley had on hand\u2014but the mainstream media had all but ignored her until her upset victory made national news. The night of her primary win, CNN host Brian Stelter admitted he\u2019d only learned of Ocasio-Cortez eight days before.\n\nBut one year later, Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s unlikely primary victory appears to be having a multiplying effect, helping to ensure that candidates following in the congresswoman\u2019s footsteps won\u2019t face the same uphill battle. As the media and progressives alike search for \u201cthe next AOC,\u201d insurgent candidates are receiving heightened attention and financial support that\u2019s giving them a fighting chance.\n\nMore than a year ahead of the 2020 election, every single one of the candidates backed by Justice Democrats, a political action committee that recruits and runs progressive candidates, is in a better financial position than Ocasio-Cortez ever was during her primary run, according to the organization\u2019s most recent financial report.\n\nOcasio-Cortez herself raised just $60,000 in 2017, the year before her victory. But at a comparable point in their own campaigns, first-timer Morgan Harper, who is challenging Rep. Joyce Beatty (D-OH), has raised $323,000; Marie Newman, who is trying to defeat Rep. Dan Lipinski (D-Ill.) for the second consecutive cycle, has raised $350,0000; and Jessica Cisneros, the 26-year-old primarying Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-TX) has raised $310,000 in the third quarter, $460,000 in total, and secured key endorsements from the pro-choice political action committee EMILY\u2019s List, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Ocasio-Cortez.\n\n\"Those key victories that happened in the last cycle inspired the entire nation and showed everyone it\u2019s possible to take on an entrenched incumbent when you\u2019re running a people-powered campaign,\u201d said Cisneros. \u201cThat\u2019s something that inspires me every day and shows all of the supporters in our district that we can have that same change here in south Texas.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the challengers from last cycle showed us what\u2019s possible,\u201d Harper agreed. \u201cI didn\u2019t always realize that without the party\u2019s support and without coming from a political family or a ton of money, you\u2019d be able to launch a viable and very progressive\u2014unapologetically progressive\u2014campaign and win.\u201d\n\nDemocratic consultants and polling experts said insurgent candidates have gotten more than just a confidence boost: They also may be tangibly benefiting from the seismic upsets freshman congresswomen like Ocasio-Cortez and Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) pulled off in 2018, which disrupted traditional ideas about who constitutes a viable candidate. Going into 2020, insurgent candidates can expect to be taken more seriously and earn more support early on from elected officials and national organizations.\n\n\u201cCandidates that might have been considered a \u2018long-shot\u2019\u2014such as first-time candidates without deep pockets running against establishment-backed incumbents\u2014two or three years ago now seem viable,\u201d David Duhalde, the lead facilitator for the Winning Primaries coalition, an initiative dedicated to identifying districts ripe for primary challenges, wrote in an email. \u201cTheir chances also increase, unsurprisingly, because people once defined as long shots are incorporated into the narrative of people who can\u2014and will\u2014win.\u201d\n\nThose narratives have also been internalized by the candidates themselves, who can better imagine a path to victory after seeing Ocasio-Cortez, Pressley, and others make their own way with small-dollar donations and a progressive agenda. Justice Democrats like Harper and Cisneros are running on a platform of Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, and a federal jobs guarantee\u2014campaign tenets that not too long ago were considered too fringe for mainstream political discussion.\n\nEven insurgent candidates who lost in 2018 have helped to inspire the 2020 class. Primary challengers like Brent Welder and Abdul El-Sayed fell short of beating incumbents in Kansas and Michigan, respectively, even with the support of Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT). But many of them nonetheless proved to be more competitive than conventional wisdom foretold, and helped push a bold progressive agenda closer to the forefront of the Democratic party.\n\n\u201cNow insurgent candidates who are running on big and bold visionary platforms are being given serious consideration,\u201d said Joe Dinkin, the national campaigns director of the Working Families Party. \u201cI think that the number of Democratic voters who are open to those big ideas has also grown dramatically.\u201d\n\nEven with newfound progressive energy, any victories are far from certain. Next year, Democratic incumbents will still benefit from a number of traditional advantages, such as name recognition, an established donor base, and institutional support.\n\nAfter 2018, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the body responsible for helping House Democrats hold onto their seats, instituted a new rule barring political consulting firms from working with anyone who is challenging a sitting House Democrat.\n\nThough many individual consultants and organizations, including EMILY\u2019s List, have openly defied the new DCCC policy, some primary challengers have subsequently faced difficulties staffing their 2020 campaigns. Earlier this year, two consultants left Newman\u2019s campaign because of the blacklist. Suraj Patel, another 2018 insurgent candidate, told the New York Times in June that he\u2019d already been turned down by three firms, who told him they couldn\u2019t help him with a second run.\n\nStill, incumbents have good reason to worry about primary challengers. Last cycle, insurgent and first-time candidates learned that longtime representatives of Democratic strongholds were often absent or inactive in the district, and typically counted on institutional support and corporate donations\u2014not door-knocking or grassroots organizing\u2014to carry them into their next term. \u201cWe were completely outspent in commercials and at the mailbox,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told Jacobin after her primary win. \u201cBut we were not outworked in the street.\u201d\n\nNow, insurgent candidates have a roadmap for how to take advantage of those vulnerabilities. Sean McElwee, cofounder of the progressive think tank Data for Progress, said some incumbents appear to be moving to the left to avoid looking \u201cout of step\u201d with the district, which can make them a target of a primary challenge.\n\n\u201cHaving a super charismatic woman candidate raise $400,000 in a single quarter sort of makes your life suck,\u201d he said.\n\nIf incumbents can\u2019t preempt a primary challenge, McElwee said they may quickly find themselves out of their depth, with few people who can help tailor a new path to victory for them.\u201cCandidates like Joyce Beatty\u201d\u2014the incumbent in Ohio\u2019s 3rd congressional district\u2014\u201care not going to know who to call to bail them out,\u201d McElwee said.\n\nMcElwee said the 2020 cycle has also attracted an even stronger crop of insurgent and first-time candidates, in part because more people are beginning to see challenging an incumbent as a feasible entry point into politics.\n\n\u201cOnce Ocasio-Cortez and Pressley showed that it was possible to win one of these primaries \u2026 people who had a lot of options open to them for their political careers decided running a primary challenge is no longer a dumb idea.\u201d\n\nYoung first-time women candidates will continue to face comparisons to Ocasio-Cortez throughout the election cycle. Cisneros, the first-timer challenging Cuellar in Texas\u2019 28th congressional district, said it\u2019s important to remember that there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all campaign strategy.\n\n\u201cWe do have to recognize that every race is different because every district is different,\u201d Cisneros said. \u201cYour ground game has to adapt to the place where you\u2019re running.\u201d\n\nCisneros understands that part of the reason she\u2019s been compared to Ocasio-Cortez is because neither are a \u201ctraditional candidate.\u201d Both of them are young, Latina, and from working class families. But she hopes one day such comparisons won\u2019t be necessary.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to see people excited about folks that don\u2019t fit the typical profile,\u201d Cisneros said. \u201cBut the point is to get more of us in office so it\u2019s not a surprise to anyone anymore.\u201d\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nFollow Marie Solis on Twitter.", "description": "The new class of Democratic primary challengers is in a better position than Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was at this point in her race\u2014thanks in large part to her victory.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5db32cd6c203ad008d17d02b/lede/1572024536314-The-AOC-Bump-Is-Helping-Insurgent-Candidates-Following-In-her-Footsteps_HF.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
