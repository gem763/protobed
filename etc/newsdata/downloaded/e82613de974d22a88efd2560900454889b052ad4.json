He nevertheless stopped public ministry and moved out of his Bronx parish.\n\nCardinal Timothy Dolan said the archdiocese's lay review board had found the allegation to be \"credible and substantiated,\" and he turned the case over to the Holy See for further investigation, since only the pope can decide a bishop's fate.\n\nJenik turned 75 in March, the normal retirement age for bishops. As a result, it wasn't immediately clear if Vatican made any determination about the abuse allegation.\n\nFor decades, the Vatican turned a blind eye to bishops and cardinals who raped and molested children and adults or covered up the crimes.\n\nIt was Dolan's archdiocese that received complaints about sexual misconduct by ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, cases that launched a new reckoning in the U.S. Catholic Church hierarchy.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
