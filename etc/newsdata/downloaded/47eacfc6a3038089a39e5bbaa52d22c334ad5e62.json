I simply want to make an observation. When liberals quote the Bible to support their views, nobody bats an eyelash (aside from conservatives raising charges of hypocrisy). When conservatives quote the Bible to support their views, liberals howl, \u201cSeparation of Church and state!\u201d\n\nBut this has been the pattern for years. Christian faith on the left is praiseworthy. Christian faith on the right is dangerous.\n\nThink back to the 1988 presidential election when both Pat Robertson and Jesse Jackson ran for president.\n\nIn September, 1987, the New York Times announced, \u201cRobertson Quits as Baptist Minister.\u201d\n\nHe did this in order to run as president, thereby making clear he was not doing so as a gospel minister but simply as another citizen of the United States.\n\nIn contrast, Jesse Jackson continued to be known as \u201cThe Reverend Jesse Jackson.\u201d No problem at all! No conflict, no confusion, no issue.\n\nIt\u2019s the same until this day.\n\nFor years now, Senator Ted Cruz, along with other, conservative Christian candidates, are accused of holding to dominion theology, meaning, they want to impose a Christian theocracy on the nation.\n\nIs there even a shred of evidence for this? Not a chance.\n\nBut why should that stop the fearmongers who cry out, \u201cSeparation of Church and state!\u201d\n\nIn contrast, Mayor Pete Buttigieg can quote the Bible to his heart\u2019s content to support his immigration policies (and other policies), and that\u2019s perfectly fine. No separation of church and state here.\n\nWhat happens when conservative Christians quote Scripture to support their views on abortion or same-sex \u201cmarriage\u201d?\n\nThey are hate-mongers and bigots who want to impose their view of God on America. They are dominionists and theocrats. They are dangerous!\n\nWhat happens when liberal Christians quote scriptures to support their views on abortion or same-sex \u201cmarriage\u201d?\n\nThey are enlightened and tolerant. They are people of conscience. They are helpful. They are virtuous!\n\nIn the same way, it would not go well for a conservative to quote Scripture in support of the Second Amendment. But it\u2019s no problem when a liberal like Alyssa Milano quotes 1 Peter 4:8 in support of gun control. (For the record, I\u2019m not equating the right to bear arms with the sanctity of life in the womb or the definition of marriage as one man and one woman for life. I\u2019m simply comparing the right\u2019s use of Scripture with the left\u2019s use of Scripture. And I\u2019m making no comment about Milano\u2019s misuse of 1 Peter 4:8, which is completely unrelated to gun control.)\n\nSomeone might say to me, \u201cBut you\u2019re missing the whole point. The issue is not quoting the Bible. The issue is your interpretation of the Bible. Your views are dangerous. The views on the left are not. We\u2019re for a women\u2019s right to choose, for a couple\u2019s right to love each other. You\u2019re the ones with the bigoted and destructive views. You\u2019re the ones trying to impose your values on us.\u201d\n\nBut that is entirely besides the point (aside from the fact that the arguments are easily refuted on other grounds).\n\nThe point is the alleged separation of church and state, period.\n\nThat alleged separation does not only apply when the religious views are deemed dangerous. It applies across the board, as in, \u201cYou can\u2019t bring your religion to bear on public policy!\u201d\n\nAgain, that is the opposite of what the \u201cwall of separation\u201d was intended to do (it was intended to keep the state out of the church and to prevent a one-state religion).\n\nBut in keeping with the contemporary misapplication of the principle, it is only enforced in one direction.\n\nWe only hear cries of \u201cSeparation!\u201d when conservatives point to Scripture to support their views.\n\nSomeone might protest, \u201cBut you\u2019re still missing the point. Evangelical Christians are a large and substantial voting bloc, so their religiously-based votes are more dangerous.\u201d\n\nBut, to repeat, that is to miss the point. The alleged separation is not based on numbers but on principle. Let it be applied equally both ways. (And would the Democrats have any problem if large numbers of liberal Christians voted their way? Hardly.)\n\nOf course, my preference is that we rightly understand what the wall of separation is about, and that we then apply it equally, keeping the state from meddling with religious affairs.\n\nBut until such time that we get that right, then let the liberals shut down the leftist ministers who openly support their politicians. And let the liberals tell Mayor Pete to stop quoting Scripture. And let the liberals cry \u201cSeparation\u201d on their own people.\n\nI don\u2019t think so!\n\nIronically, at the same time that the Democrats now present themselves as the party for the non-religious, they welcome religious support for their views. As long as the theology is left-leaning, it\u2019s kosher.", "description": "Let\u2019s put aside for a moment that the current idea .09/03/2019 19:37:11PM EST.", "authors": ["Michael Brown", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/211/20f05fd6-fa97-4271-9eec-934f4e88f5eb.png"}
