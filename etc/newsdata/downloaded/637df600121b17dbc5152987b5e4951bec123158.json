It\u2019s now called the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) Gold Price auction. The LBMA will tell you that that the change had nothing to do with the activities of trader Daniel Plunkett in the early part of this decade.\n\nPlunkett was a director on the bank\u2019s precious metals desk who, realising that his employer would have had to make a chunky payment to a client if the price was \u201cfixed\u201d above a certain level on 28 June 2012, placed a series of trades with the aim of preventing that outcome.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIt worked. Just not for long, because the client smelt a rat and raised concerns. A subsequent Financial Conduct Authority investigation ultimately led to the bank being fined \u00a326m for failing to manage conflicts of interest and maintain appropriate systems and controls. It had previously compensated the client. Plunkett was ordered to pay a \u00a395,600 penalty and banned from the City.\n\nConflicts have always been a potential issue with the gold fix \u2013 sorry, the LBMA Gold Price auction \u2013 because the banks involved in the process both act for clients and trade their own books.\n\nWhat the fix does is create what\u2019s known as a \u201cbenchmark\u201d price for those buying and selling the stuff to use. Jewellers, for example.\n\nIts origins date back to the victorious powers\u2019 desire to stabilise the precious metal\u2019s price at the end of the First World War. NM Rothschild, the merchant bank that was built on the stuff, was the obvious candidate to chair the formalisation of what had previously been an ad-hoc process conducted in smoke-filled rooms.\n\nAt first it took place over the phone, but soon moved into the bank\u2019s offices at St Swithin\u2019s Lane where it remained for more than 80 years. Sessions took place in high secrecy, with all external communication barred.\n\nEach of the participating brokers had a desk and a miniature union flag, which remained up when they were on the phone. When they were happy that they could match enough of their buy and sell orders at a particular price, they would lower the flag. There would usually be several rounds of horse-trading, with the process ending only when all the flags were lowered. At that point, the price was declared \u201cfixed\u201d and broadcast around the world.\n\nAfter a certain amount of persuasion, I was once allowed to have a look around the rather non-descript room where this took place. However, no matter how hard I, and others, tried, and no matter what conditions we said we would agree to, there was no way they were going to let anyone in to actually watch a session. Read into that what you will.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

There were real questions about whether it would survive this. There were four participants left: Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Societe Generale, and Canada's Scotia Bank. The last of those was seen as a potential candidate to follow Rothschild out of the door.\n\nIn the meantime, they moved to rotate the chair and replace the office-based routine with a conference call. So no more flags, although one of them resides today in the LBMA boardroom.\n\nContrary to those who had predicted its doom, the fix survived long enough for Plunkett to raise a fresh set of questions. It survived that too.\n\nThe market and its participants had to accept regulation (the Financial Conduct Authority resorted to its principles for businesses rules to discipline the bank and its broker because the market itself was not regulated at the time) but since then, the number of participants has steadily increased.\n\nThere are now 15 organisations involved in the process, which has been modernised with technology.\n\nSome of the banks that take part, it\u2019s true, may be there as much for the prestige as any money they make from it. But the important point is that they are there, and in London, which continues to dominate the physical gold market. It\u2019s a market that has been hot in recent times. The current global instability has driven the metal\u2019s price higher as a result of its perception as a safe haven, which generates volume. Central banks last year bought more than they had in any of the last 50 years. Russia was particularly active but it was not alone.\n\nThe capital\u2019s position in the market is one of the few things that won\u2019t be much affected if Britain\u2019s right-wing prime minister Boris Johnson succeeds with his intent to smash his country in the mouth via a no deal Brexit.\n\nBecause gold is so expensive, and is moved around in relatively small quantities, it is usually transported by plane. There is therefore no risk of it getting held up along with food and vital medical supplies in a container at a port straining under the weight of the chaos being sown by a political party that lost its sanity some time ago.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

If you were starting a market for a new commodity from scratch and someone proposed something like it, they would likely be laughed out of the room.\n\nBut it has the weight of a deep history behind it, and despite the problems it has encountered, there seems to be a demand for it.
