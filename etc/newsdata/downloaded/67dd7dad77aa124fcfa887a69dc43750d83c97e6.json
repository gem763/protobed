(Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)\n\nAfter two productive days of talks in Washington, sources told Bloomberg Friday that the U.S. and China agreed to a partial trade deal, laying the foundation for a broad deal that Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping could sign later this year.\n\n\u201cChina would agree to some agricultural concessions and the U.S. would provide some tariff relief,\u201d Bloomberg reports. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin announced in a press conference Friday afternoon that President Trump is set to meet with China\u2019s Vice Premier Liu He later in the day, but did not confirm an agreement, saying the U.S. has had \u201ca productive two days\u201d of negotiations with the Chinese.\n\nFriday morning, Trump seemingly tweeted in anticipation of the deal.\n\nOne of the great things about the China Deal is the fact that, for various reasons, we do not have to go through the very long and politically complex Congressional Approval Process. When the deal is fully negotiated, I sign it myself on behalf of our Country. Fast and Clean! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 11, 2019\n\nThis is developing story and will be updated.", "description": "After two productive days of talks, the U.S. and China laid the foundation for a broad deal that Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping could sign later this year.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Kevin D.
