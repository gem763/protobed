HKEX had said the LSE would have to drop the Refinitiv purchase for its offer to go ahead.\n\nWhen HKEX announced its surprise move, analysts had also said the perception that Beijing was exerting growing influence over Hong Kong could become another key sticking point for an LSE takeover, given the Hong Kong government's close links with the HKEX at a time of major unrest in the city over its ties with mainland China.\n\nThe LSE was not immediately available to comment on HKEX's announcement on Tuesday.", "description": "Analysts say perception of Beijing's influence in Hong Kong could have been a deterrent to LSE agreeing to a merger.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/8/b5f51e9f60a94203afa1694c647f58ea_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
