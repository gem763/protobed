Subsequently, she has done a really bad job of planning for retirement. Out of her MANY marriages, I am her only child, and I knew that she would eventually knock on my door with the assumption that I would be her last stop.\n\n\u2018Having Mom in the house is kind of like having a 20-year-old child.\u2019\n\nMy husband and I took her in about three years ago. Right now, it\u2019s a mutually beneficial situation: She lives with us for free in exchange for watching our two youngest kids during the day, and we get free child care out of the situation, which would otherwise be an absolutely massive expense in our area.\n\nThat said, my emotionally needy mother lives with me, her health isn\u2019t the best, and we want to downsize in four to five years.\n\nWe\u2019ve danced around the fact that she probably won\u2019t live with us forever. For a lot of reasons, we can\u2019t be her nursing home if she winds up needing much more than we already provide. Given her medical history and never-ending cycle of specialist appointments, I suspect she will.\n\nRecently, I told her that I was going to set up an appointment for her to speak to a Medicaid specialist, and you would think she\u2019d watched me kick a puppy down the stairs.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not sure how much longer I can take parenting her before I snap.\u2019\n\nHaving Mom in the house is kind of like having a 20-year-old child. She\u2019s mostly helpful and can obviously be trusted, but she still requires parenting.\n\nHow do I help my mother understand that I can\u2019t and won\u2019t sacrifice the well-being of my family or my own retirement on the altar of her poor planning and unwillingness to even try to take care of herself? I\u2019m not sure how much longer I can take parenting her before I snap.\n\nA 39-year-old Stressed-Out Daughter and De Facto Parent in Virginia\n\nDear Stressed Out,\n\nI\u2019m still stuck on those capital letters. I\u2019m wondering just how many times your mother has been married, but that\u2019s really none of my business. I have received many letters from parents complaining about their entitled children, usually adult children who are either Generation X or millennials. (I\u2019m happy to debunk the tired old trope that all millennials are entitled.) Rarely, however, have I received a letter about parents who are entitled. I am not including those parents who stole their children\u2019s identities and racked up tens of thousands of credit-card bills; obviously, the entitlement in those cases speaks for itself.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: My mother stole my identity and racked up $500,000 in debt\n\nYou\u2019re putting a plan together for your mother, and it\u2019s clearly not to her liking. You have no control over that. I\u2019m curious if you would feel differently if she were an easier person to get along with and/or you did not have such a fractured relationship. It sounds like you have built a good life, one that may have been in spite of rather than due to your mother\u2019s example and your own upbringing. This appears to be a relationship with a lot of history, and more than its share of resentments. I make no judgment, as I don\u2019t know any of the details of your childhood. You know where your boundaries are and I will operate on that principle.\n\nYou can start by being honest and direct. Outline your plans as a family, and your budget. Thank her for being a grandmother to your kids and for babysitting while you and your husband were at work. Tell your mother what you are able and unable to do for her, and where you draw the line. Then give her the information she needs to make her own decision. From what you say, if she were to live independently, she would qualify for Medicaid. Assuming she has no long-term care insurance, Medicaid is likely her best option. You didn\u2019t create this situation and you can\u2019t control what your mother decides to do. You can\u2019t fix her life for her, but you can show her the way.\n\nRead MarketWatch\u2019s Moneyist advice column on the etiquette and ethics of your financial affairs. This week: \u2018I earn twice what my husband makes and pay all the bills, but have no idea how much money he\u2019s saved?\u2019\n\nThere is a long-term elder-care crisis in America, and your mother is one of millions of people who must navigate this thorny issue. She\u2019s not alone and there is plenty of help out there. Those eligible for Medicaid are older adults or people with a disability who meet certain requirements, such as having income and assets below certain levels. You can read more here. Medicaid, for those who qualify, pays for more than half of long-term care expenses. Nearly 20% of Medicaid expenses currently go to the elderly, primarily for long-term care.\n\nAs Max Richtman, the president and chief executive of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, a nonprofit that promotes the financial security, health and well-being of older Americans, recently wrote on MarketWatch: \u201cMost seniors simply don\u2019t have the average $100,000 a year for a nursing home, $45,000 for assisted living, or $33,000 for in-home care.\u201d He added, \u201cMany middle-class seniors are forced to impoverish themselves by exhausting their hard-earned savings simply to qualify for Medicaid.\u201d\n\nRecommended: My second wife wants me to put her name on my home \u2014 and refinance so we can buy another house together\n\nYou are putting together a strategic plan for your children\u2019s education and your retirement. I respect that. There are organizations that could help you and your mother: the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association, the Long-Term Care Financing Collaborative, the American Council on Aging and the Family Caregiver Alliance. You don\u2019t want to cloud the issue with emotions or ill-chosen words that you will regret later. It\u2019s smart to plan four to five years ahead. It\u2019s best to have this conversation with your mother when you are not in the midst of a crisis and you both have clear heads.\n\nYou mother is providing day care and you are giving her a place to live. It\u2019s an equal exchange and, while it is transactional at least from your end, it\u2019s also practical. It helps both of you. In an ideal world with a healthy, happy relationship, you would allow your parent to live with you and take care of her as she did for you as a child. But I don\u2019t know what your childhood was like and I don\u2019t know either of you, so I am taking your letter at face value and reading between the lines that this is not a healthy relationship for you. You do have agency and the right to live you life as you want to live it. You have the right to set boundaries and to be free.\n\nIn therapy circles, they call this process \u201cdetach with love.\u201d With that in mind, I would leave all references to puppies and stairwells out of it.\n\nDo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money?
