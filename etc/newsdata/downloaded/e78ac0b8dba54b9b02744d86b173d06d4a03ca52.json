Democrats Test Trump's Impeachment Strategy", "language": "en", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump is rapidly confronting a decision at the core of House Democrats\u2019 nascent impeachment inquiry: Should he comply with congressional demands and risk disclosure of embarrassing information? Or should he delay and possibly deepen his legal and political predicament?\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Adam Schiff, the intelligence committee chairman, issued a blunt warning to the president Wednesday, threatening to make White House defiance of a congressional request for testimony and documents potential grounds for an article of impeachment.\n\nWith the prospect of new subpoenas coming as soon as Friday, Trump\u2019s official policy of deliberate non-cooperation, and his view of executive power, could be tested quickly.\n\n\u201cWe want to make it abundantly clear that any effort by (Secretary of State Mike Pompeo), by the president or anyone else to interfere with the Congress\u2019 ability to call before it relevant witnesses will be considered as evidence of obstruction of the lawful functions of Congress,\u201d Schiff said in a Wednesday news conference.\n\nFor his part, Trump maintained, \u201cWell, I always cooperate,\u201d without explicitly saying he would comply with the request. He then derided Pelosi, saying she \u201chands out subpoenas like they\u2019re cookies.\u201d\n\nThe White House strategy toward congressional oversight has often been open scorn. The Republican president\u2019s aides have ignored document requests and subpoenas, invoked executive privilege _ so far as to argue that executive privilege extends to informal presidential advisers who\u2019ve never held White House roles _ and all but dared Democrats to hold them in contempt.\n\nAs the impeachment inquiry accelerates, the White House\u2019s stonewalling appears likely to continue.\n\n\u201cThis is a hoax,\u201d Trump said, immediately after professing his commitment to cooperation. He then launched into a diatribe on the impeachment inquiry, which has centered on his request in the July call for Ukraine\u2019s president to assist in digging up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden. \u201cThis is the greatest hoax. This is just a continuation of what\u2019s been playing out since my election.\u201d\n\nIn public and private, Trump has angrily dismissed the impeachment investigation as an illegitimate, purely partisan effort to topple him, according to three White House officials not authorized to speak about private conversations. And he praised Pompeo\u2019s initial combative response to the Democrats\u2019 requests this week, one of the officials said.\n\nIt\u2019s part of an emerging political and legal strategy informed by Trump\u2019s time in the two-year crucible of the special counsel\u2019s Russia investigation.\n\nThe president\u2019s first team of lawyers was inclined to cooperate with Robert Mueller, believing it would help bring the investigation to a swift conclusion. But once Jay Sekulow and Rudy Giuliani took over, they largely ceased cooperation, attacked Mueller\u2019s integrity and shielded Trump from testifying in person. They believe the moves inoculated the president legally and solidified his standing politically. Giuliani and Sekulow remain part of the president\u2019s outside counsel.\n\nTrump\u2019s legal team privately cheered as the Mueller investigation bled into its third year in 2019 _ in part because of their stall tactics on whether Trump would consent to the Mueller interview. Now they are bent on ensuring the current probe is anything but the quick process desired by Democrats, who are wary of its impact on the 2020 presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not fooling around here,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want this to drag on for months and months, which appears to be the administration\u2019s strategy.\u201d\n\nWhite House allies argue that the Democratic demands are overly broad and raise issues of executive privilege and immunity, jeopardizing the longstanding interests of the co-equal branch of government. But Democrats are making the precise counter-argument, that Trump is claiming superiority of the executive branch over the legislative in a manner that defies the Constitution.\n\nIt\u2019s a foot-dragging response that also serves Trump\u2019s political interests _ he has hoped to use impeachment as a rallying cry for his supporter base in the election year.\n\nDemocrats have sought to use their declared impeachment investigation to bolster their case to access all sorts of documents from the administration, most recently secret grand jury information that underpinned Mueller\u2019s report. And where courts have generally required congressional oversight requests to demonstrate a legitimate legislative purpose, impeachment requests could be wide-ranging.\n\nSome Republicans have raised doubts that the unilateral declaration of impeachment would grant the House those powers. Trump allies have questioned the form of the impeachment investigation, which, unlike those into Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton, was begun without a formal vote of the House.\n\nThey suggest that without a formal vote, the House is merely conducting oversight. The Justice Department raised similar arguments last month, though it was before Pelosi announced the impeachment investigation.\n\nThere\u2019s no clear-cut procedure in the Constitution for launching an impeachment inquiry, leaving many of these questions about obstruction untested in court, said Allan Lichtman, a history professor at American University.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no specification in the Constitution in what does and does not constitute a more formal impeachment inquiry or investigation,\u201d he said. \u201cOne can argue if they\u2019re in an impeachment investigation, they\u2019re in an impeachment.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department said in a court filing Wednesday it had instructed \u201crelevant personnel\u201d to preserve six categories of records as part of a lawsuit over how the White House handles calls with foreign dignitaries. They include documents that could reveal efforts by officials to limit access to records of a July phone call Trump made to the Ukraine president and documents about the government\u2019s record-keeping policies.\n\nThe Justice Department said in the filing that White House officials had already been previously told to maintain all presidential records, both in hard-copy and electronic form. The government said it would \u201cvoluntarily agree\u201d to preserve the material as motions in the case play out in court.\n\nIt is unclear if Democrats would wade into a lengthy legal fight with the administration over documents and testimony _ or if they would just move straight to considering articles of impeachment.\n\nSchiff said Democrats will \u201chave to decide whether to litigate, or how to litigate.\u201d\n\nDemocrats might have a marginally stronger case in court fights over documents they want from the administration now that they\u2019ve initiated an impeachment inquiry. But more important is the prospect of incorporating into impeachment itself the White House\u2019s refusal to cooperate, said Elliot Mincberg, senior counsel for the liberal People for the American Way.\n\nIf the White House won\u2019t provide fuller transcripts of Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Ukraine\u2019s president, for example, that could serve \u201cboth as evidence to support other allegations and itself impeachable conduct. That\u2019s leverage the Democrats did not previously claim that they have now quite explicitly claimed,\u201d said Mincberg, who previously served as a lawyer for the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nJennifer Victor, a political science professor at George Mason University, said the impeachment inquiry \u201cups the ante in a checks-and-balances political game with the executive branch. The heightened public spotlight makes it more difficult for the executive branch to skirt requests to appear or deliver documents.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Michael Balsamo, Lisa Mascaro and Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.", "description": "With the prospect of new subpoenas coming as soon as Friday, Trump\u2019s official policy of deliberate non-cooperation could be tested quickly.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d95f059210000670351f335.jpeg?cache=zmixv7ds68&ops=1778_1000"}
