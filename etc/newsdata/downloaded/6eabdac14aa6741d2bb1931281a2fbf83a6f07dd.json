A court document also indicates the case is related to Huawei.\n\nMao, an associate professor at Xiamen University in China who also became a visiting professor at a Texas university last fall, first gained attention as part of a Texas civil case between Huawei and Silicon Valley startup CNEX Labs Inc.\n\nIn December 2017, Huawei sued CNEX and a former employee, Yiren Huang, for stealing trade secrets.
