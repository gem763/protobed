The highly influential MSNBC host expressed deep concern that her own company\u2019s bosses had thwarted Farrow\u2019s reporting on sexual misconduct allegations against Harvey Weinstein \u2014 reporting which he then took to The New Yorker, where he won a Pulitzer Prize.\n\nMaddow also pointedly questioned NBC\u2019s failure to launch an independent investigation of both the handling of the Weinstein story and of the behavior of Matt Lauer, the former \u201cToday\u201d anchor fired in 2017 over sexual misconduct allegations.\n\nOn Saturday, Tina Tchen, incoming president and CEO of Time\u2019s Up, said NBC Universal, while taking a useful first step, hadn\u2019t gone far enough to release employees from non-disclosure agreements or other restrictive clauses. She said NBC should simply state that everyone is free to speak, without fear of retaliation.\n\n\u201cIf NBC Universal is truly committed to letting survivors and employees speak out about sexual harassment at the network, it should simply release them from their non-disclosure agreements,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no reason to place the burden on those who choose to speak to reveal themselves in advance to NBC Universal. This is an example of the burdens that perpetuate fear and silence, no matter what new policies and trainings may say.\u201d\n\nTchen, who takes up her duties next week, added that the company must, like some other companies have, commit \u201cto an independent, outside investigation into all the circumstances surrounding workplace culture at NBC and the journalistic decisions made at this important news outlet \u2026 As an employer and especially as a news organization, NBC Universal should want to know the unvarnished truth.\u201d\n\nNBC conducted its own internal investigation on the actions of its executives into how Farrow\u2019s Weinstein story was handled, and how sexual misconduct allegations were handled.\n\nIt concluded that its judgments on the Weinstein story were correct, based on the material Farrow had at the time. Farrow also alleged that NBC executives were aware of sexual misconduct by Lauer before the allegation that led to his firing, but NBC has denied it.\n\nAlso calling for further action by NBC Universal was Linda Vester, a former NBC News employee who has accused NBC star anchor Tom Brokaw of sexual harassment and now heads a group called Silence Breakers Alliance.\n\n\u201cWhy is NBC forcing these women who have already endured trauma to come crawling on their hands and knees, to ask the company to let them speak?\u201d she asked in an interview Saturday. \u201cThis would be evidence that the company is re-traumatizing the victim and trying to keep them under its thumb.\u201d Vester has also been calling for NBC Universal to allow an independent inquiry.\n\nFriday\u2019s remarks by Maddow came in a monologue introducing Farrow, who is on a publicity tour for his book, \u201cCatch and Kill,\u201d in which he outlines his view of roadblocks NBC News set up that led him to take his Weinstein story to The New Yorker. It also includes an interview with a former NBC News employee who alleges she was raped by Matt Lauer, who denies the charge.\n\n\u201cThe allegations about the behavior of Harvey Weinstein and Matt Lauer are gut-wrenching at baseline, no matter who you are or what your connection is to this story,\u201d Maddow told her viewers.\n\n\u201cBut accusations that people in positions of authority in this building may have been complicit in some way of shielding those guys from accountability, those accusations are very, very hard to stomach.\u201d\n\nMaddow continued: \u201cThe amount of consternation this has caused among the rank and file people who work here would be almost impossible for me to overstate.\u201d\n\nIn its statement, NBC Universal said that NBC News \u201chas only two agreements with women relating to complaints of sexual harassment by Lauer \u2014 both entered into after his termination \u2014 and both women are free to tell their stories about Lauer.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press media writer David Bauder contributed to this report.", "description": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Activists called upon NBC Universal on Saturday to allow former employees to speak out freely on sexual harassment in the workplace", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/26/b661d6_nbc-times-up-54194-rachel-maddow-in-oct-16-2017-file-photo-msnbc-television-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
