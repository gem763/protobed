The logic of past Brexit negotiations suggests that the less we hear about what\u2019s happening in intensive Brussels talks, the greater the chance that those talks are getting somewhere. Once the details start to leak and the anonymous briefings start, what\u2019s left tends to be dead on arrival.\n\nYet even with scant details on the new negotiations between the Brits and the EU, or what concessions either side might have made to activate them, it\u2019s possible to draw some conclusions about what\u2019s being discussed.\n\nFirst, what it doesn\u2019t mean. The quiet luxury wedding venue in Cheshire, where U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson met with his Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar on Thursday (discovering a \u201cpathway to a possible deal\u201d) is a long way from the Justus Lipsius building in Brussels, or wherever the nitty-gritty of any possible Brexit deal might be thrashed out. As my colleague Lionel Laurent wrote on Friday, negotiations don\u2019t mean an agreement is a sure thing; there are many degrees of separation between the parties.\n\nAny deal must satisfy three requirements if it\u2019s going to fly politically in the U.K. and the EU. It must let Johnson bring Britain out of the bloc by Oct. 31 or very soon after, as he has promised his supporters. Second, Northern Ireland must be deemed part of the U.K. customs territory for any future trade deals struck by Britain. Third, an agreement would have to avoid customs checks in Ireland that would threaten either the Good Friday peace settlement or the EU\u2019s single market rules.\n\nOnce a deal ticks those seemingly contradictory boxes, it must also pass muster with the Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland. The DUP leader Arlene Foster gets very twitchy about anything that separates Northern Ireland from the rest of the U.K. Without her support of any compromise agreement, it will be very difficult for hardline Brexiters in Johnson\u2019s ruling Conservative Party to back a deal. That means Johnson would have to rely on Labour MPs if a deal came to a parliamentary vote, although he\u2019d be unlikely to put his initials on one without some assurance of support from his own side.\n\nThe window in which to sell any agreement would be small. If, as many suspect, Johnson is considering a variation on part of his predecessor Theresa May\u2019s maligned Chequers deal \u2014 a \u201ccustoms partnership\u201d with the EU but that includes only Northern Ireland rather than her plan to include the whole of the U.K. \u2014 agreement would be difficult to secure and implementation would be messy. It would also be ironic since Johnson resigned over May\u2019s plan and the EU rejected it out of hand.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing in Johnson\u2019s past that suggests he\u2019s a slave to his positions, quite the contrary. He\u2019s perfectly happy, shamelessly so at times, of changing with the wind if it delivers political victory. By contrast, everything in the DUP\u2019s history suggests that it doesn\u2019t budge even when the case for doing so is compelling. It says it won\u2019t accept Northern Ireland staying in the EU\u2019s customs union.\n\nIreland\u2019s own position is delicate too. Any Varadkar concessions would need to be less onerous than the cost to Ireland of accepting no deal. Each side will be doing rapid calculations of whether a deal works better than the ugliest alternatives.\n\nYou can see why there\u2019s been an 11th hour push, though. If Varadkar and Johnson hadn\u2019t found their \u201cpathway,\u201d there wouldn\u2019t have been much to discuss at next week\u2019s EU council meeting other than an extension to the Halloween Brexit date.\n\nThat would have been grim for Johnson, who\u2019s been forced by his own parliament to seek an extension if he can\u2019t strike a deal. For someone who won the Conservative leadership on a promise of leaving on Oct. 31, \u201cno ifs or buts,\u201d having to ask for a delay is an unappetizing prospect.\n\nOn the EU side, they\u2019d no doubt rather get this done and move on to other things before a new European Commission takes its seat and before a new budget is voted on next year; especially if they can avoid chucking Dublin under a bus.\n\nEven though the two sides haven\u2019t yet entered the famed negotiating \u201ctunnel,\u201d where they pore over the draft legal text of an agreement, at least they appear to be struggling toward the light. That doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll get there. But the alternatives of an eternal Brexit process (or no deal) are far darker places.", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- No news can be\u00a0good news sometimes.
