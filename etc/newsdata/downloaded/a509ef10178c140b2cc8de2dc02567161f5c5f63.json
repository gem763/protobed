On page 129, there's an exchange between a mother and son that reads:\n\n\"Et tu es assez vieux maintenant pour comprendre que, dans la vie, on ne fait pas toujours ce qu'on veut et qu'on est souvent le n\u00e8gre de quelqu'un et que ce quelqu'un-l\u00e0, c'est moi!\"\n\nIn English that translates to:\n\n\"And you're old enough now to understand that in life we do not always do what we want and that we are often someone's Negro, and that someone is me.\"\n\nIn French, the word N\u00e8gre can mean both Negro and the N-word.\n\nQuincy Francois with the book Un Cadavre de Classe by Robert Souli\u00e8res. He was assigned to read the book as a school assignment in May. (CBC)\n\n\"I was shocked,\" Gioberti Francois said.\n\nFrancois said his son Quincy, 12, was reading the book in the back seat of their car in May as they were returning from a trip to Montreal. Quincy, who at the time was attending \u00c8coles des Cavaliers in Gatineau's Aylmer sector, was reading aloud when Francois heard the offensive word.\n\n\"I actually stopped the car to read it,\" he said.\n\nComplained to school, board, ministry\n\nThe passage continues on page 130 to read:\n\n\"Alors ob\u00e9is et cesse de parlementer avec l'autorit\u00e9 ... Et ne me traite pas de raciste, car tu sais parfaitement ce que je veux dire par l\u00e0.\"\n\nThat translates to:\n\n\"So obey and stop arguing with authority ... And don't accuse me of being racist, because you know exactly what I mean by that.\"\n\nBut \"racist\" is exactly what Francois thought the phrase was, prompting him to write a letter to the school, the school board, the ministry of education and eventually, Quebec's human rights commission.\n\nGioberti Francois has filed a human rights complaint over Robert Souli\u00e8res's book Un Cadavre de Classe, which contains the word 'n\u00e8gre,' which in French is used to mean both Negro and the N-word. (Supplied)\n\n\"Sometimes we live with ... [a] relic of the past,\" Francois said. \"And sometimes it's a movement, like what I'm doing, that will allow us to remove this in our society.\"\n\nThe local public school board, Commission Scolaire des Portages-de-l'Outaouais (CSPO), said Quincy's former school stopped using the book at the end of the 2018-2019 school year, but it could not confirm whether students at other schools within the board were still reading it.\n\nRacist history\n\nThe board said the book was used as an educational tool to help children identify difficult vocabulary and highlight societal issues, including racism. The book was chosen, the board said, to educate young people about the issue.\n\nBut Francois said his son read the passage without an understanding of what the word N\u00e8gre meant, or its racist history.\n\nGioberti Francois filed a human rights complaint after his son was assigned to read a book containing the N-word in elementary school. MP Greg Fergus says the incident may serve as an opportunity for a conversation about systemic racism. 0:55\n\n\"He wasn't aware of that,\" Francois said.\n\n\"So ... we talked about systemic racism, black history and what effect [that word] could have on our society as a whole.\"\n\nThe children's book is endorsed by Quebec's Education Ministry and remains on its Open Books website. In an emailed statement to CBC News, the ministry said it's looking into the issue.\n\nNot the 1st time\n\nIn 2010, the word N\u00e8gre landed French parfumier Jean-Paul Guerlain in hot water.\n\nHe was found guilty of racial slander and ordered to pay \u20ac6,000 after remarking during a television interview that he had worked like a \"N\u00e8gre\" to create one of his company's scents, according to Agence France Presse .\n\nGuerlain later apologized, saying he was from a different generation when the expression was common.\n\nLiberal MP for Aylmer Greg Fergus says we shouldn't shy away from having discussions around why words like 'n\u00e8gre' are offensive. (Idil Mussa/CBC)\n\nThe Liberal MP for Hull\u2013Aylmer, Greg Fergus, said he considers the word to be offensive and believes it should go the way of other historic phrases that employ prejudiced notions about minorities.\n\n\"If you use those kind of phrases, what does that make you think of the people who belong to those groups? If you are Jewish, if you are Roma or if you're black,\" said Fergus, who is black.\n\nFergus said it's important for teachers and educators to talk openly about why words like N\u00e8gre are offensive if students are to understand why they're hurtful.\n\n\"We can't completely sanitize our history and culture and nor should we,\" he said.\n\n\"But what we should do is have a conversation around it. Why was that word being used? What is the subtext? What is the context in which it's being used?\"\n\nWhen Gioberti Francois' son was reading one of his school books out loud in the car, a particular passage shocked Gioberti so much he asked his son to repeat it and then stopped the car to read it for himself. 9:03\n\nFrancois said his human rights complaint is in part about creating an opportunity for learning and growth.\n\n\"We can complain, we can fight about this, but at the end of the day, what we want for our children is a better world.\"", "description": "A father in Gatineau, Que., has filed a human rights complaint after his son was assigned to read a book containing the N-word in\u00a0elementary school.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5332573.1571861210!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/quincy-and-gioberti-francois.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
