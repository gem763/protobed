The \"Storm Area 51\" Facebook event went viral last month as people pledged to crash the secret military base in an attempt to \"see them aliens\" and has grown in scale in recent weeks. More than 2 million Facebook users have now said they are going, with over 1.4 million replying they were interested.\n\nThe event, which is scheduled to take place Friday, Sept. 20 between 3 a.m. and 6 a.m. PDT, has garnered significant media attention, enough for the Air Force to issue a statement saying that it \"would discourage anyone from trying to come into the area where we train American armed forces.\" It added that it [the U.S. Air Force] \"always stands ready to protect America and its assets.\"\n\nWHAT'S AREA 51, AND WHY IS IT SO POPULAR RIGHT NOW? 4 THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT THE TOP-SECRET SITE\n\nNye County Director of Emergency Services Scott Lewis said Wednesday he is preparing for several scenarios with various severity levels.\n\n\u201cA mass casualty incident, serious traffic accident, large fire, anything along those lines. Even the potential for something similar to October 1,\" he told FOX5. \"Anything along those lines we want to be prepared for to the best of our ability.\"\n\nOctober 1 refers to the Las Vegas Massacre, the deadliest shooting in modern U.S. history.\n\nOn Wednesday, county officials said they believe 1,000 to 3,000 people could potentially show up in the town of Amargosa, which has a population of nearly 1,000 people. County Commission Chairman John Koenig laid out what could happen if a crowd that large ends up appearing in Amargosa.\n\n\u201cBe prepared not to have cell service, not to have Internet. There will probably be no water available, there will probably be no ice available because everything is going to sell out. There will probably be no gas left in the gas station, no food, nowhere to go potty,\" Koenig said Wednesday. \"If you\u2019re coming, be prepared because it\u2019s probably not going to be nice.\n\n'STORM AREA 51' CRAZE CONTINUES AS 2M PEOPLE PLEDGE TO RAID SECRET GOV'T MILITARY BASE\n\nHe advised anyone planning to visit the area during the events should be prepared with food, water, and other essential items since those supplies will probably sell out very quickly.\n\nAuthorities are also concerned about a massive influx of traffic that could lead to gridlock, stymying first responders and law enforcement if they are needed.\n\nCounty officials stressed they are worried that sources could get tied up with masses of people arriving on the lone highway in the area. Nye County commissioner Leo Blundo urged residents they should prepare by stocking up on food, water, gasoline, and prescription medication ahead of the weekend.\n\nCell phone service may also be impacted if thousands show up. Amargosa Town Board member Trevor Dolby told commissioners that cell phone towers in Amargosa were not designed to support the thousands of people, according to FOX5.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s scary is our 9-1-1 paging service goes through cell phones,\u201d Dolby said.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nEarlier this month, neighboring Lincoln County drafted an emergency declaration but gave conditional approval for events in tiny towns near the once top-secret U.S. Air Force test area. that has long been a focus of UFO conspiracy theories.\n\nThe Little A'Le'Inn in Rachel is scheduling an event called Alienstock on Sept. 20-22, while The Alien Research Center souvenir shop in Hiko has planned a Sept. 20-21 expo. Those events in Hiko and Rachel would be about 100 miles from Amargosa Valley.\n\nRachel's website says the nearest gas stations are located 50 miles south in Ash Springs and 110 miles north in Tonopah.\n\n\"Other than the Little A'Le'Inn, a small bar/restaurant/motel, there are no services in Rachel. There is no gas and no store,\" a post from the town reads. \"The Inn is booked for that weekend. If you plan on attending the event you must be experienced in camping, hiking and surviving in a harsh desert environment and have a vehicle in good shape.\"\n\nFox News' Chris Ciaccia and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "A second county in rural Nevada voted Wednesday to pre-sign an emergency declaration out of fears the \"Storm Area 51\" event next month may bring alien-obsessed\u00a0crowds that could overwhelm the area.", "authors": ["Travis Fedschun", "Travis Fedschun Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com.
