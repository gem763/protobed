Countries and peoples also face stages that resemble spring or winter in their lives. Azerbaijan was living a cold winter of its history in the warm summer of 1993. We tried to briefly describe in our opening notes the picture in the country, which had restored its state independence just two years before. As for the details, I don\u2019t think they matter. It is enough if the witnesses of those scary days refresh their memories.\n\nThe people of Azerbaijan were lucky in that they had a great son like Heydar Aliyev. In those fateful days, the people showed wisdom to invite their genius son to political power. It marked a transition from winter to spring and pale hopes started to blossom.\n\nThe great leader, who was elected President on October 3, 1993 and started to execute his authorities one week later by taking an oath of loyalty to his motherland, people and statehood, managed to overcome difficult obstacles by enduring countless sufferings. Invincible Heydar Aliyev succeeded in bringing Azerbaijan from a wavy sea to a calm harbor thanks to his iron will, determination, wisdom and innate talent of statesmanship. Stability, which was a key prerequisite for reconstruction, was ensured.\n\nYear 2003. The people of Azerbaijan again showed wisdom to elect the worthy successor of the great leader, Ilham Aliyev, their leader and the country stepped into a qualitatively new stage of development. From the very first day in power, President Ilham Aliyev declared that Azerbaijan would follow the path of Heydar Aliyev because this path had no alternative. Azerbaijan, which has changed enormously, presents its brands to the modern world and is recognized as an island of safety, is here as a brilliant example of the triumph of political succession. I would like to share my thoughts and refresh memories as a living witness who has seen Azerbaijan\u2019s progress over the past 26 years. I will talk about the most memorable moments of Azerbaijan\u2019s spring, in which every month and every year is a saga.", "description": "The picture 26 years ago: chaos and anarchy, a deep political and economic crisis, civil confrontation, instability and despair\u2026", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/16/5da6c7f8a310cf3e97a18338.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
