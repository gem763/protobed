REUTERS/Carlos Barria\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump nominated Peter Gaynor on Thursday to head the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the White House said in a statement.\n\nGaynor, FEMA\u2019s deputy administrator, had been acting chief of the agency, which oversees the government response to disasters like hurricanes and wildfires.\n\nThe agency has been without a Senate-confirmed administrator since March, when Brock Long left the post. Long resigned after the Department of Homeland Security, under which FEMA falls, concluded Long had inappropriately used government vehicles to commute between Washington and his home in North Carolina.\n\nA different nominee for the job, Jeffrey Byard, was withdrawn from consideration earlier this month, after a background check uncovered allegations that he had been involved in a barroom brawl.\n\nGaynor\u2019s nomination to the post was expected. He will require a majority of the Senate to approve the nomination to take the job.\n\nBefore becoming FEMA\u2019s deputy administrator in 2018, Gaynor worked in emergency management in Rhode Island and was a Marine, the White House said.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump nominated Peter Gaynor on Thursday to head the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the White House said in a statement.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434354324&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q02S", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
