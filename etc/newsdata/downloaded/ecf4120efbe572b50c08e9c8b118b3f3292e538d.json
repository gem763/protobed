Asia Naphtha/Gasoline-Cracks fall; petchem margin may hurt demand\n\nSINGAPORE, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Asia's naphtha crack dropped for a second day on Thursday to a one-week low of $88.25 a tonne, while the intermonth time spread eased to a three-session low of $24.50 a tonne as shrinking petrochemical margins may curb demand for the fuel.\n\n- The intermonth timespread shot to more than a 6-1/2 year high of $27 a tonne on Oct. 15 and despite easing, the current value is still sharply higher than the average of $3.60 for January to September.\n\n- Spot premiums had shot to $30 a tonne to Japan quotes on a cost-and-freight (C&F) basis, sharply contrasting the discount levels between June and first-half September.\n\n- But petrochemical prices such as those for ethylene were not catching up, the sources added. O/NASIANAP\n\n- Petrochemical margins have been severely hit and there were concerns that this could hamper naphtha demand.\n\n- Additionally, buyers who are able to use alternative liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to partially replace naphtha will likely continue to do so into the winter months.\n\n- LPG typically becomes more expensive during winter because it is also a fuel used for heating.\n\n- \"But given the naphtha prices now, it is cheaper to use LPG in December,\" said one of the sources.\n\n* GASOLINE: Asia's gasoline crack fell to a two-week low of $8.60 a barrel on high stockpiles.\n\n- Singapore's onshore light distillates stocks, which comprise mostly gasoline and blending components for petrol, surged nearly 12% or 1.17 million barrels to hit a five-week high of 10.934 million barrels in the week ended Wednesday, data from Enterprise Singapore showed.
