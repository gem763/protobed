To the contrary: The falsehood-filled tweets and televised tirades are gradually eroding Americans\u2019 shared sense of reality.\u201d\n\nThe CNN host then bemoaned Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201clegitimate criticism\u201d as being bound to a false premise.\n\n\u201cSome of what Trump posts about the media is legitimate criticism, but much of it is misleading,\u201d Mr. Stelter wrote. \u201cAt the root of it all is a lie: That legitimate news outlets are \u2018fake.\u2019 \u2026 The president sometimes seizes on ethical lapses to bolster his case \u2014 a form of argument by anecdote that is certainly persuasive to his fans but isn\u2019t factually sound.\u201d\n\nMr. Stelter then cited the White House\u2019s recent response to reporting by MSNBC\u2019s Lawrence O\u2019Donnell, which required an apology and a retraction.\n\nMr. O\u2019Donnell made a single-anonymous-source claim linking Mr. Trump\u2019s loans with Deutsche Bank to Russian oligarchs.\n\n\u201c[I made] an error in judgment by reporting an item about the president\u2019s finances that didn\u2019t go through our rigorous verification and standards process,\u201d the MSNBC host said Aug. 29. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have reported it and I was wrong to discuss it on the air.\u201d\n\nMr. Stelter framed the incident with MSNBC as an episodic problem rather than a serial problem.\n\n\u201cO\u2019Donnell cited a single unnamed source and didn\u2019t go through the network\u2019s proper vetting process \u2014 and he was widely criticized for the misstep,\u201d Mr. Stelter said. \u201cAfter a legal threat from one of Trump\u2019s lawyers, O\u2019Donnell apologized for making the claim and retracted it. The episode was embarrassing for MSNBC.\u201d\n\nRandy Hall of the media watchdog NewsBusters rejected Mr. Stelter\u2019s read of the journalistic landscape.\n\nThe NewsBusters writer called the \u201cshared sense of reality\u201d position \u201ccoded language\u201d for \u201ceveryone believes the liberal media\u2019s analysis.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
