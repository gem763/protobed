They are used to the demands of top level football whereas Rice has yet to experience this for West Ham.\n\nEngland internationals are therefore the best place for him to show that he fits in alongside elite players and can play in a team that is expected to have the ball for most of the game.", "description": "England football are expected to record another victory this evening against Kosovo, especially given their unbeaten qualifying record over the last ten years which includes three consummate victories this campaign.
