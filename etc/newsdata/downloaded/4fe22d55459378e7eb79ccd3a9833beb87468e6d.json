Korean Hackers\u2019 New MacOS Malware Hides Behind Fake Crypto Firm", "language": "en", "text": "The notorious North Korean hackers known as the Lazarus APT Group have created another malware targeting Apple Macs that masquerades behind a fake cryptocurrency firm.\n\nApple Mac security specialist and principal security researcher at Jamf Patrick Wardle published a blog post on Oct. 12 outlining the nature of the malware, revealed by MalwareHunterTeam (MHT) researchers the previous day.\n\nClosely related to earlier macOS crypto-malware\n\nMHT and Wardle have warned that at the time of their warning, the malware was undetected by any engines on VirusTotal and that the sample appears to be closely related to a strain of Mac malware created by the Lazarus Group and identified by Kaspersky Labs back in summer 2018.\n\nLike the previous strain, the hackers have set up a fake cryptocurrency firm \u2014 this time dubbed \u201cJMT Trading\u201d \u2014 through which to perpetrate their attack. Having written an open-source cryptocurrency trading app, they uploaded its code on GitHub, concealing the malware within it.\n\nWardle analyzed the installation process for the app, identifying the suspicious package and launch daemon concealed within it and analyzing the malicious functionality of the hackers\u2019 backdoor script.\n\nWhile the backdoor affords a remote attacker complete command and control over infected macOS systems, Wardle notes that open-source security tools and manual detection processes by alerted users should have no issue detecting the malware. However, he reiterated his warning that VirusTotal engines were not picking it up at the time of writing.\n\nHe also considers that the most likely targets of the malware are crypto exchange employees, rather than everyday retail investors.\n\nCyber villains\n\nAs reported, the allegedly North Korean state-sponsored Lazarus Group has achieved infamy for its malign activities. As of fall 2018, the group was estimated to have stolen a staggering $571 million in cryptocurrencies since early 2017 and was accused of involvement in the industry record-breaking $532 million NEM hack of Japanese exchange Coincheck.\n\nThis September, Anne Neuberger \u2014 director of the United States\u2019 National Security Agency (NSA) Cybersecurity Directorate \u2014 singled out North Korea as being particularly creative in its cyber warfare strategy, pointing to the rogue state\u2019s alleged use of cryptocurrency to compile funds for President Kim Jong-Un\u2019s regime.", "description": "The notorious North Korean hackers known as the Lazarus APT Group have created another malware targeting Apple Macs and cryptocurrency users", "authors": ["Marie Huillet"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvMzI1NWFlN2NhOGJkNmZlMjRlZDg2NzFiZWEwNjMwOTMuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
