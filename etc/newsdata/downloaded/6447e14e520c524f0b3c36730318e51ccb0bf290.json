Advertisers and some radio stations may have abandoned Limbaugh for calling a Georgetown law student a \u201cslut.\u201d But the CEO of the radio company that distributes Limbaugh\u2019s show, Clear Channel, says he\u2019s sticking with the conservative talk show host, calling him the \u201cking\u201d of radio. (AP Photo/Chris Carlson, File)\n\nRush Limbaugh knows the whistleblower\u2019s name. He says everyone in Washington does.\n\nFor obvious reasons, it\u2019s in the Democrats\u2019 best interests to keep the name under wraps. And no Republican wants to be the first to report the name. Rush said, \u201cThey\u2019re just trying to figure out a way to get it in the public. Kind of like everybody knew about the Steele dossier but nobody knew how to get it into the public, so they ran a scam on Trump to tell him about the golden showers story and, voila, that bogus dossier makes it into the news.\u201d\n\nEarlier today, I wrote a post about the most problematic part of Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman\u2019s testimony. Speaking before Schiff\u2019s House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday, he said he had shared read-outs of the call with others afterward. He had included this in his prepared remarks as well. Vindman wrote that he had shared with \u201ca very small group of properly cleared national security counterparts with a relative need to know.\u201d I questioned if a member of this group might be the whistleblower. Or if not, perhaps a member of this group told the whistleblower.\n\nWhen Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) heard Vindman\u2019s statement, he immediately asked him how many others he shared this information with. At that point, according to Jordan who spoke to reporters following the hearing, Schiff said, \u201cNo, no, no, no, we\u2019re not going to let him answer that question.\u201d\n\nSchiff may think he can keep the whistleblower out of this. And the reporters accusing Jim Jordan of trying to arrive at the whistleblower\u2019s name through the process of elimination may also believe they can keep it quiet. But if everyone in Washington knows it, it can\u2019t remain private forever.\n\nNor should it.\n\nAnyway, Rush said, Vindman \u201cmay be the guy \u2014 we don\u2019t know \u2014 Vindman may be the guy that told the whistleblower. So Vindman would actually be silent whistleblower number 1. The whistleblower we all know about would be whistleblower number 2. He\u2019s the guy that called Schiff. And they were all working with Schiff. And Schiff doesn\u2019t want that to come out.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, The Daily Beast published a story entitled \u201cNunes Aide Is Leaking the Ukraine Whistleblower\u2019s Name, Sources Say.\u201d The lede says, \u201cDerek Harvey, a former intelligence analyst, has also been spreading disinformation about an aide to Adam Schiff.\u201d The article tells us this information has come from \u201ctwo knowledgeable sources.\u201d According to The Daily Beast:\n\nDerek Harvey, who works for Nunes, the ranking Republican on the House intelligence committee, has provided notes for House Republicans identifying the whistleblower\u2019s name ahead of the high-profile depositions of Trump administration appointees and civil servants in the impeachment inquiry. The purpose of the notes, one source said, is to get the whistleblower\u2019s name into the record of the proceedings, which committee chairman Adam Schiff has pledged to eventually release. In other words: it\u2019s an attempt to out the anonymous official who helped trigger the impeachment inquiry.\n\nOver the weekend, The Washington Post reported that \u201cGOP lawmakers and staffers have \u201crepeatedly\u201d used a name purporting to be that of the whistleblower during the depositions.\u201d\n\nThere have been a number of recent articles in left-leaning publications accusing Republicans of playing it fast and loose with the whistleblower\u2019s name. That\u2019s a problem for Democrats because once it\u2019s known, and his or her connection (I think it\u2019s a he) to Schiff is discovered, the air will start escaping from the repugnant representative\u2019s impeachment balloon. Until it deflates just like the Mueller balloon did.\n\nRepublicans need to question the whistleblower under oath. Lindsey Graham, the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee should subpoena this individual.\n\nOne of the attorneys representing the whistleblower, Mark Zaid, told The Daily Beast, \u201cExposing the identity of the whistleblower and attacking our client would do nothing to undercut the validity of the complaint\u2019s allegations. What it would do, however, is put that individual and their family at risk of harm.\n\nWell, sorry darlin\u2019 \u2013 but that\u2019s just a risk we\u2019ll have to take.", "description": "Rush Limbaugh: Everyone in Washington Knows the Whistleblower\u2019s Name", "authors": ["Elizabeth Vaughn", "Sister Toldjah", "Brandon Morse", "Alex Parker", "Kira Davis", "Posted At Pm On October"], "top_image": "https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/AP_100101122024.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
