The summit is a gathering of investors, business people and decision makers. During a question and answer session following his address, Ramaphosa shed light on the crisis at the debt-ridden power utility.\n\nResponding to a question about government's plans to reassure ratings agency Moody's about reforming Eskom, ahead of its verdict on the country's credit rating in November, Ramaphosa acknowledged that Eskom is \"dogged\" by \"huge debt\". Eskom's debt levels surpass R450bn.\n\n\"We will make announcement on how to deal with debt in next few days. Hope Moody's will take note,\" Ramaphosa said. Government is working on \"innovative ideas\" to deal with Eskom debt, he added. Ramaphosa said the collection of tariffs had weakened over time, but new strategies and programmes are being developed to deal with tariff collections, he explained.\n\nAnnouncements on executive appointments at Eskom, including that of chief executive officer will also be made soon, and the board will be \"strengthened\", Ramaphosa confirmed.\n\n\"I think Moody's and others will be happy with announcements made,\" Ramaphosa said.\n\nHe also commented that announcements will be made on the energy strategy. \"We will deal with that a provide a clearer picture of how to move forward with energy,\" he said as he explained there is global pressure on countries which traditionally rely on coal-fired power stations for energy.\n\nBloomberg recently reported that government is considering a R160bn green fund to decommission coal-fired power stations and push renewable energy solutions.\n\nDuring his address he lamented that the power utility was struggling with liquidity problems and operational challenges. But there is a process in place to strengthen governance at Eskom, improve debt collection and increase energy availability and plant performance.\n\nHe said the planned unbundling of Eskom into three entities - generation, transmission and distribution- is similar to what other countries have done.\n\nPrivate partnerships with SAA\n\nThe president also commented on moves at the national carrier, SAA. \"SAA is one of those SOEs (state-owned enterprises) that has relied on lots of bailouts,\" Ramaphosa told the summit. He confirmed that government is open to private sector participation at SOEs, like SAA. \"At SAA we are open to a strategic equity partner,\" he added.", "description": "President Cyril Ramaphosa said he is hopeful ratings agency Moody's will take note of the reforms that have been introduced to stabilise Eskom, ahead of its review in November.", "authors": ["Minutes Ago - Lameez Omarjee"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9159/8f14f349894144a6b0732950b144f5d9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
