Note the degree to which Elon Musk\u2019s every activity is followed and chronicled, from fascinating inventions to bizarre podcast appearances. Musk himself was cited as the inspiration for the cinematic version of Tony Stark, aka Iron Man. Inspiration for a superhero: it doesn\u2019t get much higher-profile than that.\n\nThe late Steve Jobs is another example: his work with Apple and his own biography are still being explored years after his untimely death. He\u2019s also been the subject of multiple biopics, and his legacy can be felt with each new product launch from Apple.\n\nBut both Jobs and Musk have their less pleasant sides as well. Jobs was infamous for putting Apple employees on the spot in terms of what they were working on, with unpleasant professional consequences if he didn\u2019t like what he heard. And Musk\u2019s penchant for off-the-cuff statements has come off as terribly unprofessional and even cruel at certain instances.\n\nBoth Musk and Jobs can trace their lineage back to the works of Thomas Edison, who practically pioneered the blend of entrepreneur and inventor that led to fame and fortune. But Edison\u2019s public image, in the last few decades, has taken plenty of hits \u2014 notably due to comparisons between Edison and his fellow genius Nikolai Tesla. The apex of this may be a Drunk History episode in which Crispin Glover portrays Edison as a grim-faced man meticulously electrocuting animals just to spite Tesla.\n\nInto this revisionist milieu comes the late Pulitzer Prize winner Edmund Morris\u2019s new biography, Edison. Morris isn\u2019t really concerned with sugar-coating Edison\u2019s life: early in his book, he describes Edison retaking control over his business from one of his sons, and promptly undoing all of his son\u2019s work in making the company a more enjoyable place to work \u2014 and laying a substantial number of people off in the process. If you\u2019re already inclined to dislike Edison, Edison will give you plenty of reasons to feel justified.\n\nBut Morris also takes a few interesting approaches to revisiting one man\u2019s frequently-documented life. To begin with, he tells the story of Edison\u2019s life in reverse, going back decade by decade. At times, this feels jarring, but it also presents a very different portrait of Edison as the book opens: racing against his own mortality to explore a very different type of business: namely, finding a variety of rubber that can be grown in the United States. It\u2019s neither the archetypal \u201cWizard of Menlo Park\u201d or the frenemy of Tesla that have both been so frequently discussed \u2014 and it\u2019s all the more interesting for it.\n\nTesla does make a few appearances here, and Morris gives him his due, portraying him as Edison\u2019s only real peer in terms of scientific genius. He also notes that, for all of the talk of Tesla as underdog to Edison as establishment favorite, neither man ever received the Nobel Prize. And Morris notes that in 1915, when rumors swirled that both men would jointly receive the Nobel Prize, Tesla\u2019s public comment included the declaration that \u201cEdison was worth a dozen Nobel Prizes.\u201d\n\nOne of the particularly striking things about Morris\u2019s biography was the extent to which it depicts Edison as ahead of his time. He proposed some decidedly modern innovations to William Howard Taft as he sought reelection for the presidency. Edison used a proprietary technology for the phonographs his company developed. And he was developing electric cars long before the concept of an electric car was an inherently futuristic idea.\n\nMorris\u2019s biography won\u2019t necessarily revise your opinion of Thomas Edison \u2014 but then, that\u2019s not what it\u2019s there to do. Instead, it offers a reminder of why he\u2019s drawn the attention of so many \u2014 and makes a number of connections between his innovative work and the innovations taking place in the present day.", "description": "There\u2019s something inherently appealing about the blend of invention and entrepreneurship that certain public figures carry off.
