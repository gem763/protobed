The party stands to be obliterated at the ballot box if Boris Johnson fails to deliver Brexit as promised by October 31st, an outcome European Union sources quoted by The Times newspaper now says is impossible.\n\nConcurrently, reports from Brussels suggest that Mr Johnson has sacrificed the integrity of the United Kingdom to get a new Brexit deal, again an outcome potential Conservative voters would be likely to punish the party for in an election.\n\nBritish newspaper The Guardian reported Tuesday evening that a draft agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union had been agreed in a last-dash negotiating session before the midnight cutoff imposed by the EU negotiating team. Yet incredibly, Mr Johnson \u2014 who at one time criticised former leader Theresa May for giving away too much to the EU in negotiations \u2014 has made a sacrifice even she said \u201cno Prime Minister could accept\u201d, by allowing a customs border to split up the United Kingdom.\n\nEU Says Brexit Treaty \u2018Still Possible\u2019, Rees-Mogg Says Votes Are There for a Deal https://t.co/lan9cXnFub \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 15, 2019\n\nRather than having a customs border around the United Kingdom\u2019s external border, the alleged proposal that has now, it is claimed, been accepted in principle would see a border separating Great Britain from Northern Ireland, both of which are full and equal parts of the United Kingdom. The deal would prioritise keeping an open border between Northern Ireland and a third country, the Republic of Ireland, and the rest of the European Union over keeping an open border with the rest of its own nation.\n\nAn unnamed source quoted by the paper said the agreement means \u201cNorthern Ireland would de jure be in the UK\u2019s customs territory but de facto in the European Union\u2019s\u201d, allowing both Mr Johnson and Brussels to claim a victory while breaking up the United Kingdom.\n\nYet even this mad dash to get a deal \u2014 potentially at the cost of the United Kingdom\u2019s integrity as a nation-state \u2014 will not be enough to deliver Brexit on time, potentially a fatal outcome for Mr Johnson\u2019s electoral chances. As Breitbart London reported, delivering Brexit on time deal or no deal would see the Conservatives win a future general election with a decent majority, while delivering it late \u2014 even with a deal \u2014 would see them fall short of being able to command a parliamentary majority.\n\nThe Times reports that the Prime Minister has been told getting the specifics of a deal done would take \u201ctwo more months\u201d, pushing the eventual departure day into 2020 and quoted a German government source that said Brexit would have to be delayed until January 1st 2020.\n\nThe paper also quoted an unnamed EU source, that said: \u201cWithout a deal this week, Britain will need an extension. With a deal this week, Britain will need an extension.\u201d\n\nBrexit has already been officially delayed twice, those dates themselves having only come after a long period of delay. It has now been nearly three and a half years since the British people voted to leave the European Union in 2016, by a margin of more than a million votes in the largest democratic mandate given in British history.", "description": "While claims suggest Prime Minister Boris Johnson has made major concessions to the European Union in his blind pursuit of a Brexit deal, top European figures have warned a Brexit delay is inevitable.", "authors": ["Oliver Jj Lane"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1181192354-e1571163209585-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
