I am actually rather discouraged, but I have told myself to cheer up.\n\nWhat he said: In the last few weeks the chances of a deal have been rising, I believe, for three reasons.\n\nWhat he meant: Reason one: A no-deal Brexit will be so disastrous I cannot afford to admit it\u2019s where we are heading. Reason two: I am an incurable optimist. Reason three: I have lost touch with reality.

I don\u2019t think they will. I hope that they won\u2019t.\n\nWhat he meant: Of course they are going to. That is what traitors do.\n\nWhat he said: If they do they will plainly chop the legs out from under the UK position and make any further negotiation absolutely impossible.\n\nWhat he meant: This is going to hurt me more than it will hurt you. I really don\u2019t want to call an election, but I don\u2019t want to do any of the other options even more.\n\nWhat he said: And so I say, to show our friends in Brussels that we are united in our purpose, MPs should vote with the government against Corbyn\u2019s pointless delay.\n\nWhat he meant: Nobody wants a no-deal Brexit but if we could just pretend we do, I would be much obliged. But if you can\u2019t be bothered, I have another plan.\n\nWhat he said: I want everybody to know: there are no circumstances in which I will ask Brussels to delay. We are leaving on 31 October, no ifs or buts.\n\nWhat he meant: So if the rebel alliance pass their quisling bill, I will have to resign. Actually, I\u2019d rather not do that, it wouldn\u2019t be fair on the dog.\n\nWhat he said: We will not accept any attempt to go back on our promises or scrub that referendum. Armed and fortified with that conviction I believe we will get a deal at that crucial summit in October.\n\nWhat he meant: Belief! Conviction! And failing those, a general election.\n\nWhat he said: In the meantime let our negotiators get on with their work. Without that sword of Damocles over their necks.\n\nWhat he meant: A classical reference. It\u2019s Cicero, who probably got the story from Timaeus of Tauromenium. But I digress.\n\nWhat he said: And without an election, which I don\u2019t want and you don\u2019t want.\n\nWhat he meant: But which we are all going to get, just as soon as I have made it abundantly clear to Brenda of Bristol that I have been forced into it by a treacherous, Remainer parliament. So come on, you rebels, with your European Union (Withdrawal) (No 6) Bill 2019, make my day.\n\nWhat he said: Let us get on with the people\u2019s agenda \u2013 fighting crime, improving the NHS, boosting schools, cutting the cost of living, and unlocking talent and opportunity across the entire United Kingdom.\n\nWhat he meant: My manifesto will be better than Theresa May\u2019s manifesto. I will be a better campaigner than she, and I will turn up to debates and give Jeremy Corbyn a run for his money.\n\nWhat he said: Let\u2019s come together and get it done \u2013 and let\u2019s get Brexit done by 31 October.\n\nWhat he meant: Or you can vote for Jeremy Corbyn if you like and make me the shortest serving prime minister in British history, which would serve me right.", "description": "What Boris Johnson said: Five weeks ago I spoke to you from these steps and said that this government was not going to hang around and that we would not wait until Brexit day \u2013 31 October \u2013 to deliver on the priorities of the British people.
