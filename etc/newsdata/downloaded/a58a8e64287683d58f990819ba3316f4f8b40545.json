In a shocking incident, a Russian national in Mumbai was raped by a policeman.\n\nThe woman had come to Mumbai in the hopes of making it in Bollywood. However, as her passport was about to expire, she sought help to renew it. She was led to the accused policeman who raped her.\n\nIn a twist, the Russian woman also alleged that the policeman, who is attached to the Pimpri-Chinchwad police, is also involved in two murders. But, only a case of rape has been registered so far.\n\nSpeaking to a major publication, Mumbai Police spokesperson DCP Pranay Ashok said, \u201cBased on the woman\u2019s statement, an FIR is being registered against the officer, Anil Jadhav.\u201d\n\nIndian police needs to be sensitised\n\nAccording to a 2017 report by Human Rights Watch, police insensitivity is one of the main reasons women do not report sexual assault. More often than not, the cops blame the victim, refuse to file an FIR, and, in many cases, rape the women themselves while they are at the police station.\n\nWho can forget the Mathura rape case in 1972 where a young tribal girl was raped by two policemen in the compound of Desaiganj Police Station in Maharashtra while her relatives were waiting outside?\n\nIn July this year, a woman was waylaid and harassed on the streets of Kanpur. Her brother, who was with her, was beaten up as well. When they went to file a complaint at the police station, the police officer asked her why she was wearing bangles, earrings, and a necklace--implying that it was her fault she was harassed.\n\nThe brother caught the incident on video, which was shared by Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.\n\n\u091b\u0947\u0921\u093c\u0916\u093e\u0928\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u0930\u093f\u092a\u094b\u0930\u094d\u091f \u0932\u093f\u0916\u0935\u093e\u0928\u0947 \u0917\u0908 \u0932\u0921\u093c\u0915\u0940 \u0915\u0947 \u0938\u093e\u0925 \u0925\u093e\u0928\u0947 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0907\u0938 \u0924\u0930\u0939 \u0915\u093e \u0935\u094d\u092f\u0935\u0939\u093e\u0930 \u0939\u094b \u0930\u0939\u093e \u0939\u0948\u0964\n\n\n\n\u090f\u0915 \u0924\u0930\u092b \u0909\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0930 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0926\u0947\u0936 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092e\u0939\u093f\u0932\u093e\u0913\u0902 \u0915\u0947 \u0916\u093f\u0932\u093e\u092b \u0905\u092a\u0930\u093e\u0927 \u0915\u092e \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0939\u094b \u0930\u0939\u0947, \u0926\u0942\u0938\u0930\u0940 \u0924\u0930\u092b \u0915\u093e\u0928\u0942\u0928 \u0915\u0947 \u0930\u0916\u0935\u093e\u0932\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u093e \u092f\u0947 \u092c\u0930\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0935\u0964\n\n\n\n\u092e\u0939\u093f\u0932\u093e\u0913\u0902 \u0915\u094b \u0928\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092f \u0926\u093f\u0932\u093e\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0940 \u092a\u0939\u0932\u0940 \u0938\u0940\u0922\u093c\u0940 \u0939\u0948 \u0909\u0928\u0915\u0940 \u092c\u093e\u0924 \u0938\u0941\u0928\u0928\u093e\u0964\n\n\n\nVideo credits @benarasiyaa pic.twitter.com/J0FdqBR2Tt \u2014 Priyanka Gandhi Vadra (@priyankagandhi) July 25, 2019\n\nEarlier this year, a woman from Chandigarh was stalked by two policemen. Even her home, which should have been a safe space, was intruded upon. The two Assistant Sub-Inspectors (ASIs) arrived at the woman\u2019s house asking for her phone number. Why? They alleged that her car had been involved in a road accident, which had been reported at Sector 20 police station.\n\nIn May, a video of a Haryana cop beating a woman went viral. The persons taking the video could be heard laughing as the woman was being assaulted. Sharing the video here so you can see the brutality for yourself. Be warned, it is graphic.\n\nThis pathetic and inhuman! A woman is treated as if she is some dreaded criminal! Very shameful of @HaryanaPolice27 https://t.co/l2JVMaFuuN \u2014 zafar sareshwala (@zafarsareshwala) May 28, 2019\n\nIn 2015, a girl was kidnapped by unidentified goons in Pilibhit, UP. When her distressed family went to file a kidnapping complaint, the police refused to file an FIR and sent them away. Forty days later, the family of the kidnapped girl received an MMS of her being gangraped.\n\nThere are many more incidents like these happening all across the country. What India needs is a complete reform of the police force. Officers should be given sensitisation courses so that they will stop mistreating people, especially women, who come to them for help. Until then, nobody is safe. How can we be when the ones who are supposed to be protecting us are criminals themselves?\n\n\n\n", "description": "A Russian woman who wanted to make it big in Bollywood had approached a Mumbai Police Inspector for her help as her passport was about to expire, he rapes her instead.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://im.idiva.com/content/2019/Oct/iDiva_Russian-woman-raped-by-Mumbai-cop_Social_5da42e31208a2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
