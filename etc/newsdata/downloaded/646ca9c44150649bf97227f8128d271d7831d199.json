A look at the Redskins' new interim coach", "language": "en", "text": "The Washington Redskins fired coach Jay Gruden on Monday morning after they fell to 0-5. As they look for a permanent replacement, the team named Bill Callahan as the interim head coach.\n\nWho is the new man in charge? Here\u2019s what you need to know about Callahan:\n\nHe has head coaching experience\n\nCallahan is one of two coaches on Gruden\u2019s staff with head coaching experience. Ironically, this isn\u2019t the first time he has replaced a Gruden. After Jon Gruden left for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2002, the Oakland Raiders named Callahanhas coach. The 63-year-old went 15-17 over two seasons before being fired. Following Oakland, he spent four seasons at the collegiate level as the head coach in Nebraska.\n\nHis two seasons with the Raiders vastly differed\n\nCallahan\u2019s first season as the Raiders\u2019 coach was a success. Oakland went 11-5 and met the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Super Bowl XXXVII. But the following year was drastically different as Oakland finished just 4-12, leading to Callahan\u2019s dismissal.\n\nHis former players have accused him of sabotage\n\nLet\u2019s get this first note out of the way: Callahan explicitly denied all allegations \u2014 calling them \u201cludicrous and defamatory.\u201d But in 2013, former receivers Troy Brown and Jerry Rice accused him of undermining the Raiders\u2019 chances in the Super Bowl due to his friendship with Jon Gruden. \u201cWe all called it sabotage,\u201d Brown said, accusing Callahan of changing the game-plan at the last minute from a heavy run plan to a heavy passing attack. In a statement, Callahan said he was \u201cshocked, saddened and outraged\u201d by the claims.\n\nCallahan is a respected offensive line coach\n\nThough he may not have had sustained success as a head coach, Callahan is a well-respected offensive line coach known for his ability to get the most out of his players. He works them tirelessly in practice with the position group often being the last ones in the locker room. The Redskins hired Callahan in 2015.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
