Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nBen: The White House sent a letter that our colleague Jon Chait accurately described as \u201cderanged\u201d the other day, in which it made clear, in Trump-campaign-rally language, that it would not be cooperating with any piece of Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. The words \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d are on a lot of people\u2019s lips. Are we there yet?\n\nEd: Not just yet, but we could be near.\n\nMargaret: I think it depends on what the Democrats do to counter that move.\n\nEd: Today it was reported that Trump left a door open to cooperation if Democrats held a formal vote to authorize impeachment proceedings (which they really don\u2019t have to do) that included rules \u201che considered fair.\u201d The odds that this is a sincere offer are low. But Democrats may need to call his bluff.\n\nMargaret: Should it be a constitutional crisis? Sure. He\u2019s not allowed to just defy Congress, but we never move to the crisis part if Democrats just shrug it off.\n\nBen: I\u2019m confused as to what their next move would be if they did decide to shrug it off.\n\nEd: They can continue to investigate Trump without his or his administration\u2019s cooperation. Or they could just say, \u201cWe\u2019ve got enough,\u201d and put together articles of impeachment, perhaps adding to them his obstruction of impeachment itself.\n\nI know Jon thinks Trump\u2019s \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d with respect to Ukraine were publicly admitted by Trump and Rudy Giuliani. Why investigate crimes you have on videotape? The decision on how to proceed may also depend on whether House Democrats choose broader articles of impeachment. If so, that could take some time to put together.\n\nBen: If they do decide to call the White House\u2019s bluff, what would that look like, exactly? Chaos in the streets?\n\nMargaret: Throwing Rudy in jail for contempt? I do think that while Congress is within its rights if it starts having more serious consequences for contempt it might freak people out. They\u2019re used to seeing Congress say, \u201cWow, I wish you wouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d rather than exerting its full constitutional powers. I think this is a decades-old problem for Congress, but the reality is now they have to consider if more aggressive moves will backfire.\n\nEd: All I meant by \u201ccalling their bluff\u201d is holding a vote to authorize impeachment.\n\nMargaret: That\u2019s less fun than arresting people.\n\nEd: You want to see Rudy do a perp walk, doncha, Margaret?\n\nMargaret: Yeah, nobody\u2019s going to face serious consequences, so you have to enjoy these moments while you can. Michael Cohen\u2019s testimony moved pretty fast. Glad I stopped to look around so I didn\u2019t miss it. Anyway, I suppose the less risky move for Dems, weirdly, is to counter Trump\u2019s obstruction by moving right on to articles of impeachment? But then does the whole thing just fizzle out a day later when McConnell holds a fake trial?\n\nEd: Maybe. But let\u2019s face it: Barring something unexpected, the whole thing is going to fizzle out eventually when McConnell holds a fake trial. Which gets back to the fundamental reality that politics, not the substance, is driving this process. And I\u2019d guess that\u2019s what Pelosi is game-planning right now. What damages Trump the most heading into an election which is, after all, the most likely method for getting rid of him?\n\nBen: So what do you think is the answer to that question? What is the most politically damaging route here?\n\nMargaret: For whom?\n\nBen: El Trumpo, as my friend likes to call him.\n\nMargaret: Haha. I don\u2019t think they should wrap it up anytime soon even if Trump people are stonewalling. I think the drips of news are freaking Trump admin figures out and more will come forward.\n\nEd: I think the House should go through the motions of trying to secure cooperation, take its time to put together the tightest and most coherent case for impeachment they have, and then move ahead. I doubt it\u2019s going to happen like this weekend. Even in the Clinton case, where Starr did all the investigating before the House did a thing, and the articles of impeachment were like two sentences, it took close to three months. Just in the House.\n\nMargaret: Yeah, once the House votes it\u2019ll be over pretty quickly. Drag it out at least a few months, see what comes up, what case you can make, agitate Trump even more. Nothing in recent polling is discouraging Democrats from proceeding.\n\nEd: There is this theory that McConnell will find some way to make the Senate trial all about the various right-wing conspiracy theories they\u2019ve promoted about Obama, Clinton, Biden, the FBI, the deep state, etc.\n\nMargaret: I don\u2019t think that would work actually. I know it would get coverage on the right, but mainstream journalists are going to go deep covering all the details of Benghazi probe 15 or whatever?\n\nEd: It\u2019s more Mitch\u2019s style to just hold a quick \u201ctrial,\u201d pronounce Trump \u201cexonerated,\u201d and bask in the radioactive glow of his own power.\n\nBen: Haha.\n\nEd: Hey, you gotta be inventive to capture the banal nature of McConnell\u2019s evil. He\u2019s the banker foreclosing your house minutes before the roof collapses on you. Unlike El Trumpo, who is the roof collapsing on you.\n\nBen: Going back to what Margaret inferred from the polling \u2014 before this Ukraine scandal, one of Pelosi\u2019s central reasons for not going ahead with impeachment was that it would be a distraction from the 2020 election campaign, where Democrats are quite well-positioned to take out Trump. Now that the proceedings have majority support, has the argument that it would hurt them electorally been neutered?\n\nMargaret: Somewhat, but I think it depends on how things play out. The Ukraine scandal is getting more complicated by the day, but the heart of it is pretty simple: \u201cDo us a favor, though.\u201d It seems a significant number of Americans are convinced pressuring a foreign government to investigate your rival is unacceptable. The drips of new revelations keep the story in the news, and Trump associates keep saying more incriminating things. Maybe there will be a bigger revelation, maybe not.\n\nEd: The political case against impeachment has certainly been weakened, though keep in mind Trump\u2019s whole reelection strategy is to win while losing the popular vote after getting the MAGA folk revved up into an insane hate rage. And he\u2019ll clearly spend most of his time demonizing his opponent. It probably won\u2019t be clear how impeachment has factored into this, based on the current evidence.\n\nMargaret: If that central story starts getting obscured \u2014 like if Trump is able to muddy the waters \u2014 maybe it does start backfiring on Democrats\n\nEd: In a sense the \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d we\u2019ve been alluding to may just be the previous polarization ratcheted up to the absolute maximum level \u2014 short of the Spanish Civil War model, of course.", "description": "Intelligencer staffers discuss the high-stakes next moves in the fight over President Trump\u2019s impeachment, and whether the impasse between Democrats and Republicans will grow more extreme.", "authors": ["Benjamin Hart", "Margaret Hartmann", "Ed Kilgore"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/10/10-nancy-pelosi.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
