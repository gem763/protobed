And this David versus Goliath story continues to fascinate us, as it does the world. The mostly young people taking to the streets seem to have no fear.\n\nThey have utter determination to achieve their aims against the Beijing-backed local authorities.\n\nIn a word, they are going for democracy.\n\n\u201cWe are here to fight for the freedom of Hong Kong,\u201d one protester told Fox News.\n\nHONG KONG TEEN SHOT BY POLICE DURING PRO-DEMOCRACY PROTESTS NOW RISKS 10-YEAR JAIL SENTENCE\n\nAnother said, \u201cIf we still continue to fight, then we still have a chance.\u201d\n\nAfter four months of unrest, that fight is getting hard. When we were first here in June, it was a mostly peaceful protest, aimed at a proposed law locals feared could propel them into the notorious Chinese judicial and penal system.\n\nDuring this latest visit, it seemed like \u201cout-and-out warfare\u201d between the two sides. It\u2019s also kept us on our toes while covering it.\n\nTuesday\u2019s protest, coinciding with China\u2019s National Day, was described by officials as the worst for Hong Kong. Activists hurled gas bombs and rocks. Police responded with water cannons, rubber bullets and, in one case, a real one that injured a protester.\n\nMore than 100 people were hurt that day. Nearly 300 were arrested. Authorities now seem to say: \u201cEnough is enough.\u201d\n\nHONG KONG ENGAGED IN \u2018URBAN WARFARE,\u2019 SAYS VARNEY: \u2018WE CAN'T SUGARCOAT THIS\u2019\n\n\u201cThe ongoing and escalating violence poses a severe challenge to the rule of law,\u201d Hong Kong\u2019s Administrative Secretary Matthew Cheung said this week.\n\nBut protest leaders tell us it\u2019s the authorities to blame for the escalating violence. Officials have been denying permission for peaceful rallies, nudging activists toward violence.\n\n\u201cPeople feel that they don\u2019t have the \u2018safety path\u2019 to walk on,\u201d Civil Human Rights Front\u2019s Bonnie Leung told Fox News. \u201cSo they feel the need to escalate their actions.\u201d\n\nNow authorities are looking to take it further. With new protests planned, there's talk of curfews and other emergency measures, including a ban on masks used by protesters not just to protect against tear gas \u2013 but to hide their identities from official surveillance.\n\nThere's also more talk about how this struggle could go on.\n\nAnalysts tell us Beijing could be playing a \u201clong game,\u201d certain it'll win in the end and rein this territory in.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nWhen we speak to the young people, they half-admit they know this could be a losing \u2013 dangerous \u2013 cause. But they remain steadfast.\n\n\u201cI think it will make Hong Kongers even more united,\u201d one said, \u201cand even more determined to achieve our goal.\u201d\n\nBrave words.", "description": "The mostly young people who take to the streets in Hong Kong seem to have no fear.\u00a0They want to achieve one thing: democracy.", "authors": ["Greg Palkot"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/03/694940094001_6091861389001_6091861779001-vs.jpg"}
