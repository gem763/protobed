A grieving family. A divided nation. A stirring eulogy by the Rev. Al Sharpton.\n\nThe 65-year-old civil rights activist has become a constant of the Black Lives Matter era with his presence in the pulpit after police shootings of African Americans, showing up in cities like Baltimore, Sacramento and Ferguson, Missouri to comfort loved ones and call for justice.\n\nOn Saturday, the scene will unfold again, as Sharpton delivers remarks at a service for Atatiana Jefferson, who was playing video games with her 8-year-old nephew when she was killed by a white Fort Worth, Texas, police officer. Again, Sharpton is left searching for the words to soothe \u2014 and to galvanize.\n\n\u201cI try to frame a message that, as a minister, gives some comfort and meaning to the family,\u201d Sharpton told The Associated Press. \u201cWhether it was 30 years ago, or whether it\u2019s Saturday, this is somebody\u2019s child, this is somebody\u2019s sister, brother. At the same time, it is opening a scar in black America that makes us all feel vulnerable.\u201d\n\nThe head of the National Action Network, MSNBC host and Baptist preacher has delivered dozens of eulogies over his long career, including for celebrities like Michael Jackson and James Brown, but it\u2019s the police shooting funerals that have taken on the greatest poignancy. As the cycle repeats itself on social media and on cable television, through headlines and hashtags, a drumbeat of grief and death, Sharpton delivers more than just a speech to a grieving congregation \u2014 he offers his words as a balm for all of black America.\n\n\u201cHis presence brings the attention that is needed for an America that keeps saying we don\u2019t have an issue,\u201d said attorney Benjamin Crump, who has represented several black families whose loved ones were killed by police in recent years. \u201cHe brings his influence, his platform, his national audience with him when he comes into that church to eulogize those people.\u201d\n\nAt the center of Sharpton\u2019s work is his faith.\n\n\u201cGod calls on some people to build big churches,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe my calling is to help those that go through this, and if my being there and words and whatever kind of notoriety I can bring helps them, then that\u2019s what I\u2019m supposed to do.\u201d\n\nSharpton\u2019s ministering of families doesn\u2019t end after a family\u2019s loved ones are buried. Two decades after Amadou Diallo was shot by New York City police officers who mistook him for a rape suspect, Sharpton still calls Diallo\u2019s mom on Mother\u2019s Day. He does the same for many others, including Gwen Carr, whose son Eric Garner\u2019s chokehold death gained attention largely because of Sharpton\u2019s efforts.\n\nCarr noted Sharpton paid for her son\u2019s funeral. She has since lost a daughter and her husband, and Sharpton has shown up every time.\n\n\u201cA lot of people in his position, after everything was over, after the lights of the cameras go out, they go on to the next story, they forget about you,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s not like that.\u201d\n\nWhile many cases come to Sharpton\u2019s attention through attorneys or local clergy and activists, he never comes where he isn\u2019t called, and won\u2019t do anything he isn\u2019t asked.\n\n\u201cSomebody has called him to help because they can\u2019t get justice, because people are not listening to them,\u201d said Sybrina Fulton, whose son Trayvon Martin was killed by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Florida, in 2012.\n\nShe recalled the time Sharpton missed his mother\u2019s funeral to attend a rally for her son. \u201cHe said, \u2018This is what my mom would want me to do,'\u201d Fulton said.\n\nStill, the work does take a toll.\n\n\u201cSome of the worst nights of my life are the nights after I speak at a funeral of somebody that I don\u2019t think should\u2019ve been dead,\u201d Sharpton said. \u201cEmotionally, it\u2019s very, very draining. It\u2019s almost depressing psychologically.\u201d\n\nAmong the deaths that still haunt him is that of Ramarley Graham. Graham\u2019s grandmother and then-6-year-old brother were witnesses when a New York City police officer killed the 18-year-old in his grandmother\u2019s bathroom in the Bronx in 2012.\n\nAs he delivered Graham\u2019s eulogy, Sharpton\u2019s eyes were trained on the younger brother.\n\n\u201cIt took all I had to try to find something to say that we still have to struggle on, we still have to fight on, we can\u2019t give up,\u201d Sharpton recalled. \u201cBut I kept looking at that little boy \u2014 who, you could tell looking in his eyes, he just couldn\u2019t understand how this could happen.\u201d\n\nThen there was the time he accompanied Diallo\u2019s family back to Guinea to bury him.\n\n\u201cHow do you explain to Africans in the middle of the bush why this guy was killed?\u201d Sharpton said.\n\nBefore Sharpton spoke at the funeral of Stephon Clark in Sacramento, California, last year, he called Clark\u2019s brother, Stevante, on stage. As the emotional young man bounded to the front of the church, Sharpton began the call-and-response protest chant: \u201cI am!\u201d\n\n\u201cStephon Clark!\u201d the audience responded.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t tell people in pain how to handle their pain,\u201d Sharpton told the crowd, Stevante Clark\u2019s arm draped around him. \u201cYou don\u2019t tell people when you kill their loved one how to grieve.\u201d\n\nCrump recalled the scene as masterful.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know any other preacher who could have delivered that eulogy with dignity, with a brother having a crisis right there in the pulpit with him,\u201d said Crump.\n\nHis goal Saturday is the same as it usually is for such funerals: Try to process what happened and the need for justice. But also think of the person who was killed, who she was, what she was about, what made her unique. Steer people who may be enraged away from actions that could desecrate the memory of the deceased.\n\nIn some ways, this one feels more personal for Sharpton, a new grandfather and the father of two daughters not much older than Jefferson.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t even tell my daughters to go home and be safe . when a 28-year-old woman babysitting her nephew loses her life,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking about: How you make sense out of that and where do we go from here?\n\n\u201cSaturday is a test,\u201d he declared. \u201cI\u2019ve got to find a way to give meaning to that family, meaning to a nation that now has to ask, \u2018Are we even safe in our own homes?\u2019 Somewhere between now and that flight to Dallas, I\u2019ve got to figure out the words. By the time I get there, I\u2019m going to try to have some answers.\u201d\n\n___\n\nErrin Haines is national writer on race and ethnicity for The Associated Press.
