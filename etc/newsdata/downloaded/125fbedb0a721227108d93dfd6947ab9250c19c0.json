Call me naive but that\u2019s not what I\u2019m going to do.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather win it our way or no way. That\u2019s the way Aussies want us to play.\u201d\n\nAustralia reached the final four years ago in England and Cheika had previously said he would only stay on after this tournament if the Wallabies improved on that in Japan by winning a third World Cup.\n\nHis feelings may be moot, given his contract expires at the end of the year, but he was certainly not prepared to share his thoughts on Saturday.\n\n\u201cMate, I\u2019ll be honest, it\u2019s a cruel, cruel world when you ask those questions two minutes after you\u2019ve been knocked out of the World Cup,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd if you find it inside you to have a little bit of compassion for people who are hurting, just ask more relevant questions.\n\n\u201cI came here with only one thought in my mind about winning and that thought\u2019s just disappeared now. Not 15 or 20 minutes ago.\n\n\u201cWhen the time comes, I\u2019ll tell it. Sweet?\u201d\n\nCheika said two interceptions in the match, combined with one at a crucial stage of the pool loss to Wales, had been costly.\n\nSaturday\u2019s match, he argued, had come down to one or two key moments, most notably when Australia were camped in front of the England posts around the hour mark but came away without any points.\n\n\u201cI thought they played very well,\u201d he said of England.\n\n\u201cWhile the score was a bit large towards the end, it is a game of fine margins, a couple of intercepts, but we had our opportunity when we took the scrum down under the goalposts. That was the time to score.\n\n\u201cThey were deserved winners and they\u2019ll be a handful going forward in the tournament.\u201d", "description": "Michael Cheika said he would prefer to lose the Australian way, with ball in hand, than win by playing a more conservative game after the Wallabies crashed out of the World Cup quarter-finals against England on Saturday.", "authors": ["Nick Mulvenney", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442641471&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I09A-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
