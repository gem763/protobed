I'm like 'what do you mean you can't read', but that's a sign of depression - she couldn't concentrate,' Mrs Walklate said.\n\nAnd while the young girl would hide her struggle by joking around, she was unhappy at school and was skipping lessons at Windaroo Valley State High School.\n\nThe grieving mother added she has still kept Chloe's room in almost the exact same state her daughter left it - right down to a can of Coca-Cola left on the windowsill.\n\n'Every time I look at that can of soft drink from outside the house, I still have that picture of her smiling inside my head. I don't want to move it,' Mrs Walklate said.\n\nNo note left by the Brisbane teenager has ever been found, but Mrs Walklate (pictured with her daughter) said she was 'naive' to the signs her child was suffering from mental illness\n\nSince her daughter's tragic death, Sam and Chloe's father Kyle have become ardent campaigners for mental health awareness and suicide prevention.\n\nIn May, the Walklates arranged to take part in Tough Mudder to fundraise for the mental health charity Beyond Blue and raise awareness about youth suicide.\n\nLast month, Sam spoke on World Suicide Prevention Day to talk about the importance of remembering those who have died by taking their own life.\n\nThe grieving mother added she has still kept Chloe's (pictured) room in almost the exact same state her daughter left it - right down to a can of Coca-Cola left on the windowsill\n\nChloe was named earlier this year among 11 other children who died by suicide in a video addressed to members of parliament by Gold Coast woman Ursula Wharton.\n\nMs Wharton, who titled the video 'Taken by suicide', lost her son Josh, 17, to the same cause of death in 2017.\n\nShe said she had sent the video to MPs but had only been met with 'cut and paste responses'.\n\n'It's actually quite hurtful, it's taken a lot of emotional energy to do this,' she said.\n\nAustralia has one of the higher rates of child suicide in the world, and it is the country's leading cause of death among young people.\n\nFor confidential support call Lifeline 24-hour crisis support on 13 11 14.", "description": "Brisbane teenager Chloe Walklate's mother Sam discovered her daughter, 13, had taken her own life after coming home from work in 2017 - and no note left by the teenager has ever been found.", "authors": ["Charlie Co\u00eb For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/15/20184624-0-image-a-14_1572014581368.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
