It continued when they went on to stave off elimination against the Los Angeles Dodgers twice in the NLDS, in games four and five.\n\nIt went further as the Nationals swept the St. Louis Cardinals in the NLCS, and then things began to get inconceivable for baseball come the World Series.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe Fall Classic began with the Nationals defeating the historically dominant Houston Astros in back-to-back games at Minute Maid Park \u2014 where the Astros amassed a .741 winning percentage this year \u2014 to open the series. But yet, things somehow got crazier.\n\nThe Astros fired back with three straight wins in Washington, threatening to end the Nationals\u2019 season Tuesday night back in Houston. Once again, the improbable took hold.\n\nThe Nationals won their fourth straight elimination game in comeback fashion, making them the first team to do so in a single postseason.\n\nThe @Nationals have faced elimination in 4 games this postseason. They trailed in all 4 and came back to win all 4.\n\n\n\nThey are the first team in MLB history to have 4 comeback wins when facing elimination in a single postseason.#STAYINTHEFIGHT \u2014 Stats By STATS (@StatsBySTATS) October 30, 2019\n\nStory continues\n\nThe game marked the sixth straight win by the visiting team, another first for the World Series \u2014 and for any best-of-seven series in any major league that features them (MLB, NBA and NHL). That, remarkably, is through 1,420 best-of-seven series, according to the Fox Sports broadcast.\n\nIf the Nationals win tonight, it will mark the first series in MLB, NBA, and NHL history in which the road team won each of the first 6 games. #TIODI \u2014 Mike Golic (@espngolic) October 29, 2019\n\nAdditionally, Tuesday\u2019s comeback was fueled by third baseman Anthony Rendon, who himself did something we\u2019ve only seen once before \u2014 and the first time was just days ago. According to The Athletic\u2019s Jayson Stark, no third baseman had ever driven in five runs in a single World Series game through last season; but this year, both Alex Bregman (Saturday) and Rendon have done it.\n\nSo in the history of the World Series, no 3B had ever driven in 5 runs in a game until Saturday.\n\n\n\nAnd now it's happened twice in 3 games.\n\n\n\nBecause baseball! \u2014 Jayson Stark (@jaysonst) October 30, 2019\n\nAnd of course, Game 7 is already expected to feature another never-before-seen gem. When Max Scherzer and Zack Greinke take the mound Wednesday to start for the Nationals and Astros, respectively, it will be the first time former Cy Young winners face off on the game\u2019s biggest stage.\n\nScherzer vs. Greinke. First Game 7 in World Series history featuring former Cy Young winners. \u2014 David Schoenfield (@dschoenfield) October 30, 2019\n\nSo, only one question remains: do the Nationals have what it takes to cap this series, fittingly, with the ultimate \u201cfirst\u201d?\n\nThe Nationals and Astros are giving us a postseason series for the ages.
