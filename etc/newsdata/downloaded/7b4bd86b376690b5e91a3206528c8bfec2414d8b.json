And what is that, and what is the charge, and how does it stick?\u201d \u2013 that was the starting point for the whole thing.\u2019\n\nHowever, in the case of The Accident as well as Grenfell, finding singular blame is not that simple, and both have a fight on their hands in order to get retribution for the loved ones that they lost.\n\nMore: Channel 4 Henry and Alice from GBBO: Who are the bakers surrounded by Bake Off romance rumours?
