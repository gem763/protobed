But isn\u2019t penance by another name still penance?\n\nThe phrase \u2018Silicon Valley\u2019s latest trend\u2019 should be enough to set alarm bells ringing by itself. From venture capitalist Peter Thiel\u2019s reported interest in injecting young blood in a bid to live forever, to Mark Zuckerberg slaughtering a goat with a \u201claser gun\u201d for its meat, our technological overlords partake in pastimes more deranged than yoga lessons or pottery classes.\n\nRead more\n\nThe \u2018dopamine fast\u2019 is the latest such trend. Psychiatry professor Dr. Cameron Sepah coined the term in a LinkedIn post in August, and claims that he has popularized it among his mega-rich clients in Silicon Valley. Put simply, Sepah advises that we all limit our exposure to six overstimulating activities: \u201cpleasure eating, browsing the internet or playing video games, gambling or shopping, viewing pornography or masturbating, thrill seeking and recreational drugs,\u201d so as not to burn out our ability to feel pleasure.\n\nDopamine is a neurotransmitter that rewards us with a spike of pleasure when something good happens. In a more primordial era, this kept us motivated to seek food and reproduce, hence why eating and sex feel so great. However, our smartphones and Netflix subscriptions give us this same dopamine hit. That \u2018one more page\u2019 buzz you feel when you scroll through reddit in bed and the satisfaction of having 300 people like your latest Instagram booty-shot (we all know it\u2019s not about fitness), that\u2019s dopamine in action.\n\nThere is a wealth of scientific research demonstrating how smartphones and social media are literally rewiring our brains, and not for the better. However, there is no research proving the effectiveness of a \u2018dopamine fast\u2019 in rebalancing brain chemistry. That hasn\u2019t stopped California hipsters from going all in on the trend, though, with some reportedly switching to ice-cold showers and cutting conversations short to avoid the dopamine hit of a chat with friends.\n\nIn an instance of the Bay Area being very Bay Area: today was my first day in SF since moving here, and I ran into someone from my YC batch who told me he was on a \u201cdopamine fast\u201d and thus had to cut our convo short (lest he acquire too much dopamine) \u2014 Janey Mu\u00f1oz (@jnymnz) October 1, 2019\n\nAmong the progress-obsessed transhumanists of Silicon Valley, Sepah has earned guru status. But what he suggests is not new.\n\nFrom the asceticism of ancient Christianity, to the starving Buddah, to modern Muslims denying themselves pleasure during Ramadan, nearly every world religion advocates denial and sacrifice as a means of reaching enlightenment.\n\nSeneca would take long walks in the countryside to get away from the hustle and bustle of ancient Rome, \u201cso that the mind might be nourished and refreshed by the open air and deep breathing.\u201d In the 1980s punk scene, \u2018straight edge\u2019 artists avoided the drugs, alcohol and promiscuous sex beloved by their peers. Nowadays the \u2018NoFap\u2019 community on Reddit eschews masturbation to \u201creboot\u201d their brains\u2019 pleasure centers.\n\nSelf-denial has been practiced and preached for millenia, but by wrapping his message in the cold scientific language beloved by hipsters and geeks, Sepah has brought the medieval concept of penance into the 21st century.\n\nAlso on rt.com YouTube vegans earned millions. But when they quit all hell broke loose. Should we pity them?\n\nImagine if some Archpriest Ivanov sashayed into Menlo Park and told Facebook employees to ditch the soy lattes, give up superhero movies, leave social networks and periodically starve themselves. He\u2019d be sent packing on the first flight back to Moscow. With the right branding and the right positioning, Sepah and the dopamine fasters sell essentially the same lifestyle, albeit repackaged for our times.\n\nAll of this raises one important question too. Facebook prides itself on \u201cconnecting you to everything you care about.\u201d Instagram encourages users to \u201cseize the moment and share it with the whole globe.\u201d Twitter reminds us that \u201cif it\u2019s happening anywhere, it\u2019s happening on Twitter.\u201d\n\nWe may mock the dopamine fasters, but if even the committed tech evangelists of Silicon Valley are putting down their devices in the name of health, shouldn\u2019t we take a leaf from their book? After all, crack cocaine dealers make a lot of money selling poison, but don\u2019t get high on their own supply.\n\nBy Graham Dockery, RT\n\nto RT newsletter to get stories the mainstream media won\u2019t tell you.", "description": "\u2018Dopamine fasting\u2019 is a craze making its way around Silicon Valley, as the technological elite cut down on smartphone usage, binge eating, and gluttonous porn consumption.
