The law also forces Mr Johnson to ask Brussels for another Brexit delay if he is unable to pass an EU-approved exit treaty in the House of Commons by October 19th.\n\nHowever, Mr Cable told POLITICO on Thursday: \u201cMy worry at the moment is that the government might try to fabricate an emergency situation as a pretext for pushing through changes around a no-deal Brexit that they otherwise cannot secure in parliament.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a risk that we get an agent provocateur\u2026 which the government uses as a pretext to obtaining emergency powers,\u201d added the elderly politician, who once described Leave voters as \u201cBrexit jihadis\u201d.\n\nThe then-party leader made headlines during May\u2019s European Parliament elections with the colourful campaign slogan: \u201cBollocks to Brexit.\u201d\n\nThe phrase was picked up by his successor Jo Swinson who said at last month\u2019s conference: \u201cWhen I say Bollocks to Brexit, I mean it\u201d and has said she would not Brexit even if the British people voted for it a second time.\n\nFirst Known Case of Brexit-Triggered Psychosis Confirmed in Remain Voter https://t.co/lCq9ZTwmdq \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 2, 2019\n\nA spokesman for Downing Street told POLITICO that \u201cThe PM has said that what we want to do is get a deal, and get Brexit done on October 31st without any further pointless delay. Yesterday, we put forward a fair and reasonable compromise, that we hope should provide the basis for rapid negotiations towards a solution.\n\n\u201cThere is no purpose in discussing hypothetical scenarios around the Benn Act. It is without question that the Prime Minister will comply with the law.\u201d\n\nThe Civil Contingencies Act 2004 allows ministers to declare a state of emergency for 30 days. The legislation also grants the government powers to put in place measures to deal with threats to human welfare or crises that threaten the nation\u2019s security.\n\nOther Remainers fear the Number 10 team could exploit loopholes in the Benn Act to deliver Brexit by Halloween as promised, even if that does mean No Deal.\n\nThis week, anti-Brexit campaigner Jolyon Maugham, SNP MP Joanna Cherry, and businessman Dale Vince took a case to Scotland\u2019s Court of Session to try to force Boris Johnson to ask for an extension or face punishment including a fine or imprisonment.\n\nPrime Minister Johnson has said that while his government will not break the law, he will refuse to ask for the extension to Article 50 to January 31st, 2020, repeating the pledge as recently as this week in Parliament.\n\nHowever, Sky News reports on Friday that the government has told the Court of Session that Prime Minister Johnson will seek an extension if no exit treaty is agreed by October 19th.\n\nEuropean Union Could Bypass Johnson to Delay Brexit https://t.co/YRvf9RsAwa \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 3, 2019", "description": "Vince Cable MP has claimed Prime Minister Boris Johnson would suspend the rule of law to deliver a clean-break Brexit on October 31st.", "authors": ["Victoria Friedman"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Vince-Cable-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
