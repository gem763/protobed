History teaches us that progress comes in stages and this is just the beginning of a journey.\n\n\"Consequently, FIFA now looks more than ever towards a future when all girls and women wishing to attend football matches in Iran will be free to do so, and in a safe environment. There can be no stopping or turning back now.\"\n\nInside the stadium, those present were treated to 14 unanswered goals by the home team as it made light work of 169th ranked Cambodia.\n\nAn Iranian woman cheers during the World Cup qualification match between Iran and Cambodia at the Azadi stadium in the capital Tehran on October 10, 2019.\n\nKarim Ansarifard scored four and Zenit St. Petersburg striker Sardar Azmoun netted a hat-trick in a game that Iran led 7-0 at the interval.\n\nCambodia's misery was compounded by a second-half penalty miss against its 23rd ranked host.\n\nAn Iranian woman wearing her country's national colours arrives at the Azadi stadium.\n\n'Discriminatory, deceptive, dangerous'\n\nWhile Thursday's game marks a step forward for Iranian women watching football matches, Human Rights Watch (HRW) called the cap of 4,600 female fans \"discriminatory, deceptive, and dangerous.\"\n\nIranian women cheer during the World Cup qualification match between Iran and Cambodia at the Azadi stadium in the capital Tehran.\n\n\"The effective 5% quota on seats for women contravenes FIFA's constitution, statutes, and its human rights policy,\" the organization said.\n\n\"Article 4 of its statutes states that discrimination against women 'is strictly prohibited and punishable by suspension or expulsion' of the FIFA member.'\"\n\nWhen asked if these conditions truly meet its statutes that prohibit gender discrimination, FIFA told CNN: \"FIFA's stance on the access of women to the stadiums in Iran has been firm and clear: women have to be allowed into football stadiums in Iran. For all football matches.\n\nFemale football fans show their support ahead of the World Cup Qualifier between Iran and Cambodia at Azadi Stadium on October 10, 2019.\n\n\"In line with our stance, we are working to ensure the safe access of women to tomorrow's FIFA World Cup qualifier between Iran and Cambodia. We reaffirm our position that the number of women in the stadium needs to be determined by the demand for such tickets, without any arbitrary limitation being imposed.\n\n\"Further details on the next steps to be implemented to ensure the future access of women to the stadiums in Iran will follow once we have performed a thorough assessment of Thursday's match based on the input provided by the FIFA delegation that is present in Tehran.\"\n\nThe Iranian Football Federation (FFIRI) was not immediately available for comment.\n\nOn Tuesday, Iranian Twitter users started using the hashtag #WakeUpFIFA, urging world football's governing body to allow more women to attend the qualifier against Cambodia.\n\nIranians in Iran are tweeting with #WakeUpFIFA hoping that @FIFAcom could ensure that all women who want to watch the Oct. 10th game can attend the stadium. Government has capped the seats for women at 3500.@HRW thinks the cap is discriminatory & dangerous.https://t.co/K1qJ3agCg6 https://t.co/CovCbdLdiE \u2014 Tara Sepehri Far (@sepehrifar) October 8, 2019\n\nIn recent months, FIFA has come under increasing pressure to force Iran to overturn its ban on women entering sports stadiums, in particular following the death of Sahar Khodayari , a female fan who set herself on fire after she was denied access to a football stadium in Tehran.\n\nDubbed the \"Blue Girl\" on social media after the colors of her favorite Iranian football team, Esteghlal, Khodayari was charged with \"openly committing a sinful act\" by \"appearing in public without a hijab\" when she attempted to enter a stadium \"dressed as a man\" in March, according to human rights group Amnesty International.\n\nKhodayari appeared in a Tehran court last month. When the case was adjourned, she poured gasoline over herself and set herself on fire.
