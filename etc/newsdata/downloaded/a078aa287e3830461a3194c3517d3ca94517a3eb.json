We are about to find out just how true that is. With House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiBiden: Trump has 'indicted himself by his own statements' House Democrats subpoena White House for Ukraine documents House conservatives press Schiff over knowledge of whistleblower complaint MORE now directing six committees to proceed with their investigations under the umbrella of an \u201cofficial impeachment inquiry,\u201d all signs are that the House majority is on a schedule to impeach President Trump Donald John TrumpGordon Sondland expected to appear for House deposition Ivanka Trump on impeachment: 'Everything's a question of priorities' Second intel official considering filing complaint over Trump: report MORE, likely before the end of the year.\n\nUnder the Constitution, the House of Representatives \u201cshall have the sole power of impeachment.\u201d Former House Majority Leader Gerald Ford, who would later become president after the resignation of Richard Nixon, famously declared, \u201cAn impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history.\u201d\n\nBut that is neither what the Constitution states nor intends. Impeachment is a political question in that it is a high matter instead of a mere partisan power play. There are standards that the House should observe. Article Two tells us \u201cthe president, vice president and all civil officers of the United States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThere are two stages for this process. While a majority of the House may indeed vote for impeachment, the Senate has the sole power to try an impeachment. A trial presided over by the Supreme Court chief justice may convict and remove the president upon \u201cthe concurrence of two thirds of the members present.\u201d The framers purposefully created the process of impeachment to prevent it from becoming a politicized affair.\n\nAt the convention, the delegates initially voted for \u201cmalpractice and neglect of duty\u201d as grounds for impeachment, but that was narrowed to treason and bribery. George Mason suggested \u201cmaladministration,\u201d but James Madison pointed out that this would destroy the executive branch independence from Congress. Mason then suggested \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d which the convention accepted for the Constitution.\n\nBringing charges of impeachment in the House is separate from a trial in the Senate for good reason. While initiating impeachment in the branch closest to the people will assure popular support of the accusation, the House, subject to political passions, is not sufficiently detached to hold an impartial trial. But a supermajority in the Senate is still required to mitigate further against partisan House impeachments. The Senate is meant to check the heated impulses of the House rather than blindly follow them.\n\nThere have been a few dozen or so impeachments over the years, mostly of corrupt federal judges. The most notable impeachments of Justice Samuel Chase, President Andrew Johnson, and President Bill Clinton ended in acquittals by the Senate. There were proceedings and hearings at the House Judiciary Committee and a bill of impeachment reported to the House against President Richard Nixon, but he decided to resign before the full House could vote on the impeachment charges. No American president has been removed from office by impeachment.\n\nHow would an impeachment of Donald Trump compare to those of the past? His accusers hope for the clarity of a Clinton style impeachment, complete with lying to a grand jury, witness tampering, or concealing evidence. Short of such violations, perhaps they could follow the Johnson precedent of using the cover of legislation to oppose a president with whom they had extensive policy disagreements. But the model they seem to be following is that of Chase by removing an opponent because of ideological disagreement regardless of actual criminal misconduct.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAfter more than two years and millions of dollars, the special counsel investigation concluded there was no evidence of collusion between Trump and Russia, and found no obstruction of justice. Within days of the news breaking on the call between Trump and the Ukrainian president, before even seeing the transcript or the whistleblower account, both of which have since been made public, Peloi launched an impeachment inquiry into what she called a breach of \u201cconstitutional responsibilities.\u201d\n\nThe impeachment fast track in the House is moving rapidly away from a deliberative formal process and toward an impassioned partisan frenzy. \u201cTo defeat him at the polls would do history a disservice and would do our nation a disservice,\u201d Representative Al Green has said about Trump. \u201cI am concerned that if we do not impeach the president, he will get reelected.\u201d Yet if there is one lesson to be learned from past impeachments, it is that the process was never intended to be and should never be allowed to become a partisan tool for weakening or removing political opponents.\n\nAs former Senator Joe Biden once remarked about Congress reversing an electoral decision of the American people, \u201cWe in Congress had better be very careful before we upset their decision, and make darn sure that we are able to convince them that if we decide to upset their decision, that our decision to impeach was based on principle and not politics.\u201d\n\nMatthew Spalding is vice president of Washington operations at Hillsdale College and the dean of the Van Andel Graduate School of Government.", "description": "This process was never intended to be used as a partisan tool for removing opponents.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/constitution_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
