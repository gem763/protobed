John McCain (R-AZ).\n\nAt the top of Tuesday\u2019s broadcast of the ABC chatfest, the panel focused on the seemingly coordinated attacks by right-wing pundits on White House official Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who will testify that he heard President Donald Trump pressure the Ukrainian president to investigate Trump\u2019s political rivals.\n\nWith the table unified in their disgust over pro-Trump pundits questioning Vindman\u2019s loyalty because he was born in Ukraine, McCain threw a wrench into the conversation by comparing these attacks to Hillary Clinton\u2019s suggestions about Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard.\n\n\u201cWhere everyone is losing me is there\u2019s a trend in politics where people are criticizing veterans,\u201d McCain grumbled. \u201cWe saw it with Tulsi Gabbard last week, with Hillary Clinton saying she was a Russian asset. This is like McCarthyism. If you have a problem with what Laura Ingraham did.\u201d\n\n\u201cExcuse me, I\u2019m not done,\u201d McCain continued after frequent sparring partner Joy Behar tried to interject. \u201cYou should have a problem because you\u2019re questioning people\u2019s loyalty to America who have fought and served. Tulsi Gabbard enlisted after 9/11 and served for 12 months and is currently in the National Guard. Hillary Clinton is coming in questioning her loyalty to the United States.\u201d\n\nThis naturally prompted pushback from Behar, who insisted that Clinton wasn\u2019t questioning Gabbard\u2019s loyalty. McCain, meanwhile, stood by her argument while clarifying her larger point: Military veterans should never be questioned.\n\n\u201cHold on a second, just because somebody served does not ipso facto make them above reproach,\u201d Behar exclaimed at one point.\n\n\u201cFor me, where I come from, it does,\u201d McCain shot back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, serving in Iraq in a war zone as a medic and what he did as well\u2014by the way, his brother, Alexander Vindman, also serves and both of them have Purple Hearts. I just don\u2019t understand, for me, yeah, you get a pass for a lot of reasons.\u201d\n\n\u201cAutomatically?\u201d Behar wondered.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re putting your life on the line for freedom, the soldiers in this country and veterans get a pass from me,\u201d McCain declared.\n\nCo-host Whoopi Goldberg, meanwhile, jumped in and put an end to the bickering, noting that they were \u201cstarting to do that thing\u201d\u2014a reference to, well, you know, the hundreds of other times the pair have fought\u2014and needed to show respect around the table and not talk \u201cover each other.\u201d\n\nFollowing a commercial break, they resumed the conversation on whether or not those who served in the military should always be given the benefit of the doubt, with Behar stating that there have been American soldiers who have committed treasonous and criminal acts.\n\n\u201cBut for me, one thing that\u2019s lauded at my family is that my father was a war criminal, because while he was being tortured he conceded that he had committed war crimes because he was being tortured to the point of broken,\u201d McCain responded. \u201cSo throwing the word \u2018war crime\u2019 for me is something that\u2019s very intense, something that by the way I\u2019m still dealing with today.\u201d\n\nAfter once again saying she will always give military members the benefit of the doubt because of her family, McCain concluded by circling back to her argument about Gabbard and\u2014as was inevitable\u2014ultimately invoking her father.\n\n\u201cThe point I was trying to make is it is something that\u2019s being thrown around, in my opinion, bipartisanly on both sides about our veterans and people who have served and to me it is one of the scariest parts of living in America today,\u201d she said. \u201c[Vindman] deserves better respect, Tulsi Gabbard deserves better respect, the Khans deserve better respect, and my dad deserves better respect!\u201d", "description": "The conservative co-host also seemed to suggest that military veterans should never be questioned. \u201cVeterans get a pass from me,\u201d McCain declared.", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_360,w_640,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1572366793/view_83_a7nu75", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
