It was Hunter\u2019s first solo album after years of collaborating with the 2000s freak-folk mainstay Devendra Banhart. The album contained short songs (mostly hovering around the two-minute mark) that were haunting and wistful, with muddled vocals and warped instrumentation, and earned Hunter glowing reviews and a proper spot in the then blossoming world of blog-approved indie music.\n\nTegan and Sara: \u2018People never talk about women and drug use positively\u2019 Read more\n\nBlank Unstaring Heirs of Doom ends with an exclamation point, a surprising stylistic shift in the form of a pop song called K, which is based around a video game-like electronic loop, interwoven with ghostly vocal \u201cahs\u201d and twangs of guitar. The lyrics are a blend of mundane lightness and hints at darkness: \u201cI\u2019d love to see you Saturday afternoon / I\u2019d spin you out and show you what you\u2019re worth / I\u2019d love to hold your backbone in my hands / I\u2019d be your favorite cartoon.\u201d The song now feels prescient, a glimpse of the themes and sounds that permeate The Competition, the fourth album from Lower Dens, Hunter\u2019s band with drummer Nate Nelson, which formed in 2009.\n\nWhile on the surface, Hunter\u2019s early songs may appear to be more intimate and confessional by nature of their genre\u2019s styling, he says the pop songs on The Competition are his most honest yet. \u201cI spent most of my life hiding from myself,\u201d said Hunter, on the phone from Los Angeles, where he moved from Baltimore on Thanksgiving day in 2018 (though he still spends a lot of time there). \u201cI\u2019ve tried to limit myself\u201d with past albums, Hunter said. I wanted to push myself to write songs that felt a little less restrictive.\u201d\n\nHunter is more nervous about releasing this album than he ever has been with anything before. \u201cI wanted to risk more vulnerability. I feel like I got to that place.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hunter in the video for the song I Drive. Photograph: Torso\n\nHunter was assigned female at birth. In a 2015 essay for Cosmopolitan, he described telling his parents he was a boy when he was three or four years old, the fifth child in a family of eight kids, and their dismissal of it: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I was an adult that I realized there was more to that conversation than my childish fancy.\u201d He identifies as transmasculine, which he explains as identifying more as a man on some days and more as a woman on others. \u201cIt\u2019s not more toward one side of the binary or the other.\u201d\n\nThe Competition was mostly written over a period of three years, in bursts of inspiration and creativity that were bordered by difficult periods that necessitated breaks from music to cope with mental health issues. For him, transitioning was bound up in those issues. \u201cWhen I was a kid I did express my gender identity and it didn\u2019t go over very well,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cThat stuff has colored my whole life.\u201d\n\nThe album also interweaves his personal experiences with politics. (The press release calls it \u201ca pop album that is politically urgent\u201d.) Hunter says writing the first single, Young Republicans, \u201cfelt politically risky\u201d. In the video for the song, directed by Raul Gonzo, Hunter acts as a narrator, singing in a glittering black bomber jacket as a bleak, Twin Peaks-esque montage plays out. A blond woman suns herself while glaring at detectives investigating a crime. A man in a white tennis outfit glares at a woman repairing his television. The whole thing ends with a group of preppy people in red suits pledging to the American flag before feasting on Hunter, who is lying face-up on a dining table with his torso sliced open. He used to follow the news closely but had to take a break in the Trump era, so he follows journalists he respects instead: \u201cAnd I worry that they\u2019re just losing their minds.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The video for Young Republicans, a song Hunter said \u2018felt politically risky\u2019.\n\nThe song sounds like a crisp 80s dance pop hit, with all the requisite electronic synths, bleeps and bloops, but with an eeriness that\u2019s unsettling, lyrics about people who \u201cjust don\u2019t fit in\u201d and a world that\u2019s burning. Stylistically, the whole album is a giant leap away from the Heirs of Doom era (with the exception of K), and from the first Lower Dens album, 2010\u2019s Twin-Hand Movement (NPR described Lower Dens at the time as \u201ca blissful swarm of feedback\u201d). As a child, Hunter listened to mini-cassettes via headphones with a Fisher-Price Pocket Rocker, escaping into pop songs and a world where he imagined anything was possible. For this album, he says, he wanted to recreate that feeling: \u201cI wanted to write songs that might have the potential to do that.\u201d He says the ideal way to listen to it would be with headphones, to get the feeling of not being in a physical space (whereas his older, more lo-fi recordings could be described as all about physical space, with the echoes and reverb of wherever they were recorded ingrained in the songs).\n\nHunter has experimented with a progression of musical styles over the last 14 years, and The Competition is the latest iteration of that, but thankfully the core elements of his singular songwriting are still always present \u2013 the unusual chord shifts, the serene vocals, the way Hunter invites listeners to settle into a song and become transfixed by it (the best example of this might be the gorgeous song Brains, from their 2012 album Nootropics), the sense of hopefulness that\u2019s always present, even if it\u2019s nearly imperceptible.\n\n\u201cI love the textures they use in their production and the songwriting is always heartfelt,\u201d said :3LON (Elon Battle), a Baltimore electronic musician who appears on four songs on The Competition. \u201cI love working with artists that push the boundaries of societal norms.\u201d :3LON lends a vocal complexity to I Drive, a song Hunter says is about feeling rejected by his family, \u201cleaving behind obligations to people who don\u2019t love or care about you, being with and about people who do. It\u2019s a feeling so strong it\u2019s driving me. That\u2019s the driving I\u2019m doing.\u201d\n\nWhile Hunter views The Competition as an escape, at the same time he hopes its deeply confessional nature might serve as a beacon for others struggling with their own realities: \u201cAnguish is how we start looking for other people to connect to.\u201d", "description": "The singer, who identifies as transmasculine, talks about his \u2018politically risky\u2019 new album and the difficulties behind his transition", "authors": ["Caitlin Curran"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b915e96867858d5178c90e8859b19daa9f0ea86/0_300_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=13633695a2150eb4c195154f1ec0d6ed", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
