(John Spink/AP)\n\nBrian Jenkins says he hasn\u2019t slept since Monday morning. He keeps thinking about what he saw out his bedroom window after dozens of shots rang out around 4 a.m. \u2014 a teenager flailing on his lawn, clutching a wound on his chest and repeating two words: \u201cI\u2019m dying.\u201d\n\n\u201cRelax,\u201d Jenkins remembers telling the boy. \u201cAn ambulance is on the way.\u201d\n\n\u201cI told him that he wasn\u2019t going to die, and he died,\u201d Jenkins told The Washington Post.\n\nJenkins is haunted not only by the boy\u2019s last moments but by what he says he learned later: the shooter was his friend and neighbor, a Georgia homeowner who authorities say fatally shot the three masked teens who tried to rob him in his front yard.\n\nOne of the teens used a handgun to fire toward three intended robbery victims before the homeowner responded with shots of his own, officials said. Deputies are investigating the incident as a potential \u201cstand your ground\u201d case of self-defense, Rockdale County Sheriff Eric Levett said Monday, according to media reports.\n\nJenkins said his neighbor, who has yet to be identified or charged, is horrified by the deaths but recalled acting on instinct.\n\n\u201cIt is very, very tragic for these young men \u2026 to die like that,\u201d said Jenkins, who said he is acting as a spokesman for the neighbor. \u201cIt just hurts me. I\u2019m just crushed. And so is the shooter.\u201d\n\nNone of the three people targeted in the robbery were hurt, according to the sheriff\u2019s office. But one of the teens died on the scene while the other two died at a hospital. Two were 16 years old; the third was 15. All were from Conyers, Ga., the area where authorities say the attempted robbery also occurred.\n\nThe Georgia case joins a national debate over \u201cstand your ground\u201d laws fueled by high-profile cases such as the 2012 death of Trayvon Martin that helped launch the Black Lives Matter movement. Initially declining to arrest Martin\u2019s shooter, who was ultimately acquitted on self-defense, police invoked Florida\u2019s version of the controversial statute that in at least 25 states affirms a person\u2019s right to meet force or the threat of it with force without trying first to back away.\n\nGeorgia allows people to take deadly action when they have a reasonable belief it is necessary to protect themselves or others from death or serious injury, or to prevent a felony that involves the use or threat of physical force. The state\u2019s stand-your-ground law provides even more protection for people who use self-defense.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to run back into your house if there\u2019s a stand-your-ground law,\u201d said John Donohue, a law professor at Stanford who has researched stand-your-ground and gun policy.\n\nBut he cautioned that new details in the Georgia case could complicate a stand-your-ground defense: For example, the statutes do not permit you to shoot someone who is running away.\n\nAuthorities are still investigating Monday\u2019s events and have interviewed the three alleged robbery victims as well as neighbors, the sheriff\u2019s office said.\n\nJenkins said the shooter was just returning home \u2014 he\u2019s often away working as a truck driver, he explained \u2014 when he encountered the teens in the dark.\n\nA statement from the sheriff\u2019s office describes only an \u201cexchange of gunfire,\u201d but Jenkins recalls dozens of shots from what sounded like two different weapons, the second more powerful than the first. Another neighbor, Carlos Watson, told a local news station he heard five shots from a handgun and then \u201ca slew of shots\u201d from what sounded like an assault rifle.\n\nOfficials did not name the teens killed, but relatives have identified two of them as Isaiah Reid and Jaime Hernandez. The two are brothers, according to local news outlets that cited relatives and friends.\n\nLaShawn Thornton, identified as the brothers\u2019 aunt, told local outlet 11 Alive that the family is still looking for answers about what the teens were doing Monday and whether any of them were shot in the back while running away.\n\n\u201cThere are three teens that are dead, now,\u201d she told 11 Alive, standing among more than a dozen grim-faced family and friends. \u201cAnd we all loved them.\u201d\n\nThornton declined to speak to The Post Tuesday evening.\n\nSome with legal expertise weighed in to call Monday\u2019s tragedy a clear case of self-defense.\n\n\u201cI see this as assault \u2014 several crimes, felonies being committed \u2014 and the person, the homeowner, did exactly what he needed to do, which is protect himself, protect people in his house and protect his property,\u201d one defense attorney, Darryl Cohen, told 11 Alive, noting that the fact the alleged attack took place in the dark would make the homeowner\u2019s fears of a threat \u201ceven more credible.\u201d\n\nJenkins told The Post he worries that stand-your-ground laws can be misused to justify fearful reactions based in racial prejudice, as many of the statutes\u2019 critics have argued. But he said he also believes that \u201cevery human being should be able to defend themselves, period.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone has a mask on and approaching you at four in the morning, the likelihood is they\u2019re trying to exact bodily harm,\u201d he said.\n\nJenkins has watched the pain of Monday\u2019s events play out on all sides: He\u2019s talked not only with his neighbor but with a crying young woman who identified herself as the girlfriend of Jaime Hernandez, the boy Jenkins found bleeding on his lawn.\n\n\u201cI said to her, \u2018Young lady, I know you\u2019re hurt,\u2019 \u201d he recalled. \u201c \u2018You\u2019re going to hurt some more.\u2019 \u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nA white Florida man cited \u2018stand your ground\u2019 for shooting a black man.
