She came back 20 minutes later and said she was sorry, but I had to go home.\n\n'I was having contractions and had had a baby before so I knew that they were the real thing.\n\n'I tried telling the midwife that there was no way that I was not having this baby before March 15 as that would have meant I was in labour for three days.\n\nThe expectant parents were repeatedly told to return home before later finding out that their baby had no heartbeat. Pictured: Stela and her husband at the funeral of their stillborn son Lucas\n\n'I was 12 days overdue and thought they would help me have my baby.\n\n'I trusted the doctors 100 per cent so I accepted what they said. Even so, I felt something wasn't right.'\n\n'I got checked over by a young midwife and at this stage I felt like was ready to give birth and didn't want to go home.\n\n'My contractions were really strong but she said they weren't frequent enough.\n\n'If I had told them that I was having them more evenly spaced than maybe they would have let me stay.\n\n'I pointed out that I was supposed to be induced the day before, but she was only concerned about how spaced out my contractions were.\n\n'I asked if there was any risk to the baby as he was overdue and she said \"it's 100 per cent fine, nothing is going to happen and everything is going to be okay\" and sent me home with some co-codamol.'\n\nBut Mrs Ernu was forced to return that evening after 54 hours in labour.\n\nIt was then that she was told by staff that they could not find the baby's heartbeat.\n\nShe said: 'When the doctor came she asked when my waters broke and I said I didn't notice that they had.\n\n'I said I had been in twice and it hadn't been mentioned to me. She said that she was really sorry, but there wasn't enough water and that my baby was not there any more.\n\n'I started screaming and crying, saying that that wasn't possible. I was asking if there was any way that they could perform a C-section on me to see if he was still alive as maybe his heart had just stopped.\n\n'The doctor said she was sorry but the baby was no longer there and immediately left the room.'\n\nMrs Ernu (pictured with her husband George and daughter Emilia, 12) is originally from Cahul in Moldova. She said: '[It was] the most horrific thing that has ever happened to me'\n\nShe had to deliver her stillborn son that the parents named Lucas.\n\nShe said: 'As a woman giving birth you cannot wait to get that baby in your arms.\n\n'Having to go through labour knowing that your baby is dead was the worst thing that you can possibly imagine and the most horrific thing that has ever happened to me.\n\n'I was pushing, still hopeful that somehow my baby was alive. I had my baby inside me and before then I was so excited to hold him.\n\n'We were to be blessed with a little boy. Then to have to deliver his still body was hell.'\n\nShe added: 'They handed his little body to me and I was glad to be able to hold my little Lucas. I kept him in a cot next to me until the morning.\n\n'Despite everything they didn't even offer to give him a bath. A woman came in with some stuff to make memories and kept on saying what a beautiful baby he was and how cute he was.\n\nThere had also been similar instances at Basildon Hospital (pictured) previously. The Care Quality Commission recently completed a report that said the maternity department had seen a 'decline in safety practices'\n\n'I just thought 'how can you say that when he is not here, he is dead?' It felt like a dagger through my heart.\n\n'There were people everywhere trying to help once I lost my baby, but it made me really angry as where were they when he was still alive?\n\n'I would urge medical staff to treat all pregnancies with the same level of urgency and not to just assume everything will be okay, just because somebody is seen to be low risk.'\n\nStephanie Prior, Head of Clinical Negligence at London law firm Osbornes Law, is representing Stela.\n\nShe is also representing a man who was widowed when his wife died at the same hospital during childbirth.\n\nStephanie said: 'This is a tragic case of a young mum who had no complications throughout her pregnancy, but then suffered the devastation of having her son stillborn.\n\n'This is not the first case we have seen at the unit and we are concerned that there may be a pattern developing of patients whose first language is not English who have not received the best possible care.\n\n'Ms Ernu is desperate for answers about why she lost her son and we would urge those conducting the investigation to publish their findings as soon as possible.'\n\nMrs Ernu, who is originally from Cahul in Moldova, is already a mother to 12-year-old daughter Emilia.\n\nThe hospital launched an investigation into the incident seven months ago but the family claim they have still not received any updates.\n\nThere had also been similar instances at the unit in Basildon Hospital previously.\n\nIn September last year, one-day-old Ennis Pecaku died at the hospital and a corner later ruled that the unit's 'neglect' had contributed to his death.\n\nIn January of this year a midwife was struck off after she told parents of a premature baby that they needed to 'mourn the baby's death' while it was still fighting for its life.\n\nAnd in February a mother died the day after she had given birth to a baby girl, with an inquest due to take place over the coming months.\n\nThe Care Quality Commission completed a report earlier this year that said the maternity department in the hospital had seen a 'decline in safety practices'.\n\nA short time later, Basildon Hospital said they had made improvements in light of their findings.\n\nThe Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust has been contacted for comment.", "description": "Stela Ernu, from Aveley, Essex, travelled to Basildon Hospital on March 12.
