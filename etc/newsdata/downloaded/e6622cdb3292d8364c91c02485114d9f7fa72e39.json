REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo\n\nAs it left Ukraine after two weeks of meeting stakeholders, the IMF said discussions on the new program would continue in the coming weeks.\n\nUkraine\u2019s new government wants to secure an IMF program to underpin economic stability and as a signal to investors of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s willingness to tackle reforms and fight corruption.\n\nThe exact size of the program has yet to be determined but could be around $5-6 billion over three years. It would replace a standby deal of $3.9 billion that expires next year.\n\nBut a series of incidents in recent weeks have clouded Ukraine\u2019s investment climate. The central bank said last week reformers past and present at the regulator were being targeted after a former governor\u2019s house was set ablaze.\n\nThe current Central Bank Governor Yakiv Smoliy pointedly posted a picture of himself meeting the IMF mission on Thursday, saying the IMF\u2019s main \u201cheadache\u201d would be protecting reformers.\n\nThe government has also sought to reassure the global lender that there would be no rollback of an IMF-backed decision in 2016 to nationalize PrivatBank, Ukraine\u2019s largest lender, which was owned by one of the country\u2019s most powerful tycoons.\n\n\u201cThe mission has had productive discussions on policies for a new program these last two weeks, especially on fiscal and monetary policies, as well as key reform measures,\u201d the IMF said in a statement.\n\n\u201cIt also underscored the importance of central bank independence and safeguarding financial stability, as well as the need to make every effort to minimize the fiscal costs of bank resolutions.\u201d\n\nThe central bank has felt pressure from various quarters, including a parliamentary committee that was launched to investigate its activities over the past five years, and the government has publicly called for it to lower interest rates.\n\nZelenskiy has long-standing business ties to PrivatBank\u2019s former owner Ihor Kolomoisky and has repeatedly denied suggestions he would help Kolomoisky regain control of the lender, which was taken into state hands against his wishes.\n\nThe central bank says a $5.6 billion hole had been left in PrivatBank\u2019s finances due to shady lending practices under Kolomoisky\u2019s ownership. Kolomoisky disputes that.\n\nZelenskiy met Kolomoisky publicly in September and days later Kolomoisky told reporters he saw scope for a compromise on PrivatBank. Any rollback of PrivatBank\u2019s nationalization would likely prompt the IMF to freeze aid.\n\nLast Friday at a meeting with the IMF, Zelenskiy promised to safeguard the central bank\u2019s independence and supported a comprehensive investigation of abuses in the banking sector.\n\nKolomoisky is contesting PrivatBank\u2019s nationalization in court and a hearing on one of the cases is due in Kiev on Oct. 1.", "description": "The International Monetary Fund has had productive discussions about assisting Ukraine with a new three-year loan program but stressed the need to safeguard central bank independence and financial stability, the IMF said on Friday.", "authors": ["Matthias Williams", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434436006&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q0E6", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
