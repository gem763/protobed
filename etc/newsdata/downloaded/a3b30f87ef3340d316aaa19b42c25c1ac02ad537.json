It marks the latest Hong Kong-related app to be pulled after Apple removed a crowdsourced mapping app used by protestors and Quartz\u2019s news app.\n\nWhile the game has been removed, a cached version of the Play Store page is still available on Google search (at least for now). As an actual game, there doesn\u2019t seem to be too much here beyond a basic text-based Choose Your Own Adventure-style narrative that tells the story of a protestor.\n\nIn a statement released to The Wall Street Journal, a Google spokesman explained that the app was removed due to a Play Store policy that bans \u201ccapitalizing on sensitive events such as attempting to make money from serious ongoing conflicts or tragedies through a game.\u201d The game, while free, did offer in-app purchases, ranging in cost from $0.99 to $14.99, according to the defunct Play Store page. Before being deleted, the app had been downloaded over 1,000 times, according to Google\u2019s Play Store counter.\n\nUnlike Apple\u2019s recent App Store bans of HKmap.live (a crowdsourced mapping app that has been used by protestors during the ongoing protests in the city) and Quartz\u2019s news app, Google\u2019s takedown feels more in line with regular app store enforcement, although the rule leaves plenty of room for interpretation. For example, who decides what counts as \u201ccapitalizing on sensitive events\u201d?\n\nAs events in Hong Kong continue to progress, with more and more companies drawn into the conflict, expect even more eyes to be on Apple and Google as the two tech companies continue to decide what apps should or should not be allowed to remain on their storefronts.", "description": "Google has removed a pro-Hong Kong protestor game called The Revolution of Our Times from the Play Store, marking the latest Hong Kong-related app to be pulled after Apple removed a crowdsourced mapping app used by protestors and Quartz\u2019s news app.", "authors": ["Chaim Gartenberg", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-1yKnZqPPYts3MAlXkUba42Tfgc=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10801247/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0001.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
