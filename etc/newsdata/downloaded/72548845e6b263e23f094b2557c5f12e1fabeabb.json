Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez announced a package of six bills as part of what she calls \"A Just Society.\" This is her latest attempt to turn the United States into a socialist nation since the Green New Deal really has not gone anywhere, aside from the fantasies of eco-fundamentalist freaks rife with delusional climate anxiety. The key promises of this \"Just Society\" is your right to not to be fat and have perfect mental health, illegal immigrants receiving endless federal welfare and benefits, and national rent control, among other policies that would hurt American workers. In short, it basically wants to put the government in every aspect of your life and your money in efforts the United States should not be supporting.\n\nRep. Ocasio-Cortez introduced her ambitious plans on Wednesday. Here are just six plans, none saying how the American people will pay for them. Of course, we know it will be through higher taxes.\n\nHere are the six bills:\n\n(1) A Just Society Recognizes & Eradicates Poverty: The Recognizing Poverty Act directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in collaboration with the Bureau of the Census and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, contract with the Committee on National Statistics (CNSTAT) to propose a new official poverty guideline. This guideline would account for costs related to geographic variation, health insurance, child care, and \"new necessities\" such as internet access. This would ensure the accuracy of our current poverty measure, which determines eligibility for much of the social safety net including \u2014 Medicaid, Food Stamps, Family Planning Services, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and the National School Lunch Program. (2) A Just Society Creates a Place to Prosper: The Place to Prosper Act would protect low-income tenants and rein in corporate landlords by, among other things - creating an access to counsel fund for renters facing eviction, imposing a 3 percent national cap on annual rent increases, and imposing disclosure requirements on the nation's largest landlords. (3) A Just Society Is Merciful: The Mercy in Re-entry Act ensures that notwithstanding any other provision of law, an individual may not be denied any Federal public benefit solely on the basis that the individual was convicted of a criminal offense (whether under Federal, State, tribal, or foreign law). (4) A Just Society Embraces Our Immigrants: The Embrace Act ensures that notwithstanding any other provision of law (including title IV of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996), an individual may not be denied any Federal public benefit solely on the basis of the individual's immigration status. (5) A Just Society Uplifts Our Workers: The Uplift Our Workers Act would direct the Department of Labor (DOL), in collaboration with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), to create a \"worker-friendly score\" \u2013 similar to LEED certification \u2013 for federal contractors. This score would consider factors including, but not limited to, paid family leave, scheduling predictability, hourly wage, and union membership. Thereafter, DoL and OMB are to provide federal agencies with recommendations on how to evaluate \u2013 and give systemized preference to - \"worker-friendly contractors as it makes contracting decisions. (6) A Just Society Guarantees the Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of All: This resolution would direct the Senate to give its advice and consent to the ratification of the U.N. Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. This Covenant recognizes the right to just and favorable conditions of work, the right to form trade unions, the right to adequate food, clothing, housing, and the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.\n\nBill number four on this list seems particularly outrageous. This massive welfare state for illegal immigrants would encourage only more border crossings from every nation in the world. We can barely afford to help our veterans and American citizens who need welfare, let alone open the floodgates to illegal aliens who could come here solely for federal public benefits.\n\nNow, let us combine bills three and four for a moment. Under the Mercy in Re-entry Act, \"an individual may not be denied any Federal public benefit solely on the basis that the individual was convicted of a criminal offense (whether under Federal, State, tribal, or foreign law).\" As noted, AOC also wants illegal aliens to receive federal benefits. Presumably, the government would simply not inquire about immigration status during welfare applications. This creates a scenario where an illegal alien convicted of rape in a foreign country can evade detection in the USA all while receiving federal food stamps and SNAP benefits paid for by you and me. What a disaster.\n\nBill number six is also confounding. \"The right to enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.\" What does that mean? Will the government be paying for organic vegetables and giving us all taxpayer funded treadmills and workout plans?\n\nOther aspects of Just Society show her bill is outrageous as well. Rent control, as AOC advises, is a disaster. It is arguably the worst possible government plan to provide adequate housing. You can read about it here. \"The Uplift Our Workers\" act would benefit union brass, not American workers. This would force federal contractors even more pressure to join unions and fork over their hard earned money to union bosses.\n\nHer goals are to eradicate poverty. But all of these bills would actually increase poverty. Sadly, there will be many progressives who support her.", "description": ".09/26/2019 16:51:40PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/townhall/reu/o/2018/334/f79ab7d6-7ff9-43cf-ba50-963a53e49eeb.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
