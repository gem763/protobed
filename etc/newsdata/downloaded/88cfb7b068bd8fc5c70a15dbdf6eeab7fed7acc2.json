I\u2019m glad they walked some of that stuff back but yeah, it\u2019s hard to explain,\u201d Thune said in an interview. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to make amends and correct the record, so to speak, so we\u2019ll see. Ultimately, he serves at the pleasure of the president.\u201d\n\nAnd if Trump is weighing whether to keep Mulvaney or cut loose the third man who\u2019s held the seemingly impossible job, many Senate Republicans are not likely to offer the embattled aide much support. Trump himself did not answer a question about Mulvaney\u2019s status on Monday and the White House did not return a request for comment for this story.\n\nThe former conservative congressman from South Carolina has never been a favorite of the congressional establishment. He was a Freedom Caucus member agitating against the GOP speaker, received no Democratic votes for his confirmation to be Trump\u2019s White House budget chief and was sidelined during budget discussions earlier this year with Hill leaders.\n\nSenate Republicans are currently threatening to torpedo the judicial nomination of his close friend Sul Ozerden, an episode further testing the limits of Mulvaney's sway on Capitol Hill.\n\nOne Senate Republican noted that \u201cacting\u201d has remained next to Mulvaney\u2019s name for nearly a year \u201cand there\u2019s a reason for that.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always been on the edge,\u201d this senator said. But now \u201che\u2019s on thinner ice\u201d than ever.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), a close ally of the president who opposes Ozerden, said he was shocked when he heard Mulvaney say aid to Ukraine was frozen as Trump sought an investigation into Democrats, before spending the next 72 hours trying to walk it all back.\n\n\u201cI thought: Whoa. This is new,\u201d said Hawley, adding that Mulvaney\u2019s later explanations satisfied him.\n\n\u201cIt seems starkly at odds with what the president had been saying and what others in the administration had been saying,\u201d Hawley said of Mulvaney\u2019s initial comments. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful. It\u2019s certainly a distraction. \u2026 It\u2019s certainly introduced a lot of static.\u201d\n\nIn the Trump era, the job of chief of staff has not necessarily involved working closely with congressional leaders.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell prefers to speak to the president himself rather than Mulvaney, according to a source familiar with the dynamics; the source added that McConnell has always gone to the president directly regardless of who is chief of staff.\n\nAnd under Mulvaney, Trump\u2019s open-door policy with rank-and-file Republicans has become even more freewheeling than usual. Senators speak to the president frequently with no layering of staff, allowing access to a president for whom no one else can really speak.\n\nThat\u2019s been a boon to some senators, like Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who has seen Trump move his way significantly on foreign policy as the president prepares to pull most or all of the U.S. presence out of Syria. Paul said on Monday that Mulvaney is doing a \u201cgreat job.\u201d\n\nMulvaney has also pleased Paul but frustrated many other Republicans by advancing budget cutting priorities. He\u2019s done more media briefings than the White House press secretary, though his credibility has taken some hits, like when he strenuously objected to a POLITICO story saying he was advocating to get rid of Labor Secretary Alex Acosta; three days later Acosta was gone.\n\nOver the past week, Mulvaney has found himself in increasingly dire straits at precisely the wrong time. GOP lawmakers were already exhausted from answering questions about the president\u2019s decision to abruptly withdraw from northern Syria and whether it\u2019s appropriate to request political assistance from a foreign government.\n\nThen came Mulvaney with two new controversies.\n\nDuring a White House briefing Thursday, Mulvaney appeared to acknowledge a long-denied quid pro quo with Ukraine. And he said the G-7 would be held at Trump\u2019s property in Doral, Fla., setting off a new wave of alarm that Trump was profiting off the presidency and violating the Constitution.\n\nThe acting chief of staff has been engaged in clean-up duty since, hosting some congressional Republicans at Camp David on Saturday. The president himself dropped the Doral gambit after sustained criticism from Democrats and a handful of members of his own party.\n\n\u201cWe found him to be between a rock and a hard place, and it\u2019s been one of those things where he fully intended a different message than the one that came out and he\u2019s doing his best to correct any misperceptions,\u201d said Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.).\n\nYet correcting the record has proved difficult, with Rep. Francis Rooney (R-Fla.) likening Mulvaney\u2019s initial walk-back to trying to use an \u201cEtch A Sketch.\u201d The following days brought more confusion.\n\n\"He\u2019s never asked me for any advice, and I don\u2019t expect him to ask me for advice on this.\" - Sen. Roy Blunt\n\nMulvaney said Sunday that the United States withheld foreign aid to Ukraine because of Ukrainian corruption and concern about whether European countries were also providing assistance. But Fox News host Chris Wallace noted that Mulvaney left out a third reason he mentioned in his Thursday news conference \u2014 that aid was conditioned upon Ukrainian cooperation with a Department of Justice investigation. DOJ, meanwhile, has said it is conducting no such probe.\n\nStill, the performance was preferable to Thursday\u2019s off-the-cuff affair, during which Mulvaney, asked directly about a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d between aid to Ukraine and probing the 2016 election, said the U.S. withholds aid under similar conditions \u201call the time\u201d and that people should \u201cget over it.\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously what [Mulvaney] said in the press conference was a real concern because he said, in effect, they were holding up funding going to Ukraine in part based upon a desire to have Ukraine carry out an investigation with regards to the 2016 election,\u201d Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) told reporters on Monday.\n\n\u201cI guess I liked the Sunday explanation better than the earlier one,\u201d said Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, the No. 4 GOP leader. Asked whether Mulvaney should continue speaking about Ukraine, Blunt replied icily: \u201cHe\u2019s never asked me for any advice, and I don\u2019t expect him to ask me for advice on this.\u201d\n\nDespite the limp defense for Mulvaney, no senators were openly advocating Mulvaney\u2019s dismissal, in part because there\u2019s no obvious successor.\n\nSen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who more willingly criticizes the Trump administration than most, left it up to the president. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Mulvaney is in a familiar place for any politician at the highest rungs of power.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all been in that barrel at one point in our political lives,\u201d Graham said.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["-", "Sen.
