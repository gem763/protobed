The Queen, pictured here with Prince Charles in 2008, has only missed two years since she was crowned.\n\nWhile 2019 has (so far) been a busy year for the Royal family, with the recent arrival of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's son Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor in early May, Chelsea Flower Show continues to be a treasured annual tradition.\n\nThis year the Duchess of Cambridge designed the RHS Back to Nature garden with landscape architects Andr\u00e9e Davies and Adam White.\n\nHere, we look back at the family's visits to the exhibition over the past century.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/gardening/2018/04/19/TELEMMGLPICT000001749343_1-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
