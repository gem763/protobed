He put a loveless childhood and poor education behind him and went on to take a heroic part in the D-Day landings.\n\nHe studied maths and finance at night school and worked his way up to become a bank manager in Peterborough, a district councillor and leading light in the local horticultural scene.\n\nIn 1985, he bought his dream home \u2014 a light and airy modern house in Northamptonshire with sweeping lawns and a greenhouse for his prize tomatoes \u2014 and squirreled away the rest of his savings.\n\nBut, in 2007, after behaving increasingly erratically for more than a decade, his wife Joyce was diagnosed with vascular dementia and, in 2012, moved into a \u00a34,400-a-month care home.\n\nThree years later, Peter received the same diagnosis and, over the next few years, almost everything he and Joyce had worked for \u2014 the house, savings and shares, in total more than \u00a3450,000 \u2014 went on care at a cost of nearly \u00a310,000 a month for their separate care homes.\n\nAccording to their daughter, Jill Medlock, each endured a terrible, undignified decline.\n\nPeter, who, towards the end, suffered from blood cancer, would be left alone in his room with no pain relief. Some days, he would scream and scream for hours.\n\n\u2018None of the staff had time simply to sit, be with them and ease their anxieties \u2014 the sheer volume of work dehumanised them, no one was being kind,\u2019 says Jill, 59, who will today accompany the Daily Mail to Downing Street to hand in its petition \u2014 signed by more than 350,000 people \u2014 urging the Government to end the social care crisis.\n\n\u2018No one wants to end their life like this. No one wants to be alone and in pain. They were paying for it all, but they were not treated like people.\u2019\n\nThe late Peter Banbridge (pictured aged 17) was driven, intelligent, resourceful and not the sort to rely on others\n\nBut they were people. Real people who, from challenging beginnings, went on to live good, rich lives \u2014 putting more into the community than they took out.\n\nBorn in London\u2019s East End in July 1927, Peter spent his childhood being shuttled between an unloving mother and a kinder aunt. He had little in the way of guidance or role models and, desperate to get away, joined the Merchant Navy at the age of 15.\n\nThere he flourished. He was sent on special operations when he was little more than a boy, played a part in the D-Day landings, was awarded three medals and, at 16, was put in charge of an entire ship of Italian prisoners of war.\n\nMeanwhile, Joyce, a striking beauty, grew up in poverty in the East End. The third of five siblings, she left to join the WAAF.\n\nJoyce and Peter met by chance in 1955. She was waiting for her then boyfriend outside the Odeon cinema in Islington, North London, when Peter spotted her, strode up in his dashing Merchant Navy uniform and the boyfriend became a distant memory.\n\nThey married in 1956, he left the Navy and they went on to have three children, Tony, now 63, Jill and Rob. For decades they moved around the country \u2014 from Essex to the Midlands, Lancashire to Plymouth \u2014 chasing financial positions. They worked hard and, in 1985, settled in Warmington, Northamptonshire.\n\nAfter years of ups and downs, they were happy and adored being part of a community. Peter became a councillor first for the parish and then for the district, he was a lifelong member of the Tory party and an avid gardener renowned for his tomatoes and roses. Local flower growers still compete for the Peter Banbridge Bowl.\n\nJoyce loved sewing and art (she\u2019d had to turn down a scholarship to art school as a teenager because of lack of funds) and socialising with her friends from the Women\u2019s Institute. But most of all, she adored her family.\n\n\u2018She was a very loving mum with the most amazing sense of humour,\u2019 says Jill. \u2018She and Dad were happier and closer than they had ever been. They even started organising barn dances together!\u2019\n\nJoyce (pictured aged 26) was diagnosed with vascular dementia and, in 2012, moved into a \u00a34,400-a-month care home\n\nBut then, slowly, everything began to unravel. Joyce would get up in the middle of the night, catch a bus and forget where to get off. She became anxious and confused.\n\nIn the late Eighties, Peter \u2014 ever prepared and organised \u2014 had downsized, selling their dream home and buying a more manageable bungalow near by. He also put money aside to pay for Joyce\u2019s inevitable care.\n\nHis wife\u2019s decline in the early Noughties prompted him to go one step further and enter into an agreement with a loan company to release equity in the bungalow. (This involves a lender advancing a discounted lump sum in exchange for full ownership of the property, but allows the borrower to continue living in it.)\n\n\u2018Dad could see what was happening. He had already dipped into his savings to pay for his mother\u2019s dementia care, so he knew he would have to pay for Mum,\u2019 says Jill. \u2018He just didn\u2019t expect to have to pay for his, too.\u2019\n\nBy the time Joyce moved into her first care home, in 2012, Peter was declining, too. His wife\u2019s more dramatic symptoms had eclipsed his growing mood swings and irascibility.\n\n\u2018In retrospect, I think they fell ill at about the same time,\u2019 says Jill. \u2018He insisted on struggling on and was very private, but the house went to pieces and alarm bells were really ringing.\u2019\n\nBy 2015, they were in separate, extremely expensive care homes; bewildered, confused and, despite the vast fees, often neglected.\n\nAccording to Jill, at Peter\u2019s first care home (which cost \u00a34,300 a month) staff ignored two mini strokes and left him on the floor in his Y-fronts, unshaven and unfed, after he swore at them.\n\n\u2018He had dementia!\u2019 says Jill. \u2018He ended up having a major stroke and was permanently disabled.\u2019\n\nJill said: 'None of the staff had time simply to sit, be with them and ease their anxieties \u2014 the sheer volume of work dehumanised them, no one was being kind'\n\nFollowing his hospitalisation for the stroke, she moved him to a new, smarter, \u00a35,000-a-month home where the care was better.\n\nMeanwhile, her parents\u2019 bungalow was sold by the loan company for \u00a3250,000.\n\nJoyce was moved between three care homes. The first, a Bupa home, started well but, after three years, a combination of cutbacks and Joyce\u2019s medical needs made it unsuitable.\n\n\u2018She was neglected \u2014 left with soiled pads and without pain relief,\u2019 says Jill, who is disabled herself. \u2018I practically lived there, but I felt so impotent.\u2019\n\nThe two subsequent homes were more expensive \u2014 nearly \u00a35,000 a month \u2014 but not much better.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not the staff, it\u2019s the system,\u2019 says Jill. \u2018There is no time for human kindness. When you have dementia, you are constantly anxious but no one is holding your hand. No one is sitting with you. It is utterly inhumane to leave patients alone in a room.\u2019\n\nSadly death, when it came, was not peaceful. Peter passed away in December 2016, aged 89.\n\n\u2018He died in extreme pain,\u2019 says Jill. \u2018He had lost the ability to swallow, he was screaming in pain from the cancer, and the trauma triggered his war memories. He thought he\u2019d been bombed.\u2019\n\nJoyce followed on Good Friday, 2018. She was 92.\n\nIn both cases, Jill had to plead and eventually make a spectacle of herself in the care home corridors for them to be given intravenous morphine to ease their pain.\n\nIn total, their care cost more than \u00a3450,000 \u2014 all bar \u00a330,000 of the Banbridges\u2019 life savings.\n\n\u2018No one deserves to die like this,\u2019 says Jill. \u2018But particularly not when you\u2019re paying so much.\u2019", "description": "Jill Medlock, 59, said her parents, Peter and Joyce Banbridge,\u00a0endured a terrible decline in separate care homes.
