Miller says \"a partisan hit-job does not make you a whistleblower just because you go through the whistleblower protection act.\" pic.twitter.com/nkG2o3ksth \u2014 FoxNewsSunday (@FoxNewsSunday) September 29, 2019\n\nIn his Fox appearance, Miller dodged several questions from host Chris Wallace about allegations surrounding the president\u2019s actions, such as Trump\u2019s decision to use not the federal government but rather his personal attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani, to obtain information on the activities of former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine.\n\nMiller also declined to answer when asked by Wallace to outline how, in his view, the Bidens broke any laws.\n\nHunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine\u2019s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment. Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation.\n\nAs vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases. At the time, the investigation into Burisma was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.\n\nHouse Democrats have begun an impeachment inquiry into Trump\u2019s actions following the release last week of the whistleblower complaint as well as a rough transcript of a July phone call in which Trump repeatedly urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden.\n\nAmong those expressing alarm Sunday was Bossert, a rare official with ties to Trump to venture criticism of the president.\n\nBossert said he was \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by the implications of Trump\u2019s call to Zelensky and strongly criticized the president for seemingly furthering an unfounded theory that cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike played a role in shielding emails sent by Trump\u2019s 2016 Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, and circulating allegations of Russian hacking.\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community has concluded that the Russians did, in fact, hack Democratic sources in an effort to swing the election to Trump.\n\n\u201cThat conspiracy theory has got to go,\u201d Bossert said on ABC News\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d explaining that Trump was motivated to spread the \u201ccompletely debunked\u201d theory because he had \u201cnot gotten his pound of flesh yet\u201d over accusations that he had Russian help in winning the 2016 election. \u201cThey have to stop with that. It cannot continue to be repeated in our discourse. \u2026 If he continues to focus on that white whale, it\u2019s going to bring him down.\u201d\n\nBut Bossert said he was not convinced that Trump had leveraged U.S. aid to Ukraine for political dirt, noting that the president had other potential legitimate reasons to withhold the aid.\n\n\u201cI hope that everyone can sift through the evidence and be very careful, as I\u2019ve seen a lot of rush to judgment this week,\u201d he said. \u201cThat said, it is a bad day and a bad week for this president and for this country if he is asking for political dirt on an opponent.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, both sides dug in as the scrutiny on the president intensifies.\n\nIn a combative appearance on \u201cThis Week,\u201d Giuliani used the platform to air uncorroborated allegations that the Ukrainian government conspired with the administration of then-President Barack Obama and Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign to surface information damaging to Trump in the midst of the 2016 presidential election, as well as allegations of corruption surrounding the activities of Hunter Biden.\n\nGiuliani is named in the whistleblower complaint and in Trump\u2019s phone call with Zelensky as being a key intermediary in a back-channel effort to dig up evidence on those allegations.\n\n\u201cI am proud of what I did,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cAnd I am proud of having uncovered what will turn out to be a massive pay-for-play scheme.\u201d\n\nHost George Stephanopoulous challenged Giuliani throughout the interview, questioning claims from Giuliani that have been contradicted elsewhere.\n\nAt one point, when asked whether he would cooperate with the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s probe, Giuliani initially said he would not unless its leadership changed \u2014 calling the panel\u2019s chairman, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), \u201cillegitimate\u201d and accusing him of having \u201calready prejudged the case.\u201d\n\nBut Giuliani then backtracked and said he would \u201cconsider it,\u201d based on the direction of Trump: \u201cI have to be guided by my client, frankly,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cI\u2019m a lawyer. It\u2019s his privilege, not mine. If he decides that he wants me to testify, of course I\u2019ll testify.\u201d\n\nSchiff, appearing in a separate \u201cThis Week\u201d interview, disputed Giuliani\u2019s characterization.\n\n\u201cHe seems to think that I\u2019m the judge and jury here. My role here is to do the investigation, to make sure the facts some out,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cWhat we have seen already is damning.\u201d\n\nSchiff added that his panel has reached an agreement to secure testimony from the whistleblower and expects to hear from the individual \u201cvery soon\u201d pending the granting of a security clearance.\n\nGiuliani was more subdued in a separate appearance on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cSunday Morning Futures,\u201d during which host Maria Bartiromo pressed him on criticism from some Republicans that his frequent television appearances were not helping the president.\n\n\u201cWhat am I supposed to do, keep silent?\u201d Giuliani asked.\n\nRepublicans on the Sunday morning news shows also redoubled their efforts to discredit the unidentified whistleblower and sought to keep the focus on the Bidens.\n\nOn CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d Rep. Jim Jordan (Ohio), the ranking Republican on the House Oversight Committee, referred to an initial finding by the intelligence community inspector general stating that while the complaint was credible, the whistleblower had an \u201carguable political bias.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe had no firsthand knowledge \u2026 and he has a political bias,\u2019\u2019 Jordan said. \u201cThat should tell us something about this guy who came forward with this claim.\u2019\u2019\n\nOn \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Miller disputed the use of the word \u201cwhistleblower\u201d to describe the person who raised the alarm about Trump\u2019s actions. He argued that \u201cthis is a deep-state operative, pure and simple\u201d \u2014 even though Trump\u2019s acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, said in congressional testimony last week that he believes the whistleblower \u201cis operating in good faith and has followed the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s unfortunate that the media continues to describe this individual as a whistleblower, an honorific that this individual most certainly does not deserve,\u201d Miller said. \u201cA partisan hit job does not make you a whistleblower just because you go through the Whistleblower Protection Act.\u201d\n\nMiller also echoed Trump\u2019s suggestion that \u201cthe behavior of this individual is close to a spy.\u201d And he dismissed the whistleblower complaint as a \u201cseven-page little Nancy Drew novel.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt drips with condescension, righteous indignation and contempt for the president,\u201d he said.\n\nDemocrats argued that the documents released by the Trump administration last week reveal that the president was misusing his office.\n\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said the president\u2019s call clearly showed an abuse of power that justified impeachment proceedings. In an appearance on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d he invoked a line from \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d saying Trump used a \u201chigh-pressure tactic\u2019\u2019 by asking for an investigation of the Bidens.\n\n\u201cIt was an offer that the Ukrainian president could not refuse,\u2019\u2019 Jeffries said.", "description": "The White House senior adviser defended Trump after the release of a whistleblower report that claimed Trump misused his office for personal gain, endangered national security and tried to keep it a secret.", "authors": ["Felicia Sonmez", "National Reporter On The Washington Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "Mike Debonis", "Congressional Reporter Covering The House Of Representatives", "Christopher Rowland", "Business Reporter Focused On The Health-Care Economy'S Effects On Patient Health", "Costs", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Zeayv_aiufvmKKXzaSVEuD-Zi24=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UUR5FES63AI6TH7SVPEYJXE65Q.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
