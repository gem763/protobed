They do not recognise dual nationality.\n\nNew charges\n\nLast month, they filed additional charges of \"spreading propaganda\" and will present her in court again on Sunday.\n\nHer case has become highly politicised, especially after a \"slip of the tongue\" by Johnson last month when he stated that Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been training journalists in Iran, which has been used by the Iranian authorities to help justify the new charges.\n\n\n\nHusband Richard Ratcliffe, who had lobbied to join Johnson on the visit, has raised concerns about his wife's mental health, citing the mounting toll of her prolonged incarceration in Tehran's notorious Evin prison.\n\nThe BBC urged Johnson to raise their complaints about \"harassment and prosecution\" of their Persian-language staff living abroad.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Britain's foreign minister Boris Johnson is to press for the release of British-Iranian woman Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe while visiting Iran.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6830/d03202af27ec4518847e32af0ce08695.jpg", "published_at": "2017-12-09"}
