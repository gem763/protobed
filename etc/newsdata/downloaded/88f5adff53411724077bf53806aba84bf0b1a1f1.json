But that was 1999: to borrow a line from Leonard Cohen, Cher was just a kid in her early 50s. Two decades later, she has sharpened up her act no end.\n\nAt 73, everything about her is improbable. Her face is flawless, and not in a weird way. Her figure can carry off anything, including virtually nothing. Her voice is a bellow that\u2019s somehow still feminine.\n\nBut the real miracle is that she has gone from a mediocre performer to a masterly one.\n\nAt 73, everything about Cher is improbable. Her face is flawless, and not in a weird way and her figure can carry off anything, including virtually nothing\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t even like her music,\u2019 said a man at North Greenwich station. \u2018I just love her.\u2019 He spoke for 20,000 others. In half a century, Cher has recorded about six classic songs, three of which are borrowed from Abba.\n\nSo she relies heavily on her designers.\n\nThe costumes are sparkling enough \u2013 ice-blue leotard, pink pantaloons, purple velvet jumpsuit \u2013 but the sets are gobsmacking. Every ten minutes another world is deftly conjured up, whether it\u2019s ancient Egypt or the swinging Sixties.\n\nThe whole evening is a feast for the iPhones.\n\nIT'S A FACT A doll version of Cher with 'growing hair' became the top-selling doll of 1976, beating the usual bestseller, Barbie.\n\nCher wears so many wigs, from blue to blonde and back to black, that they have their own dressing-room. Her one anecdote, about turning 40, is so long-winded that you wonder if she secretly longs to be Ronnie Corbett.\n\nBut it\u2019s endearing, because the jokes are on her. Age could easily be the elephant in the room; instead, the only elephant is the one she rides back on stage at the beginning of act two.\n\nIt\u2019s not an emotional evening: the only moment that touches the heart is when she sings I Got You Babe, as Cher reunites with Sonny, looming above her on the big screen.\n\nBut the rest, even all the filler, is fun. And there\u2019s something inspiring in Cher\u2019s determination to defy the years. By the time she sings If I Could Turn Back Time, she has already done so.\n\nTHIS WEEK'S CD RELEASES\n\nBy Adam Woods\n\nJeff Lynne's ELO From Out Of Nowhere Out Friday\n\nRating:\n\nJeff Lynne and a 13-piece ELO played Wembley in 2017 and have since toured the Western world, the Brummie having been lured out of LA seclusion by the discovery of enormous affection for his Seventies hits. Lynne still has the ability to conjure up that decade at will, his melody-saturated songs eternally nostalgic for Abbey Road, early rock \u2019n\u2019 roll and the ballads of Roy Orbison\n\nThe Rolling Stones Let It Bleed Out Friday\n\nRating:\n\nWhen 1972\u2019s muddy Stones masterpiece Exile On Main Street and 1978\u2019s spirited Some Girls got the reissue treatment, it was with a disc of unreleased material each. Let It Bleed, from 1969, contains some of the Stones\u2019 best moments \u2013 Gimme Shelter, You Can\u2019t Always Get What You Want \u2013 but this remastered version considers that to be enough. Why not clear out the archives?\n\nMichael Kiwanuka Kiwanuka Out Friday\n\nRating:\n\nWhen Michael Kiwanuka won the BBC\u2019s Sound Of 2012 poll, it was as a troubadour splicing soul and folk. For his third album, producer Danger Mouse fits him with deep fuzz-guitar grooves, Afrobeat drums and gospel choirs and strings. Kiwanuka\u2019s wise, sober songs and resonant voice make him a compelling focal point on a powerful soul record\n\nStereophonics Kind Out now\n\nRating:", "description": "I went to see Cher once in London and she was terrible - bombastic to the point of boredom.
