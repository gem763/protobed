The 10 candidates discussed their aggressive environmental proposals to wean America off fossil fuels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMassachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would, \u201cattack the corruption in Washington that keeps Washington working for these big fossil fuel companies.\u201d While California Senator Kamala Harris touted her lawsuit against Exxon Mobil while she was the state\u2019s attorney general indicating that she would continue to aggressively pursue oil companies.\n\n\u201cThey are causing harm and death in communities, and there has been no accountability,\u201d Harris said at the town hall.\n\nFossil fuel, which consists of coal, oil and natural gas, provides 80% of the world\u2019s energy, according to Ebell. Oil provides the energy for 90% of the air and land transportation.\n\n\u201cI think the problem with this demonization of the fossil fuel industry and the oil industry, in particular, is that the CEOs of the big oil companies don't do a very good job of defending their own industry and what it provides the benefits and the amazing benefits it provides for humankind,\u201d he said.\n\nEbell said that it will be interesting to see how the public reacts to the Democratic presidential candidates' push to square off the sources that provide the majority of the world\u2019s energy.\n\n\u201cWe should all be willing to pay thousands of dollars more per year for transportation and for our electric bills in our houses,\u201d he said if Democrats get their way. \u201cI know people say that they want to do something about climate change but they don't really see that they ought to be paying thousands of dollars a year a year to do it.\u201d\n\nDespite the prediction, drivers are seeing much lower prices at the pump. The national average is $2.57, that's 26-cents cheaper than a year ago, according to AAA.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Consumers could be in for rude awakening at the gas pump if anti-fracking advocates get their way.", "authors": ["Henry Fernandez"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/gas-station-customer-money.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
