(AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli)\n\nCalifornia\u2019s bullet train won\u2019t be carrying passengers anytime soon, but it has one practical use: It\u2019s a tangible illustration of what happens when political folly and empire building meet reality.\n\nIn 2008, California voters approved the bullet train by ballot measure. The initial cost estimate was $33.6 billion, with the train running by 2029. In the state\u2019s voter guide, project supporters made a tantalizing pitch. The train would allow people to \u201ctravel from Los Angeles to San Francisco in about two-and-a-half hours for about $50 a person,\u201d they wrote.\n\nOf course, the cost overruns began soon after, eventually ballooning to $77 billion in 2018. That was enough for newly elected Gov. Gavin Newsom. Earlier this year, he announced the project was moving forward on a reduced scale. It\u2019s now supposed to run from Merced, population 83,000, to Bakersfield, population 381,000. That doesn\u2019t have quite the same ring as a line connecting Los Angeles and San Francisco.\n\nThis 119-mile project will cost $20 billion \u2014 pending future cost overruns. For perspective, Nevada\u2019s two-year general fund budget is around $9 billion.\n\nLast month, the L.A. Times had a long piece detailing the ins and outs of this fiasco. Despite the ability to use eminent domain to condemn land, the California High-Speed Rail Authority still needs to acquire hundreds of plots of parcels. It also must manage the land it has already acquired.\n\n\u201cIt owns toxic waste sites, vacant lots and rental homes,\u201d Ralph Vartabedian wrote in the Times. \u201cThe California High-Speed Rail Authority is now a player in the agriculture industry with at least 466 acres of land under cultivation, a side effect of having to purchase entire fields just to acquire a corner for the rail route.\u201d\n\nAn official with a contracting company working on the project has said the authority has delayed its efforts 48 times. The company is considering asking for up to $600 million in delay claims, in addition to what the state has already paid out for past delays. These bureaucratic hiccups will double the cost of its original $1 billion contract. Also, one of its consultants has been suspended from the project because of an ongoing state ethics investigation.\n\n\u201cI am going to ride this train, but I am afraid it is going to be my ashes in an urn,\u201d one middle manager on the project told the Times. \u201cI told my kids to take my ashes on the bullet train.\u201d\n\nWhat a perfect encapsulation of this government boondoggle.", "description": "California\u2019s bullet train won\u2019t be carrying passengers anytime soon, but it has one practical use.
