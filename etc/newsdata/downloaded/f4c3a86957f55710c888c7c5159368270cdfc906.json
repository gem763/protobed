You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nI was brought up in a street housing hardworking miners spending their days down the pit and their precious days off playing cricket for the local team.\n\nThese were good living people who like most with young families now, try to instil some discipline and responsibility in their everyday lives.\n\nYes times have changed but not where real care exists. Is it not time for serious condemnation of Johnson\u2019s behaviour.\n\nMillions of lives have been sacrificed to protect this country and its people and we have prospered.\n\nI now listen to this would-be leader and weep for all those who worked so hard for Britain to prosper. Do we really want this ambitious would-be leader?\n\nI think not.\n\nBetty Davies\n\nNottingham\n\nPerplexed and angry\n\n\"Corbyn to step down as leader if Labour doesn\u2019t win general election\u201d (11 Oct): perhaps so, but why, John McDonnell, bring up that possibility at this time? And why in an interview with Alistair Campbell, someone who has been one of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s constant detractors (to put it mildly)?\n\nThis will, as John must know, provide more fuel for Tony Blair, and his former ministers lording it in \u2019the other place\u2019, to add fuel to the bonfire they have been painstakingly fashioning underneath the leftward progress of the Labour party since 2015.\n\nThe strange decision by the shadow chancellor to back the return to the party of Blair\u2019s spin-doctor in light of the toxic episode of his vote for the Lib Dems in the European elections, straightforwardly in defiance of party rules, leaves me perplexed and angry.\n\nEddie Dougall\n\nBury St Edmunds\n\nExtinction Rebellion deserve praise\n\nLet's hear it for James Brown and Phil Kingston, and all the other brave people around the world trying to get some real action out of our governments.\n\nJames Brown put it in a nutshell: \"They declare a climate emergency and then do nothing about it.\u201d\n\nIt's somewhat ironic that Laurence Taylor commented that the protesters' actions were \"wholly unacceptable and irresponsible\". The real irresponsibility is the inaction of our government over the existential threat the world is facing.\n\nThank you, Extinction Rebellion!\n\nLynda Newbery\n\nBristol\n\nCriminal damage to the economy\n\nHow does a sophisticated, advanced economy decide that it's better to pay administration costs of \u00a311 Billion a year to generate substantially less trade than paying the EU \u00a39 Billion a year with a rebate of about \u00a34 Billion?\n\n'Spin' is the answer. It was Theresa may who declared that Brexit is about more than just money. Nonsense! It's a financial decision that affects the well-being of all of us.\n\nThe only reason it's not seen to be stupidity is because it will remove our workers rights and eventually lead to lowering business costs, making the wealthy more wealthy, while the poorest struggle more just to survive.\n\nIt's about time we had a full costing for this ridiculous act of self sabotage.\n\nNo amount of 'spin' can hide the harsh realities that our collective well-being depends upon.\n\nBrexit is severe criminal damage to our economy.\n\nMichael Cunliffe\n\nIlkley\n\nTurkey's unjust war\n\nDespite the fact that war is never a solution, different states are using this tool to ensure their power. Recently, Turkey has done so by invading Syria, leading to bloodshed.\n\nThese initial battles, have claimed tens of deaths from both sides.\n\nUnfortunately the UN, as usual, is playing no effective role in trying to craft a ceasefire. There have only been rare occasions on which the UN has responded and resolved such issues in its lifetime, therefore, the UN should cease its operations.\n\nThe civilised world should raise their voices and put pressure on the Turkish government to stop this brutal massacre in Syria.\n\nSami Sahil Baloch\n\nBalochistan, Pakistan\n\nA disastrous move\n\nBoris Johnson has stated that he would never do anything which would damage the ability of the whole of the UK to take full advantage of Brexit.\n\nCan any one of the ideologically driven proponents of such a disastrous move provide just one evidence based example of these advantages?\n\nG Forward\n\nStirling", "description": "Like many I am deeply disturbed by the damage Boris Johnson is doing to the reputation of our ministers and to our parliament and the Queen. \u00a0 I'm aware that the news media must be guarded in its comments is it not now the time to condemn in no uncertain terms the damage Johnson is doing to the hardworking good people trying to ensure good living standards for\u00a0their families.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/09/16/Boris-Johnson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
