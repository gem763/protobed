Storment and his naturopathic doctor wife Jessica Brandes shared 8-year-old twin boys, Wiley and Oliver, and adored their life in Portland as a family of four.\n\nHowever, their lives were flipped upside down last month when Brandes discovered her son lifeless in his bed and was then forced to tell her husband \u2014 in a phone call that no parent should ever have to make \u2014 that Wylie was dead.\n\nThe heartbreaking events that transpired were detailed in respective essays on Storment and Brandes\u2019 LinkedIns \u2014 an appropriate medium for the successful couple who admitted that they regretted working often and urged others not to miss out on precious time with their children.\n\n\u201cHug your kids. Don\u2019t work too late. A lot of the things you are likely spending your time on you\u2019ll regret once you no longer have the time,\u201d Storment wrote. \u201cIf there\u2019s any lesson to take away from this, it\u2019s to remind others (and myself) not to miss out on the things that matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019ve learned anything at all, it\u2019s that life is fragile and time really can be so cruelly short,\u201d Brandes wrote in her post. \u201cWe wish a lot of things were different, but mostly we wish we\u2019d had more time. If you are a parent and have any capacity to spend more time with your kids, do.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Disney Actor Cameron Boyce\u2019s Parents Speak Out About His Tragic Death: \u2018He Is Our Shooting Star\u2019\n\nStorment began his emotional essay, which was published last Tuesday and has since gone viral, by revealing that in the same month he welcomed his sons eight years ago, he also founded his financial analysis company, Cloudability.\n\nThe company was acquired three months ago, and approximately three weeks ago, Storment said he learned the devastating news that he had lost his son.\n\n\u201cWhen I got the call I was sitting in a conference room with 12 people at our Portland office talking about PTO policies,\u201d he recalled. \u201cMinutes earlier, I had admitted to the group that in the last 8 years I\u2019d not taken more than a contiguous week off.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy wife and I have an agreement that when one of us calls, the other answers. So when the phone rang I stood up and walked to the conference room door immediately,\u201d Storment continued.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Bode Miller\u2019s Wife Speaks Out After Toddler\u2019s Death: \u2018I Pray No Other Parent Feels This Pain\u2019\n\nThe phone call was \u201cicy and immediate,\u201d Storment recalled, and after hearing his son was dead, he wrote, \u201cThe next thing I know I\u2019m sprinting out the front door of the office with my car keys in hand, running ferociously across the street.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, after notifying her husband, Brandes focused on calling 911 and telling Oliver what had happened.\n\n\u201cI knew I had approximately 4 minutes to explain to Oliver that his best friend had died and 15 people were about to swarm our home,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI asked him to pick a location where he would feel safe. Then, sirens.\u201d\n\nFrom there, the couple detailed the chaotic scene that included their cul-de-sac being \u201cpacked with emergency vehicles,\u201d a rush of first-responders storming their driveway with equipment, being unable to see Wiley for nearly 3 hours amid the potential crime scene investigation, and comforting Oliver.\n\n\u201cThey confirmed our son\u2019s death using cardiac leads and slowly returned their equipment back to their truck because even an entire truck of life-saving measures couldn\u2019t be used to save this one,\u201d Brandes sadly recalled.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Family Devastated After Miracle 1-lb.

I laid down next to him in the bed that he loved, held his hand and kept repeating, \u2018What happened, buddy? What happened?'\u201d Storment recalled. \u201cWe stayed next to him for maybe 30 minutes and stroked his hair before they returned with a gurney to take him away.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur time was limited. It was not the way a parent should have to see their child, but it was all we had,\u201d Brandes wrote. \u201cWe held his hand and fixed his hair and kissed his head until our time ran out.\u201d", "description": "Working Parents Urge Others to Be with Their Kids After Their Son Dies", "authors": ["Joelle Goldstein"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/SDDIMvhSaLN94ZPS.Wt6tA--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MjcwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/47fc029f350a486541217cc2244cc78f", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
