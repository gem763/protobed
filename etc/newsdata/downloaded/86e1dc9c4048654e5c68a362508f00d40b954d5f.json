The halo effect even extended to the people in his immediate orbit: Diane, Todd, Princess Carolyn, and Mr. Peanutbutter.\n\nNone of those characters appear in this midseason finale, which comes with a darker message: Even if you outrun your demons, there\u2019s a real chance they\u2019ll catch right back up with you. BoJack Horseman is also a series that has, over the course of six seasons, managed to build out a whole world full of characters. Many of those characters are women who have entered and been dropped from BoJack\u2019s life \u2014 usually after being hurt or discarded by him. And just because we haven\u2019t spent a lot of time with them lately doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not out there, doing their best to heal from their own traumatic experiences at the hands of Hollywoo\u2019s most beloved horse.\n\nIf the previous episode was designed to make audiences wish for a better life for BoJack, \u201cA Quick One, While He\u2019s Away\u201d is designed to remind us that BoJack might not deserve a better life after all the people he\u2019s hurt.\n\nTake Kelsey Jannings, who has been in \u201cdirector\u2019s jail\u201d since she reluctantly agreed \u2014 at BoJack\u2019s urging \u2014 to break into the Richard Nixon Library to film a scene for Secretariat back in season two. As a result, Kelsey was fired from Secretariat, and none of BoJack\u2019s subsequent attempts to make amends did anything to fix the damage he did to Kelsey\u2019s career.\n\nIn \u201cA Quick One, While He\u2019s Away,\u201d we learn that Kelsey has since been reduced to shooting commercials \u2014 excuse me, \u201cimmersive product-placement journeys\u201d \u2014 for the fast-food chain Chicken-4-Dayz. She gets a pitch meeting for a female-centric superhero movie called Fireflame, but only because the dumb, cynical studio executives are eager for the P.R. boost they\u2019ll get from hiring a female director. As usual, Kelsey is too smart and too principled for the material she\u2019s getting. After a disingenuous pitch about an empowered female superhero who is beloved around the world, Kelsey storms back into the office and gives her actual take on the character: \u201cThe rules are different for women. If you\u2019re a woman and save the day, nobody loves you. They take you for granted. Or worse, they resent you. They try to punish you. The more powerful you are, the more they try to take your power away.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s also a lesson being bitterly learned by Gina Cazador, BoJack\u2019s former Philbert co-star and lover, who cut ties with him after he strangled her on-set in an opioid-induced haze. At the time, Gina decided not to expose BoJack\u2019s attack, believing \u2014 probably correctly \u2014 that the ensuing media frenzy would derail her acting career by reducing her to \u201cthe girl that got choked by BoJack Horseman.\u201d\n\nBut even after cutting ties with BoJack, Gina suffers from the aftermath of his attack. On the set of her new movie, she has a PTSD-induced outburst after being touched in a similar way by her co-star, and she storms off the set. She\u2019ll never know it, but the consequences are career-altering: The director, Justin Kenyon, steers Kelsey Jannings away from hiring Gina to star in Fireflame, describing her as difficult. (Instead, it looks like the part will go to Courtney Portnoy, the vain, vapid actress at the center of some of BoJack Horseman\u2019s best tongue-twisters.)\n\nBut those are bridges BoJack burned a long time ago. The most painful reminder of his mistakes will probably come via Hollyhock: His last surviving family member, and a tender spot in the armor he wears against the world. On her trip to New York, Hollyhock encounters a character you almost definitely haven\u2019t thought about in a while: Pete \u201cRepeat\u201d Pocket.\n\nBack in season two, Pete was part of the prom group that BoJack supplied with alcohol. Pete\u2019s date ended up in the hospital with alcohol poisoning, and BoJack convinced him to say he didn\u2019t know where the alcohol came from before abandoning the couple at the hospital. \u201cI was pretty traumatized for a while,\u201d he tells Hollyhock, with the episode cutting to the credits just before he reveals BoJack\u2019s name.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where this first half of the final season of BoJack Horseman ends: Right at the moment when Hollyhock\u2019s image of BoJack is about to be transformed forever. It seems likely that the final half of the final season of BoJack Horseman, which arrives in January 2020, will serve as a kind of reckoning for BoJack and the people whose lives have become enmeshed with his.\n\nFor now, the series leaves viewers to contemplate the problem for themselves. Based on his arc over these eight episodes, I\u2019m convinced: Against all odds, BoJack has changed. But his personal growth, while legitimately moving, doesn\u2019t just wipe all the collateral damage off the board. Does he deserve this new shot at happiness? And if not: What will happen to him?\n\nHorsin\u2019 Around\n\n\u2022 In yet another sign that real consequences for BoJack are on the horizon, the real story of Sarah Lynn\u2019s death is also being pursued by a couple of fast-talking reporters, Paige Sinclair and Maximilian Banks, who bear more than a passing resemblance to His Girl Friday\u2019s Hildy Johnson and Walter Burns. (If the homage wasn\u2019t already obvious enough, Paige\u2019s absurdly accommodating fianc\u00e9, Baxter Bellamy, is named in honor of the actor who played the same role in His Girl Friday.)\n\n\u2022 Character actress Margo Martindale is back! \u201cWhen you get to heaven, look up Margo Martindale. I won\u2019t be there \u2014 but my movies will!\u201d she tells the Mother Superior at the convent. And then she peels out in a stolen cherry-red Alfa Romeo.\n\n\u2022 That\u2019s Broadway star Audra McDonald as Mother Superior, who happened to play the similar role of Mother Abbess in the NBC live production of The Sound of Music in 2013.\n\n\u2022 In a subplot that\u2019s been running in the background since the season six premiere, we finally see a poster for Zack Snyder\u2019s Super Mario Bros. adaptation, which features Jay Hernandez toting two assault rifles in a red cap and overalls. Hey, it couldn\u2019t be worse than the last Super Mario Bros. adaptation.\n\n\u2022 The walls of the Gekko-Rabitowitz are plastered with the posters for Flight of the Pegasus 3 and Flight of the Pegasus 4 \u2014 a franchise that almost starred BoJack Horseman, as well as Lernernerner DiCapriocorn and Some Lady. By Flight of the Pegasus 4, DiCapricorn has been replaced by Some Other Lady.\n\n\u2022 There\u2019s also an unlabeled poster featuring an action hero that looks a lot like The Punisher if he was a rabbit. Gonna go out on a limb here and speculate that he\u2019s The Bunisher.\n\n\u2022 During Hollyhock\u2019s adventure in the streets of Manhattan, there\u2019s a blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it piece of graffiti that reads PIZZA RAT \u2014 a reference to the real-life viral video \u201cstar,\u201d who might be an actual walking-and-talking rat in the BoJack Horseman universe.\n\n\u2022 More misspelled names on takeout coffee cups: Rutabaga Rabitowitz is written as \u201cRUDE BAGEL,\u201d and a cup labeled \u201cVANGUESSA\u201d is presumably intended for Vanessa Gekko.\n\n\u2022 The list of celebrities people say they\u2019ve spotted in Alcoholics Anonymous includes the viral-video star IKEA Monkey.", "description": "Against all odds, BoJack has changed, but the wreckage he\u2019s left in his wake is about to catch up to him.
