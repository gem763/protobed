One in five said they nap once or twice a week \u2014 the same number who reported napping three or more days a week.\n\nFrequent nappers tended to be older men with excess weight and a tobacco habit. Though they reported sleeping longer at night than those who don't nap, they also reported more daytime sleepiness and were more likely to have sleep apnea, a condition that wakes a person repeatedly in the night when their breathing stops.\n\nDuring the five-year follow-up, participants had 155 fatal and non-fatal heart events, the findings showed. These could include heart attacks, strokes and heart disease caused by clogged arteries that required surgical reopening.\n\nNapping once or twice a week cut a person's risk of heart attack, stroke and heart failure by 48%, compared with people who don't nap at all, the researchers found.\n\nFrequent naps initially appeared to increase a person's heart risk by 67%, but that disappeared after accounting for other risk factors, the study authors noted.\n\nDr. Martha Gulati, a cardiologist who is editor-in-chief of CardioSmart.org, the American College of Cardiology's patient website, said it makes sense that frequent napping could be a red flag for health problems.\n\n\"I worry that somebody that naps every day isn't getting good sleep,\" she said. \"Somebody who takes six or seven naps a week, I ask, are you not sleeping well at night? Is that how you're catching up with your sleep?\"\n\nGulati added, \"But I am still going to enjoy my Sunday naps, and now say I am working on lowering my risk for heart disease when my husband asks.\"\n\nResearcher Hausler couldn't say exactly why a couple of naps each week might do a body good.\n\n\"The mechanisms are not straightforward,\" she said. \"We assume that occasional napping might be a result of a physiological compensation allowing to decrease the stress due to insufficient nocturnal sleep and, thus, could have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular disease events.\"\n\nThough she said the results should first be confirmed by other studies, Hausler added: \"We can say that an occasional nap can potentially decrease cardiovascular disease risk for healthy adults.\"\n\nThe study was published online Sept. 9 in the journal Heart.", "description": "New study finds one or two naps a week may be beneficial for heart health \u2013 but more isn't better", "authors": ["Dennis Thompson"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/10/d08ad9d5-3edf-4d06-9901-c853377f22c4/thumbnail/1200x630g1/0e9655a683287e6b38a882c21495c77c/gettyimages-85406775.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
