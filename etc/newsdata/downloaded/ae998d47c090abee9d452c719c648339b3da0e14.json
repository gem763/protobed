Instead, he let their talent and abilities speak for themselves. \"An agent never submitted jokes to me for his client,\" the host of CNBC's \"Jay Leno's Garage\" says. \"People just come up and give me the jokes, and I read them and I decide whether to hire them or not.\"\n\nThe strategy helped prevent Leno from turning down good writers due to an unconscious bias, he says. \"Maybe I might have been influenced by things, like That guy seems kind of old. But I hired them based on material,\" he explains.\n\n\"One guy was so handicapped he couldn't leave his house, but he wrote good jokes. It didn't matter to me,\" says Leno.", "description": "When Jay Leno hired writers for \"The Tonight Show,\" he only cared about one thing: their material.
