(Leonhard Foeger/Reuters)\n\nIn a recent campaign ad for Austria\u2019s far-right Freedom Party, its leader appears in relationship counseling with an actor playing 33-year-old Sebastian Kurz, a conservative star and former chancellor who comfortably won Sunday\u2019s parliamentary elections, according to preliminary results.\n\nDo they really want to risk their great relationship over something so trivial, the therapist asks, with the implication that Kurz\u2019s People\u2019s Party should return to its prior ruling coalition with the far right.\n\nThe problem that has driven them apart? Ibiza-gate, a scandal that brought down Kurz\u2019s government earlier this year after the leaking of secret videos showing the former Freedom Party head, his coalition partner, apparently promising lucrative government contracts to a Russian heiress.\n\n[Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz ousted in no-confidence vote]\n\nKurz, who was the youngest elected world leader when the scandal forced him to call snap elections, appears to have weathered the storm well. His party has won 38 percent of the vote, according to preliminary results published by the Austria Press Agency, which excludes absentee ballots. That would be an increase of almost 6 percent since elections in 2017, although he will still need to form a coalition to govern.\n\nWhat remains unclear is whether he will team up again with the Freedom Party after a campaign that has focused more on personality politics than on policy. The country of 8.8 million has been run by a nonpartisan caretaker government since June.\n\nPartial results showed the Freedom Party suffering a sizable blow, dropping to 17 percent of the vote. The Greens were predicted to win 12 percent, and the liberal Neos 7 percent. The Social Democrats, the longtime coalition partner of the People\u2019s Party before the current leadership changed tack, won just over 22 percent.\n\nThe Freedom Party\u2019s decline could make Kurz more likely to look elsewhere for a coalition, a move that would strike a symbolic blow to the far right in Europe.\n\nPolitically, the Freedom Party would appear to be a natural ally. It was by adopting a hard line on immigration \u2014 an issue that topped the agenda in Austria following the 2015 migrant crisis \u2014 that Kurz managed to turn around the fortunes of his People\u2019s Party and become chancellor in 2017.\n\nKurz\u2019s strategy has been watched with interest by conservative parties across Europe that are losing votes to the more extreme fringes. He had taken a hard line on immigration, crediting himself with closing off one of the main routes for refugees flowing into Europe, but his government had maintained a pro-European Union agenda.\n\nBut in the wake of the Ibiza scandal, and when issues such as climate change jostle with immigration to top voter concerns, analysts say Kurz might look elsewhere to build his ruling coalition. Kurz, the right\u2019s golden boy, has refrained from ruling out any coalition option during campaigning.\n\nThe options open to him are like choosing between \u201cthe plague, cholera and Ebola,\u201d said Austrian political analyst Thomas Hofer, who is no relation to the head of the Freedom Party, Norbert Hofer. A tie-up with the Freedom Party would be easy, but Kurz is looking for stability and will want to avoid another snap election.\n\nThe Freedom Party \u201cis practically begging\u201d Kurz for a coalition, the analyst said, but no matter how close they are in terms of agenda, the Freedom Party\u2019s upheaval reduces the likelihood that Kurz will continue the alliance.\n\n\n\nNorbert Hofer of the right-wing Austrian Freedom Party speaks outside a polling station on Sunday.

The Social Democrats are vying for second place in the elections.\n\nNegotiations over coalition building could be lengthy.\n\n\u201cKurz must ask himself the question whether he considers the Freedom Party to be capable of governing again and if he wants to take the risk,\u201d said Peter Filzmaier, a politics professor at the University of Krems.\n\nKurz is likely to have picked up votes from the Freedom Party, whose former supporters have \u201cno other choice\u201d but Kurz, Filzmaier said.\n\nA different coalition \u201cwould send a message to other European countries, to other conservative parties,\u201d he said.\n\nLuisa Beck contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\nFar-right parties hope to undermine E.U. by winning European elections\n\nAustria\u2019s Sebastian Kurz, seeking to be a power player in Europe, could help bring down Germany\u2019s Merkel\n\nAustrians vote Sunday \u2014 with a major corruption scandal in the background\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "It is unclear whether the 33-year-old conservative\u2019s party will again form a coalition with the tainted Freedom Party.", "authors": ["Loveday Morris", "Jerusalem Bureau Chief Covering The Middle East", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/y6a5B8n7E9VTUM40qce_B1BAQqw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YEPMSRXCTQI6TJXIQ5M4LR7WBA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
