Sondland, Volker and other witnesses have described the president as suspicious of Ukraine despite well-established American support for the fledgling democracy there.\n\n\"President Trump was sceptical,\" Sondland testified. He added that only later did he understand that Trump, by connecting the Ukrainians with his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, was interested in probing the 2016 election as well as the Biden family. \"It was apparent to all of us that the key to changing President Trump's mind on Ukraine was Mr Giuliani.\"\n\n\"Our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it,\" Trump told Zelensky during their \"perfect\" phone call, according to a rough transcript released by the White House. \"I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike. The server, they say Ukraine has it.\"\n\nTrump was airing the conspiracy theory view, shared by Giuliani, that the security firm CrowdStrike, which was hired by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to investigate the 2016 hack of its email, may have had ties to Ukraine.\n\nCrowdStrike determined in June 2016 that Russian agents had broken into the committee's network and stolen emails that were subsequently published by WikiLeaks. The firm's findings were confirmed by FBI investigators and helped lead to Mueller's indictments of 12 individuals from Russia's military intelligence agency. But the loose conspiracy theory contends that the DNC email hack was a setup, bolstered by fake computer records, designed to cast blame on Russia.\n\nEven the president's Republican allies have tried to dissuade Trump from it. \"I've never been a CrowdStrike fan; I mean this whole thing of a server,\" said Republican congressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina last week. Meadows, a confidant of Trump, said he's sure Ukraine had some role in the US election. But he views the search for the email server as farfetched. \"I would not, on my dime, send a private attorney looking for some server in a foreign country,\" he told reporters.\n\nPerhaps contributing to the conspiracy theories surrounding CrowdStrike and the DNC is the fact that the FBI never took possession of the actual computer server that would have held the hacked emails. Instead, the FBI relied on the forensics provided by CrowdStrike. The FBI had \"repeatedly stressed\" to the DNC its desire to have access to servers, former FBI director James Comey testified at a March 2017 hearing before a House panel. But he acknowledged it is not unusual for the FBI to use such forensics in place of the actual hard drive during cyber investigations.\n\nOther Republicans have also tried to convince Trump it was not Ukraine that was involved. Trump's former Homeland Security adviser, Tom Bossert, said Giuliani had done Trump a disservice by pushing the false story.\n\n\"I am deeply frustrated with what he and the legal team is doing and repeating that debunked theory to the president,\" Bossert said in September on ABC. \"It sticks in his mind when he hears it over and over again...That conspiracy theory has got to go. They have to stop with that. It cannot continue to be repeated.\"", "description": "Donald Trump has compared the impeachment inquiry surrounding him to \u201ca lynching\u201d after calling on\u00a0his Republican\u00a0peers to \u201cget tougher and fight\u201d, addressing colleagues at a drawn-out White House Cabinet meeting on Monday in which he also rubbished the Constitution\u2019s anti-corruption Emoluments Clause as \u201cphoney\u201d.", "authors": ["Joe Sommerlad"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/22/08/donald-trump.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
