Germany could suffer another hit if the Brexit negotiations unravel over the next week or the conflict in Syria spirals out of control.\n\nAnd that is focusing minds in Berlin.\n\nRead More: The Plot to Scrap Germany\u2019s Balanced Budgets Has Already Begun\n\nMerkel has hinted as much herself. She still insists the next generation should not inherit an unwieldy debt load. But last week she balanced that by saying Germans shouldn\u2019t become obsessed with a balanced budget -- investing in the future, including with a new climate package, is also a priority.\n\n\u201cThis is not about taking up budgetary issues alone and saying the \u2018black zero\u2019 is our fetish,\u201d Merkel said in an Oct. 10 speech to a trade union in Nuremberg.\n\nJust on Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for German growth, predicting an expansion of only 0.5% this year. It reiterated its call for the country to ramp up budget stimulus.\n\nIn a time of cheap credit and global economic disruption, the finance ministry under Social Democrat Olaf Scholz is already shifting away from decades of economic dogma focused on public savings. The government has drawn up a raft of options, including subsidies for electric car sales and tax cuts, that could be set into motion if needed, according to people with knowledge of the plans.\n\nThe IMF said that Germany should take account of low borrowing costs to invest, \u201ceven from a pure cost-benefit perspective.\u201d\n\nIn August, Scholz, who is making a bid to lead Germany\u2019s Social Democrats, suggested the government could muster up to 50 billion euros ($55 billion) of extra spending in a crisis. That figure matches the extra borrowing deployed in the global financial crisis a decade ago.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a position, with the financial fundamentals we have, to respond with many, many billions, if indeed an economic crisis erupts in Germany and Europe,\u201d Scholz told parliament in September. \u201cAnd we will do it. That\u2019s Keynesian economics come alive, if you will.\u201d\n\nRead More: German Fiscal Stimulus Already Creeping In, Whatever Merkel Says\n\nBut while the finance ministry is increasingly ready to embrace public spending, it needs allies in Merkel\u2019s party and its Bavarian sister group, the Christian Social Union. That bloc has long been a bastion of the fiscal discipline championed by Scholz\u2019s predecessor as finance chief, Wolfgang Schaeuble.\n\nGetting Germany to use its fiscal space to bolster the economy has become a priority for European Central Bank President Mario Draghi and his imminent successor, Christine Lagarde. He told journalists last month that it\u2019s \u201chigh time for the fiscal policy to take change\u201d in the region.\n\nPart of the shift has to do with a growing recognition that Germany should take advantage of historically low interest rates to invest in upgrading its infrastructure. As part of the climate package unveiled last month, Merkel\u2019s coalition agreed to pump 1 billion euros a year into the state rail operator, Deutsche Bahn.\n\nUnspent Funds\n\nMerkel\u2019s caucus colleagues still won\u2019t be shifting on the so-called debt brake which limits German deficit spending, according to the CDU lawmaker. And he also insisted that a shortage of shovel-ready projects and too much bureaucracy rather than a shortage of cash -- the state has plenty of unspent funds already earmarked. But the CDU is coming round all the same.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The German political class is preparing itself to deliver bold fiscal stimulus if the economy needs it.Lawmakers from Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrat-led group have been among the most crucial opponents of finance ministry plans to respond to an economic hit and their stance", "authors": ["Patrick Donahue"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GxueAzQNn73KeOqE0iwOxg--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/079174e9eecc7a7cfb18253e109697b3", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
