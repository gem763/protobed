It could be that some investors (or the computer algorithms that guide their trading) were put off by Trump's use of the phrase Phase 1, suggesting that there's much more to negotiate and much more that's contentious.

The Treasury yield moved up to 1,767% from Thursday's 1.656%.\n\nOil prices moved more than 2% higher, in part because of the progress of the trade talks, which would be a boon to global growth.
