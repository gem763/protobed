There it is, that line. He did what he's been accused of doing. It's impeachable,\" said Matthews, reading from the complaint, along with fellow MSNBC hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski.\n\nTRUMP GOES ON THE OFFENSIVE, ALLEGES BIDEN CORRUPTION, SAYS DEMS THREATENED UKRAINE AID MULTIPLE TIMES\n\n\"It's a moment, and Democrats, if they've got brains, and any political savvy\u2013 will grab this moment. No more hearings, no more subpoenas, no more contempt citations... they've got him.\"\n\nThe rough transcript of the July call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was released a day earlier by the White House. It confirmed that Trump sought an investigation from Ukraine into the Biden family, though it did not show the president explicitly leveraging U.S. aid as had initially been suggested in some media reports.\n\nBut the whistleblower complaint, released by the Democrat-led House Intelligence Committee ahead of testimony from Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, goes further, though it is not a first-hand account of the call.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe whistleblower, who remains anonymous, says in the complaint that White House officials who heard the call were \"deeply disturbed\" by it, and that White House lawyers discussed how to handle the call \"because of the likelihood, in the officials' retelling, that they had witnessed the president abuse his office for personal gain.\"\n\n\"In the days following the phone call, I learned from multiple U.S. officials that senior White House officials had intervened to 'lock down' all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced -- as is customary -- by the White House Situation Room,\" the complaint says.\n\nREAD THE COMPLAINT\n\nFox News' Ronn Blitzer contributed to this report.", "description": "MSNBC's Chris Matthews declared Thursday that Democrats have the evidence they need to impeach President Trump, as he read the contents of a whistleblower complaint.", "authors": ["David Montanaro", "David Montanaro Is A Senior Editor With Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/05/chris-matthews-MSNBC.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
