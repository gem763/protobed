Donald Trump\u2019s Probably Won\u2019t Either.", "language": "en", "text": "Text size\n\nIt\u2019s official: Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announced that the House of Representatives will open a formal impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. Being market reporters, we\u2019ll leave the punditry to Fox News, CNN, and the rest. What we care about is the impact on the stock market, and from what little information we have to go by, impeachment doesn\u2019t seem to be high on the list of concerns.\n\nWe don\u2019t have a lot of examples to go by. Andrew Johnson was impeached\u2014but not convicted\u2014in 1868, and while I\u2019m sure there is market data from back then, I don\u2019t have any. We then have to wait until 1974, when impeachment proceedings began against Richard Nixon, but ended after he resigned. Bill Clinton was impeached in 1998, but acquitted in 1999. So that leaves us with a sample size of two, not exactly statistically significant.\n\nAnd even the examples we have don\u2019t tell us anything significant. From Feb. 6, 1974, when the impeachment process against Nixon formally began, through Aug. 9, 1974, when he resigned, the S&P 500 dropped 13%. So clearly, impeachment is bad for the stock market.\n\nExcept that from the start of Clinton\u2019s impeachment in January 1998 through his acquittal in February 1999, the S&P 500 gained 28%, according to Bespoke Investment Group data. There was a 20% drop in there, but that was caused by the implosion of Long-Term Capital Management, not anything related to the impeachment itself. So clearly impeachment is good for the stock market.\n\nOr could it be that the differences between the two were due to something besides the impeachment proceedings? Bespoke\u2019s Paul Hickey chalks the difference up to the economies of the two periods. \u201cWhile stocks made it through the Clinton impeachment pretty much unscathed, the experience during the Nixon...impeachment and resignation in the early 1970s was much worse, but the difference between those two periods was the economy, which was in two very different places in the 1970s and 1990s,\u201d he writes.\n\nAnd nowhere was the role of the economy more clear than in Tuesday\u2019s market action, when the S&P 500 started declining after disappointing consumer-confidence data were released.\n\nWrites Hickey: \u201cWith regards to impeachment, whatever ultimately happens regarding the President, the Democratic-controlled House, and GOP-controlled Senate is anyone\u2019s guess, but if you want to know how the market will react, you\u2019re better off paying attention to the economy rather the Washington headlines.\u201d\n\nWrite to Ben Levisohn at Ben.Levisohn@barrons.com", "description": "President Trump\u2019s impeachment proceedings will get all the attention, but the economy matters more for the stock market, if history is a guide.", "authors": ["Ben Levisohn"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-83710/social", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
