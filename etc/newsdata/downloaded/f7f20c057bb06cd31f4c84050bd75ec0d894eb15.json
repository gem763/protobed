In one instance, they allegedly shot and killed a woman after raping her.\n\nOn October 29, 2015, Ndlovu and an accomplice allegedly broke into a house in Germiston and demanded money from a woman living there.\n\nWhen she could not meet their demands, they allegedly forced her to the main house on the property so that she could request for the door be opened for her.\n\nThey allegedly proceeded to rob the house after which, according to court papers, they \"plugged the iron in and burned [another] complainant \u2026 with the hot iron on his foot\" and raped the two women living in the house.\n\nNdlovu allegedly also forced his victims to nearby fields or parks where he and a co-perpetrator took turns raping them.\n\nIt is unclear when the trial will resume.", "description": "The trial of a 29-year-old man, who is facing 62 counts relating to various charges that include 19 counts of rape and the alleged rape of a  12-year-old girl, was postponed after the interpreter fell ill.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9419/e4e957746ee4471385c1ac9fff8fe985.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
