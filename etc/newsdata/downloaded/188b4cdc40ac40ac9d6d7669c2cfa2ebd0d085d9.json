Cummings passed away at Gilchrist Hospice Care, a Johns Hopkins affiliate, at 2:45 a.m. from \"complications concerning longstanding health challenges,\" his office said.\n\nMaya Rockeymoore Cummings, the chairwoman of the Maryland Democratic Party and Cummings' wife, said in a statement that Cummings was \"an honorable man who proudly served his district and the nation with dignity, integrity, compassion and humility.\"\n\n\"He worked until his last breath because he believed our democracy was the highest and best expression of our collective humanity and that our nation's diversity was our promise, not our problem,\" Rockeymoore Cummings said. \"I loved him deeply and will miss him dearly.\"\n\nRepresentative Elijah Cummings is seen overseeing a House Oversight and Reform Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., in July Reuters\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi ordered the flags at the Capitol to be flown at half staff in his memory. The White House, too, lowered its flag.\n\nIn her weekly press conference on Thursday, Pelosi said she was \"devastated by the loss\" of Cummings, who she referred to as \"the North Star\" of the House. She said she may rename a bill to lower prescription drug costs in his honor.\n\n\"He was not just a great congressman, he was a great man,\" House Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on MSNBC Thursday morning.\n\nBaltimore Mayor Bernard C. Young said in a statement that \"people throughout the world have lost a powerful voice and one of the strongest and most gifted crusaders for social justice.\"\n\nMaryland Governor Larry Hogan, a Republican, said in a statement that \"Congressman Cummings leaves behind an incredible legacy of fighting for Baltimore City and working to improve people's lives. He was a passionate and dedicated public servant whose countless contributions made our state and our country better.\"\n\nPresident Trump praised Cummings' \"strength, passion and wisdom\" in a tweet, despite the insults he hurled at Cummings this summer.\n\n\"My warmest condolences to the family and many friends of Congressman Elijah Cummings. I got to see first hand the strength, passion and wisdom of this highly respected political leader. His work and voice on so many fronts will be very hard, if not impossible, to replace!\" the president tweeted shortly before 9 a.m.\n\nThe House Oversight and Reform Committee chairman, a Democrat and 23-year House veteran, was a key figure in the impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump and a recent target of intense criticism from the president.\n\nCummings missed two roll call votes Thursday, the first day back following a two-week House recess. He hadn't returned to work after having a medical procedure that he said would only keep him away for about a week, The Baltimore Sun noted. He previously released a statement saying he'd be back by the time the session resumed. He hadn't taken part in a roll call vote since September 11.\n\nHe hadn't returned to work after having a medical procedure that he said would only keep him away for about a week, The Baltimore Sun noted. The procedure already caused Cummings to miss a September hearing on Washington, D.C., statehood. The statement didn't detail the procedure. He previously was treated for heart and knee issues.\n\nCummings' Humble beginnings\n\nA sharecropper's son, Cummings was a formidable orator who passionately advocated for the poor in his black-majority district, which encompasses a large portion of Baltimore as well as more well-to-do suburbs.\n\nAs chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, Cummings led multiple investigations of Mr. Trump's dealings, including probes in 2019 relating to the president's family members serving in the White House.\n\nThe president responded by criticizing Cummings' district as a \"rodent-infested mess\" where \"no human being would want to live.\" The comments came weeks after Mr. Trump drew bipartisan condemnation following his calls for Democratic congresswomen of color to get out of the U.S. \"right now\" and go back to their \"broken and crime-infested countries.\"\n\nElijah Cummings to Trump: \"Do not just criticize us\"\n\nCummings replied that government officials must stop making \"hateful, incendiary comments\" that only serve to divide and distract the nation from its real problems, including mass shootings and white supremacy.\n\n\"Those in the highest levels of the government must stop invoking fear, using racist language and encouraging reprehensible behavior,\" Cummings said in a speech at the National Press Club.\n\nCummings told the Baltimore Sun that he had only spoken to Mr. Trump one-on-one once, in 2017. Cummings recalled saying: \"Mr. President, you're now 70-something, I'm 60-something. Very soon you and I will be dancing with the angels. The thing that you and I need to do is figure out what we can do \u2014 what present can we bring to generations unborn?\"\n\nWorking way up\n\nCummings' career spanned decades in Maryland politics. He rose through the ranks of the Maryland House of Delegates before winning his congressional seat in a special election in 1996 to replace former Representative Kweisi Mfume, who left the seat to lead the NAACP.\n\nCummings continued his rise in Congress. In 2016, he was the senior Democrat on the House Benghazi Committee, which he said was \"nothing more than a taxpayer-funded effort to bring harm to Hillary Clinton's campaign\" for president.\n\nCummings was an early supporter of Barack Obama's presidential bid in 2008.\n\nThroughout his career, Cummings used his fiery voice to highlight the struggles and needs of inner-city residents. He was a firm believer in some much-debated approaches to help the poor and addicted, such as needle exchange programs as a way to reduce the spread of AIDS. Cummings was very popular in his district, where he was a key member of the community.\n\nCummings said in an interview with \"60 Minutes\" in January that he was one of the few members of Congress who lived in an inner city environment.\n\n\"I like to be among my constituents. Let me tell you something man, if I don't do well in this block I'm in trouble. I mean, if you wanna take a poll, if I lost in this block I might as well go \u2013 I might as well stay home,\" Cummings said in the interview.\n\nElijah Cummings: The 2019 \"60 Minutes\" interview\n\nCummings was born on Jan. 18, 1951. In grade school, a counselor told Cummings he was too slow to learn and spoke poorly and he would never fulfill his dream of becoming a lawyer.\n\n\"I was devastated,\" Cummings told The Associated Press in 1996, shortly before he won his seat in Congress. \"My whole life changed. I became very determined.\"\n\nIt steeled Cummings to prove that counselor wrong. He became not only a lawyer, but one of the most powerful orators in the Maryland House of Delegates, where he entered office in 1983. He rose to become House speaker pro tem, the first black delegate to hold the position. He would begin his comments slowly, developing his theme and raising the emotional heat until it became like a sermon from the pulpit.\n\nCummings was quick to note the differences between Congress and the Maryland General Assembly, which has long been controlled by Democrats.\n\n\"After coming from the state where, basically, you had a lot of people working together, it's clear that the lines are drawn here,\" Cummings said about a month after entering office in Washington in 1996.\n\nCummings chaired the Congressional Black Caucus from 2003 to 2004, employing a hard-charging, explore-every-option style to put the group in the national spotlight.\n\nHe cruised to big victories in the overwhelmingly Democratic district, which had given Maryland its first black congressman in 1970 when Parren Mitchell was elected.\n\nCummings addressed his recent health issues in the January interview with \"60 Minutes.\"\n\n\"Like I tell my constituents, \"Don't get it twisted. You know, I may \u2013 my knee may be hurtin' a little bit, but my mind is clear. My mission is clear.\" And I am prepared and able to do what I have to do. And I will do it to the very best of my ability, so help me God,\" Cummings said.\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nAccording to The Baltimore Sun, Cummings' seat will remain vacant until a special election is held.\n\nHogan, the state's Republican governor, has 10 days to officially call for the special election, which will take place no earlier than 65 days after that, which would be late February.\n\nHogan's spokesman, Mike Ricci, expressed uncertainty to The Sun on Thursday morning about when the special election would happen.\n\nAs for Cummings' role on the House Oversight committee, Representative Carolyn Maloney of New York will fill in as acting chair until Democrats choose a permanent leader. The timing for when that will happen is unclear, according to a senior Democratic leadership aide who spoke to The Sun on condition of anonymity.", "description": "Key figure in Trump impeachment inquiry succumbed to \"complications concerning longstanding health challenges,\" his office said", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/17/4e5a7672-d3a8-4259-b4d1-c93a546e907d/thumbnail/1200x630/e48172032feabcbb9a29a2c135ac2128/elijah-ap-19290338342814.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
