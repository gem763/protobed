Meanwhile, other surveys on manufacturing issued by Markit showed the U.S. sector in expansion while reflecting improvement in China and Europe. \u201cI know investors are scared because they reacted to the weaker data and completely ignored\u201d the Markit figures, Dwyer said.\n\nSee: A \u2018jinx month\u2019 for the stock market is under way \u2014 that\u2019s very bad news for small-cap investors\n\nEven if one were to take the ISM data as the final word on the state of manufacturing, Dwyer argued, there are still many reasons for investors to take this opportunity to position themselves for a forthcoming rebound in economic and corporate profit growth.\n\nDwyer sees the current soft spot as a repeat of the \u201cmini-recessions\u201d in 2011-2012, triggered by the European debt crisis, and that of 2015-2016, instigated by a collapse in oil prices.\n\n\u201cMarket pundits keep trying to identify the next recession while we are just beginning to emerge from the third mini recession of this cycle,\u201d Dwyer said in a Tuesday note to clients. Low interest rates, he argued, \u201chave already done the work of stimulating future growth, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s comment that the Fed will be more aggressive if data weakness continues to support an offensive position.\u201d\n\nDwyer told MarketWatch that he believes the Fed will move to cut interest rates for the third time this year in October, following the weaker than expected ISM data. He also predicted that the global growth picture has begun bottom, pointing to the OECD composite leading index, which shows that growth is deteriorating less quickly today than in recent months, and a recent jump in the Citigroup Economic Surprise index, which shows global economic data has begun to surpass expectations.\n\nCanaccord Genuity\n\nAlso see: Fed rate cut in October seen as more likely after weak ISM report\n\n\u201cWe believe the stage for the next leg higher toward our 2020 S&P 500 index SPX, -1.23% target of 3,350 is set, driven by less poor global economic data, ultimately leading to a reacceleration [of global growth], continued accommodative monetary policy and news and tweet fatigue,\u201d he wrote. \u201cVery few are betting on an improved growth outlook that data suggest is already happening.\u201d\n\nThough he believes that uncertainty surrounding U.S., British and Chinese politics will continue to drive volatility in the months ahead, \u201cthe question becomes what do you do about that.\u201d Dwyer recommends investors overweight their portfolios in cyclical sectors, including industrials and financials.\n\nThe single most compelling reason for optimism, he said, was global central bank policy, which has become increasingly dovish in recent months.\n\nRelated: As others see gloom, BlackRock says world economy to accelerate thanks to central bank easing\n\n\u201cIt comes down to a simple point, the global central banks are telling you what their game plan is and investors keep trying to figure out if it\u2019s the right or wrong move,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just is.\u201d", "description": "A bottoming in global growth and easy central bank policy will power returns, Dwyer says", "authors": ["Chris Matthews", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS418_offens_ZG_20191001125852.jpg"}
