It Ended in the Iraq War.", "language": "en", "text": "President Donald Trump answers questions from reporters after signing an executive order in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, Oct. 9, 2019. (Doug Mills/The New York Times)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The last time the United States abandoned allies in the Middle East, military officials say, it helped lead to the Iraq War.\n\nNow, almost 30 years later, President Donald Trump has pulled U.S. special forces and support troops away from Kurdish allies in northern Syria, easing the way for Turkey\u2019s promised offensive, which began on Wednesday.\n\nIt is too soon to say with any certainty where Trump\u2019s abandonment of the Kurdish fighters who did the heavy lifting in the fight against the Islamic State will lead. But already, anguished U.S. military and national security officials are sounding alarms that clearing the way for Turkey to bomb the Kurds could have long-term repercussions, just as the desertion of allies did then.\n\n\u201cIn the course of American history, when we have stuck with our allies in troubling circumstances, from the U.K. and Australia under attack in WWII to South Korea in the Korean War, things tend to work out to our benefit,\u201d said James G. Stavridis, a retired admiral and former supreme allied commander for Europe. \u201cWhen we walk away from loyal allies, as we did in Vietnam and are now threatening to do in Afghanistan and Syria, the wheels come off.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the Persian Gulf War, the United States\u2019 refusal to aid a rebellion it encouraged in Iraq allowed Saddam Hussein to brutally crush the insurgents, leaving him in power and U.S. allies on the ground alienated and slaughtered by the thousands.\n\nNow, with the Kurds potentially facing a similar fate, a Pentagon official said anger within the military was deeper than at any other point in Trump\u2019s tenure as commander in chief.\n\nThat is in part because U.S. military officials personally know the Kurds they have been fighting alongside. They consider them friends and even, in some cases, brothers in arms. While the Kurds may not have been with the Americans in Normandy, as Trump curiously noted on Wednesday, neither were the U.S. service members who are now in Iraq and Syria. What those service members know, military officials say, is that the Kurds have been with them in Manbij, and Raqqa, and the Middle Euphrates River Valley.\n\n\u201cWhat happens if we leave?\u201d the normally reticent Gen. Joseph L. Votel, who until March was the commander of U.S. Central Command overseeing the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, wrote in an op-ed article in The Atlantic on Tuesday, two days after the White House announced it was leaving the Kurds. In the piece, Votel spoke fondly of the top Kurdish general, Mazloum Abdi, whom he called \u201cimpressive and thoughtful.\u201d\n\nVotel, now retired, wrote that Turkish attacks on the Kurdish fighters, \u201ccoupled with a hasty U.S. departure, now threaten to rapidly destabilize an already fragile security situation in Syria\u2019s northeast, where ISIS\u2019 physical caliphate was only recently defeated.\u201d\n\nPaul D. Eaton, a retired major general and veteran of the Iraq War, was more blunt. \u201cIt takes time to build trust,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd any time you erode trust, like this, it\u2019s that much harder to bring it back.\u201d\n\nPentagon officials fear that Turkey\u2019s incursion could lead to the release of tens of thousands of Islamic State fighters and their families who are being held in detention facilities under Kurdish control, and a return, quickly, of the self-proclaimed caliphate that the United States and its partners have spent the last five years destroying.\n\nBut even more, they fear that the next time the United States is looking for help from fighters on the ground in the region, the Americans will not be able to find it.\n\nThis has happened before. In February 1991, as the Desert Storm campaign was unfolding in Iraq, President George H.W. Bush, during a rally in Andover, Massachusetts, suggested that the Iraqi people \u201ctake matters into their own hands and force Saddam Hussein, the dictator, to step aside.\u201d\n\nTwo weeks later, Bush made another call to arms, saying that putting Hussein \u201caside\u201d would \u201cfacilitate the resolution of all these problems that exist and certainly would facilitate the acceptance of Iraq back into the family of peace-loving nations.\u201d\n\nIraq\u2019s feared Republican Guard did not heed Bush. But the Shiites and the Kurds did. On March 1, the day after Bush halted the Desert Storm war effort, Iraqi Shiites in the south and Kurds in the north began a rebellion against Hussein.", "description": "WASHINGTON -- The last time the United States abandoned allies in the Middle East, military officials say, it helped lead to the Iraq War.Now, almost 30 years later, President Donald Trump has pulled U.S. special forces and support troops away from Kurdish allies in northern Syria, easing the way for", "authors": ["Helene Cooper"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/to8k6IxXcH8Fjr5FSPtQaw--~B/aD0zODQwO3c9NTUyNztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/1e296a31176ded9dddb26a1a36bc695b", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
