Reedy Creek is a special taxing district set up by the state of Florida and Disney and provides emergency services for the theme parks..\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to Disney for additional details.\n\nThe Orlando Sentinel reports that it's unclear if two of the three taken to the hospital were on the gondolas when they got stuck.\n\nDisney confirmed to USA TODAY it was operating the Skyliner without guests Tuesday as part of its review of the service; it has yet to set a reopening date.\n\nThe company previously said no injuries were reported and that it was working with each guest \"regarding impacts to their visit with us.\"\n\nRiders were stuck when one of the Skyliner cars became stuck in the air, the company said. Disney's website still says the service is \"temporarily closed.\"\n\n\"We have a team diligently looking into the cause of Saturday\u2019s malfunction on the Epcot line of the Disney Skyliner,\" Disney told USA TODAY in a statement on Monday. \"We have been in contact with the guests, many of whom were on the Skyliner for more than three hours until we were able to restart the system. We express our sincere apologies for the inconvenience and continue to work with each guest individually.\"\n\nIt was not immediately clear how many riders were stuck. Photos on Twitter showed a few yellow cars jumbled together along a platform.\n\nThe Skyliner system opened a week ago to much fanfare; Disney announced it would be ready in fall 2019 in November of last year. The company describes the Skyliner on its website as a \"grand, state-of-the-art gondola system\" that connects Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios and Epcot to four Disney hotels.\n\nContributing: John Bacon\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Walt Disney World Skyliner accident: People taken to hospital", "description": "After Walt Disney World Resort's\u00a0new aerial cable car system, the Skyliner,\u00a0stranded passengers for hours on Saturday, Disney is testing the service.", "authors": ["David Oliver", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kih7rHc99asZ4eAcUBy2AA--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://d.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/1009217/4a9f609a-60d2-4317-802f-3a7327fc6578/255563ba-f5dc-5807-b5e5-6150c274b96d/data_3_0.jpg?s=05476fb2ecb36922e270df506b9a5104&c=e8c0d51e37181f6376f6a8c9b3c9326b&a=tripleplay4us&mr=0", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
