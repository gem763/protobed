Before she was taken to a nearby hospital that month, \"she was saturated with filth and her feet were significantly pruned from standing in her own sewage, urine and excrement,\" U.S. District Judge David Lawson wrote in 2018 when denying a motion from Corizon Health to dismiss the lawsuit.\n\nDOJ: Federal prison official had sexual relationship with ex-prison union chief\n\nPrison suicides: Federal prison suicides were quietly rising before Jeffrey Epstein's death in a New York detention center\n\nPrison officials shut off the water to Martin's cell as a punishment for allowing toilet water to spill on her blanket, according to court records.\n\nAlthough she needed urgent medical treatment, prison staff continued to inject Martin with sedatives, without checking her vital signs, according to depositions in the case.\n\nWhen she was taken to the hospital, Martin was diagnosed with respiratory failure, severe dehydration (described as a water deficit level of 11 liters), liver failure and renal failure. Because of her dehydration and respiratory failure, she suffered severe brain damage and related complications that required 24-hour care. She was paroled in April 2016 and died in October 2017, around the time her family sued.\n\nUnder the terms of the settlement approved last week, the Corrections Department will pay $550,000, and several other defendants, including Corizon \u2013 which holds a five-year, $715.7 million prison health contract with the state \u2013 will pay $700,000, records show.\n\n'They took no action': Colorado woman files lawsuit after prison video shows her giving birth alone in jail\n\nA Corizon spokeswoman would not say how much of the settlement will be paid by the company and declined further comment. Corrections Department spokesman Chris Gautz declined comment, deferring to the Attorney General's Office.\n\nMartin's son Robert will receive more than $700,000 and her two sisters will receive $20,000 each.\n\nThe Fieger law firm, which represented the family, will receive about $475,000 in legal fees and costs.\n\nIn other legal payouts this year involving the Michigan Department of Corrections:\n\nIn September, a jury in Genesee County awarded $11.4 million to two black prison workers in a case alleging racial discrimination and retaliation. The jury found that Lisa Griffey, a probation officer, was discriminated against and harassed because she is black. The jury found that her husband, Cedric, was retaliated against until he was forced to resign because he and his wife complained about the harassment.\n\nIn May, the department agreed to pay $860,000 to settle a lawsuit brought by relatives of a prisoner who hanged herself after officials allegedly placed a bet on whether she would become suicidal. Janika Edmond, 25, used her bra to hang herself in a shower at Women's Huron Valley Correctional Facility in 2015 after her request for a suicide prevention vest prompted an officer to pump her fist and exclaim, \"Somebody owes me lunch,\" according to video evidence.\n\nAlso in May, an Ingham County jury awarded former state prison warden Jeff Larson $438,000 in damages after finding supervisors retaliated against him for defending a female subordinate who complained about sexual discrimination and harassment.\n\nIn January, a parole-probation officer settled her sexual harassment suit against the department for $1.1 million.\n\nFollow Paul Egan on Twitter: @paulegan4\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/09/lawsuit-settlement-michigan-prisoner-died-after-water-cell-cut/3923619002/", "description": "Prison officials allegedly shut off the water to a woman's cell as a punishment for allowing toilet water to spill on her blanket.", "authors": ["Paul Egan", "Published P.M.
