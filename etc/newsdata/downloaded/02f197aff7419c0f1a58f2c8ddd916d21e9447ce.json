But The Times reported that his private musings were far more gruesome - he spoke of digging a moat along the border and filling it with \"snakes or alligators,\" The Times reported, adding that his aides even sought to find out how much the plan would cost.\n\nTrump also suggested electrifying the border wall and placing spikes on top that could puncture human flesh, according to the report.\n\nTrump had publicly suggested soldiers shoot migrants if they threw rocks - an idea his staff later told him was illegal. But in private, he went even further and suggested shooting migrants in the legs to slow them down, according to The Times.\n\nHis aides told him that, too, would be illegal, according to The Times.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.\n\n\"The president was frustrated, and I think he took that moment to hit the reset button,\" Thomas Homan, the former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told The Times.\n\nAt the time, the number of migrants apprehended at the border soared to more than 100,000 per month, overwhelming Border Patrol agents and triggering chaos at many of the Border Patrol stations tasked with detaining and caring for migrant families and children.\n\nThe issue consumed much of Trump's time and energy, and contributed to the ousting of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.", "description": "Enraged by the soaring numbers of migrant families seeking asylum in the US, Trump reportedly turned to a number of gruesome solutions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/3732/2c2434d068154987a3470cffe099b69d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
