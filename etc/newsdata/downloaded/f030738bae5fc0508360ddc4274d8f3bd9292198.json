Speaking at a meeting of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s Central Committee, Xi called for the adoption of blockchain \u201cas an important breakthrough for independent innovation of core technologies.\u201d\n\nState-run outlet Xinhua revealed that Xi lauded the potential benefits of blockchain technologies in a swath of industries, including finance, education, health care, food security, and more.\n\nThese statements may seem rather bland \u2014 they seem like something any world leader would say in regards to a fledgling, budding technological class \u2014 but the Chinese president\u2019s statements will have and already have had a massive effect on China\u2019s blockchain efforts. So much so that a Chinese bank \u2014 yes, a financial institution \u2014 has purportedly just made an investment in a massive Bitcoin startup.\n\nChinese Bank Invests in Bitcoin Startup\n\nThe rumors of Bitcoin\u2019s death in China have seemingly been exaggerated. According to Primitive Ventures founding partner Dovey Wan, an investor known for her insights into the Chinese market, China Merchant Bank has just announced an investment in BitPie, \u201cthe Bitcoin wallet with the longest history and most users in China.\u201d\n\nChina Merchant Bank, according to NewsBTC\u2019s knowledge, is a mid-sized financial institution in the nation with hundreds of branches. It\u2019s no small fish, that\u2019s for sure.\n\nChina\u2026 China Merchant Bank just announced invested in BitPie, the Bitcoin wallet with longest history and most users back in China \u2026 \ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude33 Tho it's a non-custodial wallet there can be a non-zero chance \u2026.[redacted] \ud83e\udd10\ud83e\udd10\ud83e\udd10 \u2014 Dovey \u4ee5\u5fb7\u670d\u4eba Wan \ud83d\udddd \ud83e\udd96 (@DoveyWan) October 28, 2019\n\nAccording to Wan\u2019s analysis, this is the start of the Chinese nationalization of the cryptocurrency and Bitcoin industry, which comes in response to President Xi\u2019s remarks and the massive public response thus far.\n\nIt is important to note that this isn\u2019t the first time that a Chinese bank has got its hands dirty with cryptocurrency. Earlier this year, The Bank of China \u2014 not to be confused with China\u2019s similarly-named central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China \u2014 released a fully-fledged article on Bitcoin.\n\nYesterday the #BankofChina posted up an article about #Bitcoin. They explained how $BTC works, why the price is going up, and why it\u2019s valuable. Never thought I\u2019d see that happen. \ud83d\ude05 #Bullish pic.twitter.com/GKzj7XJjJa \u2014 Samson Mow (@Excellion) July 27, 2019\n\nGargantuan Public Response\n\nThis seems to be a part of the gargantuan public and private response to President Xi\u2019s remarks. As reported by NewsBTC previously, China\u2019s state-controlled television station, CCTV.com, recently hosted a segment breaking down BTC, according to a prominent trader that closely follows the region\u2019s cryptocurrency scene.\n\nA Twitter user going by \u201cCL\u201d has tacitly corroborated the trend of Bitcoin returning to the mainstream in China. The analyst remarked in his own Twitter post that he noticed that the Chinese government \u201chas organized a nationwide blockchain exam competition,\u201d whose first class is literally titled \u201cApplication of Blockchain: Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg, though.\n\nBitcoin and blockchain are reentering the mainstream in China, this time with the support of their leader. Who knows what could happen next?\n\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "description": "On Friday, China\u2019s leader, President Xi Jinping, absolutely floored the Bitcoin community.
