But I keep coming back to one simple, underrated tool to catch those half-baked ideas and thoughts that don\u2019t seem to fit in anywhere else. The perfect place is the humble index card.\n\nSure, index cards have come and gone from our personal organisation systems. Fewer of us use them to, say, record family recipes, but index cards are still more than just the medium for making flash cards or noting key points before giving a speech. You might have heard of Getting Things Done (GTD), the system by which you write down every single to-do item so your brain doesn\u2019t need to juggle too much information at once. An extension of this system is using index cards to track daily tasks and records, record quotes you like, or note something you learned. You stick \u2018em all in a box, organised by date or type of note. It is fittingly called the Pile of Index Cards system.\n\nHere\u2019s where I go off the organisational rails. I use index cards for all my impractical notes. Reminders and to-dos go in my planner, research for a dedicated subject area goes in a Google Doc with a table of contents. But random, half-baked ideas go onto index cards. I keep them in a pile, but that pile is not organised. It\u2019s a big jumbly mess.\n\nI dabble in writing fiction and personal essays when I\u2019m not slinging money hacks, and the idea of keeping a dedicated notebook for the questions, one-liners, or short scenes that bubble up during daily life is intimidating. How many notebooks do you have tucked away with the first three pages filled out, only to be abandoned? I hate when I do that.\n\nThese Are The Best Note-Taking Apps We recently polled readers with suggestions for the best note-taking apps. Most of you said you still do things the old-fashioned way with pen and paper \u2014 a technique I heartily endorse. Read more\n\nSo, I took away the pressure of the blank page. Instead, an index card. It\u2019s a cosy space for my thoughts. If I\u2019m feeling tidy, I use the lined side. Feeling scribbly? I flip it over to the blank side. You can write in any direction, I don\u2019t care. Like GTD, it helps get the idea out of your head before your brain has the chance to forget about it.\n\nWhen I need some writing inspiration, I pull out the stack of cards. Most of them are cryptic, in writing no one can decipher but me. One of them simply says, \u201ckeys cut.\u201d Two words. I know what it means, and with the short space of an index card, I don\u2019t feel like I need to expand on the phrase on the remainder of a notebook page. I\u2019ll get to it later. I\u2019ll use it when I need it.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit like the project research process Twyla Tharp explained in her book, The Creative Habit. You start a new box for each project and all the materials, whether newspaper clippings, photographs, or notes, go into the box. You keep adding until the project has been completed, at which point you label the box and store it away.\n\nI thought I was just a Twyla-inspired oddball with my stack of index cards until I learned about comedian Phyllis Diller\u2019s gag file. It\u2019s a 48-drawer card catalogue, each one packed with decades of her jokes organised by category \u2014 about 40,000 jokes! Joke files aren\u2019t uncommon for comedians, but for me, it was the epiphany I needed to embrace my index cards. Diller owned her method. It\u2019s time to own mine, no matter how messy it may seem to others.\n\nThe organisational system that works best is the system that works for you. You can take inspiration from others and test out their methods, but you might eventually find you don\u2019t need anyone else to show you the way.", "description": "I\u2019ve tried Evernote and Scrivener, paper planners and Moleskines, and seemingly every app under the sun to capture my ideas.
