Cheri Bustos of Illinois, who chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n\n\"It sucks being in the minority, and a lot of these guys haven\u2019t been in the minority since \u201906, and they are fearful there isn\u2019t a lot of hope to get the majority back in this cycle,\u201d said Jeff Roe, a Republican political consultant who's worked with Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\nBut, but, but: \u201cIt\u2019s the best Republican seat in the country,\" Roe said of Thornberry's district. \"This isn\u2019t a Democrat seat.\u201d\n\nWhat they're saying: At the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin last week and in conversations this week, here's what Texas Republicans are telling us:\n\n\"Texodus\" has entered their lexicon \u2014 a term Democrats coined to describe the subsequent retirements of the state's GOP House members.\n\nMany \"headwinds\" are working against them, most notably shifting demographics and attitudes of suburban voters.\n\nThey talk openly about perceptions the party is run by a bunch of old white guys\u2014 and they're desperate to change that. \" The base is shrinking. Period. End of story,\" said Rep. Will Hurd, the only black House Republican, who at 42 will leave office rather seek another term representing his heavily Hispanic district in southwest Texas.\n\nThe base is shrinking. Period. End of story,\" said Rep. Will Hurd, the only black House Republican, who at 42 will leave office rather seek another term representing his heavily Hispanic district in southwest Texas. Hurd said Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and Dusty Johnson of South Dakota are two members trying to make the party more diverse and inclusive.\n\n\"We weren\u2019t doing our homework,\" said GOP consultant Susan Lilly, during a festival panel called \"The Republican do-over\" in Austin. \"Some members forgot about doing town hall meetings.\u201d But she said her clients \u2014 including Rep. Mike McCaul of Texas' 10th district \u2014 \"have woken up\" now.\n\nWhat to watch: Another Texas Republican strategist said to watch McCaul for another potential retirement. If he goes, he would be the 7th of the state's 23 House Republicans to retire at the end of this term.\n\nThe bottom line: It's truly a sign of the times that Democrats think Texas in 2020 could mimic California in 2018 \u2014 where the party picked up 7 GOP seats and helped Dems win back the House.", "description": "They can't coast to re-election anymore in what was a reliably red state.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/s-0c6Khw2S4IOmtr__YQqCcV7o0=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/10/01/1569891245635.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
