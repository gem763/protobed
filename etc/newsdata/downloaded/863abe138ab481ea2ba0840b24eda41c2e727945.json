I didn\u2019t think that it was that bad.\n\n\u201cWhen they said they had to take my legs, I just talked to myself \u2018Well they\u2019ve got to go, otherwise I\u2019m going to die,\u2019 and I just wanted to try to get back to as normal as possible, as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
