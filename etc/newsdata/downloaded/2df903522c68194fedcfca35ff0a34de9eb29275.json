UPDATE 1-South Africa's rand, stocks drift weaker in quiet trade\n\n(Adds latest figures)\n\nJOHANNESBURG, Oct 24 (Reuters) - South Africa's rand traded marginally weaker on Thursday, in line with global currency markets ahead of some important central bank meetings, and in the absence of new signals from the Sino-U.S. trade war and the Brexit saga.\n\nAt 1600 GMT, the rand ZAR=D3 traded at 14.6550 per dollar, 0.1% weaker.\n\nWithout local catalysts, the rand is expected to take direction from global markets.\n\nThe currency dipped slightly tracking the weaker euro, which fell after European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi gave his final news conference and data showed stagnating economic momentum in the euro zone.\n\nInvestors also await the U.S. Federal Reserve's meeting on Oct. 29 and 30, where it is expected to cut its benchmark interest rate for a third consecutive time this year.\n\nIn fixed income, the yield on the benchmark government bond due in 2026 ZAR186= fell 0.5 basis points to 8.21%.\n\nIn stocks, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange's blue-chip index closed 0.24% lower at 49,124 points while the broader all-share index was 0.17% weaker at 55,4789 points.\n\nGold miners were the biggest winners, with Exxaro Resources , AngloGold Ashanti and Goldfields topping the blue chip index and up 2.9%, 2.37% and 2.2%respectively.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum were banks and telecoms firms: Vodacom , off 2.14%, led the index downwards, followed by Standard Bank , which shed 2.13%, and Absa and FirstRand , both losing near to 1.5%.", "description": "UPDATE 1-South Africa's rand, stocks drift weaker in quiet trade", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPED1N0SS_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
