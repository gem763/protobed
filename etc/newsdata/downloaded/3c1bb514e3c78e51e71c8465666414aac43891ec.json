This is mainly because schools start too early.\n\nTeenagers need to sleep for at least eight to 10 hours every day to maintain a healthy lifestyle, according to experts. The fact is that most students have to get up around 6am during weekdays so that they can be in school by 8am. This is clearly unhelpful.\n\nTo have a good night\u2019s sleep, they have to go to bed by at least 10pm the day before. But this is mostly not possible because of the huge amount of revision and homework they have to do.\n\nMany people think students play video games late into the night and this is why they are sleep-deprived. I don\u2019t agree. The biggest issues are the school schedule and the heavy workload imposed by the teachers.\n\nThis problem can be solved if schools change the starting time to around 8.30am or 9am, along with fewer assignments for students. Parents can also try to encourage their children to sleep earlier.\n\nI hope more people, including education officials, pay attention to this serious matter.\n\nIsaac Zee, Diocesan Boys\u2019 School\n\nSorry: sleeping in at the weekend is unhealthy and doesn't repay weekday sleep debt\n\nFrom the Editor\n\nThank you for your letter, Isaac.\n\nThere have been suggestions that schools should start one or one-and-a-half hours later and end about an hour later so that students should have no problem getting at least eight hours\u2019 sleep every day. This also means they can sleep later if necessary and wake up later.\n\nBut no matter what time school starts, I believe students are still going to be stressed and feel they are working too hard. Some students even go to school on Saturdays because their teachers are unable to complete the syllabus in time. Can you imagine how tough it would be if the school day was shorter?\n\nI agree that local students are overwhelmed with revision and homework, but it all comes down to proper time management.\n\nHere\u2019s a tip: get rid of all the distractions that take your mind away from your work. For example, get off Facebook, Instagram and other social media. Many students spend way too much time on their phones.\n\nYou need to set up your day so that you can make the best use of your time.\n\nM. J.
