He said children suffering from starvation continue to struggle when their diet returns to normal and this is caused by an imbalance in the gut. Scientists will soon be able to 'smartly engineer intervention' to fix the good bacteria in the gut\n\nGiving a lecture at Cambridge University, Microsoft tycoon Mr Gates, 63, will say solving malnutrition could also help end the obesity epidemic in the West and prevent asthma, allergies and some autoimmune diseases.\n\nHe will stress: \u2018I get asked a lot what I would choose if I could only solve one problem. My answer is always malnutrition. It\u2019s the greatest health inequity in the world. Period. By solving malnutrition, we can fix one of the biggest contributors to inequity.\u2019\n\nThe Microsoft tycoon Gates will present the Hawking Fellowship lecture, at Cambridge University, which is named after Professor Stephen Hawking (pictured)\n\nMr Gates predicts over the next 20 years \u2018we will solve malnutrition and significantly reduce the number of nutrition-related deaths\u2019. He will say: \u2018If you don\u2019t get enough nutrition during the first three years of life, you don\u2019t develop properly \u2013 physically or mentally.\u2019 The businessman will give the Hawking Fellowship lecture \u2013 named after Professor Stephen Hawking who died in 2018. Gates used to discuss science with the professor.\n\nHe will say two forms of malnutrition are well\u2013understood \u2013 those caused by infections and a lack of nutrients. But a third cause remains a puzzle.\n\nBy focusing on improving gut health and malnutrition, we can we can 'focus on the biggest contributors to inequity', according to Gates (file image)\n\nChildren suffering from starvation often continue to struggle when their diet returns to normal. Mr Gates argues this is to do with an imbalance of bacteria in the gut. He insists the solution lies in a deeper understanding of the microbiome \u2013 good bacteria in the gut \u2013 and predicts scientists will be able to \u2018smartly engineer interventions\u2019 to fix microbiomes.\n\nMr Gates will say the breakthroughs will also have \u2018huge benefits for the rich world\u2019 in battling obesity, asthma, allergies and autoimmune diseases. \u2018Over and under-nutrition are two sides of the same coin. If we can figure nutrition out \u2013 and I believe we will within the next two decades \u2013 we\u2019ll save millions of lives and improve even more.\u2019 Mr Gates, who has spent years trying to help tackle malaria, will also say he believes the disease will be \u2018virtually eliminated\u2019 by 2040 through inserting genes into mosquitoes to stop them reproducing.", "description": "Bill Gates says scientists will 'smartly engineer intervention' to fix the good bacteria in the gut to help children who suffered starvation.
