But for those watching from outside and especially those who feel invested in the Terrapins\u2019 success, a glance at the schedule is frequently an all-too-common scavenger hunt: Find six wins.\n\nA bowl game stands as a milestone of success for programs such as Maryland that have typically ended their seasons just after Thanksgiving in recent years. In Michael Locksley\u2019s first year as the Terrapins\u2019 head coach, attaining bowl eligibility seemed somewhat realistic but also tricky given the Big Ten East staples on the schedule.\n\nMost calculations that added to at least six wins included a victory over Temple, the team Maryland lost to in Philadelphia two weeks ago. But though the Terps (2-1) now have to make up ground somewhere in their Big Ten schedule, they will find teams that have showed flaws and signs of vulnerability.\n\nAfter a bye week, a long but beneficial time to let the mistakes that cost them against the Owls simmer, the Terrapins will start conference play Friday night at home against No. 12 Penn State, a team that has outscored the Terrapins by a combined 104-6 in the past two meetings.\n\n[Terps running back Jake Funk out for the season with torn ACL]\n\nThe programs are tied together by proximity: Players from Maryland high school powers such as DeMatha and McDonogh appear on both teams\u2019 rosters, and both coaching staffs heavily recruit the D.C.-Maryland-Virginia region. But Penn State (3-0) has what Maryland doesn\u2019t: recent success. Though the Nittany Lions needed the help of Pittsburgh\u2019s questionable fourth-and-goal decision at the 1-yard line Sept. 14 to stay undefeated heading into its bye week, it has averaged nine wins per season the past five years compared with the Terrapins\u2019 five.\n\nPenn State holds a 39-2-1 advantage in the series, with Maryland\u2019s victories coming in 2014 and 1961.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got some work to do for us to be able to call it a rivalry,\u201d Locksley said Tuesday. \u201cYou can\u2019t wish and make a game a rivalry. The only way it gets to that point is by competing and having success. So I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s a rivalry yet, because we haven\u2019t been consistent enough or have won enough for us to even get to that point.\u201d\n\nThe Terps are still projected to reach the six-win benchmark, according to ESPN\u2019s Football Performance Index, an analytics-based, predictive ranking system that extends beyond the top 25. Maryland stands as the No. 29 team in FPI \u2014 behind four opponents still left on the schedule (Ohio State, Penn State, Michigan State and Michigan) and ahead of five (Nebraska, Minnesota, Indiana, Purdue and Rutgers). SP+, another predictive ratings system, has Maryland at No. 34, with the same four teams plus Indiana ranked ahead of them and the other four future opponents behind.\n\nFor the foreseeable future, Maryland\u2019s struggles will come from the four-team cluster of Big Ten East powers the Terps must play every season. Though Penn State struggled with Pittsburgh and both Michigan and Michigan State have show significant weakness on offense this season, they along with perennial College Football Playoff contender Ohio State remain the most talent-laced teams in the division and the ones Maryland needs to inch toward. In the past four seasons, Maryland is 1-15 against those teams.\n\n\u201cAs far as playing in the Big Ten East, it is one of the best conferences, the best leagues in all of college football,\u201d Locksley said at his introductory news conference in December. \u201cTremendous challenge.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why \u2014 despite hopeful rumblings from Maryland fans about the state of Michigan\u2019s program after its 35-14 drubbing at Wisconsin last weekend and the prospect of upsets seeming more promising after last year\u2019s overtime loss to Ohio State \u2014 the game of finding six wins on the Terps\u2019 schedule skews far more toward the next tier of programs. And that second tier hasn\u2019t done itself many favors to begin the season.\n\nNebraska, pegged as a preseason favorite to win the West, has a loss to Colorado and unconvincing wins over South Alabama and Illinois. Purdue, considered a team on the rise with consecutive bowl appearances under Coach Jeff Brohm, has lost twice in three games. Minnesota is 3-0, but the wins over South Dakota State, Fresno State and Georgia Southern have come by a total of 13 points.\n\nIn the Terps\u2019 first two games \u2014 a 79-0 win against Howard and a 63-20 result over then-ranked Syracuse \u2014 Maryland showed \u201chow good of a team that we can be,\u201d linebacker Shaq Smith said. If future performances more closely resemble these two than the Temple loss, which was fueled by offensive woes, it might not matter if the similarly tiered Big Ten programs turn out to be average or slightly below average.\n\nThe loss in Philadelphia didn\u2019t extinguish the buzz that engulfed the Maryland program after those two first wins. The stadium for the Penn State game is expected to be packed, albeit likely with a strong contingent of Nittany Lions fans. The school has added bleacher seating to accommodate high demand for student tickets.\n\nLocksley and the players downplay the matchup\u2019s marquee status, choosing to shelter themselves from hoopla that hasn\u2019t existed much around the program lately. A win against one of the top four Big Ten East programs, though, would mark the first for Maryland since 2016 (a 28-17 win over Michigan State), create a highlight in the nascent Locksley era and fast-track the program toward bowl eligibility.\n\nBut \u201cif we go out there and roll over,\u201d Smith said, \u201cthen it\u2019s not going to be a big game anymore.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nCollege football has Rivalry Week, Week Zero and now Redshirt Week\n\nAmid band drama, Iowa and Iowa State can\u2019t even agree whether rivalry game is in trouble\n\nUCLA-Washington State was a wild reminder: Really young people play football\n\nCollege football Week 4 winners and losers: Michigan is mashed, UCF\u2019s run ends", "description": "The Terps must make up ground in Big Ten play, starting with Penn State, to get to six wins.
