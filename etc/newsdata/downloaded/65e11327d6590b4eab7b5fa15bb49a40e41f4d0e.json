The moves won some support but other progressives like Doggett want more.\n\nEbola outbreak wanes, but funding lags\n\nIt's a good news, bad news with the Ebola outbreak. Global health officials are cautiously optimistic that an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in Congo is slowly coming under control after more than a year spent battling one of the most complex epidemics in modern history.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) and the Congolese health ministry said Friday that only 15 new cases of the Ebola virus had been identified in North Kivu and Ituri provinces in the last week. This marks the fourth straight week in which case counts have declined. As recently as April, the health ministry was reporting more than 100 new cases per week.\n\nBut money is hard to come by: Public health officials have warned that those scrambling to stop the outbreak are running low on money. The WHO has said it and partner groups need $394 million to continue running the response at a sufficient level through December, but that just $126 million has been received.\n\nThe WHO has asked wealthy nations to contribute $66 million for neighboring countries to prepare to fight the virus if it jumps international borders. Of that, only $4.5 million has been funded.\n\nMore on the challenges dealing with the outbreak here.\n\nJohnson & Johnson recalls batch of baby powder after asbestos traces found\n\nJohnson & Johnson is recalling a single lot of its Johnson's Baby Powder after small amounts of asbestos were found in a bottle purchased online.\n\nThe company said it was initiating the recall \"out of an abundance of caution.\" It is working with the Food and Drug Administration, which tested the product, and has begun to investigate how and when the product was contaminated.\n\nThe lot consists of 33,000 bottles. Customers who have a bottle in the affected lot are being urged to discontinue using it, and to contact the company for more information.\n\nJ&J insists its talc products are safe and noted the traces of asbestos were only found in one bottle, and were minute. However, the recall is sure to draw new scrutiny to the safety concerns surrounding the company's talc products.\n\nLate last year, the company launched a national ad campaign defending itself following an investigation from Reuters that said the company knew for decades its talc baby powder contained traces of asbestos.\n\nRead more about the recall here.\n\nDrugmaker recalls heartburn drug Zantac over cancer concerns\n\nThe drugmaker Sanofi announced Friday that it is recalling the heartburn drug Zantac in the United States and Canada because of concerns it could contain low levels of a cancer-causing chemical.\n\nThe company said in a statement that the recall was being conducted as a \"precautionary measure.\"\n\nIn September, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an alert that Zantac, which contains ranitidine, could contain low levels of the carcinogen nitrosodimethylamine.\n\nSome retailers, like CVS, then stopped selling the drug. Sanofi said it has decided to recall the drug \"due to inconsistencies in preliminary test results.\"\n\nThe company said that \"evaluations are ongoing.\"\n\nRead more here.\n\nWhat we're reading\n\nHow pending decision on ObamaCare could upend 2020 campaign (The New York Times)\n\nWith European backing, the world is on the brink of the first approved Ebola vaccine (Stat News)\n\nIt's time to choose a health plan.
