The clocks will still change on Sunday at 2 a.m.\n\nPremier John Horgan previously suggested B.C. will wait until similar efforts in other West Coast jurisdictions move forward.\n\nWashington state, Oregon and California are still awaiting congressional approval and U.S. legislators have indicated that could take time, given everything else that's going on in U.S. federal politics right now.\n\nB.C. currently observes Pacific standard time during the winter months and Pacific daylight time during the summer months.\n\nThe province says this new legislation will not require areas of northern B.C. and the Kootenays, which currently observe mountain time, to make any changes.", "description": "The B.C. government will introduce a bill on Thursday aimed at eventually making daylight time permanent across the province, ending the twice-yearly changes to and from standard time.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5047228.1561422885!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/aptopix-time-fall-back.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
