She has been painted once before, knocked off her rock, and decapitated\n\nEvery year around 800 pilot whales are herded into coves on the Faroe Islands before being stabbed to death during a hunt known as grindadrap - or 'the grind'.\n\nTraditionally a bonfire was lit when a pod of whales was spotted near the islands in order to alert fishermen to ready their boats.\n\nToday word spreads on social media before the vessels head out to drive the mammals into the shore.\n\nHunters armed with knives mounted on long poles then gather in a cove, where they kill the animals by severing their spinal chords and arteries.\n\nThe practice dates back at least 300 years. Locals say the whales are not under threat and the killings violate no laws.\n\nWorkers were quick to remove the paint, which appeared overnight on Monday. While the Faroe Islands are self-governing, they are still part of the Kingdom of Denmark\n\nThe mermaid statue was created by sculptor Edvard Eriksen and has sat at the entrance to Copenhagen harbour since 1913\n\nIslanders say the killings, usually carried out with a knife mounted on a long pole, breach no laws because the pilot whales are not endangered\n\nThe Faroe Islands comprises 17 inhabited islands located around 260 miles north of John O'Groats, Scotland.\n\nIn the 1940s the population voted to succeed from Denmark, but after the government failed to agree a deal the proposal was dropped in favour of laws allowing greater home rule.\n\nToday the islands are largely self-governing, though still technically part of the Kingdom of Denmark.\n\nPilot whales are highly sociable and intelligent creatures, and researchers believe they are capable of grief and may even possess their own culture.\n\nThe Faroese hunts rely on the whales' loyalty to work, as the mammals will attempt to defend each-other even while being hacked to death.", "description": "A 94-year-old Little Mermaid statue in Copenhagen, created in tribute to writer Hans Christian Andersen, has been vandalised by activists protesting the slaughter of whales.", "authors": ["Chris Pleasance For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/05/30/12/40EF53E500000578-0-image-a-98_1496144704076.jpg", "published_at": "2017-05-30"}
