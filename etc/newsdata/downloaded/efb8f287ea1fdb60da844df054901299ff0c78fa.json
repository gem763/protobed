His attack drew comparisons to the deadly Christchurch shooting rampage, in which 28-year-old white supremacist Brenton Tarrant slaughtered 51 people at a local mosque.\n\nBut the German\u2019s gun lacked the reliability and firepower of Tarrant\u2019s military-grade rifles, with the former frustrated by his weapon\u2019s repeated jams and failures.\n\nIn fact, technology to produce the craft gun is widely available to almost anyone who has basic plumbing skills, Maksim Popenker, a renowned Russian arms expert, told RT.\n\nBREAKING: PDF document, appearing to be manifesto of #Halle#Germany attacker Stephan Balliet, emerges online, showing pictures of the weapons and ammunition he used and reference to his live stream.

He believed that UK gun control laws were \u201cfascist\u201d, and created detailed instructions on how to make firearms from commercially available parts.\n\nPopenker, who has authored several books on Russian and Western small arms, says that unlike 3D-printed weapons \u2013 which widely use plastic elements \u2013 improvised guns made of metal \u201chave been around for quite a long time,\u201d and the necessary know-how can be found online and on paper.\n\nIndeed, a quick search through popular book-sharing websites reveal dozens of free-shipping manuals describing how to make \u201cimprovised weapons out of everyday objects for self-defense\u201d or \u201cdo-it-yourself basic homemade survival weapons.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com Halle\u2019s \u2018Nazi killer\u2019: How blind hatred fueled a deadly shooting spree in Germany\n\nWhat\u2019s more, there\u2019s virtually nothing that could stop the spread of such information online, says Otfried Nassauer, founder of Berlin Information Center for Transatlantic Security (BITS).\n\n\u201cThe censorship is ineffective because, once published, [such] information becomes available,\u201d he said, mentioning that even US field manuals available on the BITS website are dual-use \u2013 they could be useful for researchers, but also for those \u201cplanning to do a terror attack.\u201d\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
