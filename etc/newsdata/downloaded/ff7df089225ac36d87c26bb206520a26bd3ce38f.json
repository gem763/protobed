General Marcus Evans\n\nIt took months for CIA agents to narrow down the location of the notorious al-Baghdadi. He was finally tracked down following the arrest and interrogation of one of his wives and a courier this past summer, two American officials said to the Times.\n\nThe pair betrayed al-Baghdadi and surrendered small fractions of information that enabled American, Iraqi, and Kurdish forces to narrow down his whereabouts to Idlib.\n\nFollowing that tip the CIA worked closely with Iraqi and Kurdish intelligence officials in Iraq and Syria to find his precise locations and to embed spies to monitor his movements that led to the raid.\n\nOne official noted that the Syrian and Iraqi Kurds provided more intelligence for the raid than any single country did.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark T. Esper told ABC that he did not know if the United States would have been able to carry out the helicopter raid against Mr. Baghdadi\u2019s compound had American troops been completely withdrawn from Syria, as Trump had originally planned.\n\nRegardless, in his press conference earlier today, Trump insisted he has no regrets about withdrawing from the region.\n\nOfficials started to narrow down al-Baghdadi's location and plan the raid this past summer, but the operation to strike his hideout was nearly blown out of the water when President Trump abruptly decided to withdraw American troops from northern Syria.

Following the raid, American warplanes bombed his compound\n\nIn the hours since, the president has been slammed repeatedly for the declaration, a backlash led by democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.\n\n\u2018My understanding, interestingly enough, is that that mission was accomplished with information supplied by the Kurds, and as we know Trump has turned his back and betrayed the Kurds,\u2019 Sanders told reporters Sunday.\n\n\u2018I think that will have a negative impact, on not only that region of the world, but in terms of relationships with allies from one end of this planet to the other.\u2019\n\nOnline, President Trump featured in hundreds of similarly critical statements admonishing him for thanking Russia first over the Kurds, and taking credit for their diligent work.\n\n\u2018The success of the Al-Baghdadi operation was the result of a five month joint intelligence gathering on the ground by the Kurds and the US Intel community,\u2019 journalist Rula Jubreal tweeted. \u2018The Kurdish allies who helped the US get Al-Baghdadi were betrayed by Trump, who now takes credit for the Kurds\u2019 efforts.\u2019\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Aaron Blake made a similar conclusion, tweeting: \u2018One striking thing: Kurdish SDF said this was a joint operation. But Trump first thanks Russia, Syria, Turkey and Iraq, then mentioned \u201ccertain support [the Kurds] were able to give us\u201d.\u2019\n\nSen.

Online, President Trump featured in hundreds of similarly critical statements admonishing him for thanking Russia first over the Kurds, and taking credit for their diligent work.\n\nThe raid was launched around midnight Sunday morning, which was 5pm EST on Saturday in Washington D.C., where Trump was watching a feed of the strike from the White House Situation Room.\n\nIn the operation eight American helicopters, mostly CH-47 Chinooks took off from a military base near Erbil, Iraq.\n\nThe helicopters then flew low and fast to avoid detection, and were subjected to sporadic ground fire, in the perilous 70-minute flight. Once they arrived to their destination they released a hail of gunfire on a compound of buildings as a cover for commandos with the Delta Force and their military dogs.\n\nThe commandos then dismounted at al-Baghdadi's compound, blowing up one of its walls which allowed them to rush in. Once inside they confronted a group of ISIS fighters.\n\nThe Delta Force officers entered the compound where they shot and killed a number of people and removed 11 children from area.\n\nFearing capture al-Baghdadi ran into an underground tunnel taking three of his children with him while American troops were on his tail. Fearing he was armed with a suicide vest, which he was, the troops sent a military dog after him.\n\nIn the tunnel the Islamic State leader detonated his suicide vest, wounding the dog and killing the three kids.\n\nThe entire raid lasted around two hours, and involved just shy of 100 U.S. military personnel.\n\nIn Trump's description of the successful strike he said: 'I got to watch much of it. Al-Baghdadi died after running into a dead-end tunnel, whimpering and crying and screaming all the way.'\n\n'He died like a dog,' Trump added.\n\nAfter clearing out, American warplanes bombed the compound to assure it was physically destroyed. By 9pm Saturday in Washington D.C. Trump tweeted 'Something very big has just happened!'", "description": "The U.S. military operation to strike\u00a0ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was a success despite challenges posed by Donald Trump when he threatened to withdraw troops from Syria.", "authors": ["Luke Kenton For Dailymail.Com", "Marlene Lenthang For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/20/20253824-0-image-a-122_1572208041549.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
