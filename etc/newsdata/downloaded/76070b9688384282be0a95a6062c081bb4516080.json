Groups that knowingly flout the new rules could also face jail time.\n\n\u201cThere is simply no basis in the record for concluding that the Act will provide much benefit to Tennesseans,\u201d U.S. District Judge Aleta A. Trauger wrote in her judgment Thursday, \u201cand even less reason to think that any benefit will come close to outweighing the harms to Tennesseans (and non-Tennesseans) who merely wish to exercise their core constitutional rights.\u201d\n\nRepublicans who backed the bill said it was about maintaining fair elections. But soon after the bill was signed by Republican Gov. Bill Lee in May, civil-rights groups sued the state alleging that the measure was unconstitutional and that it discouraged people from helping others to sign up to vote, especially within African-American and other minority communities.\n\nHistorically, Tennessee has one of the lowest registration rates in the country, according to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Election Data + Science Lab.\n\nThe law would have gone in effect Oct. 1. Judge Trauger\u2019s injunction now puts it on pause as the lawsuit moves forward.\n\nGov. Lee declined to comment Thursday. Republican Secretary of State Tre Hargett didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn a March opinion piece, Mr. Hargett said the law would \u201cpreserve the integrity\u201d and security of the election progress. A last-minute surge in voter registration in the election last year in two counties was costly, he wrote, with many applications incomplete or containing incorrect and even false information.\n\nKristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, a Washington-based nonprofit that helped file the lawsuit, said Thursday\u2019s decision was important because it stopped \u201cunnecessary burdens\u201d on organizations focused on registering people to vote in low-income communities across the state.\n\n\u201cThere was no justification for the comprehensive burdens placed on the third-party organizations that are focused on addressing the staggeringly low registration rates across the state,\u201d Ms. Clarke said.\n\nWrite to Talal Ansari at Talal.Ansari@wsj.com", "description": "A federal judge in Tennessee temporarily blocked a new law restricting voter-registration drives in the state, saying its \u201ctroublingly vague\u201d provisions could undermine constitutional rights.", "authors": ["Talal Ansari", "Talal.Ansari Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106721/social", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
