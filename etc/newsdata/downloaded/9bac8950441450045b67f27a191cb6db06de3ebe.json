Saudi Arabia is the world's leading oil exporter.\n\nResponsibility was claimed by Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi group, which on Wednesday gave more details of the raid, saying it was launched from three sites in Yemen.\n\nIn a remark that may further strain an already tense political atmosphere in the Gulf, the Houthis also said they had dozens of sites in the United Arab Emirates, Riyadh's top Arab ally, listed as possible targets for attacks.\n\nIn an attempt to bolster its assertion that Iran was responsible, Saudi Arabia showed drone and missile debris it said amounted to undeniable evidence of Iranian aggression.\n\nA total of 25 drones and missiles were used in the attacks sponsored by Iran but not launched from Yemen, Defence Ministry spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki told a news conference.\n\n\"The attack was launched from the north and unquestionably sponsored by Iran,\" he said, adding Iranian Delta Wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) were used in addition to cruise missiles.\n\nAn investigation into the origin of the attacks was still under way and the result will be announced at a later date, he said.\n\nThe attack exposed gaps in Saudi air defences despite billions spent on Western military hardware.\n\nProof of Iranian responsibility, and in particular firm evidence that the attack was launched from Iranian territory, could pressure Riyadh and Washington into a response. Both nations, however, were stressing the need for caution.\n\nTrump has said he does not want war and is coordinating with Gulf and European states.\n\nCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, said the strike was a \"real test of the global will\" to confront subversion of the international order.\n\nHis envoy to London, Prince Khalid bin Bander, told the BBC the attack was \"almost certainly\" Iranian-backed: \"We're trying not to react too quickly because the last thing we need is more conflict in the region.\"\n\nThe Islamic Republic dismissed the allegations.\n\n\"They want to impose maximum ... pressure on Iran through slander,\" Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said.\n\n\"We don't want conflict in the region ... Who started the conflict?\" he added, blaming Washington and its Gulf allies for the war in Yemen.\n\nAn adviser to Rouhani, Hesameddin Ashena, said on Twitter the Saudi press conference indicated that Riyadh knows nothing about where the attack came from.\n\nYemen's Houthi movement, an ally of Iran battling a Western-backed, Saudi-led coalition for more than four years, said it used drones to assault state oil company Aramco's sites.\n\nThe raid exposed the vulnerability of Saudi Arabia's oil infrastructure and threw down a gauntlet to the United States, which wants to curb Iranian influence in the region. \"The attack is like Sept. 11th for Saudi Arabia, it is a game changer,\" said one Saudi security analyst.\n\n\"COMPELLING EVIDENCE\"\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo landed in Jeddah on Wednesday and was due to meet Prince Mohammed to discuss the crisis, before heading to the UAE.\n\nU.N. officials monitoring sanctions on Iran and Yemen were also heading to Saudi Arabia to investigate.\n\nFrance, which is trying to salvage an international nuclear deal with Iran that Washington quit last year, said it wanted to establish the facts before reacting.", "description": "JEDDAH/DUBAI, Sept 18 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a major increase in sanctions on Iran on Wednesday as Saudi Arabia displayed remnants of drones and missiles it said were used in a crippling attack on its oil sites \"unquestionably sponsored\" by Tehran.
