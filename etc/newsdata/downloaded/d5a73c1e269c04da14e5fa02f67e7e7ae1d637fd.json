The figure lands slightly above the second-quarter average of 41% and the year-ago average of 40%.\n\nYet the companies that missed analyst estimates in both categories were clobbered more than usual in public trading, underperforming the S&P 500 by 3.9 percentage points in next-day trading, the analysts found. Historically, companies underperform the index by 2.4 percentage points when they miss sales and earnings estimates.\n\nRead more: Goldman Sachs says these 5 trades can help investors make a killing during a crucial earnings season\n\nThe companies beating both estimates outperformed the index by 1.6 percentage points, falling in line with the historical average.\n\nThe worse-than-usual punishment could reflect a lack of long-term confidence among traders, with third-quarter misses signaling a prolonged downturn. The analysts also found mentions of words like \"better\" or \"stronger\" against \"weaker\" or \"worse\" hitting the lowest gap since 2009, which could be a result of continued trade tensions and souring global economic outlook.\n\nEarnings of the 75 companies to report were 2% above consensus estimates, with healthcare and consumer discretionary companies delivering strong beats. Banks performed in line with estimates despite macroeconomic indicators warning otherwise and recent Fed rate cuts squeezing profit margins.\n\nThe current trends are subject to change, especially with 36% of S&P firms slated to report their third-quarter earnings in the week starting Monday. Mega-cap stocks like Microsoft and Amazon will announce their latest figures, and more than half of communication services and energy companies will report as well.\n\nNow read more markets coverage from Markets Insider and Business Insider:\n\nWall Street is sounding the alarm as a key source of stock-market buying evaporates\n\nThe Fed's $60 billion monthly cash injections aren't enough to solve recent money-market stresses, JPMorgan says\n\nBillionaire Howard Marks gives his best advice for navigating an anomalous market where 30% of the world's debt has a negative yield", "description": "Third-quarter earnings season is a couple weeks underway, and Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts found that companies that missed sales and profit exp...", "authors": ["Finanzen.Net Gmbh"], "top_image": "https://images.markets.businessinsider.com/image/5dadddf3cc4a0a04346e3834-2400/2019-08-28t073440z1lynxnpef7r0khrtroptp4usa-stocks.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
