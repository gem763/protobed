When you're in the Army you have three meals a day, you're surrounded by your whole platoon.\n\n'You're with 30 or 40 people, and then when you leave you're sort of by yourself. They ask you where you want a train ticket to and that's it.'\n\nAfter leaving the Army, Leon was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and was allocated a psychiatrist and prescribed anti-depressants, but he still felt he didn't have anyone to talk to.\n\nLeon told how he missed being surrounded by 30 or 40 other members of his platoon - and after being diagnosed with PTSD he found it difficult to talk to anyone other than his fellow soldiers\n\nAfter cutting off all communication with his family, Leon lived alone in the woods with his dog for 13 weeks with no human contact, trying to cope with his PTSD\n\nHe explained: 'It got to a point where I got suicidal. The doctors, it's easy for them to just put you on tablets and you're out the door.\n\n'They don't really help, for the long course it doesn't help.'\n\nAfter cutting off all communication with his family, Leon lived alone in the woods with his dog for 13 weeks with no human contact, trying to cope with his PTSD.\n\nHe said: 'At about 13 weeks of being in the tent I sort of felt OK again. I had no phone or letters and I was just happy again and normal.'\n\nLeon urged viewers to buy a poppy from a collector across the UK this year and insisted that without the charity, he would still be homeless\n\nLeon now works as a chef at the Hillbark Hotel in Wirral and has found love with girlfriend Maisie\n\nIt was only when the cold temperatures prevented him from remaining in the tent that he decided to phone the British Legion.\n\nHe said: 'It was December, it was raining, and me and my dog were getting wet and I just rang them and they helped. Within two days I had a deposit on a flat and the first month's rent.\n\n'Life's better now, I have a two-bedroom house and a beautiful girlfriend. I'm a chef in the UK's smallest five star hotel.'\n\nThe former soldier urged viewers to buy a poppy from a collector across the UK this year and insisted that without the charity, he would still be homeless.\n\n'I would have been in the same lifestyle in the hostels,' he said. 'People don't realise what buying a poppy could do.'", "description": "Leon Parker, 20, from Wirral, revealed how his life was saved by the British Legion after he was diagnosed with PTSD when he left the Army, and spent 13 weeks living in a tent in the woods.", "authors": ["Monica Greep For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/11/20126342-0-image-a-38_1571912752908.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
