Thirty minutes into the operation, the lighthouse had been moved 1.4 meters.\n\nThe area is known for constantly shifting sands and an eroding coastline.\n\nIn 2008, a nearby church was dismantled to prevent it from falling into the sea. The Romanesque Maarup Church, built on a cliff around 1250, was picked for scenes in Babette's Feast, which in 1987 became the first Danish film to win the Oscar for best foreign language film.\n\nAP", "description": "A 120-year-old lighthouse in north-western Denmark has been put on wheels and rails in a bid to move it more than 250ft away from the North Sea amid the threat of coastal erosion.
