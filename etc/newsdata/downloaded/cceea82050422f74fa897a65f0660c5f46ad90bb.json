BBC's Chris Fox discovered that Face Unlock worked even when the user had their eyes shut.\n\nSecurity experts were quick to point out that this could lead to abuse, with family members, significant others, or attackers unlocking devices while the owner was asleep or out cold.\n\nTo make matters worse, a leak in the previous weeks showed that the Face Unlock settings page included an option named \"Require eyes to be open.\" The option was not included in Pixel 4 devices sent to reviewers and journalists ahead of the Pixel 4's official launch on October 24.\n\nBut in an email to ZDNet, Google said it's working on an update to address this issue. In the meantime, the company recommends that users enable one of the alternative methods of securing Pixel devices, such as using PIN codes, passphrases, or unlock patterns.\n\nThe issue isn't likely to have a big impact on the Pixel 4's launch. As Google said, users can simply use another screen-locking method until a patch arrives in the coming months.\n\nGoogle full statement is below:", "description": "In the meantime, Google recommends that users employ another screen-locking mechanism, such as passphrases, PIN codes, or swipe patterns.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/15/2c6a83f7-8fd0-4565-a4c5-95e5261f9632/thumbnail/770x578/6f9b2385facae30b552d05f8f2d555c4/pixel-4-collage.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
