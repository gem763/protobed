The fatality is the second in three days and the sixth since the start of the fall meeting on Oct. 19. On Friday, mare GQ Covergirl was also euthanized after sustaining an injury to her front legs.\n\nThe park had enlisted a track consultant in March to lead a study of the track surface, and the California Horse Racing Board has also performed multiple investigations.\n\nThe death comes just days before the famous track, located outside Los Angeles, is set to host the Breeders\u2019 Cup world championships this Friday and Saturday. There were discussions about moving the race, which is amongst the world\u2019s biggest and richest, however, the event\u2019s board voted unanimously to keep it at Santa Anita.", "description": "Bye Bye Beautiful was euthanized after injuring her legs during a race.
