Democrats say Trump\u2019s actions jeopardized national security and the integrity of U.S. elections.\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s complaint cited a telephone call in which Trump asked President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to launch an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden, a leader among Democrats seeking to challenge Trump in 2020, and his son Hunter. Hunter Biden sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nThe July 25 phone call came shortly after the United States froze nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine, prompting concern that Trump was using the taxpayer money already approved by Congress as leverage for his personal political gain.\n\nThe complaint said White House lawyers directed that an electronic summary of the call be moved from the place where such things are usually kept to a secret server reserved for covert matters.\n\n\u201cIf those conversations with Putin or with other world leaders are sequestered in that same electronic file that is meant for covert action, not meant for this, if there\u2019s an effort to hide those and cover those up, yes we\u2019re determined to find out,\u201d Schiff said on NBC.\n\nSchiff did not say whether he plans to subpoena that information. The White House did not respond to a request for comment on Schiff\u2019s statement that he wanted access to the call summaries.\u201d\n\nThe Ukraine scandal cast a shadow over Trump\u2019s presidency just months after the conclusion of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of whether the Trump campaign worked with Russia to help him win the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThat investigation concluded that Moscow waged a social media and propaganda campaign aimed at putting Trump in the White House. The Mueller report, released in April, laid out numerous contacts between Russian officials and Trump\u2019s campaign, but found no evidence of a criminal conspiracy.\n\nThe Ukraine matter prompted Democratic House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi to launch an impeachment inquiry against Trump on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cDEEP STATE OPERATIVE\u201d\n\nPolls show an increase in support for Trump\u2019s impeachment last week, and Democrats say they think voters are turning their way. Republican leaders maintain the inquiry will backfire.\n\nTrump says there was nothing wrong with his phone call with the Ukrainian leader and denounced the whistleblower as a \u201cpolitical hack.\u201d\n\nWhite House adviser Stephen Miller took up the attack on Sunday, accusing the whistleblower of being part of a \u201cdeep state\u201d government conspiracy to foment opposition to Trump.\n\n\u201cI know the difference between a whistleblower and a \u2018deep state\u2019 operative. This is a \u2018deep state\u2019 operative pure and simple,\u201d he told \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s Republican supporters in Congress defended the president\u2019s actions on Sunday TV news shows. \u201cI have zero problems with this phone call,\u201d Senator Lindsey Graham said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s complaint was deemed credible by the inspector general of the U.S. intelligence community and the acting director of national intelligence told lawmakers the person \u201cacted in good faith\u201d and \u201cdid the right thing.\u201d\n\nThe intelligence committee has reached an agreement with the whistleblower to appear before the panel, Schiff told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d Schiff said he hoped it would be very soon.\n\nLawmakers were working out logistics to protect the person\u2019s identity and get security clearance for lawyers who represent the whistleblower. A person close to the whistleblower said on Sunday many issues remained to be worked out.\n\nHouse committees on Friday issued a subpoena to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for documents concerning contact with the Ukrainian government. They also scheduled depositions for five State Department officials.\n\nFILE PHOTO - U.S. House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff (R-CA) talks to reporters after testimony from Acting Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Joseph Maguire about the handling of the whistleblower complaint on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., September 26, 2019.
