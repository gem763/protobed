I 100% knew Nate wasn't taking anything to cheat. #UFC244 November 2, MSG. #BMF pic.twitter.com/U9VEOPT0Ul \u2014 Dana White (@danawhite) October 26, 2019\n\nUSADA, the United States anti-doping body, has now cleared Diaz so he is eligible to compete at the event. UFC released a statement saying: 'On October 24, 2019, Nate Diaz released a public statement regarding a recent out-of-competition test conducted by USADA.\n\n'UFC has been notified by USADA that the out-of-competition test concluded that LGD-4033 was present in Mr. Diaz\u2019s sample at an amount below the decision concentration level for this substance.\n\n'USADA is reviewing the out-of-competition test as an atypical finding. Further laboratory testing conducted by the Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory (SMRTL), a WADA-accredited lab in Salt Lake City, Utah, has confirmed that two bottles of the same organic, vegan, plant-based daily multivitamin that Mr. Diaz was using were each contaminated with LGD-4033, which the evidence supports resulted in Mr. Diaz\u2019s positive sample.\n\n'Mr. Diaz has not committed an anti-doping policy violation, has not been provisionally suspended and is not subject to any sanctions.\n\nUFC President Dana White has confirmed the fight in New York will go ahead as planned\n\n'Additionally, UFC has been informed by independent experts who have determined that there is unequivocally no appreciable performance enhancing or therapeutic benefit from the significantly limited amount of LGD-4033 that may be present in his system, which is roughly 10,000 times lower than one LGD-4033 therapeutic dose.'\n\nThe fight for the new 'Baddest Motherf****r Belt' will take place as planned on November 2 at Madison Square Garden in New York.\n\nDiaz, who was apparently asked to stay quiet about his drug test results, tweeted out a heated statement on Thursday when he thought he would not be able to compete.\n\n'I'm not gonna make it out to NYC for fight week next week because they say I tested with elevated levels that they say might be from some tainted supplements,' he said.\n\n'I call false on that cause I only take Whole Food or natural supplements. I don't even eat meat.\n\n'So until UFC, USADA or whoever is F*****G with me fixes it, I won't be competing.'\n\nDiaz took to Twitter to tell his fans the news over the failed test and that he won't compete\n\nHe also hit out at advice given to remain silent on the test results, saying he is not a 'cheater'\n\nThe Stockton-born fighter made reference to other fighters who have tested positive in the past but still gone on to fight, saying doing so would be cheating.\n\n'I'm not gonna play their game and try and hide it or keep quiet, as they suggested. I'm not gonna have my name tainted as a cheater like these other motherf***ers who keep quiet until after the fight just so they can get paid. F*****g cheaters.\n\n'I don't give a f*** about some money over my dignity and my legacy. I'm not playing along with this b*******.\n\n'I'm not staying quiet and figuring it out after the fight. That's cheating. So fight game I'll see you when I see you. Sincerely, the realest baddest mother f***er in the game.'", "description": "The fight now seems to be back on, with UFC chief Dana White posting the fight's poster to social media along with the caption 'I 100% knew Nate wasn't taking anything to cheat.'", "authors": ["Matt Porter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/08/20157618-0-Nate_Diaz_has_said_that_he_has_falsely_tested_positive_for_eleva-a-29_1572074665178.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
