Gov. Phil Murphy and local students were among the first to check it out.\n\nReporters and photographers from NorthJersey.com and the USA TODAY NETWORK New Jersey were there too with a comprehensive look at American Dream. Here are some of our takeaways:\n\nThere's still a long way to go\n\nMurphy said it best.\n\n\"This is a journey that we\u2019re all still on,\u201d the governor said while at the site Friday.\n\nAmerican Dream looked very much like the work in progress it remains. There were plenty of construction workers around, plus tiles piled on the ground and an aroma of fresh paint in the air.\n\nMany of the attractions are still in the works, with the indoor water park, snow slope and shops and dining planned for the coming months.\n\nParking was confusing\n\nWhen one of the guests says he wished he left a trail of candy to find his way back to his car, it's not ideal.\n\n\u201cI should\u2019ve brought M&M\u2019s to track how I got here from my car,\u201d said Bob Kahn as he recalled his trek to the entrance.\n\nCones blocked the way drivers were led to by signs, and after that there were no directions at all. Parking was not much clearer, and will also cost you after the opening weekend.\n\nAlternatively there's a bus running directly from Port Authority to American Dream, plus several other routes.\n\nAmerican Dream is here: Inside the mega mall opening\n\nMore: American Dream Nickelodeon Universe giant indoor theme park sells out for first weekend\n\nIt's a great place to get your '90s nostalgia fix\n\nIf Nickelodeon's lineup from the late 1990s into the early 2000s defined your childhood, prepare to feel like a kid again.\n\nThe Nicktoons from that era are heavily featured in the park. \"Rugrats,\" \"Hey Arnold\" and \"Invader Zim\" plus the infamous slime can be seen throughout the amusement park portion of American Dream.\n\nThe displays had a wide array of characters, not just the most popular ones. Even our host and food reporter Rebecca King was stumped by Olmec from \"Legends of the Hidden Temple.\"\n\nThe displays move into the 2000s with \"SpongeBob\" and \"The Fairly OddParents.\" The newer generation gets its share too with a \"PAW Patrol\" display.\n\nYou'll have plenty of Instagram opportunities\n\nSpeaking of nostalgia, you can easily pose with \"Rugrats\" figurines. You can sit next to Grandpa Lou, ride on Spike's back or stand next to Angelica.\n\nBoomerangs of the rides and check-ins at the long-awaited attractions will be hard to resist. Plus, who can turn down a chance to post a meme about the length of the construction.\n\nStory continues below video\n\nThe skating rink is HUGE\n\nIt's NHL size after all.\n\nHearing that and seeing it for yourself are two different things though. Once you see the Zamboni cleaning the ice you really appreciate its size.\n\nThe ice rink is free for opening weekend, but prices afterward were not immediately available. The rink will include open skating, figure skating and hockey tournaments. A Halloween skate is also scheduled for the holiday.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/experience/america/theme-parks/2019/10/26/american-dream-opening-parking-skating-rink-more-day-1-highlights/2468379001/", "description": "From parking, construction, nostalgia and everything else, we learned plenty on American Dream's first day, with more to come.", "authors": ["Joshua Jongsma", "Published A.M.
