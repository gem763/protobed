'It was excruciating to see the PSA filmed, because I dip into personal, old places to help to bring an emotional context to it.'\n\nTwo versions of the campaign were created to send a message of anti-cyberbullying to viewers.\n\nThe first video follows a high school student named Hailey whose health slowly deteriorates throughout the two-minute ad.\n\nFirst, she expresses feeling ill and is unable to sleep, eat, or attend school towards the end of the ad. Then, in a heartbreaking moment, the high school student reaches for a bottle of pills that land her in the emergency room while doctors attempt to revive her.\n\nThroughout the entire ad there is no hint of what could possibly be ailing the high school student, just that it remains a mystery. The ad, called The Epidemic, encourages viewers to go to its website to unveil the mystery.\n\nEntering a phone number on the web page then unlocks a new ad that shows the same scenes from the first one but also shows text messages Hailey is receiving from her classmates.\n\nThese hurtful messages heighten to the point where classmates encourage her to end her life, demonstrating a stark message of how cyberbulling can be 'silent' to those around you but impactful on people's lives.\n\nBehind-the-scenes: A second ad with the video shows the messages the student is receiving from classmates\n\nHeartbreaking: The point of the ad is to show how cyberbullying is not always apparent to people around them. It hopes to raise awareness of the growing epidemic\n\nDistressing: Monica admitted the PSA is 'hard to see' for viewers because of the message\n\nEmotional: 'It was excruciating to see the PSA filmed, because I dip into personal, old places to help to bring an emotional context to it,' Monica said about the campaign\n\nMonica told Glamour the purpose of the ad was to capture 'that cascading feeling, that overwhelming feeling, the tsunami of texts that come in and the vitriol.'\n\nViewers are taken on a journey with the high schooler where they are also experiencing the bullying from her classmates.\n\nWhen speaking to Refinery29, Monica wanted to encourage people to not engage with cyberbullying in an attempt to help 'cure' this epidemic.\n\nPersonal reason: She has taken on an anti-cyberbullying platform after her affair with President Bill Clinton was revealed in 1998, which plummeted her into the spotlight\n\n'Like a disease, it\u2019s contagious and spreading \u2014 infecting our society. The cure is not engaging and clicking with compassion,' she said.\n\n'This PSA is hard to see. The signs of cyberbullying can also be hard to see \u2014we have instant recognition for physical pain, but less so with emotional pain. It can be hard to really understand the pain caused by online harassment...This PSA educates people through an emotional and devastating experience, in hopes that they'll better understand the consequences.'\n\nShe continued: 'Lastly, when you're the target, it can be hard to see that you can survive this.'\n\nIn the recent years, Monica has used her platform to target cyberbullying and aim to end the growing epidemic.\n\nThis comes after Monica was launched into the spotlight in the 1990s when her affair with President Bill Clinton was revealed. Her name became a punchline in news headlines, and even made its way into song lyrics, following the scandal.\n\nPreviously during a 2015 Ted Talk, Monica described herself as 'patient zero' for what has become the internet culture and the growth of cyberbullying.\n\nCampaigns like the one released following cyberbullying is Monica's attempt to help people when dealing with the epidemic and inspire change on how online comments are treated.\n\n'My hope is that \u2014 while we're helping targets or victims feel less alone and get help sooner, while we're aiming to shift the culture and psychology that leads to this kind of behavior, while we're considering legislative inroads \u2014 a social media platform develops that has more compassion and empathy baked in to the design and intended use,' she said.", "description": "Monica shared her third ad showing the 'real-life consequences' of cyberbullying.
