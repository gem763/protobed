Southgate feels this is key.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve made a bigger statement than any team ever has done within international football,\u201d the England manager said. \u201cSo I think we\u2019ve tried to maintain some dignity, we\u2019ve had the game stopped twice and we\u2019ve made everybody in Europe and around the world aware that this is an issue that we weren\u2019t prepared to accept, and the players have made a massive statement with their football as well.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

We felt we were giving the authorities an opportunity to, which I think they did, 50 or so supporters got thrown out. But, the conversations amongst ourselves were look, we weren\u2019t confident that we would be finishing the game. You know, we were sat [there] 10 minutes from half time, Steve [Holland] and myself saying: \u2018I don\u2019t think we are going to finish this game.\u2019\n\n\u201cWe knew that if we came off the pitch, we probably wouldn\u2019t be going back on and we were very clear, as a group at half time, that if anything happened in the second half, we would discuss this with the ref and he was also clear that everyone was going off.\n\n\u201cThe problem with fans and racist issues, in the past it hasn\u2019t worked and tonight it has worked.\n\n\u201cI think I have to give our organisation credit in that right from the moment we walked off the pitch in Montenegro, we reviewed what happened there, we knew that we needed to be better prepared as a group of staff to support the players the best we could. So, I couldn\u2019t have felt more strongly supported by the chairman, chief executive and federation, and I think the players have felt that.\n\n\u201cUefa were definitely on alert tonight and the fourth official and the referee and linesmen were on alert. So I think it\u2019s as big an operation as there has been. The sad reality is that we weren\u2019t able to stop incidents happening, and so now something clearly within the investigation has got to take that next step with regard to that, because it\u2019s remarkable to have such a spotlight on a game and for that all to happen. But sadly, from a societal perspective, that seems to be what we\u2019re dealing with.\u201d", "description": "Gareth Southgate feels the England\u00a0players have made a \u201cbigger statement\u201d than any team ever has in having their 6-0 win over Bulgaria stopped twice for racist abuse and choosing to play on, and believes it is an illustration that the approaches to the issue might finally work.", "authors": ["Miguel Delaney"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/15/14/Gareth-Southgate.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
