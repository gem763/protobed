But it was a close call, and Mike Pence is a great guy, and I\u2019m just grateful I had the opportunity to serve in the White House for more than three years.\u201d\n\nHe won\u2019t go away quietly to lick his wounds. He won\u2019t delete his Twitter \u00adaccount. He won\u2019t make it easy on anyone. He will vent his anger and resentment at every opportunity. It will be \u201chuman scum\u201d every single day.\n\nAnd it isn\u2019t as though the media is going to lose its interest in the most luridly telegenic politician that we have ever seen. The mainstream press would be \u00addelighted to see Trump \u00addestroyed yet sad to bid him farewell. The obvious way to square the circle would be to continue to give Trump lavish coverage in his post-presidency. He\u2019d be out of the White House but still driving screaming CNN chyrons every other hour.\n\nIn other words, Trump\u2019s removal wouldn\u2019t be a fresh start for Pence and the GOP; it would be more like getting stuck in the poisonous epilogue of the Trump era, awaiting the inevitable advent of the Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden or Pete Buttigieg era.", "description": "", "authors": ["Rich Lowry", "Nypost.Com Its-A-Total-Fantasy-To-Think-Republicans-Will-Abandon-Trump-Now"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
