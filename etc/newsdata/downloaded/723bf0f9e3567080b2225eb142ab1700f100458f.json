White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said the resolution shows the process is a \u201csham\u201d and unfair to the president.\n\nThe House will vote on the resolution on Thursday.\n\nMr. Trump said even a \u201ccasual reading\u201d of the transcript of his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u201cleads EVERYBODY to see that the call \u2026 was a totally appropriate one.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are accusing Mr. Trump of abusing his office by pressuring Ukraine\u2019s leader to investigate Democratic frontrunner Joseph R. Biden. Mr. Zelensky has said publicly he didn\u2019t feel pressured in the call.\n\n\u201cThis Impeachment nonsense is just a continuation of the Witch Hunt Hoax, which has been going on since before I even got elected,\u201d Mr. Trump said. He urged GOP lawmakers to \u201cgo with Substance and close it out!\u201d\n\nLawmakers heard testimony Tuesday from Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman of the White House National Security Council, who said he was concerned about the July 25th phone call crossing a line into partisan politics. He also said he tried to get a few missing details from the conversation placed back into the White House\u2019s transcript of the call, according to The New York Times.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
