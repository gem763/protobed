USA TODAY\n\nWhat caused Nicole \u201cSnooki\u201d Polizzi to go running out into the Point Pleasant Beach night this summer at the Jersey Shore?\n\nThe reading of one of her texts by \"Jersey Shore Family Vacation\" castmate Angelina Pivarnick.\n\nIf that doesn't make sense, well, the rest of Thursday's episode didn't seen to make much sense, either. Things quickly deteriorated into a screaming match between several cast members at a house on the Point Pleasant Beach boardwalk.\n\nThe two main combatants were Jenni \u201cJWoww \u201c Farley and Angelina, but then that splintered off into JWoww vs. Ronnie Ortiz-Magro and Angelina vs. Snooki. The hijinks between Angelina and JWoww's boyfriend, \u201c24,\u201d two episodes ago precipitated the shouting match that looked and sounded a lot more like \u201cThe Real Housewives of New Jersey\u201d than \u201cJersey Shore.\u201d\n\nNew charges against 'Jersey Shore' star Ronnie Ortiz-Magro include domestic violence\n\nJenni 'JWoww' Farley 'hurt' by what she saw on new episode of 'Jersey Shore'\n\nBrush ups on \u201cJersey Shore\u201d tend to happen in nightclubs, or on the sidewalks outside of nightclubs. Not at the dinner table\n\n\u201cEverything that needed to come out, is coming out all at once,\u201d said Paul \u201cPauly D\u201d DelVecchio.\n\n'Jersey Shore' Ronnie Ortiz-Magro tased, detained by police on domestic violence charges\n\nJenni \"JWoww\" Farley, Nicole \"Snooki' Polizzi and Angelina Pivarnick at Teak Restaurant and Bar in Red Bank on Aug. 22, 2019.

He's the host of the @UNnormalized entertainment, news and culture podcast \u201cShe didn\u2019t say who it was she as talking about but she walked up our street screaming and yelling that she didn\u2019t want to be there anymore. She wanted to be with a her baby and her kids.\u201d\n\nThe new Jersey Shore house in Point Pleasant Beach. (Photo: Chris Jordan)\n\nA producer quickly followed Snooki out of the house and then castmates \u201cJWoww\u201d and Pauly D came running out, along with a cameraman, Adao said.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think it would go this his way,\u201d Pauly D said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t go the way I expected it to be.\u201d\n\nLater, Snooki said she indeed left the house because she missed her kids. Snooki, 31, had baby No. 3, Angelo James, on May 30 with husband Jionni Lavalle. The baby was just over two months old when the episode was filmed.\n\n\u201cAngelina giving me crap, because that did happen, I can\u2019t tell you what it\u2019s about,\u201d Snooki said on her YouTube channel in a video published in August. \u201cShe\u2019s coming at me. And in my head I\u2019m thinking \u2013 mind you, I had, like, two bottles of wine \u2013 but in my head I'm thinking I didn\u2019t leave my kids to deal with this high school drama. And I got up and walked out.\u201d\n\nThe end of the episode left things very much unresolved, but at least there's a silver lining.\n\n\u201cThe house that Nicole got for us last time, it was in Manalapan, it was off the Shore,\u201d Pauly D said. \u201cThere was no water, like, where was the Shore? This time it's one on the Shore. It's amazing.\u201d\n\n\u201cJersey Shore Family Vacation\" airs Thursday's on MTV (8 p.m. EDT/PDT).\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/25/jersey-shore-family-vacation-jwoww-angelina-snooki-meltdown/2453058001/", "description": "Things quickly deteriorated into a screaming match between several cast members on Thursday's episode of \"Jersey Shore Family Vacation.\"", "authors": ["Chris Jordan", "Published A.M.
