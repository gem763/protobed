The judge also determined that some of the defense\u2019s evidence and witness testimony lacked credibility.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious to the court that plaintiff met her burden of proving it was more likely than not that she was subjected to employment discrimination on account of her pregnancy,\u201d Wood wrote in a court order, the newspaper reported.\n\nScott-Allen worked at Per Se for five years before requesting a transfer to Keller\u2019s Napa Valley restaurant. She claimed she was let go after telling her bosses she was pregnant.\n\nKeller was named as an individual defendant in the lawsuit because he owns and controls the two restaurants.\n\nThe French Laundry said it plans to appeal the judge\u2019s decision, saying in a written statement to the newspaper that it was deeply disappointed by \u201cthe decision to reopen the case that fully exonerated Thomas Keller\u201d and his restaurants.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A California judge has ordered a retrial in a pregnancy discrimination case brought against the Thomas Keller Restaurant Group.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/11/thomas_keller_lawsuit_25509_c0-233-5573-3482_s1770x1032.jpg?d8801d8c53601d60ba8a0ee3982c016ad8c3b5c1", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
