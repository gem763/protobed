Graffiti accuses others of lies and treason. In the most extreme cases, some MPs have received death threats.\n\nOver the summer, the contingent of first-time MPs from civil society and business who joined Macron's unexpectedly successful ticket in 2017 faced a wave of blowback against his support for EU free-trade deals with Canada and South America's Mercosur bloc.\n\nIn an age of surging popular opposition to globalization, and to many of the tenets of representative democracy itself, the physical and verbal attacks on lawmakers from Macron's La R\u00e9publique En Marche party highlight the struggle to push forward his economically and socially liberal, pro-European agenda.\n\n\"I do not exclude that one day we will see physical violence against an elected official,\" said lawmaker Jean-Baptiste Moreau, a cattle farmer-turned-MP who is now a spokesperson for the LREM parliamentary group and a supporter of the free-trade agreement with Canada, known as CETA.\n\nLREM lawmakers are accused by their detractors of rubber-stamping any legislation the government sends their way with little, if any, debate.\n\nA \"Wanted\" poster with his face on it was plastered around the town of Gu\u00e9ret in mid-August. He pressed charges, but even before the appearance of the poster and the CETA vote in July, Moreau already had police patrols checking on his family during his trips to Paris because of the threat of violence from the Yellow Jackets.\n\nFor Moreau, it's not just a question of his family's safety.\n\n\"Democracy is at stake,\" he said. \"Some colleagues may vote against Mercosur or other texts in the future just to avoid facing this kind of violence.\"\n\nViolent disagreement\n\nViolent protest is certainly not new in France, as MPs from longer-established parties can attest, though social media has made it easier to launch mass, anonymous, verbal attacks on politicians. But many of Macron's MPs are political neophytes who were not previously exposed to such intensive public scrutiny and conflict.\n\nHaving surfed to power on Macron's unlikely presidential victory, they are accused by their detractors of rubber-stamping any legislation the government sends their way with little, if any, debate.\n\nThe MPs, however, insist that while the LREM group, which holds an absolute majority in the National Assembly, does meet to decide on voting guidelines, they are free to make their own decisions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a collective discussion at group meetings on which position to take on each law, in connection with the government, but sincerely I have the freedom to decide, especially on issues that weren\u2019t in the campaign program,\" said first-term LREM lawmaker Christophe Jerretie.\n\nHe was mayor of Naves for three years before getting into parliament in 2017, and represents Corr\u00e8ze, where the cattle industry is a top employer \u2014 meaning trade deals with agricultural heavyweights like Canada and the Mercosur beef giants Brazil and Argentina are a hot-button topic.\n\nFor the first time, as many as nine of LREM's 304 MPs, including Jerretie, voted against CETA and 52 abstained. LREM lawmakers say that even though the party is generally pro-free trade, there is no blanket instruction to vote in favor of every trade agreement.\n\n\"The En Marche group was in favor of CETA but is not in favor of Mercosur, so I think it\u2019s on a case-by-case basis,\" said Jerretie.\n\nThe EU and Mercosur concluded talks on a landmark trade deal in June, after 20 years of negotiations. It was opposed by EU farmers who feared increased competition from South America, and by environmental groups who warned it was an incentive for Brazil to turn more of the Amazon into farmland. Macron turned against the deal in its current form in August, citing Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's failure to tackle Amazon forest fires and deliver on other environmental commitments \u2014 a row that degenerated into personal insults.\n\nSome in LREM are convinced that the campaign of intimidation is already having an effect on votes.\n\n\"Those who abstained are very uncomfortable,\" said Barbara Bessot Ballot, a first-time MP from Haute-Sa\u00f4ne in Burgundy, who ran a tea and coffee business with her husband before entering politics. \"I am convinced [they abstained] to avoid trouble.\"\n\n\"We are going through a political moment during which, when people disagree, the reaction is immediately quite violent,\" said Marie Lebec, who before becoming an MP and spokesperson for the LREM group in parliament used to be a lobbyist on European issues. She regularly receives abuse on social media, and even death threats, which \"makes me wonder about representative democracy, and the place of MPs.\"\n\nThe heated debate on the trade deals highlights the apparent lack of consensus among LREM lawmakers about whether it is their job to represent the interests of their specific constituency, or the nation as a whole. A 2014 law made it illegal to be elected to local and national bodies at the same time, leading to accusations that the French parliament is disconnected from everyday reality.\n\n\"We are not local elected officials,\" said Lebec. \"I represent the nation and I work on certain themes and by this logic, I go beyond my territory.\"\n\nHowever, for her colleague Jerretie, who is informed by his mayoral experience, this is less clear. \"The LREM group needs to evolve on what it really means to be an MP,\" he said. \"An MP is still an official who is elected [to represent] a territory ... You can't allow yourself to vote for something that will totally destroy a local economy.\"\n\nLike two-year-olds\n\nSophie Beaudouin-Hubi\u00e8re, a new MP who worked in HR before running for office, said the people behind the recent wave of abuse and threats belong to the current \"first generation of the 'child-king'\" who, when frustrated, \"express ourselves through violence as if we were still two years old.\"\n\nSurprisingly, perhaps, none of the first-time MPs who spoke to POLITICO appeared to be thinking of quitting politics, despite the burden on their families and the uncomfortable sensation of having become the \"bad guys\" overnight. Instead some are more introspective, and see ways LREM needs to improve.\n\nSome are questioning what elements of their own behavior could be improved. Beaudouin-Hubi\u00e8re said the LREM movement was \"very young\" and enthusiastic when it came to power and threw itself \"like mad\" into politics in a way that was \"very technical, very technocratic \u2014 without speaking to people.\"\n\nNevertheless, she maintains that while more time should be spent explaining Macron's reform agenda, she doesn't think MPs should change course in the face of disapproval \u2014 giving as an example the campaign promise by Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand to abolish the death penalty, which he fulfilled when he became president in 1981.\n\n\"We are not elected to be loved,\" she said. \"It\u2019s not show business, it\u2019s politics.\"", "description": "Lawmakers from La R\u00e9publique En Marche suffer physical and verbal abuse as they struggle to promote the party\u2019s liberal agenda.", "authors": ["Rym Momtaz", "David M.
