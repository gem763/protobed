So I'm going to end my presidential campaign.\"\n\nDe Blasio was one of three mayors running for the Democratic nomination. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Miramar, Florida, Mayor Wayne Messam remain in the race.\n\nDe Blasio's withdrawal from the race came after months of failing to improve what was persistently ultra-low support in opinion polls tracking voters' preferences for Democratic contenders vying for the nomination.\n\nRecent national polls show de Blasio receiving, at best, support from just 1% of the respondents. He failed to qualify for the third Democratic debate, which took place last week.\n\nA Siena College Research Institute poll in early September found that less than 1% of New York state voters supported his candidacy and 0% of voters in New York City did so.\n\nA month before he announced his run in May, with a message that President \"Donald Trump must be stopped,\" a majority of voters in New York City had a negative opinion about de Blasio's performance as mayor.\n\nAnd a large majority of city residents \u2014 76% \u2014 had said he should not run for president.\n\n\"The odds are clearly against me,\" de Blasio said earlier in September. \"But the odds have been against me in every election I've been in, and I've managed to prevail.\"\n\nTrump, meanwhile, reveled in de Blasio's announcement. In a Friday morning tweet, the president trolled the unpopular mayor of his hometown, saying he was \"polling at a solid ZERO but had tremendous room for growth.\"", "description": "\"I feel like I've contributed all I can to this primary election,\" he told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\" \"And it's clearly not my time.
