The Hairskeens that I use are durable but also invisible. They rarely ever shed and it's such a high quality system.\n\nThe whole process takes up to three hours and whilst invasive hair transplant surgery can cost upwards of $8600 (\u00a37,000), Phil charges $850 (\u00a3650) for the first hair-replacement service.
