Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told POLITICO in a statement Wednesday it is \"laughable\" to consider Trump's overtures to his Ukrainian counterpart \"an impeachable offense.\"\n\nPelosi \u201chas aligned herself with the radical left to appease them. She knows this is a bad move, she\u2019s only been saying that for the past year,\u201d said Kelly Sadler, a spokeswoman for the pro-Trump super PAC America First.\n\nImpeaching Trump has been met with apprehension among voters, including those who detest the president. A Quinnipiac University poll conducted in late July \u2014 after Mueller concluded his investigation into Russian election interference, but before it became public that Trump implored his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate 2020 Democratic hopeful Joe Biden \u2014 found that 60 percent of voters opposed congressional action on impeachment, even as a majority of respondents in the same poll said they believed Trump is racist.\n\n\u201cThis will turn off a lot of voters who \u2026 maybe they don\u2019t love the president, but also don\u2019t love Washington and politics in general. It makes what was already going to be a tough election for Democrats even tougher,\u201d said a former senior Trump administration official.\n\nTrump and his allies say they will continue to use public polling on the issue of impeachment as a cudgel against Democrats as long as it fits their narrative that voters care more about pocketbook issues than they do about whether Trump violated the norms of presidential behavior, or abused the powers of his office.\n\n\u201cThe logical thing for the average voter to say is, this has nothing to do with my life,\u201d said Larry Sabato, a political analyst and director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. Sabato suggested that Democrats proceed expeditiously by making Feb. 3, the day of the Iowa caucuses, their \u201cinformal deadline\u201d for an impeachment vote in the lower chamber.\n\n\u201cIf Democrats don\u2019t handle this well, they will end up doing the near impossible: creating sympathy for Donald Trump,\u201d he said.\n\nA person close to the Trump campaign went further, saying Democrats would be \"better off\u201d focusing on kitchen table issues like healthcare and income inequality between now and the general election, rather than barreling toward impeachment.\n\n\u201cHow can any Democrat run for office saying \u2018Hey, I want compromise. Hey, I\u2019ve been trying to get stuff done?\u2019 They can\u2019t say that now. Now their party is literally trying to impeach this guy, and so it takes that talking point away from them.\u201d\n\nTrump aides have already been hard at work trying to cast the president as a victim of partisan zeal. On Wednesday, the White House distributed talking points describing impeachment as \u201cjust another example of the \u2018Deep State,\u2019 the media, and Democrats damaging our national security for political gain.\u201d The document was accidentally sent to some House Democrats.\n\n\"Democrats launching impeachment over a fake scandal nobody cares about has to be one of the dumbest political moves of all time \u2014 so bad it should be reported as an in-kind contribution to the president's 2020 reelect,\" said former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders.\n\nThey\u2019ve also claimed the impeachment effort \u2014 which was prompted by a whistleblower complaint about Trump\u2019s overtures to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, among other actions Democrats have long considered egregious \u2014 has benefited the president in another way: by subjecting Biden to an onslaught of news coverage about his son\u2019s overseas business dealings when he was serving as vice president. Biden told reporters over the weekend he\u2019s \u201cnever\u201d spoken to his son, Hunter, about the matter.\n\nSome members of the president\u2019s inner circle believe the attention paid to the whistleblower complaint has made it look as though Democrats sacrificed Biden to boost Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s chances of becoming their party\u2019s nominee. Party officials and other primary candidates have publicly and privately expressed concern in recent months about the 76-year-old former vice president\u2019s age and propensity to misspeak in debates and on the campaign trail.\n\n\u201cElizabeth Warren has already killed Joe Biden in the presidential race,\u201d said a person close to Trump, referring to recent polls that have shown the progressive senator eclipsing Biden in the earliest two voting states, New Hampshire and Iowa. \u201cThis just makes it more difficult for him to come out of the grave.\u201d\n\nSome Republicans close to the president consider Biden to be the most fearsome Democratic candidate in a general election match-up, citing polls that have shown him trouncing Trump in both swing states and reliably red parts of the country.\n\nBut others close to Trump think it\u2019s far too early to predict winners and losers from the latest development surrounding impeachment, and they warn the optics of Trump\u2019s phone call with Zelensky can harm his campaign.\n\n\u201cThe problem with the call is it\u2019s muddy,\u201d said a former senior White House official, adding that Trump can do further damage by going \u201cnuts\u201d in the face of a looming House impeachment vote.\n\nAnother Republican strategist said \"playing the victim is off-brand for Trump, who exudes strength as a leader.\"\n\n\"The first time Trump sees himself portrayed as weak, he will go in another direction,\" this person said.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/5e/91/a7e481464cdaabeab50b0f0012a4/190925-trump-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
