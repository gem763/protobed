Jeff Overs/BBC/Handout via REUTERS\n\nNATIONAL INTEREST\n\nDavid Gauke, a former British justice secretary and a Johnson critic, said he would meet the prime minister on Monday to hear his plan to deliver a Brexit deal he could support.\n\nBut Gauke said he was prepared to disobey Conservative discipline and be expelled by the party if he was not persuaded.\n\n\u201cSometimes there is a point where you have to judge between your own personal interests and the national interest, and the national interest has to come first,\u201d he told Sky News. \u201cBut I hope it doesn\u2019t come to that.\u201d\n\nSky News reported later on Sunday, however, that Johnson cancelled the meeting with Gauke because of a \u2018diary clash\u201d.\n\nJohnson told the Sunday Times that those backing the opposition to no-deal risked there being no Brexit at all.\n\n\u201cAre you going to side with those who want to scrub the democratic verdict of the people \u2014 and plunge this country into chaos?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOr are you going to side with those of us who want to get on, deliver on the mandate of the people and focus with absolute, laser-like precision on the domestic agenda? That\u2019s the choice.\u201d\n\nJohnson has demanded the withdrawal agreement negotiated with the EU be changed to remove the Irish \u201cbackstop\u201d - an insurance policy designed to maintain an open border between EU member Ireland and the UK\u2019s Northern Ireland.\n\nGove said German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron had indicated after talks with Johnson that the agreement - \u201cwhich they had said was a block of marble that could not be altered\u201d - was now capable of being changed.\n\nBut the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said the backstop had to stay to protect the integrity of the EU single market.\n\n\u201cThe backstop is the maximum amount of flexibility that the EU can offer to a non-member state,\u201d he wrote in the Sunday Telegraph.\n\nLabour Party's Shadow Secretary of State for Brexit Keir Starmer speaks to the media as he leaves the BBC Headquarters after appearing on The Andrew Marr show in London, Britain, September 1, 2019.
