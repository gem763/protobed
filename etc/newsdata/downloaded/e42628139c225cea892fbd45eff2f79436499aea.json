The Vatican also remains without a finance chief more than two years after the last one, Cardinal George Pell, left to face sex-abuse charges in Australia.\n\nSt. Peter's Square at the Vatican on Sunday.

The cardinal called an extraordinary meeting of Vatican department chiefs for Sept. 20 to address the issue.\n\nSome Vatican officials have complained for years that the Holy See is lax about controlling spending and income.\n\nMoney at the Vatican Finances at the Holy See and Vatican City are ultimately the responsibility of the pope. Holy See spending (2018) \u20ac \u20ac300 million Holy See deficit (2018) \u20ac70 million \u20ac Holy See\u2019s financial assets \u20ac1.8 billion* Vatican City\u2019s financial assets* \u20ac500 million* = 10 employees Holy See employees 3,000* Vatican City employees 2,000*\n\nRedundant jobs, wasteful procurement and a costly car fleet push up costs, while real-estate holdings around Rome are sometimes not maintained and rents not collected, they say. The Vatican also took a heavy loss last year on a loan to a Catholic hospital.\n\nPope Francis\u2019 election in 2013 followed cases of alleged corruption, waste and incompetence at the Vatican, including the expenditure of \u20ac550,000 on a Christmas manger scene in St. Peter\u2019s Square. The pope established several new bodies to control finances early in his pontificate, and gave the now-disgraced Cardinal Pell authority over the Vatican\u2019s purse.\n\nCardinal Pell clashed with established interests at the Vatican and the pope curtailed his role. Last year the cardinal was found guilty of sexually abusing minors in Australia in the 1990s, a conviction upheld on appeal last month. The pope hasn\u2019t named a successor. Also vacant is the job of auditor general, whose first and last occupant resigned in 2017 and accused powerful officials of obstructing him.\n\nSome Vatican officials said they believe a management vacuum has contributed to poorly planned spending at the Holy See, which consists of the diocese of Rome headed by the pope and the central administration of the global Catholic Church.\n\nPersistent deficits could run down the Holy See\u2019s financial reserves, Vatican officials fear, eventually jeopardizing the pope\u2019s mission in costly areas such as diplomatic relations, the preservation of the Vatican\u2019s historic buildings and art treasures, and other commitments such as employee pensions.\n\n\u201cWhat the Holy Father is calling for is that we need an administration, that is the Holy See administration, to be self-sustainable,\u201d said Joseph Zahra, a Maltese businessman who is the top layman on the Council for the Economy, which supervises Vatican finances.\n\n\u201cWhat he is saying is this can\u2019t go on forever. One can see incremental changes but there have to be radical steps,\u201d Mr. Zahra said.\n\nThe Vatican plans to release financial figures this fall for the first time since 2015, he said.\n\nMr. Zahra said the Sept. 20 meeting will address short-term measures to reduce the deficit, such as centralizing IT operations and spacing out costly initiatives such as conferences, while considering ways to improve returns on the Holy See\u2019s financial assets, which total some \u20ac1.8 billion, and its considerable real-estate holdings in Rome.\n\nMr. Zahra described the meeting as part of an awareness campaign aimed at Vatican officials. \u201cMany of them don\u2019t realize the situation the Vatican is in. They think that money is no problem,\u201d he said.\n\nVatican officials say that about \u20ac30 million of last year\u2019s shortfall was from a one-time expense: the partial write-off of a loan given around four years ago to a Catholic hospital in Rome, the Istituto Dermopatico dell\u2019Immacolata, that was being reorganized following financial difficulties. Asked about the loan, a spokesman for the hospital, Andrea Barbieri, called this account baseless but declined to elaborate.\n\n\u201cWith better decisions, with better decision-making, we hope that we won\u2019t find ourselves in other situations\u201d requiring such heavy write-offs, Mr. Zahra said.\n\nAside from the IDI loan, the Holy See\u2019s 2018 deficit expanded by several million euros over the previous year, continuing a long-term trend as investment returns and other income have failed to match expenses.\n\nAbout 45% of the Holy See\u2019s budget of around \u20ac300 million is devoted to salaries for its roughly 3,000 employees. While the staff is small for the headquarters of a global church with 1.3 billion members, some Vatican officials privately complain that too many employees are in obsolete functions.\n\nMany offices employ multiple doormen and ushers whose jobs could be largely eliminated through the use of automated security systems, these officials say. On the other hand, secretarial and research staff are scarce, usually available only to senior officials.\n\nVatican officials say the pope, who has often inveighed against the \u201csocial ill\u201d of unemployment, won\u2019t countenance layoffs.\n\nThe focus now isn\u2019t on cutting payrolls but on improving employees\u2019 productivity, in some cases through retraining, Mr. Zahra said.\n\nThe Holy See regularly covers much of its annual deficit with a contribution of about \u20ac30 million from Vatican City State, the sovereign territory inside Italy ruled by the pope, which keeps separate accounts from the Holy See and regularly enjoys a surplus.\n\nThe city state\u2019s revenue comes notably from the Vatican Museums, which usually make at least \u20ac40 million in profit a year. Pope Francis\u2019 decision in 2017 to stop selling cigarettes in the city state\u2019s shops cut annual profits by several million euros.\n\nThe Vatican Bank, another separate entity, used to contribute at least \u20ac50 million a year to the Holy See, regardless of its performance. But since 2015 the bank now transfers only its profit, which was \u20ac17.5 million last year.\n\nThe forthcoming financial statements for 2018 will be the Vatican\u2019s first that completely follow international public sector accounting standards, Mr. Zahra said.\n\nWrite to Francis X.
