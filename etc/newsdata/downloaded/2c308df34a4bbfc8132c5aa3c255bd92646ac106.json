The arrests all came after County Executive Marc Elrich signed an executive order designating the county a \"sanctuary\" jurisdiction.\n\nSEVENTH ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT ACCUSED OF SEX CRIMES IN MARYLAND COUNTY SINCE JULY 25\n\nThe order states that no county agency \u2013 including police departments \u2013 can cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Immigration agents are barred from entering secure portions of county jails and must take custody of illegal immigrants in public areas, such as jail parking lots.\n\nBut amid national coverage of the sex crimes, the County Council responded by lumping critics such as Cuccinelli in with \u201cneo-Nazi sympathizers\" and people who spread \"false information.\"\n\nCUCCINELLI PUTS HARDLINE STAMP ON IMMIGRATION AGENDA, JUST 2 MONTHS INTO USCIS JOB\n\n\u201cThere has been a lot of naccurate information spread by the White House, President Trump, Acting USCIS Director Ken Cuccinelli, local and national conservative news outlets and neo-Nazi sympathizers regarding our criminal justice system and its process,\u201d a statement said. \u201cThese individuals and organizations should be ashamed for spreading false information seeking to establish a baseless, illogical and xenophobic connection between a person\u2019s failure to obtain legal status and their propensity to commit a sex crime.\u201d\n\nCuccinelli called the Nazi implications \u201cout of bounds in civil society\u201d and challenged Elrich to a debate \u2013 even going into detail about the precise terms of how such a debate would take place.\n\n\u201cIf MontCo Chairman Elrich thinks the sanctuary policy they are so proud of is so good, I challenge him to a debate on the subject. Neutral location (e.g. cspan [sic] or webcast w/no audience present). 1 hr total, 2.5 min open & close, w/alternating 5 min blocks determined by lot,\u201d he said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cNo moderator, only a timekeeper w/a hard stop (i.e., mic goes off at end of time). I\u2019ll defend children and crime victims, Elrich can defend rapists and murders who shouldn\u2019t even be in this country,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cWhat do you say, Mr. Chairman?\u201d\n\nThe Montgomery County Council did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News.\n\nFox News' Sam Dorman contributed to this report.", "description": "Acting U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Director Ken Cuccinelli on Friday challenged the executive of Montgomery County, Md. to a debate over \u201csanctuary city\u201d policies.", "authors": ["Adam Shaw"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_0146.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
