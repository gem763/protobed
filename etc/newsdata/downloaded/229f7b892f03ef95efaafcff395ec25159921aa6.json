Revenue climbed to $6.1 billion from $5.4 billion, matching the FactSet consensus of $6.1 billion.\n\nFor the fiscal year ahead, Visa V, +2.83% expects low double-digit revenue growth and a negative-1% to negative-1.5% impact from foreign currency. It also projects a roughly 0.5% positive impact from acquisitions. On earnings, the company is calling for mid-teens growth, a 1% to 1.5% negative foreign-currency impact, and a negative acquisition impact of about 1%. The company\u2019s outlook assumes stability in economic conditions.\n\nThe outlook served as \u201cthe real bright spot,\u201d wrote Baird analyst David Koning. Keefe, Bruyette, and Woods analyst Sanjay Sakhrani said that he \u201ccame away from the conference call feeling like the underlying volume growth remains intact and the set up for next year (and beyond) is positive.\u201d\n\nVisa spent time on its earnings call walking through the various inputs for its forecast, including an expected boost in client incentives, which Visa pays to partners to route more payment volume through its platform.\n\nThe company said it will have renewed a third of its volume during the three quarters spanning from the just-completed fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 to the second quarter of fiscal 2020, which Chief Financial Officer Vasant Prabhu called \u201can unprecedented level of renewal activity\u201d as the company saw some opportunities for early renewals with clients such as Chase in addition to its scheduled renewals. These renewals are driving the expected incentive growth and Visa projects that it will feel the full effects starting this quarter.\n\nIn terms of positive drivers for Visa\u2019s financials, the company expects to continue benefiting from pricing actions taken in fiscal 2019 as well as some new moves on pricing in 2020 that should be smaller in magnitude.\n\nVisa also highlighted some events that could help support revenue and volume growth, including the Tokyo Olympics in summer 2020. Japan is primarily a cash-driven country, but its government is using the Olympics as a way to drive payments digitization and is rolling out infrastructure to support these efforts. Visa is a longtime sponsor of the Olympics and will have a big presence once again at the games.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very exciting when a government decides to use the Olympics to move toward cashless,\u201d Prabhu told MarketWatch.\n\nPrabhu spoke as well about Visa\u2019s positioning in Europe more than three years after its deal for Visa Europe closed. He sees \u201clots of opportunity to grow\u201d in markets like Germany, Spain and Italy, as well as an overall chance to improve credit penetration in Europe, as debit is still prominent. \u201cThe acquisition has been nothing short of a home run for us,\u201d he said, pointing to accretion in the double digits.\n\nShares have gained 34% so far this year, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.11% has risen 15%.", "description": "Visa Inc. shares gained in after-hours trading Thursday after the company beat profit expectations and delivered a forecast that one analyst said showed...", "authors": ["Emily Bary"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GJ095_Visa_2_ZG_20180511153012.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
