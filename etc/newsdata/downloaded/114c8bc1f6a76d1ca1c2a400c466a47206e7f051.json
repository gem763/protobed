And that\u2019s the thing that\u2019s keeping a lot of people on edge: we know it could be bad. But how bad is it?\u201d\n\nCanada has fairly well-established protocols for dealing with intelligence breaches, said Jessica Davis, a former intelligence analyst for the Canadian government and head of Insight Threat Intelligence.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of pretty intense breaches, particularly with the WikiLeaks, Edward Snowden and with Chelsea Manning,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that our allies are probably asking themselves, first of all, what information has been accessed and what steps are currently being taken to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d\n\nBut the arrest has shocked security experts and rattled the broader federal government bureaucracy.\n\nAmong the main causes for concern is the potential exposure of sensitive secrets such as spycraft developed by Canada\u2019s intelligence agency.\n\n\u201cGovernments will lose court cases to protect their sources and methods. That\u2019s how important this is. They would rather let a court case collapse than make that information public,\u201d said Carvin.\n\nOrtis faces five charges under Canada\u2019s Security of Information Act, as well as the two under Criminal Code, all in relation to alleged incidents that occurred between 2015 and 2019.\n\nThe charges show that Ortis is accused of communicating covert operational information in 2015. He also faces charges of sharing secret information with a terrorist group or foreign entity \u2013 but it remains unclear if he had interacted with a state or individual.\n\nCharges under the Security of Information Act \u2013 meant to prevent those who have access to classified information from leaking it \u2013 are extremely rare in Canada. If convicted, Ortis could face 14 years in federal prison.\n\nCanadian media outlets have speculated that Ortis could have been communicating with Russian or Chinese state actors, or organized crime rings. But because so little is known about the scope and content of the information he is accused of accessing, both Carvin and Davis urged caution.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very early to try to out whoever you think might have been involved,\u201d said Davis, calling speculation over Ortis past experiences or academic interests \u201cvery tenuous\u201d.\n\nOrtis appeared in an Ottawa court on Friday, but his case was adjourned until September 20th, in order for him to obtain legal counsel.", "description": "Police say charges of stealing covert information against Cameron Ortis pose \u2018potential risk\u2019 for US, UK, New Zealand and AustraliaA Royal Canadian Mounted Police commissioner acknowledged that Ortis had access to intelligence from both domestic and international allies.
