I'm extremely proud to see one of my players go and make his debut for England.\n\n'He was organising people around him, looked very good and calm on the ball, it was the sort of performance we've seen quite regularly.\n\n'He probably didn't get tested an awful lot defensively and played his part in a really good result for England.'\n\nIn the aftermath of what happened in the Bulgarian capital on Monday night, there was some speculation as to whether England could have walked off the field in protest.\n\nSmith, though, said: 'In my opinion, I didn't think it was the right thing to walk off but if one player thinks it's right to walk off then I think you all have to stay together.\n\n'If they all walk off that pitch then Tyrone loses his debut and the people who have scored lose their goals and then who's the winner in all of that? We do obviously believe that there's got to be a stance made.\n\nMings has excelled for Aston Villa this season and made an assured debut for England\n\n'Tyrone made it known to the official that he was being abused. I think the next step forward is the people who are getting abused, it shouldn't be them who are making it known.\n\n'It should be people around who aren't getting abused who make it known to the authorities or even delegates who are there, they are the ones who step forward. For me, that's a step in the right direction of dealing with this.'\n\nSmith confirmed Mings is raring to go on his return to club action as Villa welcome Brighton in the Premier League on Saturday afternoon, with midfielder Jota the only absentee after undergoing a hernia operation last Friday.\n\nAs for whether Mings could establish himself as a regular for England, Smith added: 'That decision is down to (manager) Gareth Southgate.\n\n'All I can say is that I don't see many left-footed defenders who are as good as Tyrone at the moment and obviously Gareth saw it that way as well for the game.'", "description": "Dean Smith believes it was entirely in keeping with Tyrone Mings' character that the Aston Villa defender spoke up to officials after being the subject of racial abuse on England duty.", "authors": ["Press Association Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/22/19859502-0-image-a-38_1571349004004.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
