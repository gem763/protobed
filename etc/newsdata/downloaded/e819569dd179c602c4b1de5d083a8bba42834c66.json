I used to really like fighting games but kind of lost interest on the current consoles and never really got into any of them. I might have got Super Smash Bros. Ultimate but I don\u2019t have a Switch, so that supposed best one doesn\u2019t really count for me.\n\nI\u2019m also not a big fan of Mortal Kombat, which always seems a bit try-hard teenager for my liking. ARMS is out because it\u2019s Switch only, I have no idea what Dragon Ball is, and all I hear is complaining about Street Fighter V. Soulcalibur VI looks more like a low budget remake than a sequel and that leaves\u2026 Tekken 7 I guess? It\u2019s hard to get excited about the seventh game in the series when the last four at least already all seem to blur into one.\n\nAnyone able to offer any further advice? Was there anything missed out in the list or am I being unfair in dismissing some of these? It seems to me that outside the Nintendo game the whole genre is stuck in a bit of a rut and I\u2019m not really sure what Street Fighter VI or Tekken 8 is ever really going to do to change things.\n\nTension\n\nGC: Not counting Smash Bros. our favourite is Samurai Shodown, which we don\u2019t think was mentioned in the Reader\u2019s Feature series.", "description": "The Tuesday Inbox looks forward to The Outer Worlds reviews, as one reader struggles to get excited about Diablo 4 and Overwatch 2.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/apps.55132.14105655085777342.6b1c6da5-0e26-4d56-a3cb-cf9eed3f50d6-fb3c_1571703818.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
