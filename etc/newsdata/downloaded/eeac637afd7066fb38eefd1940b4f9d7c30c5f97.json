As the American tariffs come in response to European subsidies to the aircraft maker Airbus, Brussels doesn't have immediate grounds to hit back.\n\nTo make matters worse, the self-styled \"Tariff Man\" is threatening a killer one-two punch against Brussels. In addition to Airbus tariffs, probably on up to \u20ac8 billion of goods, Trump is also looking to impose hefty duties on European auto exports that could come as early as mid-November.\n\n\"The global trade climate is not good. We have no more natural allies\" \u2014 Bernd Lange, Parliament trade committee chairman\n\nOfficials in Brussels have been watching with horror how Trump used the threat of those same auto tariffs to strong-arm Japan into making concessions on agriculture. The EU fears that a U.S.-Japan trade deal, which is supposed to be signed at next week's U.N. General Assembly in New York, will reinforce the president's belief that he can proceed with his gun-to-the-head tactics to extract similar concessions from the Europeans.\n\nOn top of these concerns, China has snubbed the EU by not sending a top official to a trade meeting scheduled for next week as Beijing appears to prioritize reaching an \"interim trade deal\" with the U.S. instead of making concessions on long-standing EU demands for market openings.\n\n\"The global trade climate is not good. We have no more natural allies,\" said Bernd Lange, chair of the European Parliament's trade committee.\n\nThe looming trade escalation also sets the stage for von der Leyen's pick as trade chief, Phil Hogan, who has a reputation as more of a brawler than his predecessor Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m. The 1.95-meter tall Irishman told RTE radio last week he would do everything he could \u201cto get Mr. Trump to see the error of his ways\u201d on trade.\n\nFrom whiskey to wings\n\nThe WTO ruling on Airbus represents the most urgent challenge.\n\nAmerica's tariff hit list published in April and extended in July covers about $22.7 billion worth of iconic European products \u2014 from whiskeys and Dutch Gouda cheese to luxury goods such as handbags \u2014 that the U.S. can tax at different rates to claw back damages of probably up to \u20ac8 billion. Washington can impose the tariffs as soon as the ruling has been made public, which is expected to happen in two weeks.\n\nMalmstr\u00f6m told reporters on Monday that Brussels had pulled out all the stops to avoid a tariff escalation from happening, but said that the Americans \"have not engaged\" in offers to reach a negotiated settlement.\n\n\"We have made concrete proposals but received no reaction. Zero,\" said trade committee chair Lange.\n\nGordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the EU, said that Washington is seeking \"an end to subsidies for Airbus and the recovery of damages. However, if negotiations between the U.S. and EU don\u2019t elicit a change in this behavior and a recovery of those damages, then the United States will suspend concessions and resort to tariffs.\"\n\nTiziana Beghin, a member of the European Parliament from the Italian 5Star Movement, said the threatened tariffs are a wakeup call for the incoming Commission to develop more robust defense mechanisms in the trade sector.\n\n\"The policy of muscle and retaliation is damaging to everyone and does not suit anyone,\" she said. \"The European Union needs more effective trade defense instruments as soon as possible to enable it to impose sanctions on third countries if unjustified tariffs are applied to European products.\"\n\nBesides that self-inflicted wound, the EU expects to have a chance to impose counter-duties against the U.S. in about half a year.\n\nReferring to the various Italian products that are targeted by the U.S. \u2014 such as pasta, Parmesan cheese, roasted coffee and olives \u2014 Beghin said that the WTO ruling is \"worrying and clearly damages 'Made in Italy.'\"\n\nOther targeted food producers have also expressed concern. \"Every barrier that a country introduces is of course troublesome. We are in favor of free trade,\" said Ren\u00e9 van Buitenen, spokesperson for the Dutch Dairy Association (NZO). He added that about 2 percent of all Dutch cheese and other dairy products go to the U.S. \"If these tariffs were to be introduced, we would need to see whether American producers are willing to pay more or where we can find alternative export markets.\"\n\nFrench wine exporters, who have already been threatened with U.S. tariffs in a parallel trade dispute over France's digital services tax, called for a negotiated outcome as nearly 20 percent of their global sales \u2014 worth over \u20ac1.6 billion last year \u2014 go to the United States and risk being affected by the duties, according to the Federation of French Wine and Spirits Exporters.\n\nTit for tat\n\nBesides the long list of prominent European food products in Trump's sights, the U.S. tariff list also covers airplane parts. This has sparked a warning from Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury, who told POLITICO that imposing such tariffs would backfire and negatively affect American jobs because of Airbus production in the U.S.\n\nBesides that self-inflicted wound, the EU expects to have a chance to impose counter-duties against the U.S. in about half a year.\n\nThat's because Brussels has its own WTO dispute running against American airplane producer Boeing, which was found to have benefited from unlawful subsidies too. By spring 2020, the WTO is expected to issue a ruling that will allow the EU to also claim damages from the U.S., and Brussels has already drafted a target list covering up to $20 billion worth of American products.\n\nThe European Parliament's Lange called the U.S. attitude \"regrettable\" because it forces the EU to resort to tariffs as well. \"It would be much better to forego such an escalation and agree on global rules for airplane subsidies, because there are other players such as China, Russia and Brazil that are pushing in this market and we need to create fair rules that apply to all sides,\" he said.\n\nThe U.S. National Association of Beverage Importers already issued a warning to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer that such a tit-for-tat escalation could be destructive.\n\n\"Up to 78,600 jobs in the U.S. beverage alcohol and hospitality sectors could be lost if distilled spirits, wine and non-alcoholic beer are included on the final U.S. list of European Union products targeted for retaliatory tariffs,\" the association told Lighthizer's office last month.\n\n\u201cIf beverage alcohol products remain on the final U.S. list, the EU would certainly respond by keeping U.S. beverage alcohol products on its list,\u201d the association said. \"The EU has threatened to impose tariffs on imports of U.S. wine, vodka, and rum,\" it added.\n\nThis article is from POLITICO Pro: POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service.
