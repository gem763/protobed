To Antoinette I offer my admiration for her principles and courage.\n\n\"No 10 campaign must moderate its langauge (sic) & tone to MPs or we will see more of this.\"", "description": "She said the message was in her inbox the morning after losing a vote of confidence from her local Tory group", "authors": ["Mikey Smith", "Image", "Afp Getty Images", "Western Mail"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20608256.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_BRITAIN-POLITICS-EU-BREXIT.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
