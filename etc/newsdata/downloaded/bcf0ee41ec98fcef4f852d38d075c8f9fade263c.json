Here's why one market expert says that means another recession is \u2018imminent.\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "A trend buried in a recent report on US gross domestic product is flashing warning signs of an economic recession, according to Societe Generale's Albert Edwards.\n\nIn late July, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released its annual revisions to the pace of economic growth, as well as updates to its previous estimates of corporate profits. Edwards, the co-head of global strategy at SocGen, admitted in a recent client note that these revisions \"are usually met with a loud yawn from investors.\"\n\nHowever, the report contained a trend that should warrant everyone's full attention because, in Edwards' view, it suggests a recession is \"imminent.\"\n\nBefore this report was released, we knew that corporate profit margins were getting squeezed by the pressure on companies to raise wages and change their longstanding prioritization of shareholders over workers.\n\nBut the report, which contained so-called national income and personal accounts (NIPA) data, showed that corporate profits for both Main Street and Wall Street peaked as far back as late-2014, not late last year as previous numbers had shown.\n\n\"In stark contrast to booming stock market measures of profits, the BEA's NIPA have essentially flatlined for the last few years,\" Edwards said.\n\n\"This divergence is quite normal just before a recession with the NIPA profits data proving, in retrospect, to be a truer representation of the underlying trend.\"\n\nRead more: Top Wall Street investors say they're struggling to find big, bullish stock-market bets to make \u2014 and their paralysis might signal a meltdown is looming\n\nEdwards' note included a throwback to 2008, when stock market-based measures of profits appeared much healthier than economy-wide gauges like those contained in the NIPA data.\n\nSociete Generale\n\nEdwards finds the NIPA numbers on profits to be more trustworthy because they are based on tax data collected by the IRS. This means NIPA includes private companies for a more complete barometer of corporate America, and sidesteps the accounting hacks that publicly traded firms deploy to boost their adjusted earnings per share.\n\nThe slump in economy-wide profit growth is problematic because it might imply that a corresponding decline in business investment is coming, according to Edwards.\n\nIt all ties back to consumers\n\nTo be sure, consumer spending remains the economy's most powerful driver and has kept it afloat during this expansion when business spending dwindled.\n\nEdwards doesn't dispute this fact. But he views the contribution that business investment makes to economic growth as an indicator that should not be ignored.\n\nDespite that contribution being relatively small, economic recessions are always \"accounted for\" by a slump in business investment, he said.\n\nSociete Generale\n\nThere's also a circular dynamic at play that involves businesses and consumers. If profits dry up and businesses can't invest in new workers, the next step could be layoffs, which then crimps how much consumers can spend on businesses they patronize.\n\nThose businesses are not only of the publicly traded variety, which is why investors cannot afford to only use quarterly earnings releases to judge how profitable corporate America is.\n\nAccording to Edwards, the broadest earnings metric is flashing red not only for the stock market, but for the entire economy.", "description": "Profits from both Wall Street and Main Street are flashing a dire recessionary warning that also appeared in 2008, says SocGen's Albert Edwards.", "authors": ["Akin Oyedele"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5c23aca72ab31e16bf74b60b-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
