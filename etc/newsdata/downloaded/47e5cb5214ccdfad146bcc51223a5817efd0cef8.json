Got a question for her? Email askaboss@nymag.com. Photo-Illustration: The Cut\n\nDear Boss,\n\nI know there\u2019s no point in taking it personally when you\u2019re rejected for a job. When I do get rejected, I can usually come up with a reason why I wasn\u2019t a good fit, even if I\u2019d been excited about it previously. For example, one time I realized that the interviewer sounded like they really wanted someone with a particular skill that I don\u2019t have. Another time I was pretty sure they had an internal candidate on the team who they wanted to promote.\n\nBut I\u2019m not sure how to deal with rejection when I genuinely thought the job would be an amazing fit for me, and yet I didn\u2019t get an offer. This has happened a few times lately. In one case, I was a perfect match for the qualifications listed in the ad and the interviewer seemed enthusiastic about working together \u2026 and then I didn\u2019t even make it to the final round of interviews.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing when I can see the reason I might have been rejected, but if an employer decides I\u2019m not \u201cgood enough\u201d for a job that matches me perfectly, how will I ever get hired anywhere?\n\nYou\u2019re falling into the very common trap of trying to read too much meaning into the results of your job applications. Hiring processes tend to be frustratingly opaque to candidates, and when you combine that with how high the stakes feel if you\u2019re really interested in the job, it\u2019s natural to try to read into whatever the outcome is \u2014 and to draw conclusions about yourself along the way.\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re thinking of getting hired as pass/fail: If you\u2019re good enough, you\u2019ll get the job. And if you don\u2019t get the job, you\u2019re not good enough \u2026 and possibly a horrible failure in general.\n\nBut that\u2019s not how hiring works. You could be someone who the hiring manager would be delighted to hire, but another candidate just ended up being stronger. That doesn\u2019t mean you suck \u2014 in fact, if that person hadn\u2019t been in the applicant pool, the job might have gone to you. (That\u2019s frustrating in a different way, of course \u2014 but it\u2019s not a referendum on you in the way you\u2019re currently thinking.)\n\nFrankly, it\u2019s impossible to know from the outside what\u2019s going on behind the scenes in a hiring process.\n\nFor one thing, hiring isn\u2019t always as strictly merit-based as you might think it is. There are the obvious exceptions, like jobs that go to the CEO\u2019s cousin\u2019s kid or to an internal candidate who has to be promoted for political reasons. But there are other ways that plays out, too \u2014 like when the candidate who\u2019s strongest on paper gets passed over for a slightly less strong candidate who will get along better with a difficult stakeholder or demanding boss. There\u2019s also the much maligned \u201cculture fit,\u201d which can indeed be problematic (like when it ends up screening out people of different ages or races), but which can sometimes be legitimate (like, \u201cwe\u2019re really entrepreneurial here and you seem to prefer a lot of structure and hierarchy\u201d).\n\nBut even beyond that, there are lots of other reasons why qualified candidates get rejected. Most importantly, like I mentioned at the start, no matter how qualified you are, someone else can always be more qualified. Or someone else might be equally qualified \u2014 but if there\u2019s only one position to fill, only one of you is getting hired. I\u2019ve had times when I happily would have hired two or three or even more of the candidates I interviewed for a role, but I could only hire one of them \u2014 which means that really good people were getting rejected.\n\nIt\u2019s also always possible that an employer is looking for a qualification that you didn\u2019t know about \u2014 sometimes because they didn\u2019t realize they wanted it until they saw it in someone else (like fluency in a foreign language, for example, or an impressive slate of fundraising contacts).\n\nMoreover, things can change during a hiring process. Maybe you perfectly matched the qualifications they advertised for, but since then they\u2019ve learned their Excel expert is leaving and now they\u2019re looking for someone who can fill that gap, too. Other things can change as well, like budgets (which can change the level they\u2019re hiring for), managers (a new manager might have different ideas about the role), and projects (new or canceled projects can change what\u2019s prioritized in a new hire).\n\nAnd the interview itself can reveal ways in which you\u2019re not quite the right match, despite your qualifications. Maybe you\u2019re soft-spoken and they\u2019re looking for someone more assertive. Maybe you have great experience organizing high-profile, big budget events, but they need someone who can work with smaller budgets. Sometimes this type of rejection is even in your best interest! For example, if you talked in the interview about wanting a lot of independence and autonomy and the manager for the role is a notorious micromanager, it\u2019s smart for them screen you out \u2014 and that would be a bullet dodged for you.\n\nSometimes, too, it just comes down to personal style. Sometimes one personality type just fits better into a team or with a manager than another one does. That could be you in one hiring process, and someone else in a different one. And it\u2019s very hard to know from the outside when that\u2019s a strong factor in how an employer is evaluating candidates.\n\nOr, of course, maybe it is about your qualifications. Maybe you\u2019re applying for jobs that you\u2019re not qualified enough for. But if you\u2019re getting interviews \u2014 and it sounds like you are \u2014 it\u2019s far more likely that your qualifications are just fine. Although it\u2019s also worth checking in on your interview skills and making sure those aren\u2019t doing you any disservice. For example, be sure that you\u2019re practicing answers to the most common interview questions, and mining your experience for compelling examples of times when you\u2019ve demonstrated the skills the job requires.\n\nBut sometimes rejections are really just about math. Since employers get more qualified candidates than they can hire, very often rejection isn\u2019t a measure of your worth at all.\n\nGet Ask a Boss delivered every week Email Terms & Privacy Notice By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us.\n\nOrder Alison Green\u2019s book Ask a Manager: Clueless Colleagues, Lunch-Stealing Bosses, and the Rest of Your Life at Work here.
