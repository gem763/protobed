But the firm saw profits fall 8% from the comparable quarter a year earlier to $1.12 billion.\n\nBlackRock reported earnings of $7.15 a share, down from $7.54 a share a year earlier for its third quarter. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting $6.92 a share.\n\nTotal net flows, which is the difference between investor money going into BlackRock and money leaving, rose to $84.25 billion, up from a loss of $3.11 billion a year earlier. The company's assets under management topped $6.96 trillion for the period.\n\nRevenue grew about 3% to $3.69 billion, in line with what analysts had expected.\n\nThe world's biggest money manager helped steer a revolution in financial markets with exchange-traded funds that trade rapidly and index funds that track markets cheaply.\n\nTechnology-services revenue rose 30%, but still makes up a small part of the company's revenue. BlackRock provides software for financial institutions to monitor risk. The firm has been trying to expand that business, in a bid to expand its reach across markets and smooth the effect of market swings.\n\nWrite to Patrick Thomas at Patrick.Thomas@wsj.com", "description": "Investors increased the flood of cash flowing into money-management giant BlackRock Inc. in the last quarter.
