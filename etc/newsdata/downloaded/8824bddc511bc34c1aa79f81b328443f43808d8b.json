But have we hit peak gimmick?", "language": "en", "text": "Rejoice! Or despair! Coldplay have a new album coming.\n\nChris Martin et al didn\u2019t announce their eighth record, Everyday Life, through a traditional press release. Instead, they took out ads in local papers around the world, listing the tracks for their double album (yep, double) alongside notices for fridge freezers and hay bales. And through this calculated display of humility, they made far more headlines than a bog standard PR email would have done.\n\nThis kind of stunt is increasingly frequent at a time when every artist, especially if they\u2019re a big star, is trying to be more \u201csurprising\u201d than the next. I blame Beyonce \u2013 ever since the unannounced arrival of her brilliant self-titled album in 2013, gimmicky releases have become the norm, and surprises have become less and less surprising.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIt\u2019s becoming a rare event, in fact, for an email to drop into my inbox with a subject line like, \u201cPaul McCartney announces his 4,513th solo album, out next spring\u201d. Because bands don\u2019t need to rely on journalists to spread the word anymore. It\u2019s much more fun to have your fans do the detective work.\n\nAnd it does often take a detective to figure out when, say, Kanye West, is going to drop an album. A few weeks ago, the world was poised for the teased release of Jesus is King. West hadn\u2019t officially announced a release date, so fans and music journalists alike had been forced to pick up on his misleading, scatterbrained clues. My colleague even stayed up until midnight, primed to review it as soon as it dropped. It didn\u2019t. Just last night, she did the same. Again, it didn\u2019t appear. Has West never heard of the boy who cried wolf?\n\nPerhaps artists are resorting to untraditional rollouts because there is so much noise to compete with these days. A recent Vulture article pointed out that there was seven times more music released this year than in 1960. It might just not cut it anymore to release a press release, do the interview rounds, and release a handful of singles, months ahead of time. Because by the time your album\u2019s out, the world might have moved on. Our attention spans aren\u2019t what they were. I\u2019m surprised you\u2019re still reading this.\n\nI don\u2019t exactly know the reason for artists\u2019 newfound allergy to announcing their albums normally. But if it means one fewer email in my inbox with the word \u201csongstress\u201d in it, then I won\u2019t complain.\n\nYours,\n\nAlexandra Pollard\n\nArts writer and commissioning editor", "description": "Rejoice!
