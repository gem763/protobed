They were also given an album of photos of Diana during her visit.\n\nWilliam highlighted the visit to the glacier and the challenge of climate change, a major theme of their five-day trip, in a speech the previous evening at a reception hosted by the British High Commission at Pakistan\u2019s national monument in the capital, Islamabad.\n\nPakistan\u2019s northern glaciers and those throughout the Hindu Kush and Himalaya region, are an important water store for 250 million people, and another 1.6 billion rely on rivers originating in the mountains, putting many communities at risk as global temperatures rise.\n\n\u201cThis could lead to a loss of over a third of these vital glaciers in less than a century, with enormous impacts not only on the availability of water, but on agriculture and hydropower generation,\u201d William said in his speech.\n\nHe said he hoped Wednesday\u2019s visit to Chitral would help the couple better understand the challenges residents were facing first hand. \u201cI hope to learn what more we all can do to help prevent and mitigate this impending global catastrophe.\u201d\n\nKate and William later observed damage and emergency response drills in a village in Chitral that had been hit by floods due to glaciers melting.\n\nThey also vistaed a settlement of the Kalash people, a small indigenous group living in the Chitral region where they met with young people and wore colourful local scarves and headwear while being treated to song and dance.", "description": "Britain's Prince William and his wife Kate on Wednesday visited a melting glacier in the Hindu Kush mountain range not far from Pakistan's border with Afghanistan, witnessing first hand the impact of climate change their trip is seeking to highlight.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441483127&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F14N", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
