Kumgang a Pipe Dream for Now", "language": "en", "text": "Hyundai Group chairwoman Hyun Jeong-eun admitted on Monday that the resumption of package tours to North Korea's Mt. Kumgang is unlikely any time soon.\n\nHyun had just returned from a two-day-trip to the mountain resort, which was opened up for tourism by her late husband while subsidiary Hyundai Asan ran the tours. Over 100 South Koreans joined Hyun there to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the tours.\n\nIn August, Hyun for some reason expressed hope that tours would resume before the year is up, despite international sanctions making that impossible, but stalled negotiations between Pyongyang and Washington make that an even more distant prospect.", "description": "Hyundai Admits Tours to Mt.
