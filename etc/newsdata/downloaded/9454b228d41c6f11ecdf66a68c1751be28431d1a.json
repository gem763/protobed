NEVER. Full stop,\u201d he tweeted shortly after Trump\u2019s announcement, also via Twitter, on Saturday night.\n\nAdam Kinzinger (@RepKinzinger) Never should leaders of a terrorist organization that hasn\u2019t renounced 9/11 and continues in evil be allowed in our great country. NEVER. Full stop. https://t.co/pagnRFuFtc\n\nTrump revealed that separate meetings with the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, and Taliban leaders had been set to take place at Camp David this weekend.\n\nHe tweeted on Saturday: \u201cUnbeknownst to almost everyone, the major Taliban leaders and, separately, the President of Afghanistan, were going to secretly meet with me at Camp David on Sunday. They were coming to the United States tonight,\u201d Trump wrote.\n\nHe continued: \u201cUnfortunately, in order to build false leverage, they admitted to....an attack in Kabul that killed one of our great great soldiers, and 11 other people. I immediately cancelled the meeting and called off peace negotiations.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, Liz Cheney, a Republican congresswoman representing Wyoming, criticized the summit while supporting its cancellation.\n\n\u201cCamp David is where America\u2019s leaders met to plan our response after al Qaeda, supported by the Taliban, killed 3000 Americans on 9/11. No member of the Taliban should set foot there. Ever,\u201d she tweeted on Sunday morning. \u201cThe Taliban still harbors al Qaeda. The President is right to end the talks.\u201d\n\nBut the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, who defended the summit on several morning news programs, attempted to deflected congressional criticism.\n\n\u201cI, you know, I, I served with Congressman Kinzinger. I know him well. I value him. I know Congresswoman Cheney as well. And I appreciate their points,\u201d Pompeo said on ABC\u2019s This Week With George Stephanopoulos on Sunday.\n\n\u201cIn the end, if you\u2019re going to negotiate peace, you often have to deal with some pretty bad actors. And I know the history, too, at Camp David, indeed.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump reflected on that. We all considered it as we were debating how to try and get to the right, ultimate outcome. While there have often been discussions about war at Camp David, there have been discussions about peace there as well,\u201d Pompeo added.\n\nTrump under fire over revelation of cancelled US-Taliban peace talks Read more\n\nMeanwhile, Klobuchar declared herself unimpressed but also baffled.\n\n\u201cLike so many leaders, I spent last night trying to figure out the meaning of the president\u2019s tweet,\u201d Klobuchar told CNN\u2019s State of the Union TV show host Jake Tapper on Sunday.\n\n\u201cYes, we should be negotiating with the Afghan government and we should be negotiating with the Taliban to try to end the bloodshed in this country that has been going on for decades. The whole focus of this, of course, is to bring our troops home, which I strongly support,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBut this time, you see again that he has some kind of hastily arranged summit, which no one knew was happening. So, the whole thing doesn\u2019t quite make sense to me. And it\u2019s just another example of the president treating foreign policy like it\u2019s some kind of gameshow,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cThis isn\u2019t a gameshow. These are terrorists.\u201d\n\nTapper asked Klobuchar whether she would ask the Taliban to Camp David if she were president.\n\n\u201cIf you had an ironclad agreement, you could look at anything. To me, that didn\u2019t seem like the right venue to have this agreement made. That was my first reaction,\u201d she said.\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro, another 2020 Democratic candidate, was also critical, telling Tapper: \u201cIt\u2019s another bizarre episode.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more of his erratic behavior that people are tired of and that\u2019s one of the reasons I believe that he\u2019s going to lose in 2020,\u201d said Castro, \u201cit\u2019s very odd to invite a terrorist organization like that to Camp David \u2026 not in keeping with the way the United States negotiates.\u201d", "description": "Amy Klobuchar says: \u2018This isn\u2019t a gameshow.
