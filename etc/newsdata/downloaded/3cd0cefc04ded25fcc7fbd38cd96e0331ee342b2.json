(Peter and Maria Hoey/for The Washington Post)\n\nWhether your historic home is new to you or has been in the family for generations, an essential element of taking care of the property is adequate insurance.\n\n\u201cInsuring a historic home can be very different from insuring a newer home,\u201d says Dawn Meadows, an insurance adviser with Clarke & Sampson in Alexandria, Va. \u201cThe main consideration is that it can cost as much as 50 percent more to rebuild a historic home compared to a home of similar size constructed with modern materials.\u201d\n\nMost owners of historic homes view themselves as \u201cstewards of history,\u201d and it is important to them that their insurance allows them to repair any damage with historically accurate or at least similar materials, says Kate MacDougall, a historic home specialist and senior risk consultant with Chubb Personal Risk Services in Phoenix, Md.\n\nNot every insurance provider is willing to risk insuring a historic home, says Kevin Sullivan, a client executive with National Trust Insurance Services, a subsidiary of the National Trust for Historic Preservation in Baltimore.\n\n\u201cIf you ask 10 insurance carriers, \u2018Who wants to insure a Victorian home built in 1910?\u2019 maybe two would say okay,\u201d Sullivan says. \u201cBut one would charge a lot because it\u2019s historic, and one would charge less because that company would recognize that the home is built with superior quality that has stood the test of time.\u201d\n\nPremiums for insuring a historic home are typically about 20 percent higher than premiums for a standard home, says Shannon O\u2019Hare, a client manager with National Trust Insurance Services in Baltimore.\n\nThe reasons historic homes cost more to insure come down to two main issues: materials and building codes. Historic homes often were constructed with materials that aren\u2019t commonly used today. Insurers have to factor in the expense of replicating those features of the house if there\u2019s a flood or fire.\n\n\u201cReplacing plaster walls costs more than replacing drywall,\u201d Meadows says. \u201cThe type of lumber and moldings in historic homes is usually more expensive. It costs more to replace solid brass fixtures than brass-plate fixtures and to replace doors with solid-wood rather than hollow doors.\u201d\n\nBecause building codes change frequently, chances are a historic home won\u2019t be up to today\u2019s standards.\n\n\u201cSome features can be grandfathered in and won\u2019t need to be brought up to code, but others may have to be upgraded,\u201d Meadows says, such as widening a staircase or changing the handrails.\n\nUnique features in a historic home sometimes require a separate insurance policy, MacDougall says.\n\n\u201cFor example, if the home has unique stained-glass windows by Tiffany or an antique chandelier or a marble mantelpiece designed by an artist, you may need to add coverage as you would for fine art,\u201d she says. \u201cA separate rider on your policy for these unique features provides special coverage for breakage or repair of those items as well as replacement costs.\u201d\n\nDesignating a house as historic won\u2019t necessarily increase home insurance premiums, but it could have an impact.\n\n\u201cSometimes designations include specific requirements, such as that all windows must be replaced with wood windows that replicate the style of the original windows,\u201d Meadows says.\n\nThose specifications could raise the cost of repairing or replacing a home, which will be factored into the premiums.\n\nInsurance companies unfamiliar with older properties may also prefer to avoid homes with a historic designation.\n\n\u201cSome of our customers come to us when their insurance has been canceled by their insurance company because they found out that the property is designated as part of a historic district or on a local, state or national list of historic properties,\u201d Sullivan says.\n\nAn insurance inspection can provide helpful information to homeowners, Meadows says. An insurance inspection focuses on the materials and condition of the house to estimate future repair and replacement costs. It is different from a home inspection, which evaluates the property\u2019s condition for the buyer.\n\n\u201cDepending on the age and value of the house, an interior and exterior inspection may be done with an infrared camera to look for leaks, sagging floors, missing shingles or anything that can reveal the condition of the property,\u201d Meadows says.\n\nDistressed historic properties are especially challenging to insure.\n\n\u201cIf the historic property has not been renovated and isn\u2019t in livable condition, you may need to find a special insurance company or perhaps buy a builder\u2019s risk policy during renovations,\u201d Meadows says.\n\nKnob-and-tube wiring, an installation method for electricity used in the 19th and early 20th centuries, is the No. 1 reason some companies refuse to insure a historic home, Sullivan says.\n\n\u201cIf 75 percent of a house is knob-and-tube wiring, then the homeowners may need to replace it before the house can be insured,\u201d MacDougall says. \u201cSometimes, though, a contractor can explain that the knob-and-tube wiring only supports a couple of lights rather than the entire kitchen. In that case, an insurance company may be willing to cover it.\u201d\n\nThe cheapest homeowners insurance isn\u2019t always the best, O\u2019Hare warns, because you want to make sure you have enough coverage when you need it. However, she says, there are a few ways to save on your premiums.\n\n\u201cAdding a centrally monitored security system, such as ADT or another system monitored by a third party that will alert the police or fire company for you, can save 5 to 15 percent on your premiums,\u201d she says. \u201cChoosing a higher deductible, such as $1,000 to $5,000, also usually lowers your premium.\u201d\n\nOwning a historic house comes with a special responsibility to protect its heritage.
