This can be explained by two factors, which are animal health and the changing climate. First, the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak that occurred in earlier this year resulted in a temporary ban of South Africa\u2019s beef and other livestock products exports. This continued for months while the authorities were still doing inspections and applying control measures, and thus, its impact is reflected in the trade data for the first half of this year. The beef industry is now back in export markets,1 but the wool industry continues to struggle to access the Chinese market as negotiations to resume exports are still underway.\n\nSecond, the drought that started in October 2018 and continued into early 2019 in some parts of South Africa led to a poor summer crop and horticulture harvest. For example, the major summer crops, which performed poorly during the 2018/19 production season \u2013 maize, and seed production are down by 12% y/y, 21% y/y and 24% y/y, to 11.02 million tonnes, 1.17 million tonnes and 680 940 tonnes, respectively. Moreover, the wine grapes harvest was down by 2% from 2018. All this subsequently led to lower export volumes in the second quarter of this year compared to a corresponding period in 2018.\n\nFrom a destination point of view, the African continent and Europe continued to be the largest markets for South Africa\u2019s agricultural exports, respectively accounting for 40% and 26% in value terms. Asia was the third-largest market, taking up 24% of South Africa\u2019s agricultural exports in the second quarter of 2019. The balance of 10% value was spread across other regions of the world.\n\nOverall, while South Africa\u2019s agricultural trade balance could narrow this year because of the aforementioned animal health and unfavourable weather impact, we expect it to remain in positive territory.\n\nIn terms of national policy, in his 2019 State of the Nation Address, President Ramaphosa signalled that potential expansion in agricultural production would mainly be on exportoriented products. There is already a clear pathway for this initiative as South Africa is wellpositioned in terms of export markets, and there is clarity about products that show a growing demand in the world market, such as horticulture products, and livestock, to a certain extent, to mention a few categories.\n\nWeekly highlights\n\nSA agricultural economy contracted in Q2, 2019\n\nAlthough South Africa\u2019s economy has recovered from the previous quarter\u2019s economic performance with a 3.1% quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted growth rate (q/q saar), agriculture did not contribute to the improvement. After a strong contraction (16.8% -- revised numbers) during the first quarter of 2019, we were optimistic that things would turn around for South African agriculture. We hoped that base effects coupled with improved citrus production would trigger a recovery for the sector. However, we were wrong.\n\nData shows that the sector is in recession -- having contracted a further 4.2% q/q/ saar in the second quarter of 2019, largely owing to poor field crop harvest, as a result of droughts earlier this year (Figure 2). Given both the data and our observations of broader agricultural activity, we believe that South Africa\u2019s agricultural sector will underperform in 2019. We predict that the sector will contract by approximately 2% y/y this year, because of generally poor summer grains and oilseed harvest in the 2018/19 production season.\n\nSentiments across the South African farming environment is relatively negative. The Agbiz/IDC Agribusiness Confidence Index, which has historically proved to be a good indicator of the growth path of the South African agricultural economy, has been rather unstable in the most recent quarters, but remains in the contractionary territory, having eased 44 points in the second quarter of 2019. This is below the neutral 50-point mark and reflects the negative perceptions held by agribusinesses about South Africa\u2019s business climate. Given that the sector\u2019s poor performance is largely due to unfavourable weather conditions, prospects of higher-than-average rainfall in the 2019/20 summer season provide hope that the blip will be short-lived and that gains are just around the corner (2020).", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Wandile Sihlobo covering: US Soybeans Futures, Sunflower Seed Futures.
