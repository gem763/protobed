I was mortified, scared, and hopeless.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I questioned my growth a few years ago when my feet shot up half a size, but I had gained weight too and I thought it must have been caused by water retention or my borderline diabetes diagnosis.\u2019\n\nThe tumour was removed through her nasal cavity (Picture: MDWfeatures / Rebecca Churan)\n\nThe tumour in the brain was then taken out through the nasal cavity. Rebecca said she was petrified of surgery but it was a better option than letting her body continue becoming disfigured.\n\n\u2018After having the tumour removed, my nose and chin have shrunk, while my feet are down a size and a half,\u2019 she explained.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve also lost two stone and five pounds effortlessly. I lost almost an inch off the tops of my fingers and the width of each finger has gone down by about half a centimetre.\u2019\n\nRebecca hopes to encourage others with an unexplainable problem to stay positive and push for answers.\n\nShe was misdiagnosed for many years and was even led to believe she was developing diabetes, but a simple blood test was all it took to uncover the truth.\n\nRebecca\u2019s hand measurements before and shortly after surgery to remove the tumour which secreted excess growth hormone (Picture: MDWfeatures / Rebecca Churan)\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t just accept any diagnosis without digging deeper and asking if something else could be causing it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Never judge a book by its cover because those covers can be redrawn, just like more pages can be added to a story.\u2019\n\nMORE: Mum\u2019s brain tumour undetected for 10 years because she thought she was just tired\n\nMORE: Woman who thought she was suffering with hay fever actually had a brain tumour\n\nMORE: Girl\u2019s dilated pupils were sign that she had devastating brain tumour\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "A blood test confirmed that Rebecca Churan had a pituitary tumour which was releasing the growth hormone.", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_93884848_1572450303.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
