The 29-year-old fruit seller is still detained and has been sent to a prison hundreds of kilometres away.\n\nWani is one of thousands of people reportedly detained in mass arrests in the disputed Himalayan region, which has faced a security crackdown since India\u2019s prime minister, Hindu nationalist Narendra Modi, revoked the Muslim majority state\u2019s semi-autonomous status in August.\n\nFamily demand justice for Kashmiri teenager killed in 'unprovoked attack' Read more\n\nWani\u2019s parents traveled around 1,000km (620 miles) by bus to visit him in Agra central jail last week. \u201cYou have no idea how I arranged the money for the travel,\u201d his father, Ghulam Nabi Wani, said. \u201cHe has changed so much physically, he has become weak and he shivers while talking.\u201d\n\n\n\nWani was arrested on 9 August, during protests in Srinagar against the Indian government.\n\nHis family said he was captured after his legs were injured by pellet fire. The family said they approached the police with a bail order to release him, but officers slapped Wani with harsher charges \u2013 accusing him of offences under the controversial Public Safety Act (PSA), which allows police to detain people for up to two years. Amnesty International describes it as a \u201clawless law\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou are instrumental in mobilising anti-national elements for creating havoc \u2026 your acts are aimed at keeping the state on boil in the ongoing unrest and thereby bringing secession of J&K [Jammu and Kashmir] from Union of India,\u201d reads a government document detailing the grounds for Wani\u2019s detention.\n\nWani\u2019s family deny the charges and portray him as a quiet, peaceful family man, with a wife and three-year-old daughter who were the centre of his world. Wani was so poor, they said, that he could not afford doors and windows for his two-room house.\n\nHis father believes his son has become a target for Indian authorities because he is from Anchar \u2014 a neighbourhood that has become a symbolic outpost of resistance against Indian forces in the region.\n\nIn the run-up to Delhi\u2019s announcement that it would revoke Kashmir\u2019s special status, tens of thousands of extra troops were deployed to the already heavily militarised region. But one place Indian forces have been unable to control is Anchar, where students, tradespeople and housewives have rebuffed troops by digging trenches and making barricades out of rocks, water tanks and concrete pillars. Anchar has been turned into a small enclave of hope for many Kashmiris.\n\nAccording to Wani\u2019s parents, the neighbourhood\u2019s role in resisting Indian forces has led to the prolonged imprisonment of their son.\n\nAn Indian government official, who spoke anonymously, said that decisions on detentions were being made at a local level to maintain law and order. \u201cThe detentions are preventive in nature and are being continuously reviewed. Appropriate decisions will be made based on law and order assessments,\u201d the official said. There has been no official comment on Wani\u2019s case.\n\nMy son is one of Kashmir\u2019s \u2018disappeared\u2019. When will India tell the truth about their fate? | Parveena Ahangar Read more\n\nOutside Agra central jail, families wait to visit their relatives. Some carry bags of apples from Kashmir\u2019s orchards, a reminder of home, as well as medicines and dry biscuits. Enough snacks are brought so that gifts can be shared with the other inmates. It is understood that around 80 Kashmiris, including high-profile figures such as the president of the bar association of Kashmir, are detained inside. Most families can\u2019t afford to make the journey to Agra, which takes up to 48 hours by bus.\n\nOne visitor, who asked not to be named, said his brother-in-law was being held under the PSA. Among families, he said, there was a feeling \u201cof helplessness of not being able to do anything. Honestly speaking, I don\u2019t have much faith in the system.\u201d\n\nThe family has tried to challenge the detention in the courts, but government lawyers have not yet responded. \u201cUntil and unless the government does file a proper reply to the court, there is no way that we can counter it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHe is someone who would always be busy working and all of sudden you are confined to [a] 10-by-10-m cell,\u201d he added. His brother-in-law wept when his daughter visited him. \u201cShe [the daughter] doesn\u2019t have a choice, she has to cope,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nBack in Kashmir, people lived in fear, said another relative. \u201cAnybody can stop you, anybody can take [arrest] you,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no accountability. The moment you speak out you are in jail.\u201d\n\nColin Gonsalves, a senior lawyer at Delhi-based Human Rights Law Network, said India\u2019s \u201csledgehammer approach\u201d in Kashmir raised a host of human rights issues. \u201cThe security forces are taking extreme and vindictive steps that are difficult for the state to justify,\u201d he said.\n\nWani\u2019s parents were only able to spend 30 minutes with him last week. \u201cHe missed his daughter very much, his soul is his daughter,\u201d said Wani\u2019s mother, Fatima. They would have taken his daughter to Agra, but it is too far for her to travel.\n\n\u201cEven if they want to detain him for long, they should at least lodge him closer to home. It is very difficult for us to reach Agra. It is very far place,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI have lost my heart,\u201d she added. \u201cI have my heart and soul in him.\u201d", "description": "Relatives tell of 1,000km bus journeys to Agra where prisoners are held after Modi crackdown", "authors": ["Rebecca Ratcliffe", "A Reporter In Srinagar", "Ahmer Khan"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71b768041b10ee5293c0d231cccfd10cac73ac0b/0_624_4160_2496/master/4160.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=209e06897ca422c0f5dbf48f0644ed45", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
