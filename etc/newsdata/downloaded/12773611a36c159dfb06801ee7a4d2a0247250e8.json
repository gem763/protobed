Not anymore though,\u201d began another.\n\n\u201cGreat that a company is putting its values however misguided before profit. That\u2019s very sweet of them that they are prepared to lose their customers over this. Oops.\u201d\n\nUpfield made its decision after concerns were raised online about Mumsnet content.\n\n\u201cWe've investigated,\u201d tweeted the brand in response to user @mimmymum, who queried how its brand values of inclusion aligned with transphobic remarks found on Mumsnet forums.\n\n\u201cWe are wholly committed to our values, which include treating everyone equally, so have made the decision to no longer work with Mumsnet. #DiversityMatters @Flora\u201d\n\nFormer Mumsnet employees have also accused site editors of ignoring concerns raised by staff around transphobic posts and of dismissing any criticism as \u201csmear attempts\u201d by \u201ctrans activists\u201d.\n\nIn December 2018, a Vice article found Mumsnet was used to organise action against trans-inclusive policies announced by Girlguiding.\n\nUsers were also encouraged to respond to Gender Recognition Act proposals \u2013 which would allow trans people the power of self-identification \u2013 by taking part in \"Man Friday\", a campaign asking cisgender women to \u201cidentify as men on Fridays\u201d.\n\n\"Mumsnet will always stand in solidarity with minority communities,\" a Mumsnet statement on Twitter read.\n\n\"We don\u2019t tolerate transphobic comments and will delete any when they are flagged to us. But we do also believe strongly in free speech.\n\nThe discussion of gender self-id and what that might mean for very hard-won women\u2019s rights, as well as the rapidly growing number of children exploring gender identity issues, is contentious.\n\nWe know some people would like us to simply censor this entire debate but a similar number think we censor too much. We\u2019re committed to allowing respectful discussion of an issue that is of particular interest to parents.\"\n\nMumsnet founder Justine Roberts introduced new forum moderation rules in June 2018 after complaints and denied the site allowed unchecked transphobia.\n\nHowever, although the regulations stated that moderators would be likely to delete comments including transphobic phrases like \u201cTrans-Idenitified Male\u201d, used to refer to trans women, they would also crack down on uses of \u201ccisgender\u201d and \u201cTERF\u201d.\n\nThe term TERF is an acronym for Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminists. It\u2019s commonly used to describe individuals who identify as feminists but hold views that are considered as being hostile to trans individuals.\n\nMs Roberts has previously said that complaints to Mumsnet advertisers about the platform enabling transphobic sentiment to flourish is \u201cthought-police action\u201d.\n\nIt is estimated that only one per cent of the UK population identifies as trans, yet research shows two in five trans individuals have experienced a hate crime in the last 12 months.\n\nFigures released in June revealed transgender hate crimes recorded by police had risen by 81 per cent in England, Scotland and Wales from April 2018 to April 2019.", "description": "Users of parenting site Mumsnet\u00a0have announced they will boycott margarine product Flora following a transphobia row.", "authors": ["Moya Lothian-Mclean"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/14/13/8719200007116-beauty-shot-720.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
