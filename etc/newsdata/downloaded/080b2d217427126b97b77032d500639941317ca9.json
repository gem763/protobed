But I think most EU countries would really only consider it for a good reason, and that reason would have to be put forward. But certainly, an extension would be better than 'no deal',\" he said.\n\nJohnson has also previously said that Britain will leave the EU, \"do or die\", on October 31. His various contradictory statements remain unexplained, prompting speculation that he will seek a legal escape route or pressure the EU into refusing an automatic extension request.\n\nFriday's court case comes just over a week after Johnson was humiliated by a landmark Supreme Court ruling that he had suspended parliament unlawfully.", "description": "Boris Johnson will write to the EU seeking another Brexit extension if a deal has not been agreed by October 19, according to government papers submitted to a Scottish court.", "authors": ["Pauline Bock"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/20/48/24/1000x563_cmsv2_f58513ee-a70a-5163-af6c-8e957b467965-4204824.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
