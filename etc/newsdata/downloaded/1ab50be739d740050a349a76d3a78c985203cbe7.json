Tulsi Gabbard and hedge-fund billionaire Tom Steyer, are slated to get spots on the debate stage after failing to qualify for last month\u2019s clash. That has raised the total number of invited contenders from 10 to a dozen.\n\nThe debate, run by AT&T\u2019s T, +0.43% CNN and the New York Times NYT, +1.74% , is due to start at 8 p.m. Eastern time on Tuesday at Otterbein University in Westerville, a northeastern suburb of Columbus.\n\nWarren, the progressive Massachusetts senator, may be seeking to reassure her critics during the debate, said Mitchell McKinney, a professor of political communication at the University of Missouri. McKinney said Warren\u2019s message may boil down to the following: \u201cYou can commit to me. I am a safe candidate. I will be a strong candidate. Let\u2019s rethink your notions of the safe candidate.\u201d\n\nWhile Warren edged past Biden in a widely followed average of polls during the past week, some centrist Democrats continue to worry about her policy plans that target Wall Street and other sectors. Party fundraisers \u201cthink Warren can\u2019t win the presidency \u2014 and they know she represents a real threat to their companies and their tax rates,\u201d said Greg Valliere, chief U.S. policy strategist at AGF Investments, in a recent note.\n\nRead more: RBC says the Warren stock-market fall will happen sooner than you think\n\nAlso see: Survey of investors shows growing anxiety over Warren\u2019s rise in polls\n\nAnd: Watch Elizabeth Warren\u2019s response to a gay-marriage question bring down the house\n\nPlus: 1 in 5 LGBTQ adults isn\u2019t registered to vote, despite high 2020 stakes\n\nMizzou\u2019s McKinney said Warren will have to be careful in terms of going directly after Biden, given how Democrats felt about attacks on him in prior debates by California Sen. Kamala Harris and Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former Housing and Urban Development secretary. The Massachusetts lawmaker also will have to take care in how she interacts with Sanders, as she wants to avoid looking like she\u2019s aiming to \u201ckick him when he\u2019s down,\u201d McKinney added.\n\nFor Biden, one key will be to \u201cdemonstrate to voters that he\u2019s vigorously able to take it to Donald Trump\u201d and also \u201cstand up for himself, his family,\u201d McKinney said. Republicans have emphasized the former vice president\u2019s link to the impeachment effort, which was announced on Sept. 24 and is centered on how Trump asked his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Biden and his son.\n\nRead more: Ukraine reviews probe into company whose board included Biden\u2019s son\n\nMeanwhile, the 78-year-old Sanders faces a \u201ccrucial moment\u201d following his Oct. 1 heart attack, according to McKinney. \u201cIf he\u2019s able to turn in a performance that shows us he hasn\u2019t missed a beat, so to speak, that he\u2019s the same old Bernie Sanders \u2014 aggressive, passionate \u2014 then that will go far to allay questions and fears that maybe he doesn\u2019t have what it takes to run the course,\u201d said the professor, an expert on presidential debates.\n\nOpinion: Sanders and Biden are too old to be president \u2014 and so is Trump\n\nAnd read: Sanders unveils plan targeting money in politics as concerns grow over his heart attack\n\nCNN This CNN graphic shows how candidates will be arranged Tuesday on the debate stage.\n\nThe dozen Democrats who have qualified for Tuesday\u2019s debate are Biden, Warren, Sanders, Harris, Castro, Gabbard and Steyer, as well as South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg; entrepreneur Andrew Yang; former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas; Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey; and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.\n\nIn a RealClearPolitics moving average of polls on Friday, Biden had regained front-runner status, scoring 27.8% support vs. Warren\u2019s 26%. Sanders drew 15.2% support, topping Buttigieg at 5%, Harris at 4.5% and Yang at 2.7%. All other Democratic candidates hoping to challenge Trump in November 2020 are below 2%. Ahead of the Sept. 12 debate, Biden was drawing support of 27% vs. 17% each for Warren and Sanders.\n\nRelated: Some 2020 Democrats are angling for the vice president slot \u2014 a gambit that rarely pays off\n\nAnd read: 19 Democrats are running for president, after more exits from the race\n\nWhile Gabbard and Steyer have made the cut for the debate, each faces a tricky path, according to McKinney. Gabbard, who took part in June\u2019s and July\u2019s primary debates, has threatened to boycott Tuesday\u2019s event, saying the Democratic National Committee and media are trying to \u201crig the 2020 primary.\u201d But she might not necessarily be missed and may be anticipating that she won\u2019t qualify for next month\u2019s debate, the University of Missouri professor said. And Steyer, who is appearing in a 2020 debate for the first time, likely holds minimal appeal to the many Democratic voters who don\u2019t want to see another wealthy businessman with no political experience move into the White House, McKinney added.\n\nTo qualify for the fifth primary debate in November, candidates will need to have at least 165,000 unique donors, as well as hit 3% support in at least four national or early state polls \u2014 or 5% in two early-state polls. That\u2019s up from the previously required 130,000 donors and 2% support.\n\nNow read: Warren tops Biden in third-quarter fundraising, but both lag Sanders", "description": "Tuesday\u2019s Democratic presidential debate will have a significantly different backdrop than prior ones.
