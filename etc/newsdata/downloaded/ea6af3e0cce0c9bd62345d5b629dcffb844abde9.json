Ito said this past week that he had taken $525,000 of Epstein's money for the lab and $1.2 million for investment funds he controlled separately.\n\nBut documents obtained by The New Yorker showed that the lab had been aware of Epstein's status as a convicted sex offender and continuing to accept money from him, marking his contributions as anonymous.\n\nEpstein had solicited millions of dollars in donations from individuals and organizations, including Microsoft founder Bill Gates and investor Leon Black, according to The New Yorker. He secured at least $7.5 million in donations for the lab, including $2 million dollars from Gates and $5.5 million from Black, the magazine reported.\n\nA Gates spokesperson said on Saturday that Epstein was introduced to Gates \"as someone who was interested in helping grow philanthropy\" but that \"any claim that Epstein directed any programmatic or personal grantmaking for Bill Gates is completely false.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Black declined to comment.\n\n- CNBC's Brian Schwartz contributed reporting", "description": "Ito said this past week that he had taken $525,000 of Epstein's money for the lab and $1.2 million for investment funds he controlled separately.", "authors": ["Emma Newburger"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106011375-15627624058692019-07-08t201708z_511060801_rc1684cbf630_rtrmadp_3_people-jeffrey-epstein.jpg?v=1562762457", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
