(AP) - Early in high school, Kayla Flanders was shocked when she realized how little she knew about organ donation. She spent the rest of her time at RVRHS teaching hundreds of driver\u2019s ed students what it really means.\n\nThere might be some newly licensed drivers on the road who wouldn\u2019t have registered to become organ donors if Kayla Flanders hadn\u2019t told them all about it in school.\n\nThe Rancocas Valley Regional High School alumna spoke to hundreds of students taking driver\u2019s education when she was a student advocate for the New Jersey Sharing Network.\n\nNow a freshman studying chemical biology at St. Joseph\u2019s University, Flanders was named the recipient of a scholarship from the nonprofit group in September. Flanders was awarded with the Missy\u2019s Miracle scholarship, named after Missy Rodriguez, a Short Hills college counselor and mother of three who had a liver transplant 30 years ago, and set up a foundation to provide college scholarships for organ donors and transplant recipients.\n\nFlanders first heard of the group two years ago when she saw a representative present at a leadership conference she was attending.\n\n\u201cI was shocked that I barely knew anything about the topic,\u201d said Flanders, a Hainesport native. \u201cI instantly felt the desire to combat such a minimization of the impact it can have on so many lives.\u201d\n\nFlanders is one of six students statewide who earned an award from the nonprofit group, which works closely with hospitals around the state to educate residents on organ donation.\n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s NJ Sharing Network scholarship recipients are a unique group of young people dedicated to raising awareness of organ donation,\u201d Joe Roth, president and CEO of the NJ Sharing Network, said in a news release. \u201cWe know they will continue to make great strides when they start college this fall.\u201d\n\nFlanders said she\u2019d like to continue educating communities on the ins and outs of organ donation. It\u2019s even influenced her future career goals as a scientist seeking to help others through innovations in health. She\u2019s currently exploring the more scientific side of the process by working in a research lab on her university\u2019s campus, studying oxygen in the bloodstream.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping to better understand how organ donation works from a new perspective,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m working on starting a project in the spring semester on ethical considerations with organ donation so I can continue reaching out to small groups for educational presentations.\u201d\n\nThough some people may be uncomfortable with becoming organ donors, Flanders said what matters most is that they make an informed decision.\n\n\u201cWith any uncomfortable or big decision, being fully educated makes a world of a difference,\u201d Flanders said. \u201cMake sure you are saying no because you don\u2019t want to, not because you don\u2019t know what it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much to organ donation besides donation of the main organs people think of,\u201d she said. \u201cTissue donation is a topic many aren\u2019t aware of, yet it has to potential to save so many lives - burn victims, athletes with torn ACL.\u201d\n\nLooking back on her studies at RV, Flanders said she was surprised by how many students weren\u2019t fully aware of what it means to become an organ donor. She hopes to keep raising awareness and help others figure out if it\u2019s the right choice for them.\n\n\u201cEnsuring there is a conversation about organ donation is so important to me because so often, students I speak to will come up to me after presentations and comment on how they never would have become organ donors on their own,\u201d Flanders explained. \u201cThe impact organ donation has on a community - whether it\u2019s the person on the waiting list, their families, or even the families of the donors - is something that opens students\u2019 eyes.\u201d\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2VACpbq\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Burlington County Times (Willingboro, N.J.), http://www.burlingtoncountytimes.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Early in high school, Kayla Flanders was shocked when she realized how little she knew about organ donation.
