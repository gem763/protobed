There are 400 miles of coast, due to its distinctive peninsular extrusions, across which weather sweeps to kaleidoscopic effect, from lead-grey to piercing sunlight flashing the hills tweedy green, brown and vivid gorse-yellow. Sometimes baleful blue, sometimes flaring orange, igneous and metamorphic mountains surge up with boiling fury to where eagles soar. Rather than cutting through these prehistoric ramparts, most principal roads run around their edges, giving constantly changing watery views. To get about, driving is essential.\n\nThe extent of my previous Highland experience was limited to the romantic 1945 Powell and Pressburger film I Know Where I\u2019m Going!, in which Wendy Hiller takes a sleeper to an invented Highland island to marry one man, but falls for another. And since I don\u2019t drive and avoid flying, when a friend moved here two years ago, I determined to visit \u2013 by sleeper. Robert had sent tantalising photos of the world-famous Cuillin mountain range of 60 million-year-old glaciated lava; of dramatic lochs; of black-faced sheep nimbly scrambling up high hillsides, and of Skye\u2019s numberless bays and inlets. It looked like paradise: though one involving lots of jumpers.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nMy plan was just to mosey around and try not to irritate the locals with my southern ways. Skye is the second most popular Scottish destination after Edinburgh, and its 10,000 inhabitants see tourism \u2013 especially the cars and camper-vans clogging the narrow, rough roads, some with hairpin bends \u2013 as a mixed blessing. But the local business of crofting (small-scale food production) has died out, so tourism, agriculture, fishing and forestry are the main industries. However, Robert had told me of young islanders who\u2019d started community-led ventures, which I was keen to see.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

I\u2019d studied timetables in case daytime trains could be cheaper, changing at Glasgow or Inverness; but the need to stay overnight somewhere foxed that. And a sleeper return costs loads more than flying. But if you adore trains, taking things slowly and taking them in \u2013 along with saving the planet and channelling the Orient Express \u2013 there\u2019s really no alternative. And after the sleeper comes the delightful two-and-a-half-hour cross-country single-track chuffer from Inverness to Kyle of Lockalsh, the gateway to the Skye bridge. This gorgeous ride bombards passengers with near-constant panoramas of loch and sea, connects neatly with the sleeper, and has a coffee cart. It ran on perfect time.\n\nWe pulled out of Euston at 9.15pm. The much-vaunted new Caledonian Sleepers have been beset by delays on the Highland line. The latest update is that they\u2019re \u201cunlikely\u201d to replace the old bone-shakers with their rather tired blue cabins before September, though they\u2019re already running up to Edinburgh and Glasgow. Seasoned passengers, fond of the faded grandeur and charming stewards aren\u2019t bothered, but the new trains offer a smoother, quieter night\u2019s sleep. Their boutiquey decor of beiges and tans is suave; cabins have a cuter basin and some even have loos and showers \u2013 extraordinary luxury after lurching along narrow corridors on the old trains to find the bog occupied or out of order. The doors have key cards, whereas currently anyone can invade your cabin if you aren\u2019t in it. And on the new trains, as well as wifi, you can still get a Famous Grouse for \u00a34.20, whether in a cabin or a seat.\n\nOnce on Skye, many walkers base themselves in the diminutive capital Portree on the southernmost part of the Trotternish peninsula. It offers boat tours, has a big Co-op, restaurants and a photogenic curved harbour ringed by old houses. However, I was off the beaten track, where on walks the silence was broken only by loud bees, birdsong and an occasional burn. It felt centuries away from city life.\n\nMy modest wish list included a tour of the Talisker distillery at Carbost, the only whisky distillery on Skye. I was surprised by how complex its manufacture is, and that it matures at least three years in an oak barrel before getting called whisky. I loved the towering copper stills, like gigantic fantasy wind instruments.\n\nBut what most impressed me, apart from the jaw-dropping grandeur of the sheep-dotted landscape, were young entrepreneurs. On the north coast of Loch Harport, we lunched in the Bog Myrtle cafe and book shop \u2013 a big second-hand bookshop holding a friendly and charming cafe run by young marrieds Andrew and Firuza Annis. Fresh soup with bread was \u00a34.25. The cakes are homemade, and there was \u2013 of course! How soon it became natural \u2013 a wide view of water thrown in.\n\nOpposite the Talisker Distillery, Jamie Fletcher runs a groovy coffee shack called Caora Dhubh (Black Sheep). He\u2019s a delight, the coffee was great (espresso \u00a32.20), and people lounged happily in the sun on a bench outside. For a moment \u2013 dare I say it \u2013 it felt almost urban.\n\nFor a grand treat we sampled the weekend tasting menu at renowned gourmet destination The Three Chimneys on the shores of Loch Dunvegan. It\u2019s surprisingly soothing to watch chefs working away as you devour six picture-perfect courses in a memorable two-hour experience.\n\nAfter three days on Skye, I toyed with exchanging rats for untamed weather that dazzles or drenches, monumental hills and crags; and sea-light from limpid aquamarine to palest rose quartz \u2013 but hell, I still can\u2019t drive; and hey ho, somewhere in another world the sleeper waited.\n\nTravel essentials\n\nGetting there\n\nSeats on the new Caledonian Sleeper from \u00a345, classic rooms (no en suite) from \u00a3140 single occupancy, club rooms (with en suite) from \u00a3205 single occupancy, double bedroom (with en suite) from \u00a3400 shared.
