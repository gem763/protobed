But he decided against it after the Taliban claimed responsibility for a car bombing near the U.S. embassy in Kabul Thursday that killed 12 people \u2014including a U.S. soldier.\n\nAmericans were stunned.\n\nThe U.S. and Taliban had reach some kind of deal \u201con principle\u201d so American forces can get out of Afghanistan. But it was an agreement that Trump\u2019s national security adviser, John Bolton, considered inadequate, Bloomberg reported. So Trump aimed to fix things himself.\n\nNow peace talks are off the table, the president tweeted.\n\nCritics on Twitter lashed the planned meeting just days before the 9/11 anniversary with militants American soldiers have been fighting for years. In a July video the Taliban just justified the 9/11 attacks as payback for America\u2019s \u201cinterventionist policies.\u201d\n\nOthers pointed out Trump\u2019s hypocrisy concerning Barack Obama, whom he blasted years ago for planning to negotiate with America\u2019s \u201csworn enemy\u201d \u2014 the Taliban.\n\nSo, @realDonaldTrump was going to fly Taliban terrorists to Camp David but didn\u2019t because he found out the Taliban kill people? #Absurd #25thammendmentnow \u2014 Montel Williams (@Montel_Williams) September 8, 2019\n\nTrump canceled a meeting with Denmark because he was upset at how they rebuffed his idea to sell Greenland to the USA, but actually invited the leaders of the Taliban to meet with him at Camp David just days before 9/11?\n\n\n\nJust think about how insane that is. \u2014 Josh Jordan (@NumbersMuncher) September 8, 2019\n\nNot to be that guy, but just imagine if Obama invited the Taliban to the United States for talks days ahead of the anniversary of September 11th. \u2014 Oliver Darcy (@oliverdarcy) September 8, 2019\n\nWhat\u2019s more disgusting than the President of the United States almost playing golf with the Taliban on the anniversary of 9/11 after GOP lawmakers delayed payments to 9/11 first responders for so long that some died of cancer before getting the help they needed? GOP hates the US. \u2014 Eugene Gu, MD (@eugenegu) September 8, 2019\n\nThe Taliban were probably going to refuel/overnight at Turnberry. \u2014 Dana Shell Smith (@AmbDana) September 8, 2019\n\nRemember when a black president innocently fist bumped his wife and Fox News called it a \u270c\ud83c\udffbterrorist fist jab\u270c\ud83c\udffb and now a white president is casually tweeting about chilling with the Taliban \u2014 The Volatile Mermaid (@OhNoSheTwitnt) September 8, 2019\n\nTrump refused to meet with Robert Mueller face to face but he invited the Taliban to spend time with him at Camp David. \u2014 Adam Parkhomenko (@AdamParkhomenko) September 8, 2019\n\nYou brought the Taliban to the United States the week of September 11? https://t.co/oxXYweNAOi \u2014 Rep. Eric Swalwell (@RepSwalwell) September 8, 2019\n\nMattis says he'll \"break his silence in the case of a truly monumental Trump outrage, an eventuality that he has likened to pornography, in that, he told Amanpour, 'I\u2019ll know it when I see it.'\"\n\nDoes seeing Trump invite the Taliban to Camp David qualify?https://t.co/3BwUovy8lP \u2014 Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) September 8, 2019\n\nI have to admit that I did not have \"secretly invite the Taliban to Camp David three days before 9/11\" on my Donald Trump Batshittery Bingo Card \u2014 Jeff Tiedrich (@itsJeffTiedrich) September 8, 2019\n\nLots to tout. North Korea is building new nukes. Iran restarted its nuclear program. Maduro still in power. China trade war dragging down economy. India power play in Kashmir. Jared\u2019s assistant doing ME peace. Respect for US at historic lows. The Taliban coming to Camp David (?!) https://t.co/Nq0waa1rpc \u2014 Ben Rhodes (@brhodes) September 8, 2019\n\nSo since Trump had to cancel peace talks with the Taliban at Camp David tomorrow is he gonna invite ISIS to play golf tomorrow instead? \u2014 Alison Greene (@GrassrootsSpeak) September 8, 2019\n\n\u201cHow to #MAGA\u201d\n\n~by Donald J Trump.\n\n\n\nStep 1\u2014Ban Muslims \u201cuntil we know what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\n\n\nStep 2\u2014Invite the #Taliban to Camp David right before 9/11.\n\n\n\nStep 3\u2014Deport Marines who were injured fighting the Taliban.\n\n\n\nStep 4\u2014Say \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d a few times.\n\n\n\nStep 5\u2014#Sharpie everything. \u2014 J\u039bK\u03a3 (@USMCLiberal) September 8, 2019\n\nHaving the Taliban over to celebrate 9/11 and have no idea whether or not I can serve Impossible burgers. Is this something they can/will eat? Help!! #goodhosting \u2014 )))David Cross((( (@davidcrosss) September 8, 2019\n\nThis is your regular reminder when Donald Trump is artofthedealmaking: He is an abysmal dealmaker and that has been true since at least the late 1980s. It\u2019s just happening on a bigger and more consequential stage now. https://t.co/5OCtIBGKlz \u2014 Tim O'Brien (@TimOBrien) September 8, 2019\n\nInviting the Taliban to Camp David the week of 9/11 is an entirely different level than just negotiating with terrorists.\n\nThe silence from Republican\u2019ts is deafening. \u2014 Randy Bryce (@IronStache) September 8, 2019\n\nHow do I know #MAGA is a cult? Because they\u2019re already praising Trump for \u201ccancelling his meeting with the Taliban\u201d (that\u2019ll show the Taliban!) rather than being mortified that there ever was a meeting with the Taliban at Camp David 4 days before 9/11. \u2014 Andrew Wortman (@AmoneyResists) September 8, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s not like he invited them to camp david..... (of course there\u2019s a chance trump never invited the taliban to camp david because the president is a huge liar) pic.twitter.com/7pLBnKk7An \u2014 Molly Jong-Fast (@MollyJongFast) September 8, 2019\n\nThis July, the Taliban was defending 9/11. https://t.co/Coq9jwnvcZ \u2014 Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) September 8, 2019\n\nThe Taliban called me, begging for a meeting. Big, tough Taliban guy. And he\u2019s crying. Tears running down his eyes. And he says to me, \u201cSir, thank you for working to end the war.\u201d But I had to say no. \ud83d\ude44https://t.co/MZybcET868 \u2014 David Waldman-1, of Yorktown LLC\u2122 (@KagroX) September 8, 2019", "description": "He \"found out the Taliban kill people\" just before the anniversary of 9/11, one wag scoffed.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d74814d2300001d0351275f.jpeg?cache=sllimo6rpx&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
