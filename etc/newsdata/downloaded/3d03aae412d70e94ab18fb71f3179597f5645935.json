Can't see why anybody would send it.\"\n\nAfter fans reassured her it looked authentic, she changed her mind, writing: \"If I'd known that card was genuine I would have put on a nicer tablecloth before I took the pics.\n\n\"But thanks for the card - I'm AMAZED and very touched.\"\n\n'Experimental side'\n\nColdplay are the biggest-selling British band of the 21st Century. According to the Official Charts Company, they have three of the top 20 best-selling albums of the Millennium, led by 2002's A Rush Of Blood To The Head.\n\nTheir last record, A Head Full Of Dreams, was an uplifting, multicoloured dalliance with pop that saw the band collaborate with Beyonce, Stargate and Swedish pop maverick Tove Lo. It sold more than 2 million copies, and spawned 122-date world tour that grossed $523m (\u00a3402m) at the box office.\n\nIt was followed up by a companion EP, Kaleidoscope, and a side project with Pharrell Williams under the name Los Unidades, but the band have largely been silent since 2017.\n\nRumours of their return were sparked last week, when black-and-white posters appeared in Madrid, showing the band dressed as a 1920s wedding band, sitting next to a man who appeared to be German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, holding a saxophone.\n\nImage copyright Coldplay Image caption Posters recently appeared in Madrid depicting Coldplay as a turn-of-the-century wedding band\n\nThe band's website was later updated to show a logo of the sun and moon, reflecting what we now know to be the album title, while a snippet of orchestral music was posted to their Twitter account over the weekend.\n\nLittle else is known about the record but last year, frequent collaborator Mat Whitecross told the NME it would \"surprise people\", while an unnamed \"insider\" recently told the Daily Star the album would showcase their \"experimental side\".\n\nAn Italian fan site also posted a proposed tracklist for the first half of the double album, which suggested one of the tracks featured French dance pioneers Daft Punk. However, the information was unverified and potentially fake.\n\nIn their letter to Lena, the band simply said the record \"is sort of how we feel about things\".\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
