He told the crowd, many of whom were holding little American flags, that it was time to \u201cwake up people.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe got a queer running for president if that ain\u2019t about as ugly as you can get,\u201d he said, in comments captured by Knoxville-based station WVLT. \u201cLook what we got running for president in the Democratic Party. We can go over here to Hoss\u2019 jail [the Sevier County sheriff] and get better people out of there than those running for [the] Democratic [nomination] to be president of the United States.\u201d\n\nPete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is running in the Democratic primary. If elected, he would be the first openly gay president. His campaign didn\u2019t immediately return a request for comment.\n\nAt least one woman objected to Hurst\u2019s remarks and stormed out, but others applauded and agreed with him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not prejudiced, but by golly, a white male in this country has very few rights and they\u2019re getting took more every day,\u201d the commissioner added.\n\nIn a follow-up interview with WVLT, he stood by his comments and noted that he has some Black friends. HuffPost repeatedly attempted to contact Hurst, but his line was busy.\n\n\u201cSevier County Commissioner Warren Hurst is using his position of power to publicly spew bigotry against LGBTQ people \u2015 people who are very likely his own constituents. A group of people having rights doesn\u2019t take away those of another,\u201d said Nick Morrow, a spokesman with the LGBTQ equality group Human Rights Campaign. Morrow grew up one county over from Sevier. \u201cBut with LGBTQ people running for office at every level of government and more and more people voting for candidates who support equality, he should be more worried about losing his seat than losing his rights.\u201d", "description": "\u201cI\u2019m not prejudiced, but by golly, a white male in this country has very few rights and they\u2019re getting took more every day.\u201d", "authors": ["Washington Bureau Chief"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5daf2249210000ab21ad391d.png?cache=dtd69hc0tj&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
