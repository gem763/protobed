The researchers mix three different colors of the dye (cyan, magenta, and yellow) with car laquer. Then they combine all three.\n\nThe resultant mixture is sprayed onto an object, a phone case or example, and then placed in front of a light projector. The researchers design patterns on 3D computer models, and project the desired pattern onto the object.\n\nYou can watch the ink in action here:\n\nNot only can designs be projected onto the objects, they can be erased and re-designed just as easily.\n\nThe scientists give an example of how this could be useful in their paper: \"in clothing, accessories could be altered to match the main outfit and textiles could be recolored for different events in the same day,\" they write.\n\nThey hope to eventually combine the technology with 3D printing.", "description": "Using 3D modelling the researchers projected designs onto various objects, which can be erased and re-designed at will.", "authors": ["Isobel Asher Hamilton"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7a25622e22af0cc40e0536-1536-768.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
