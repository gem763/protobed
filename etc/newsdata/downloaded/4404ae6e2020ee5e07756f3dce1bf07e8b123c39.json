Photo: CBS Photo Archive/Getty Images\n\nShaving can be very hard on your skin, and razor bumps can be enough to tempt even the most adamant daily shavers into growing a beard. According to dermatologist Samer Jaber of Washington Square Dermatology, when we talk about razor bumps, we\u2019re actually talking about ingrown hairs (whose technical term is pseudofolliculitis barbae). As Jaber explains, razor bumps occur when hair essentially grows back into the skin, often triggering an anti-inflammatory reaction which results tiny bumps that can be red and painful. Razor bumps can occur anywhere on the body where you shave, but they\u2019re particularly an issue when men shave their faces, since beard hair tends to be coarser and curlier than hair on other parts of the body. \u201cThick curly hair is more prone to that inward turning,\u201d explains Jaber, but razor bumps can be an issue no matter your facial-hair type. To find the best things for getting rid of razor bumps when they form, we turned to Jaber and eight other experts. And although a few of them say that the best way to get rid of razor bumps is to \u201cgrow a beard,\u201d that isn\u2019t an option for everyone. Thankfully, there are plenty of face scrubs, aftershaves, and spot treatments you can also use, all of which the pros say are actually quite effective.\n\nBest overall way to get rid of razor bumps\n\nAnthony Glycolic Facial Cleanser $24 (was $28, now 14% off) Four of the experts we spoke with said using an exfoliating scrub is best way to get rid of razor bumps and ingrown hairs. According to Chad Beightol, the owner of grooming store Consigliere, \u201cingrown hairs are complicated by the buildup of skin, so you want to focus on removing the dead skin cells. This can be accomplished by a chemical alpha-hydroxy exfoliant like glycolic acid or lactic acid.\u201d The key to choosing a good facial scrub is finding something that is effective but still gentle enough not to make things worse, which is why Jaber also recommends products with glycolic acid, because he says it\u2019s \u201cgood for gentle exfoliation.\u201d Beightol agrees, recommending this glycolic facial cleanser from Anthony. It also contains cetyl alcohol, which is one of the key ingredients master barber and education lead at The Shave Barber Company in Atlanta, David Rodriguez, told us to look for. According to Rodriguez, cetyl alcohol is a \u201cfatty alcohol, so it still has the effect of contracting the skin,\u201d but it\u2019s less irritating than other alcohols. $24 at Amazon Buy $24 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest (less expensive) exfoliant for getting rid of razor bumps\n\nMagic Shave Bump Rescue Exfoliating Cleanser (Pack of 2) Echoing Beightol, David Rodriguez says the main cause of ingrown hairs is the buildup of dead skin over the hair follicle. His favorite gentle exfoliant for \u201cremoving the dead skin\u201d is this Magic Bump Off scrub, which is formulated with charcoal. As Rodriguez explains, \u201ccharcoal has a detoxifying effect, it helps soak up impurities.\u201d He\u2019s a fan of the whole line of Magic products, but he particularly likes the scrub and told us he thinks it\u2019s the best all-purpose treatment for most people. If you have some razor bumps on your face or neck, he recommends using this a day before shaving to prepare the skin. It also lists salicylic acid as an active ingredient, which Jaber says has \u201cantibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects.\u201d $15 at Amazon Buy $15 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest plant-based exfoliant for getting rid of razor bumps\n\nFresh Soy Face Exfoliant Barber Dreux Martinez of Urbane Blades in Chicago says that if you have sensitive skin and are dealing with ingrown hairs and razor bumps, it\u2019s a good idea to look for for \u201cplant-based\u201d products, because harsher chemicals can often \u201cmake things worse.\u201d He says Fresh\u2019s exfoliant is one of the \u201cbest I\u2019ve found,\u201d noting that the soy is \u201cvery gentle.\u201d $43 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nBest cream spot treatment for getting rid of razor bumps\n\nCortizone 1% Hydrocortisone Creme $6 (was $11, now 45% off) If you want to target razor bumps more directly, a spot treatment might be a better option than a scrub, according to Jaber and David Rodriguez, who both recommend a low-concentration hydrocortisone cream. Jaber told us that a 1-percent hydrocortisone cream like this \u201cwill make the redness and inflammation go down\u201d on most standard-issue bumps. But if you\u2019re dealing with an ingrown hair that\u2019s extremely painful, he recommends seeing a dermatologist and considering a steroid injection. $6 at Amazon Buy $6 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest liquid spot treatment for getting rid of razor bumps\n\nTend Skin Solution For those who don\u2019t want to use a cream, Ron Jones of Pall Mall Barbers in New York City and Xavier Rodriguez of Fellow Barber Soho both suggest using an isopropyl-alcohol-based liquid solution like Tend Skin as another spot treatment. It\u2019s highly concentrated, so Jones cautions to use it sparingly, but he says it can be a very effective treatment. \u201cBacteria forms when hair re-penetrates the skin and goes back in,\u201d he explains, and alcohol-based solutions can \u201cdry out and dissolve\u201d that bacteria. Jones does warn that alcohol can also \u201cdry out your skin if overused,\u201d but he says that if you want something that \u201cworks fast,\u201d it\u2019s worth considering something like this. \u201cI can put it on in the morning and by the next evening my face will be smooth,\u201d he says. $22 at Amazon Buy $16 at Ulta Beauty Buy\n\nBest liquid spot treatment for getting rid of razor bumps on sensitive skin\n\nThayers Alcohol-Free Unscented Witch Hazel Toner According to Jaber, Tend Skin \u201cworks great for some people, but others might find it really irritating.\u201d If you\u2019ve got more sensitive skin, he recommends using an alcohol-free witch hazel solution like this, which he describes as \u201ca more gentle alternative to Tend Skin\u201d and similar products. It\u2019s not going to be quite as potent, but it\u2019s easier on the skin and less drying, and Jaber says it still has \u201cantiseptic\u201d qualities. David Rodriguez is a fan or witch hazel, too, and suggests it for people who prefer \u201call-natural\u201d treatment because \u201cwitch hazel is a natural anti-inflammatory.\u201d He adds that the best way to apply is to \u201cpat it on\u201d with cotton ball or something similar (you would apply Tend Skin in the same way). \u201cNever rub it in because then you\u2019re aggravating [your skin],\u201d explains Rodriguez. $9 at Amazon Buy $9 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest aftershave cream for getting rid of razor bumps\n\nLucky Tiger Vanishing Cream $10 (was $11, now 9% off) Some of the experts also recommend treatments that are intended to be applied after shaving, when the skin on your face is the most sensitive and prone to developing razor bumps and ingrown hairs. These aftershaves help prevent razor bumps from occurring in the first place, according to the pros, and they can also help get rid of any existing bumps or irritation. Owner of Independence Barber Co., Heather Manto, and Anthony Michael Tapia, master barber at New York City\u2019s Barbiere, both recommended Lucky Tiger\u2019s \u201cvanishing cream\u201d as an aftershave lotion for getting rid of razor bumps. Manto says she prefers this to more traditional aftershaves, and she uses it on clients after straight-razor shaves. \u201cIt gives the menthol tingle but nourishes the skin instead of drying it out.\u201d Tapia adds, \u201cit\u2019s really good for treating irritation and razor bumps. This product is 100-percent legit.\u201d $10 at Amazon Buy $10 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest aftershave serum for getting rid of razor bumps\n\nBump Patrol Original Formula Aftershave Serum If you prefer a facial serum over a cream, Xavier Rodriguez recommends this aftershave from Bump Patrol. It\u2019s meant to be applied post-shave, and it\u2019s designed specifically to clear up razor bumps and ingrown hairs, he says. $12 at Amazon Buy $12 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest exfoliating brush for getting rid of razor bumps\n\nThe Art of Shaving Power Brush and Pre-Shave Gel Set Those open to a less conventional approach to getting rid of razor bumps might consider Art of Shaving\u2019s \u201cpower brush,\u201d which came recommended by barber Angelo Ruscetta of American Haircuts in Kennesaw, Georgia. He says that this electronic, vibrating brush is great for ingrown hairs \u201cbecause it exfoliates and softens the skin to let the hair naturally break through.\u201d According to the company, you can use it to prepare your skin before a shave, or can use it on its own, independent of shaving. You apply the included shave gel to your face and then run the power brush over it for about a minute. Then you can layer your regular shaving cream on top and shave, or you could simply rinse the gel residue off with water and call it a day. $65 at The Art of Shaving Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
