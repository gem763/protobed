Sure, you\u2019d like to pay less in taxes and not have to comply with costly regulations. But you also want to invest in your company\u2019s future. And to do that, you need some assurance that the rules of the game will be stable, so that whatever investments you make now aren\u2019t suddenly made worthless by future shifts in policy.\n\n[For an even deeper look at what\u2019s on Paul Krugman\u2019s mind, sign up for his weekly newsletter.]\n\nThe big complaint business has about Trump\u2019s trade war isn\u2019t just that tariffs raise costs and prices, while foreign retaliation is cutting off access to important markets. It is that businesses can\u2019t make plans when policy zigzags in response to the president\u2019s whims. They don\u2019t want to invest in anything that relies on a global supply chain, because that supply chain might unravel with Trump\u2019s next tweet. But they can\u2019t invest on the assumption that Trump\u2019s tariffs will be permanent, either; you never know when or whether he\u2019ll declare victory and surrender.\n\nEnvironmental policy, it turns out, is similar. Business leaders aren\u2019t do-gooders, but they are realists. Most of them understand that climate change is happening, that it\u2019s dangerous, and that we\u2019ll eventually have to transition to a low-emissions economy. They want to spend now to secure their place in that future economy; they know that investments that worsen climate change are bound to be long-run losers. But they\u2019ll hold off on investing in our energy future as long as conspiracy theorists who consider global warming a gigantic hoax \u2014 and/or vindictive politicians determined to erase Obama\u2019s achievements \u2014 keep rewriting the rules.\n\nTo be fair, however, some kinds of business do thrive under Trumpism \u2014 namely, businesses that aren\u2019t in it for the long run, operations whose strategy is to take the money and run. These are good times for mining companies that rush in to extract whatever they can, leaving a poisoned landscape behind; for real estate speculators sponsoring dubious ventures that take advantage of newly created tax loopholes; for for-profit colleges that leave their students with worthless degrees and crippling debt.\n\nIn other words, under Trump it\u2019s springtime for grifters.\n\nBut to say the obvious, these smash-and-grab operations aren\u2019t the kinds of business we want to thrive. Put it this way: Remaking the U.S. economy in the image of Trump University isn\u2019t exactly making America great again.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
