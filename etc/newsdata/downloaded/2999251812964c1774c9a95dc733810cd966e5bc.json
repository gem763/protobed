(Photo by Leon Bennett/Getty Images)\n\nLos Angeles Sparks general manager Penny Toler has been fired only a day after a report emerged that she used the n-word during an ill-advised attempt to pump up her team after a loss in the WNBA playoffs, the team announced Friday.\n\nThe Sparks\u2019 press release announcing Toler\u2019s firing does not mention the report.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u201cOn behalf of ownership and the entire Sparks organization, I\u2019d like to thank Penny Toler for a successful and historic tenure with the organization,\u201d Sparks governor Eric Holoman said in the release. \u201cPenny is a foundational figure in the growth of the WNBA and helped lead our franchise to perennial playoff success and multiple titles. We wish her nothing but the best moving forward.\u201d\n\nToler\u2019s firing ends a 20-year tenure in Los Angeles in which the Sparks won three WNBA titles and made the playoffs in all but two seasons. She was both the longest-tenured and winningest general manager in league history. Prior to her tenure as general manager, Toler played three seasons for the Sparks and holds the interesting distinction of scoring the first basket in WNBA history.\n\nToler used N-word in \u2018spirited\u2019 postgame speech\n\nFollowing the Sparks\u2019 humiliating 94-68 loss in Game 2 of a series they would later lost to the Connecticut Sun, Toler reportedly spoke to players in the locker room and used \u201cracial epithets\u201d in a speech meant to motivate them while down 2-0 to the Sun.\n\nShe later confirmed to ESPN she used the N-word, but in a context that wasn\u2019t directed at her players.\n\nToler\u2019s defense, from ESPN:\n\nStory continues\n\n\"By no means did I call my players the N-word. I'm not saying that I couldn't have used it in a context. But it wasn't directed at any of my players. \"It's unfortunate I used that word. I shouldn't. Nobody should. ... But you know, like I said, I'm not here to defend word by word by word what I said. I know some of the words that I'm being accused of are embellished. Did I give a speech that I hoped would get our team going? Yes. \"I think that this whole conversation has been taken out of context because when we lose, emotions are running high and, unfortunately and obviously, some people feel some type of way.\"\n\nToler also reportedly noted it was the first such incident in her two-decade career as general manager and said it \u201cclearly is not the reason we lost game 3.\u201d She added that she didn\u2019t mean to offend and was \u201csaying what I was thinking. And I have the right to do that as the GM.\n\nMultiple players also reportedly told ESPN that Toler called them \u201cmotherf---ers\u201d and threatened to replace them if the Sparks were swept, which later happened. Instead, it is Toler who will be replaced.\n\nWhat about Derek Fisher?\n\nToler\u2019s racial slurs only came after what was a rocky postseason for the Sparks. Head coach Derek Fisher, a questionable hire by Toler last offseason, oversaw a team that was severely outmatched by the Sun.\n\nFisher was widely criticized for benching star Candace Parker in the Sparks\u2019 must-win Game 3. ESPN commentator Rebecca Lobo also questioned him for appearing to only tell his players that they need to play harder during a 78-56 Game 3 loss, rather than any tactical changes.\n\nGiven that Fisher was Toler\u2019s hire, you\u2019d think he could be headed out the door as well. However, ESPN reports Fisher is expected to keep his job.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Penny Toler's tenure as Sparks general manager is ending after 20 seasons and three WNBA titles.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Be4AXJmk.VUwredERKJYTA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JppvigpxitIYXdH7THXJKQ--~B/aD0zMDcyO3c9NDYwODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/23025e50-e60a-11e9-97df-b0c31991dc1d", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
