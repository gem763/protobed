More than 200 flights were canceled into and out of Orlando International Airport and another 160 were canceled into and out of Fort Lauderdale.\n\nAmtrak canceled some southeast service through Tuesday, including some trains between Miami and New York City and auto trains between Sanford, Fla. and Lorton, Va.\n\nOn Sunday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) suspended tolls on some highways, including the Florida Turnpike and Alligator Alley, to speed evacuations, as state highway crews buttoned up construction sites by removing or securing orange barrels and temporary signs.\n\n[Historic Hurricane Dorian takes aim at Southeastern U.S.]\n\nAs of Sunday afternoon, computer models showed the storm shifting closer to the coast compared to Saturday and moving toward Florida and the Southeast United States, including coastal Georgia and the Carolinas. Forecasters expect it to hit by midweek, but the exact track remains uncertain.\n\nThe hurricane\u2019s unknown path has left transportation officials guessing.\n\nOrlando International Airport announced Friday afternoon that it would cease flights starting at 2 a.m. Labor Day \u201cout of an abundance of caution.\u201d It then announced Saturday evening that, based on the hurricane\u2019s changing path, it would remain open.\n\n\u201cOriginal storm forecasts reported the hurricane could have greatly impacted Orlando International and the entire Central Florida region,\u201d the airport said in a statement. \u201cThe latest updates show that Hurricane Dorian has changed its path and has proven to be an unpredictable storm.\u201d\n\nHurricane #Dorian Statement - 8/31/19 Evening\n\n\n\nOrlando International Airport will continue with operations on Monday, September 2.\n\n\n\nThe latest update will always be pinned to top of our page.

The airport cautioned passengers on Twitter: \u201cRemember, the airport is not a shelter.\u201d\n\nBoth airports advised passengers to check with their airlines.\n\nSouthwest Airlines warned of delays and possible cancellations for flights in and out of six Florida cities and the Bahamas through Thursday and Charleston through Friday.\n\nAmerican Airlines said it would waive change and cancellation fees for certain Florida cities for flights through Wednesday if passengers met certain requirements. The same applies for American flights into and out of the Bahamas through Monday. Some airlines, such as Southwest, are also waiving pet fees for small dogs and cats traveling to and from Florida cities and Charleston.\n\n\n\nPeople walk out of a grocery store ahead of the arrival of Hurricane Dorian in Titusville, Fla., Sept. 1, 2019.

Those with canceled flights can request refunds, the airline said on its website.\n\nPublic officials also focused on ensuring gasoline supplies, even as some pumps ran dry by Sunday, as motorists fueled up ahead of the storm.\n\nIn Georgia, Gov. Brian Kemp (R) issued an executive order temporarily suspending federal rules limiting the hours that commercial truck drivers can drive to ensure an \u201cuninterrupted supply\u201d of gasoline, emergency supplies and food, according to the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency.\n\n[Incredible views of Category 5 Hurricane Dorian near peak intensity]", "description": "Travelers should check with their airlines before heading to the airport.
