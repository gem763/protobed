The flame of brattiness no longer flickers in their sound: Nine has no joke songs, no sex songs, and no homoerotic hijinks. What it does offer is a bumper crop of high-grade, ultra-processed, huff-it-and-grin punk singalongs that find a middle place between re-creating the TRL days and nodding to what works on radio now.\n\nThe first blast of feeling that the album delivers is, in fact, nostalgic. \u201cThe First Time\u201d flames out of the speakers with a two-chord riff as rocket fuel, and the chorus offers a lovely reminder of Blink\u2019s almost-Gregorian ear for arranging vocals. Skiba and Mark Hoppus harmonize in rounds about highs and hangovers, but the effect is more like that of listening to \u201cCarol of the Bells,\u201d which was also the effect of the chorus of \u201cAll the Small Things.\u201d Indeed, the tones and tricks used across the album are so recognizably from the Blink playbook that Nine will get the band\u2019s old hits stuck in the listener\u2019s head along with the new material.\n\nBut the band members do push to territory that\u2019s new to them, even if it\u2019s not really new to their contemporaries: \u201cDarkside\u201d jitters with Killers-style disco choruses; \u201cBlame It on My Youth\u201d has a military-march lurch familiar to Imagine Dragons; and the depressed-kindergartner melody of \u201cReally Wish I Hated You\u201d recalls the songwriting of Spotify-friendly divas such as Halsey. These may not sound like the coolest reference points, and pro producer-songwriters including John Feldmann and The Futuristics buff every bass line and call-and-response vocal until it gleams like a brand-new lip ring. Yet Blink in their heyday were always pop par excellence, and accusing them of selling out is ridiculous. There\u2019s a frenetic, Blink-y energy throughout in Hoppus\u2019s pseudo-naive singing style and the crazed, mercurial drumming of Travis Barker.\n\nListen through the 15 tracks, in fact, and the whole of this band\u2019s often-silly-seeming career gains a certain improbable seriousness. Blink-182\u2019s great strength all along has been in nailing the emotional ambivalence that comes between the sugary highs, heard in the band\u2019s old meditative standouts like \u201cAdam\u2019s Song\u201d or \u201cStay Together for the Kids.\u201d By 2019, they\u2019re able to apply that highly specific bummer\u2014feeling on the precipice of losing something forever\u2014to grown-up burnout, like on \u201cHappy Days,\u201d a searching diagnosis of how it feels \u201cwhen enough doesn\u2019t cut it.\u201d Touring with Lil Wayne and revisiting Enema of the State creates the impression of kegger-party clowns who never evolved. But they shouldn\u2019t have to run from sobering up and being \u201cOn Some Emo Shit\u201d\u2014that\u2019s one of Nine\u2019s song titles\u2014when the results are this catchy.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
