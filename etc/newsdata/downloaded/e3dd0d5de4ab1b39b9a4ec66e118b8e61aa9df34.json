Smart, who was sentenced to life in prison maintains her innocence.\n\nWhen Moriarty sees Smart, the inmate is wearing pink sneakers and lots of gold jewelry. Not a blonde hair is out of place. \"I still try to keep my girly self up. You know, I mean, I try because I feel like if I don't care about the outside, I'm not going to care about the inside anymore,\" Smart tells Moriarty.\n\n\"I don't want to die here. No, I don't,\" Smart says. \"And I would like to be able to go home and take care of my parents, to live a life. I have dreams and aspirations for myself. But, mainly, I wanna be able to be with my family. I've been away from them for so long.\"\n\nSmart opens up about her case, her time in prison, and being attacked when she first arrived at Bedford Hills.\n\nShe says the songwriting class is a way to get away from being Pamela Smart. \"It's an escape from this place, more so than an escape from the garbage that goes around myself, my name, and all of that,\" Smart says. \"It's more of an escape from the drudgery of incarceration, you know, and day-to-day routine, that can be stifling and very oppressive all the time.\"\n\n\"My Life of Crime\" is a new podcast from the producers of \"48 Hours,\" America's true crime destination. The series is quickly resonating with listeners as they go along with Moriarty for her immersive, intimate and sometimes irreverent take on true crime stories. Some are infamous \u2014 some are little known \u2014 but all include Moriarty's signature reporting.", "description": "\"48 Hours\" correspondent Erin Moriarty visits the songwriting workshop at the maximum security women's prison in Bedford Hills, New York", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/18/6094a04a-8a9f-4fd8-bb44-2bc3f80b6fdd/thumbnail/1200x630/2f7fe8cdc5c549ba190f10c81f6e6847/my-life-of-crime-920x460.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
