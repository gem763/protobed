Trump previewed it in his tweets this morning defending his decision to block Gordon Sondland from testifying. The White House has decided that it\u2019s done cooperating with the House\u2019s impeachment probe \u2014 and not for any traditional legal reason, really, like executive privilege, although White House counsel Pat Cipollone does include that in his list of grievances in this eight-page rant. It\u2019s done cooperating because, it says, the probe is simply too unfair. It\u2019s too secretive, it\u2019s too one-sided, it hasn\u2019t been properly authorized via a formal House vote. Trump\u2019s not getting due process, Cipollone argues, therefore the White House is no longer required to comply with subpoenas or make anyone available to testify.\n\nCoincidentally, they\u2019ve arrived at this decision at the very moment that Sondland, a firsthand witness who once allegedly told Ron Johnson that there was a quid pro quo happening with Ukraine, was about to talk.\n\nYou can read the whole thing here. Most of it resembles a talk-radio monologue, not a letter from the White House counsel, which is befitting of its true nature. This is a PR document aimed to rally righties around Trump as he goes about obstructing the probe, not something for Democratic lawyers to mull over. Cipollone dispenses with the legal claims in Section I, which runs only a few pages. Here\u2019s the bottom line:\n\nAnd again a bit later:\n\nWhat this is, in other words, is a constitutional crisis pitting the House\u2019s authority to pursue impeachment of the president against a variety of claims by the White House \u2014 due process, for starters, and executive privilege secondarily. It\u2019s highly likely that House Democrats would win that battle if it went to court, that judges would decide that the House has broad discretion in how to conduct impeachment proceedings and that the issue is generally nonjusticiable. The alternative, a win for Trump, would grant future presidents the power to short-circuit any impeachment proceeding by identifying alleged unfairness and using that as a pretext to withhold evidence. Probably a court will say that Sondland should testify and the White House should turn over requested materials and then plead its case about fairness to the two juries in impeachment \u2014 the Senate, first and foremost, and the electorate more generally. It\u2019ll be especially hard for Cipollone to convince a court to side with the White House, I think, given that the Senate is controlled by the president\u2019s own party. If Trump were at risk of being railroaded by a Democratic-controlled Congress, that might give a judge pause, As it is, everything in this letter can and will be cited by Republican senators as reasons to acquit Trump once the matter reaches them.\n\nSome critics of the letter this evening are predictable\u2026\n\nThis letter, in and of itself, is an impeachable offense. \u2014 George Conway (@gtconway3d) October 8, 2019\n\n\u2026others are marginally more interesting:\n\nWow. This letter is bananas. A barely-lawyered temper tantrum. A middle finger to Congress and its oversight responsibilities. No Member of Congress should accept it, no matter his or her view on the behavior of Pelosi, Schiff, or Trump. Things are bad. Things will get worse. https://t.co/AesJ6cGHrl \u2014 Gregg Nunziata (@greggnunziata) October 8, 2019\n\nNunziata used to be Marco Rubio\u2019s counsel. As for what Democrats do now, in a sense it doesn\u2019t matter: Trump knows he\u2019s getting impeached one way or another so he\u2019s seizing the opportunity here to put some meat on the bone for his \u201cwitch hunt\u201d defense once it happens. Having Cipollone do it instead of the White House comms department is smart too since it gives him some (self-serving) legal authority for the claim. It\u2019s not just Trump who says it\u2019s a witch hunt, it\u2019s his own extremely well-respected attorney!\n\nPelosi\u2019s going to have to make a choice and it comes down to this.\n\n1. Impeach Trump for obstruction immediately. She\u2019d rather not do that since it would take the focus off his Ukraine behavior and turn public opinion into a referendum on whether the impeachment process was fair or not. At a minimum, if Dems go this route, they\u2019ll impeach him for obstruction *and* for making the Biden request to Zelensky, irrespective of whether there was a quid pro quo. The advantage of impeaching him ASAP is that it\u2019ll save time, as Pelosi doesn\u2019t want the process dragging on for months so that Republicans can argue that voters should settle it at the ballot box instead.\n\n2. Start holding people in contempt and fight Trump on that point first. Some Trump cronies are practically begging her to do so:\n\nGiuliani tells me he won't testify or give documents to impeachment hearings being led by Schiff & would welcome legal fight over contempt. Others won't cooperate either, he says. \"The position I'm stating now is the position of the administration.\" https://t.co/koifkuDDSe \u2014 Josh Dawsey (@jdawsey1) October 8, 2019\n\nDoes Rudy think he has a free-floating privilege not to cooperate with Democrat-run probes? He\u2019s not a member of the administration so he can\u2019t rightly claim executive privilege. His work for Trump in Ukraine appears to have been diplomatic, not legal, so there\u2019s no attorney/client privilege. If Giuliani won\u2019t cough up documents, Pelosi may have to hold him in contempt. Same goes for Sondland if he won\u2019t testify. Dems might even consider the nuclear option of \u201cinherent contempt,\u201d in which they impose their own sanctions on uncooperative witnesses without court help (up to and including imprisonment). But an aggressive offensive involving contempt risks bolstering Trump\u2019s claim that Democrats have resorted to dubious procedures to prosecute their vendetta against him. If Trump is running around telling voters that Pelosi has gone crazy with Trump-hatred, what are they going to conclude if she has Rudy Giuliani thrown in the congressional brig or whatever? Trump was right!\n\nThe other problem with contempt is that it\u2019ll be challenged in court and that could drag out for much longer than Pelosi wants. There\u2019s an upside to it too, of course: Nothing would validate the impeachment inquiry in the public\u2019s eyes like having a court, especially the Supreme Court, side with Democrats on the constitutional dispute. But there\u2019s no telling if the courts will review the matter urgently because of its national significance. And of course Pelosi\u2019s taking a big risk counting on a conservative-leaning SCOTUS to side with her against Trump. I think it\u2019s worth the risk to her to go this route, though, knowing that John Roberts is highly unlikely to join a 5-4 party-line vote in Trump\u2019s favor given his worries about perceptions of the Court\u2019s independence. And a favorable SCOTUS ruling for Dems might be the only thing that can really damage Trump\u2019s and Cipollone\u2019s claim that this is a procedural fiasco. Winning a court battle will give the inquiry legitimacy.
