However, Mrs Graves' side effect is considered 'very rare'.\n\nLisa Graves, 31, of Lincoln, has hiccupped up to 100 times a day since her first pregnancy in 2008. She has finally been told by doctors the cause was most likely a stroke\n\nThe nail technician tried everything to stop the annoying disruptions, from sucking a lemon, being 'jumped' and a spoon of sugar\n\nMrs Graves said: 'Knowing what happened to me during my pregnancy for no reason, I'm lucky. It could have been a lot worse.\n\n'I was surprised to learn that I\u2019d had a stroke during pregnancy \u2013 and never once thought it could be the cause of my hiccups.\n\n'I\u2019d never heard of a condition like mine before.\n\n'I initially tried every hiccup remedy in the book - people making me jump, sucking on a lemon, literally everything. But nothing worked.'\n\nMrs Graves' hiccups are random and may be 20 in an hour or none at all. They vary in volume, she said.\n\nFizzy drinks and alcohol can exacerbate the condition.\n\nMrs Graves has visited numerous doctors over the years, despite initially putting off having tests because she was terrified of being told she had a brain tumour.\n\nShe also considered she had a tic or behavioural problem.\n\nBouts of hiccups that last longer than 48 hours are known as persistent hiccups and rare cases which go on for more than a month are referred to as intractable hiccups.\n\nGPs can prescribe medications which relax the diaphragm muscle or its nerve supply.\n\nBut Mrs Graves refused medication, offered to her when neurologists figured out the cause.\n\nIt is not clear what drugs she has been offered. However, chlorpromazine or haloperidol, typically used as anti-phsychotics but also for the treatment of prolonged hiccups, can cause dizziness, drowsiness and trouble sleeping.\n\nMrs Graves said: 'I decided to not go down the medicated route. I didn't want to be dependent on them.\n\n'The medication offered is used for multiple illnesses and therefore has a lot of side effects. There was no guarantee it would work, and it was manageable.'\n\nMrs Graves has grown used to her unusual condition, but others have described her hiccups like the sound of a dog being stood on, a chicken and a dinosaur.\n\nWhilst her engineer husband, Matthew, 35, and daughters Emily and Sophie, seven, barely bat an eyelid, Mrs Graves' colleagues are still taken by surprise.\n\nMrs Graves' hiccups are random and may be 20 in an hour or none at all.

However, she still struggles to cope with her hiccups in public because they can be embarrassing. She is pictured hiccuping at work\n\nCAN A STROKE CAUSE HICCUPS? Conditions that affect the central nervous system (CNS), including stroke, traumatic brain injury, encephalitis or a brain tumour, have been linked to the onset of hiccups. Prolonged hiccups last a month or more, and any bout that continues over two months is known as intractable hiccups. Hiccups are an involuntarily spasm of the diaphragm, which is under the rib cage, followed by a sudden intake of air with a closure of the glottis - the part of the larynx consisting of the vocal cords and the opening between them. The abrupt air rush into lungs makes the 'hic' sound. A set of certain nerves in the body -such as the peripheral phrenic pathway - is likely responsible for hiccup, scientists say. The central midbrain, a part of the central nervous system associated with vision, hearing, motor control, and temperature regulation, is also understood to play a role. An irritant, such as a tumour, could invade the 'reflex arc' of nerves involved in a hiccup, triggering them. Similarly, impact on the central midbrain, due to stroke, could cause them. Stroke can have a lasting impact by effecting speech, swallowing, bladder or bowel control and co-ordination to name a few. Treatment of chronic hiccups involve various drugs that may treat an underlying condition of block nerves.\n\nShe said: 'For my two daughters, I've hiccupped their entire lives so it doesn't bother them.\n\n'It can wake me up in the night, and sometimes my husband too, but it's only a minor inconvenience.\n\n'I'm lucky - I own my salon and the majority of the girls that I work with have grown used to it.\n\n'But I can still make them jump, and there's been plenty of mishaps when we're working on nails - with a wild stroke of the brush here and there.'\n\nMrs Graves can find the condition hard to manage, often feeling the need to explain and pre-warn people.\n\nShe said: 'Sometimes I do go on work courses and meals out with the family, things like that and they can be hard.\n\n'I feel like I have to let people know what might happen - it's a loud noise, and it can be embarrassing.\n\n'I think I'm likely to be hiccupping till my grave - but it's become part of me now.'\n\nThe longest period of hiccupping on record, according to The British Society of Gastroenterology, is 68 years.\n\nThe record-holder, Charles Osborne, of Anthon, Iowa, started hiccupping in 1922 and continued hiccupping until February 1990, the year before his death.\n\nAccording to Mrs Graves, the involuntary contraction of her diaphragm now happens most when she's comfortable and relaxed.\n\nShe said: 'For everyone who knows me know, it's just a way of life, just who I am.\n\n'I can hiccup in the middle of a conversation, and it can be loud - most people say it sounds like a dog being stood on, although I've recently people say it sounds a bit like a chicken too.\n\n'Now though, I've grown used to it.\n\n'There was a time when I'd feel quite embarrassed about it, and would put off going out in public, but now, I just get on with it.'\n\nPregnancy and the postpartum period have an increased risk of ischemic stroke, which is when a blood clot blocks blood supply to the brain.\n\nIncidence estimates have varies between nine to 34 strokes per 100,000 deliveries worldwide.\n\nNormally a stroke causes symptoms - drooping face, slurred speech or paralysis of muscles.\n\nBut sometimes a 'silent stroke' doesn't have typical symptoms and a person might forget subtle signs even occurred.", "description": "Lisa Graves, of Lincoln, has hiccupped up to 100 times a day since 2008.
