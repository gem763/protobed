His family call him Al, and frankly, I don\u2019t see why we should call him Boris either. It plays into this notion that he is a jolly, gentle, teddy bear of a character. While I\u2019d be first to acknowledge his wit, it may be he is not such a nice piece of work after all. Even if he is, it is of course inappropriate to indulge any politician in this way (just as we do not use the sobriquet Jeremy or Jezza for the leader of the opposition).\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIt is also unusual. Margaret Thatcher used to get the same spin from the tabloids closest to her \u2013 \u201cBattling Maggie\u201d (referring to dealing with Europe) or \u201cMaggie Flies In\u201d or \u201cMaggie and Ronnie Love In at Camp David\u201d (that\u2019s a reference to President Ronald Reagan).\n\nIn the early, glory years of Theresa May her cronies in the press used to call her \u201cTheresa\u201d, or, laughably as it turned out in this headline, \u201cSteel of the New Iron Lady\u201d. It didn\u2019t last. All the rest \u2013 Cameron, Brown, Blair, Major, Callaghan, and Wilson \u2013 had to make do with surnames. Harold Macmillan was called \u201cSupermac\u201d by the cartoonist Victor \u201cVicky\u201d Weisz, and it was meant to be sarcastic; instead, it stuck, and enhanced his reputation.\n\nI find it a bit odd that the Daily Mirror, not a natural friend of Mr Johnson should term him \u201cBoris\u201d, but then they often qualify it rather unhelpfully, as I noticed yesterday \u2013 \u201cLiar Boris is like a dodgy estate agent, says ex-PM\u201d (meaning John Major). Thus, \u201cBoris\u201d could become a less cuddly pet name.\n\nI cannot but admire my colleagues on the Evening Standard who came up with this front-page headline after the prime minister\u2019s brother Jo resigned from the government: \u201cBlow for Bojo as bro Jo go goes\u201d. Maybe it contravened the style guide, but, as Johnson so often reminds, us, rules are there to be broken.\n\nYours,\n\nSean O\u2019Grady\n\nAssociate editor", "description": "Well, what shall we call him?
