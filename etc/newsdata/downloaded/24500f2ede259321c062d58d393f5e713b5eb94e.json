Mark Amodei of Nevada kicked up a firestorm last Friday when he appeared to become the first Republican to back an impeachment probe. Amodei later clarified that he doesn\u2019t support impeachment and was merely voicing support for the oversight process, but the messy episode sparked concern in the GOP conference that members weren\u2019t being given adequate guidance on how to deal with the rapidly unfolding impeachment probe, according to one member who brought those concerns to leadership.\n\nWhile no one brought up Amodei during Monday\u2019s call, members raised other messaging challenges, according to the members and aides on the call.\n\n\u201cWe need to help members with how to deal with this, because it\u2019s not going to get any easier,\u201d the Republican lawmaker said.\n\nAnd during a high-profile interview with CBS\u2019s \u201c60 minutes,\u201d McCarthy \u2014 a top Trump ally \u2014 initially struggled to answer a question about what the president\u2019s defense will be on impeachment, causing some grumbling among Republican lawmakers and aides. McCarthy did, however, drive home the point that there was no evidence of wrongdoing in the call.\n\n\u201cTelevision appearances are not McCarthy\u2019s strong suit,\u201d said one rank-and-file GOP lawmaker, who was granted anonymity to speak more freely.\n\nImmediately after a rough transcript of the call was released, the GOP seized on the fact that there was no explicit mention of the foreign aid to Ukraine that was being held up at the time.\n\nBut the messaging missteps aren\u2019t limited to Capitol Hill. The White House, which hasn\u2019t set up an impeachment war room, accidentally sent a list of talking points to Democratic offices on Capitol Hill last week.\n\nAnd Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani has given a string of combative and bizarre TV interviews, which some Republicans say are actually hurting Trump \u2014 and Democrats even cited some of those TV appearances in their subpoena for Ukraine documents.\n\nPart of the challenge for Republicans is that Democrats are moving forward quickly with their impeachment probe, even working over the two-week recess. And new damning details about Trump\u2019s communications with foreign leaders kept popping up over the weekend, forcing Republicans to play whack-a-mole and complicating their messaging strategy just ahead of the Sunday news shows where a number of GOP lawmakers and White House officials struggled to defend the president.\n\nSome Republicans, however, say they need to be equipped with more than just talking points. They want GOP leaders to tap a group of members from the relevant investigative committees to lead Trump\u2019s defense strategy on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cTalking points never work. A strategy with real substance and real facts is always better,\u201d the rank-and-file Republican said.\n\nJohn Bresnahan contributed to this story.", "description": "Republicans have had trouble communicating a defense amid the fast-moving probe.", "authors": ["Melanie Zanona"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/b5/65/f131e1374bb9859b85c044ad6cab/20190930-mccarthy-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
