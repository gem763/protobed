But it wasn't his problem.\n\nHe was a \"head in the ground investigator\". His job was to solve murders, not make judgment calls about legal representation for a man accused of murder, the senior and still-serving officer said.\n\n\"I don't regard it as the responsibility of a police investigator to seek to navigate on behalf of a barrister where his or her conflict might arise and how best it be dealt with,\" he said.\n\nInsp Buick went even further, adding that police may even seek to redact discussions officers had with the lawyer to prevent the client ever knowing about their earlier involvement.\n\n\"It doesn't seem a realistic scenario,\" he added, despite it being exactly what occurred with Ms Gobbo.\n\nAfter court proceedings the following year Ms Gobbo thanked senior gangland-busting Purana Taskforce investigator Stuart Bateson for keeping her name out of it.\n\nInsp Buick, a qualified lawyer, told the inquiry that if knew Ms Gobbo had been deliberately withholding her involvement with the witness from her new client he might report it, but he wouldn't have gone directly to the client.", "description": "Victoria's turncoat underworld lawyer Nicola Gobbo's conflicts of interests were immense.In 2004 she represented a Melbourne gangland hitman turned police...", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
