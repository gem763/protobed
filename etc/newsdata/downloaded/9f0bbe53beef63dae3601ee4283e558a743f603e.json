Marcus Rashford struck a free kick from 30 yards that dipped high into the net to clinch a 2-1 win for Manchester United against Chelsea after the striker\u2019s first-half penalty had been canceled out by Michy Batshuayi.\n\nAston Villa also advanced on Wednesday after Anwar El Ghazi and Ahmed Elmohamady scored in a 2-1 victory over Wolverhampton.\n\nHolder Manchester City, Everton and Leicester joined lower-league sides Colchester and Oxford in reaching the quarterfinals on Tuesday.\n\nANFIELD FRENZY\n\nOn only his third appearance of the season, Mesut \u00d6zil provided a reminder of his abilities as he had a hand in three of Arsenal\u2019s goals.\n\nHowever, he was taken off just past the hour with Liverpool in the ascendancy having twice fought back from two-goal deficits to level at 4-4.\n\nThe first goal of the night came after six minutes when Arsenal defender Shkodran Mustafi diverted the ball into his own net after coming under pressure from Rhian Brewster after Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain\u2019s cross came into the penalty area.\n\nArsenal drew level in the 19th minute. Bukayo Saka\u2019s shot from Ozil\u2019s cutback was parried by goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher and Lucas Torreira netted while offside.\n\nBut with no VAR used in the competition, the goal stood.\n\nLiverpool fell behind when Kelleher parried Sepp Van Den Berg\u2019s deflection to Gabriel Martinelli who netted in the 26th. Martinelli, the Brazilian teenager, then made it 3-1 from another rebound 10 minutes later - taking his tally for the season to seven goals.\n\nThe absence of video replays cost Liverpool again when Naby Keita\u2019s shot hit the outstretched hand of Hector Bellerin. But from the resulting corner, Harvey Elliott was fouled by Martinelli and Milner netted from the penalty spot.\n\nOrigi should have powered home a header before the break but the biggest surprise of the night was Milner leaving a back-pass short 10 minutes into the second half.\n\nMaitland-Niles overran the ball but Ozil\u2019s drag-back retrieved the ball close to the byline presenting his teammate with a simple goal to put Arsenal 4-2 in front.\n\nBut after former Arsenal forward Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain\u2019s strike from distance, Origi produced the first of Liverpool\u2019s equalizers.\n\nHe was required again deep into stoppage time with a volley, just when it seemed Joe Willock\u2019s 70th-minute strike would be enough to send Arsenal through.\n\nBut after scoring five in regulation time, Arsenal couldn\u2019t repeat the feat. Liverpool did, the fifth netted by the 18-year-old Jones.\n\n\u201cBeing a local lad it\u2019s always been my dream to get an appearance at Anfield,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cI was calm, I picked my spot and I was fortunate enough that the winning penalty went in. The team played great, they showed character and belief.\n\nWith the shootout win, Liverpool remains in contention for every competition this season while sitting six points clear at the top of the Premier League.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "After 19 goals on a wild night at Anfield - nine in a penalty shootout - Liverpool ousted Arsenal in the League Cup to reach the quarterfinals.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/30/britain_soccer_league_cup_72852_c0-159-2868-1832_s1200x700.jpg?654a585bb136186e3fc545c5713c811f79882a2f", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
