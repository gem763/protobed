It\u2019s still both border security and humanitarian by virtue of what we are seeing, even last month,\" CBP Deputy Commissioner Robert Perez said during an interview with Fox News last week. \"Our colleagues in immigration and customs enforcement, they are the primary agency charged with longer-term detention. We at customs and border protection, and particularly the border patrol, both at our ports of entry and at those stations, are really short-term holding facilities. As everybody knows, over the course of the summer they became absolutely oversaturated. These are facilities that were never meant to hold people long-term.\u201d\n\n\n\n\"Congress just got back in town. It is time for them to get to work with us to find lasting solutions to this ongoing challenge,\" he continued. \"What I can tell you by virtue of nearly 27 years of experience and being a career law enforcement professionals is this: it\u2019s that the challenges and the loopholes to the legal framework that have been fueling first the border security crisis that evolved into a humanitarian crisis have been present through several administrations. Not just the last two \u2013 in some cases even beyond that.\"", "description": ".09/16/2019 19:10:15PM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Pavlich", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa", "Guy Benson"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/169/bcb78eef-5d80-446c-ab99-1e7bc8fefbab.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
