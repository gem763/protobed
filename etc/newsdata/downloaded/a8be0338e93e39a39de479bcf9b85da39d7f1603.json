And just because you\u2019re paying more doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019re getting more. You may not get WiFi until you\u2019re 10,000 feet in the air, and when you do get it, it may be slow and spotty. Even so, people are still willing to cough up their cash to post pictures of clouds mid-flight, or do some actual work.\n\nThe industry is expected to be worth $US30 billion by 2035. That\u2019s more than what Walmart is worth now. But if it\u2019s such a huge industry, why does in-flight WiFi still suck?\n\nFirst, we need to talk about how these planes, speeding around at hundreds of miles an hour, 36,000 feet in the air, can even get WiFi. There are two ways: towers on the ground or satellites in space.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the towers. This method is called air-to-ground, or ATG for short. Antennas on the belly of the craft pick up signals from cell towers on the ground. The benefit? You\u2019ll get less delay because the towers are closer to your plane than a satellite. The downside? No towers, no signals. That means when you\u2019re flying over large bodies of water, above mountains, or passing over countries with cell towers that restrict WiFi access, you probably won\u2019t get any WiFi.\n\nSo, what about satellites? The big dome-shaped antenna on top of the plane will pick up signals from the satellites. These satellite-based systems will either use Ku-band or Ka-band connections, which is similar to 3G versus 4G. There\u2019s a whole debate on whether Ku or Ka band is better, but they\u2019re both way faster than ATG systems. But when you\u2019re sharing internet with a couple hundred other people, travelling 500 miles per hour, 36,000 feet in the air, there\u2019s bound to be a hiccup or two. But towers versus satellite isn\u2019t the only thing that affects whether you\u2019ll be able to stream this week\u2019s episode of \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d or not.\n\nThe quality and price of your in-flight WiFi actually depend on four more things: your airline, aircraft, the in-flight Wi-Fi provider, and the region you\u2019re travelling to and from.\n\nFirst of all, in an effort to cut costs, some airlines, like Frontier, don\u2019t even offer WiFi. If your airline does offer WiFi, it could be free, or go all the way up to $US30 for an all-day pass. But just because the airline offers WiFi doesn\u2019t mean your plane supports it. Some aircraft aren\u2019t even built with WiFi capabilities. An American Airlines Boeing 738 might have satellite-based WiFi, but an American Airlines Boeing 757 might not.\n\nThen there\u2019s the provider. They all offer different speeds, which is crucial for watching those meltdowns in HD. And lastly, you\u2019ll need to factor in your route. If you\u2019re flying over a lot of mountains or an ocean, there probably won\u2019t be many towers along the way. And if the plane isn\u2019t equipped to receive satellite internet, you\u2019ll be completely out of luck.\n\nFor a while, Hawaiian Airlines didn\u2019t want to invest in in-flight WiFi because the technology along their flight paths crossing the Pacific Ocean was sparse, but communication companies are launching new satellites, and Hawaiian is rethinking the investment.\n\nSo, why isn\u2019t everyone upgrading their equipment? For some airlines, it\u2019s just not their highest priority. Upgrading equipment means taking planes out of service for a few days, which means airlines lose money. It also means budgeting for new infrastructure. Plus, at least one in-flight provider has 10-year contracts with some of the airlines, which doesn\u2019t leave a lot of wiggle room for upgrades and changes.\n\nBut better and faster in-flight WiFi is definitely on its way. American Airlines, for example, is making moves to invest in better in-flight WiFi. One survey showed that 67% of passengers would rebook with an airline if high-quality WiFi were available. In other words, good WiFi means customer satisfaction and loyalty.\n\nAirlines have good reason to upgrade their offerings, so it might not be a bad call for airlines to speed up the process. But for now, you\u2019re probably better off saving your reality-TV binge for when you get home.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
