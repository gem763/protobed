Eric Mayefsky, a digital analytics adviser for the Democrat presidential candidate, worked at Facebook between 2010-2014.\n\nNewly confirmed details of Zuckerberg\u2019s communication with the Buttigieg campaign is a \u201crare example of direct political involvement from one of tech\u2019s most powerful executives,\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s Tyler Pager and Kurt Wagner write.\n\nOf course, news of the emails is not the first time the two have crossed paths. In 2017, Zuckerberg and Buttigieg, both Harvard University alumni, hosted a Facebook Live discussion during the Facebook CEO\u2019s Midwest listening tour. The South Bend mayor made headlines in May when he expressed support for additional regulations on Silicon Valley giants like Facebook, despite his relationship with Zuckerberg.\n\nBloomberg News\u2019 report comes as a new poll released Monday shows that Buttigieg has risen to third place in the key primary state of Iowa.\n\nThe Suffolk University/USA TODAY poll states that former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) enjoy 18 percent and 17 percent approval from voters, while Buttigieg has garnered 13 percent. This boomlet comes after an obvious affectation of moderation during last week\u2019s primary debate \u2014 reversing course after months of trashing Trump voters, particularly evangelicals, as morally bankrupt and hypocritical.", "description": "Mark Zuckerberg has been quietly advising 2020 White House hopeful Pete Buttigieg (D) on campaign staff hires, a new report says.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1176382466-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
