We want to make smart people learn how to live like a human, how to care about others. When smart people learn how to care about others, how to care about the future, how to be human, then a company becomes warm, [things go] smoothly, and [it has] soft power. Otherwise, you have a group of gangsters,\" he said.\n\n\"This is why I believe we need more wise people and leaders,\" Ma continued. \"A smart machine will be always smarter than you are; a machine can never be wiser.\"\n\n\"Machines don't have hearts, machines only have chips. So, this is what I think: human beings should always learn to be wise.\"\n\nThe billionaire also suggested the education system be changed so that children are taught how to \"be a human\" in an era of artificial intelligence.\n\nHe identified skills like music, dancing, painting, and sports as \"very important\", as these are the kinds of artistic pursuits that engage people's hearts.\n\nRead more: Chinese tech billionaire Jack Ma says it's a 'blessing' for his staff to work grueling 12-hour shifts, 6 days a week\n\nOther key skills he said he considered essential were independent thinking, innovation, and creativity.\n\n\"When young people learn [about success] too much, they think they can easily succeed,\" Ma said. \"Learn from the mistakes, don't avoid them. When you make the mistake, know how to face it, how to solve it, how to challenge it. This is called wisdom. This is what we should teach our kids.\"\n\n\"It is important,\" he said, to applause from the audience. \"There are a lot of problems, but [there are] always solutions. We have to do it.\"\n\nThe Alibaba founder added that his focus was mainly on young people. \"Trust the young people. I trust young people more than I trust senior people, successful people \u2014 because there is no expert of the future, there are only experts of yesterday,\" he said.\n\n\"Working with most of the successful people \u2014 they only talk about yesterday. We are entering into a century, into a world, that is so new. When you're working with young people, you're talking about the future.\"", "description": "Billionaire tech executive Jack Ma is concerned that young people are ill-equipped to survive the digital era.", "authors": ["Rachel Genevieve Chia", "Sophia Ankel", "Business Insider Singapore"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da6f88bcc4a0a18e46dd7c3?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
