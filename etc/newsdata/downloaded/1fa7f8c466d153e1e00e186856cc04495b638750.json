Filmmaker Andrew Patterson readily admits he partially based his debut feature on a real-life event\u2014the 1955 Kecksburg incident\u2014and even the initial idea that led him to researching Kecksburg struck Patterson as familiar. \u201cI have a document in my phone of three or four dozen single line movie ideas,\u201d he told Ars. \u201cThis one said, \u20181950s, black and white, New Mexico, UFO film.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut The Vast of Night ultimately doesn\u2019t hinge on how its plot plays out. This small budget, tightly scoped sci-fi film has wowed festival audiences enough to attract Amazon money largely on its spectacle\u2014individual images you\u2019d gladly frame for the office wall, dialogue that draws you in no matter the subject, sonic flourishes that stick with you long after the credits roll. Talking to the filmmaker after a recent Fantastic Fest screening, it becomes hard to shake the feeling he\u2019ll be managing a much larger studio budget of his choosing in the very near future.\n\n\u201cWe knew we were working in a genre that was shop-worn, nothing new,\u201d Patterson says. \u201cWe wanted to let people know, \u2018OK this is an abduction in New Mexico\u2014we know this story, you know this story. How can we find a way in and do something special, to make something new?' I wanted to make it like the films I enjoy, which are usually about people learning about each other, their dynamics and relationships. So, OK, I want to start this like it\u2019s a Richard Linklater movie\u2026 then we get side-swiped into something extraordinary.\u201d\n\nAmazon / YouTube\n\nFantastic Fest / Fons PR\n\nAmazon / YouTube\n\nAmazon / YouTube\n\nAmazon / YouTube\n\nAmazon / YouTube\n\nFantastic Fest / Fons PR / Mondo\n\nMidwestern maker mojo\n\nPatterson has worked as a videographer and amateur filmmaker around Oklahoma City for years, partially financing The Vast of Night from funds gained through shooting Oklahoma City Thunder promotional videos. All those reps have evidently built an incredible technical base for this first-time filmmaker. It may have taken four years to go from script to screen, but the craftsmanship behind this film only grows more impressive (and becomes more glaringly obvious) as the story unfolds.\n\nTo start, The Vast of Night\u2019s period touches appear seamless but took a lot of care. Basketball in the 1950s, for instance, has no three-point line or modern backboards, and the game didn\u2019t feature endless pick-and-roll. So for the big rivalry game that would occupy most of the town in this story, Patterson and co. scoured Oklahoma and Texas until they found a gym in Whitney, Texas that could look the part. \u201cWe went and counted gyms, looked at 400 or so,\u201d he says. \u201cWe sanded the floor, got rid of the three-point line\u2014and that\u2019s a $20,000 cost, but I\u2019m glad we did it. I\u2019m enough of a sports guy that if I saw that and glass backboards, c\u2019mon.\u201d\n\nThe Vast of Night team took the same obsessive approach toward more central aspects of the film like the radio station and switchboard, too. (Patterson initially toyed with the idea of a stage play, and those locales would\u2019ve been two of three main sets.) To help these young actors better sink into the world and roles, Patterson wanted to make sure the switchboards used for the film could be actually used. They called up the Oklahoma City Museum of Telephone History and connected with passionate switchboard collectors in the area, eventually finding four functional switchboards and an enthusiast willing to modify them for 2019. \u201cHe got under the hood and got them functioning again, then he built a system where you can make calls,\u201d Patterson says. \u201cYou could pick up your cell phone, call the box, and then [Sierra McCormick, who plays Fay] could hear you in her headphones.\u201d\n\nThe old-school looking radio station required even more small film ingenuity. The team made a set for the interior of the station and hosted it next to the basketball court at the Whitney gym\u2026 because they didn\u2019t actually have permission to go into a radio station to film. \u201cWe knew they were going to bulldoze [the building for the town radio station] a month later, and the company had said, \u2018Yeah you\u2019re good to use it,\u2019\u201d Patterson recalls. \u201cSo we put that tower on top, those call letters in front, and then they said, \u2018We\u2019re not comfortable with this, we\u2019re not going to sign off.\u2019 And then we went and shot it\u2014it\u2019s in the movie. The production design team did a lot of work. Luckily it\u2019s night, so we got away with murder. \u2018There\u2019s a neon sign in the distance\u2014someone throw some duvetyne over it. Do we have permission? No. OK, no one\u2019s awake, go do it.\u2019 That way we could keep our dirty little secret\u2014there\u2019s a Subway five feet away.\u201d\n\nListing image by Amazon / YouTube", "description": "Film festival darling snuck up and attracted Amazon money, hits theaters/streaming in 2020.", "authors": ["Nathan Mattise"], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-24-at-4.55.47-PM-760x380.png", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
