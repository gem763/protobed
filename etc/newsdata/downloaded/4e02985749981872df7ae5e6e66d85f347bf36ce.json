He then called 911.\n\nProsecutors painted a scenario in which Kim was so drunk that he fell asleep in the vehicle. They said Hancock took advantage of it and drove around while he lay in the car unconscious to increase his fare.\n\nThey suggested that he then planted a knife in Kim's hand - which he admitted - to stage it as if they'd been fighting.\n\nHancock's defense was that he legitimately feared for his life and that the fight began when Kim made an unwanted sexual advance on him.\n\nHyun Kim, shown with his wife and son, was shot 10 times in June last year and died. He'd called an Uber after a night of drinking with friends. Prosecutors say he likely fell asleep in the car and that Hancock drove around afterwards to take advantage of him and get a higher fare. Hancock claimed the married father came on to him sexually then got aggressive when he was rejected\n\nKim is shown being stretchered away from the scene. Hancock called 911 himself after shooting him\n\nHis lawyers told the jury that he resisted Kim, telling him he was not interested, but that he proceeded to touch his leg in an inappropriate way.\n\nThey claimed that Kim became aggressive when he was rejected and that he started punching Hancock and grabbing him by his dreadlocks.\n\nThe knife, they said, was placed in his hand by the driver because he wanted to 'check if he was alive'.\n\nHancock took the stand claiming he feared for his life\n\nThe jury was not given an option of a lesser charge and instead had only to decide on the count of first degree murder which Hancock faced.\n\nThey acquitted him. He was taken back to the Downtown Detention Center where he will be processed and released from jail.\n\nHis family cheered in court and hugged while Kim's widow leaned her head forward onto one of the backs of the court benches and sat quietly.\n\nKim's blood alcohol level was .308 - nearly four times the legal limit.\n\nProsecutors said Kim had no history of behaving inappropriately towards Uber drivers in the years that he had used the app.\n\nHancock had a history of traffic infractions.", "description": "Michael Hancock was cleared of the murder of\u00a0Hyun Kim, a father who he shot dead on a freeway in Denver, Colorado, last year.\u00a0Kim had called an Uber to a bar where he was drinking with friends.", "authors": ["Jennifer Smith For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/22/19558942-0-image-a-16_1570741234208.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
