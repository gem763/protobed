REUTERS/Albert Gea/File Photo\n\nMADRID (Reuters) - Spain\u2019s La Liga is considering legal action after the first league Clasico of the season between Barcelona and Real Madrid was rescheduled for Dec. 18 by the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) on Wednesday.\n\nThe game was due to be played at Barca\u2019s Camp Nou stadium on Saturday, but was postponed following a request from La Liga due to extraordinary circumstances.\n\nThere has been unrest throughout Catalonia following the decision by Spain\u2019s High Court last week to jail nine Catalan separatist leaders for their role in an illegal referendum.\n\nProtesters have taken to the streets throughout the region and there have been numerous clashes with riot police.\n\n\u201cThe Competition Committee has taken the decision after analysing the dates proposed by both clubs, who were asked to reach an agreement and they both suggested that 18 December would be the best date to play the postponed game,\u201d an RFEF statement said.\n\nLa Liga, however, is unhappy about the new date and could take legal action following the decision of the RFEF with which it has an uneasy relationship.\n\nThe match was originally scheduled for 12:00 CET (13:00 local) on Saturday, catering for a global audience, and has now been moved to a Wednesday evening.\n\n\u201cLa Liga doesn\u2019t agree with the Competition Committee\u2019s decision to stipulate Dec. 18 - after an agreement was reached between Barcelona and Real Madrid, despite La Liga\u2019s objections - as the date in which the postponed Clasico should be played,\u201d La Liga said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe are studying the documentation that we have recently received regarding the process in which the decision was taken. This is in order to evaluate taking possible legal action and against whom it should be tabled, before the relevant and opportune public organisations or legal organisms.\u201d", "description": "Spain's La Liga is considering legal action after the first league Clasico of the season between Barcelona and Real Madrid was rescheduled for Dec. 18 by the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444105942&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M0SO", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
