The S&P 500 Value Index has returned about 5% since the start of August compared with the 0.9% for the S&P 500 Growth Index.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is that the winds of change are upon us,\u201d Wilson wrote in a report Sunday. \u201cThe long-overdue adjustment process for the most expensive secular growth stocks is under way and will likely continue until valuations become so cheap that they discount a more achievable outcome on growth and profitability and/or the risk of economic recession and lower capex subsides. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re there yet on either score.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a debate that\u2019s captivated stock pickers for years and is dividing Wall Street. Unless the economic outlook changes materially, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: ). strategists said this month they prefer growth over value, commonly defined as those trading cheap to fundamentals.\n\nWhile the S&P 500 Index approached a record high on Friday, some growth shares have been underperforming, and Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) highlighted software companies in particular. The S&P North American Expanded Technology Software Index is down 7.7% from its record reached on July 26. The gauge has surged 97% since the end of 2016 -- more than double the S&P 500.", "description": "Morgan Stanley Warns Growth Stock Underperformance Just Starting", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic0b4298eff55e98647e55edb7569b3f19.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
