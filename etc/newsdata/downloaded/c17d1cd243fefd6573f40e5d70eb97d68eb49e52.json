But creators and readers alike don\u2019t believe there\u2019s another website that fosters the same kind of sex-positive spaces that Tumblr has. It\u2019s as though Tumblr CEO Jeff D\u2019Onofrio has failed to understand his own platform, how unique these communities are to Tumblr, and how unlikely it is for them to survive beyond the shutdown.\n\n\u201cSex wasn\u2019t this separate, shameful thing. Tumblr allowed it to exist right next to every other facet of our messy, millennial experience,\u201d says Vex Ashley, who runs the blog Vextape that\u2019s inspired by her work as a cam model and making DIY porn. \u201cWe shared it, discussed it, debated it, and curated it.\u201d Porn, she says, was as appropriate on Tumblr as song lyrics.\n\nTumblr is home to a myriad of sex-positive and body-positive blogs, in addition to indie porn blogs and curated archives that provide something not found on Pornhub, YouPorn, or any of the other mainstream adult portals. It\u2019s also been relatively unique among social media sites for allowing nudity and sexually explicit content to be posted. Most sites, like Facebook and Instagram, prohibit nudity and regularly remove posts that are flagged. With Tumblr gone from the equation, creators and readers fear their hubs of sex-positive and body-positive content will vanish.\n\nIt\u2019s not the same thing \u2014 coup-de-zizi (@CoupZizi) December 4, 2018\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of value in being able to share images of and information about sexuality. This change will erase years of content from countless Tumblr users,\u201d says the anonymous author behind Bijouworld, which curates photos of vintage gay porn, old magazine covers, and newspaper clippings. They believe that other blogs focused on the history of erotica will also suffer. \u201cThis was a good spot for us all to exchange and combine our info and knowledge, so I hope we can find a new way to do that.\u201d\n\nBijou Classics, the gay adult company behind the blog, also posts regularly to Pornhub and maintains an extensive web presence across multiple platforms that allow adult content. But Tumblr, the blogger says, filled a void when the company wanted to explore the archival and historical aspects of gay porn.\n\n\u201cI do think Tumblr is unique ... [it] was one of the few platforms that is broadly open to the public where we could share explicit photos in any sort of organized fashion.\u201d The anonymous person behind the blog says that since 2011, Bijou Classics has \u201cused our Tumblr presence to post images from our archives, written blogs, trivia, and more.\u201d The purpose is to \u201ckeep information circulating about the history and evolution of erotica and gay culture.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe site has been pretty beloved for years now, so it\u2019s a shame for its followers.\u201d\n\nMany sexuality blog authors don\u2019t see a way forward without Tumblr. That includes lawyer and journalist Maddie Holden, who runs Critique My Dick Pic, a blog that\u2019s received attention from sites including The Hairpin, Jezebel, and The Daily Dot.\n\nHolden takes a media that\u2019s often considered a nuisance to receive and approaches it satirically as an art form, going in depth about the shadows and positioning of each photo. She ends her reviews with: \u201cthank you for submitting to critique my dick pic\u201d and a grade ranging from A to F. The latest lyrical review of a dick in the shower, posted on November 30th, reads, \u201cyour photo is certainly not coy but it avoids being dick-centric, and apart from minor flares of distraction \u2014 a green towel in the bottom-left corner and a blue razor in the windowsill \u2014 the background is uncluttered and effective.\u201d\n\nCritique My Dick Pic has been described by its followers as \u201chilarious and useful,\u201d says Holden. She says a trans woman recently told her that the trans-inclusive nature of the blog factored into helping her decide to come out and transition.\n\nThe blog has been around since 2013, but Holden says she\u2019s not sure if she\u2019ll move to another platform after Tumblr hides her content from public view on December 17th. Holden tells The Verge, \u201cI mean, it will be the end of the blog as far as I can tell. I receive a portion of my income from CDMP, which will end, and the site has been pretty beloved for years now, so it\u2019s a shame for its followers.\u201d\n\nThe operator of another quirky, body-positive blog, called Things My Dick Does, says he plans to keep his Tumblr open after the ban, but only to share safe-for-work posts to keep in touch with his readers.\n\n\u201cSeems like it\u2019s getting more and more difficult to express yourself.\u201d\n\nStarted by an anonymous man in 2015, the blog\u2019s creator draws mustaches and smiley faces on his dick, often placing props around it in amusing situations. He tells The Verge, \u201cI know it\u2019s a silly dick blog, but I\u2019ve gotten to know some pretty amazing people through here. (My girlfriend included!)\u201d He says that as he continued to post pics of his dick sipping coffee, dressed as Batman, or just smiling cheerily, he received positive feedback and even had a woman reach out to him because they lived in the same city. She later became his girlfriend. \u201cPeople say they\u2019ve overcome some serious rough spots in their lives because of the laughs I brought them.\u201d\n\nThe man says he can migrate to other platforms, but his presence on YouTube and Instagram is distinctly different. It\u2019s covered up and less NSFW, obscuring the very quality of his blog that disarmed audiences \u2014 a charming, dressed-up dick that more resembled a cartoon than graphic porn. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a loss to the adult content creators out there,\u201d the man behind Things My Dick Does says. \u201cSeems like it\u2019s getting more and more difficult to express yourself.\u201d\n\nThere just isn\u2019t anywhere else to go. Other than Tumblr, there aren\u2019t many mainstream, well-acknowledged platforms that allow unique adult communities to grow. Facebook and Instagram both prohibit sexual content and nudity; Twitter allows it, but it\u2019s not exactly known for its positive, supportive communities.\n\nAshley, who runs the curated, often DIY porn blog, explains that Tumblr was a livelihood and a home for people who didn\u2019t necessarily conform to mainstream porn sites\u2019 ideas of what is sexy. \u201cAs our lives move increasingly online, spaces that are safe for sex are becoming smaller and smaller,\u201d she says, in words that are now published on Medium. \u201cIf we continue to push our depictions of sexuality into the shadows, we allow them to continue to be defined and co-opted by the status quo \u2014 whatever is on the first page of a porn tube site.\u201d", "description": "Tumblr announced that it would ban all adult content from its platform and said any user who was hurt by the decision could simply migrate to another site.
