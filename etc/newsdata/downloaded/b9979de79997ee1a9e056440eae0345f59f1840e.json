One of the reasons why males are at a higher risk of getting gouty arthritis lies in the difference in gut microbiomes.\n\nMeanwhile, females' microbiomes on the skin are less diversified than those of males, which makes females at a higher risk of skin diseases such as allergic contact dermatitis, they added.\n\nThe research has been published in the journal Advanced Science and is expected to provide references and guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of microbiome-related diseases.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/30/5db8ea27a310cf3e97a3817a.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
