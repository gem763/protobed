On the other end, recording the call, was a young man battered by shame but anxious to get the priest to describe exactly what had happened in this little island village.\n\n\u201cI should have known better than trying to just have a life,\u201d the priest said in the November 2018 call. \u201cHappy days are gone. It\u2019s all over.\u201d\n\nBut, the young man later told the Associated Press, those days were happy only for the priest. They were years of misery for him, he said, and for the other boys who investigators say were sexually assaulted by Father Pius Hendricks.\n\nHis accusations ignited a scandal that would shake the village and reveal much about how allegations of sex crimes by priests are handled in one of the world\u2019s most Catholic countries.\n\nHe was just 12 - a new altar boy from a family of tenant farmers anxious for the $1 or so he\u2019d get for serving at Mass - when he says Hendricks first took him into the bathroom of Talustusan\u2019s little rectory and sexually assaulted him.\n\n\u201cI asked why he was doing this to me,\u201d the rail-thin 23-year-old said in an interview, the confusion still with him years later.\n\n\u201c\u2018It\u2019s a natural thing,\u2019\u201d he said the priest told him, \u201c\u2018It\u2019s part of becoming an adult.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe abuse continued for more than three years, he says, but he told no one until a village outsider began asking questions about the American priest\u2019s extravagant generosity with local boys, and until he feared his brother would be the next victim.\n\nIn November, he went to the police and told them what he knew.\n\nSoon after, local authorities arrested Hendricks, 78, and charged him with child abuse. Since then, investigators say, about 20 boys and men, one as young as 7, have reported that the priest sexually abused them. Investigators say the allegations go back well over a decade - though many believe it goes back for generations, and could involve many dozens of boys - continuing until just weeks before the December arrest. Hendricks\u2018 lawyers insist he is innocent.\n\nThe AP, which does not identify alleged victims of sexual assault, has met with five of the accusers.\n\nHendrick\u2019s arrest was a sudden fall for a priest who had presided over this community for nearly four decades. He rebuilt Talustusan\u2019s chapel and installed rooftop loudspeakers to summon parishioners to Mass. He pressed officials to pave the village road. He drove the sick to the hospital, and paid school fees for poor children. Many here will still tell you how much he did.\n\nBut the case also reflects much about the Philippines, a country where the church has long shrugged off the presence of its sex offenders and where the criminal justice system often ignores the problem.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a culture of coverup, a culture of silence, a culture of self-protection,\u201d said the Rev. Shay Cullen, an Irish priest who has spent decades in the Philippines and works with victims of child sexual abuse. \u201cIt\u2019s a silent consent to the abuse of children.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, after the young man had gone to police - but before Hendricks had been arrested - he recorded a phone call with the clergyman.\n\nIn extracts of the conversation heard by the AP, Hendricks laments the passing of those happy days, and admits to an unspecified \u201cmistake on my part.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s true. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not. Did I say it\u2019s not?\u201d Hendricks said, his voice a combination of self-pity and resignation.\n\nHe said he\u2019d probably have to retire.\n\n\u201cSo I have to learn,\u201d he continued. \u201cI have to take the good with the bad.\u201d\n\n____\n\nFor nearly two decades, the Philippine church has vowed to confront a looming shadow of clergy abuse.\n\nIn 2002, the Philippines\u2018 national conference of bishops ended years of silence to admit that the church faced \u201ccases of grave sexual misconduct\u201d among the clergy. One archbishop estimated that 200 of the country\u2019s 7,000 priests may have committed some form of sexual impropriety. The bishops promised new rules that would \u201cprovide steps for profound renewal.\u201d\n\nBut in a country home to more than 80 million Catholics and churches that date to the time of Shakespeare, such promises have long disappeared into a haze of tradition, piety and clerical influence that suffuses everything from sex education classes to national politics.\n\nUntil about 2013, for example, the church\u2019s own guidelines insisted bishops did not need to report sexually abusive priests to police, saying they had \u201ca relationship of trust analogous to that between father and son.\u201d Media reports and legal action \u201cadds to the pain\u201d in cases of sexual abuse, Manila Cardinal Luis Tagle told the Catholic news site UCAN in 2012. In Asian cultures, he said, it is often better for such cases to be handled quietly, inside the church.\n\nThe church\u2019s influence remains vast here, even as it has seen its power chipped away in recent years, weakened by the spread of evangelical missionaries and attacks by the nation\u2019s populist president, Rodrigo Duterte.\n\nDuterte, who says he was sexually abused by a priest while he was a student, has publicly derided bishops as \u201csons of bitches,\u201d and urged Filipinos to stop going to Mass. Investigators say Duterte is closely watching the Hendricks case.\n\nOn Biliran, the poor island where Hendricks spent nearly half his life, his fondness for boys had been widely discussed for decades among villagers, local officials and, according to a former Catholic brother, members of the clergy. While many people had long believed he was a pedophile, almost nothing was said openly. Nor did anyone act on the suspicions.\n\nThat\u2019s how it happens across the Philippines. Silence continues to shield priest after priest.\n\nOn the island of Bohol, the priest Joseph Skelton serves mass, more than 30 years after the then-seminarian was convicted of sexual misconduct with a 15-year-old boy. Local news reports reveal even more working clergyman: the priest outside Manila who recruited young men for the priesthood after admitting to sexually assaulting teenage boys; the priest who moved into a bishops\u2019 residence after being accused of raping a 17-year-old girl; the composer of sacred music accused of sexually abusing boys as young as six.\n\nProsecutions of accused priests are exceedingly rare here, and convictions are rarer. \u201cNo priest in the Philippines has ever been convicted\u201d of child sexual abuse, Bishop Buenaventura Famadico, who oversees a diocese south of Manila, told the Catholic newspaper La Croix last year.By comparison, the group BishopAccountability.org says that since 1990 more than 400 priests have been convicted in the U.S. on child sexual abuse charges.\n\nThe 23-year-old from Talustusan said he might not have come forward without encouragement from an American visitor to the village, the boyfriend of a woman related to an accuser. The American was shocked at the gifts the priest had doled out to him and other local boys and began to ask probing questions.\n\n\u201cHe kept asking why Father Pius was doing these things for boys in the village,\u201d said the 23-year-old, who began wrestling then with his own feelings about what he should say.\n\n\u201cI thought this might be it, this might be the help I\u2019m asking for, that my life will change,\u201d he said. Finally, he told his family, and then local authorities, about the abuse.\n\nEven then, the case may not have gone anywhere without intervention by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The agency started its own probe of Hendricks under a statute that allows the U.S. government to prosecute child sexual abuse by American citizens anywhere in the world.\n\nThe local case against the priest would have stalled if U.S. authorities hadn\u2019t started their inquiry, pressuring Philippine authorities to act, according to an investigator involved in the case, speaking on condition of anonymity because the investigation is still under way.\n\n____\n\nKenneth Hendricks was born in 1941 in working-class Cincinnati, as the Great Depression was grinding to an end. His parents divorced when he was young, and Hendricks\u2018 mother supported her two sons by cleaning houses.\n\nBy his late teens, Hendricks was interested in the Franciscans, the Catholic order of brothers and priests known for their long brown robes and centuries of work among the poor.\n\nHendricks became a Franciscan brother by his early 20s, taking the name Pius. His assignments ranged from the St. Catherine Indian School in Santa Fe, New Mexico to the then-rough Cincinnati neighborhood of Over-The-Rhine, where he helped run a youth boxing club.\n\nHis branch, the Province of St. John the Baptist, declined comment on his work, saying in a statement that it was \u201cfully cooperating with the authorities.\u201d\n\nResidents say Hendricks was still a Franciscan when he found his way to Talustusan, a village of about 2,000 people a couple miles uphill from the coast. It was a quiet place with dirt roads, a small school and a time-worn chapel above the Anas River. He left the Franciscans around 1986 and soon after was ordained as a priest by the local diocese.\n\nWhile Hendricks never learned to speak Bisaya, the primary local language, he seemed to love the village. He told his parishioners that he\u2019d be buried one day in a storage room behind the chapel. \u201c\u2018Here is my tomb!\u2019\u201d he\u2019d call out cheerfully, pointing to four concrete slabs set into the floor, near a battered statue of the Virgin Mary with broken hands and carefully manicured eyebrows.\n\nBut he never fit in fully. His quick temper and sharp tongue were intimidating. He chastised toddlers for not sitting at the front of the Talustusan chapel, and publicly berated adults who annoyed him. \u201cCrazy Filipino people!\u201d he would snap when he was frustrated.\n\nThen there were the boys.\n\nThey stayed at Hendricks\u2018 house, rode in his car and walked with him through Talustusan, residents say. He gave them gifts ranging from clothing to money to school fees.\n\n\u201cAll of us knew about Pius and his boys,\u201d said a former Catholic clergyman who worked with Hendricks for years, and who spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation from the church.\n\nOnce, at a gathering of priests and others, he said he erupted angrily at Hendricks, calling him a pedophile. That brought the clergyman a quick rebuke from church authorities who told him to keep quiet. Church officials declined to comment.\n\n\u201cAll of them knew about Pius,\u201d he said of church leaders on the island, the anger still in his voice years after the confrontation.\n\nSimilar comments are echoed in Talustusan, where there is no indication police or church authorities looked into the allegations.\n\n\u201cEver since I was young I heard the stories, that he would touch altar boys,\u201d said a longtime village resident, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing backlash from her neighbors.\n\nEven the local prosecutor barely blinked when the case was brought to her.\n\n\u201cI was not really surprised, because he was always with small boys,\u201d said Edna Pitao-Honor. \u201cWe were friends, actually. But that ends when he\u2019s facing prosecution.\u201d\n\nYet the church has done little to reckon with its role in what investigators now say was years of his abuse.\n\nThe Rev. Romulo Espina, a top official in the Diocese of Naval, where Hendricks served, insisted neither he nor other diocesan leaders saw any signs of sexual mistreatment by the American.\n\nBut Espina, who worked regularly with Hendricks in a small cluster of offices behind the main regional cathedral, also quickly made clear that if Hendricks did anything wrong, the church bears no responsibility.\n\n\u201cIf it is true, was he told to do it? No,\u201d Espina said. \u201cYou cannot attach the behavior to the institution. It is the devil.\u201d\n\nHendricks, Espina said, was told something similar.\n\n\u201cIf there is a criminal case, we told him \u2018This is your fight. You have to face the music.\u2019\u201d\n\n___\n\nPoverty is deeply rooted in Talustusan, where many people get by working on nearby coconut plantations or rice paddies. Others run informal gas stations, selling gasoline in old Pepsi bottles, or operate home groceries where they offer tiny bars of soap and packets of instant coffee for a few cents apiece.\n\nFor a village like Talustusan, having its own priest - particularly an American one - meant a financial boost, with donations to rebuild the chapel, and jobs as drivers and clerks. Hendricks became the center of his own small economy, doling out jobs, loans and gifts. He built a little library, where theological texts (The Law of Christ, The Catholic Catechism) sit beside secular fare (two biographies of Justin Bieber, a British royal wedding video).\n\nHis presence also brought status, setting Talustusan apart from the other poor farming villages.\n\n\u201cWe were the only village that had our own priest!\u201d said Ayelina Abonales, 55, one of the group of local women who now fiercely defend Hendricks.\n\nFor parents, having a church also meant their sons could earn a little money by serving as altar boys.\n\nIn a tradition common in Philippine villages- a custom often observed to this day - altar boys were expected to stay overnight on Saturdays at the priest\u2019s house. That way, they could get up early to prepare for Mass.\n\n___\n\nSometimes, the boy would try to stay home on Saturday nights, hoping to avoid the priest and the rectory and what he knew would happen there.\n\nBut Hendricks would send other boys running to the three-room house he shared with his parents and six siblings. The house is a monument to working-class aspirations and Catholic devotion, a plain concrete building decorated with school awards, plastic rosaries and statues of Jesus. \u201cThe priest wants you back there!\u201d they\u2019d call to the boy, now the 23-year-old man who reported Hendricks to authorities.\n\nHis mother would insist he stay at the rectory: \u201cIt\u2019s good for you,\u201d she would say.\n\n\u201cI had to go back,\u201d he said recently, sitting at a small beachfront restaurant, speaking above the gentle crash of the surf and the warble of karaoke singers crooning 1970s American love songs.\n\nHe believes most of Hendricks\u2018 altar boys were sexually abused, with some occasionally confiding in others about what was happening. But mostly, he says, it was a silent brotherhood of shame.\n\nVictims say the abuse often started off with Hendricks\u2018 bathing them, then progressing to oral and anal sex. Boys would often be cast aside once they reached their late teens or got involved with girls.\n\n\u201cHe got jealous\u201d if someone had a girlfriend, said a teenager from a troubled village family who said he was abused at age 15. The assaults ended after a couple months, the teenager said, when he refused to work as an altar boy.\n\nEven now, the 23-year-old can\u2019t explain why he kept returning to the rectory.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like I was trapped,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know myself anymore when I\u2019m there.\u201d\n\nIn part it was about money. Hendricks paid him a few dollars a week and eventually bought him a motorcycle. When he said he wanted to leave the village for a distant school, Hendricks built an extra room beside the family house, giving the young man his own bedroom.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want him to touch me. I only wanted to work for him,\u201d the 23-year-old said. \u201cBut then I was depending on him.\u201d\n\nThings finally changed in 2015 with a case of \u201ctulo\u201d - gonorrhea - which he says he got from Hendricks. After that \u201cI did not let him touch me anymore,\u201d he said.\n\nMost of Hendricks\u2018 accusers are from the lower rungs of the village\u2019s economic ladder, tough-talking teenagers with spiked hair and a love for noisy motorbikes.\n\nOccasionally, though, their defenses drop. At one point, the 23-year-old\u2019s voice drifts away, and he begins addressing Hendricks directly: \u201cFather, how could my life be without you? And why are you doing this to me?\u201d\n\nHe craves an apology: \u201cI want him to feel that inside I am already destroyed.\u201d\n\nExperts say victims can have immense trouble breaking away from their abusers, many of them adept manipulators who have woven themselves deeply into children\u2019s lives.\n\nThat confusion is amplified when abusers are priests, often revered as Christ-like figures in the Philippines, and amplified further when the priests are foreigners.\n\nA foreign priest \u201cwould be beyond any suspicion, and any complaint would be denied and covered up,\u201d said Cullen, the Irish priest.\n\nEven during the recorded phone call, the 23-year-old found no victory. He apologized repeatedly for what the priest was going through, even as he tried to get Hendricks to say outright what he had done.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry about it, Father,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\n\n___\n\nIn 2016, the Philippine church again committed itself to change, vowing \u201ctransparency, accountability and cooperation with civil authorities\u201d in clergy child abuse cases.\n\nAs a result, over the past few years, bishops and priests have launched awareness campaigns and run training sessions. Official guidelines now spell out victims\u2019 rights and bar moving predatory priests.\n\nInside the church, such regulations are seen as ground-breaking.\n\n\u201cFrom their perspective, they\u2019re making huge changes,\u201d said Dr. Gabriel Dy-Liacco, a Manila-based psychotherapist who has studied sexual abuse and is a member of Pope Francis\u2019 sex abuse advisory board.\n\nBut even as the church promises change it also appears to spread the blame, with a 2016 statement from the bishops\u2019 conference saying abused children are \u201cnot necessarily the passive partner in an exploitative relation.\u201d\n\nThe government, meanwhile, is often openly intimidated by the church\u2019s influence.\n\nPitao-Honor, the prosecutor who filed the charges against Hendricks, noted in court documents that the priest\u2019s stature, and the chaos that accusations against him could spark in Talustusan, made her proceed very carefully \u201cas if treading on top of eggshells piled one after the other.\u201d\n\nPlus, some key issues, such as when predatory priests must be reported to civil authorities, remain confusing , and experts say abuse cases rarely get reported. The Philippine church declined to respond to questions on those and other issues.\n\nSilence remains the rule.\n\n\u201cVery often it\u2019s taken care of quietly, and outside of the public sphere,\u201d said Dy-Liacco.\n\n___\n\nThere are those in Talustusan who mourn for Hendricks.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why they say these things about Father Pius,\u201d said Edrich Sacare, a 37-year-old from an impoverished family who spent nearly a decade living with Hendricks, working as an altar boy and at the church. Hendricks, in turn, sent Sacare to school. He insists he never saw Hendricks behave improperly. \u201cFather Pius was strict, but he was kind to people.\u201d\n\nA balding man in a basketball jersey, Sacare is in obvious pain as he speaks about Hendricks\u2018 arrest.\n\n\u201cAnyone who asked, Father Pius was willing to help,\u201d he said, sitting on the porch of his house, a short walk from the church. On the wall is a poster from his 7-year-old daughter\u2019s birthday party.\n\nThe accusations have divided the village, cutting through friendships and families and isolating the accusers, who say the benefits Hendricks brought - status, money, jobs - blinded villagers to his crimes. Often, the accusers say, they are shunned on the streets by people they have known all their lives.\n\nHendricks\u2018 supporters say the accusers invented the charges, angry the priest stopped financially supporting them. The priest\u2019s lawyers dismiss any talk of guilt, with attorney Melvin Vaporoso declaring him \u201cinnocent of the charges.\u201d\n\nNumerous priests and brothers and a retired bishop who oversaw Hendricks either declined comment or did not respond to repeated messages. In Cincinnati, the archdiocese has acknowledged Hendricks received some financial support from its missionary office but added a note to its website declaring, \u201cFr. Hendricks is not, nor has ever been, a priest of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati.\u201d\n\nFor now, Hendricks is being held in a Manila jail, facing Philippine and U.S. child abuse charges that could put him in prison for decades. U.S. Attorney Benjamin Glassman in Cincinnati, who filed the American charges, calls them \u201cvery serious, very disturbing allegations.\u201d U.S. investigators are also looking into whether Hendricks may have been involved in sexual misconduct during his time as a Franciscan brother in New Mexico and Ohio in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nPhilippine jails are notoriously overcrowded, and people in contact with Hendricks say he\u2019s losing weight and isn\u2019t sleeping well.\n\nBack in Talustusan his house sits empty. There\u2019s one chair at the dinner table. A houseplant is dying on the windowsill, its leaves turning brown. The narrow single bed is neatly made.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporters Dan Sewell in Cincinnati and Jim Gomez in Manila, and investigative researcher Randy Herschaft in New York contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The American priest's voice echoed over the phone line, his sharp Midwestern accent softened over the decades by a gentle Filipino lilt.
