The fund rented out offices through his partner\u2019s real estate company. The case was revealed by a French newspaper in 2017 and compelled him to resign from his Cabinet post at the time even though he wasn't yet formally charged.\n\nDespite Emmanuel Macron's own hard line on the need for politicians to be exemplary, \"Ferrand continues to have the president's trust,\" according to an Elys\u00e9e official. At the start of its mandate, Macron's government had set being formally charged as the threshold for resignation for members of the Cabinet.\n\nFerrand himself tweeted during the 2017 presidential election that \"a man formally charged... has lost all moral authority,\" in an attack against Macron's presidential rival, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, who was being investigated for another case of financial impropriety.\n\nOn Thursday morning, however, the goalposts seemed to have moved.\n\n\"Richard Ferrand is under investigation, he has not been condemned, and he is presumed innocent,\" said Sibeth Ndiaye, the government spokesperson, underlining Ferrand's democratic legitimacy as an elected member of parliament. An official in the prime minister's office said that there was a difference between a member of government and a member of parliament.\n\nFerrand's office maintains that he denies any wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cThe president of the National Assembly is determined to continue with the task conferred on him by his political family and his voters,\u201d it said in an overnight statement.\n\nFerrand has received public support from many lawmakers in his party La R\u00e9publique en Marche (LREM), while some political opponents on the left and on the right have called for his resignation.\n\n\"I demand that Richard Ferrand resign as president of the National Assembly!\" tweeted Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, a former presidential candidate and right-wing lawmaker.\n\n\"Being charged doesn't mean being guilty but the serenity of public debate supposes that those who have national institutional role resign while they await a judicial ruling,\" tweeted Socialist Party leader Olivier Faure.\n\nFerrand's legal troubles could possibly complicate Macron's efforts to push major reform bills through parliament this fall and to win difficult upcoming municipal elections.\n\nBeyond his personal proximity to Macron as one of his earliest and most steadfast supporters, Ferrand is expected to play an important role, as president of the National Assembly, in getting two landmark bills adopted that were central to Macron's campaign promises. Parliament is expected to debate a highly controversial pension reform bill and a major overhaul of bioethics laws that would broaden access to fertility treatments in coming months.\n\nFerrand is also one of the few LREM heavyweights with local political heft crucial for winning the upcoming municipal elections, having spent 36 years in the Socialist Party before joining Macron's party.", "description": "President of the National Assembly Richard Ferrand is one of Macron\u2019s most steadfast supporters.", "authors": ["Rym Momtaz", "David M.
