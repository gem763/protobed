He got sober five years before I was born, having been given six months to live if he carried on drinking at the same rate.\n\nMy mother was a lioness who was well respected in the music industry and constantly fawned over me and my sister.\n\nIn fact, my childhood was pretty idyllic. But this is just one of the lessons I have learned from my journey with addiction \u2013 it doesn\u2019t discriminate based on your childhood or where you come from.\n\nMy descent into addiction was founded on a constant yearning to escape from the discomfort I felt.\n\nWhen I joined a mixed school from a strict all-girls\u2019 private school, a whole world of booze (wangled on a fake ID), boys and drugs suddenly opened up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt soon became apparent that whilst my friends were up for a party, they knew when to stop. I didn\u2019t, and above all couldn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t long before I found myself drawn to my soon-to-be drug of choice \u2013 heroin. Shortly after, cocaine and crack came too.\n\nThere seems to be a misconception that heroin addicts are all homeless and down-and-out. I too had this misconception once. But today I have friends in recovery that were in that situation when they were using, and I also have friends who were in high-flying jobs with houses, families, kids and cars, and they managed to keep it all going with a raging habit.\n\nA friend once said to me, \u2018It doesn\u2019t matter if you are in first class or economy, if a plane\u2019s going down, it\u2019s going down.\u2019\n\nMy addiction took me to weighing six stone, with matted hair, scraping change together for heroin. At other times, I was in presidential suites, mansions, surrounded by things I had always dreamt of, puking into marble basins, knowing I was dying but unable to stop.\n\nFor many years I lived an addictively hedonistic lifestyle (Picture:Lu Lu C)\n\nLying, cheating and manipulating are the hallmarks of active addiction. As soon as we stepped into the outside world, we became a \u2018glossy, clean living, vegan devoted\u2019 pairing. My ex\u2019s staff were all sworn to secrecy about our real lives.\n\nHowever, as my addiction got worse, so did my behaviour. I was visiting my boyfriend in Oxfordshire one winter and stopped at a town centre public loo to get high before heading to his.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeveral hours later, I came round, freezing and surrounded by heroin paraphernalia and vodka and tonic that had spilt. Worse still, the loo had been locked for the night. Instead of embarrassing myself by telling my boyfriend the truth, I invented an excuse and spent the night there knowing I had ample heroin and alcohol to keep me numb.\n\nMy ex\u2019s father was a rockstar, and with that came endless money and a lot of \u2018yes people\u2019. My ex and I passed our time in an antique four-poster bed, surrounded by empty bottles and drug paraphernalia. We would wake in the middle of a dark winter\u2019s day with the same movies on a loop, not knowing what time it was.\n\nOne occasion particularly sticks out \u2013 driving back from a London Fashion Week show with my ex\u2019s parents and driver. My boyfriend, already high, couldn\u2019t wait for his next fix so asked to borrow the driver\u2019s belt and shot up in the back seat.\n\nHe was getting pure heroin from someone who was essentially a legal drug dealer. If you have the money, it\u2019s not uncommon for people to go to private doctors for prescription medicines of their choice. It might seem \u2018glamorous\u2019 but there is no glamour whatsoever to addiction.\n\nAddiction doesn\u2019t discriminate based on your childhood or where you come from (Picture: Lu Lu C)\n\nI\u2019ve been close to death on several occasions and was written off twice by the intensive care team that treated me. I was on life support with multiple organ failure and required an emergency operation to remove 12 inches of badly damaged intestine. Then followed three months in hospital being tube fed, and having to learn to walk again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy parents \u2013 scared and desperate \u2013 sent me to numerous rehabs from the age of 17. I have had many rock bottoms but my last was in 2016 when I finally realised there were two options: surrender to recovery or surrender to addiction.\n\nRecovery has allowed me to rekindle relationships with my family and repair past friendships that had been so badly damaged by my addiction.\n\nI started to laugh again, I became employable, and I was excited about life rather than fearing it. I follow a program of recovery and have found magic and solution in the self-help groups I attend.\n\nI have learnt that alcoholism and drug addiction is not only an illness \u2013 it is progressive, and can cause grave consequences. Prison and mental institutions are common and tragically many people die from it. I have been to the funerals of nearly 20 people who were unable to stop.\n\nAddiction can attack anybody, man or woman, rich or poor, old or young, of any culture or ethnicity. It causes unemployment, breaks up families, and destroys dreams and aspirations, not to mention costing the government huge sums of money in terms of medical treatment, unemployment benefits, lost productivity, police and social services.\n\nI am almost four years clean and sober now, I work in the film industry and have re-embraced my acting career. What I have today is never worth giving up for another drink or drug: I have self-worth, dignity, and true happiness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is as if I have lived two lifetimes in one life, and they couldn\u2019t be more opposite. I have realised just how precious life is, and I treasure what I have today. I just hope that anyone feeling hopeless and stuck in the pain and misery of alcoholism or addiction knows that there is a way out.\n\nPlease reach out for help.\n\nMore support For help and support with alcohol or drug addiction, contact Alcoholics Anonymous at help@aamail.org or via their free number 0800 917 7650 or visit Narcotics Anonymous at ukna.org Help Me Stop offers alternative \u2018dayhab\u2019 rehabilitation and is based in London.
