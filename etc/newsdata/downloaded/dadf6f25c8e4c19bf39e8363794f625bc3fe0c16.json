However, he echoed Pence\u2019s claims on the parameters of the agreement.\n\nAccording to a joint U.S.-Turkish readout of the meeting, the two sides agreed to a \u201csafe zone\u201d that will be \u201cenforced by the Turkish Armed Forces\u201d with U.S. cooperation. Kurdish forces will withdraw from a strip along the Syrian-Turkish border, dismantling their fortifications and handing over their heavy weapons.\n\nGen. Mazloum \u201cKobani\u201d Abdi, high commander of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), told Kurdish television that the SDF accepts a limited cease-fire between Ra\u2019s al-Ayn (Ser\u00ea Kaniy\u00ea) and Tel Abyad, and signalled that he will not accept a permanent Turkish presence in Syria.\n\n\u201cCease-fire is one thing and surrender is another thing, and we are ready to defend ourselves,\u201d said Salih Muslim, leader of the Democratic Union Party, the most powerful Syrian Kurdish faction. \u201cWe will not accept the occupation of northern Syria.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis wide divergence is a recipe for renewed conflict\u2014Turkey will likely claim that the SDF is not living up to the deal and will use this as justification for renewed attack,\u201d said Foreign Policy Research Institute fellow Elizabeth Tsurkov.\n\nWhen asked by the National Interest, SDF diplomats in Washington declined to comment.\n\nPence negotiated the agreement in an October 17 trip to Turkey alongside Ambassador James Jeffrey, who cancelled a last-minute congressional hearing in Washington to attend.\n\nThe agreement gave the SDF one hundred and twenty hours to comply.\n\n\u201cUnder the terms of the deal, championed by Vice President Pence, the SDF would essentially have to surrender the core areas of control to Turkey, and would essentially have to voluntarily deport itself from its homeland to someplace else in Syria,\u201d said Center for a New American Security fellow Nicholas Heras, who has advised U.S. counterterrorism officials. \u201cWhat President Trump's team has actually done is try to force the surrender of its best counter-ISIS partner in Syria to Turkey.\u201d\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Even\u00a0if the Trump administration moves closer to Turkey, the relationship between the country\u00a0and\u00a0Congress will sustain\u00a0long-lasting damage.
