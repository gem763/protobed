He also suggested he had married a 12-year-old girl.\n\nIn documents filed at the US District Court in California, Mr Unsworth\u2019s team described Mr Musk as a \u201cthin-skilled billionaire\u201d who set out to \u201cfalsely destroy\u201d their client because he felt insulted by criticism of a submarine the inventor had offered to help the cave rescue.\n\nMr Unsworth had called the offer a \u201cPR stunt\u201d which had \u201cabsolutely no chance of working\u201d and told Mr Musk to \u201cstick his submarine where it hurts\u201d.\n\n\u201cLike the bully that he is, Musk chose to lash out publicly at the criticism only by falsely attacking Unsworth, a relatively unknown individual, and publicly challenging him to sue for libel,\u201d wrote the diver\u2019s lawyer, Lucian Lin Wood, in the court filing.\n\n\u201cUnsworth accepted Musk\u2019s challenge in order to redress the false attacks on his reputation,\u201d he added.\n\nLast month Musk\u2019s legal team sought to have the lawsuit dismissed in a court document which the Space X founder claimed \u201cpeado guy\u201d was \u201ca common insult used in South Africa\u201d. He said the expression was synonymous with \u201ccreepy old man\u201d and was not meant to \u201caccuse Mr Unsworth of engaging in acts of paedophilia\u201d.\n\nMusk also claimed an August 2018 email to a BuzzFeed News journalist in which he referred to Mr Unsworth as a \u201cchild rapist\u201d was based on a private investigator\u2019s report that he did not know at the time was false. He later admitted he was \u201ca f***ing idiot\u201d for sending the email.\n\nMr Unsworth\u2019s legal team said Musk\u2019s accusations were \u201cfalse, defamatory, and were published negligently and with actual malice\u201d.\n\n\u201cMusk knows the truth but will not admit it,\u201d Mr Wood wrote.\n\nAccording to the court filing, Musk paid $52,000 (\u00a343,000) to a supposed \u201cprivate investigator\u201d who he did not vet for reliability and later described as a \u201ccon man\u201d who was \u201cjust taking us for a ride\u201d. The investigator, James Howard-Higgins, was jailed in 2016 for stealing more than \u00a3420,000 from his maritime company\u2019s accounts.\n\nMr Howard-Higgins told Mr Musk that Mr Unsworth had met his wife when she was \u201cat least 18 or 19 years old\u201d but the inventor \u201cnonetheless told the BuzzFeed reporter that Mr Unsworth is a child rapist who married a 12-year-old child bride,\u201d noted the document, which added the diver had in fact met his partner when she was 32.\n\nThe investigator, who admitted to Mr Musk that none of his information had been verified, was offered a $10,000 (\u00a38,200) bonus for \u201csuccessful confirmation of nefarious behaviour\u201d by Mr Unsworth, whose lawyers said the bonus was \u201cnever paid before no such evidence exists\u201d.\n\nHaving failed to uncover dirt on the diver, the court documents allege, Mr Musk ordered Mr Howard-Higgins to \u201cimmediately move forward\u201d with leaking information to the UK press \u201cto plant an unflattering story\u201d about Mr Unsworth and young girls \u201cwithout any disclosure that it was coming from Elon Musk\u201d.\n\nThe case is set to go to trial on 22 October.\n\nRead more\n\nThai cave rescue diver sues Elon Musk for defamation", "description": "Elon Musk paid a convicted fraudster to smear a British diving hero who he baselessly called a paedophile, according to court documents.The billionaire technology entrepreneur allegedly orchestrated a \u201cmalicious, false, and anonymous leak campaign\u201d in a bid to trash the reputation of Vernon Unsworth,", "authors": ["Chris Baynes"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xYB.IBcys3dh6lpMxgh3Eg--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/3d0d3c224204faa5aa2c3bb908052c84", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
