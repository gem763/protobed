Concerned about linking the two, Johnson called Trump directly and Trump refuted it, according to Johnson\u2019s accounts.\n\nJohnson is something of a wild card among Senate Republicans with little allegiance to party leaders after his 2016 campaign was left for dead by top Republicans; he was still reelected by nearly 5 points. But when it comes to the deepening impeachment inquiry into Trump, Johnson is instructive.\n\nWhen he raised questions last month about the White House restricting records of Trump\u2019s phone calls with foreign leaders, White House officials quickly assuaged Johnson\u2019s concerns. And as everyone in Washington puzzled over his admission about his own part in Trump\u2019s Ukraine saga, Johnson went on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d to make clear he\u2019s not joining the small band of Trump\u2019s GOP critics.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sympathetic with what the president has gone through. I have never seen in my lifetime, a president after being elected, not having some measure of well wishes from his opponents,\u201d Johnson said of Trump, citing the adversarial press coverage of Trump.\n\nJohnson in early September traveled to Ukraine with Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who followed Johnson on \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d Murphy said they are friends but he is \u201cdeeply scared\u201d by Johnson\u2019s stance on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThat interview was just a giant green light to the president of the United States to continue to solicit foreign interference in U.S. elections,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThis entire country should be scared, that at a moment when we need patriots, what we are getting is blind partisan loyalty.\u201d\n\nThe Connecticut senator concluded of Republicans: \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be fearful of this president. If they vote to get rid of him, there\u2019s nothing he can do to hurt them.\u201d\n\nBut in the meantime, Trump is making clear he\u2019s watching every public utterance of Republicans closely. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) asserted that even if Trump is impeached by the House, he'll likely be safe in the Senate, which would be responsible for holding a trial if the House votes to impeach.\n\n\u201cThe way that impeachment stops is with a Senate majority with me as majority leader,\u201d McConnell said in a video fundraising solicitation for his 2020 reelection campaign. \u201cBut I need your help. Please contribute before the deadline.\u201d\n\nTwenty-one years ago, McConnell said he would not \u201cprejudge\u201d the impeachment case against President Bill Clinton in the Senate since as a senator, he was a potential juror.\n\nRepublicans on the Sunday shows did little to break with the president, calling Trump\u2019s call for China to probe Vice President Joe Biden a joke and dismissing news that there\u2019s a second whistleblower.\n\nPolitically, it was easy to see why: Trump spent Saturday attacking Mitt Romney (R-Utah), one of three Senate Republicans who expressed concerns about Trump\u2019s invitation last week for China to investigate Biden. Romney described Trump\u2019s actions as a \u201cbrazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling\u201d; Trump retorted that Romney is an \u201cass\u201d and suggested he should be impeached. Despite Trump\u2019s suggestion, senators can\u2019t be impeached.\n\n\u201cThe media loves for Republicans to criticize each other,\u201d said Rep. Chris Stewart (R-Utah), who declined to defend Romney. \u201cMitt Romney\u2019s a big boy, President Trump\u2019s a big boy.\u201d\n\nNot every elected Republican is defending Trump. Aside from Romney, Sens. Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Susan Collins of Maine raised questions about Trump\u2019s most recent public statement that China and Ukraine should probe Biden. One of Trump\u2019s presidential primary challengers, former Rep. Joe Walsh (R-Ill.), said Trump \u201cdeserves to be impeached.\u201d\n\nBut other than that handful of Republicans, dissenting voices were absent Sunday, where even former Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.), who is also challenging Trump, declined to endorse Trump\u2019s impeachment and declined to commit to voting against him.\n\nAnd several Republicans went with Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s (R-Fla.) line: That Trump\u2019s call for foreign nations to investigate Biden can\u2019t be taken seriously.\n\n\u201cI doubt the China comment is serious,\u201d said Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), a member of GOP leadership.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\"\n\nSome Republicans also brushed aside the existence of a second whistleblower who has reportedly verified Trump\u2019s dealing with Ukraine. Stewart said the White House\u2019s release of a summary of Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president was far more salient than a pair of whistleblowers concerned with Trump\u2019s conduct.\n\n\u201cIt does not matter,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cWe have this transcript. Why should I care at all?\u201d\n\nFor the most part, despite the GOP\u2019s dismissals of new questions and revelations about Trump and his aides\u2019 conduct with foreign leaders, the Sunday show appearances were relatively civil despite, for example, Jordan\u2019s stonewalling of questions about whether Trump\u2019s calls for foreign election interference are appropriate.\n\nThe same could be hardly be said of Todd and Johnson.\n\n\u201cYou set this thing up totally biased,\u201d Johnson said of his interview. \u201cI would never be able to get the truth out \u2026 something pretty fishy happened during the 2016 campaign and during the transition and the early part of the Trump presidency.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry that you chose to come on this way, senator,\u201d Todd responded.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/b8/b3/82847cb64c31bf45f2f18f7c544f/20191006-ron-johnson-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
