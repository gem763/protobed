It needed a strong performance from goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen to take a 0-0 draw from Borussia Dortmund in its Champions League opener.\n\nBarcelona only had a combined four losses in the league over the previous two seasons, and two of those defeats came with the title already clinched.\n\nThe recent stumbles have not come against the top teams, with results such as a 2-2 draw at Osasuna, a recently promoted team like Granada.\n\nMessi has played limited minutes as he slowly returns from a leg injury. Su\u00e1rez also missed two games because of injury.\n\nFrance forward Antoine Griezmann, one of the league\u2019s top scorers when leading Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, has just two goals - both in the same match - since his high-profile transfer to help Messi and Su\u00e1rez share out the scoring.\n\nThe defense has suffered in particular. Holding midfielder Sergio Busquets, the glue of the team, has slipped a notch at age 31 and has no substitute in the squad.\n\nClub president Josep Bartomeu stuck with coach Ernesto Valverde after the loss at Liverpool despite calls for his firing. The pressure is now back on the coach.\n\n\u201cThe ones out there winning or losing are the players, but I take the responsibility for what has happened,\u201d Valverde said.\n\nThe next four matches could go a long way to deciding Valverde\u2019s future.\n\nBarcelona hosts Villarreal on Tuesday, and four days later visits the very physical Getafe. It then hosts Inter Milan in the Champions League on Oct. 2, followed by a visit from Sevilla.\n\nBILBAO BOSS\n\nBilbao leads a very evenly contested Spanish league that has seen no team win more than three games.\n\nThe club, which only has players from the northern Basque Country region and surrounding areas, has recovered its identity as one of the toughest competitors in the competition thanks to coach Gaizka Garitano, who arrived midway through last season.\n\n\u201cWe know our style of play and the core group of players is the same,\u201d Garitano said after Sunday\u2019s 2-0 win over Alav\u00e9s. \u201cWe are picking up where we left off last season. Opponents have a hard time finding scoring chances against us.\u201d\n\nBilbao hasn\u2019t lost at its San Mam\u00e9s Stadium in the league since October and beat Barcelona 1-0 in this season\u2019s league opener.\n\nDERBY AHEAD\n\nReal Madrid earned a much-needed 1-0 win at Sevilla on Sunday to quieten some critics following its embarrassing 3-0 loss at Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League.\n\nMadrid hadn\u2019t won at Sevilla since 2015. The most satisfaction for coach Zinedine Zidane was that the victory came from the hard work he had demanded from his players.\n\nNow Zidane can face next weekend\u2019s derby at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid more calmly - and even with confidence. First, Madrid will host Osasuna on Wednesday.\n\nBARCA WOMEN\n\nWhile its men\u2019s team struggles, the Barcelona women\u2019s side is flying high after crushing top rival Atl\u00e9tico Madrid 6-1 on Saturday to take the league lead.\n\nAtl\u00e9tico got off to a good start at Barcelona with an early goal. Barcelona rallied after an equalizing penalty by Jennifer Hermoso. Nigeria striker Asisat Oshoala fueled the rout with two well-taken goals.\n\nBarcelona has been the main challenger to Atl\u00e9tico, which has won the last three titles.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Barcelona hasn't recovered from last season's debacle at Liverpool.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joseph Wilson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/21/spain_soccer_la_liga_69012_c32-0-2234-1284_s1770x1032.jpg?f1d164169957fbdaf4f3529270b3908e126b1615", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
