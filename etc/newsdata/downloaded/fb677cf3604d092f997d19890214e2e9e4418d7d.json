The effort will target voters in nine key swing states: Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.\n\nTHE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN\n\nExecutive Director of the Planned Parenthood Votes Super PAC, Kelley Robinson, emphasized in a statement that \u201cnext November, our very rights and freedoms will be on the ballot. Already, we\u2019ve seen Trump and his buddies in Congress and state legislatures do everything they can to strip us of our rights and access to health care. Who we elect will determine our access to birth control, cancer screenings, sex education, abortion access and more.\u201d\n\nAppearing on \"Fox & Friends\" with host Ainsley Earhardt on Thursday, Johnson explained that: \"This is who Planned Parenthood has become. They're really not a health care provider. They have become a political force -- trying to elect candidates who also ascribe to their extreme views on abortion.\n\n\"If you look at Planned Parenthood's annual report over the past ten years, you see a trend. You see that their actual health care services that they provide...those are continually on the decline. The only service that continues to increase year after year is abortion,\" she told Earhardt.\n\nTENNESSEE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS DEFEND PRAYER BEFORE FOOTBALL GAMES AFTER ATHEIST GROUP COMPLAINS\n\n\"So, we see where their priorities lie and it's not with women's health care. And, if it was really about women's health care, they'd be taking this $45 million dollars and putting it back into their clinics, instead of using it for political action,\" she said.\n\nIn August, the group announced it was pulling out of the Title X federal family planning program rather than abide by a new Trump administration rule prohibiting participants from referring patients for abortions.\n\nPro-life groups heralded the abrupt decision as a major victory -- and one that signaled that Planned Parenthood, contrary to its claims, is primarily an abortion provider, not a health care organization.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\"President Trump took away their Title X funding, which is about $60 million dollars. They're pouring almost $60 million into elections,\" Johnson added.\n\n\"So, which is it? Are you a healthcare provider that truly cares about women or are you just a political arm that's trying to push abortion?\" she asked. \"It really can't be both.\"", "description": "A former Planned Parenthood clinic director, Abby Johnson, is calling on the organization\u00a0to redirect their funding efforts away from the 2020 elections and toward women's health.", "authors": ["Julia Musto", "Julia Musto Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/ABBY-CROP.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
