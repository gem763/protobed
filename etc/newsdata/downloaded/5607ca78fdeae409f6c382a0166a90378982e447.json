The game was called after a wait of 1 hour, 57 minutes.\n\nIt will be made up as part of a day-night doubleheader on Saturday with the first game starting at 1:10 p.m. The second game is scheduled to begin at 7:10 p.m.\n\nThe Twins entered the series leading the Indians by 3\u00bd games.\n\nMinnesota manager Rocco Baldelli had already planned to use his bullpen in Saturday\u2019s game, and the rainout will make things more challenging for the Twins.\n\nMike Clevinger, who has won his past 10 decisions, will start Saturday\u2019s opener for Cleveland.\n\nIf there was one positive for the Twins, they were closer to full strength as Miguel San\u00f3 and Max Kepler returned from injuries on Friday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The opener of a three-game AL Central showdown series between Minnesota and Cleveland has been postponed by rain.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tom Withers"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/twins_indians_baseball_42480_c69-0-4089-2344_s1770x1032.jpg?dddbc21926d4f40e47e6c9926ea855e8b47b5bc3", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
