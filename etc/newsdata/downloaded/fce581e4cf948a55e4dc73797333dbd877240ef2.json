The fire began at 9:27 p.m., according to California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.\n\nPG&E CEO Bill Johnson said the company is conducting an internal investigation, but said it has not accepted responsibility for the fire, adding that officials still don\u2019t know precisely how it started.\n\n\u201cWe still, at this point, do not know what exactly happened,\u201d he said at a news conference.\n\nAfter it sparked late Wednesday night, the fire spread rapidly. More than 10,000 acres were charred through Thursday afternoon. It was growing at a rate of 30 football fields per minute. Authorities struggled against the strong winds on Thursday, and the fire remained wholly uncontained as of Thursday afternoon, state authorities said. No injuries have been reported, but several structures have been damaged or destroyed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, 400 miles south, a rapidly expanding fire burned through Canyon Country, in northwest Los Angeles County, covering more than 5,000 acres by Thursday evening.\n\nForecasters expect conditions across California to get worse in the coming days, and PG&E warned even more blackouts will follow, a desperate hedge against further wildfire risk. The company said the next round of outages could begin Saturday and would be \u201con the magnitude\u201d of those earlier this month, the most extensive planned power shutdown ever.\n\nAs the Kincade Fire spread, the Sonoma County Sheriff\u2019s Office ordered mandatory evacuations, including for the entire community of Geyserville, and shut down several major roads.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is not the time to stay,\u201d Sonoma Sheriff Mark Essick said at a news conference. \u201cThis is the time to go.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAs the wildfire torched Sonoma, and others spread in San Bernadino, Los Angeles County and elsewhere, Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) railed against all three of the state\u2019s investor-owned power companies, including PG&E, which has already been forced into bankruptcy in the face of billions of dollars in liability claims stemming from previous fires.\n\n\u201cI must confess, it is infuriating beyond words,\u201d Newsom said, accusing the utilities of neglecting their infrastructure and leaving the state vulnerable to fires sparked by outmoded power lines.\n\nAD\n\nHis statements echoed those he made two weeks earlier, when PG&E shut off power to nearly a million customers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more than just climate change, and it is climate change, but it\u2019s more than that,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cAs it relates to PG&E, it\u2019s about dog-eat-dog capitalism meeting climate change, it\u2019s about corporate greed meeting climate change, it\u2019s about decades of mismanagement.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nNewsom sent a letter Thursday to the the CEOs of San Diego Gas & Electric Company, Edison International and PG&E demanding better communication about when the utilities would implement precautionary power shutoffs.\n\n\u201cThe only consistency has been inconsistency,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAD\n\nWeather forecasts in Northern and Southern California for the next several days have been ominous, portending more blackouts and, perhaps, more fires. The National Weather service said \u201cpockets of critical fire weather\u201d were likely.\n\nNWS issued red flag warnings on Thursday for much of the San Francisco Bay area, including the region where the Kincade Fire is burning, as blustering offshore winds met dry air and created tinderbox conditions.\n\nEven though wind speeds were expected to lessen on Thursday, weather conditions through the weekend may bring new challenges to containing the fire. The offshore gusts, known as \u201cEl Diablo\u201d winds, bring extremely dry air, with relative humidity plummeting to the single digits in some cases, making fire fighting particularly difficult. Forecasters expect a second round of those winds to blow across much of California in the coming days.\n\nMeanwhile, in Southern California, \u201cextremely critical\u201d fire risk was forecast, with strong offshore winds, known there as Santa Ana winds, gusting up to 65 mph in parts of Ventura and Los Angeles counties through Friday.\n\n\u201cThe fuels and vegetation are critically dry. The expected weather will create an environment ripe for large and dangerous fire growth, especially Thursday and Friday,\u201d the NWS forecast office in Los Angeles wrote.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe intense winds can be seen blowing the fire in an early-morning video at Hawkeye Ranch in Geyserville, captured by Santa Rosa Press Democrat photographer Kent Porter.\n\nSusi Weaver, manager for the Hawkeye Ranch protects her belongings from the fast moving #KincadeFire #kincaidefire above the Alexander Valley \u2066@NorthBayNews\u2069 \u2066@CAL_FIRE\u2069 pic.twitter.com/x3jvBHTRbc \u2014 Kent Porter (@kentphotos) October 24, 2019\n\nThe Kincade Fire comes two years after the deadly Tubbs Fire devastated nearby Santa Rosa. At least 22 people died, and more than 5,600 homes and buildings were destroyed.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Powerful winds spread the wildfire across more than 10,000 acres as of Thursday afternoon.", "authors": ["Reis Thebault", "National", "Breaking News Reporter", "Kim Bellware", "Reporter Covering National Breaking News", "Andrew Freedman", "Editor Focusing On Extreme Weather", "Climate Change", "Science", "The Environment."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ybRHjVvkaPE9Q2dq-_y4t3_HGxg=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-24-2019/t_3d8f66dd8b054c6484264a1877f88b45_name_1___1920x1080___30p_00_00_01_09_Still016.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
