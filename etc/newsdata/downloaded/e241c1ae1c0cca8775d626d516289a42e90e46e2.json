Why? Well, I have been in a life rut and watching far too much TV than is normal.\n\nThis means I actually know who everyone is this year and am equally excited to see what all these people I consider my \u201cfriends\u201d (I know, I need help) are wearing.\n\nAlso I missed my bus this morning so that\u2019s all the intro you get \u2013 here\u2019s my picks and not-picks for the 2019 Emmy Awards red carpet looks.\n\nPHOEBE WALLER-BRIDGE\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a crush on this woman WHAT IS THE POINT. WHY ARE YOU HERE. If you don\u2019t know this woman, get out of my sight. Just kidding \u2013 I only require you to hang your head in shame and have a soft cry, then immediately walk out of work, download Fleabag S1/2 and Killing Eve S1/2, followed by Crashing, and get acquainted.\n\nI don\u2019t care what she\u2019s wearing, she could have arrived in glad wrap and I would have squealed in delight and given her 10\u2019s across the board.\n\nPHOEBE WALLER-BRIDGE, SIAN CLIFFORD & ANDREW SCOTT\n\nThis is just a PWB fan account now. Look it\u2019s my mum and my dad and my favourite aunty. I do have to just gently chastise Sian for those shoulder flaps.\n\nJODIE COMER\n\nI swear I\u2019ll move on from PWB-based content after this, but oh my god how goddamn good does Villanelle look when she\u2019s not murdering people? Also while she\u2019s murdering people, but you know.\n\nI thought I hated the bikini-top-with-sleeves vibe up there but I\u2019ve decided I don\u2019t.\n\nEMILIA CLARKE\n\nChaotic evil would be wearing this dress without any gaffer tape binding it to your skin. I do wish I never looked closely and saw the weird lower-hip ruffle that makes the whole thing look like a really nice dress, with a weird bumster-jeans-level skirt on top but look, if you just squint it\u2019s a 10/10.\n\nAMY POEHLER\n\nThis is on par with the time I thought wearing navy blue eyeshadow up to my eyebrows to Year 10 formal was a good idea.\n\nKARAMO BROWN\n\nOof look, I want to love this but the cape looks so CHEAP, you know? Karamo, you almost had it! And you\u2019re always so good. I\u2019m sad.\n\nGWENDOLINE CHRISTIE\n\nI don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening here but I vote Gwendoline for the next Pope, if that\u2019s what this is about.\n\nNATHALIE EMMANUEL\n\nSpeaking of Year 10 formals, this is almost exactly what 150/200 girls wore to mine.\n\nBRITTANY SNOW\n\nThis is some real Cinderella energy and normally I\u2019d fucking hate it, but Brit Snow IS basically Cinderella IRL. How has someone not tapped her for any/all remakes of Disney princess films.\n\nZENDAYA\n\nIf Brittany Snow is Cinderella, Zendaya is WASTED not playing The Little Mermaid rn. This is H E A V E NNNNNNNNNN.\n\nTARAJI P. HENSON\n\nSomeone had better have been scream-whispering \u201cTARAJI!\u201d every ten seconds as Taraji walked the red carpet, is all I\u2019m saying. This dress demands it. This pose demands it. TARAJI DEMANDS IT.\n\nMARISA TOMEI\n\nMarisa, silently screaming/mentally firing her stylist because she\u2019s arrived as Taraji Lite.\n\nNAOMI WATTS\n\nWhen I saw this from far away I was all mehhhh, but up close the level of detail in the overlay and the bodice? Absolute heaven.\n\nRUPAUL\n\nI mean, I expected nothing less.\n\nLILY SINGH\n\nIt\u2019s a TAD Textiles 101, but the colour is fab on Lily and her hair/makeup is on point.\n\nSACHA BARON COHEN & ISLA FISHER\n\nI wish they\u2019d co-ordinated bc I love a couples co-ordination, but I love Isla\u2019s shimmery dress and frankly I\u2019m just relieved these two are keeping my belief in love going by not splitting up like every other goddamn Hollywood couple (I\u2019M NOT OVER IT MILEY AND LIAM).\n\nBILLY PORTER\n\nPose is all I care about right now besides PWB based content, if you haven\u2019t watched it DO IT IMMEDIATELY. I knew Billy wouldn\u2019t disappoint, and goddamn he has not disappointed. I want to buy a house on his hat and live there.\n\nJOEY KING\n\nOne of the only people I will allow to wear a Year 10 formal dress on the red carpet, because she exclusively plays Year 10 students.\n\nMAHERSHALA ALI\n\nAnd the only person allowed to wear idiotic useless sunglasses on the red carpet because let\u2019s be honest, he looks fucking TIGHT in them.\n\nHALSEY\n\nYeah ok Halsey, I can fuck with this. That train is literal art.\n\nJAMEELA JAMIL\n\nI\u2019m concerned Jameela won\u2019t be able to hug anyone considering her right arm is in prison c/o that one sleeve, but this is very much HER colour and the contrasting orange/red lippie is a good vibe.\n\nBENICIO DEL TORO\n\nThere was a weird brief period of my life where I had an uncomfortable crush on Benicio Del Toro, and I hate that this has brought it to the forefront of my mind again.\n\nSANDRA OH\n\nThe hair is a bit manic in side-view shots of this situation, like very much a pineapply curl thing but in that way where you just piled your filthy hair on your head to get it off your face during an all-nighter study sesh, you know? Here, look:\n\nI see what they were going for but I also wish they\u2019d contained their excitement a little. That being said this dress is a VISION on Sandra, and that wash of pale pink shadow could have gone so wrong, but it\u2019s gone so, so right.\n\nNIKOLAJ COSTER-WALDAU\n\nYou know I\u2019m partial to men in suits that aren\u2019t borza black tux\u2019s, so Nikolaj was already winning but then he came at us with the gold brocade!?!?! Bitchhhhhh this is too much, I\u2019m having a small asthma wheeze.\n\nKERRY WASHINGTON\n\nWHEEZING OVERLOAD, this is too fucking good!! Kerry [clap] HANDLED [clap] IT. It\u2019s 100% handled. Olivia Pope would never, but she should.", "description": "It's the 2019 Emmy Awards baby!
