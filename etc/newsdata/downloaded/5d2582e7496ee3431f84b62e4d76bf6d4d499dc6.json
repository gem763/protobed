Buzz60's Sean Dowling has more. Buzz60\n\nGoogle is trying to help you not be a password weakling.\n\nAfter all, you have more than two dozen online accounts, yet use the same password across most \u2013 if not all \u2013 of them. And because it is so darn difficult to remember a complex sequence of letters, numbers and special characters, the passwords that you do drum up are too easy to guess.\n\nYou\u2019re not alone. According to a new poll released Wednesday by Harris Poll and Google, 75% of Americans are frustrated with trying to keep track of their passwords.\n\nSo, Google is adding a new \u201cPassword Checkup\u201d feature to the Chrome browser and the existing Google Account Password Manager that with a single click can warn you if your passwords are too weak or too often used in multiple places. The tool can also let you know if Google discovers passwords that have been compromised through a third-party breach.\n\nGoogle Password Checkup can warn you when your passwords are weak or reused.

Baig)\n\nGoogle timed its announcement to coincide with Cybersecurity Awareness Month.\n\nPreviously, you had to add the Password Checkup tool as an extension to Chrome.\n\nThe move comes as Google's privacy practices have been under the scrutiny of lawmakers, along with other tech giants Amazon and Facebook. Google also added new privacy tools for YouTube, Google Maps and the Google Assistant.\n\nZantac cancer risk: Zantac pulled over cancer risk: What we know\n\nIf a potential password vulnerability is flagged, you can update or change any at risk passwords by going to the website or app and saving it to your password manager when Google prompts you to do so.\n\nThe problem Google is trying to address obvious: If a malicious hacker is able to crack your password at single site, the attacker may very likely be able to break into numerous accounts with that identical password.\n\nAmericans are too lax with passwords\n\nAnd those passwords are way too often far from secure.\n\nIn the Harris/Google poll, 24% of Americans have used such common passwords or variations on, \u201cabc123,\u201d \u201cPassword,\u201d \u201c123456,\u201d and \u201cIloveyou,\u201d among others. And 59% have incorporated a name or birthday into an online account password, and 33% a pet\u2019s name.\n\nWhat's more, 27% have attempted to guess someone\u2019s else\u2019s password, and of those people 17% guessed right. The poll also revealed that about 10% of Californians still have access to a password used by an ex-partner or roommate.\n\nGoogle plans to integrate its password checkup technology into Chrome later in the year. The company says that if one of your usernames and passwords has been compromised in a known data breach, Google will show an automatic warning and suggest that you change your password.\n\nManaging privacy on Google Maps, YouTube, Google Assistant\n\nGoogle announced a series of other privacy and security-related measures on Wednesday.\n\nIt is rolling an \u201cIncognito mode\u201d feature into Google Maps that promises to keep the searches within Maps private. Such searches won\u2019t be saved to your Google Account and won\u2019t be used to personalize your Maps experience. And yes, you can turn the mode off if you do want, say, tailored restaurant recommendations based on earlier searches or your commute. Incognito mode will start rolling out on Android this month, with iOS availability to follow later on.\n\nGoogle is also expanding on an auto-delete feature by bringing it to YouTube. You can set the time frame in which to keep or discard your YouTube data \u2013 3 months, 18 months, or until you choose to delete. It is similar to controls that were previously introduced for your web and app activity.\n\nYou can also use your voice to control privacy when engaging with the Google Assistant. If you ask questions such as \u201cHey Google, how do you keep my data safe?\u201d the Assistant will respond with information about how the company attempts to do just that.\n\nIn the coming weeks, you\u2019ll be able to delete the last thing you said to Google merely by asking. Or you might say, \u201cHey Google, delete everything I said to you last week.\u201d\n\nIf you ask to delete more than a week's worth of data from your account, the Assistant will direct you to the page in your account settings to complete the deletion.\n\nGoogle is rolling out this voice feature in English next week, and in all other languages next month.\n\nEmail: ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow @edbaig on Twitter\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/10/02/google-security-and-privacy-tools-your-passwords-too-weak/3837751002/", "description": "Google is introducing tools to help you fix passwords that are too weak.
