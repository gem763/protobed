Police fired tear gas in several areas as demonstrators lobbed bricks and gasoline bombs in confrontations that have become a regular occurrence during the 4-month-old protest movement.\n\nLawmaker Dennis Kwok said the High Court refused to grant an injunction on the mask ban but agreed to hear later this month an application by 24 legislators against Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam\u2019s use of emergency powers to impose the rule by circumventing the legislature.\n\nThe embattled leader has said the ban on masks, which allows radical protesters to conceal their identity, was needed to stop widespread violence that has \u201csemi-paralyzed\u201d Hong Kong. It is also the biggest challenge for Chinese President Xi Jinping since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.\n\nMany malls, shops and the entire MTR network of subways and trains were shut Saturday following an overnight rampage. About half of the city\u2019s 94 subway stations reopened Sunday, but some quickly shut again after protesters vandalized stations, set street fires and thrashed shops and banks linked to China.\n\nMany malls also remained shuttered as streets downtown turned into a sea of umbrellas, with protesters chanting \u201cHong Kong people, resist.\u201d The rally disbanded after police deployed tear gas to break up violence and detained over a dozen young protesters. Tear gas was also used in the city\u2019s Mong Kok district.\n\nCritics fear the use of the Emergency Regulations Ordinance that gives Lam broad powers to implement any measures she deems necessary in an emergency could pave the way for more draconian moves. The law was enacted by British colonial rulers in 1922 to quell a seamen\u2019s strike and was last used in 1967 to crush riots.\n\nLam has not ruled out further measures if violence continues.\n\n\u201cThis emergency law is so ancient and draconian. Carrie Lam is using it as some sort of weapon of mass destruction to nuke Hong Kong,\u201d said legislator Claudia Mo.\n\nEven though the court rejected the legal challenge, Kwok and Mo welcomed the decision to expedite the hearing. The court didn\u2019t set a hearing date but indicated it would be at the end of October.\n\n\u201cThis is a constitutional case. The court has acknowledged there is controversy involving the use of the emergency law,\u201d Mo said.\n\nLam has said she will seek the backing of the legislature when it resumes Oct. 16. Mo called it a sham because only Lam has the power to repeal the mask ban under the emergency law.\n\nMany protesters who wore masks Sunday said the ban curtailed their freedom of expression. The ban applies to both illegal and police-approved gatherings, and carries a penalty of up to a year in jail and a fine.\n\n\u201cCarrie Lam is not the god of Hong Kong. She can\u2019t do anything she likes,\u201d said retiree Patricia Anyeung, who wore a mask while marching with her sister, Rebecca.\n\nA police official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media said some arrests were made Sunday for violating the ban, but he couldn\u2019t give any numbers.\n\nEnforcement proves tricky in a city where masks have often been used since a deadly respiratory disease outbreak in 2003. The government said Saturday that it won\u2019t prohibit the public from wearing masks for health reasons amid the current flu season.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t arrest us all. There are thousands of us,\u201d said Anyeung. \u201cThere is no going back \u2014 we are at the point of no return.\u201d Anyeung, who holds a British passport, said she may leave Hong Kong if the city\u2019s freedoms are extinguished.\n\nSome protesters spray-painted the word \u201cresist\u201d along a sidewalk.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking of my kid\u2019s future. For the sake of our freedom, there\u2019s nothing we\u2019re afraid of,\u201d Feng Yiucheng said through his black mask as he handed out bottles of water to marchers from his van, accompanied by his wife and 2-year-old son.\n\nThe protests were sparked in early June by a bill that would have sent criminal suspects to stand trial in mainland China, but have since snowballed into an anti-China movement. Many peaceful demonstrators say violence is the only way for young protesters to force the government to bend to clamors for greater democratic rights and other demands.\n\nThe shooting of a 14-year-old boy Friday night \u2014 the second protest victim of police gunfire \u2014 stoked fears of more bloody confrontations. An 18-year-old protester was shot at close range by a riot officer on Tuesday. He was charged with rioting and assaulting police, while the younger teen was arrested.", "description": "HONG KONG (AP) \u2014 Shouting \"Wearing a mask is not a crime,\" tens of thousands of protesters marched in central Hong Kong on Sunday, as a court rejected a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/06/bf1022_hong-kong-protests-81545-protesters-throw-tear-gas-police-in-hong-kong-sunday-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
