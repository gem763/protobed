ICE placed a detainer on Gomez-Cervantes, and his next court date is October 28.\n\nAlso in custody is illegal alien Rigoberto Murcia-Martinez who was arrested on April 16 and charged with three counts of indecent liberties with a child, two counts of statutory sex offense with a child, and statutory rape of a child. ICE placed a detainer on Murcia-Martinez and, at the time of his arrest, he had already been ordered deported.\n\nIllegal alien Jasmine Villareal has been in Mecklenburg County custody since March 21 when she was arrested and charged with three counts of trafficking opium or heroin and possession of a stolen firearm. Her next court date is November 5.\n\n\u201cThe only persons protected by these misguided policies are criminals as the only way a person is subject to a detainer is if they\u2019ve been arrested for a crime beyond anything to do with their immigration status,\u201d Acting ICE Director Matt Albence said in a statement.\n\nIn August, Mecklenburg County officials released a 33-year-old illegal alien from Honduras who had been charged with first-degree rape and accused of multiple child sex crimes.\n\nA July report by the Epoch Times noted research by North Carolinians For Immigration Reform and Enforcement (NCFIRE.info), which states that in the last one and a half years, more than 330 illegal aliens have been charged with nearly 1,200 child sex crimes in North Carolina. Over the last four and a half years, the NCFIRE\u2019s research states that an average of 34 illegal aliens in North Carolina are charged every month with child sex crimes.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
