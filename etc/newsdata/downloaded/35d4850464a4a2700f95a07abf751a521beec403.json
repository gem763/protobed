Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearing last year.\n\nNine of the Republican members on the Senate Judiciary Committee sent letter to Attorney General William Barr and FBI Director Christopher Wray asking for an update to the committee\u2019s four referrals for criminal investigation.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful to citizens who come forward with relevant information in good faith, even if they are not entirely sure about the accuracy of that information. But, when individuals intentionally mislead the committee, they divert important committee resources during time-sensitive investigations and materially impede its work. Such acts are not only unfair; they are potentially illegal,\u201d said the letter.\n\nDuring the course of the probe into Justice Kavanaugh after Christine Blasey Ford came public with allegations of sexual misconduct against him, a few others came forward with different complaints, in an attempt to curtail the nominee\u2019s confirmation to the court.\n\nJustice Kavanaugh, though, vehemently denied any misconduct and the allegations were never corroborated.\n\nThe committee staff discovered at least four individuals had falsified their claims, suggesting they\u2019ve violated the law by making false statements to Congress, obstructing a Congressional investigation and committing conspiracy.\n\nThe letter asked for the Justice Department and FBI to respond to their inquiry by Oct. 21.\n\nThe Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment from The Washington Times.\n\nTwo of the individuals the committee wanted referred for criminal conduct was lawyer Michael Avenatti and his client Julie Swetnick for falsifying information to the committee in a claim she had witnessed the nominee and a group of his friends getting women drunk at a college party and gang-raping them.\n\nAnother individual, Judy Munro-Leighton, claimed in a letter the nominee and a friend had raped her. But when questioned by the committee staff, she admitted it was not true and said the false claim was made to \u201cgrab attention.\u201d\n\nThe final individual, who the committee referred for prosecution, made a false allegation that the nominee assaulted a friend on a boat in Rhode Island in 1985. That individual eventually admitted the claim was not true and apologized on social media.\n\nThe letter was signed by Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, Sen. Chuck Grassley, Sen. Ted Cruz, Sen. Mike Crapo, Sen. John Cornyn, Sen. Thom Tillis, Sen. John Kennedy, Sen. Mike Lee, and Sen. Marsha Blackburn.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
