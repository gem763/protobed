Though born in Bonn, Germany in 1770, he moved to the Austrian capital when he was in his early 20s, and then spent the rest of his 56 years changing the course of Western music from the city on the Danube. A quirky, cantankerous celebrity in his own time, he premiered his groundbreaking symphonies and concertos in Vienna\u2019s grand palaces, escaped the summer heat in what are now its sleepy suburbs, and moved around between dozens of supposedly squalid apartments that sprawl across much of the city.\n\nHis life story, marked by debilitating deafness and unrequited love, is the stuff of legend here, and even residents who couldn\u2019t tell a Beethoven concerto from a Brahms sonata may know that he once penned a despairing, near-suicidal note at the hilltop spa of Heiligenstadt, now a fancy neighborhood at the city\u2019s northern edges, or that he spent a few pleasant months in once-remote, woodsy M\u00f6dling, now an industrial exurb.\n\nBeethoven\u2019s summer sojourns ended with a return to the big city, and Vienna still revs up its cultural season with fall concert programs featuring the Bonn transplant, whose autumnal late string quartets seem to set just the right tone. Next year is the 250th anniversary of Beethoven\u2019s birth, and the city will take a year-long look at his legacy, but you don\u2019t need an anniversary to follow in his footsteps. Here, the essential stops.\n\nBeethoven\u2019s Vienna Following the great composer around his hometown In Vienna\u2019s historic center, Ludwig van Beethoven spent several years in a fifth-floor, 18th-century walk-up, high above the city\u2019s medieval fortifications, in a building known as the Pasqualati House.

Daniel Gebhart de Koekkoek for The Wall Street Journal\n\nThe Crash Pads\n\nBeethoven moved nearly 70 times while living in Vienna. Two of his former homes are open to the public, and many more are marked with commemorative plaques.\n\nHigh above Vienna\u2019s historic center, at the edge of the hilly Vienna Woods, the city\u2019s Beethoven Museum, is housed in a onetime bakery complex dating back to the late Middle Ages, with an 18th-century annex containing a small apartment where Beethoven spent the summer of 1802. While living here, he composed his tragic \u201cTempest\u201d piano sonata and began work on his 3rd Symphony, the \u201cEroica.\u201d\n\n\u201c \u2018The Beethoven Museum is outfitted with relics, including a lock of his own hair and a death-mask.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe museum is the place to view a trajectory of the composer\u2019s life in Vienna. He first made his mark in the city as a precocious pianist-for-hire in the 1790s, growing in stature until his death in 1827, when upward of 20,000 Viennese turned out to witness his funeral procession.\n\nOutfitted with relics\u2014including a lock of his hair, and a death mask once belonging to pianist-composer Franz Liszt\u2014the museum narrates the story with the help of vintage objects, like a collection of the era\u2019s ear trumpets. In what is believed to be the rooms he stayed in, up a half-flight of stairs from the quaint courtyard, Beethoven wrote his Heiligenstadt Testament, an unsent letter to his brothers, which described his fears of growing deaf while reaffirming his belief in the sanctity of his music. \u201cI find the museum very emotional,\u201d said Andris Nelsons, music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, \u201cIt\u2019s like meeting Beethoven\u2019s ghost.\u201d (6 Probusgasse, wienmuseum.at).\n\nThe Beethoven Museum.

In what is believed to be Beethoven\u2019s former apartment, the city\u2019s Vienna Museum oversees a second space, with its own treasure trove of Beethoven memorabilia and ephemera, from a music stand to a spare sugar tin. Beethoven\u2019s two stays here\u2014from 1804 to 1808, and later from 1810 to 1814\u2014coincided with his monumental revisions of his only opera, \u201cFidelio,\u201d and arguably his greatest triumph in his own lifetime, the 1813 premier of a short orchestral piece, \u201cWellington\u2019s Victory,\u201d in honor of a British triumph during the Napoleonic Wars, and paradoxically among his lesser-known works today.\n\nThe Pasqualati House brings early-19th-century Vienna back to life, with a special installation devoted to Beethoven\u2019s patrons. Visitors can also get a crash course in Beethoven\u2019s pained crushes on noble ladies, one of whom is believed to be his so-called Immortal Beloved, the mysterious addressee of yet another unsent letter (8 M\u00f6lker Bastei, wien.info).\n\nEroica Hall. Photo: Daniel Gebhart de Koekkoek for The Wall Street Journal\n\nHis Music, Then and Now\n\nBeethoven\u2019s career came during a transitional period in the history of musical performance, when private ensembles were just about to give way to professional orchestras. His Eroica Symphony is now typically played by upward of 70 musicians, for an audience of several thousand. But it was first performed in what amounts to a large living room, in the Vienna palace of Prince Joseph Franz von Lobkowitz, by around 30 musicians for an audience of 100.\n\nMartin Haselb\u00f6ck, an Austrian conductor, is leading the way back to the Vienna of Beethoven\u2019s time with his period-instrument ensemble, the Orchester Wiener Akademie. It performs Beethoven works in their original settings, including the ornate Eroica Hall, as it was later christened, in the Palais Lobkowitz, now Vienna\u2019s Theater Museum. Modern instruments played in halls with state-of-the-art acoustics may impress, admits Mr. Haselb\u00f6ck, but the more compact spaces that Beethoven knew can have a much stronger impact. \u201cWhen you hear Beethoven played in the Palais Lobkowitz,\u201d he said, \u201cyou feel the music under your skin.\u201d (2 Lobkowitzplatz, theatermuseum.at)\n\nKlimt\u2019s Beethoven Frieze Photo: Daniel Gebhart de Koekkoek for The Wall Street Journal\n\nMonumental Tokens\n\nBeethoven was certainly famous when he died, but his posthumous fame turned him for a time into something nearly superhuman. For a glimpse of the cult he inspired, take a stroll to Beethovenplatz, near the southern tip of the First District, where his enormous monument, unveiled in 1883, suggests a cross between a late Roman emperor and an early Christian martyr.\n\nIn 1901, Gustav Klimt created one of his masterpieces in honor of the composer. The Beethoven Frieze, a cycle of swooning nudes, shows art redeeming the sufferings of life, with the spirit of the composer presiding over the gilded spectacle. It\u2019s on permanent display in Vienna\u2019s Secession building (12 Friedrichstrasse, secession.at).\n\nBeethoven\u2019s remains were exhumed a few times before reaching Vienna\u2019s Zentralfriedhof cemetery, the final resting place of the city\u2019s creative geniuses, in 1888. His obelisk tombstone, with a gilded bas-relief of a lyre, marks the spot (234 Simmeringer Hauptstrasse).\n\nMaster Plan\n\nNext year, Vienna celebrates Beethoven\u2019s big birthday with a series of concerts and exhibits. A few highlights:\n\nIn honor of the 250th anniversary of Ludwig van Beethoven\u2019s birth, Vienna in mounting a year-long shindig, with concert venues, opera houses and museums ready to tempt visitors with everything from original-instrument performances to contemporary artists weighing in on the composer\u2019s genius.\n\nOn Feb. 1, the Vienna State Opera will mount a rare staging of the first version of \u201cFidelio,\u201d Beethoven\u2019s only opera. On March 16, the work\u2019s second version gets its own airing at Theater an der Wien, the 18th-century opera house and concert hall, with Oscar-winning Austrian actor Christoph Waltz, known for his roles in the films of Quentin Tarantino, set to direct. In April, back at the State Opera, the third and best-known version, in a classic staging dating back to the 1970s, will delight traditionalists (wiener-staatsoper.at, theater-wien.at/en/home).\n\nIn mid-February, the Orchester Wiener Akademie will play Beethoven piano concertos on period instruments in the Baroque main hall of the Palais Nieder\u00f6sterreich, a centuries-old complex where concerts were given during Beethoven\u2019s lifetime (wienerakademie.at).\n\nStarting on March 25, Vienna\u2019s Kunsthistorisches Museum, known for its Old Masters paintings, will open \u201cBeethoven \u2013 The Exhibition,\u201d a multi-media show featuring works in several genres, created over several centuries (khm.at).\n\nLater in the spring, at the Musikverein, home of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, Latvian-born, Swiss-based conductor Andris Nelsons will helm a full cycle of Beethoven symphonies between May 23 \u2013 June 7 (musikverein.at).", "description": "The essential sites to learn about the life, times and heartbreaks of the great composer, from relic-filled apartments to grand palaces to the concert halls where you\u2019ll \u2018feel the music under your skin.\u2019 Plus: Next year\u2019s Beethoven-mania.", "authors": ["J.S.
