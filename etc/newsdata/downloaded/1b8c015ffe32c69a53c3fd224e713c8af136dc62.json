Purolator is also testing electric cargo bikes and self-service parcel lockers in downtown Toronto.\n\nThe plans are aimed at helping Purolator shift from its focus on business-to-business parcel delivery as consumer demand drives more retail sales online.\n\n\u201cAll the things we\u2019re doing with the billion-dollar investment are designed to handle e-commerce down the road,\u201d Purolator Chief Executive John Ferguson said in an interview. \u201cAbout 70% of our business is still what we call core B2B and it\u2019s growing. The e-commerce is about 30% but growing faster.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nPurolator, which is majority-owned by Canada Post Corp., generated $1.42 billion in revenue last year and nearly $124 million in profit, up 13.4% and 31.7%, respectively, from 2017.\n\nRetail e-commerce spending in Canada is projected to reach $49.8 billion this year, up 21.1% from 2018 and accounting for about 10% of all retail sales, research firm eMarketer estimates.\n\nThe growth of e-commerce has challenged margins at U.S. parcel carriers United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp. Ferrying packages to homes and apartment buildings is more costly than business-to-business deliveries, where drivers might unload dozens of packages per stop.\n\nDelivering e-commerce orders in Canada tends to take longer and cost more than in the U.S., where delivery companies can reach much of the population in two days or less by placing inventory in warehouses near big population centers.\n\nAs Purolator takes on more business-to-consumer volumes, \u201cchances are it\u2019s not going to be as profitable as the B2B,\u201d said Marc Wulfraat, president of Montreal-based logistics consulting firm MWPVL International Inc. \u201cWe see that happening in the States.\u201d\n\nCanada\u2019s rugged geography and a population that is largely concentrated along the U.S. border \u201ccreates a very expensive supply chain,\u201d Mr. Wulfraat said. It typically takes two days or more to reach smaller towns, he said, and population centers beyond the Great Lakes region are spread out, making it expensive to stock warehouses nearby.\n\n\u201cMost Canadian businesses will opt for cheap\u201d and provide free shipping through Canada Post, Mr. Wulfraat said. \u201cThe whole notion of e-commerce on steroids, where everyone has to have it right now, that\u2019s not here yet. People are still thrilled when they get it in two days.\u201d\n\nPart of Purolator\u2019s solution is a planned 430,000-square-foot automated hub in Toronto intended to triple capacity as customers like Amazon.com Inc. and furniture retailer Wayfair Inc. field more online orders from Canadian consumers.\n\nMr. Ferguson, the Purolator CEO, said online orders have added packages to the company\u2019s network, which includes more than 170 terminals in Canada and 30 in the U.S. Purolator is also pursuing more business from midsize U.S. e-commerce businesses looking to increase their reach in Canada.\n\nMr. Ferguson said Purolator had benefited from Amazon\u2019s push to narrow the delivery window for Prime members to one day.\n\nHowever, Amazon, which has been handling more of its own logistics as it tries to tamp down shipping costs, is building out a network of warehouses in Canada. The company has opened seven buildings there, with another five under construction, according to MWPVL.\n\nAn Amazon spokeswoman didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nMr. Ferguson said, \u201cThere\u2019s still a strong need for us,\u201d although he expects Amazon will want to control more of its Canadian transportation. \u201cWe\u2019ve decided to lean in to Amazon\u2026. And we think there\u2019s enough complexity to Canada and enough need, and their growth is still super high, for us to be a player in there for some years to come.\u201d\n\nWrite to Jennifer Smith at jennifer.smith@wsj.com", "description": "Canadian parcel-delivery company Purolator is retooling its operations to meet growing e-commerce demand in a country with big hurdles to fast, cheap delivery.", "authors": ["Jennifer Smith", "Jennifer.Smith Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-121785/social", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
