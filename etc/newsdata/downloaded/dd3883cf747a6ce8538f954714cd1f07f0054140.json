You can form your own view.

We have to be witness to research and development in the sphere of centrifuges; all kinds of new centrifuges.\u201d\n\nCentrifuges are machines that refine gaseous uranium ore into fissile material which can be used as fuel for civilian power plants or, if enriched to higher levels, material for nuclear weapons. The potential expansion of centrifuge research and development, set to begin on Friday, is Iran\u2019s third downgrading of its commitment to the JCPOA.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

French President Emmanuel Macron has sought to prevent an outright collapse of the deal by offering Iran a $15 billion line of credit, but has so far failed to convince the administration of Donald Trump not to sabotage it.\n\nMr Rouhani said that Iran would announce a fresh escalation in two months if the remaining JCPOA partners - including the UK, France, Germany, China, and Russia - fail to come up with a mechanism to improve Iran\u2019s economy, which is mired in recession.\n\nIt\u2019s significant that they would do more research.
