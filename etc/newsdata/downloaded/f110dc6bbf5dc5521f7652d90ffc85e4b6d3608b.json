Forbes Associate Editor Chase Peterson-Withorn said Trump\u2019s net worth is down $400 million since he took office.\n\n\u201cHe had said a few weeks ago that he was losing $3 billion to $5 billion,\u201d Withorn told Yahoo Finance\u2019s On the Move. \u201c$5 billion is more money than he's ever been worth. He's not losing that much money.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s son Eric is running the Trump Organization while his dad is in office. The younger Trump, appeared at the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit and said, \u201cThe second my father looked like he was going to win, we went and we turned off every single deal that we were doing overseas that wasn\u2019t already, like, inked.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot exactly,\u201d said Withorn. \u201cLike a lot of things with the Trumps, it\u2019s you know there\u2019s some truth to it but generally no.\u201d\n\nWithorn said the Trumps are not closing big new deals overseas but are still profiting from licensing agreements in places like Dubai and Turkey while selling property in places like the Dominican Republic.\n\n\u201cThey sell things to foreign buyers through LLCs and things like that. So you know, that\u2019s a foreign deal,\u201d Withorn said.\n\nTrump\u2019s real estate holdings\n\nForbes recently published an article on Trump\u2019s definitive net worth. It calculated almost half of the president\u2019s fortune is tied up in New York City real estate, estimated to be worth $1.5 billion.\n\nTrump International Hotel & Tower in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., March 18, 2019. REUTERS/Kamil Krzaczynski More\n\nTrump\u2019s real estate holdings outside New York City, including the Trump International Hotel & Tower in Chicago and the Trump National Hotel in Washington D.C., are valued at $660 million, while clubs and golf courses, including Mar-a-Lago in Florida and Trump Turnberry in Scotland, are valued at $590 million.\n\nBut Withorn said, \u201cThe Trump brand, from a business standpoint, has become toxic to a level that people just generally just want to stay away right now.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s most recent financial disclosure reveals Trump\u2019s businesses in 2018 generated $434 million in revenue from all sources but that was down from the $452 million reported in 2017.\n\n\u201cThe place where the brand has really gotten hit the hardest is really not the biggest business of the president\u2019s but it\u2019s really the branding of mattresses and ties and shirts,\u201d Withorn said.\n\n\u201cThat was worth maybe $15 million or $20 million to the president. It is worth basically nothing today,\u201d according to Withorn.\n\nBut don\u2019t dismiss Trump\u2019s ability to make a deal when he leaves office. Withorn said reporters from Forbes have spoken with Trump\u2019s old partners about deals that fell through in the early days of his campaign to become president.\n\n\u201cThose partners straight up told us, you know, we\u2019re ready and so excited to do a deal with him. The second he gets out of office, the second he\u2019s ready, you know great,\u201d according to Withorn.\n\nAdam Shapiro is co-anchor of Yahoo Finance On the Move.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "Forbes estimates President Donald Trump's wealth at $3.1 billion dollars but the possibility of  impeachment could cost the Trump Organization millions of dollars.", "authors": ["Adam Shapiro"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/c2jN0GeNCt7ba08Axbl.vQ--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/0cf57580-ef3c-11e9-bfbf-7059cf2cd25d", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
