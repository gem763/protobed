It employs around 91,000 staff at 500 stores in the America, Canada and Britain.\n\nOxfam interviewed workers on farms and plantations in the United States, India and Brazil used by many of the big grocery chains. It found poverty pay, harsh working conditions, and gender discrimination commonplace on the farms and plantations that supply tea, fruit and vegetables to the world\u2019s supermarkets.\n\nOxfam said: \u201cIn North East Brazil, researchers found evidence of poverty among harvest workers on grape, melon and mango farms. Farmhands also reported developing allergies and serious skin diseases as a result of working with pesticides and other chemicals without adequate protection. The farms supply Lidl, Sainsbury\u2019s, Tesco, and Whole Foods.\u201d\n\nNot all supermarket chains cooperated with the study, Oxfam said. Walmart WMT, +0.28% and Ralphs owner Kroger KR, -1.96%, wouldn\u2019t decline or confirm to Oxfam whether the cited farms were in fact among their suppliers.\n\nIn a statement, Walmart said: \u201cWe appreciate the Oxfam research and report, which sheds light on important issues throughout the food retailing industry and the global supply chains that support it, highlighting areas for improvement as well as recognizing the good work we are doing.\u201d Kroger did not respond with a comment.\n\nOxfam interviewed workers on 50 tea estates in Assam, India revealing that cholera and typhoid are common because workers lack access to toilets and safe drinking water. Half the workers questioned receive \u2018Below Poverty Line\u2019 ration cards from the government because wages are so poor.\n\nReferring to an earlier ranking of markets, a Tesco TSCO, +0.69% spokesperson said: \u201cThis is the second year in a row that Tesco has been assessed by Oxfam as doing most, of all major supermarkets globally, to ensure human rights are respected in food supply chains. We know there is always more to do and we are working . . . to improve wages in the key produce, tea and clothing sectors and ensure working conditions are fair.\u201d\n\nBoth Sainsbury\u2019s SBRY, +1.43% and Lidl forwarded a comment from the British Retail Consortium industry body which said: \u201cOur members are working hard to address existing injustices and continue to collaborate internationally with charities and business groups on this vital issue.\u201d", "description": "The charity claims that laborers that supply Whole Foods reported working up to 14 hours a day in \u201coppressive heat with few rest breaks,\u201d and often with...", "authors": ["Rupert Steiner", "Bureau Chief"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT020_Oxfamu_ZG_20191010055614.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
