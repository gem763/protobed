And check to see if this is really what people want. Which is why I back a People\u2019s Vote.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nLabour-voting Carragher's support was released by the People's Vote campaign ahead of a march in London on October 19.\n\nThe date is the legal deadline for Boris Johnson to request a three-month delay to Brexit in order to rule out no-deal on October 31.\n\nCarragher - who will join the London march - said Britain should \"look back at what we have learnt since 2016 and be able to give an opinion on where we are now in 2019.\"\n\nHe added: \"We have seen the impact of Brexit on jobs, on medicines, on food and on farming.\n\n\"The impact of No Deal on the North of England. That it will hurt those on low incomes most. That the NHS will not get all the money it was promised.\"\n\n(Image: Hollie Adams)\n\nCarragher hit out at Brexit hours after the 2016 referendum result, tweeting: \"A vote for Farage, Boris & a recession well done to the over 50's for thinking of the future!\"\n\nHe was one of a string of celebrities who sponsored more than 30 coaches to a People's Vote march in October last year.\n\nAnd in January he told the BBC's Pienaar's Politics: \"I was disappointed with the result a couple of years ago, and I still believe it would be the wrong decision if we finally leave the EU.\n\n\u201cPeople don't like to admit maybe they were wrong, who knows? We'll see in the future, the future will tell us that.\"\n\nBut the People's Vote campaign said this is the first time he has fully backed a referendum.\n\nCarragher made more than 500 appearances for the Reds as a one-club man, retiring in 2013 after a 17-year career which saw him win the Champions League.\n\nHe has previously said he voted Labour , and donated \u00a310,000 to Andy Burnham's Labour leadership campaign in 2010.", "description": "The Liverpool veteran says we need a 'People's Vote' to stop the 'dangers of no deal'", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Getty Images", "Hollie Adams"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20515174.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Aston-Villa-v-Everton-FC-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
