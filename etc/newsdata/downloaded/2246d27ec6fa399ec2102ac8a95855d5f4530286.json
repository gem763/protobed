He said he had run away and needed help, and that he had never been to school. Then we called the police.\u201d\n\nRTV Drenthe states police attended the seemingly abandoned farmhouse to discover a secret door in the living room, which led to a staircase and a hidden room sheltering the siblings and the ill man.\n\nThe apparent escapee is thought to be the eldest of the siblings, with the youngest being between 16 and 18 years of age.\n\nThe siblings and the older man, who is believed to have suffered a stroke, are now receiving medical treatment.\n\nRTV Drenthe reports the family appears to have had little contact with the outside world in recent years, and may have subsisted on vegetables and livestock grown in a small yard adjacent the farmhouse.\n\nPolice state it is unclear if they lived there voluntarily, but today confirmed the arrest of a 58-year-old man who rented the farm. He is not believed to be the father of the siblings.\n\nNewspaper Algemeen Dagblad published speculation the group was living at the premises to await the end of time, but local mayor Roger de Groot said authorities currently have as many questions as the public.\n\nAfter confirming police discovered the makeshift shelter, de Groot said \u201cfor the moment, the police have a lot of unanswered questions.\u201d\n\nInvestigations are ongoing.", "description": "Dutch police confirmed a 58-year-old man has been arrested in relation to the discovery.", "authors": ["David Adams"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/ruinerwold-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
