Giuliani later confirmed to The Washington Post that he was still representing Trump.\n\n\u201cIs it a bad sign when President Trump starts to say you have to ask the attorney and maybe that\u2019s not his attorney any more, for that attorney?\u201d Melber asked Vance.\n\n\u201cTrump always has tells, right?\u201d Vance replied. \u201cWe know that when he says a man came up to me and said, \u2018sir,\u2019 that we\u2019re about to hear something that\u2019s not true. Here we see the classic Trump throwing someone close to him under the bus.\u201d\n\nVance later expressed hope Giuliani would now \u201ctake advantage, if it is true he is under investigation, of the opportunity maybe to achieve some sort of renewed good faith with the American people by coming forward and telling the truth.\u201d\n\nCheck out the full interview above.\n\nCNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper also made a similar point about Trump distancing himself in the segment, below:\n\nRelated...\n\nGeorge Conway Cracks There's Really Only 1 Way The GOP Will Turn On Donald Trump\n\nDonald Trump Belittles Beyonc\u00e9, Jay-Z, Bruce Springsteen And Invokes Fans' Fury\n\nAnother Day, Another Bonkers Typo From Donald Trump\n\nAlso on HuffPost\n\nLove HuffPost?
