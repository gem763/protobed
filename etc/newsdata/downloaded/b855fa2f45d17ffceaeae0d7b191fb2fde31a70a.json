(Photo: ISIS propaganda video)\n\nIslamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is dead after U.S.-led raid in Syria\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Sunday that terrorist leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, perhaps the world's most wanted man, was killed during a special operations raid over the weekend. \"Last night the United States brought the world's No. 1 terrorist leader to justice,\" Trump said at the White House. Al-Baghdadi led the extremist organization known as the Islamic State, also known as ISIS. Trump said he died after running from a house into a dead-end tunnel while being chased by United States Special Operations commandos in Syria. Al-Baghdadi detonated a suicide vest that killed him and three of his children, Trump said. Al-Baghdadi is the highest-ranking terrorist to be killed or captured since the death of Osama bin Laden in 2011.\n\nThe White House released photos of President Donald Trump watching from the Situation Room as ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was killed in a U.S. raid.

Katie Hill, D-Calif., faced with allegations she had a sexual relationship with a staff member, announced her resignation on Sunday. In a statement posted to Twitter, Hill called her resignation \"the hardest thing I have ever had to do, but I believe it is the best thing for my constituents, my community, and our country.\" The House Ethics Committee announced Wednesday it had launched an investigation into allegations Hill engaged in a sexual relationship with a staff member. The allegation of Hill's relationship with one of her staffers was first published by conservative website RedState.com. The site also posted a nude photo purportedly of Hill with another person, along with a second allegation that Hill had a relationship with an unidentified campaign staffer.\n\nAt least 2 dead after Texas off-campus shooting; suspect at large\n\nTwo people were dead, 14 were injured and a manhunt was underway Sunday after a gunman opened fire at a Halloween party not far from Texas A&M University-Commerce, igniting \"complete chaos\" as hundreds of panicked partygoers scrambled for cover. Hunt County Sheriff Randy Meeks said the shooting took place at The Party Venue in Greenville, around 50 miles northeast of Dallas, where at least 750 people at the party were celebrating homecoming weekend at Texas A&M University-Commerce. No suspect had been identified, but Meeks said that he does not believe the shooter poses an immediate danger to the general public.\n\nAuthorities work the scene after a deadly shooting in Greenville, Texas, on Sunday, Oct. 27, 2019.

The state\u2019s largest utility shut off power to an estimated 2.3 million people starting Saturday evening in an effort to avoid setting off fires. But the precautionary move did not prevent the Kincade Fire from igniting Wednesday. The blaze has now grown to 30,000 acres and was only 10% contained as of Sunday morning, forcing authorities to impose mandatory evacuations for 180,000 residents in Sonoma County. Concerns that the winds could spread the fire across a major highway prompted the evacuation orders covering parts of Santa Rosa, a city of 175,000 that was devastated by a wildfire two years ago.\n\nFirefighters survey Soda Rock Winery as it begins to burn during the Kincade fire in Healdsburg, California on October 27, 2019.

A group of Mexican mothers searching for missing loved ones discovered 27 bodies in the mass grave last week near the beach resort town of Puerto Pe\u00f1asco, commonly known as Rocky Point, according to state officials. More bodies were uncovered Saturday. At least two of the bodies were buried recently, while the remaining were largely skeletal remains, indicating they had been there longer, the state said. Lupita Ordu\u00f1o, spokeswoman for the state's attorney general's office, said that it was too early to speculate why the bodies were buried.\n\nWomen with the Mexican group Searching Mothers of Sonora, joined by state investigators, dig up a mass grave with the remains of 13 people on Oct. 24, 2019, outside the popular beach town of Rocky Point.

Oklahoma nearly erased a 25-point deficit in the fourth quarter but ultimately lost 48-41 to Kansas State for its first loss of the season. But it might be too early to write them off as a College Football Playoff contender. Jim Harbaugh and Michigan got on track with a demolition of Notre Dame, and Ohio State continued to roll looking like a No. 1 team with its rout over Wisconsin. And somehow, Kansas got its first conference win under Les Miles and sixth for the decade. Here\u2019s a look at the other big winners and losers from the week, as well as our forecast of the Football Four, which features two SEC teams. Finally, after LSU\u2019s win against Auburn, it is now No. 2 on the latest Amway Coaches Poll.\n\nWorld Series all tied up: Scherzer scratched from pivotal Game 5\n\nIn a World Series dominated by the away team, the Houston Astros took Games 3 and 4 in the nation's capital to force a 2-2 tie. Astros starter Zack Greinke was sharp in Friday night's affair, allowing one run on seven hits, while Alex Bregman delivered the knockout blow Saturday night, a grand slam to put the Astros firmly in front, 8-1. Washington Nationals ace Max Scherzer was the scheduled starter for a key Game 5 Sunday night, but was scratched due to neck and back spasms. Right-hander Joe Ross is scheduled to replace him.\n\nAstros infielders celebrate after Yuli Gurriel made a diving play to end a threat in the sixth. (Photo: Geoff Burke, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nP.S.
