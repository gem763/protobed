In the AFL-mad state, the game they play in jail is very much an Off-Broadway pastime.\n\nThe last Liberal treasurer from Bleak City, Peter Costello, was No.1 ticket holder of Essendon Football Club, as was Labor finance minister Lindsay Tanner. And of course Julia Gillard occupied the post at the Western Bulldogs.\n\nBut as a Carlton FC supporter, Frydenberg would have to dislodge Sam Smorgon of the industrial dynasty that began in the 1920s with a butcher\u2019s shop in the inner-Melbourne suburb, who\u2019s held the position since 1997 (almost as long as the Blues have gone without a premiership).\n\nStill, you\u2019d have to like Frydenberg\u2019s chances of getting there eventually.
