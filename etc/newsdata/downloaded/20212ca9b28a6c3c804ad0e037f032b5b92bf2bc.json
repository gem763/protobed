Announced last month, Stage Fright marks Slate\u2019s very first comedy special, and in it she explores the titular problem that\u2019s made her career performing in front of tons of people a bit of a struggle. Similar to Gary Gulman\u2019s recent HBO special The Great Depresh, Stage Fright is a mix of Slate performing live as well as documentary footage of her with her family at home and some old home videos of her as a kid. In the trailer Netflix released today, Slate opens up about how much stage fright has plagued her over the years, especially when people try to talk her out of it: \u201cThe worst thing is like \u2018Just be yourself!\u2019 \u2019Cause I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, okay! You should see how many selves there are in my psyche.\u2019\u201d Another solid description of living life that we can all relate to: \u201cI feel like a turtle that just got roller skates and realized that things can be fast. I\u2019m just like, \u2018Aaahhh!\u2019\u201d Thankfully, Slate also offers a very wise reminder to balance out all the anxiety: \u201cWho gives a shit?! Death will come for us all. I\u2019m dressed for it.\u201d Stage Fright heads to Netflix in just a little over two weeks on Tuesday, October 22.\n\nRelated", "description": "Netflix released the trailer for comedian Jenny Slate\u2019s new special \u2018Stage Fright,\u2019 which premieres on October 22.", "authors": ["Megh Wright"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/07/07-jenny-slate.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
