Binford Chair of Corporate Citizenship, is recommending \"Factfulness\" as a relatively new read this semester for his MBA students. \"In this book, Rosling and his co-authors argue that most people have an overly pessimistic view of the world,\" he explains. \"Markets in developing countries are actually becoming richer and more sophisticated at an astonishing pace. Students and business executives who recognize the world for what it is will in the long run be significantly more successful than those who don't.\"\n\nCochran also recommends to his students the 2011 blockbuster, \"Thinking Fast and Slow\" by Daniel Kahneman.\n\n\"The central focus of Kahneman's book is the proposition that humans have two modes of thinking,\" says Cochran. \"'System 1' is fast, intuitive, and emotional. 'System 2' is our ability to reflect, reason, and reach considered judgments, which makes humans unique. The point of having MBA students read this book is to encourage them to learn when they have to engage System 2: When they have to pause, think, and calculate.\"", "description": "Among the top choices for professors at Stanford, Harvard, Kellogg, and more are \"Who Moved My Cheese?,\" \"Good to Great,\" and \"Bad Blood.\"", "authors": ["Robin Madell"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d373cab100a24560454d285-2732-1366.jpg"}
