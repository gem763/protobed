USA TODAY\n\nThe Washington Nationals are heading to the World Series \u2014 and they're taking an unlikely anthem with them.\n\n\"Baby Shark,\" the popular children's song that miraculously cracked the Billboard Hot 100 chart earlier this year, has become a rallying cry of sorts for the Nationals and their fans this season after reserve outfielder Gerardo Parra began using it as his walkup song in mid-June.\n\nParra, whom the Nationals signed after he was cut by the San Francisco Giants in May, was in a slump at the time, so he started searching for a new walkup song to switch things up. He landed on \"Baby Shark\" because his 2-year-old daughter, Aaliyah, \"loves that song.\"\n\n\"I tried merengue, reggaeton, hip-hop,\" Parra told reporters after he first used the song June 19, according to NBC Sports Washington. \"Then I said, \u2018You know what, I want to put in Baby Shark.\u2019 I'm happy for that.\"\n\nFINALLY WORLD SERIES-BOUND: Nationals put past failures behind them\n\nAnything more wild than a ballpark full of adults and children alike singing \"Baby Shark?\" pic.twitter.com/buK6yJQfKj \u2014 Cut4 (@Cut4) October 16, 2019\n\nThe song drew smiles (and eventually baby-shark hand-chomping motions) from Nationals fans, and inspired \"Parra Shark\" T-shirts. And the players have embraced it, too. After an extra-base hit, they'll often turn to the dugout and make the baby-shark motion with their hands in celebration.\n\n\"If the players get excited, we get excited,\" said Nationals fan Travis Eagleson, who attended Tuesday night's series-clinching win over the St. Louis Cardinals in a shark costume. \"If that\u2019s what they\u2019re about, that\u2019s what we\u2019re about.\"\n\nContributing: Chris Bumbaca", "description": "The popular children's song, 'Baby Shark,' has become a rallying cry of sorts for Nationals and fans this season thanks to outfielder Gerardo Parra.", "authors": ["Usa Today Sports", "Published A.M.
