They asked him if he knew whether Giuliani had any business connections with Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman.\n\nThose two men face federal charges for allegedly leveraging outsized political donations to Republican candidates and committees in order to advance their foreign business interests.\n\n'I was just asked whether I or any of my clients knew of any dealings that these two guys had with Giuliani,' McCallion told CNN. 'They were on the radar with regard to possible counterintelligence issues.'\n\nA Florida man wanted in a campaign finance case involving Parnas and Fruman is in federal custody after flying Wednesday to Kennedy Airport in New York City to turn himself in, federal authorities said.\n\nDavid Correia, 44, was named in an indictment with the two Giuliani associates and another man arrested last week on charges they made illegal contributions to politicians and a political action committee supporting President Donald Trump.\n\nGiuliani, a former New York City mayor, is Trump's personal lawyer.\n\nProsecutors said Correia worked with Parnas and Fruman in their company 'Fraud Guarantee,' which paid Giulani $500,000 in a 'retainer,' at the same time as the two Soviet-born naturalized citizens connected him to political figures in Ukraine.\n\nSurrender: David Correia, 44, a Florida businessman and former golf pro, gave himself up at JFK Airport in New York. He will appear in federal court in Manhattan on Thursday\n\nMeeting with associate: Correia and his associate Igor Fruman posed with Trump at an event held by the America First Action super PAC to which they are accused of funneling illegal cash\n\nBoth Parnas and Fruman have a history of business dealings with Giuliani. Prosecutors said that, among other things, the pair made campaign contributions with the intent of lobbying U.S. politicians to oust the country's ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nAt the time, Giuliani was trying to get Ukrainian officials to investigate the son of Trump's potential Democratic challenger, Joe Biden.\n\nCorreia is accused of conspired with the other defendants, including Ukrainian-born U.S. citizen Andrey Kukushkin, to make political donations to local and federal politicians in New York, Nevada and other states with the aim of trying to get support for a new recreational marijuana business.\n\nAll four defendants were expected to appear Thursday in federal court in Manhattan.\n\nA lawyer for Correia is not yet listed in court records. The Florida man is a former golf professional.\n\nGiuliani has said he had no knowledge of illegal donations and hadn't seen any evidence that Parnas and Fruman did anything wrong.\n\nCorreia is listed as the registered agent for a Florida corporation tied to a series of wire transfers prosecutors allege was part of an elaborate effort to hide the true source of funds used to make the donations.\n\nHe posed with then-Rep. Pete Sessions in a 2018 photo taken inside the Texas Republican's Capitol Hill office that Parnas posted on social media with the caption 'Hard at work !!'\n\nGangs all here: Correia was part of efforts by co-defendants Lev Parnas (center) and Igor Fruman (second from left) to leverage outsized political donations to Republican candidates and committees - one backing Trump - as part of an effort to advance their business interests. They paid Rudy Giuliani $500,000 as a 'retainer' but also helped him in Ukraine\n\n'Client': Giuliani was paid $500,000 by Fraud Guarantee, the company run by Parnas, with whom he breakfasted at the Trump Hotel in Washington D.C. in September,\n\nFederal grand jury target: Pete Sessions (center, between Parnas and Correia) is cooperating his attorney said. The federal indictment alleges he wrote a letter demanding Trump fire the ambassador to Ukraine after he received cash from the alleged foreign funding scheme. Correia boasted on social media about his Capitol Hill trip\n\nThe Associated Press reported last week that Sessions fits the description in the indictment of a congressman who prosecutors allege was part of a coordinated effort to remove the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nGiuliani had also been asking Ukrainian officials to dig up dirt on Biden and also pushed for the ouster of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch.\n\nProsecutors allege that Parnas urged a congressman to promote efforts to push out Yovanovitch around the same time that Parnas and Fruman committed to raising more than $20,000 for the politician.\n\nThe congressman wasn't identified in court papers, but the donations match campaign finance reports for Sessions, who lost his reelection bid in November. In May 2018, Parnas posted a photo of himself and his business partner David Correia - who was also named in the indictment - with Sessions in his Capitol Hill office, with the caption 'Hard at work!!'\n\nSessions spent 22 years in Congress becoming a powerful Republican voice and the muscle behind the GOP's House takeover of 2010.\n\nEarlier this month, Sessions announced an attempted comeback in his boyhood hometown of Waco, about 100 miles south of Dallas, running for a seat being vacated by Rep. Bill Flores, one of six Texas GOP congressmen retiring next year.\n\nA federal grand jury has subpoenaed Sessions for information about his interactions with Rudy Giuliani and several associates who were indicted last week.\n\nThe former lawmaker from Texas is cooperating with investigators and will turn over documents in the coming weeks, said Matt Mackowiak, a spokesman for Sessions.\n\nThe subpoena is part of an ongoing investigation based in New York that includes an inquiry into the business dealings of Giuliani, according to a person familiar with the probe. The person wasn't authorized to discuss the investigation publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nGiuliani, the former mayor of New York, is the personal attorney to President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, which first reported the Sessions subpoena, said it specifically sought documents related to Giuliani's business dealings in Ukraine and his efforts to oust the U.S. ambassador in Kyiv, as well as information about interactions between Sessions, Giuliani and the four arrested men.\n\nThe federal investigation comes as House Democrats pursue an impeachment inquiry into Trump's dealings with Ukraine, including a summertime phone call in which he pressed Ukraine's president to investigate baseless corruption allegations against Democrat Joe Biden.", "description": "David Correia, 44, of West Palm Beach, FL, was charged with two Giuliani associates and another man on charges of illegal contributions to a political action committee supporting Trump.", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/18/19798346-0-image-a-19_1571245676409.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
