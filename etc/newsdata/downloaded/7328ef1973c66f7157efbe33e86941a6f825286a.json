Federal police reported Thursday that they had detained a number of people with weapons who were seeking to \"disrupt\" Irreecha.\n\nSecurity is expected to be tight in Addis Ababa all weekend, and roads in the city centre were closed Saturday.", "description": "Members of Ethiopia's largest ethnic group chanted and waved flags as they gathered for the first time to celebrate their thanksgiving festival in the capital -- a city that prominent members of the group claim belongs to them.
