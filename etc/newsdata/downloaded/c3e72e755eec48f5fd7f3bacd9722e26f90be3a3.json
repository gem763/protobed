McCaughrean, Franck Schneider, Flickr/Wikimedia Commons)\n\nThe 2019 Physics Nobel Prize will be awarded half to James Peebles of Princeton University, and half jointly to Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz of the University of Geneva in Switzerland, for theoretical work improving our understanding of the universe and for the discovery of an exoplanet orbiting a Sun-like star, respectively.\n\nThe annual award is considered among the most prestigious for physicists, and this year\u2019s prize is devoted to \u201ccontributions to our understanding of the evolution of the universe and Earth\u2019s place in the cosmos,\u201d on the planetary and the universal scale, according to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\n\nToday\u2019s model to describe the universe in the most general sense is called \u039bCDM, representing a cosmological constant plus cold dark matter, and is the result of decades (or even centuries) of scientists, mathematicians and philosophers thinking about the night sky.\n\nMuch of it began with Albert Einstein\u2019s famed theory of general relativity, in which a mathematical term called the \u201ccosmological constant\u201d serves almost as a tuning knob to adjust the expansion of the universe, as well as Edwin Hubble\u2019s famous observation showing that the universe is expanding. Scientists have since realised that there are three core components that govern the universe\u2019s behaviour and fate: the least important part (regular matter and energy); some mysterious mass that determines the universe\u2019s structure, which we call dark matter; and an even more mysterious innate energy of space, called dark energy.\n\nMuch of the evidence that this theory correctly describes our universe comes from observations of the most distant radiation in the sky, called the cosmic microwave background, and theoretical work to understand this light.\n\nPeebles was one of the physicists whose work served to theorise the behaviour of this radiation and its tiny temperature fluctuations, to link it to the behaviour of dark matter and dark matter\u2019s serving as the universe\u2019s scaffolding, and to re-introduce the cosmological constant mathematics to explain dark energy. Observations of the universe have continued to verify Peebles\u2019 and other physicists\u2019 work.\n\nWhile Peebles helped us better understand the entire universe, Mayor and Queloz helped reveal our place in it. Scientist Otto Struve first proposed a way to look for planets around other stars based on the way they affected the starlight we see from Earth \u2014 a change to the stars\u2019 radial velocity, inducing a shift in the colour of its light, caused by an exoplanets\u2019 gravity.\n\nVarious groups worked to develop observational methods to hunt for these small shifts, but by 1994, scientists were only able to detect exoplanets around rotating neutron stars called pulsars, and they had found none around Sun-like stars.\n\nLate that year, Mayor and Queloz began to see small fluctuations in the light from the Sun-like star 51 Pegasi that repeated every four days. They observed this blinking using an instrument called a spectrograph attached to a relatively small telescope in France. They made their announcement in 1995: They had discovered a Jupiter-sized exoplanet orbiting close to the star. Though the findings was initially met with scepticism, astronomers have since uncovered thousands of exoplanets, proving Mayor and Queloz right.\n\nRetrospectively, the discovery sparked a new era of exoplanet hunting that continues to this day.\n\n\u201cThis was a combination \u2018greatest hits\u2019 award to Peebles for his numerous contributions to theoretical cosmology, and to Mayor and Queloz for a wonderful discovery,\u201d Brian Keating, physics professor at the University of California, San Diego and author of Losing the Nobel Prize, told Gizmodo in an email. But he noted that these prizes are the results of decades of work from other scientists, many of whom are dead and as such cannot win the prize \u2014 something he himself has railed against.\n\nSome physicists have already noted that this year\u2019s prize has reopened old wounds. Though Mayor and Queloz\u2019s work is important, a team of scientists led by David Latham had discovered a large companion to the star HD 114762 back in 1989. Also influential to early exoplanet research was Geoff Marcy, who sullied the field with his long history of sexual harassment.\n\nThough Peebles produced important work, plenty of other physicists produced equally important papers in developing modern cosmology. The prize reminded some that Vera Rubin died without receiving a Nobel Prize, which many physicists believe she deserved for her observational work bolstering the presence of a dark matter-induced anomaly in the universe (work analogous to that which earned three male physicists the Nobel Prize in 2011).\n\nIn many ways, a prize that only awards three people cannot capture the collaborative reality of the field, and promotes the incorrect idea that the best physics consists of a bunch of old (typically male) Einsteins working on their own.\n\n\u201cAny recognition that goes solely to one person or only two or three is a reflection of the politics of visibility in our discipline, which includes the way certain demographic groups have an easier time achieving scientific notability than others,\u201d Chanda Prescod-Weinstein, assistant professor in physics and core faculty in Women\u2019s Studies at the University of New Hampshire, told Gizmodo.\n\nIt is true that this years\u2019 winners made indispensable contributions to physics and cosmology. Physicists continue to hunt for something to explain dark matter and dark energy, while the American astronomy community may soon recommend the United States build a telescope sensitive enough to hunt for signs of life on distant exoplanets.\n\nBut, as I do every year, I\u2019ll remind you that maybe it\u2019s time we rethink the Nobel Prize and who it celebrates.", "description": "The 2019 Physics Nobel Prize will be awarded half to James Peebles of Princeton University, and half jointly to Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz of the University of Geneva in Switzerland, for theoretical work improving our understanding of the universe and for the discovery of an exoplanet orbiting a Sun-like star,...", "authors": ["Tegan Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/lrllezubqj8rt2dbjybz.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
