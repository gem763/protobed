I think we fielded four players who only have three or four caps each.\n\n\u201cWe put experience around them of course, but the most important thing was that those players got accustomed to playing international football at this level, against top players.\u201d\n\nTold you so, @NorthernIreland has had a decent few days! Now let\u2019s keep that momentum! #GAWA https://t.co/OjVEdKQUVQ \u2014 Jonathan Rea (@jonathanrea) October 14, 2019\n\nThe Czech Republic came into the game on the back of a surprise win over England on Friday, the Three Lions\u2019 first qualifying defeat in a decade, but the hosts could not build on that as coach Jaroslav Silhavy made 10 changes to his side \u2013 with Kral the only survivor.\n\nAfter Northern Ireland threatened to blow away his side in the opening 45 minutes, Silhavy made four substitutions at half-time to restore a number of senior players, and it made an immediate impact.\n\nHowever, they could not end an 18-year wait for a win over Northern Ireland, who won the last meeting between the teams in 2017 2-0 in Belfast following three 0-0 draws in recent fixtures.\n\n\u201cIt was a good result against a very good team,\u201d O\u2019Neill added. \u201cWe played them recently for Russia 2018 qualifying, we drew here 0-0 and won in Belfast, but I think this Czech team is stronger than that team.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve developed since then so this is a very positive result.\u201d", "description": "A brace from Paddy McNair and a Jonny Evans goal secured Northern Ireland an impressive away win.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/12/wire-19736974-1571137447-99_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
