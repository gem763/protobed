Four US Marine Corps MV-22 Ospreys conducted logistical assessments to non-governmental organizations (NGO), and the Coast Guard was also dispatched to help with search and rescue efforts.\n\nHurricane Dorian made landfall in the Bahamas as a Category 5 storm on Sunday and wreaked devastation for two days, killing at least 20 people. The storm sustained winds up to 185 mph, and gusts reached 225 mph.\n\nThousands of people have been displaced after their homes were destroyed, and the casualty count is expected to rise, according to Bahamian Prime Minister Hubert Minnis.\n\nThe hurricane is inching up the US east coast, where North and South Carolinians are bracing for the effects of the now-Category 3 storm.", "description": "\"It's important that we help each other out,\" the man reportedly said. \"It's better than just sitting there.
