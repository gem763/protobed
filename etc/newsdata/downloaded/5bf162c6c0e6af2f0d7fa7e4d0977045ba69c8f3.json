Lawyers for Mr Johnson said he would comply, but it would require \"extensive arrangements\" to draw up a new Queen's Speech and get ready for the ceremonial State Opening of Parliament\n\nThe judges could declare the suspension unlawful, meaning Parliament would remian in session as if it had never stopped. The government said it might still be able to consider suspending it again\n\nBut Lord Pannick said all the judges needed to do was declare the suspension unlawful. The prime minister would not have to take any action and the Speakers of the Commons and Lords could decide how to proceed.", "description": "Parliament could be reconvened immediately if Boris Johnson is ruled to have suspended it unlawfully.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07p3y1h.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
