The reopening of the park hinges on progress in North Korea\u2019s denuclearization. Kim asked Moon to make efforts to induce the participation of multinational companies in the zone as it will help open new business opportunities for South Korean companies.\u201cIf the Kaesong complex is reopened, I\u2019ll make it a factory zone where multinational companies can operate,\u201d Moon was quoted as saying by the Korea Federation of SMEs.Moon\u2019s remarks appeared to be in line with his vision of seeking inter-Korean economic cooperation through the support of the international community.During a speech at the United Nations General Assembly last month, Moon proposed turning the demilitarized zone that bisects the two Koreas into an international peace zone with the help of the UN.Friday\u2019s luncheon also brought together Park Yong-maan, chairman of the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry; Sohn Kyung-shik, head of the Korea Employers Federation; and Kim Young-ju, chief of the Korea International Trade Association.Yonhap", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
