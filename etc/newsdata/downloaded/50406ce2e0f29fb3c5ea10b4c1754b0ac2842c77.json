Now Police Say His Heroic Story Isn't True", "language": "en", "text": "Last month, still attached to hospital monitors, 50-year-old Christopher Grant told CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo how he was shot on Aug. 3 inside of a Walmart in El Paso, Texas. Now, police are saying parts of his story don\u2019t reflect what\u2019s on surveillance footage.\n\nIn the CNN interview, Grant described seeing the shooter\u2019s face, hearing people pray in Spanish for their safety, how a Customs and Border Protection officer saved his life and how he attempted to deter the shooter by throwing bottles of soda at his direction.\n\nGrant was indeed shot twice near his rib cage, according to The El Paso Times, and his sister shared on Facebook that he underwent at least two surgeries. \u201cGod Bless the families that lost their loved ones, my heart is breaking for them,\u201d she wrote.\n\nGrant was celebrated for his actions, and covered by media outlets nationwide, including a short mention by TIME.\n\nChris is a hero. When he heard gunshots, he ran toward the killer\u00e2\u20ac\u201ddistracting him even though he knew it meant he would be in the line of fire. El Paso will always be defined by people like Chris. I am so proud he calls our community home. pic.twitter.com/blJI0HArlX \u2014 Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) August 7, 2019\n\nGrant and his family were invited to The White House so that he could be recognized for his alleged act of heroism. As he and his family arrived to meet the President on Monday, the U.S. Secret Service (USSS) arrested him. While it was first reported by the Washington Examiner. Washington D.C. police confirmed to TIME that a man named Ernest Christopher Grant was detained on Monday. Mug shots of arrests in Texas under the name of Ernest Christopher Grant match images of Grant taken by CNN and shared on Facebook by Grant\u2019s family.\n\nEl Paso Police Department (EPPD) spokesperson Sgt. Enrique Carrillo tells TIME that Grant had a warrant for his arrest and was a \u201cfugitive from justice,\u201d but the warrants were not issued by the EPPD and Carrillo could not provide the agency where the warrants originated.\n\nGrant could not be reached for comment and his sister, who attended the ceremony according to her Facebook profile, did not immediately respond to TIME\u2019s request.\n\nA USSS spokesperson confirmed to TIME that a visitor to The White House was arrested on Monday, but would not release the name per protocol. \u201cIt was subsequently determined that while the arrest warrant was still active, the agency that issued the warrant would not extradite, at which time the individual was released from Secret Service custody,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement. He was not charged.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the EPPD says Grant\u2019s story about throwing bottles at the shooter doesn\u2019t align with surveillance footage of the events that day.\n\n\u201cMr. Grant\u2019s actions were captured on video, but they do not reflect his account to the media outlet [CNN],\u201d Carrillo said. \u201cIt contradicts his statements, in fact\u2026 [H]e did not take any action towards the shooter.\u201d\n\nCarrillo said surveillance footage shows Grant acting in \u201ca manner of self-preservation, as best as I can describe it, and nothing else.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not demeaning his actions,\u201d he added.\n\nCarrillo said there was no prior communication between USSS and EPPD about Grant, so Grant\u2019s arrest was not connected to the EPPD detailing what they say are his false statements to CNN. EPPD added that officials only revealed information on what was found in the surveillance footage after Grant was arrested by USSS and reporters began requesting information.\n\nAt the Monday White House ceremony honoring five heroic El Pasoans and six police officers who responded to Dayton, Ohio, mass shooting, Grant\u2019s mother stood in for her son to accept a certificate of Heroic Commendation. There, President Donald Trump praised Grant for the actions he described to CNN.\n\n\u201cChris grabbed \u2014 listen to this \u2014 soda bottles and anything else in front of him and began hurling them at the gunman distracting him from the other shoppers and causing the shooters to turn towards Chris and fire at Chris,\u201d President Trump said at the ceremony. \u201cWhereby Chris suffered two very serious gunshot wounds, but he is recovering well and we wish him the best, his family is here.\u201d", "description": "Christopher Grant was arrested at the White House attending a ceremony honoring victims and police", "authors": ["Jasmine Aguilera"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3oFlOxqbsUeEBNd3awYaSA--~B/aD02OTA7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/1059d6cafdc977c511903cfdf8b2f8aa", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
