He was a very determined guy and went all in \u2013 all the time,\u2019 Klas reflected.\n\n\u2018Yes, I think [he loved it]. Of course, after a couple of years, love of the work can also be a burden.\u2019\n\nKlas revealed that Tim, who he described as \u2018shy\u2019 growing up, first began struggling with anxiety as a teenager.\n\n\u2018When you have a child that's not feeling well, you try everything to get the situation right again. And you try to understand what's going on,\u2019 Klas said. \u2018So, we went to a psychiatrist. I think he was 14 or 15, yeah. And he sort of calmed Tim down.\u2019\n\nBut the torment of his anxiety would never truly subside. It was condition that took more and more of a grip on Avicii and he later spiraled into depression and addiction while his career continued to prosper.\n\n\u2018We talked about a lot of deep things,\u2019 Klas said. \u2018I had experience [anxiety] myself as young man. If you have experienced it yourself, you know that there are ways to get more balanced life.\u2019\n\nHeading his father\u2019s advice, Tim retired from touring in 2016 and shifted his focus towards making music in the studio.\n\nKlas said the changes in his son were remarkable. He was healthier, seemed happier, and started exercising.\n\n\u2018Things really turned into a very, very good direction,\u2019 Klas remembered.\n\nKlas revealed that Tim (pictured with mother Anki Liden in 2000), who he described as \u2018shy\u2019 growing up, first began struggling with anxiety as a teenager\n\nHeading his father\u2019s advice, Tim (right) retired from touring in 2016 and shifted his focus toward making music in the studio. Klas said the changes in his son were remarkable.

A report by TMZ would later reveal the musician\u2019s cause of death was suicide, as a result of self-inflicted injuries from a broken wine bottle.\n\nThe family released a statement shortly after his death, which read in part, 'Tim was not made for the business machine he found himself in; he was a sensitive guy who loved his fans but shunned the spotlight.'\n\nIn an interview at the time, Bergling said that he thought his son was 'happy' leading up to his death, he said never seemed too far away from being 'unhappy.\u2019\n\n'If you are very happy or extremely happy, it's not so far to be unhappy ... small things can make you sad or move your balance and I think this is what happened.'\n\nKlas revisited this idea with CBS, but said still: 'The suicide came as a shock to all of us. And we thought that he was really in a better way before.\u2019\n\nShortly before his death, Tim spoke about his anxiety, depression and addiction in a documentary, saying, \u2018Everyone knows that I've been anxious and everything, and that I've been trying.\u2019\n\nKlas lauded his son\u2019s ability to talk about his struggles, calling him \u2018brave\u2019 for doing so.\n\nIn an interview at the time, Bergling (pictured with Tim) said that he thought his son was 'happy' leading up to his death, he said never seemed too far away from being 'unhappy.\u2019 'If you are very happy or extremely happy, it's not so far to be unhappy ... small things can make you sad or move your balance and I think this is what happened.'\n\n\u2018He was so happy because he went into a career that he has dreamed of.

Of course, after a couple of years, love of the work can also be a burden\u2019\n\nBut Klas says he only recently found the strength of his own to talk about his son\u2019s suicide - or use the word suicide generally - for pronouncing it is also \u2018admitting that you\u2019re part of this destiny, so to say.\u2019\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been ups and downs,\u2019 Klas said of the last 18 months. \u2018It\u2019s a life before. And now it\u2019s a life after. That\u2019s the best way you can express it.\u2019\n\nEarlier this summer, Tim\u2019s parents posthumously released Avicii\u2019s third studio album, \u2018Tim\u2019, using unreleased music he\u2019d been working on before his death.\n\nAll the proceeds of the album sales were going to the Tim Bergling Foundation, which Klas founded, to advocate for the recognition of suicide as a global health emergency, and to remove the stigma of mental illness.\n\n\u2018[We\u2019re] trying to get the stigma away from talking about mental illness and suicide,\u2019 Klas explained. \u2018We hope we can be a voice through Tim. Because Tim has so many millions of fans.\n\n\u2018You have to talk about it,\u2019 Klas urged. \u2018And you shouldn\u2019t be afraid to ask for help.\u2019\n\nKlas said he hopes to preserve his son\u2019s legacy, and ensure he\u2019s remembered as a \u2018good person, as a good producer\u2019 and as someone who had \u2018a good heart\u2019.", "description": "Speaking with CBS' Anthony Mason, Klas Bergling paid tribute to his 'brave' son, Tim, who was found dead in his hotel room in Muscat, Oman, on April 20, 2018, aged just 28", "authors": ["Luke Kenton For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/15/19993802-0-image-a-36_1571667461305.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
