Elizabeth Warren on Thursday unveiled a plan to increase monthly Social Security benefits by $200 for every current and future beneficiary.\n\nThe plan, which the Massachusetts Democrat touted as \u201cthe biggest and most progressive increase in Social Security benefits in nearly half a century,\u201d was released hours before Warren joins nine of her 2020 rivals for the third-round Democratic primary debate.\n\nWARREN SAYS DEMOCRATS 'CAN'T CHOOSE A CANDIDATE WE DON'T BELIEVE IN BECAUSE WE'RE SCARED,' IN LIKELY JAB AT BIDEN\n\nWarren said that the \u201ctypical Social Security benefits today are quite small,\u201d noting the average beneficiary receives $1,354 a month, or $16,248 a year. Nearly 64 million Americans are Social Security beneficiaries.\n\n\u201cAnd here\u2019s the even scarier part: unless we act now, future retirees are going to be in even worse shape than the current ones,\u201d she stressed.\n\nWarren\u2019s proposal also calls for updating what she describes as \u201coutdated rules to further increase benefits for lower-income families, women, people with disabilities, public-sector workers and people of color.\u201d\n\nThe populist senator -- who has released one progressive policy proposal after another this year as she runs for the White House -- says she\u2019ll pay for extending the solvency of Social Security by nearly two decades with revenues from her plan to tax the wealthiest Americans.\n\nTHE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN\n\nWarren included an independent analysis from Moody\u2019s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi that indicated the senator\u2019s plan would \u201cimmediately lift an estimated 4.9 million seniors out of poverty, cutting the senior poverty rate by 68 percent.\u201d\n\nZandi also claimed that Warren\u2019s proposal \u2013 which calls for raising contribution requirements on the top earners and boosting average benefits by nearly 25 percent for those in the bottom half of income distribution \u2013 would produce a \u201cmuch more progressive Social Security system.\u201d\n\nAs Social Security recipients live longer, the number of beneficiaries is projected to surge to 80 million people. And a slowing population means fewer younger workers to pay into the system, raising solvency concerns.\n\nThe latest projections from the Social Security Board of Trustees indicate the reserves used to partially fund the system are expected to be depleted by 2035.", "description": "Declaring that \u201cit\u2019s getting harder to save enough for a decent retirement,\u201d Democratic presidential candidate Sen.
