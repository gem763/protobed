If he would have said that I would have thrown him out of the office,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe just wants to come back into the action like everybody else does.\u201d\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham added, \u201cI worked with John Kelly, and he was totally unequipped to handle the genius of our great President.\u201d\n\nKelly, a retired four-star Marine general, has likened his time in the White House to wrestling with a bear every day, according to a person who spoke to him. The person asked not to be identified to speak candidly. Kelly also complained about the president\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, the person said, as well as what Kelly said was Trump\u2019s obsession with news coverage of himself.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKelly and Trump were barely on speaking terms when the former chief of staff left \u2014 after 18 months of sometimes titanic clashes.\n\nIn one of their final conversations, according to a person briefed on the topic, Trump asked Kelly not to write a book \u2014 and Kelly agreed, at least until Trump was out of office.\n\nDuring the interview Saturday, Kelly expressed some regret about leaving.\n\n\u201cThat was almost 11 months ago, and I have an awful lot of, to say the least, second thoughts about leaving,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cIt pains me to see what\u2019s going on because I believe if I was still there or someone like me was there, he would not be kind of, all over the place.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMulvaney has taken the different approach of letting \u201cTrump be Trump.\u201d The acting chief of staff regularly leaves the West Wing to visit his home in South Carolina, or golf, or attend political events, according to current and former aides.\n\nAD\n\nBut Kelly had his own controversial episodes in the White House, defending the administration\u2019s family separation policy, making false statements about a U.S. congresswoman and mishandling allegations against Rob Porter, the former staff secretary.\n\nDuring a second panel discussion, Kelly called Trump\u2019s decision to pull U.S. troops out of Syria a \u201ccatastrophically bad idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t happen while I was there \u2014 and a couple of other people recently left the administration and then he went with his instinct,\u201d Kelly said.\n\nAD", "description": "Trump later released a statement denying that Kelly had ever delivered such a warning.", "authors": ["Congress", "Campaigns", "Health Policy", "Pennsylvania Politics", "Josh Dawsey", "Reporter Covering The White House"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Kr83UGwMJsLpTAUUy7ruZcxVwuE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YGRQUJVOZQI6RC2TKAIWO2HETE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
