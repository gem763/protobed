This is as good as it gets,\" Astros manager A.J. Hinch said Tuesday. \"We worked all season to get home field. We have it for a reason.\"\n\nThe Rays beat Justin Verlander in Game 4, but their reward is a matchup with Astros' co-ace Gerrit Cole (20-5, 2.50 ERA). The Cy Young candidate dominated Game 2 of the series, tossing 7 \u2154 shutout innings with 15 strikeouts for the win. It was the first time since 2000 that a pitcher has struck out 15 in a postseason game.\n\nHaving missed most of the season due to injury, Tyler Glasnow (6-1, 1.78 ERA) gets the start for the Rays. The right-hander had a solid outing in Game 1, pitching into the fifth inning and only gave up two earned runs. Glasnow isn't going to be able to go deep into the game, but if he can keep the Rays close for four or five innings, he will have done his job.\n\nGerrit Cole will start Game 5 for the Astros.

The familiarity of just seeing him,\" Rays manager Kevin Cash said.\n\nEven if Cole is great again, the Astros are going to need to score. They've only plated 13 runs in the first four games and a large part of that has been the struggles of George Springer (2-for-17) and Michael Brantley (2-for-16), who are both due to break out.\n\nAdditionally, Tampa had a \"bullpen game\" Tuesday and used six pitchers, so its relief corps could be a bit worn out. That's certainly something this experienced Houston team can exploit in the late innings.\n\nSTUNNER: Nationals shock Dodgers in Game 5\n\nJETER-ORTIZ TROPHY: MLB needs to introduce this new award\n\nWhy the Rays will win\n\nThe Astros looked listless over the two games in St. Petersburg, Floridaand all the momentum seems to belong to the Rays right now.\n\nJumping on Verlander in Game 4 showed that this team can make the necessary adjustments. Despite the pitiful showing against Cole in Game 2, the Rays will have to feel plenty confident for the rematch.\n\nAnd you can't discount the fact that the Rays have a chip on its shoulder. They were written off before the series and left for dead after dropping the first two games against the 107-win Astros.\n\n\"All year, you know, we've been getting talked down,\" Rays outfielder Tommy Pham said after Game 4. \"With the last two games, the way we played, the whole world has seen how good of a team we are and how well-rounded we are.\"\n\nWhen it comes to the bullpen, reigning Cy Young winner Blake Snell pitched in relief in Game 4, but only threw eight pitches and could be good to go for a high-leverage spot Thursday.", "description": "The Tampa Bay Rays rallied down 0-2 to force a Game 5 in the ALDS against the Houston Astros.
