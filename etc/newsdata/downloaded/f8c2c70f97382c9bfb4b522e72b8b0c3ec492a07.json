Consider the medieval riddle of its subterranean alleys or the sublime drama of its fairytale castle, and it\u2019s little wonder visitors fall under its spell. Arriving into this mind-boggling spectacle is the easy part. Figuring out where to stay is the real puzzle.\n\nI\u2019ve lived on a Georgian crescent in the West End for years \u2013 my family is from the city \u2013 and I\u2019ve explored dozens of hotels for guidebooks, magazines and newspapers. The right bed or breakfast, or the right top-shelf dram before midnight, can be a highlight of any capital stay; but with the world\u2019s biggest arts festival every summer, and festivals bookending the year, competition is fierce.\n\nSo how to avoid ending up with a dud? Edinburgh is easily navigable by foot, but it\u2019s still crucial to pick a neighbourhood that\u2019ll suit your personality, so you can map out the perfect itinerary.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nHere are my 10 favourite places that combine trend-setting style with enough tartan trim to remind you why you came to Scotland in the first place.\n\nThe Independent's hotel reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust. On some occasions, we earn revenue if you click the links and book, but we never allow this to affect our coverage.\n\nNeighbourhood: City Centre\n\nGraced with ornamental balconies, neo-renaissance turrets and a landmark clock tower that runs reliably three minutes fast (so locals don\u2019t miss their trains at nearby Waverley Station), The Balmoral is Edinburgh\u2019s most prestigious address at No 1 Princes Street.\n\nIt\u2019s the flagship property in hotelier Sir Rocco Forte\u2019s portfolio, and it shows. There\u2019s Michelin-star restaurant Number One for house-smoked salmon and a lifetime\u2019s worth of single malts; new restaurant Brasserie Prince from French chef extraordinaire Alain Roux; and a tartan butler (should you desperately need a bespoke plaid kilt hand-delivered to your room). Room decor runs the gamut from Hebridean armchairs and woodland wallpapers to Sean Connery James Bond prints and brass owl door knockers. Those mighty fine birds can be seen when splashing out on the JK Rowling Suite, where the Edinburgh resident wrote the last instalment of her wizarding saga.\n\nOf the individually designed 188 rooms, pick a west-facing suite with heart-in-mouth views of Edinburgh Castle and the steampunk gothic aesthetic of the Scott Monument. A prospect good enough for The Rolling Stones, Paul McCartney and Elizabeth Taylor no less.\n\nDoubles from \u00a3220, room only\n\ngrandluxuryhotels.com\n\nBest for a Highland fling: Prestonfield House\n\nNeighbourhood: Prestonfield\n\nStride past the herd of Highland cows and strutting peacocks, past deer estate turned golf course, then greet the kilted doormen waiting on you hand and foot. This 23-room country hotel is set within the city limits, but a world apart in terms of architecture, art, antiques and ambience.\n\nLocated in eight hectares of parkland, with a croquet lawn and putting green, this grand baroque manor is more Highland hunting lodge than urban bolthole. Check out the Bonnie Prince Charlie-meets-Alexander McQueen design and riot of stag antler armchairs and gilded mirrors for proof. Then, in the middle distance, beyond the golf course, eye the gorse-trimmed ridge line of dormant volcano Arthur\u2019s Seat, offering a Highland reverie in miniature. That shiver down your spine? This is Scotland, in all its brash, intoxicating glory.\n\nDoubles from \u00a3345, including full breakfast\n\nprestonfield.com\n\nNeighbourhood: West End\n\nNot many hotels can claim one of the most talked-about restaurants in the city, but this is the main attraction at Baba, a Levant-inspired charcoal grill and cocktail bar that dominates the ground floor at this sprawling collection of townhouses. It\u2019s a seductive spot from Glasgow-based Ox and Finch, with Phileas Fogg travel souvenirs, ruby-red Persian wall rugs and medina-style glass lamps.\n\nThe hotel itself is geared towards a young, city-breaking crowd, wedged between the bar-hopping pubs of Rose Street and splashier clubs of George Street, making this ground zero for those with unruly beards, sailor tattoos and progressive hairstyles. That also explains the record players, candy-red bedside telephones and punked-up animal prints in the rooms. Which are just as cool as they sound. For rainy days, there\u2019s a pool, sauna and steam room.\n\nDoubles from \u00a3107, room only\n\nphcompany.com/principal/edinburgh-charlotte-square\n\nNeighbourhood: Royal Mile\n\nAll the drama of gothic Scotland is on display at this frozen-in-time restaurant with rooms, secreted in the shadow of Edinburgh Castle. It\u2019s a nine-room thriller, with lavish decor pitched between a Hammer Horror film set and Dracula\u2019s boudoir, the attention to detail coming from owner James Thomson (the brains behind similarly-dramatic Prestonfield House). I particularly love the Carry On camp glamour of The Inner Sanctum, where my brother and sister-in-law hosted knock-out post-reception drinks on their wedding night.\n\nExpect opulent eccentricity and second-to-none hospitality at the hotel\u2019s signature Secret Garden restaurant, too \u2013 it\u2019s hidden down a historic close and entered via a pulpit reception.\n\nDoubles from \u00a3345, including full breakfast\n\nthewitchery.com\n\nNeighbourhood: City Centre\n\nThis historic railway grand dame was first built in 1903 before being swallowed by the Hilton empire, but don\u2019t let that put you off. Nostalgia and whimsy are ever-present in the railway-themed Caley Bar, while the tartan-tailored bellhops and sensational views of Edinburgh Castle more than make up for the off-the-shelf decor.\n\nThere are plenty of diversions to be had: the UK\u2019s only Guerlain spa, the culinary highs of headline restaurant The Pompadour by Galvin and an ABC of chain stores are moments away on Princes Street and George Street. In a country blessed with distilleries, Edinburgh still manages to surprise: Edinburgh Gin Distillery, across the street on Rutland Place, offers highly recommended tastings and tours.\n\nDoubles from \u00a3215, room only\n\nwaldorfastoria3.hilton.com\n\nNeighbourhood: Stockbridge\n\nEdinburgh is a go-to spot for outdoor purists, with almost half its area made up of parkland, gardens and little-known wilderness. For my money, the best of this can be found in the smart neighbourhood of Stockbridge, home to the Royal Botanic Garden and Inverleith Park, but also the Water of Leith, a trapped-in-time river off the main tourist trail.\n\nIn striking distance of the riverside is upcycled Georgian mansion The Raeburn, built in the 1830s and complete with kid-friendly bar, brasserie restaurant, cosy library and sociable garden. Upstairs, the 10 bedrooms are outfitted with plenty of high-frills \u2013 rainforest showers, monster TVs, espresso machines \u2013 while the window views highlight a great selection of independent coffee shops and bric-a-brac stores to explore at your leisure. A final perk of staying is Michelin-star chef Tom Kitchin\u2019s family-friendly kitchen, The Scran and Scallie, directly across the road.\n\nDoubles from \u00a3150, including full breakfast\n\ntheraeburn.com\n\nNeighbourhood: City Centre\n\nSt Andrews Square has seen a complete rehabilitation of late, with a whole roster of new tenants parachuting in from London. First came wildly-popular restaurants The Ivy, Wahaca and Dishoom, now the square welcomes this luxury set of apartments in the former HQ of the Royal Bank of Scotland. Every detail swoons, with no expense spared from the chessboard marble floor and dark wood panelling in the lobby, through to the 50 grand apartments with roll-top baths, mod con kitchens and caber-high ceilings.\n\nClearly, there\u2019s plenty of ambition on display. Part of the development in the former banking hall is the first Scottish outpost of Hawksmoor, the most arresting steak restaurant in London for the past decade.\n\nApartments from \u00a3225\n\nlateralcity.com\n\nNeighbourhood: Leith\n\nWith a striking castle-fa\u00e7ade and a gorgeous Georgian waterfront location, Malmaison is set within this former Seaman\u2019s Mission in dockside Leith. It\u2019s an on-fire foodie fave, with nearby pedigree provided by Edinburgh\u2019s two most fabulous restaurants \u2013 Michelin-star darlings The Kitchin and Martin Wishart are a brisk walk away. For crustacean lovers, there are also bumper-to-bumper restaurants where you can pick over the day\u2019s catch. My firm favourite is Fisher\u2019s.\n\nInside, bedrooms are bright and breezy, with harbour views, curlicue beds and mottled grey headboards. The standout design feature is the Port of Leith Suite, with tartan-red bathtub big enough to swim in. Downstairs, the foodie theme continues at brickwork-heavy brasserie Chez Mal, once where salty dogs and sozzled sailors downed dirty drams after dropping anchor.\n\nRooms from \u00a3113, room only\n\nmalmaison.com/locations/edinburgh\n\nNeighbourhood: Stockbridge\n\nBlink and you\u2019ll miss it. In a whisper-quiet location in the New Town, this 28-room hotel makes the perfect base for those who are confident enough to venture out without a map. The petite doubles are just that \u2013 compact, without feeling pokey \u2013 but there are a handful of bumper suites with whirlpool baths and sash window views onto a private garden. The colour palette is a haze of grey and gold, and beside the modish armchairs and shag rugs the pocket-sprung bed and goose down pillows are a delight. There\u2019s also a sustainably-sourced restaurant with a menu built-up from Perthshire beef, Berwickshire lamb, Clackmannanshire game and Loch Duart salmon. The best bit? In this location, it\u2019s all too easy to blend in as a local.\n\nRooms from \u00a355 B&B\n\nniracaledonia.com\n\nNeighbourhood: Royal Mile\n\nFirst a council office, then the fashionably-glam Missoni hotel, then the G&V Royal Mile Hotel, this sandstone building has finally found its perfect tenant thanks to the arrival of the Radisson brand. The location can\u2019t be beat, affording enviable views of central Edinburgh\u2019s commercial hodgepodge, raising you to the level of the castle atop the Royal Mile, while also within spitting distance of Edinburgh\u2019s chief must-dos. Start at Greyfriars Kirkyard, then box-tick the National Museum of Scotland and St Giles\u2019 Cathedral. Follow tradition outside the high kirk and spit on the Heart of Midlothian mosaic in the cobbles. You\u2019ll be blessed with good fortune, or so us locals say.\n\nRooms have had a makeover since the takeover, with stenciled wallpapers, splashes of heather, lavender and light grey, and one-off artworks from the likes of Scots\u2019 textile mavericks Timorous Beasties. Mallow enthusiasts will also love the giant prints of Scotland\u2019s retro sweet treat, the Tunnock\u2019s teacake. Better than all that? Chef Andy McQueen's Cucina restaurant is one of the finest Italians in the Lothians.\n\nRooms from \u00a3189, room only\n\nradissoncollection.com", "description": "Long-time Edinburgh resident Mike MacEacheran has rounded up his favourite hotels foor luxury, top design, romance and family holidays", "authors": ["Mike Maceacheran"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/21/10/the-edinburgh-grand-lobby-reception.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-04"}
