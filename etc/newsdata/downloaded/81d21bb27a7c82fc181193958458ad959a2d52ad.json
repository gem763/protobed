Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet's best red carpet moments 1/20 Venice Film Festival, September 2019 The actor stepped out in a slick silver suit complete with a cinched-in waist and a matching silk shirt. The cropped trousers gave way to Chalamet's glistening black boots. AFP/Getty Images 2/20 Venice Film Festival, September 2019 For a photocall earlier on that day, Chalamet chose a more casual silver ensemble consisting of cropped trousers, a boxy sports luxe blazer and a turquoise shirt. Getty Images 3/20 British Academy Film Awards, February 2019 It was patterns galore for Chalamet at the BAFTAs, who turned up in a look designed entirely by Haider Ackerman. The \"Beautiful Boy\" actor matched his leopard metallic blazer to his shirt while his black trousers with checkered side detail added an extra dose of eccentricity. WireImage 4/20 Golden Globe Awards, January 2019 Ah, the famous harness. Chalamet's sparkly straps confused fans at first, but, like with many avant-garde garments, it wasn't long before the style set came calling and cried \"FASHUN!\". It's only a matter of weeks before you stumble across a harness at a Topman near you. AFP/Getty Images 5/20 Annual Critics' Choice Awards, January 2019 This galactic look by Alexander McQueen is enough to transport you straight to Pluto. Colourful brushstrokes enchant while sharp tailoring brings it all together in one punchy fashion statement. Getty Images 6/20 30th Annual Palm Springs International Film Festival Film Awards Gala, January 2019 The double-breasted suit is good, the grey shade makes it better, but the boots are the undisputed highlight of this outfit, adding a pleasingly vintage aesthetic with their burnished texture. Take note, aspiring double-breasted suit-wearers. Getty Images for Palm Springs In 7/20 BFI London Film Festival, October 2018 Few could pull off such an outlandish Alexander McQueen suit, but Chalamet wears those oversized florals with unrivaled swagger. Tim P. Whitby/Getty Images for B 8/20 \"Beautiful Boy\" LA premiere, October 2018 The young actor was a man in red at the LA premiere of his latest film, where he wore a scarlet suit designed by Louis Vuitton. Getty Images 9/20 Toronto International Film Festival, September 2018 A splattering of white makes this suit look like an artistic experiment. This Haider Ackermann option proves that a black tux need not be dull. The slim-fit makes for a sophisticated silhouette while the white appliqu\u00e9 pays homage to Chalamet's rebellious sartorial spirit. Getty Images 10/20 San Sebastian International Film Festival, September 2018 If you're going to wear a floral suit, you should pair it with box-fresh white sneakers. At least, that's the main takeaway from Chalamet's blooming ensemble here. It's another Alexander McQueen creation, in case you were wondering. Getty Images 11/20 Vanity Fair Oscar Party, March 2018 Chalamet went all-white for his first Academy Awards, an outfit that he maintained for the infamous Vanity Fair after party, where he is pictured here. The suit, designed by Berluti, made the first-time nominee look both youthful and dapper. Getty Images 12/20 Annual Academy Awards Nominee Luncheon, February 2018 Thanks to the jet black hue of his hair, olive green is a shade that suits the 23-year-old actor, as this look aptly demonstrates. AFP/Getty Images 13/20 London Film Critics Circle Awards, January 2018 The satin sheen of this suit adds an upscale twist, taking the deep blue two-piece to the next sartorial frontier. Stiff black biker boots add a rebellious edge. Getty Images 14/20 Film Independent Spirit Awards, January 2018 Suede jackets seem to be a bit of a motif for the young actor. Though this one is in a more traditional shade than some of his other, more eccentric, options. Getty Images 15/20 GQ Men of the Year party, December 2017 Checked tuxedos are a smart casual fail safe, as Chalamet demonstrates with aplomb here. All you need is a simple collared shirt and a slicked-back hairdo to complete the look. Getty Images for GQ 16/20 BFI London Film Festival, October 2017 A burgundy jacket is always a good idea, especially when paired with a white collared shirt and trousers that come in an equally earthy shade of brown. 17/20 Toronto International Film Festival, September 2017 Double-breasted jackets have had a renaissance in recent years in both men and women's fashion. Here, Chalamet shows why the look works so well on men, particularly when the aesthetic is so Peaky Blinders-esque. Getty Images for Entertainment W 18/20 Toronto International Film Festival, September 2017 Roll necks might be synonymous with Andy Warhol and the Sixties, but as nostalgia continues to permeate the runways, they're making a comeback among other vintage staples. Chalamet pulls the style off by opting for an olive green shade, which stands out underneath the black tuxedo. Getty Images 19/20 Toronto International Film Festival, September 2017 Electric blue is a go-to for many red carpet aficionados, but it's a shade that's rarely seen on men, making Chalamet's choice particularly noticeable and commendable. Getty Images 20/20 Berlinale International Film Festival, February 2017 Purple suede jackets are a rare sight. Clearly, Chalamet, who is rumoured not to have a stylist, is quite the savvy shopper. A statement piece like this deserves to shine, and it does here, with nothing but black trousers and a black sweatshirt to distract from the excellence of that jacket.
