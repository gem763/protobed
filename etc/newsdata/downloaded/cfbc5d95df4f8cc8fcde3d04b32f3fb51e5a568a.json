We may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page.\n\nWalmart's big sale on Sceptre TVs is no joke with models starting at just $85. (Photo: Walmart/Yahoo Lifestyle) More\n\nYou don\u2019t have to spend big bucks to get a TV with crystal-clear clarity: you just need a Sceptre! Walmart is offering plenty of deep discounts on HD and 4K TVs from the brand, a wallet-friendly (yet high-quality) TV manufacturer based in City of Industry, California.\n\nIn fact, Sceptre \u2014 which was established in 1984 \u2014 doesn\u2019t include flashy features like out-of-the-box video streaming and smart home settings like other brands like TCL and Hisense. Instead, the company specializes in researching and developing premium displays and immaculate picture quality at affordable prices.\n\nThe prices dip as low as $85 with a Sceptre 32-inch Class HD LED TV (X322BV-SR), which is $95 off its list price. However, the biggest standout is the top-rated Sceptre 65-inch Class 4K Ultra HD HDR LED TV (U650CV-U). Originally priced at $900, it\u2019s now more than half off its original price and just $410. That\u2019s $490 in savings!\n\nThis 4K TV features a massive 65-inch LED display with brilliant color accuracy and a crystal clear picture quality at an Ultra HD resolution. The size and clarity are its two biggest selling points, along with its four high-speed HDMI ports for Blu-ray players, video game consoles and streaming devices like an Apple TV or Chromecast. In addition, you can use also the money you saved on Sceptre TVs and pick up an inexpensive Roku device for video streaming Netflix, HBO Now, YouTube, Hulu and more.\n\nThe Sceptre TV also features a MHL (Mobile High-Definition Link) port, which is something you rarely see included on a 4K TV. This port makes it possible to connect smartphones and tablets directly to the TV for additional functionality and streaming options, so you don\u2019t have to deal with connecting wirelessly via WiFi or Bluetooth.\n\nAt only $410, this Sceptre 4K TV is a steal \u2014 we\u2019re sure it won\u2019t stay in stock for long!\n\nThis 4K TV has a 4.2 out of five-star review rating. (Photo: Walmart) More\n\n\u201cOf course I was highly skeptical purchasing a brand I'd never heard of, but I did my research and read many many reviews and decided to take the lea,\u201d another satisfied Walmart reviewer wrote. \u201cI was looking for a 65-inch without spending a mortgage payment! From packaging to picture quality, these folks are spot on! I've now had the TV for 3 days and I can't be more pleased. Also, note that this is a USA MADE TV, which is a plus in my book!\u201d\n\n\u201cSome people may be put off by the fact that it's not a \u2018smart set\u2019 or think that an inexpensive set should have incredible audio, but that's not me,\u201d another reviewer raved. \u201cI already have a sound system with 5.1 surround speakers and use an Amazon Fire TV box for a brain (which allows me to stream 4K). I basically got this set to use as a monitor and the picture is excellent and that was all I cared about. My father-in-law compares the picture quality to his $3,000.00 60-inch Pioneer plasma set (which bugs him, but pleases me).\u201d\n\nWant something smaller?
