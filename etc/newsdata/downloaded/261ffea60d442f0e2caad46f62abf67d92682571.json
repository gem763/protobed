The president has called on Republicans to be more vocal in backing his efforts at dismissing the inquiry, and respond they did.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

One aim is to stop witnesses discussing testimony with each other. There are also Republicans who sit on the investigating committees in the hearing room: it is not like the party is being shut out.\n\nBut the disruption caused by Republicans proves there is still something to be wary of for Democrats. Something that Trump, and the Republicans around him, has sought to do constantly \u2013 muddy the waters around any scandal he finds himself involved in.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It would mean cable news coverage that could dog Trump for weeks or months, with a narrative that is fairly simple to follow. But that is also its biggest potential weakness \u2013 the events surrounding the Trump phone call with Zelensky is now clear in the minds of the public, leaving little new news. The only significant twist on the horizon is whether Trump\u2019s former national security adviser John Bolton testifies.\n\nBut the bigger issue is that public hearings will also open the door to questions from Republicans who sit on the investigating committees. The aim for them will be to fill possible airtime on television with questions about Joe Biden, his son Hunter Biden and Hunter\u2019s role on the board of directors of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company.\n\nThe tactic will be about distracting the public from the main narrative the Democrats want them to follow. The more time is filled with questions about the Bidens \u2013 however little merit there are in them \u2013 means diluting the Democrats\u2019 message.\n\nThere are reports that Democrats may limit the number of public hearings and who testifies in them, but Democrats can only really trust the testimony they have.\n\nThey will hope it is enough.", "description": "The battle over the merits of public versus private hearings in the Democrat-led impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump reached a flashpoint this week with Republicans barging into a high-security hearing room and ordering pizza, forcing a five-hour delay in testimony from a Pentagon official.", "authors": ["Chris Stevenson"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/26/12/trump.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
