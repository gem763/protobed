Here\u2019s what we found.\n\nSomething is odd about Brett Kavanaugh\u2014student first at an elite prep school, then Yale College, then Yale Law School, as he emphasized again and again during his confirmation hearing\u2014playing the role of an everyman. But he can still be the essential American boy. Less at home in the fairy tale of elite American colleges, according to Pogrebin and Kelly, was Deborah Ramirez, who came to Yale as a smart student making do with loans and work-study jobs and who struggled to fit in with her wealthier classmates. Ramirez, the reporters write, was \u201cunsettled\u201d by her freshman-year interaction with Kavanaugh: According to her, he pulled down his pants in front of her at a party, leading her to accidentally touch him. Some partygoers laughed. The incident, Ramirez told Pogrebin and Kelly, \u201cripped away\u201d her self-image as well behaved and studious; she described the joke played on her as a way to \u201cmake it clear I\u2019m not smart.\u201d\n\nMany conservative commentators have focused on another allegation of similar behavior by the college-aged Kavanaugh contained in the book, noting that the second woman to whom he allegedly exposed himself has told friends she does not remember the incident. What struck me, though, was not the alleged second interaction, but Ramirez\u2019s story, and in particular her account of the glee of her classmates. \u201cIndelible in the hippocampus is the laughter,\u201d Christine Blasey Ford said at the Senate hearing, when asked what she remembered of her own alleged encounter, in which she said Kavanaugh climbed on top of her while his friend watched. \u201cThe uproarious laughter between the two, and their having fun at my expense.\u201d\n\nThere are many people who are bullies when young and remain bullies. The irony is that\u2014even if the allegations about his behavior as a young man are true\u2014Kavanaugh was not, by all accounts, a bully as an adult. The opposite, in fact. He was known as a mentor to young women trying to find their footing in elite circles adjacent to those from which Deborah Ramirez felt shut out\u2014particularly young conservative women, for whom mentors in the legal field can be hard to find. Pogrebin and Kelly cited \u201cdozens of former clerks, many of them women\u201d who told them about Kavanaugh\u2019s \u201cmentorship, his warmth, his eagerness to help advance their professional prospects, and his willingness to support their personal lives, including raising families.\u201d Ultimately, the reporters wrote, they \u201ccame to believe an utterly human narrative: that Ford and Ramirez were mistreated by Kavanaugh when he was a teenager, and that Kavanaugh over the next 35 years became a better person.\u201d\n\nSimilar character references provoked mockery from Kavanaugh\u2019s opponents throughout the confirmation process, even before Ford\u2019s allegations became public. (\u201cShut the Hell Up About Brett Kavanaugh Being a Nice Guy,\u201d read a representative objection.) So, too, were stories about Kavanaugh\u2019s warmth and openness as a mentor. Yet those testimonials matter, not because they are exonerating\u2014they aren\u2019t\u2014but because they give context to the very particular pain of learning that a person widely known to be decent is alleged to have done an unforgivable thing.", "description": "The power of the stories is how normal they are.", "authors": ["Quinta Jurecic", "Contributing Writer At"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/GettyImages_997141860/facebook.jpg?1568819232", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
