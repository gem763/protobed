Even small changes in the criteria could have far-reaching effects: When the DNC set its thresholds at 65,000 donors or 1 percent in polls earlier this year, 20 candidates made the stage.\n\nBut merely increasing the polling threshold to 2 percent in four DNC-approved surveys, and doubling the donor threshold, capped the September debate at one night. Even a modest increase for November could spell the end of several campaigns that are just hanging on to the debate stage, and while we know the criteria are likely to keep going up, no one knows exactly how it will affect the 2020 field. And in a nationalized presidential election, the debates have proven to be the most important opportunity for candidates to introduce themselves to large audiences and try to change the direction of their campaigns.\n\n\u201cMy only complaint with the DNC\u2019s process is that they haven\u2019t announced what the heck is going on for the November debates yet,\u201d Democratic candidate Andrew Yang told POLITICO, asking whether any reporters knew what the new thresholds would be.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com Story"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
