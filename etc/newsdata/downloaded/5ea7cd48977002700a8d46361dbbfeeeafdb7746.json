But a great deal of residents seem to have found it in these 10 places, according to the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index.\n\nDigital health company Sharecare, working with Gallup, has conducted more than 2.6 million surveys nationwide since 2008 to gauge \"Americans' perceptions of their lives and their daily experiences.\" The Well-Being Index is based specifically on residents' feelings about five elements of well-being: \"purpose\" (liking what you do and being motivated to achieve goals), \"social\" (having supportive relationships and love), \"financial\" (managing your budget to feel secure), \"community\" (liking where you live) and \"physical\" (being in good health). The higher the score, on a scale of 0 to 100, the happier residents indicate they are about where and how they are living their lives.\n\nTo come up with our original list of the 50 best places to retire in the U.S.--one in each state--we factored in the \"community\" and \"physical\" components of the Well-Being Index, where available, as well as living costs, safety, median incomes and poverty rates for retirement-age residents and the availability of recreational and health care facilities. The following 10 retirement destinations rank the highest in terms of the overall well-being of residents. See if you agree, and consider whether any might make a happy place for your own retirement.\n\nGetty Images\n\nWell-being score: 63.0 (U.S.: 61.8)\n\nCity population: 42,453\n\nShare of population 65+: 10.7%\n\nCost of living for retirees: 16.4% above the national average\n\nAverage income for population 65+: n/a\n\nState's tax rating for retirees: Least Tax Friendly\n\nThis small mountain city on the shores of Lake Champlain is a picturesque setting for tree-hugging retirees. Outdoor recreation is plentiful with miles of hiking and biking paths, nearby beaches where you can swim, kayak or paddleboard in the warmer months, and numerous skiing options in the area. An eco-friendly vibe permeates the town, from the businesses bolstering the city's economy, such as household-products maker Seventh Generation, to the local food movement feeding the neighborhood.\n\nBut being green isn't easy on your wallet. Taxes and living costs are high. While the median home value is a low $206,000 in the Green Mountain State, compared with the median $229,000 for the U.S., it climbs to $326,500 in Burlington. A private room in a metro area nursing home costs a median $11,498 a month, compared with $8,365 a month for the U.S. At least you can save money on academic pursuits. The University of Vermont will cover tuition costs for state residents age 65 and older who wish to take a class, even if it's for credit.\n\nGetty Images\n\n\n\n\n\nWell-being score: 63.1\n\nCity population: 120,903\n\nShare of population 65+: 12.0%\n\nCost of living for retirees: 2.1% above the national average\n\nAverage income for population 65+: $45,574\n\nState's tax rating for retirees: Tax Friendly\n\nSouthern charm, a rich history, city living and nearby beaches combine to make Charleston a uniquely attractive retirement destination. History buffs, in particular, can appreciate the city's Civil War sites, including Fort Sumter, and well-preserved antebellum architecture. The Preservation Society of Charleston is the oldest community-based historic preservation group in the country.\n\nFoodies, too, can find plenty to enjoy along Charleston's cobblestone streets, especially in the brunch and comfort food areas. And if you need to work off some of those calories, water sports, including surfing, paddle boarding and kayaking, are popular local activities--along with boating and fishing.\n\nSee Also: 16 Small Towns Where You Can Retire Early\n\n8. Provo, Utah\n\nGetty Images\n\n\n\n\n\nWell-being score: 63.2\n\nCity population: 116,199\n\nShare of population 65+: 6.0%\n\nCost of living for retirees: 1.7% below the national average\n\nAverage income for population 65+: n/a\n\nState's tax rating for retirees: Least Tax Friendly\n\nThe Beehive State, 10th in our 2018 rankings of the best states for retirement, is a sweet spot for active retirees. And Provo, with mountain peaks within the city limits and Utah Lake on its doorstep, is particularly buzz-worthy. Brigham Young University offers intellectual stimulation to complement the physical activity. Plus, living costs are low while incomes are high, at an average $97,958 a year for residents age 60 and up.\n\nAnother feather in its cap: The Milken Institute rates Provo as the best large city for successful aging, noting the area's vibrant economy and safety, as well as the population's healthy lifestyles and high levels of volunteering among older adults. The metro area also has an abundance of health care facilities, about 32 establishments per 1,000 seniors compared with about 19 per 1,000 seniors in the U.S.\n\n7. Richland, Wash.\n\nGetty Images\n\n\n\n\n\nWell-being score: 63.6\n\nCity population: 53,991\n\nShare of population 65+: 15.5%\n\nCost of living for retirees: 1.7% below the national average\n\nAverage income for population 65+: $70,059\n\nState's tax rating for retirees: Tax Friendly\n\nRichland's metro area includes Kennewick, both of which qualify as great retirement destinations. But the smaller of the two, Richland, has an older population with a higher average income (Kennewick's is $57,989) and lower poverty rate (7.6% compared with 8.3% in Kennwick--both lower than the national poverty rate of 9.3% for people age 65 and older).\n\nWhether you're partial to exploring the great outdoors or focusing on wine country, you have plenty of options--you don't even have to choose one over the other. You can enjoy boating and fishing on the Columbia, Yakima and Snake Rivers, and hiking or biking on the 23-mile Sacagawea Trail. There are also more than 200 wineries within a 50-mile radius, offering beautiful views and many wines to sample.\n\n6. Cape Coral, Fla.\n\nGetty Images\n\n\n\n\n\nWell-being score: 63.6\n\nCity population: 173,679\n\nShare of population 65+: 21.9%\n\nCost of living for retirees: 2.4% below the national average\n\nAverage income for population 65+: $42,123\n\nState's tax rating for retirees: Most Tax Friendly\n\nWith its desirable climate and favorable tax status, Florida is filled with popular retirement destinations. Many of our favorite retirement spots in the Sunshine State can be found along the Gulf Coast including St. Petersburg, Sarasota and Punta Gorda.\n\nCape Coral's metro area includes Fort Myers, yet another great place to consider for your retirement. But Cape Coral is unique in its waterway access, offering more than 400 miles of canals for all your boating, fishing and water sports dreams. And land lovers can enjoy the area's beaches, golfing, tennis, parks and other recreational offerings.\n\n5. Durham-Chapel Hill, N.C.\n\nGetty Images\n\n\n\n\n\nWell-being score: 63.6\n\nMetro population: 550,281 (Durham: 257,170)\n\nShare of population 65+: 13.6% (Durham: 10.8%)\n\nCost of living for retirees: 10.5% below the national average\n\nAverage income for population 65+: $63,046 (Durham:$59,567)\n\nState's tax rating for retirees: Not Tax Friendly\n\nDuke University and the University of North Carolina may be bitter sports rivals, but their hometowns of Durham and Chapel Hill, respectively, team up to form a powerhouse metro area, and a great place to retire. Indeed, the Milken Institute ranks Durham-Chapel Hill as the third best large metro area for successful aging--crediting the area's economic strength, as two-thirds of North Carolina's Research Triangle (the other third being Raleigh), and quality health care. The universities play a big role in those two advantages and also boost up the local cultural and recreational scenes, like in many college towns.\n\nThough not a deal-breaker for every retiree, it's worth noting that violent crimes are more prevalent in Durham than they are for the nation as a whole. The rate of violent crime is 8.6 per 1,000 residents, according to the Neighborhood Scout, compared with a national median of 4 violent crimes per 1,000 residents. Chapel Hill rates safer, with just 1.8 violent crimes per 1,000 residents. And the real estate values reflect it: The median home value is $382,900 in Chapel Hill and $229,900 in Durham, according to Zillow.\n\nSee Also: 31 Kirkland Signature Products Retirees Should Buy at Costco\n\n4. Carlsbad, Calif.\n\nGetty Images\n\n\n\n\n\nWell-being score: 63.8*\n\nCity population: 113,147\n\nShare of population 65+: 16.0%\n\nCost of living for retirees: 40.6% above the national average\n\nAverage income for population 65+: $70,348\n\nState's tax rating for retirees: Mixed\n\nPart of the San Diego metro area, Carlsbad offers a small-city feel with easy access to big-city amenities. It has a vibrant cultural community, ocean-side living and sunny climate. You can also find 40 parks, more than 50 miles of hiking trails and a full calendar of artsy offerings, including Foreign Film Fridays in the spring and free concerts in the summer. (Not that there are really seasons in Carlsbad: Throughout the year, average highs fall between 62 and 71 degrees Fahrenheit, and average lows only go down to between 45 and 64 degrees Fahrenheit, according to Weather.com. And rainy days are rare.) Plus, you can choose among a host of retirement communities with ocean views.\n\nOf course, you have to be able to afford it. Like much of California--where living costs are 69% above the national average, making it the second-most expensive state in the country behind only Hawaii--Carlsbad and the whole metro area is a pricey place to live. For example, the median home value in the U.S. is $229,000, according to Zillow; in California, it's $548,600; and in Carlsbad, it's (brace yourself) $860,700, which is still better than San Diego's stunning $1.4 million median. And taxes throughout Cali also weigh heavily on your wallet.\n\n*Data for San Diego-Carlsbad metropolitan statistical area.\n\nSEE ALSO: 25 Small Towns Where Millionaires Live\n\n3. Portland, Maine\n\nGetty Images\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell-being score: 63.9\n\nCity population: 66,715\n\nShare of population 65+: 13.7%\n\nCost of living for retirees: 17.1% above the national average\n\nAverage income for population 65+: $44,769\n\nState's tax rating for retirees: Mixed\n\nThe largest city in Maine, Portland offers a lively downtown and plenty of urban-esque amenities amidst the great outdoors of the Pine Tree State. You can enjoy museums, theaters and an array of eclectic dining. The flagship L.L. Bean store in nearby Freeport is a must-see for many visitors, but resident shoppers also flock to Portland's unique boutiques and outlets.\n\nAll the while, you're never too far from the area's many beaches. That means ample opportunity to lounge on the shore or dive into water-based activities including fishing, kayaking, sailing and even surfing. And of course, hiking and biking trails abound--perfect in the (much) colder months, too, for cross-country skiing and snowshoeing.\n\n2. Ann Arbor, Mich.\n\nGetty Images\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell-being score: 64.4\n\nCity population: 119,303\n\nShare of population 65+: 11.3%\n\nCost of living for retirees: n/a\n\nAverage income for population 65+: $82,971\n\nState's tax rating for retirees: Not Tax Friendly\n\nAnother college town well suited to retirees, Ann Arbor is home to the University of Michigan with all its educational programs (including the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute), sporting events and cultural affairs. The university also runs the Geriatrics Center & Institute of Gerontology, which focuses on health care issues that come with aging. Along with its research facilities, medical facilities and staff, the Center offers programs and classes to help older adults maximize their good health and independence.\n\nIn fact, Ann Arbor's health care facilities are top-notch, helping to earn it a sixth-place ranking among small metro areas for successful aging, according to the Milken Institute. The area's public transportation options are another noted winning attribute for older residents. A downside, however, is affordability. Overall living costs are 27.1% above the national average, according to Sperling's BestPlaces, and the median home value is $378,600, versus just $153,000 for the rest of the state, according to Zillow.\n\n1. Charlottesville, Va.\n\nGetty Images\n\n\n\n\n\nWell-being score: 65.0\n\nCity population: 46,487\n\nShare of population 65+: 10.4%\n\nCost of living for retirees: 0.2% below the national average\n\nAverage income for population 65+: n/a\n\nState's tax rating for retirees: Tax Friendly\n\nRenaissance man Thomas Jefferson laid the foundation for the well-rounded city his hometown has become. From his University of Virginia's hollering Hoos to the artists on the downtown promenade, the Charlottesville community is an unexpected blend of Southern charm and liberal edge, a nice choice for a range of retiree personalities. And beyond the college campus and city center, you can find plenty of options for outdoor recreation in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, including more than 100 miles of of the Appalachian Trail in nearby Shenandoah National Park.\n\nIn August 2017, Charlottesville captured national attention when a gathering of white nationalists to protest the removal of a monument to Robert E. Lee turned into a violent rally, injuring dozens of counter-protesters and killing one, Heather Heyer. In general though, the city's violent crime rate is a low 175.4 reported incidents per 100,000 residents, compared with a 297.8 rate for all U.S. cities of similar size, according to the FBI. Charlottesville also ranks fifth for overall well-being, out of all 187 metro areas included in the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index, with above-average scores in all categories, including physical health and resident satisfaction.\n\nHow We Picked the 50 Best Places to Retire\n\nGetty Images\n\n\n\n\n\nTo pinpoint one great retirement destination in each state, we weighed a number of factors:\n\nCost of living for retirees for major metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas, with data provided by the Council for Community and Economic Research, includes overall costs, housing, food and groceries, transportation, utilities, health care and miscellaneous expenses.\n\nHousehold incomes, poverty rates and number of health care facilities are from the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nCommunity well-being and physical well-being scores are provided by digital health company Sharecare, in collaboration with Gallup. These are two of the five elements of well-being that make up the overall Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index. (The other three elements are purpose, social and financial well-being.) The index is calculated on a scale of 0 to 100 and based on more than 2.5 million nationally representative surveys. Community well-being is defined as \"liking where you live, feeling safe and having pride in your community.\" Physical well-being is \"having good health and enough energy to get things done daily.\" We display the community score for each place we chose.\n\nPopulation data, including the percentage of the population that is age 65 and older, is also provided by the Census Bureau. The figures are highlighted in these rankings for the benefit of readers, but were not factors in our methodology for ranking the best places to retire.\n\nTaxes on retirees, based on Kiplinger's Retiree Tax Map, which divides states into five categories: Most Tax Friendly, Tax Friendly, Mixed, Not Tax Friendly and Least Tax Friendly. This information is provided for the benefit of readers but was not factored into our selections within each state.\n\nEDITOR'S PICKS\n\n\n\nCopyright 2019 The Kiplinger Washington Editors", "description": "A state of happiness cannot be pinpointed on a map.
