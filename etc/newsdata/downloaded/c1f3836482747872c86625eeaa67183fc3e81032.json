Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for a high-profile climate award, although it\u2019s unlikely to earn a place on his mantel.\n\nMr. Gore was announced Friday as the winner of the top Climate Hypocrite Award, a tongue-in-cheek \u201chonor\u201d presented by Sen. Jim Inhofe, Oklahoma Republican, aimed at recognizing what he described as climate-change leaders who fail to walk the talk.\n\n\u201cClimate alarmists are eager to tell Americans that they need to take radical action, including going vegan, ending air travel, not having children and eliminating fossil fuels and nuclear energy, but they aren\u2019t willing to back up their data or take the actions they prescribe to everyone else,\u201d he said in a press release.\n\nSen. Inhofe\u2019s Top 5 Winners of \u2018Climate Hypocrite Awards\u2019 Announced \u2013 #5: Mann #4: Obama #3: Climate summit Attendees #2: AOC #1: Al Gore https://t.co/cjJKgqFfRT \u2014 Marc Morano (@ClimateDepot) September 27, 2019\n\nMr. Inhofe, who famously tossed a snowball on the Senate floor in 2015 in a dig at global-warming alarm, gave out five awards, one for each day of Global Climate Week, culminating in Friday\u2019s \u201cgrand prize\u201d to Mr. Gore.\n\n\u201cLast, but certainly not least, Gore has earned the grand prize of America\u2019s greatest climate hypocrite,\u201d Mr. Inhofe said in a press release. \u201cWhether it\u2019s Gore\u2019s chartered jets around the country or the fact his home uses up to 34 times more energy than the average American household, he\u2019s never wavered in his calls for everyone else to, \u2018\u2026make [environmental] changes in their own lives.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Gore, who had no public comment on the jab, has been criticized for the energy demands of his 10,070-square-foot Nashville mansion, which in September 2016 burned through 34 times more electricity than the national monthly average, according to the National Center for Public Policy Research.\n\nThe Democratic climate standard-bearer\u2019s house does have 33 solar panels, but they produce only 5.7% of the annual energy used at the home, which includes a heated pool and security gate, the center said.\n\nComing in second was Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, sponsor of the Green New Deal resolution, who was dinged by the New York Post for her airplane and car travel, despite her calls for replacing combustion-vehicle engines with mass transit and electric vehicles.\n\n\u201cHer radical Green New Deal would put countless Americans out of work \u2013 it would end America as we know it \u2013 but AOC doesn\u2019t think twice about living lavishly in her luxury apartment building, taking a car one mile to work, and believing her $174,000 taxpayer-funded salary should be higher,\u201d said Mr. Inhofe.\n\nHer 2018 House campaign listed 1,049 transactions on apps like Lyft and Uber, and spent nearly $30,000 on rideshares, vans and rentals, versus $8,335 on MetroCards, \u201ceven though her Queens HQ was a one-minute walk to the 7 train,\u201d the Post reported.\n\nThe New York Democrat was defiant, tweeting in March that she also takes airplanes and uses air conditioning, and that \u201c[l]iving in the world as it is isn\u2019t an argument against working towards a better future.\u201d\n\nThe senator also gave awards to \u201cClimate Conference Attendees,\u201d the Obamas, and Penn State climatologist Michael E. Mann, who swung back with a series of tweets by accusing Mr. Inhofe of promoting a false narrative at the behest of the oil-and-gas industry and calling him a \u201cshameless liar.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnderstand what @JimInhofe & other fossil fuel industry tools are doing. They know their claims are false,\u201d Mr. Mann tweeted. \u201cThey\u2019re simply trying to create an echo-chamber of \u2018alternative facts\u2019 promoted by their base & built on lies. Our children & grandchildren are the victims. It is pure evil.\u201d\n\nUnderstand what @JimInhofe & other fossil fuel industry tools are doing. They know their claims are false.
