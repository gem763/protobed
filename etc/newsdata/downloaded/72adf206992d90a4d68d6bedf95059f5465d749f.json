An ad with the code will pop up at on the bottom of the screen during relevant moments of the show. If you\u2019d like to purchase the product, you can point your camera at the code and you\u2019ll end up following an affiliate link to the sponsor\u2019s e-commerce site.\n\nSo far, NBCU has tested this with sponsors like Lacoste during the French Open, Walmart on Today, Roli on NBC\u2019s \u201cSongland\u201d and Zwift during the Tour de France. In some cases, the announcers are explicitly pointing viewers toward the ad. In others, it just shows up in the bottom-third of the screen.\n\nNow NBCU is officially taking the ad unit out of beta testing, and plans to start using it across its unscripted programming, including Sunday Night Football.\n\nThe company also said it has already been reaching tens of millions of viewers with the unit, resulting in an average conversion rate that\u2019s nearly 30% higher than the e-commerce industry benchmark, and in 10% growth rates on social media.\n\nWhen I discussed the format with NBCUniversal executives Josh Feldman and Collette Winn, they argued that not only are the ads performing for advertisers, but also delivering a better experience for viewers, too.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not searching for the item \u2026 what you\u2019re seeing is what you\u2019re able to buy,\u201d Winn said. \u201cIt\u2019s not in your face. It\u2019s brought in really seamlessly.\u201d\n\nAnd if you\u2019re worried about product ads suddenly flooding your favorite shows, Winn noted that it will be limited to one brand per program.\n\nShe also said NBCU is experimenting with how these formats might show up in different devices \u2014 for example, on an internet-connected TV, where the ad might incorporate more interactions with the remote.", "description": "NBCUniversal has been testing a new ad unit that allows viewers to buy \u2014 directly from their phone \u2014 products featured on the show they\u2019re watching.
