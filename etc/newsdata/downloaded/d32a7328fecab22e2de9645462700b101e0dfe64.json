In this case, the Oppo Reno 10x Zoom follows the release of the impressive OnePlus 7 Pro. But for the first time, Oppo\u2019s phone might actually be better.\n\nAlthough the usual move has been for OnePlus to build a higher-spec phone around a mid-range Oppo chassis or screen design and strip down the software, that\u2019s not what\u2019s happened here. The Reno 10x Zoom is every bit as high-end and performant as the OnePlus 7 Pro, but with advantages and disadvantages of its own.\n\nFor my money, I think I\u2019d take the Oppo. At least if I lived outside the US.\n\nOur review of Oppo Reno Verge Score 8.5 out of 10 Good Stuff Great, versatile camera\n\nSpeedy performance\n\nStrong battery life Bad Stuff Screen is only good, not great\n\nBig and heavy\n\nZoom camera struggles in low light\n\nAs we\u2019ll get into later, \u201cOppo Reno 10x Zoom\u201d is a bad name for reasons beyond its simple unwieldiness, so I\u2019m just going to call this phone the Reno from here on out. (Not to be confused with the non-zooming variant of this phone, which also has a slower processor. There\u2019s also a 5G version of the 10x Zoom called the Oppo Reno 5G.)\n\nThe Reno is roughly the same size and shape as the OnePlus 7 Pro, with a similar curved back and a front panel dominated by a huge 6.6-inch screen. The screen doesn\u2019t slope on the sides, which is probably what accounts for the slightly smaller measurement. At 9.3mm thick, the Reno is half a millimeter thicker than the OnePlus Pro 7 and weighs slightly more at 210g. This doesn\u2019t bother me, but I have gigantic hands. Even my iPhone XS Max felt small after a few days using the Reno. Let me be very clear that like the OnePlus 7 Pro, this is a Big Phone for Big Phone People.\n\nIt\u2019s also quite an attractive one, with a sleek frosted glass finish that\u2019s broken by a strip for the Oppo logo and another for the cameras. There\u2019s no camera bump at all, which is welcome given the thickness of the device; a small nubbin below the cameras prevents them from coming into contact with any flat surface you might place the phone on. There\u2019s no headphone jack, either, but thankfully Oppo is using USB-C on the Reno \u2014 not a given for this company \u2014 and includes a pair of reasonably good in-ear buds. The only nit I have to pick about the Reno\u2019s build quality is that the volume buttons feel a little loose, which is surprising from a company that tends to put an emphasis on tactile clickiness.\n\nAs you\u2019d expect from a Chinese flagship phone in 2019, the Reno is a near-as-dammit bezel-less device without a notch. The border around the screen is slightly thicker on the bottom edge than the other three, but it\u2019s still only about the same thickness as an iPhone XR bezel. There\u2019s an optical fingerprint sensor integrated into the display, which I\u2019ve found to be very fast and reliable, and the earpiece is subtly integrated into the top edge of the phone.\n\nThe Reno\u2019s bezel-less design is completed by a 16-megapixel pop-up selfie camera that\u2019s by far the weirdest one I\u2019ve seen yet. Instead of raising the entire top of the phone itself, as on Oppo\u2019s own Find X from last year, or the more common approach of integrating a small square-ish module into the phone\u2019s top edge, the Reno\u2019s selfie camera is housed inside a lopsided section that rises from the right-hand corner of the display like a shark fin. It\u2019s startlingly asymmetrical, but the larger moving part means there\u2019s also room for a separate LED flash alongside the camera.\n\nWhile Oppo has already demonstrated that it\u2019s working on under-display cameras, at least the company is keeping things interesting until that technology arrives. And the headline feature of the Reno is another trick that Oppo has been showing off in prototype form for a while: the supposedly \u201c10x\u201d periscope zoom camera.\n\nLet\u2019s get into that camera, because before I tell you that it\u2019s awesome and fun to use, I also have to tell you that it really isn\u2019t a 10x zoom lens. Here\u2019s how it works: in the camera app, you can press a zoom button to go to 2x digital zoom, then 6x optical zoom, then 10x \u201chybrid zoom\u201d, the latter of which is ostensibly an AI-enhanced advance on the 6x setting. That\u2019s fair enough, but there isn\u2019t really a 6x optical zoom lens either \u2014 if you start zooming in from 1x with a slide gesture you can clearly see the image switch to the zoom lens at 5x.\n\nYou can go all the way to 60x with software-enhanced zooming if you really want, so Oppo\u2019s fixation on the 10x setting for the literal name of the phone feels misleading \u2014 not to mention that this phone really has three prime lenses with software to fill in the gaps, rather than an actual zoom lens. But even a 5x telephoto lens is a pretty transformative thing to add to a phone, as we saw with the Huawei P30 Pro. Oppo\u2019s version is at least as good, and has the advantage of not being imminently torpedoed from sale.\n\nIn good light, the Reno turns in sharp, well-exposed 13-megapixel zoom shots that simply wouldn\u2019t have been possible on previous smartphones. The feature isn\u2019t really usable in low light, however. The 5x zoom lens is optically stabilized, which helps with shaky hands during the day, but can\u2019t make up for the slow aperture of f/3 \u2014 your results will be pretty blurry at night. Huawei\u2019s 5x zoom camera is even slower at f/3.4, however, with a lower resolution of 8 megapixels.\n\nThe Reno also has an 8-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide camera and uses Sony\u2019s popular 48-megapixel IMX586 sensor with an f/1.7 lens for the primary camera, shooting pixel-binned 12-megapixel shots by default. Overall, I\u2019m very happy with the cameras\u2019 performance and Oppo\u2019s image processing. I spent most of my time testing the phone during a sunny week in Taipei for Computex, and it never let me down. Its low-light performance is great, its dedicated night mode is effective in even lower light, and its daylight colors are well-balanced. Although it doesn\u2019t perform the mind-bending HDR gymnastics of a Pixel, you\u2019ll almost always get punchy and dynamic results that retain a ton of detail. By the end of the week, I was using my Sony RX100 Mark IV a lot less than I\u2019d planned on.\n\nThe Reno uses a Snapdragon 855 processor, and subjectively feels like the fastest Android phone I\u2019ve ever used. A big part of that is down to Oppo\u2019s new ColorOS 6 software, which sees the company move away from its heavier Android skin to produce something more in line with OnePlus\u2019 OxygenOS. Animations are snappy, customizations are relatively mild, and there\u2019s even a slide-up app drawer out of the box. Oppo also deserves credit for putting a legitimately good haptic feedback system in the Reno, which remains rare among Android manufacturers and even rarer among Chinese OEMs.\n\nColorOS still does take a lot of inspiration from iOS, to be clear \u2014 its iPhone X-style multitasking system is very slick, while its bubbly notifications are less so. But overall, I don\u2019t think anyone beyond hardcore Android purists would have major issues with this software.\n\nThe big compromise is the screen\n\nI haven\u2019t had any issues with battery life, either, which is just as well considering the sheer size of this phone. I definitely put the 4,065mAh battery through its paces while covering Computex, which involves a whole lot of web browsing, productivity software, and photography on the go, and I never once needed to get my USB-C battery pack out of my bag. I wouldn\u2019t say the Reno is doing anything groundbreaking with battery life, but it\u2019s a phone you can trust to get you through the day. It also supports Oppo\u2019s VOOC 3.0 fast charging, which is the same system that OnePlus uses and works very well if you remember to bring the right power brick and cable.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the catch? Well, like OnePlus, Oppo still isn\u2019t supporting wireless charging. That\u2019ll be a big deal to anyone who\u2019s dotted their house in charging mats, and less of a big deal to anyone who still plugs in their phone all the time. (I fall into the former camp.)\n\nThe other big compromise is in the screen. Oppo isn\u2019t using the OnePlus 7 Pro\u2019s amazing 90Hz 1440p OLED display here, which in other words means it doesn\u2019t match that phone\u2019s most compelling selling point. The Reno\u2019s panel is also 1080p, which isn\u2019t something I would usually ding a phone for \u2014 Samsung sets its 1440p phones to render at 1080p by default for a reason. But the Reno\u2019s huge display is just past the size where such a compromise is occasionally noticeable. It\u2019s a great screen in terms of contrast and color rendition, but it isn\u2019t class-leading overall.\n\nThe Oppo Reno 10x Zoom costs \u00a3699 in the UK for a model with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, which positions it directly against the equivalent OnePlus 7 Pro. These phones are clearly both peas from the same pod. I think they are equally good on their own merits. For most people, which one you prefer will come down to whether you would rather have an incredible screen or a game-changing camera.\n\nMe? I\u2019d go with the camera. This phone is the result of something that Oppo has been promising for years, and the final product seriously delivers. The Reno 10x Zoom has very few flaws, hits all the right notes you\u2019d expect from a flagship phone, and lands a few unique features of its own.\n\nI\u2019ve tested a lot of Oppo devices in recent years, and I was truly surprised by how much I enjoyed using this phone. Last year\u2019s Find X was where many people around the world started paying attention, but the Reno is easily the best phone Oppo has ever released, marking the point where it becomes a legitimate high-end brand that\u2019s worthy of serious consideration.\n\nPhotography by Sam Byford / The Verge", "description": "Oppo\u2019s new Reno smartphone is lot like the OnePlus 7 Pro, but it has a even more impressive camera.
