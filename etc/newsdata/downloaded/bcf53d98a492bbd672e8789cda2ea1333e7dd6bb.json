Now, he has filed a lawsuit against the NFL team for mistakenly banning him from attending games.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nSmith received a call from the Browns organization following the team's early September loss to the Tennessee Titans, telling him that he was banned from FirstEnergy Stadium for pouring a beer on Titans defensive back Logan Ryan after a touchdown against the Browns.\n\nThe problem with what might appear to be a rational and proportionate response lies in the fact that Smith claims that he wasn\u2019t at the game. In his lawsuit, which was filed on Monday, Smith notes that at the time that Ryan was getting doused by an adult beverage, he wasn\u2019t anywhere close to the stadium.\n\nAccording to the court filing on Tuesday, Smith\u2019s lawsuit seeks damages \u201cin excess of $25,000\u201d At the time of the incident, Smith \"was at his home relaxing with his wife and kids before he left around 3 p.m. to DJ a wedding,\u201d the lawsuit claims.\n\nSmith says he has a mobile app that shows he didn't leave his residence until 2:57 P.M. that day.\n\nNot only was Smith not at the season opener, he hasn\u2019t attended a Browns game since 2010, and instead of the apology he sought, he was offered only tickets.\n\nThe suit names the Cleveland Browns and their related entities as well as First Energy Stadium and the NFL\u2019s security division. Noting the details of the Browns 43-13 loss that day, the plaintiff notes that the team \u201ccommitted an obscene amount of penalties and turnovers.\u201d\n\nOnly a true fan would include such painful details.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Eric Brown says he was banned from the Cleveland Browns stadium when the team wrongly accused of him of pouring beer on an opposing player.", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/FirstEnergy-Stadium-iStock.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
