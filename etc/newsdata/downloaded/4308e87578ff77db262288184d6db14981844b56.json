They\u2019d much prefer to leave the outcome of the 2020 election in the hands of the Beltway establishment and the elite-approved media. This Ukraine \u201cscandal\u201d is merely a vehicle to allow them to do the latter and avoid the former.\n\nLet me be clear: There was nothing illegal, improper, or even remotely impeachable about my father\u2019s phone call with President Zelensky.\n\nHunter Biden, on the other hand, took a $600,000-a-year job with a notoriously corrupt foreign company despite being woefully unqualified. This was almost certainly due entirely to his father\u2019s perceived influence as the Vice President of the United States at the time \u2014 the same influence the elder Biden used, by his own admission, to pressure Ukraine into firing the prosecutor investigating his son\u2019s firm.\n\nThat needs to be investigated, as does the equally suspicious circumstances surrounding Hunter\u2019s trip to China with his father while Hunter was in the midst of negotiations for $1.5 billion in Chinese cash. Fortunately, Senator Lindsey Graham has pledged to invite Rudy Giuliani to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, so we\u2019ll soon know a lot more about those shady dealings.\n\nWhatever role Ukrainian nationals and firms operating in Ukraine may have played in laying the groundwork for what became the Russiagate hoax also must be investigated. My father has said this, publicly. Attorney General Bill Barr has said this, publicly. His subordinates at the Justice Department have said this, publicly.\n\nWhy on Earth would anyone be surprised that my father would ask foreign leaders with the ability to assist those investigations to do so? Considering that the same Democrats who are now clamoring for impeachment themselves asked the Ukrainians to assist in investigating my father, how can any of them claim with a straight face that my father acted improperly, let alone call for his impeachment?\n\nAs Sen. Graham\u2019s hearings will no doubt reveal, corruption has been endemic in Ukraine for many years. It would have been downright irresponsible for the President of the United States to ignore that issue before handing over hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars.\n\nIn short, none of them actually believe this nonsense. The Democrats are simply hoping to tarnish my father\u2019s political standing before the voters have to start evaluating the choice between Donald Trump and whichever far-left radical the Democrats nominate to run against him.\n\nIndeed, the left\u2019s hysterical reactions to Ukrainegate are just recitations of the same attacks they\u2019ve been making since before my father was even elected.\n\nDeranged lawyer George Conway just wrote a rambling, 11,000+ word opinion article pretending to be a psychologist judging my father as mentally unfit for office. J.W. Verret, who briefly served on my father\u2019s transition team, is convinced that Ukrainegate is worse than Watergate \u2014 \u201ca lot worse,\u201d in fact.\n\nLiberal journalist Paul Brandus goes even further. Not only is my father \u201cmuch worse than Richard Nixon,\u201d Brandus contends that he\u2019s actually a traitor to America!\n\nDoesn\u2019t this sound familiar? It should.\n\nWorse than Watergate? Anyone making that claim this week is obviously slow on the draw. Watergate one-hit wonder Carl Bernstein was using the \u201cworse than Watergate\u201d line back in November 2017. One of the men who wound up in prison as a result of Bernstein\u2019s reporting, John Dean, was convinced that my father had breached the \u201cworse than Watergate\u201d wall in May 2017, just four months after taking the oath of office.\n\nGeorge Conway thinks my father is unfit for his office? The same USA Today editorial board that published Brandus\u2019s \u201ctreason\u201d claim broke decades of policy to say the exact same thing \u2026 in September 2016, before my father was even elected.\n\nSpeaking of treason, NBC News was accusing my father of treason in July 2016 \u2014 before he was even the Republican nominee \u2014 over a joke. It only took another year for the Democrats to accuse me of the same thing without a shred of truth.\n\nYet, they expect you to believe their latest hysterics about a phone call with Ukraine. It\u2019s a joke, and not a very funny one, at that. Even the people making the claims reveal so much with their own behavior. J.W. Verret \u2014 a professor whom the media is presenting as a former Trump supporter won over by the evidence of wrongdoing in Ukrainegate \u2014 was calling for impeachment months ago, when this Ukraine \u201cwhistleblower\u201d scheme wasn\u2019t even a twinkle in Adam Schiff\u2019s eye.\n\nSchiff, the Jussie Smollet of American politics, is trying to make this about Ukraine. As I hope you can see, it just doesn\u2019t wash. This impeachment farce is solely about preventing a repeat of the greatest political embarrassment in the modern history of the Democratic Party: my father\u2019s victory in 2016.\n\nThe prospect that the Democrats will be able to unseat my father in a fair election are fading fast. Hunter Biden\u2019s scandals, along with a series of embarrassing gaffes and apparent \u201csenior moments\u201d on the debate stage have crippled the Democrats\u2019 putative front-runner, Joe Biden. The corresponding ascendance of Senator Elizabeth Warren makes it increasingly likely that the Democrats will nominate a candidate from the Party\u2019s far-left wing, which is woefully out of step with the American mainstream.\n\nDemocrats evidently feel that the 2020 presidential election cannot be left to chance. They don\u2019t want to give the American people the option of making the same \u201cmistake\u201d twice. Nothing else adequately explains this impeachment push.\n\nMichael Anton famously wrote at the time that 2016 was the \u201cFlight 93\u201d election \u2014 the final chance for Americans to regain control over the airplane of state before it fell forever into the hands of Hillary Clinton and her vast network of swamp creatures, who would create conditions under which the people would never be able to choose their own destiny again.\n\nThree years ago, Americans rose to the occasion. They chose the future they wanted, and, since January 2017, my father has worked tirelessly to deliver it to them. The would-be impeachers on Capitol Hill are desperately trying, as they have throughout, to take that choice back and ensure that the American people are never given such an opportunity for autonomy again.\n\nThey are trying to use the Ukraine hoax to override the will of the people, and they aren\u2019t even being subtle about it.\n\nDonald Trump, Jr. is the Executive Vice President at The Trump Organization.", "description": "Democrats are trying to use the Ukraine hoax to override the will of the people, and they aren\u2019t even being subtle about it.", "authors": ["Donald Trump Jr."], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/05/Donald-Trump-Jr-1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
