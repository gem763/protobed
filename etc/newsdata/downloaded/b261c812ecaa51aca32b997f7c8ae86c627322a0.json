It is a level of disregard for human life that the vast majority of decent people in America cannot comprehend.\n\nYet, we seem to have a political stage full of such abjectly depraved people. It is so bad that these people may as well support live-birth abortion. Oh, wait. They do.\n\nAs despicable as it was watching all the Democrats running for president scramble over dead bodies to offer the first and most depraved reactions to the recent shootings, it was a political thug in Philadelphia who proved to be the worst.\n\nSix cops were shot last week while risking their lives to make the city safer. A gunman held the officers at bay for hours.\n\nThe cesspool city\u2019s mayor \u2014 a man named Jim Kenney \u2014 flew to the microphones to level blame for the shooting and demand justice.\n\nDid he blame the shooter? The shooter\u2019s parents, who obviously raised some kind of monster? Did he blame his city for the culture of crime that it inspires? Did he blame the pervasive message pushed by his fellow politicians that cops are racist and evil?\n\nNo. He blamed law-abiding gun owners.\n\n\u201cIf the state and federal government don\u2019t want to stand up to the NRA and some other folks, then let us,\u201d he harangued.\n\n\u201cBut they preempt us on all kinds of gun control legislation. Our officers deserve to be protected and they don\u2019t deserve to be shot by a guy for hours with an unlimited supply of weapons and an unlimited supply of bullets.\u201d\n\nNow, remember, for dumb and dishonest politicians like Mr. Kenney, the NRA is just a boogeyman stand-in for \u201claw-abiding gun owners\u201d across America. These dumb and dishonest politicians attack the NRA because they know they won\u2019t pay a political price for attacking the NRA, while they would be roundly spanked for attacking lawful citizens across the country.\n\nThe truth is that if there is any political blame for any shooting, then the shooting of six Philadelphia cops lies directly at the feet of Mayor Jim Kenney himself. Literally, the blood of those cops is on his hands.\n\nNow we can talk all day about what made shooter Maurice Hill such a monster, but there is no mystery as to why a hardened criminal like him had \u201can unlimited supply of weapons and an unlimited supply of bullets,\u201d which he used to send six police officers to the hospital.\n\nIt is because prosecutors and judges and politicians in Philadelphia \u2014 powerful people like Mr. Kenney \u2014 have so little regard for human life, especially the lives of cops.\n\nRecords show what Mr. Hill has been arrested more than a dozen times since he turned 18 in 2001. The charges against him range from kidnapping to attempted murder. Yet most startling are the number of times he has been arrested and charged for \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 illegal gun possession.\n\nMore staggering is the number of times those charges were simply dropped by prosecutors in Philadelphia.\n\nIf gun laws are truly the answer to gun violence in America \u2014 and in many cases they are \u2014 then let\u2019s start with the simple, obvious ones. If you violate gun laws, you will be charged and you will be prosecuted and you will pay the price. In the case of Mr. Hill, you would be in jail.\n\nAnd six Philadelphia cops would not have been shot last week.\n\n\u2022 Contact Charles Hurt at [email protected] or on Twitter @charleshurt.\n\nSign up for Charles Hurt's Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
