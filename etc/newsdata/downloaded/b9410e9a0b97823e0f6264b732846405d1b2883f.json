I\u2019ve definitely felt pressure from people \u2013 people I don\u2019t know, and even people I do know.\u2019\n\nStacey is now dating Joe Swash, who she met on I\u2019m A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here in 2016.\n\nThe television personality gave birth to her and Joe\u2019s first child in May of this year and Joe took to her Instagram and made us all well up with tears.\n\nHe wrote: \u2018This morning. A lot earlier than planned I watched the love of my life, bring a new life into the world. We are overwhelmed, overjoyed and apprehensive of what\u2019s to come.

So for now, I\u2019m going to spend the next few days and the rest of my life falling more in love with these two humans. I didn\u2019t think it possible but, today I witnessed the impossible. My partner, My love, my life, you are a super human. I am forever in awe.
