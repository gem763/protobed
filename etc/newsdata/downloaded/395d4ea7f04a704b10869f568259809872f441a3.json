It's the fifth time the road team has won each of the first four World Series games.\n\n\"We expected them to punch back,\" Nationals shortstop Trea Turner said, \"and they did.\"\n\nThe next starting pitching matchup was supposed to be a rematch of Game 1 in Houston, grabbed by Washington 5-4 as three-time Cy Young Award winner Max Scherzer earned the win and Cole took the loss.\n\nBut Scherzer was scratched from his scheduled start late Sunday afternoon due to spasms in his neck and back and replaced by fellow right-hander Joe Ross.\n\nCole heads into this outing in an unfamiliar position.\n\n\"The focus on the pitches just continues to just raise across the board,\" Cole said. \"And so you have to deal with that. You have to respond to that.\"\n\nGerrit's not really the guy who's going to lose twice in a row. \u2014 Astros outfielder Josh Reddick on ace pitcher Gerrit Cole\n\nHe had not taken an \"L\" since May, going 19-0 over his previous 25 starts.\n\nThis is a guy who led the majors in strikeouts and was second in wins during the regular season, going 20-5 with 326 Ks and a 2.50 earned-run average, and is expected to land a deal worth perhaps $200 million US as a free agent.\n\n\"Gerrit's not really the guy who's going to lose twice in a row,\" Astros outfielder Josh Reddick said.\n\nOn Sunday, he will face a Nationals offence that is slumping, with a grand total of two runs over the past two nights.\n\nWATCH | Astros pull even with Nationals in Game 4:\n\nAlex Bregman hit a 7th inning grand slam in Game 4 to help the Houston Astros dump the Washington Nationals 8-1 and tie the World Series 2-2. 1:53\n\nThe way Cole described what happened in Game 1, when he allowed five runs in seven innings?\n\n\"I didn't have my A-game,\" Cole said then.\n\nWorking away from strike zone\n\nScherzer navigated his way in and out of trouble that night, giving up two runs in five innings.\n\nIn 2019, the Nationals are 4-0 in his appearances, including three as a starter and one out of the bullpen.\n\nUntil Sunday, Scherzer had not shown any effects from the upper-back problem that put him on the injured list for about a month during the season.\n\n\"All those back issues, I have to really address in the off-season. ... How I'm going to train and everything,\" Scherzer said. \"So I've been dreaming up different things I might be doing this December and January to really address that.\"\n\nCole, on the other hand, wants to keep things tilting Houston's way.\n\n\"It's always fun to compete against the best,\" said Alex Bregman, who had an RBI single in the first inning and a grand slam in the seventh Saturday. \"We've got two of the best pitchers in the game facing off tomorrow in the World Series, tied 2-2. It's a lot of fun.\"", "description": "Houston right-hander Gerrit Cole, coming off his first loss since May in the World Series opener, leads his team into Sunday's pivotal Game 5 at 8:07 p.m. ET against a Washington offence that is slumping and won't have ace Max Scherzer on the mound.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5337382.1572195629!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/cole-gerrit-191015-1180.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
