In the video, Younger asks his son, \u201cYou\u2019re a boy, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d James replied. \u201cI\u2019m a girl.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho told you you\u2019re a girl?\u201d the father asked.\n\n\u201cMommy,\u201d the boy responded.\n\n\u201cSo, Mommy told you you\u2019re a girl?\u201d Younger asked.\n\n\u201cUh huh,\u201d James said.\n\nIn response to his father\u2019s questions, James said his mother puts dresses on him, paints his nails, and puts hair clips in his hair.\n\n\u201cShe tells me I\u2019m a girl,\u201d James said.\n\n\u201cDo you think you\u2019re a girl?\u201d Jeffrey asked his son.\n\n\u201cUh huh,\u201d the boy replied.\n\nJames is at the center of a high-conflict custody battle between Younger and his ex-wife, Dr. Anne Georgulas, a pediatrician who reportedly diagnosed James with \u201cgender-dysphoria,\u201d a psychological disorder that is characterized by a child\u2019s \u201cpersistent, consistent, and insistent\u201d assertion of \u201ctheir cross-gender statements and behaviors.\u201d\n\nA jury in Dallas decided Monday against Younger\u2019s attempt to block his ex-wife\u2019s plan to start their seven-year-old son on puberty blockers and ultimately continue with cross-sex hormones in order to facilitate gender transition.\n\nThe case has created a firestorm as more evidence is revealing the psychological and physical damage that is done to young children when their parents consent to puberty blockers before the children are capable of understanding the consequences.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has documented thousands of deaths in adults linked to hormone blocker Lupron \u2014 one that is now used as a puberty-blocker for children who suffer from gender dysphoria or claim to be \u201ctransgender.\u201d\n\nLupron is being used \u2014 without formal FDA approval \u2014 as a puberty blocker on the increasing number of children and adolescents who are being diagnosed in the U.S. and the U.K. with gender dysphoria. This is being done \u2014 with the support of the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Endocrine Society \u2014 despite the fact there is no evidence that such hormonal treatments actually benefit children and adolescents with the psychological disorder.\n\nThe jury decided Georgulas has full authority to continue to \u201ctransition\u201d James who is being renamed \u201cLuna,\u201d reported LifeSiteNews.\n\nAccording to the report, a consensus of 11 of 12 jurors decided the current joint managing conservatorship over the twin sons of Georgulas and Younger should be replaced by sole managing conservatorship by Georgulas.\n\nThe battle between Younger and Georgulas intensified last year when James\u2019s mother threatened Younger with a child abuse charge because he would not affirm their son is a transgender child.\n\nGeorgulas petitioned to modify the parent-child relationship while referring to James as a \u201cgender expansive or transgender child\u201d who \u201cby choice, now goes by the name Luna.\u201d\n\nJames\u2019s mother sought to terminate Younger\u2019s parental rights because James behaved as a boy when he was with his father. Georgulas also wanted Younger to pay for their son\u2019s counseling with a therapist who will affirm his transgender identity and his need for transgender hormonal treatments, which may begin at age eight.\n\nThe court prohibited Younger from dressing him as a boy or from sharing faith-based or biologically-based scientific teachings on sexuality, even though family friends who have observed James when he is in his father\u2019s care reportedly affirm he dresses and behaves as a boy by his own choosing.\n\nJames\u2019s \u201ctransition therapist\u201d reportedly continued to identify him as \u201cLuna\u201d and to place him on track for gender transition.\n\nAccording to the Texan, Younger and Georgulas were married in 2010 and decided to have children through in vitro fertilization (IVF).\n\n\u201cThey requested male children through the IVF process that was successful, and their twin boys were born in 2012,\u201d the Texan reported and added:\n\nBecause of a family tradition to name the male children with the initials \u201cJ.D.Y.,\u201d and because of the biblical reference to the brothers of Jesus, Younger and Georgulas decided to name the children James and Jude. At the time, both parents were members of the Orthodox Church.\n\nGeorgulas has reportedly said James began to imitate female characters from the Disney film Frozen. She said he asked for a girls\u2019 toy at McDonald\u2019s and asked to wear dresses, according to the report.\n\nThe mother reportedly said she contacted the GENecis clinic at Children\u2019s Hospital Center. She was then referred to Rebekka Ouer for counseling, who recommended a process of \u201caffirmation\u201d and suggested a \u201csocial transition\u201d for James should begin with the young child going to school dressed as a girl named \u201cLuna.\u201d\n\nThe battle reportedly escalated between the two parents when Younger learned Georgulas was \u201csocially transitioning\u201d James.", "description": "Jeffrey Younger has shared a video of his son at three years of age in which he tells his father, \u201cMommy tells me I\u2019m a girl.\u201d", "authors": ["Dr. Susan Berry"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/dr-anne-georgulas-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
