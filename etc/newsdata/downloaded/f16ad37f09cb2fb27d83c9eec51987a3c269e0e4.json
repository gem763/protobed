And though she\u2019s bravely soldiering on, she\u2019s still deeply distressed and misses her boy, Nandia Neethling says.\n\n\u201cI get up and light a candle by a picture of his toys,\u201d says Nandia from Panorama, Cape Town. \u201cPeople told me to light a candle for him and I think that\u2019s brought me some comfort.\u201d\n\nYOU earlier reported that Nandia\u2019s late husband, Johann (69), had gone into the bedroom of their son Dylan (7) in the early hours of 8 September and shot the sleeping boy. Before turning the gun on himself, Johann called the police to report a shooting,\n\nNandia and Johann were estranged and Dylan spent every second weekend with his dad.\n\nNandia says she\u2019s keeping her son\u2019s ashes in a cupboard at the flat where she now lives. \u201cSometimes, it\u2019s strange to think his ashes are in the cupboard. I\u2019m still deciding what I want to do with it.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s taken in Dylan\u2019s pet hedgehog and rabbit and the animals are giving her some comfort. Dylan\u2019s dog and cat now stay with her parents in Ceres.\n\n\u201cMy friends and their parents are wonderful and they\u2019re giving me a lot of support. My brother, Rudi, is my rock,\u201d she says.\n\nBut Nandia is finding life without her son extremely hard. To make matters worse, she\u2019s come to realise how much Johann hated her.\n\nHis daughter from a previous marriage has handed her a package of photo albums. \u201cWhen I opened it, many of the pictures had been cut up. He scribbled the most horrible things in all the albums. In our wedding pictures, he scratched out my face and the faces of my parents.\n\n\u201cIn one of Dylan\u2019s Grade 1 pictures he\u2019d cut my son out of the picture and in one of the albums he wrote that he wishes me only unhappiness in life.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again: I\u2019m not going to let him destroy me. He wanted to break me down and I won\u2019t let him.\n\n\u201cMy life was spared. I still have a purpose in the world and there\u2019s a future ahead of me.\u201d", "description": "Last Tuesday it was a month since her son died.
