He confirmed last week: \"Clearly this is a very important and serious topic.\n\n\"I propose to engage with the DWP to establish what information it holds, how that information is produced, and how it is stored, accessed and used.\n\n\"Hopefully this will help you understand the DWP's response to your question.\"\n\nMr Field said: \"I struggle to believe that, given the amount of time it must take to put together evidence for inquests, attend court hearings, and internally review the decisions to see what part the DWP policy may have played in a claimant taking their own life, there is no record of such.\n\n\"It shocks me even more that the Department is apparently unconcerned with the most drastic effects of its policies and conducts no internal monitoring of the tragedies in which it could be complicit.\n\n\u201cWhat does it tell us that DWP does not collect this data?\"\n\nA DWP spokeswoman said: \u201cThe death of a claimant is always a tragedy and whilst this is not an inquiry, we will engage with the NAO on this important topic.\u201d\n\nThe Samaritans is available 24/7 if you need to talk.
