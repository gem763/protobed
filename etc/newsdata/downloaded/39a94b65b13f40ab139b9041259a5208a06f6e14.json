BP announced the disposal programme following its $10.25 billion acquisition of BHP's shale business last year, its largest purchase in three decades.\n\nThe planned third-quarter impairment charges are expected to increase BP's gearing - the ratio between debt and market capitalisation - to the top end of the 20% to 30% target, BP said.\n\nDebt levels and gearing are expected to move to the middle of the range through 2020.\n\nBP's third-quarter oil and gas production will be impacted by maintenance in some high-margin regions, BP said.\n\nOutput in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico was \"significantly disrupted\" by Hurricane Barry, with facilities shut down for around 14 days.\n\nBP is scheduled to report its results on October 29.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Ron Bousso; editing by Jason Neely)", "description": "BP will take charges of $2 to $3 billion in the third quarter, the British energy firm said on Friday, as it looks to reach divestments worth $10 billion by the end of 2019, a year ahead of schedule.
