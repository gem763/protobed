It was deep into the afternoon , and Mr. Parikh, a founder of the direct-to-consumer mattress start-up Casper, was looking at the menu of a Midtown Manhattan coffee shop, debating whether it was too late for another cappuccino.\n\n\u201cThis whole week, basically, I\u2019ve been in the toilet \u2014 I had a 57, a 59,\u201d he said, sighing. He was referring to readings taken by a silver band, called an Oura, that was on his right ring finger and tracks things like R.E.M. sleep and heart rate and returns a \u201creadiness\u201d score out of 100.\n\nStanding next to Mr. Parikh was Dr. Frank Lipman, a sleep specialist who has been treating the executive for a year and a half. \u201cThat\u2019s not good,\u201d he said, frowning. \u201cI\u2019m usually in the high 80s, unless I sit up at night and watch Rachel Maddow.\u201d\n\nMr. Parikh, who has a Casper Wave model in his bed at home, settled on a decaf. It\u2019s not a great look for one of the top executives of a mattress company to seem haggard and kvetch about z\u2019s during prime working hours, but recently, Casper has quietly acknowledged that it\u2019s not enough to be a mere foam-slab company. The start-up needs a bigger market, and the concept it\u2019s embracing is sleep itself.", "description": "The start-up wants to be the \u2018Nike of sleep.\u2019 It\u2019s a slightly absurd concept \u2014 in a gigantic market.", "authors": ["Sheila Marikar"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/15/business/13Casper-illo/13Casper-illo-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
