While I\u2019ve never deluded myself into thinking of chocolate as a health food, say like antioxidant-rich kale, I believed \u2014 thanks to many published studies \u2014 that even one square of dark chocolate definitely had some health benefits.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen I did an Internet search, I found plenty of articles saying just that, including Healthline\u2019s \u201c7 Proven Benefits of Chocolate\u201d and the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s \u201cHeart Healthy Benefits of Chocolate.\u201d Articles like these (and many more) report that chocolate may lower the risk of certain cancers, lower blood pressure and reduce the risks of diabetes, stroke and heart disease.\n\nI even read that dark chocolate lowers the risk of depression and that it\u2019s counted \u2014 along with nuts, avocados and blueberries \u2014 as a \u201csuperfood.\u201d\n\nMucking up things, though, were other studies that suggest chocolate may increase our risk for other cancers, and we\u2019d be fools not to know that eating too much can lead to obesity (and the troublesome health conditions that follow in its wake).\n\nAD\n\nAs a journalist, I know better than to believe everything I read, especially if it\u2019s melting in my mouth. So I did a little investigating to get to the bottom of the question: Is chocolate healthy?\n\nAD\n\nThe top Google result for that question was a report (\u201cCan chocolate be good for my health?\u201d) on the Mayo Clinic website. To help me fact-check it, I called Marion Nestle, the \u00admuch-respected professor of food and nutrition studies at New York University, who has extensively studied the chocolate industry (most recently in her book \u201cUnsavory Truth: How Food Companies Skew the Science of What We Eat).\u201d\n\nI read Nestle (who is no relation to the candy maker) the article\u2019s lead paragraph, which states, in part, \u201cchocolate\u2019s reputation is on the rise, as a growing number of studies suggest that it can be a heart-healthy choice.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nShe stopped me right there to note that it\u2019s not chocolate but the flavanols in chocolate that might have potential benefits. Flavanols are abundant in cocoa beans, which yield cocoa powder, which is then used to make chocolate, she said.\n\nAD\n\nTo be fair, despite it\u2019s enticing headline, the Mayo article in fact does focus on the benefits of flavanols, not chocolate, notably their \u201cantioxidant effects that reduce cell damage implicated in heart disease . . . [and] also help lower blood pressure and improve vascular function.\u201d But will readers understand that the amount of flavanols in a chocolate bar is not nearly enough to affect their health? No, Nestle said with obvious exasperation: \u201cYou\u2019d have to eat an awful lot of chocolate to make a difference.\u201d\n\nNestle told me that if I eat more chocolate to up my flavanol intake, I\u2019m consuming a lot more calories and fat, as well \u2014 which will be bad for my health. That\u2019s because flavanol-rich cocoa has a bitter taste, so candy manufacturers add lots of fats and sugars to create commercial \u2014 delicious-tasting \u2014 chocolate.\n\nAD\n\nOne recent study reported that \u201chigher levels of chocolate consumption might be associated with a one-third reduction in the risk of developing cardiovascular disease.\u201d That sounds like great news, but the study authors point out that those benefits would require \u201cexcessive consumption,\u201d with the probable side effect of \u201cweight gain, a risk factor for hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidaemia,\u201d which increases the chance of clogged arteries and heart attacks, stroke, or other circulatory concerns, especially in smokers. Not so great.\n\nAD\n\nAlice Lichtenstein, a professor of nutrition science and policy at Tufts University, also said \u201cthe data don\u2019t support using [chocolate] as a health food.\u201d Why do so many think it is? \u201cIt sounds great so I think people like repeating it,\u201d she said.\n\nLichtenstein is critical of many of the studies, which she reminded me tend to come out right before Valentine\u2019s Day \u2014 our National Day of Chocolate. They \u201clack plausibility\u201d and are mostly \u201cobservational,\u201d she said, which means they can show that two variables are related to each other but can\u2019t prove cause and effect.\n\nAD\n\nAs an example, Lichtenstein pointed to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine that showed \u201ca very strong correlation between per capita chocolate intake and the number of Nobel prizes awarded in any country. Does that mean the more chocolate you eat, the more likely you are to win a Nobel Prize?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nI certainly hoped so, but Lichtenstein quashed my dream: \u201cObviously not.\u201d Correlation is not causation, she said, a fallacy many people fail to understand. Eating more chocolate will not make you smarter or boost your chances of winning a Nobel Prize. Sorry.\n\nFurther dashing my hopes, Lichtenstein said that there is some research \u201csuggesting biological effects, but those studies were done at high concentrations\u201d of flavanols. To make her point, she told me about a study in the journal Nature Neuroscience that concluded people who consumed a high dose of cocoa flavanols performed much better on a memory test than those on a low-flavanol mixture. Wow, I thought. But then she added that a person would have to eat about \u201cseven average-sized bars\u201d daily to consume enough flavanol for this possible benefit.\n\nAD\n\nThat study, it turned out, had other issues, notably that it had partial funding from Mars, the chocolate company.\n\nAD\n\nMarion Nestle said this isn\u2019t an isolated incident. Chocolate makers have long funded studies seeking to determine the health benefits of chocolate. A 2018 Vox report on more than 100 Mars-funded studies found overwhelmingly glowing conclusions about cocoa and chocolate \u2014 promoting everything from chocolate\u2019s heart health benefits to cocoa\u2019s ability to fight disease.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not impressed by the research that shows this [when] it is industry funded,\u201d Nestle said. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to take seriously.\u201d So take these studies with a grain of salt \u2014 but maybe not another square of chocolate.\n\nAD\n\nTo wrap up my \u201cinvestigation,\u201d I spoke to Katherine Zeratsky, a registered dietitian and licensed nutritionist at the Mayo Clinic and the author of \u201cCan chocolate be good for my health?\u201d\n\nIs it, I asked? \u201cI think it possibly can be,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like so many other foods, it probably depends on how it\u2019s consumed, how much is consumed. . . . \u201d From there, she moved quickly to the important difference between cocoa beans and chocolate, pointing out as Nestle had earlier that it\u2019s the flavanol-rich cocoa beans that \u201care potentially health promoting\u201d \u2014 not chocolate. (A Mayo Clinic representative told me that their \u201ccontent is not influenced in any way by benefactors and donations to Mayo Clinic.\u201d)\n\nAD\n\nThere\u2019s that problem again: With every delectable mouthful, the cocoa beans in chocolate offer tiny additional doses of flavanols \u2014 which are good for you \u2014 but far more additional fat, sugar and calories \u2014 which are bad. It\u2019s not a healthy trade-off.\n\nAD\n\nSo what\u2019s a chocoholic to do? First, stop thinking of chocolate as \u201chealthy.\u201d Nestle said she eats dark chocolate with nuts, but she\u2019s clear it\u2019s a treat.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a candy, and candy has a place in American diets,\u201d she said. \u201cThat place is moderation.\u201d\n\nZeratsky urged people to look for chocolate that is 65 percent or higher made from cocoa, \u201cwhere we may see some health benefits.\u201d That means only dark chocolate since milk chocolate doesn\u2019t have that much cocoa, which is how we measure \u201cdark.\u201d\n\nShe also recommended that we keep our chocolate intake to the American Heart Association\u2019s limit for discretionary calories \u2014 about 100 calories a day, or one square of dark chocolate. That yields about 140 milligrams of flavanols, below the level where you\u2019ll likely get any health benefits. Enjoy it, like I do, but know it\u2019s a treat.\n\nAD\n\nOkay, now you can unfriend me now.\n\nA closer look at this confectionery\n\nHere\u2019s your basic chocolate analysis.\n\nAll chocolate bars, and syrup, are made from the cocoa bean, also called cacao, which is the dried and fermented seed of Theobroma cacao, which consists of cocoa solids and butter. Chocolate is made from cocoa beans, which if you\u2019ve ever bitten into one, you know it\u2019s bitter. Very bitter.\n\nWhen it comes to labeling chocolate, it\u2019s done with a percentage such as \u201c45 percent cocoa,\u201d or \u201c70 percent cocoa.\u201d\n\nIn a 70 percent bar, which is a dark chocolate, more than two-thirds of the contents is derived from the beans, the nibs to be precise, with the remainder consisting of sugar, cocoa butter or vegetable oil. That makes dark chocolates taste less sweet to our palates than the milk chocolates, but also makes them less unhealthy (which is not the same as healthy).\n\nBy contrast, milk chocolate has a smaller percentage of cocoa beans than dark \u2014 and a higher percentage of cocoa butter and sugar \u2014 along with milk powder or condensed milk. White chocolate usually contains no cocoa powder \u2014 but lots of butter/oils, sugar and milk \u2014 which is why many people rightfully claim that white \u201cchocolate\u201d is an oxymoron.\n\nIt\u2019s those cocoa beans in chocolate that provide tiny doses of flavanols, which have some health benefits. So how much chocolate do we need to consume to get that benefit?", "description": "The flavanols in chocolate could have potential benefits.
