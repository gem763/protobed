As years pass, statutes of limitations in the states bar prosecution, making it much harder, if not impossible, to identify perpetrators and bring charges. Without the federal funding, advocates say, it\u2019s possible many of the rape kits might never be tested.\n\nChristian Science Monitor via Getty Images, FILE\n\nSince 2004, the Debbie Smith Act -- the name of the grants measure -- has been reauthorized with overwhelming bipartisan support. Almost 200,000 offenders have been identified because of the grant money, they said, and overall, the grant money is responsible for over 40% of all DNA matches since 2005. Funding for backlogged rape kits also comes from non-profits, local, and state funds.\n\n\u201cWe need Speaker Pelosi to step up and let the Judiciary Committee know that this is a priority,\u201d Scott Berkowitz, the president of the anti-sexual violence organization RAINN (Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network), said at a news conference on Friday.\n\nAlso on Friday, Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn urged House Democrats to re-authorize the funding. But complicating matters, House Democrats already have passed the funding as part of the Violence Against Women Act,re-authorization, a much larger piece of legislation, introduced back in April. While the VAWA measure has major support from Democrats, it has yet to pass the Republican-led Senate.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York, her spokesman told ABC News, is \"very committed\" to reauthorizing the funding.\n\nTesting rape kits is expensive. If the funding passes, local agencies could apply to receive some of the $151 million in grant money, which would go toward updating lab equipment, training, and testing backlogged rape kits.\n\nABC News\n\nThe measure was named after Debbie Smith, who was raped in Virginia in 1989 and DNA evidence helped convict her attacker six-and-a-half years later.\n\nAt the news conference Friday, she begged Congress to continue the funding.\n\n\"Hope is a powerful, mighty force in all of our lives,\u201d Smith said. \u201cHope is strength, endurance and motivation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe loss of hope can shatter and destroy,\u201d she said through tears. \u201cThis bill is the torch of hope.\u201d\n\nABC News' John Parkinson contributed to this report.", "description": "Advocates say the House needs to act quickly to pass funding for grants that help states eliminate rape kit backlogs before money runs out at the end of the month.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/rape-kit-01-gty-jc-190130_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
