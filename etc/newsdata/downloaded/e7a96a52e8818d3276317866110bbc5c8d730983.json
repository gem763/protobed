As with so much of Trump\u2019s output, there is enough ambiguity here that his opponents and defenders alike are claiming vindication.\n\n\u201cThe transcript and the Justice Department\u2019s acting in a rogue fashion in being complicit in the President\u2019s lawlessness confirm the need for an impeachment inquiry,\u201d Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile, Representative Matt Gaetz (R-FL) accused Pelosi of having been \u201ccatfished into a politically fatal impeachment proceeding based on rumors, based on faulty evidence and based on a bloodlust for the president.\u201d The transcript, Gaetz claimed, proved there had been \u201cno quid-pro-quo \u2026 for anything, much less military aid.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nStrictly speaking, Gaetz is correct. There is no explicit quid pro quo to be found anywhere in the transcript. Rather, it must be inferred from the sequence of topics discussed and from the conversation\u2019s larger context.\n\nAs David French explains, early in the call Trump complains that Ukraine has not returned the United States' good will. This framing establishes Trump\u2019s expectation of negotiated reciprocity. After Zelensky says his country will soon be ready to purchase more Javelin missiles\u2014a vital tool in Ukraine\u2019s defense against Russian belligerence\u2014Trump immediately describes the \u201cfavor\u201d he expects in return: cooperation with the Department of Justice\u2019s ongoing investigation into the origins of the Russia probe. Had Trump stopped there, the exchange would have been perfectly legitimate. But he then requests that Zelensky work with Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal attorney, to investigate Joe Biden for allegedly abusing his power to shut down an investigation into Burisma Holdings, which employed his son, Hunter.\n\nGiven that Trump ordered a hold on $391 million in military aid to Ukraine a week before the July 25th call, it is all but certain that a quid pro quo was intended. And, as alleged in the whistleblower complaint, senior administration officials were alarmed by the conversation. The Wall Street Journal reports that earlier this month Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) met with Zelensky and other officials in Ukraine who, according to Murphy, \u201cworried the aid that was being cut off to Ukraine by the president was a consequence for their unwillingness at the time to investigate the Bidens.\u201d (Zelensky has subsequently denied that he was pressured.)\n\nWhether Trump has actually undermined our national security or merely placed it at risk, he is hardly the first American president to manipulate foreign policy for the sake of influencing an election.\n\nThe most egregious example is former President Barack Obama\u2019s quid pro quo with Moscow during his 2012 campaign for re-election. On March 26th, at the Nuclear Security Summit in Seoul, Obama pledged to outgoing Russian president and Putin-proxy Dmitri Medvedev that if Moscow gave him \u201cspace\u201d (i.e., forestalled antagonizing its neighbors) he would have greater \u201cflexibility\u201d after the election regarding concessions on missile defense shields in Europe. Mitt Romney\u2019s campaign had emphasized the dangers posed by Russia\u2019s escalating bellicosity, and Obama\u2019s softness toward Russia (even after its invasion of Georgia) was an electoral liability.\n\nThis quid pro quo produced devastating consequences. It further signaled Obama\u2019s unwillingness to check Russian aggression, delayed the installation of missile-defense shields in Europe, and arguably encouraged Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea two years later.\n\nRepublicans naturally viewed Obama\u2019s \u201chot mic\u201d pledge as a \u201cbetrayal of our national security and [a] betrayal of the integrity of our elections,\u201d to co-opt Pelosi\u2019s phrasing when announcing an impeachment inquiry this week. Rep. Mike Turner (R-OH) decried the \u201csecret deal\u201d Obama had struck with the Russians, seeming to view it as verging on treason. Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA) compared it to the West\u2019s passivity after the Second World War, which allowed the USSR to seize Poland, East Germany, and a host of other nations.\n\nAfter pro-Russian separatists shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, the reliably intemperate Allen West (R-FL) went further: \"The blood on Vladimir Putin\u2019s hands was poured by Barack Obama, who is indirectly responsible, accountable and no different than Neville Chamberlain\u2019s weakness in the face of the 20th Century maniacal dictator Adolf Hitler.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The key difference was that Obama\u2019s pledge was of a piece with his existing Russophilic foreign policy, whereas Trump\u2019s behavior signals a willingness to deviate from his policy of robust support for Ukraine\u2014solely for the sake of electoral advantage. Morally speaking, there is a chasm separating the principles at work in each man\u2019s actions.\n\nLogical and moral consistency demands that any Republican who was troubled by Obama\u2019s behavior be just as troubled (if not more so) by Trump\u2019s. And any Republican who deemed Obama\u2019s offense worthy of impeachment must now apply the same standard to the leader of their party\u2014this even though, were the roles reversed, their opponents would almost certainly not do the same.\n\nThe only alternative is to embrace incoherence.", "description": "The declassified transcript of President Trump\u2019s conversation with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky\u00a0and the just-released whistleblower complaint have\u00a0proven to be Rorschach Tests.", "authors": ["Justin Lee"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/26/12/Donald-Trump-dark-.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
