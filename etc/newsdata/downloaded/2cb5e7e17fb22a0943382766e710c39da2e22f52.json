I wondered why on earth England hadn\u2019t taken the same measures to fight the injustices homeless people face \u2013 particularly at a time when the latest data from the charity Chain shows that there has been a rise in rough sleeping across London over the past year. This is an ongoing, even worsening issue.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

But it isn\u2019t just a bad night\u2019s sleep every once in a while that we\u2019re dealing with here. Think about it. If you have a late Saturday night and attempt to recover all day on Sunday, you end up slumped over your desk on Monday, exhausted and scrolling through takeaway options for dinner. Crucially, though, by the Tuesday \u2013 or Wednesday if you aren\u2019t one for fighting a hangover \u2013 you\u2019re refreshed, because you\u2019ve caught up on the sleep you lost.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

For them, every day is a battle with the tiredness that others are lucky enough to experience just once or twice a week. Unless, of course, you too, suffer with sleep-related issues such as insomnia. That, on top of the fact that constantly having to protect themselves and facing a whole host of other issues are all made worse by sustained sleep loss.\n\nJohn Groeger, a professor of psychology at Nottingham Trent University, who is also a sleep therapist, says that although sleep loss might \u201cseem like such a trivial concern, it is actually critical to physical and mental health, and the kind of chronic sleep loss that homeless people experience hugely affects their everyday lives.\u201d\n\nTalking to Taz, this was clearly what had happened with him. After explaining why his wife and daughters had left him to start a new life in Prague, he told me that sleep deprivation took a huge toll on his mind, which was common in other homeless people he knew as well. \u201cI end up talking to myself a lot because there\u2019s no one else there,\u201d he said. \u201cYour mind starts playing games on you when you\u2019re tired and it\u2019s so easy to become paranoid because there actually are people out to get you, so you start thinking everyone is.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that even the very limited temporary accommodation that is available to homeless people \u2013 like the kind that Scotland is now trying to ensure they don\u2019t get placed in for long periods \u2013 is not always a better option than the streets. Taz told me that hostels and B&Bs can be intimidating places, which provide a bed but very little else. He went on to ask me to imagine sleeping at night and what helped me to feel safe. I must have looked perplexed because before I could respond, he answered for me: \u201cA locked door and a bed where you can lie down knowing that no one is going to hurt you.\u201d He was right, of course. I, like many others, naively assumed temporary accommodation was providing shelter and so helping homeless people get a better night\u2019s sleep. \u201cThere are lots of people who try to steal your stuff in them, or take drugs, so although you\u2019re under a roof, you don\u2019t sleep very well. It\u2019s not just about being inside \u2013 that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll have a good night\u2019s sleep,\u201d he said.\n\nLinks between lack of sleep and poor mental health have long been made by the public health sector, yet for homeless people, it seems to be a grey area blamed on situation and consequence.\n\nGroeger said there needs to be time and money invested in not just housing homeless people, but helping them to have total autonomy in their lives \u2013 of which sleep is a huge contributing factor. Perhaps most importantly, what needs to happen now is that we ensure our MP\u2019s don\u2019t continue to quash all other issues \u2013 and let\u2019s be honest, there are a lot \u2013 with the monster that Brexit has become.\n\nHomelessness is an issue that continues to affect countries everywhere, particularly those who make up the statistics\u2026 those who are actually homeless. And if Scotland\u2019s government can make moves to remedy just some of the awful prejudice against homeless people, so can ours. It seems the first step, though, is for this problem to be recognised as just that: a problem.", "description": "\u201cWhen you sleep on the streets, anything you have in your pockets might be taken; people constantly try to mug you and beat you up \u2013 so, in the end, it becomes easier to stay awake.\u201d That\u2019s what Taz, a 61-year-old Nigerian homeless man who has lived in and around Shoreditch, East London, for over 40 years, told me when I took to the streets a couple of months ago to ask", "authors": ["Sam Hancock"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/01/31/17/homeless-waterloo-december-0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
