It was good to see my little girl come into the world.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t named her yet but once I get back we\u2019ll have a chat about that. My wife has some interesting names on the list, so hopefully I can persuade her otherwise.\n\n\u201cIt would have been nice to get to that milestone today having worked so hard but England are in a good position. Hopefully I have impressed the selectors.\n\n\u201cWhenever you open the batting there is expectation to score runs and do well. It\u2019s been frustrating to get starts and not cash in. This Australian attack make you work hard for every run.\u201d\n\nJoe Denly misses out on century but steers England to dominant position Read more\n\nIt was a maddening day for Australia, who will resume in the morning with two wickets still to claim and the lead already up to 382 runs. Their hopes of securing a first outright Ashes series win on English soil since 2001 are fading.\n\nThere were errors along the way, too, both in the catching department and the failure to review lbw shouts against Denly on 54 and Buttler on 19. Both were shown to be out, continuing a poor series for Tim Paine when using the review system. The Australia captain joked: \u201cI\u2019m going to do some umpiring school when I get home, I\u2019ll enrol in a level-three umpires course and see if I can get them right. We\u2019re having a mare.\n\n\u201cIt happens. It\u2019s fast, it\u2019s a tough job. As I\u2019ve said throughout the whole Test series I\u2019ve got a new respect for umpiring, particularly in Test cricket because it\u2019s a bloody hard job. For years players whinged about umpiring and now we\u2019ve got it in our hands a little bit and we\u2019re finding that it\u2019s hard.\u201d", "description": "Joe Denly hopes he has booked a place on England\u2019s winter tours after a rollercoaster match during which he has witnessed the birth of his second child and a career-best Test score", "authors": ["Ali Martin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4bdd29775c23c784372382850c001151f6e431f9/0_143_5342_3205/master/5342.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1d369bd06d660e5bd56a475545efdff2", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
