I explain that I\u2019m a tough grader and that the class average will be around a B-minus. \u201cI\u2019ll give you an A,\u201d I say. \u201cAll you have to do is designate someone to get an F.\u201d\n\nThe other students laugh nervously while Forrest considers the deal.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nI\u2019ve asked this question at the beginning of every semester for over 20 years, mostly to liberal northeasterners at Harvard and the City University of New York. It\u2019s a good starting point because it tends to show commonality. The beginning of ethical thinking is to accept that other people\u2019s interests matter. In all my years of teaching, I\u2019ve never had anyone take me up on my offer.\n\nBut I\u2019ve come here seeking difference, not similarity. The 2016 election exposed a national rift so deep that it feels as if even reasonable conversation is impossible. I\u2019m a liberal New Yorker, but I know that plenty of people on both sides of the political spectrum worry that this divide poses an existential threat to the American democratic project. On the most controversial issues\u2014race and immigration, to name just two\u2014we\u2019ve lost the capacity for compromise because we presume the most sinister motives about our opponents. I\u2019ve arrived here in the fall of 2018, hoping to find a wider range of views\u2014not to change anyone\u2019s opinions but rather to see whether there remain principles and a shared language of ethics that bind us together.\n\nSo I\u2019m as curious as everyone else in the class about how Forrest is going to answer.\n\nThe author, Evan Mandery, on campus at Appalachian State University. | Raymond McCrea Jones for Politico Magazine\n\nLean and wearing a red t-shirt, Forrest massages his wire-rimmed glasses as he thinks. \u201cI\u2019d rather get the grade on my own merit,\u201d he says at last. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to have anyone mad at me because I gave them an F.\u201d\n\nThe offer\u2019s losing streak intact, I extend it to every student in the class. \u201cRaise your hand,\u201d I say, \u201cand you\u2019ll get an A. All you have to do is point to someone who\u2019ll get an F.\u201d No hands go up. With a young woman named Sienna Lafon, I sweeten the offer: I\u2019ll give everyone in the class an A, including her. She simply has to pick one student to get an F.\n\nSienna says she won\u2019t do it.\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d I ask.\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s not fair,\u201d she replies.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I ask. If someone accepts the deal, the class as a whole will be better off. In the language we\u2019ll develop during the semester, it\u2019s a utilitarian no-brainer: The class GPA will rise from 2.7 to near 4.0. Still, no one bites.\n\nA student named Jackson says finally, \u201cI think we should just earn what we get.\u201d\n\nThese answers, with the exception of some southern accents, sound almost identical to ones that I hear from my typical class John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Of course, we\u2019re still in the realm of hypotheticals. It\u2019ll be several weeks until we get to late-term abortions, gun bans and the death penalty. Donald Trump\u2019s name has yet to be spoken. The conversations will no doubt become more fraught as things get more real.\n\n\n\n***\n\nOne of the memorable sights of Appalachian State\u2019s campus is this statue of Daniel Boone with his hunting dogs. The school is located in Boone, North Carolina, a city named after the American pioneer and explorer. | Raymond McCrea Jones for Politico Magazine\n\nFinding a place to teach ethics in the South was more difficult than I had imagined. My initial idea was to go to the most remote school that would have me, but most don\u2019t even offer an ethics course. The philosophy department of a community college in rural Tennessee was interested until the administration balked at my qualifications. They\u2019d have accepted a degree in religion, but not one in law. When I stumbled upon Appalachian State, the school immediately seemed like a good fit\u2014open to me and the kind of conversation I wanted to foster.\n\n\u201cApp,\u201d as the students call it, was founded in 1903 by a Confederate veteran and his brother in Boone\u2014a remote community in the Blue Ridge Mountain highlands that had been pillaged by Union soldiers, a wound from which its economy never fully recovered. Their ambition was to train public school teachers in the so-called \u201clost provinces.\u201d Today, the college is part of the University of North Carolina system with 17,000 students, approximately 86 percent of whom are from the state.\n\nOn the surface, App possesses all the hallmarks of the American academy\u2014a grassy quad framed by a student union, dining hall and library. Kiosks beckon students to concerts and club meetings. But underground run a pair of pedestrian tunnels, connecting the east and west campuses, that have been designated as free speech havens. These dank passageways are filled with graffiti\u2014most of the messages are positive, but the students tell me that a swastika was painted there last October and then quickly painted over by other students. When I visit, the space feels sinister, but also strangely healthy\u2014a messy marketplace of ideas that I like to think portends open-mindedness.\n\nBoone feels like any other college town. Ambling down the main drag\u2014King Street\u2014wafting incense lures me into the Dancing Moon Earthway Bookstore, where I peruse an impressive collection of paranormal titles and herbal teas. The store hosts Thoughtful Thursdays and a poetry circle. The centerpiece of the \u201cBoone Mall\u201d is Anna Banana\u2019s consignment shop and the place to eat is the F.A.R.M Cafe (Feed All Regardless of Means), a locally-sourced community kitchen where customers pay what they can.\n\nBut Boone is a little blue island in a sea of red. You\u2019d have to drive about 30 miles to find another polling district that voted for Hillary Clinton, and there are only a total of five within a 75-miles radius. The district\u2019s eight-term incumbent Congresswoman, Virginia Foxx, opposes abortion, co-sponsored legislation to end birthright citizenship and said the nation had more to fear from Obamacare than from any terrorist.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2016 election, I read widely\u2014and somewhat unsatisfyingly\u2014to try and understand the root causes of polarization. J.D. Vance\u2019s Hillbilly Elegy moved me, and it\u2019s impossible to read George Packer\u2019s The Unwinding, which takes place largely in North Carolina after the Great Recession, without being unsettled by the coming apart of bedrock American institutions. But nothing I read fully explains the mistrust\u2014daresay hatred\u2014that has evolved between liberals and conservatives.\n\nComing in, I assumed some of my students would reflect the conservatism of the surrounding region and others the liberalism generally prevalent among college students. What I didn\u2019t know is whether my students\u2014and young people generally\u2014are predestined to sort themselves into those mutually loathing tribes, or if a shared conversation about foundational ethical beliefs could alter their views of people with whom they disagree.\n\n\n\n***\n\nIn between classes, Appalachian State students walk through a pedestrian tunnel that runs beneath a street. | Raymond McCrea Jones for Politico Magazine\n\nMy class is modeled on one created by Michael Sandel, a charismatic, globetrotting political philosopher who has taught \u201cJustice\u201d to more than 15,000 Harvard undergraduates. It\u2019s the perfect vehicle for learning about people\u2019s political values. The syllabus pairs readings in classic philosophy\u2014John Stuart Mill, Immanuel Kant, Aristotle, John Rawls\u2014with modern policy dilemmas including abortion, affirmative action and hate speech.\n\nBut inevitably, all journeys of ethical discovery begin with the trolley problem.\n\n\u201cA trolley is barreling down the tracks to which five people have been tied,\u201d I explain during our second meeting. \u201cYou can flip a switch and divert the trolley, but you\u2019d kill someone else who\u2019s been tied to the sidetrack.\u201d\n\nI ask a young woman named Kierstin Davis what she would do. (It\u2019s her real name\u2014all of the students quoted here consented to participate in this article.) \u201cI probably would flip the switch because I know less people would be killed,\u201d she says. Almost all of her fellow students concur, albeit reluctantly. The notable exception is Jackson.\n\n\u201cYou kill the one person,\u201d he says without hesitation.\n\nJackson is wearing jeans, cowboy boots and a Carhartt shirt. His baseball cap, which he got on a trip to Yellowstone, displays the outline of a bison and mountains. In the discussion of grades, Jackson was the one who said that everyone deserved equal opportunity. I remind him of this, but he\u2019s ready with a distinction: \u201cIn this situation you don\u2019t have a choice\u2014somebody has to die, so it goes beyond equal opportunity and becomes what this outcome is going to be.\u201d It\u2019s clear that Jackson will be a force. The distinction he\u2019s drawing is smart\u2014no one had to get an F in my first example, but, more importantly, it\u2019s clear that he likes this kind of intellectual jousting.\n\nI return to Kierstin and change the facts. It\u2019s her mom who\u2019s tied to the tracks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to save my mom obviously,\u201d Kierstin replies, \u201cbut I would feel bad.\u201d\n\nUtilitarianism can take you to dark places. It certainly has no room to accommodate youthful sentimentality.\n\nNow, I say, the trolley is loaded with nuclear weapons. Five million people will die in a fiery inferno, including innocent babies, unless Kierstin throws the switch. \u201cI probably would save my mom to be honest,\u201d she says.\n\nMost of the students nod their heads in agreement, voting for mothers over cities.\n\nBut as is becoming increasingly apparent, the cool-headed libertarian in my classroom who\u2019s willing to sacrifice his mother for the greater good doesn\u2019t fit neatly into any of these circles.\n\nBut Jackson once again stands out. He says he\u2019d kill his mom or even a baby if it meant saving more lives. \u201cI mean, someone has to die either way and I\u2019m fine putting my life\u2014even if I had to spend the rest of my life in prison or whatever it is\u2014to save the five versus the one.\u201d\n\nI haven\u2019t known Jackson for long, but I believe that he would sacrifice himself for the greater good, and I can see that his classmates believe it too. Even if they don\u2019t share his willingness to throw the switch on a family member, they see him as principled, not cruel. It\u2019s a type of selflessness and consistency that seems lacking in contemporary discourse, in which people are too willing to prioritize what\u2019s politically expedient over fundamental values. It\u2019s what feels wrong, for example, about liberal intolerance of dissenting speech, especially on campus, or the rush to punish alleged sexual predators without due process. And it\u2019s what feels equally wrong about conservatives who claim to revere life, and yet can display such brazen cruelty to immigrants and prisoners.\n\nMy students don\u2019t come to class with signs around their necks announcing their political leanings. None of them were even old enough to vote in the 2016 election. But the near unanimity with which they responded to the trolley question is notable. Over the years, I\u2019ve noticed that most people analyze these sort of dilemmas in more or less the same way.\n\nIndeed, Jesse Graham, a professor at the University of Utah\u2019s business school, says that for all their ideological differences, liberals and conservatives are pretty much identical in how they view trolley-like dilemmas. Graham has conducted a dozen studies on \u201ctrolleyology,\u201d which occupies its own niche in social psychology research. \u201cLiberals are a little bit more likely than conservatives to say, \u2018OK, yes you can push the guy off the bridge to save the five people,\u2019\u201d Graham says, emphasizing a little. \u201cIt\u2019s questionable whether you\u2019d even say there\u2019s a difference there,\u201d he continues. \u201cOverall liberals and conservatives are really similar.\u201d\n\nLibertarians, however, are a different story. We don\u2019t talk much about them\u2014not members of the political party with that name, but rather people who believe in limited government. There are a lot of the latter (estimates range between 7 percent and 22 percent), and they merit greater discussion. Graham and his collaborators, including New York University\u2019s Jonathan Haidt, have collected reams of data on people\u2019s values at yourmorals.org. One instrument, called the Moral Foundations Questionnaire, measures the extent to which a person is influenced by five moral foundations: harm-care, fairness-reciprocity, ingroup loyalty, authority-respect and purity-sanctity. In a study of 12,000 libertarians, Graham found that libertarian responses to the MFQ differ more from either liberals or conservatives than liberals and conservatives\u2019 answers differ from each other.\n\nGraham explains that the libertarian cognitive style is cerebral rather than emotional. \u201cLibertarians are far and away the most likely to say, \u2018Yeah, push the guy off.\u2019 They just see it as a math problem,\u201d he tells me. \u201cThey have no squeamishness about having to kill the person.\u201d It\u2019s coldly calculating, but also, arguably, rigorously ethical. As Graham tells me this, I can\u2019t help but think that efforts to unpack what separates red states from blue states haven\u2019t been careful to differentiate between conservatives and libertarians. Venn diagrams of voters generally categorize voters as Republicans and Democrats or liberals and conservatives. But as is becoming increasingly apparent, the cool-headed libertarian in my classroom who\u2019s willing to sacrifice his mother for the greater good doesn\u2019t fit neatly into any of these circles.\n\nIt occurs to me that if America is going to come together, it\u2019s going to have to reckon with Jackson Cooter.\n\n\n\n***\n\nJackson Cooter. | Raymond McCrea Jones for Politico Magazine\n\nJackson comes from Greenville, South Carolina. With approximately 70,000 residents, it\u2019s the sixth largest city in the state. Greenville\u2019s economy used to be driven by textile manufacturing. Today tax incentives have made it an attractive base for foreign corporations\u2014Michelin has its North American headquarters there, and the population is largely professional. Outside of class, Jackson tells me that both of his parents graduated from college\u2014his mom, Rachel, from Chico State in California and his dad, Mark, from Wake Forest. Mark\u2019s a second-generation CPA, who Jackson describes as \u201ca numbers guy.\u201d Both his parents voted for Trump, and Jackson says he would have too had he been old enough to vote.\n\nFor years, Jackson says he fit the mold of a good Southern boy\u2014he played football, wore Southern Tide clothing, and went deer and duck hunting with his father. On Sundays, his family attended services at the local Presbyterian church. But in high school, things began to shift. Jackson credits the transformation to a tutor, to whom he declared that he \u201cwas tired of having mediocre grades.\u201d The instructor encouraged Jackson to read more. He did\u2014ploughing through Bear Grylls\u2019 autobiography Mud, Sweat, and Tears; Chris Kyle\u2019s American Sniper; and Patrick Deneen\u2019s Conserving America?, which included essays from John Locke and made Jackson \u201cmore aware of the idea of liberty, man\u2019s natural relationship with power, and how government is hardly ever the answer.\u201d Over time, he drifted away from organized religion.\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, when we arrive, five weeks into the semester, at our discussion on the ethics of gun control, Jackson\u2019s is the dominant voice. To prepare, we\u2019ve read Milton and Rose Friedman\u2019s capitalist manifesto, Free to Choose; an ethnography of gun owners; and a brief history of the NRA. The central question is how broadly the right of gun ownership should be construed.\n\nJackson begins with a historical argument. \u201cOur military fought the British military,\u201d he says, \u201cbut the real reason we seceded, at least according to the historical record, is the militia of private citizens that took up arms.\u201d His point is that the Second Amendment exists principally to check government power. Many of the students support the sentiment.\n\n\u201cOne of the principles of good government is providing a way in which citizens can topple it when they don\u2019t have faith in its ability to govern justly,\u201d says Cole Cadman. He\u2019s the only Jewish person in the class other than me and is generally a social liberal. It\u2019s clear that the gun issue resonates in a way that transcends political labels.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think is a condition under which rebellion against the federal government is required?\u201d I ask. \u201cSuppose Trump nationalized The New York Times?\u201d\n\nA couple of students demur, saying they still wouldn\u2019t revolt. But Jackson nods his head vigorously. \u201cThe second they undemocratically go against the Constitution,\u201d he says, \u201cis when I\u2019m going to revolt.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan the militia have nuclear weapons?\u201d I ask.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve actually thought about this a lot,\u201d Jackson replies. In the past, \u201cCannons were mostly privately owned, and people had far more than muskets to begin with. I think that the intention would have been that as the military develops\u2014let\u2019s say the repeating rifle, then the citizen has that option.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what\u2019s the limit?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we had nukes, it would be chaos,\u201d Jackson answers. \u201cBut you have to be able to defend against the government.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour bottom line of justice is very similar to mine,\u201d I tell Jackson, \u201cbut how do I know that everyone\u2019s like you? How do I know that group number two won\u2019t say, \u2018The government\u2019s allowing abortions,\u2019 or group number three says, \u2018They\u2019re allowing black people to vote, so we should nuke Congress?\u2019 Whose conception of government overreach should control?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a hard question,\u201d Jackson confesses. He thinks for a long time before adding, \u201cThey believe they\u2019re doing right, and I\u2019m not God. I don\u2019t get to say what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong. When I say I\u2019m going to revolt, I\u2019m obviously going to think that I\u2019m right.\u201d Recognizing that libertarianism taken to the extreme is anarchy, Jackson asks, \u201cCan I keep thinking about this?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I answer.\n\nMandery speaks with students on campus. Top: With Jackson Cooter. Bottom: With students from his most recent class. | Raymond McCrea Jones for Politico Magazine\n\nStrikingly, Jackson\u2019s defense of gun ownership never once mentions a love of guns. He\u2019s a \u201clittle-d\u201d democrat who wants a super-process in place in case democracy, as his classmate Cole puts it, \u201cfails to work or provide any meaningful benefits.\u201d Resolving the ambiguity of for whom it\u2019s supposed to work and who\u2019s supposed to decide when change within the system is futile might be impossible, but it\u2019s important to recognize the argument for what it is. It\u2019s not about guns for the sake of guns, it\u2019s about protecting civil liberties, and it\u2019s deeply ethical.\n\nAnd this is where our somewhat fanciful classroom discussion reveals real-world implications. Imagine a gun control debate that avoided an argument over the value and necessity of guns, but instead was framed around how to protect civil liberties and limit gun violence without excessive governmental involvement. Imagine if care were taken to frame the discussion not as outsiders trying to impose their will on people whose culture they did not understand, but rather as one among people with a shared interest in protecting the safety of their children. My suspicion is a conversation like that would reveal useful common ground. It\u2019s an epiphany.\n\nAnd it leads quickly to epiphany number two, which seems dramatically more important. If Americans are serious about reducing polarization, they\u2019re going to have to start doing some careful listening, because what Jackson is saying has very little to do with what we say he\u2019s saying.\n\nIf one looks\u2014and listens\u2014carefully, a consensus reveals itself across a wide diversity of fields on the importance and untapped power of listening. The names and nuances of these approaches to careful listening differ, but they share two basic qualities.\n\nThe first is to listen with an open mind. NYU psychologist Carol Gilligan, who began the Radical Listening Project in 2017, says the essential step is \u201creplacing judgment with curiosity,\u201d or, as put by my student Gaby Romero, who has been trained in the diplomat Hal Saunders\u2019 Sustained Dialogue protocol, \u201cto acknowledge that everyone is there out of a genuine desire to learn and understand.\u201d Michigan State University professor Donna Kaplowitz, who practices an approach known as Intergroup Dialogue, simply calls it \u201cgenerous listening.\u201d\n\nThe second quality is that all these approaches, in one way or another, ask the listener to inhabit another person. One element of Gilligan\u2019s Listening Guide, which she developed and practiced in researching her seminal gender study, In a Different Voice, is to separate each phrase containing \u201cI\u201d from a narrative and list it in order of its appearance, thereby composing what Gilligan calls an \u201cI poem.\u201d Professor Sandel at Harvard does something similar when he teaches. After a student speaks in \u201cJustice,\u201d Sandel makes eye contact with the student, gestures in his or her direction, often with an open palm, and restates the argument in its most reasonable form. Years later, this remains my most lasting impression of the class.\n\nThe aim \u201cis to create a space in which I can admit\u2014let in\u2014another person\u2019s voice,\u201d Gilligan says. It\u2019s a way of stimulating empathy. \u201cYou never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view\u2014until you climb into his skin and walk around in it,\u201d Atticus Finch tells Scout in To Kill a Mockingbird. An emerging body of research shows that Finch\u2014or Harper Lee\u2014was right.\n\nCurious things start to happen to people when they listen generously. At the most superficial level, one hears things that he or she might not like. But one also hears the sincerity of people\u2019s convictions, the authenticity of their experiences, and the nuance of their narratives. Being open is transformative because, almost inevitably, one finds that the stories they\u2019ve been told about what people believe oversimplify reality.\n\nNowhere is this truer than in the context of the subject of Week 10 on our syllabus: abortion.\n\n\n\n***\n\nGaby Romero, an Appalachian State student, sits in her dorm room with a copy of Michael Sandel\u2019s book, \u201cJustice.\u201d | Raymond McCrea Jones for Politico Magazine\n\nGaby Romero and Emma Strange could hardly have more different backgrounds.\n\nWhen she was 4 months old, Gaby\u2019s parents moved their family from Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, to the U.S., ultimately settling in Apex, North Carolina, a railroad town that used to farm tobacco where her mom, Gladys, and dad, Carlos, found work, respectively, as a Spanish teacher and an electrical engineer. Carlos, a graduate of the Colombian Naval Academy, embraced the American dream and identified himself as a Reagan Republican. Emma is white, attended a magnet high school outside Greensboro, North Carolina, and comes from a family of Democrats. \u201cMy mom cried with joy when Obama was elected,\u201d Emma told me.\n\nGaby and Emma would seem to have little in common ideologically, and yet their positions on abortion are nearly the same. When I survey the class, each embraces a perspective that might be called \u201cpro-choice, anti-abortion.\u201d Gaby says, \u201cI think a lot of people who are pro-life are really anti-abortion. The issue is framed in black and white, but it\u2019s not.\u201d Though she\u2019s among the most liberal students in the course, Emma sounds a similar note. \u201cI try whenever I think about these things to put myself in the shoes of everyone involved,\u201d she says. \u201cOut of empathy for the woman, I want to make sure she feels safe and helped, but I can put myself in the shoes of someone who thinks you\u2019re murdering a baby. Late-term abortions are hard.\u201d\n\nIf you teach ethics for long enough, you develop a physician\u2019s sensitivity to areas that can be probed for tenderness. For people who describe themselves as pro-choice, the pressure point is late-term abortions. To frame our conversation, the students have read Princeton philosophy professor Peter Singer\u2019s Practical Ethics. Singer, a utilitarian, argues that it\u2019s difficult or impossible to distinguish late-term abortions from infanticide. In his view, if one accepts a justification for aborting a fetus after it has the capacity to experience pain\u2014such as low potential quality of life or hardship to the mother\u2014then it\u2019s likely also a justification for killing an infant.\n\nIf you teach ethics for long enough, you develop a physician's sensitivity to areas that can be probed for tenderness.\n\nSinger is being deliberately provocative, but the logic is compelling and inevitably forces students to reconsider the justifications they offer for late-term abortions. Most of the class rejects genetic disorders, such as Down Syndrome, and birth defects, such as spina bifida, as legitimate bases for infanticide. This makes the students think twice about them as justifications for abortion.\n\nSienna says, \u201cI would feel terrible if I aborted a child because of that scenario and a year later there was a treatment.\u201d Like Emma, she\u2019s from Greensboro. Her mother, a chief financial officer at a car company, and her father, a corrections officer, both drifted away from the Baptist church, and Sienna describes herself as agnostic and pro-choice, but she sounds a note in the pro-life register. \u201cIf it\u2019s something that\u2019s livable,\u201d she says, \u201cI think it makes sense to let the individual live.\u201d Cole agrees, saying, \u201cThey definitely don\u2019t deserve to be aborted.\u201d\n\nThe most outspokenly pro-choice student in the class is Holly Gallagher, a junior from Chapel Hill. Her extremely cogent defense of choice is premised on the unequal impact of pregnancy on women\u2014\u201cthe principle of just one person being disadvantaged from having a baby in them matters\u201d\u2014and a widely held view on the status of fetuses. \u201cI just don\u2019t view a baby in the womb as an actual person,\u201d she says. \u201cI understand that people do, and they have every right to, but I don\u2019t weigh it the same as an actual life.\u201d\n\nBut Holly hesitates when I remind of her of newborns\u2019 helplessness and whether her position opens the door to justifying infanticide under extreme circumstances.\n\n\u201cCan I think about it?\u201d she asks with a smile.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I say, \u201cthe whole point is to think about these things for the rest of your life.\u201d\n\nConversely, the sensitive pressure point for pro-lifers is the vilification of women who have early abortions.\n\n\u201cI think that life starts at conception,\u201d Jackson says. He\u2019s wearing a black t-shirt today, with the slogan \u201cFREEDOM WAS NOT FREE,\u201d and he\u2019s articulating the clearest, strongest pro-life position in the class. \u201cI\u2019ll make an exception for rape,\u201d he says, but not for anything else.\n\nEven Jackson, though, sees a significant privacy interest for pregnant women when the fetus has not yet developed the capacity to experience pain. \u201cI get conflicted on early-term abortions,\u201d he concedes.\n\n\u201cI do understand the quality of life argument, and the mother and father\u2019s ability to raise a child from an economic standpoint.\u201d Jackson\u2019s focus is on paternal responsibility\u2014\u201cif I had a child, my father would slit my throat if I ever jokingly said that I was going to leave that child\u201d\u2014and reducing abortions\u2014\u201cI\u2019m interested in seeing free birth control. There\u2019s not enough emphasis on that.\u201d He has no interest in punishing women.\n\nAlmost no one does.\n\n\n\nStudent Gaby Romero is active in social justice causes, as reflected in the pins affixed to her backpack. | Raymond McCrea Jones for Politico Magazine\n\nIn the most recent available poll, only 10 percent of Americans thought a woman who had an abortion should be punished. In 20 years of teaching, I\u2019ve never met anyone who supported criminalizing abortion.\n\nBut I\u2019ve also met almost no one who didn\u2019t think abortion presents a significant ethical quandary. When I ask Professor Sandel how he\u2019s been changed by the experience of teaching ethics, abortion is what comes to his mind. \u201cI came to think that it\u2019s legitimate for those who have strong religious convictions, for example about the moral status of the developing fetus\u2014it\u2019s legitimate for those views to be introduced into public debate,\u201d he tells me. \u201cThey should be debated, they need to be defended, they should be open to criticism, but they are appropriate in public debate.\u201d I\u2019m pro-choice, as Sandel is, but I\u2019ve come to believe the same thing. I\u2019ve also come to believe that if liberals started from the premise that the pro-life position is a legitimate argument that comes from love not hate, the tenor of the conversation about choice would be quite different.\n\nFor if one were inclined to search for consensus rather than difference\u2014to listen with curiosity rather than judgment\u2014it\u2019s possible to see far broader agreement on abortion in America than is commonly allowed. \u201cWhen you think of these debates, you\u2019re thinking that all Republicans are pro-life and all Democrats are pro-choice, but even among Republicans, over a third are saying that abortion should be legal in all or most cases,\u201d Graham tells me. \u201cWhen you look at abortion attitudes by trimester there\u2019s actually a great deal of agreement on first trimester and third trimester. Really the whole debate is about the second trimester.\u201d\n\nYet, politicians rarely seek to build consensus around abortion. Then-Senator Hillary Clinton tried in a remarkable 2005 speech to the New York State Family Planning Providers, in which she sought to find \u201ccommon ground\u201d by preventing unwanted pregnancies and reducing abortions. \u201cI believe we can all recognize that abortion in many ways represents a sad, even tragic choice to many, many women,\u201d Clinton said at the time. But closed primaries force candidates to polar extremes, and as a presidential candidate, Clinton sounded quite different. In response to a question from Chris Wallace about late-term abortion at the third presidential debate in 2016, she took a hard line and said, \u201cI do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions.\u201d\n\nHave Democrats been careful to say that they\u2019re pro-choice but anti-abortion? At the same time, have Republicans been careful to acknowledge that women are alive and that if one is pro-life, he or she must therefore also be pro-woman?\n\nI offer another deal to the students, this one less theoretical than any runaway trolley scenario: \u201cNo more abortions after a fetus can experience pain. In exchange, prenatal care, neonatal care, health care for the mother, child support, parental leave, a humane adoption system, and the whole suite of policy proposals that would begin to offset the discriminatory impact pregnancy has on women\u2014civil rights laws to prevent discrimination on the basis of pregnancy or marital status, wage parity, and compensatory payments for the burden of bearing children.\n\n\u201cObviously a fiction, but what would you say?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d take it,\u201d Emma replies, \u201cif you\u2019d also throw in free birth control.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nEvan Mandery on campus. | Raymond McCrea Jones for Politico Magazine\n\nListen: Change happens, but not to opinions.\n\nChances are that nothing you\u2019ve read here has changed your position on abortion or guns. If anything, you\u2019re probably more convinced than ever that your position is correct.\n\nThe process is called biased assimilation. It\u2019s the well-documented tendency of people to interpret information in a manner that confirms their pre-existing beliefs. The effect is so strong that when people are presented with information that contradicts a belief they hold, they\u2019ll often become more rather than less certain of their conviction. During my career, only one student has ever reported to me a significant, lasting change in their attitudes.\n\nBut teachers aren\u2019t in the classroom to proselytize and changing minds isn\u2019t the point of an experience like this course. When I talk to the students after the semester, they almost all sound a similar theme. Caleb Wright, who\u2019s from Chapel Hill says, \u201cThe value is that you can staunchly disagree with someone, but also humanize the person.\u201d Adds Gaby, \u201cIt was more to learn about each other than to change people\u2019s minds.\u201d\n\nThe point, in other words, is to combat \u201cothering.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t change their minds, they just change their opinion about the other side,\u201d says Ravi Iyer, a social psychologist who, with Jonathan Haidt and Matt Motyl, founded Civil Politics, a nonprofit aimed at bridging moral divisions. \u201cThe evidence is imperfect,\u201d Iyer says, \u201cbut all of the imperfect evidence is telling a similar story.\u201d\n\nThat story is known as the contact hypothesis\u2014a well-supported theory in social psychology that contact between members of different groups is likely to reduce mutual prejudice. After the course ends, Gaby tells me that her high school classmates and neighbors would say terrible things about immigrants\u2014\u201cIf you\u2019re here \u2018illegally,\u2019 you should die,\u201d but would moderate their positions when they spoke directly to her or her father. \u201cPeople are so disconnected from their words,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you challenge them, at least a little fear breaks down.\u201d\n\nThat goes both ways.\n\nLiberals are as guilty as conservatives of \u201cothering\u201c those with whom they disagree. Jackson says that he chose Appalachian State because it was more liberal than other Southern colleges. \u201cWho wants to be around people they agree with?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow do we not hash out ideas? I think debate is the best thing ever.\u201d He thought that left-leaning students would see it similarly, but things didn\u2019t work out as he expected. \u201cThe social experience was worse than I thought,\u201d Jackson said.\n\nInstead of concerning ourselves with ensuring safe spaces for students, we need to create more spaces in which constructive conflict can occur. Trust me, no one will get hurt.\n\nDuring a discussion of gun policy in a course called \u201cConservativism,\u201d Jackson told his classmates that school shootings were extreme events, and that it was \u201cpointless to make policy to combat this.\u201d At this point, \u201ca woman started bawling and saying she couldn\u2019t believe I was OK with the murder of children,\u201d Jackson recalled. \u201cEverything doesn\u2019t need to be personal,\u201d he added. \u201cBut it\u2019s much easier to fight a villain than a person who\u2019s reasonable.\u201d\n\nMost of the students I spoke with agreed that conservatives are often vilified in campus dialogues. \u201cI see more push back from other progressives, that limits things in a way.\u201d Gaby said, echoing a central theme of Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt\u2019s The Coddling of the American Mind. The principles of the university and civil libertarian democracy require robust protection of free speech. But conflict and dissent should be embraced, not merely tolerated. \u201cThe notion that a university should protect all of its students from ideas that some of them find offensive is a repudiation of the legacy of Socrates,\u201d write Lukianoff and Haidt. More importantly, the impulse to insulate violates the very mechanism by which conflict is reduced.\n\nWe teach people that it\u2019s impolite to discuss religion and politics in public. It\u2019s wrong. We need to teach people how to discuss religion and politics. The first step is simple. \u201cGet them to commit to be together,\u201d says Rhonda Fitzgerald, managing director of the Sustained Dialogue Campus Network, \u201cand tell them their job is to listen to each other. That\u2019s what success is in this space.\u201d\n\nHow to Fix Politics We asked big thinkers for their most daring solutions\n\nto the country's political problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter whether that space is a lecture hall, living room or negotiating table. Studies show that college graduates are more accepting of social differences, but the tolerance isn\u2019t learned in a specific course, it\u2019s a byproduct of encountering diversity. When Lukianoff and Haidt and Mayor Pete Buttigeg, among others, tout national service, their point is to force people outside of their comfort zone.\n\nInstead of concerning ourselves with ensuring safe spaces for students, we need to create more spaces in which constructive conflict can occur. Trust me, no one will get hurt. Even in a classroom with divergent points of view on hot-button political issues, no one at App said anything racist or bullying. In my entire career, I\u2019ve never seen a classroom conversation degenerate into the kind of ad hominem attacks that are rampant on social media and cable news.\n\nProfessors Sandel, Gilligan, and Graham said they\u2019d never seen it either. We can teach people to distinguish unreasonable arguments from reasonable arguments with which they disagree and, where differences are unresolvable, how to disagree reasonably. And yet we don\u2019t do it.\n\n\u201cCollege admissions don\u2019t ask: How well do you listen?\u201d says Fitzgerald. Moreover, few schools at any level require experiences that would cultivate dialoguing skills. As Jackson put it, \u201cOne problem with the education system is there isn\u2019t room to talk about politics.\u201d Or, more to the point, to learn how to talk about politics. Kaplowitz told me that she\u2019d run successful listening workshops with children as young as third graders.\n\nI left my experience at App with a richer understanding of Southern conservatives and libertarians, but more significantly with great optimism, even exuberance, about the untapped potential of experiences that teach people how to talk productively about their differences. Even after a career spent moderating conversations on controversial issues, I learned how to listen better and was changed by the stories I heard.\n\nImagine if, instead of requiring a swim test for college students or gym for middle-schoolers, we required students to sit in a room with a diverse group of people and listen to the stories of their life. \u201cIf I wanted to prepare children to live as citizens in a democratic society,\u201d Gilligan says, \u201cnothing would be more valuable than to teach them to listen.\u201d", "description": "There\u2019s a language for talking about hot-button issues.
