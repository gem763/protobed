One day I sat on the bus and thought 'why have I never knitted a jumper that looks like a bus seat?'.\n\n\"I jumped off the bus at the next stop and went to a wool shop and knitted that jumper.\"\n\nImage copyright Joseph Ford Image caption A mouse uses its jumper to hide from a cat in plain sight\n\nJoseph added: \"We had been working together on another project and Nina mentioned this jumper to me and I thought it was great.\n\n\"We found a model and Brighton Bus Company gave us a bus for the afternoon and shot a picture.\n\n\"I said to Nina would she knit another one if I came up with a good idea?\"\n\nImage copyright Hoxton Mini Press Image caption Nina and Joseph's book Invisible Jumpers has now been published\n\nSome of Joseph's ideas were almost impossible to replicate in knit-form but other ideas did come to fruition including a camouflage jumper for a dog.\n\nYou may also like:\n\nImage copyright Joseph Ford Image caption Nina Dodd knitted a jumper for a banana to be able to blend into a watermelon\n\nNina said: \"It was always a challenge.\n\n\"The problem with knitting is that it is very complicated stuff. If it is a regular pattern like the bus with straight lines then it is easy-peasy.\n\n\"With the other stuff you are knitting three stitches and changing colours.\"\n\nFollow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram.
