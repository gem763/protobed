Several dozen Hong Kongers turned up at a preseason basketball game in New York on Friday to show their support for Morey, but that was before James entered the scuffle:\n\n(The \u201cFree Winnie the Pooh\u201d sign in the video is a reference to China\u2019s ban on the lovable bear because critics of Chinese President Xi Jinping enjoy comparing his rotund physique to that of Pooh.)", "description": "Hong Kong protesters play basketball in NBA jerseys to tweak star player LeBron James for refusing to stand up for them.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/LeBron-James-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
