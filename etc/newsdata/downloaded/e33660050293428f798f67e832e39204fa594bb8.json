In total, sales dropped \u00a356.8million in the last year to July\n\nFigures from analysts Kantar show total sales fell 4.7 per cent to \u00a31.2billion, while own-label bacon fared particularly badly with sales down 6 per cent.\n\nThe slump was partly driven by health reports warning processed meat carries a cancer risk, said Matt Southam of the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board.\n\nThese include a study published by the WHO in 2015 which made a direct link between consumption of processed meats and bowel cancer. But The Grocer magazine reported that branded bacon is bucking the trend, with sales rising 18.3 per cent last year.\n\nFigures from analysts Kantar show total sales fell 4.7 per cent to \u00a31.2billion, while own-label bacon fared particularly badly with sales down 6 per cent\n\nIt said this was due to \u2018health-driven\u2019 innovations such as Finnebrogue\u2019s Naked Bacon, which does not contain nitrates \u2013 the compounds identified by the WHO as potentially linked to cancer.\n\nHowever, The Grocer said that consumer perceptions could be set to change again after a new study published this week suggested the link between meat and cancer had been overstated.\n\nReducing meat intake brought few if any health benefits, according to a panel of researchers led by Dalhousie University and McMaster University in Canada. Diets lower in processed and red meat had 'little or no effect on the risk for major cardiometabolic outcomes and cancer mortality and incidence' they said.", "description": "Supermarket sales dropped \u00a356.8million in the last year to July.
