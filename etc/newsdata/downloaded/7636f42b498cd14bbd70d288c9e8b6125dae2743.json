The Redskins, who are in the midst of a tough opening schedule, were counting on Guice to be a critical part of the team\u2019s offense as a featured runner they have expressed excitement about since drafting him in the second round last year.\n\nAndrews also operated on Guice last year, after Guice tore the ACL in his left knee during the team\u2019s first preseason game. Gruden had said this week that Guice could return by Sunday\u2019s home opener against the Dallas Cowboys, but two people with knowledge of the situation said Monday that Guice could miss multiple weeks.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGuice, who had worked all last season to get back from his ACL injury and was very enthusiastic in front of his locker after playing in his first regular season game Sunday, expressed optimism in a tweet sent Thursday afternoon. \u201cDon\u2019t feel bad for me!!\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis is what I signed up! It wear and tears on your body over time! I\u2019ve been doing this 15 years!! Trust the process.. head up chin up and grind.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t feel bad for me!! This what I signed up!

Trust the process.. head up chin up and grind \u2014 2\ufe0f\u20e39\ufe0f\u20e3 (@DhaSickest) September 12, 2019\n\nBut the development is probably painful for the Redskins, who described Guice as a steal when they selected him in 2018 \u2014 a player whom they had on the first round of their draft board, according to Doug Williams, Washington\u2019s senior vice president of player personnel.\n\nThere was hope that Guice finally could have a major impact on the offense this year, having recovered after sitting out his rookie season while recovering from his torn ACL. Gruden said last week that the offense would run through Guice, and he felt so confident about Guice\u2019s ability and health status that he didn\u2019t dress 2012 NFL MVP Adrian Peterson, who rushed for 1,042 yards last year in Guice\u2019s absence.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSvrluga: Jay Gruden was already on shaky ground. Benching Adrian Peterson didn\u2019t help.\n\nNow Peterson is back to being the starting running back.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just [been] like a roller coaster, you know?\u201d Peterson said when asked what his emotions were over the past few days. \u201cIt was an all-time high leading up [to the start of the season] to an all-time low and not really understanding and then the climbing to get back up here. But I\u2019m a professional. I\u2019ve been through way worse things than not being active for Week 1.\u201d\n\nLater, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s moving on; for me it\u2019s water under the bridge.\u201d\n\nLate Sunday afternoon, when Gruden still believed Guice had come out of the opener without injury, the coach said the only way he would use Peterson and Guice together is if \u201cwe think we can run the ball 55 times in a game in I-formation.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nGruden\u2019s tone had changed by Wednesday, when he named Peterson the starter if Guice couldn\u2019t play and said he wanted Peterson on the team.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Gruden said when asked whether he and Peterson needed to talk about what happened over the weekend. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked. He\u2019s in a good place. Nobody\u2019s ever happy if you\u2019re the backup or not dressing. But you are still on the team, and when your number is called, you roll. And Adrian is a pro, and I feel very good if his number is called this week he will be ready to go and play very hard and he\u2019ll be Adrian Peterson.\u201d\n\nFor now, Guice\u2019s NFL career is frozen at the 10 carries for 18 yards and the three catches for 20 yards he had Sunday.\n\nAD\n\nPeterson is not as ideal a fit for Gruden\u2019s offense as Guice; he is known for being more of a straight-ahead runner and not a great pass-catching threat. But Peterson worked hard to adapt his game to the offense last season and has repeatedly said his pass-catching numbers were lower in past seasons because his former team, the Minnesota Vikings, was constantly changing quarterbacks.\n\nAD\n\nIn his first meeting last year against this week\u2019s opponent, the Cowboys, Peterson carried 24 times for 99 yards in a 20-17 Washington victory. He had one of his worst games of the season when the teams met again in Dallas later in the season, rushing for only 35 yards in a 31-23 Thanksgiving Day loss.\n\nMark Maske contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nBrewer: Lamar Jackson, Baker Mayfield and the dangers of judging quarterbacks too early\n\nIt\u2019s the bottom of the ninth for Raiders games on a baseball field\n\nAD", "description": "Redskins Coach Jay Gruden said the running back had a \"minor procedure\" Thursday to address the injury, but did not offer a timetable for Guice's return.
