But what links them is that they have good growth runways, are early stage, and all have the ingredients to make them successful investments.\u2019\n\nJP Morgan Japanese: A 58-strong portfolio devoid of most Japanese corporate names UK investors are familiar with \u2013 Mitsubishi, Nippon, Sony and Sumitomo\n\nThree themes underpin some of the companies Weindling invests in \u2013 artificial intelligence, tourism and an ageing population.\n\nThe trust\u2019s biggest holding, Keyence, is a world leader in automation sensors that are used in production lines and are more reliable than humans in rejecting faulty goods.\n\nWeindling says that the sensors pay for themselves in terms of cost savings within two years.\n\nHe adds: \u2018As wages rise and business margins come under pressure, automation will become the norm.\n\nFor example, it\u2019s tiny in China, but when it becomes a feature of production lines there, Keyence should be one of the beneficiaries.\u2019 He has held the stock since 2012.\n\nTourism is booming in Japan and will continue to do so as a result of it staging the Rugby World Cup next month, followed by the Summer Olympics in 2020.\n\nBut Weindling says the stronger theme is the influx of tourists from countries elsewhere in Asia \u2013 China, Indonesia, Taiwan and Vietnam \u2013 all with money to spend.\n\nShiseido, a manufacturer of skincare products and a top 10 trust holding, is a beneficiary of this regional tourism as holidaymakers buy its \u2018quality, reliable and safe\u2019 products.\n\nThe final investment theme \u2013 an ageing population \u2013 is reflected in Recruit Holdings that attempts to marry up vacant jobs with an ever dwindling number of applicants \u2013 100 applicants for every 160 jobs. \u2018Recruit is the number one recruitment agency in Japan,\u2019 says Weindling.\n\n\u2018But it also has business operations in the United States and elsewhere.\u2019\n\nOver the past five years, the \u00a3885million trust has delivered a total return of 116 per cent, compared with the 94 per cent return generated by the average Japanese fund.\n\nCharges at 0.67 per cent a year are competitive. Weindling says the trust wants to remain on the \u2018front foot\u2019 by eliminating the 7 per cent discount that the shares currently trade at, compared to the value of its assets. The trust pays a small annual dividend of 1 per cent.", "description": "Nicholas Weindling prefers to hunt down 'new types' of company that he believes will thrive irrespective of economic boom or bust.", "authors": ["Jeff Prestridge For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
