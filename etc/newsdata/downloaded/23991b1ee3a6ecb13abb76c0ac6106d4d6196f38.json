And if he's being serious, it's officially online now.\n\n\"Sending this tweet through space via Starlink satellite,\" Musk tweeted earlier this morning, followed by a single line saying, \"Whoa, it worked!!\"\n\nWhoa, it worked!! \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) 22 October 2019\n\nStarlink is about 60 satellite launches into its program, though Musk eventually plans to launch as many as 30,000. He's even managed to obtain permission for at least 12,000 of those through FCC filings, though the rest are currently being processed. When completed, the idea is to be able to use the satellite network to beam down high-speed Internet to all corners of the world, especially areas that didn't have reliable access before.\n\nDon't Miss 3.7 K SHARES 1.6 K SHARES 8.4 K SHARES 1.8 K SHARES\n\nOf course, there's been no official announcement just yet, so it's highly likely Musk was just joking around. After all there might be too few satellites currently in orbit for Starlink to function. Also this is Musk we're talking about after all, and his tendency to kid around about serious work stuff.\n\nAt the very least though, maybe it signals Musk is feeling good about the project and it might come to fruition really soon. If we're lucky, we could be looking at the start of the service somewhere in the middle of next year.\n\nAnd of course, let's hope it's available in India too.", "description": "Earlier today, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk tweeted out an update that might be huge.
