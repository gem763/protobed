Gen Z has a knack for incorporating its politics into its internet-inflected, ironic, and earnest self-expression so uncannily, so it\u2019s to be expected that its IRL signs would be as funny, charming, and devastating as the best \u201cclimemes.\u201d\n\nThey did not disappoint, and American strikes haven\u2019t even taken place yet (see you in New York). All around the world, protesters made fun of olds, they lamented missing today\u2019s raid on Area 51, they ask if \u201cDavid Attenbruh\u201d would be their dad. It was another antidote to the insanity of this week\u2019s utterly embarrassing showing on Capitol Hill by climate-science-denying Republicans, who made teens, including hero Greta Thunberg, answer questions like, \u201cWhy should we believe the science?\u201d\n\nIn the words of one of the signs below, \u201cWe\u2019ll be less activist if you be less shit.\u201d\n\nwho made this it is MAGNIFICENT pic.twitter.com/s2KsXqgLdb \u2014 Bella Mackie (@bellamackie) September 20, 2019\n\nNever mind THIS is the best #ClimateStrike sign. \ud83d\ude02 pic.twitter.com/1KwiI3pcW5 \u2014 Jordan Meehan \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 (@JordanMeehan) September 20, 2019\n\nPhoto: Ulrich Baumgarten/U.
