More\n\nBut Labour has hit out at the way the Prime Minister distanced himself from a legally required request to the EU for a Brexit extension which he refused to sign.\n\nShadow chancellor John McDonnell accused Mr Johnson of \u201cbehaving a bit like a spoilt brat\u201d over the issue and has said he believes the prime minister could be held in contempt of parliament over his behaviour.\n\nHowever, despite the anger over Mr Johnson\u2019s behaviour Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab believes the Government can get Boris Johnson's Brexit deal through Parliament - telling Andrew Marr that they \u201chave the numbers\u201d to get Mr Johnson\u2019s deal through.\n\nMr Gove, speaking to Sky News about activating the contingency plan, said: \"The risk of leaving without a deal has actually increased because we cannot guarantee that the European Council will grant an extension.\n\n\"And that is why I will, later today, be chairing a Cabinet committee meeting, extraordinarily on a Sunday, in order to ensure that the next stage of our exit preparations and our preparedness for no-deal is accelerated.\n\n\"It means that we are triggering Operation Yellowhammer.\n\n\"It means that we are preparing to ensure that, if no extension is granted, we have done everything possible in order to prepare to leave without a deal.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove speaks in the House of Commons, London, after Prime Minister Boris Johnson delivered a statement on his new Brexit deal. More\n\nMr Johnson stressed to Brussels he was only sending the communication at Parliament\u2019s bidding.\n\nAfter suffering an embarrassing defeat in the Commons over his Brexit plans, the Prime Minister got a senior diplomat to send Brussels an unsigned photocopy of the call by MPs to delay withdrawal from the bloc, with a cover note stressing his detachment from the move.\n\nIn a second note to European Council president Donald Tusk, the PM said a Brexit extension would be \u201cdeeply corrosive\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking on Sky News\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday, Mr McDonnell said: \u201cHe may well be in contempt of Parliament or the courts themselves because he\u2019s clearly trying to undermine the first letter and not signing the letter.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s behaving a bit like a spoilt brat.\n\n\u201cParliament made a decision, he should abide by it and this idea that you send another letter contradicting the first, I think it flies in the face of what both Parliament and the courts have decided.\u201d\n\nThe PM\u2019s move came after Mr Johnson told the Commons he will not negotiate a fresh Brexit extension with the EU.\n\nMr Tusk tweeted: \u201cThe extension request has just arrived. I will now start consulting EU leaders on how to react. #Brexit\u201d\n\nThe result of the House of Commons vote on the Letwin amendment.
