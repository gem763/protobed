The SurfaceWave processor and engine are available to \u201cany mobile manufacturer.\u201d\n\nBefore this, Sentons had actually already inked direct deals to test out market interest in its technology. There were actually already three smartphones released \u2014 two of which were only sold in Asia (models and customer names undisclosed by Sentons) and one of which is made by Asus in partnership with Tencent, the Republic of Gamers phone (the Air Triggers are powered by Sentons). Jess Lee, the company\u2019s CEO, told me in an interview that there are another 10-12 devices \u201cin process\u201d right now due to be released in coming cycles. He would not comment on whether his former employer is one of them.\n\nSentons has actually been around since 2011 but very much under the radar until this year, when it announced that Lee \u2014 who had been at Apple, after his previous company, the cutting-edge imaging startup InVisage, was acquired by the iPhone maker \u2014 was coming on as CEO.\n\nThe company has quietly raised about $35 million from two investors, NEA and Lee confirmed to me that it\u2019s currently raising another, probably larger, round. (Given the company\u2019s partnership with Tencent and Asus, those are two companies I would think are candidates as strategic investors.)\n\nThe sound of silence\n\nSentons\u2019 core idea is focused around sound \u2014 specifically ultra sound.\n\nIts system is based around a processor that emits ultrasonic \u201cpings\u201d (similar to sonar array, the company says, which is used for example on submarines to navigate and communicate) to detect physical movement and force on the surface of an object. The company says that this technique is much more sophisticated than capacitive touch that has been used on smartphones up to now, since combined with Sentons\u2019 algorithms it can measure force and intent as well as touch.\n\nCombined with the processor that emits the pings and houses the gesture engine, Sentons also uses \u201csensor modules\u201d around the perimeter of a device to detect when those pings are interrupted. The system trains itself and can adjust both to temporal \u201cbuttons\u201d and also other unintended things like when a screen cracks and your gestures move over to a different area of the phone.\n\nGaming \u2014 the main use case for Asus\u2019s ROG phone \u2014 is an obvious category ripe for software-defined surfaces. The medium always strives for more immersive experiences, and as more games are either natively made for phones, or ported there because of the popularity of mobile gaming, handset makers and publishers are always trying to come up with ways to enhance what is, ultimately, very limited real estate (even with larger screens). Using any and all parts of a device to experience motion and other physical responses, and to control the game, is a natural fit for what Sentons has built.\n\nBut the bigger picture and longer term goal is to apply Sentons\u2019 technology for other uses on devices \u2014 photography and building enhanced camera tools is one obvious example \u2014 and on other \u201chardware,\u201d like connected cars, clothes and even the human body, since Sentons\u2019 technology can also work on and through human tissue.\n\n\u201cEvery surface is an opportunity,\u201d Lee said, noting that conversations around health and medical technology are still very early, while other areas like wearables and automotive are seeing \u201cengagement\u201d already. \u201cIn the cabin of a vehicle, you have a wealth of tactile materials, whether it\u2019s leather dashboards or metal buttons, and all of those are extremely interesting to us,\u201d he added.\n\nAt the same time, the more immediate opportunity for Sentons is the mobile industry.\n\nSmartphone sales have slowed down, and for some vendors declined, in recent years; and while some of that might have to do with premium device prices continuing to climb, and much higher smartphone penetration globally, some have laid the blame in part on a lack of innovation. Specifically, newer phones are just not providing enough \u201cmust have\u201d new features to merit making a purchase of a new device if you already have one.\n\nYou could argue that making a technology like this widely available and open to all comers might make those who are trying to make their devices stand out with special features less inclined to jump on the bandwagon.\n\n\u201cYes, you could say there is more value in scarcity, an approach we took in the last company,\u201d Lee said, referring to InVisage and how very under the radar it was before being snapped up by Apple.\n\nHowever, he thinks a different approach is needed here. \u201cWhether we launched this platform to everyone or not, the gates have opened, the pi\u00f1ata has broken, and we see a lot more opportunities and want to go for them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou can call it a multi-pronged approach,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut ensuring the adoption of software-defined interactions [by trying to work with as many companies as possible] gets the technology or use out there quickly.\u201d He noted that when a new gesture is introduced on devices, it can take time for the world to absorb it, \u201cand we are positive there will be followers, perhaps with different technology, that will compete with us, so a broad launch is what we are going for.\u201d", "description": "As handset makers continue to work on ways of making smartphones more streamlined and sleek, while at the same time introducing new features that will get people buying more devices, a startup that is pioneering something called \u201csoftware-defined\u201d surfaces \u2014 essentially, using ultrasound and AI to turn any kind of material, and any kind of [\u2026]", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/posterImage-4815.png?w=568", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
