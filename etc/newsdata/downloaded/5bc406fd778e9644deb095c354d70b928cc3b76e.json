The ministry tweeted: \u201cRas al-Ayn\u2019s residential center has been taken under control through the successful operations in the east of Euphrates\u201d river.\n\nTurkey\u2019s continued push into Syria comes days after U.S. President Donald Trump cleared the way for Turkey\u2019s air and ground offensive, pulling back U.S. forces from the area and saying he wanted to stop getting involved with \u201cendless wars.\u201d Trump\u2019s decision drew swift bipartisan criticism that he was endangering regional stability and risking the lives of Syrian Kurdish allies who brought down the Islamic State group in Syria. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces was the main U.S. ally in the fight against the Islamic State group and lost 11,000 fighters in the nearly five-year battle against the extremists.\n\nAn Associated Press journalist across the border in Turkey heard the sound of sporadic clashes as Turkish howitzers struck the town and Turkish jets screeched overhead.\n\nSyrian Kurdish forces appeared to be holding out in some areas of the town.\n\nThe Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces released two videos said to be from inside Ras al-Ayn, showing fighters saying that it is Saturday and they are still there.\n\nThe fighting was ongoing as the Kurdish fighters sought to reverse the Turkish advance into Ras Al-Ayn, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.\n\nEarlier in the day, Turkish troops moved to seize control of key highways in northeastern Syria, the Turkish military and the Observatory said.\n\nTurkey\u2019s state-run Anadolu news agency said that Turkey-backed Syrian opposition forces had taken control of the M-4 highway that connects the towns of Manbij and Qamishli.\n\nThe SDF said that Turkish troops and their Syrian allies reached the highway briefly before being pushed back again.\n\nTurkish troops also cut the route linking the northeastern city of Hassakeh with Aleppo, Syria\u2019s largest city and once commercial center, according to the Observatory.\n\nSince Wednesday, Turkish troops and Syrian opposition fighters backed by Ankara have been advancing under the cover of airstrikes and artillery shelling, reaching the Manbij-Qamishli road about 30 kilometers (19 miles) south of the Turkish border.\n\nTurkey has said it aims to push back the Syrian Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units, or YPG, which it considers terrorists for its links to a decades-long Kurdish insurgency within its own borders. The YPG is a main component of the SDF.\n\nThe U.N. estimated the number of displaced at 100,000 since Wednesday, saying that markets, schools and clinics also were closed. Aid agencies have warned of a humanitarian crisis, with nearly a half-million people at risk in northeastern Syria.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Friday Turkey won\u2019t stop until the Syrian Kurdish forces withdraw below a 32 kilometer (20 miles) deep line from the border.\n\nThe Turkish military aims to clear Syrian border towns of Kurdish fighters\u2019 presence, saying they are a national security threat.\n\nA civilian wounded in a mortar strike from Syria the previous day in the Turkish border town of Suruc died, Anadolu news agency also reported Saturday, bringing the civilian death toll to 18 in Turkey. Turkey\u2019s interior minister said hundreds of mortars, fired from Syria, have landed in Turkish border towns.\n\nThe Observatory that keeps track of Syria\u2019s civil war said 74 Kurdish-led SDF fighters have been killed since Wednesday as well as 49 Syrian opposition fighters backed by Tukey in addition to 21 civilians on the Syrian side.\n\nTurkey\u2019s defense ministry said it \u201cneutralized\u201d 415 Syrian Kurdish fighters. The number could not be independently verified. Four Turkish soldiers have been killed since the beginning of the offensive, including two who were killed in Syria\u2019s northwest.\n\nFrance\u2019s leader warned Trump in a phone call that Turkey\u2019s military action in northern Syria could lead to a resurgence of Islamic State activity.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron \u201creiterated the need to make the Turkish offensive stop immediately,\u201d his office said in a statement Saturday.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Zeynep Bilginsoy in Istanbul and Bassem Mroue in Beirut contributed to this report.", "description": "Turkey\u2019s continued push into Syria comes days after President Donald Trump cleared the way for Turkey\u2019s air and ground offensive.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da1ebb1210000420734452e.jpeg?cache=3tvbq5hvwo&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
