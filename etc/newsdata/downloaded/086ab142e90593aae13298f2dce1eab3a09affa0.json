However, one of the students, Ryan Neighbors, uses a wheelchair and thought she wouldn't be able to join because of the rugged terrain, her mother told Fox News on Tuesday.\n\nShelly King said that teacher Jim Freeman volunteered to carry Neighbors on his back the entire trip, ensuring the ten-year-old was able to join her classmates.\n\nKing said her daughter has spina bifida, which is a birth defect that occurs when the spine and spinal cord don't form properly, according to The Mayo Clinic. She told Fox News that she initially thought either her daughter would not be able to go on the trip or she would have to join the group and carry her daughter so that she wouldn't be excluded. But when Freeman found out about the situation, he volunteered to help.\n\n\"I was blown away,\" King said. \"Mr. Freeman, he\u2019s not her teacher but he teaches in the classroom next door. That\u2019s what I think makes it so heartfelt because he\u2019s not her teacher. He didn\u2019t have to do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey did not have a super personal relationship before this,\u201d added King, who said that she was grateful that Freeman was so compassionate and willing to help.\n\nBRIDE AND GROOM'S WEDDING CRASHED BY BLACK BEAR DURING INCREDIBLE PHOTO SHOOT\n\nKing wrote on the Facebook page \u201cTeam Ryan\u201d that she was planning an \u201calternate field trip day\u201d for her daughter when Freeman volunteered to \u201ctote [Ryan] around on the falls all day.\u201d\n\nShe wrote that she was touched by the sweet gesture \u2013 and that Ryan was excited she was able to go.\n\n\u201cShe is sooooo excited to do this independent from me,\u201d wrote King, who also posted photos from the field trip showing Ryan enjoying her time.\n\n\u201cOmg MELT MY HEART,\u201d King wrote.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nDuring the field trip, Ryan sat in a carrier that Freeman had on his back.\n\nNeighbors told Fox News \u201cit felt really nice\u201d that she could join her classmates on the field trip.\n\n\u201cI liked it so much,\u201d she said, adding that she learned a lot on the trip. \"We got to see the fossils and the bones \u2026 and I thought it was really fun.\"\n\n\u201cMy friends felt really jealous because I got to have a piggyback ride,\u201d she added.\n\nShe also had a message for Freeman: \u201cThank you.
