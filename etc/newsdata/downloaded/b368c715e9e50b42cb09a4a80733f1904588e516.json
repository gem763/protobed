Despite consulting with the National Security Council, Trump has made key national security decisions which are at odds with their advice, including drawing down troops in Syria.\n\nAnd yet, last month, the Trump administration gave a rare readout of a meeting that Trump held with his national security team on Afghanistan. The administration may have been trying to signal that the President was doing something out of character \u2014 coordinating with his team on key national security issues.\n\nI don\u2019t want the US to bargain away my son\u2019s future in Afghanistan\n\nBut that idea quickly became a fantasy when Trump announced on Fox News Radio last week that the US will be drawing down troops in Afghanistan. Trump said this while the special envoy for Afghan reconciliation is deep in negotiations with the Taliban.", "description": "", "authors": ["Samantha Vinograd", "Cnn.Com Opinions Trump-Bolton-Afghanistan-Security-Concerns-Vinograd Index.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
