That filler has then gone on to cause tissue death.\n\n\"It could have gone up into her face, up along the side of the nose and into her eye, and she could have been rendered blind instantaneously.\"\n\n(Image: A Current Affair)\n\n(Image: A Current Affair)\n\nThe clinic denies any wrongdoing.\n\nIn a statement, it said: \"Laser Clinics totally rejects Ms Stutchbery's allegations.\n\n\"There is no medical evidence that the Laser Clinics treatment caused any infection.\"\n\nIt said the clinic \"followed all appropriate clinical procedures mandated by Laser Clinics and there is no report or finding to the contrary that has been brought to the attention of Laser Clinics to suggest any error.\"\n\nMeanwhile Cosmetic doctor Daniel Lanzar, who was one of the first dermatologists to bring lip fillers and injections to Australia more than two decades ago, is worried about the widespread emergence of clinics offering the services.\n\nHe's spoken out about lip-filler treatments \"that really should be done in a medical room\" and told 9News that he \"never envisaged\" such services would be offered in clinics operating out of shopping centres.\n\n(Image: A Current Affair)\n\nProf Ashton told 9News that he wants a legal loophole allowing qualified doctors to give consultations over Skype or Facetime, to be closed. This means doctors do not have to be on site for the procedures to take place.\n\nHe said: \"The Skype consultation or the FaceTime consultation was originally formulated for rural and regional patients who are trying to get access to specialist care.\n\n\"It's not designed so that someone in a shopping centre can see a GP who's in the same city simply so that he can make more money.\"\n\n9News reports that Laser Clinics Australia said all its processes and protocols where reviewed by a medical advisory board of doctors and dermatologists .", "description": "Mikayla Stutchberry was nearly blinded after lip fillers which were 'injected into the arteries supplying her upper lip' burst", "authors": ["Joseph Wilkes", "Image", "A Current Affair"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20540530.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Mikayla-Stutchbery.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
