The animals were attempting to save each other from the dangerous falls, known locally as Haew Narok \u2014 \"Hell's Fall\" \u2014 according to the publication.\n\nA report sent to the Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation says many elephants were gathered near the waterfall Thursday and Friday, Sky News reports. After officials heard elephant cries coming from the area early Saturday morning, they found a baby elephant drowned part way down the waterfall, the publication says.\n\nTwo male elephants stood on the cliff above the baby elephant; in a ravine below the baby, officials found the bodies of five drowned adult elephants.\n\nElephants in Sri Lanka: Dozens injured after elephants escape handlers during Sri Lanka parade\n\nWorld Wide Fund: Wild animal population plummets 60% over last 40 years\n\nA Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation handout photo dated Oct. 5 shows an aerial view of the deceased animals.\n\nA similar incident that killed eight elephants happened at the same location in 1992, according to the BBC.\n\nThe surviving elephants will likely experience grief.
