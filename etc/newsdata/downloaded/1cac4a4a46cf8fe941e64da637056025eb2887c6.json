(Image: Ivan Reis and Joe Prado, DC Comics)\n\nCan you imagine? (Spoiler alert): It turns out he\u2019s not a bird. Or even a plane. Up there, it\u2019s mild-mannered reporter Clark Kent!\n\nYes, DC Comics is pulling a 2015 (or a 1990, or perhaps even a 1978, depending on how you judge your levels of Superman secret identity outing).\n\nIn this December\u2019s Superman #18, Clark Kent will reveal to the world that his glasses are indeed the universe\u2019s most effective perception-distortion field.\n\nAnd that he\u2019s also the Man of Steel. That too, I guess.\n\nDC Comics already softly revealed the news in solicitations for December comics earlier this week, but in a newly launched interview with the New York Times today, Brian Michael Bendis\u2014who jumped ship from his longstanding position at Marvel Comics a few years ago to take over DC\u2019s primary Superman titles, among other things\u2014lifted the lid on his plans to put Clark Kent into the spotlight.\n\nAs noted above, this is far from the first time this has happened. In his long comics career, Superman has revealed his alter ego to many people in his lives in fits and starts, like his allies in the Justice League, or the people closest to him like Lois Lane.\n\nBut this newest storyline will see Clark\u2019s identity become known publicly to the world, heroes, villains, and civilians alike, and draws most comparisons to the 2015 storyline that saw the same thing happen. Then, in order to counter the threat of a blackmailing hacker threatening to expose Superman, Lois outed Clark\u2019s secret online. He even got a \u201cnew\u201d secret identity out of it that lasted for approximately three seconds!\n\nAnyway, all that has now been retconned out of continuity, because, y\u2019know, comics\u2014so the pathway is clear for Bendis to tell this story all over again. Or, as he mostly focuses on in this new interview, attempting to convince rightly sceptical comic book fans that no, for real, this will matter and have ramifications.\n\n\u201cLet me lean into this a little bit because I\u2019m with you on that,\u201d Bendis told the Times when specifically asked about fans being wary that this wasn\u2019t just some shock tactic to grab a headline. \u201cI don\u2019t do fake-out stories. I did a story where Daredevil was outed \u2014 a different kind of outing \u2014 but that was his reality for 15 years,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe wanted to do this because behind it is 1,000 brand-new Superman stories that have never been told.\u201d\n\nNothing will ever be the same, you see.\n\nThose \u201cbrand-new Superman stories\u201d will kick off in earnest with the January release of two special one-shot issues\u2014one of which is titled Superman: Heroes\u2014that will examine the international and interpersonal reactions across the DC universe to Clark\u2019s identity reveal, among heroes and villains alike.\n\nAlthough details are being kept under wraps at the moment, Bendis teased collaborations with writers Matt Fraction and Greg Rucka on the issues, which will examine concepts like how Clark can conceivably continue to be an ethical journalist in the wake of the reveal, and will also apparently see one teased villain of the DC universe switch to the side of heroes after learning the news.\n\nFor now, we\u2019ll have to take Bendis\u2019 word for just how all this will play out in the years to come. Superman #18, by Bendis, Joe Prado, and Ivan Reis, will hit shelves December 11.", "description": "Can you imagine? (Spoiler alert): It turns out he\u2019s not a bird. Or even a plane.
