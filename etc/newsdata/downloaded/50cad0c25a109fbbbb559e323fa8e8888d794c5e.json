For the U.S., the rate is well over 700 prisoners for each 100,000 of population. According to a recent BBC report, the only close contender is Russia, with an imprisonment rate of over 600 per 100,000 population. Most other developed countries are far behind\u2014or ahead, in social-welfare terms. The rate for England and Wales, for instance, is under 150 prisoners per 100,000 population. Mexico\u2019s rate is about 200 per 100,000. China, with a national population four times larger than America\u2019s, has fewer total prisoners (at least according to official reports).\n\nJust under 10 percent of America\u2019s prisoners are women. Men and women who are \u201creturning citizens\u201d face some common challenges in restoring their place in economic, family, civic, and social life\u2014for instance, the stigma of a criminal record. Some other barriers vary by gender. Women are statistically more likely to be expected to care for children or other family members, men more likely to have been arrested for violent offenses.\n\nIn Indianapolis, a program called Project Lia helps women who are leaving prison reenter economic and social life. As its mission statement puts it:\n\nThe Project Lia program is for women rebuilding their lives after incarceration. Program participants receive educational opportunities in financial literacy, communication, business ethics, and health and wellness, as well [as] support for a future job search. Our program length is designed to be 6 months\u201312 months. As you advance through our technical skills and life skills program curriculum, you may advance in job title and pay, with the goal being a successful transition to a long-term career opportunity.\n\nIn two previous installments, we\u2019ve shared videos from our friends at New America about civic-renewal projects in Indiana that are very important in the state but get little national attention. The first, about a successful job-training program called Build Your Future, is here. The second, about an ambitious public-arts project run by the Big Car Collaborative, is here.\n\nNow a third video, about how Project Lia is trying to help previously incarcerated women regain their economic and social footing.\n\nAs you can see from Project Lia\u2019s site, its emphasis is on \u201crenewal\u201d in the broadest sense of the term. Toward its aim of helping its graduates begin rebuilding their lives, many of its projects involve reviving disused or abandoned buildings, as you\u2019ll see in this video, and recycling material that would otherwise just go to landfills.\n\nThanks to the videographer and editor Michael Jensen, the executive producer Fuzz Hogan, plus our other friends at New America.", "description": "", "authors": ["James Fallows"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/notes/2019/10/Screen_Shot_2019_10_07_at_10.55.30_AM/facebook.png?1570477138", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
