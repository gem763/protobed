Sandwiched between the pillow-soft pastry is a creamy pumpkin filling bursting with cinnamon spice and nutmeg. And the macaron\u2019s bright pumpkin-orange hue also evokes a cheerful fall spirit. The Pumpkin Spice macaron tastes feather light while also not skimping on flavor. $2.97. 3270 M St. NW; 1961 Chain Bridge Rd., McLean ; 7101 Democracy Blvd., Bethesda. oliviamacaron.com.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPumpkin cinnamon milkshake at Toby's Homemade Ice Cream\n\nToby Bantug says that the seasonal pumpkin flavored ice cream isn\u2019t quite the home run hit compared with the other flavors at the Westover ice cream shop that bears his name. But it should be \u2014 the silky ice cream is still satisfying as fall\u2019s chillier temperatures kick in. When blended together with the store\u2019s cinnamon ice cream, a magical milkshake is made. The finished product tastes like a hulking slice of Thanksgiving pumpkin pie \u2014 it\u2019s not as sweet, but just as comforting. Top it off with a dab of whipped cream, and you\u2019ve got yourself a dreamy, creamy dessert. $4.77 for a regular, $5.68 for a large. 5849 Washington Blvd., Arlington. tobysicecream.com.\n\nThe Great Pumpkin atBaked and Wired\n\nBaked and Wired serves up some of the best and most inventive desserts in town, especially once fall arrives. Its seasonal offering, the Great Pumpkin, doubles down on toasty fall flavoring: The hearty pumpkin cupcake is topped with a rich pumpkin spice cream cheese frosting, a sprinkling of cinnamon and toasted pumpkin seeds. It\u2019s also big enough to split with a friend \u2014 but you\u2019re probably going to want to eat the delectable dessert yourself. If you\u2019re hankering for more pumpkin treats, Baked and Wired also offers pumpkin whoopee pies for $3.75 a pop. $4.10. 1052 Thomas Jefferson St. NW. bakedandwired.com.\n\nPumpkin spice latte\n\ncr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e doughnut at District Doughnut\n\nBiting into District Doughnut\u2019s playful take on a Pumpkin Spice Latte unleashes a menagerie of flavors. The pumpkin-based dough and crunchy caramelized sugar are intense enough on their own. But the real kicker is when you get to the center, which reveals a spicy yet sweet pumpkin pie filling. Besides the pumpkin spice latte cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, District Doughnut offers other seasonal treats such as the pumpkin glazed and sweet potato pie, which is made with pumpkin dough, stuffed with sweet potato pie filling and topped with marshmallow glaze. $3.85. 749 Eighth St. SE; 3327 Cady\u2019s Alley NW; 5 Market Square SW; 1309 Fifth St NE; 4238 Wilson Blvd. Arlington. districtdoughnut.com.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis is Halloween at Beetle House DC\n\nAfter opening locations in New York and Los Angeles, Beetle House has made its way to D.C. as what promises to be the city\u2019s only year-round Halloween bar. The first level is reserved for dinner, but if you want just drinks, make your way to the second floor. Stroll inside the dimly-lit interior \u2014 past the coffin and wall of decorative human skulls \u2014 and order This is Halloween. Beneath the thin layer of dry ice fog is a festive cocktail made with pumpkin liqueur and Fireball Cinnamon Whisky, which is given an extra sweet kick with apple cider and sour apple. The apple flavor keeps the Fireball from overpowering the drink, while not being too cloying. And though it doesn\u2019t quite have the zesty pumpkin taste of the other spiced treats on this list, it\u2019s still an honorable take on a storied seasonal flavor. $14. 816 H St. NE. beetlehousenyc.com.\n\nAD", "description": "Get that fall flavor in cupcake, milkshake or macaron form.", "authors": ["Stephanie Williams"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Ny9dhU0EpDinhFliMvy4I46zmOs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QGDPHEXOWAI6TNSIO26PQ3VWPY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
