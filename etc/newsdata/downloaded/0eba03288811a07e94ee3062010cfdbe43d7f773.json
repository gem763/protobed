Because in the days since last weekend\u2019s dramatic 23-21 loss to France, his approach has been all about re-building the squad dynamic rather than pandering to the wounded pride of big-name players.\n\n\u201cThe message hasn\u2019t changed, not just from this staff, but from any the Pumas have ever had. The key thing in wearing the Pumas\u2019 shirt is to do your best,\u201d Ledesma said. \u201cNobody can take it for granted. Everyone who\u2019s worn this shirt knows it. That\u2019s the name of the game.\u201d\n\nLedesma, a hooker who played 84 times for Argentina, usually talks to players who have been left out and explains to them why. But he felt he needed a change, perhaps sensing something had been lacking in the game against France.\n\n\u201cI believe this week we had to think collectively, as a group,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil last week we always took the time to talk with those not selected, but this week was different.\u201d\n\nCreevy has 12 appearances at the World Cup, while Sanchez has notched a career 102 World Cup points. But neither player is bigger than the Argentine cause - which is to win the next three Pool C games against Tonga, 2003 champion England, and the United States.\n\nExpect Ledesma\u2019s players to come out firing early on with some aggressive front-foot rugby at Hanazono Rugby stadium, on the outskirts of Osaka.\n\nIt would be the best way for the Pumas to banish the memory of a dismal first-half performance against France, which led 20-3 at the break last Saturday.\n\n\u201cOur mindset (is) very ambitious, perhaps, but we must do what we set out to do,\u201d Ledesma said. \u201cAgainst France, we didn\u2019t in the first 40 minutes, so this time we must remain focused and overcome our mistakes. The most dangerous teams are the ones who aren\u2019t afraid to make mistakes.\u201d\n\nThe players made plenty of those against France. So the overall intensity went up a notch this week, especially on the eve of the team announcement.\n\n\u201c(Wednesday\u2019s) training session was especially hard because everyone wants to play,\u201d captain Pablo Matera said. \u201cThere was great frustration and annoyance at the weekend\u2019s result and we channeled it into energy, motivation, and improvement.\u201d\n\nThe loss was particularly galling for the coaches and players because of the massive time spent preparing - and then how quickly everything learned was forgotten.\n\n\u201cIt was the longest preparation we have ever gone through in the history of this team. It took many months where we were dedicated to studying every French player, their strengths and weaknesses,\u201d Matera said. \u201cThen, we didn\u2019t get the result and it was tough, because watching it, it was (our fault) \u2026 We didn\u2019t do any of what we had been preparing.\u201d\n\nTonga has had one day less to prepare after losing 35-3 to England in a physical match which resulted in flyhalf Kurt Morath being ruled out of the tournament because of injury.\n\nIt deprives Tonga of its strategist, a proven playmaker with the nation\u2019s record for World Cup (73) and all-time (340) points. He is replaced by James Faiva, whose five caps have all come in the last two months.\n\nBut Ledesma doesn\u2019t expect any changes to how Tonga approaches the game.\n\nA Morath-inspired Tonga bossed the Pumas in the first 20 minutes when they met at the World Cup four years ago, but then faded away in a 45-16 loss.\n\n\u201cThey have a system which may not always work but is very similar to ours in terms of how the players are structured,\u201d Ledesma said. \u201cAny player can make a difference and danger may come from all sides.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Mario Ledesma sent a message to his Argentina squad by dropping arguably the most influential player and the former captain for Saturday's must-win Rugby World Cup game against Tonga.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jerome Pugmire"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
