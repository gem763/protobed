A Spice Girl judging drag queens spouting filth while impersonating celebrities? Nothing could be further up my street.\n\nBut when it came to it, Geri was less Ginger Spice, more flat lemonade or dry toast, as she winced and balked her way through judging.\n\nNow 47, Geri didn\u2019t seem to understand the jokes Mama Ru was telling (\u2018Geri, the eye is the window to the hole. That\u2019s not a happy hole\u2019) and groaned \u2018oh no\u2019 as one queen, Sum Ting Wong, inserted a clearly fake syringe into her mouth to symbolise plastic surgery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Look At Me singer then looked horrified as another queen, Crystal, gave an angle-grinding performance on stage, and praised a non-filthy impersonation of Margaret Thatcher, saying: \u2018You had the balance of that British sensibility about you. A little bit Carry On, but you don\u2019t have to be filthy.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nPerhaps the most shocking moment was when Divina De Campo did a fairly tame impersonation of Victoria Beckham, mocking her for \u2018not being a***d\u2019 to join the Spice Girls reunion tour \u2013 with Geri wincing and saying it was \u2018a little bit\u2019 too savage.\n\nYep, Geri Halliwell is long gone, people. It\u2019s the end of an era.\n\nGeri Halliwell was born to be a popstar. In 1995, she burst onto the scene with the Spice Girls, with flame-coloured hair, a skimpy wardrobe and platform boots as she essentially talked her way through the hits of the soon-to-be biggest girl group in the world.\n\nGeri was the biggest hellraiser (Picture: Anwar Hussein/WireImage)\n\nShe didn\u2019t need to be the best singer \u2013 apparently, she attempted to skip the first audition because she knew she wouldn\u2019t get through \u2013 because she had the star quality. Out of all the Spice Girls, Geri embodied her persona \u2013 Ginger Spice \u2013 the most. She was fiery, she was feminist, she was gobby.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of the Spice Girls\u2019 most iconic moments were down to Geri. She was the one who kissed Prince Charles and patted his bum at a concert for the Princes\u2019 Trust. Geri was the one wearing Union Jack tea towel as a dress at the 1997 Brit Awards \u2013 which was voted the best Brits moment of 30 years of the show. She made her solo debut with a video that saw Ginger Spice being buried in a funeral. Geri was the epitome of a hell-raising popstar.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why I was so crushed as I tuned into RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race UK to find that that woman \u2013 the popstar who emerged from a pair of gigantic parting legs at the Brits, dancing on a pole, surrounded by shirtless men before ripping off her own top \u2013 is gone, to be replaced by a bit of a prude.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve been given reason to doubt the Ginger Spice persona. In 2007, Geri dismissed being a feminist, telling the Guardian: \u2018For me, feminism is bra-burning lesbianism. It\u2019s very unglamorous\u2026 We need to see a celebration of our femininity and softness.\u2019\n\nIn 2013, she hailed Margaret Thatcher as \u2018the First Lady of Girl Power\u2019. And the Spice Girls reunion tour saw her ditch her fashions of old for a ballgown.\n\nGeri has left behind her old persona (Picture: Dave J Hogan/Getty Images)\n\nNow, I know that time has passed. Geri is now 47, is married to Christian Horner and has two children. I didn\u2019t expect her be dancing on top of the Drag Race panel table in a tea towel and thigh-high boots. But I did expect some of the Ginger Spice sass to remain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGeri hasn\u2019t abandoned her popstar life and retreated into a life of solitude \u2013 her last solo single was released two years ago and she was one of the driving forces behind the Spice Girls reunion. I had assumed that any one of the Spice Girls, one of the campest acts ever, would see an array of boundary-pushing drag queens as their cup of tea \u2013 even Victoria brought the drag Spice Girls to fashion week.\n\nBut Geri forgot that she was one of the leading ladies in pushing boundaries in fashion, performance and attitude in the entertainment industry not that long ago.\n\nNot only that, she hasn\u2019t just lost that Ginger edge \u2013 she seemed to have lost all sense of humour when it came to judging the queens on the campest show on TV.\n\nAs a child of the 90s, the Spice Girls are peak pop for me. Having never been to see them as a kid, I was overjoyed to watch them at the reunion tour, and was transported back to an age of true girl power at Wembley thanks to Baby, Scary, Sporty and Ginger. I believed that the nostalgia was keeping the Spice Girls alive, and that their personas, like friendship, would never end.\n\nBut it seems that the Ginger we all loved now only exists through YouTube clips.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the old saying goes, you should never meet your heroes \u2013 or watch them be themselves on a drag show.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
