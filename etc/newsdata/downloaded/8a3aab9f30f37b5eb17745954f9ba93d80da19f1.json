She spoke out against the proposed path of the Keystone XL pipeline through South Dakota, which she said is \u201cnot morally defensible.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndigenous peoples have been leading this fight for centuries,\u201d Thunberg said. \u201cThey have taken care of the planet and they have lived in balance with nature and we need to make sure that they\u2019re voices are being heard. We need to listen to them because they have knowledge that is valuable right now.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking was Tokata Iron Eyes, a 16-year-old from Pine Ridge who planned the rally and invited Thunberg to speak at the Pine Ridge and Standing Rock reservations.\n\n\u201cWe are marching for our lives, we are marching for climate justice and we are marching for indigenous rights at the same time - because those two things go hand in hand,\u201d Iron Eyes said. \u201cThere\u2019s no one without the other. Indigenous people need to be in the forefront of the climate movement because we are the frontline communities who are suffering the most from this crisis and Greta knows that.\u201d\n\nThunberg plans to appear Tuesday on the North Dakota side of the Standing Rock Reservation.\n\nA police spokesman tells the Rapid City Journal that up to 400 people attended the rally.\n\nThunberg traveled to the United States in August on a sailboat to promote her climate change campaign.
