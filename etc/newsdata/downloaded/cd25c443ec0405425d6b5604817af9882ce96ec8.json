That is the intensive, secret phase of talks where the teams have settled the main issues in principle and are trying to thrash out a joint legal text.\n\nIn theory we should not now hear much from either side until they emerge to present the finished article.\n\nA waypointer on progress could come on Sunday, when German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French president Emmanuel Macron are due to meet for dinner.\n\nAn image was projected on the cliffs of Dover today highlighting the countdown to October 31, when the UK is due to leave the EU\n\nWhen will we know if they have been successful?\n\nParliament is due to return for the Queen's Speech on Monday, with all the usual pomp and ceremony.\n\nBoris Johnson will have been carefully assessing whether the emerging new package can keep his fragile political coalition together and get a Commons majority - with all eyes on the views of the DUP.\n\nIn Brussels on Monday, the EU will 'take stock' of progress with Mr Barnier over whether the legal text meets their criteria and can be put before leaders for approval.\n\nAre there any more hurdles once the legal text is thrashed out?\n\nA final deal would be put before EU leaders for approval at a summit in Brussels on October 17-18.\n\nThere would then be a make-or-break vote in the Commons on October 19 - which is set to be the first time Parliament has sat on a Saturday since the Falklands War.\n\nIf passed by the Commons, the government will start rushing legislation through Parliament immediately. Once the necessary laws are in place, an election will almost certainly be called.\n\nHow about if the 'tunnel' collapses?\n\nIf the talks have broken down, expect Mr Johnson either to boycott the EU summit, or stage a dramatic walkout saying he wants to leave with No Deal at Halloween.\n\nBut EU leaders could still offer an extension, in the hope that an election or referendum will change the balance.\n\nIf there is no Brexit deal by October 19, Remainer legislation obliges the PM to beg the EU for an extension until at least January.\n\nMr Johnson is likely to force a vote to make MPs 'own' any delay, having said he would rather 'die in a ditch' than accept one.\n\nHe could also try to find a loophole in the rebel law, although few people believe there is one.\n\nCould the government stagger on if the PM is forced to delay Brexit?\n\nOnce an extension is in place, Jeremy Corbyn has said he will finally let Mr Johnson trigger an election.\n\nMonday October 21 would probably be the first day when a motion can be brought to a vote under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, or a confidence vote can be held.\n\nLegally there must be 25 working days between Parliament being dissolved and the election being held.\n\nNovember 28 looks the favourite date, given they are traditionally held on Thursdays. Going the confidence vote route would delay things by another fortnight, as there is a 'cooling off' period where someone else could demonstrate they can put together a Commons majority and take over as PM.\n\nGiven the Parliamentary numbers and deep splits among opposition parties, this appears highly unlikely to happen.\n\nIf Mr Johnson wins he will push ahead with taking the UK out as quickly as possible, with or without a deal.\n\nMr Corbyn has said he will renegotiate a new deal within three months, and then hold a second referendum between that package and Remain.\n\nAre Remainer MPs just going to let all this happen?\n\nMany Labour MPs and a number of former Tory rebels want a 'confirmatory' referendum to be held before an election. They are plotting to try and call a vote on October 19, whether or not there is a deal.\n\nIf an amendment laying the ground for a national vote is passed, it would probably require a \u2018unity\u2019 government to follow the plan through.\n\nBut that could take months, and would leave the country essentially without a functional leadership.", "description": "The Brexit process has already undergone a bewildering array of twists and turns - but the drama is set to intensify again over the coming fortnight.", "authors": ["James Tapsfield", "Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/16/19595766-0-image-a-13_1570807640220.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
