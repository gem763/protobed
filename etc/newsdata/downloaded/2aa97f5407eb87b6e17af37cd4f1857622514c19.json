Actually, you can make a real difference.\n\nResearch suggests that people with a strong support network may be able to feel less pain and are better able to deal with their condition. People with good friends in their lives may even have an increased chance of survival.\n\nSo far from being useless in this situation, you can really do some good \u2013 mostly just with sustained loyalty, tact and love. There are a few things worth thinking about here. Let\u2019s go through them, shall we?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t be offended if they don\u2019t want to see you\n\nOften, people with a serious condition have to live their life day to day, not knowing if they\u2019re going to wake up to a good day or a bad day.\n\nTheir symptoms can flare up without much notice, which can make socialising difficult to follow through on. Try to be extra flexible with your mate, don\u2019t take it personally if they need to postpone and be open to last minute changes to plans. Learn to forgive quickly and make it really clear you understand.\n\nYou do not want your friend adding shame or guilt to the way they feel because they are uncomfortable about bailing on something you\u2019ve organised together.\n\nGive them the option to get out of dinner or brunch easily and suggest another time to hang out.\n\nGo for practical gestures\n\nIt\u2019s delightful to be emotionally supportive so do reiterate how much this person means to you \u2013 but it\u2019s also really helpful to be pragmatic and opt for practical gestures of support.\n\nAsk if your friend would like you to accompany them to a doctor\u2019s appointment or to cook them a meal if they\u2019re not up for preparing something delicious for themselves.\n\nBring them their favourite trashy magazine, take their dog for a walk, bake or turn up with a jar of pesto and a pack of tortellini. You can offer to drop things over, pick things up, do some driving or simply be on decent snack duty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRunning a life with serious illness can be arduous \u2013 try and lighten their load a little.\n\nReiterating how much this person means to you is lovely, but make sure your contact is relatively constant (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nMake your long term support clear\n\nSecretly, your friend might be living in fear that you will get bored, or impatient, or run out of empathy and eventually abandon them. Some serious illnesses are for life so try and make it clear that your companionship is too.\n\nReiterating how much this person means to you is lovely, but make sure your contact is relatively constant. Be proactive and diligent about being there for them, in health and in sickness.\n\nSay out loud (or by text) that you care about them and show them you mean it by remaining a reliable, compassionate support in their life.\n\nResearch their condition\n\nIt can be difficult to explain your symptoms to someone, even if you\u2019re close and especially if they\u2019re in any way embarrassing.\n\nIt\u2019s absolutely worth doing a little research on your friend\u2019s condition so you\u2019re informed, and it can save them from having to give you a medical summary of what they go through.\n\nNo need to be an expert, just some basic information is a really good idea. Don\u2019t be too invasive with questions about their illness either \u2013 instead, go for some more general, open-ended offers to talk about it, if that\u2019s what they\u2019d like to do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuggest low-key hangout sessions\n\nIf your friend is in pain, exhausted, scared or exasperated by their illness, they\u2019re probably not going to fancy any sort of high-energy social situation.\n\nThey might not want, or even be able to go to parties, clubs or loud places.\n\nWhen you\u2019re planning how you\u2019ll spend your time together, think about their energy levels, their access to certain locations and their capacity to join in on what you have planned.\n\nYou might like to make it perfectly clear that you don\u2019t mind what you do together, even if it\u2019s just hanging out at home with a cup of tea, in front of Netflix.\n\nYour friend might really appreciate having the option of some low-key hangout sessions. One-on-one time is also way less overwhelming than the dynamics and demands of a group situation.\n\nLearn to listen \u2013 because it\u2019s not about you\n\nWhen your friend does want to talk about what they\u2019re going through, practice active listening, rather than rushing to offer a cure or a solution.\n\nReally, properly listen to what they have to say and respond sensitively.\n\nPrompt them with tactful, relevant questions but don\u2019t pry. It\u2019s a delicate art, active listening, and so often so many of us forget to try it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, resist the temptation to make every conversation about you. It\u2019s lovely to be compassionate but if your friend has ME or chronic fatigue, for example, and she\u2019s talking about how tired she is, don\u2019t tell her you know how she feels. It\u2019s not about you and you don\u2019t have to offer up your own experience to make her feel heard.\n\nPay her the courtesy of listening to what she\u2019s going through, acknowledging that it must be really difficult and giving her the chance to be candid about how she feels.\n\nAs her friend, it\u2019s probably the greatest favour you can do for her.\n\nMORE: Mother battling cancer gives birth to healthy \u2018miracle baby\u2019\n\nMORE: Incredible photoshoot showcases the honest realities of living with cancer\n\nMORE: Is having itchy boobs a sign of breast cancer?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "In her weekly advice column for Metro.co.uk, Kate Leaver looks at how to support a friend through a serious illness.", "authors": ["Kate Leaver"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/sei_54394745-be52_1571908201.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
