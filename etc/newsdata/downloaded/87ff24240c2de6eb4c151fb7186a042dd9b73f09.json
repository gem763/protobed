According to a senior Democratic aide, Trump\u2019s \u201cthird-grade politician\u201d insult came during an exchange in which the president was trying to blame former President Barack Obama for the situation in Syria.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama drew a red line in the sand,\u201d Trump told Pelosi, per the aide. \u201cIn my opinion, you are a third-grade politician.\u201d\n\nIn response, Pelosi said she told Trump: \u201cI wish you were a politician, Mr. President, so then you\u2019d know the art of the possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cI asked the president what his plan was to contain ISIS,\u201d Schumer said, referencing the hundreds of self-described Islamic State supporters that escaped detention in northern Syria. \u201cHe didn\u2019t really have one.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Democratic aide, Schumer asked Trump if his plan was to \u201crely on the Syrians and the Turks.\u201d The president answered that his plan was to \u201ckeep the American people safe,\u201d to which Pelosi responded: \u201cThat\u2019s not a plan. That\u2019s a goal.\u201d\n\nThe Democrats added that Trump said some members of ISIS are \u201ccommunists\u201d and that that \u201cmight make you happy.\u201d They said the topic of impeachment did not come up in the meeting.\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said that Trump \u201cwas measured, factual and decisive, while Speaker Pelosi\u2019s decision to walk out was baffling, but not surprising,\u201d according to PBS.\n\nNEW: White House Press Secretary tells me: \"The President was measured, factual and decisive, while Speaker Pelosi\u2019s decision to walk out was baffling, but not surprising...While democratic leadership chose to storm out ... everyone else in the meeting chose to stay in the room.\" pic.twitter.com/eoxZaZ6Nzz \u2014 Yamiche Alcindor (@Yamiche) October 16, 2019\n\nThe meeting came after what Pelosi said was \u201ca very difficult time\u201d for Trump, referencing the House\u2019s nonbinding resolution that opposes the president\u2019s withdrawal of U.S. troops from northern Syria. Pelosi tried to go through the basic parts of the resolution at the meeting, which the House voted in favor of 354-60 on Wednesday.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans overwhelmingly condemned Trump\u2019s decision to effectively greenlight Turkey\u2019s invasion of the region, a move that put America\u2019s Kurdish allies in danger, would likely lead to a resurgence of ISIS and open up the region for Russia to move in.\n\n\u201cThat vote \u2026 probably got to the president, because he was shaken up by it. And that\u2019s why we couldn\u2019t continue in the meeting because he was just not relating to the reality of it,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cAgain, we are proud of our men and women in uniform. Those who have been in Syria have conducted themselves in a way that makes us all very proud, and I conveyed that to the chairmen of the joint chiefs.\u201d\n\nAccording to a senior Democratic aide, Pelosi noted at the meeting that Russia has always wanted a \u201cfoothold in the Middle East,\u201d and added that Trump\u2019s actions in Syria have now allowed it to be possible.\n\n\u201cAll roads with you lead to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,\u201d she reportedly told the president.\n\nAfter the Democrats\u2019 press conference, Trump tweeted out this photo of what appears to be the moment Pelosi stood up to leave the meeting.\n\nTrump signed an executive order on Monday to impose sanctions and visa bans on top Turkish government leaders as a way to punish them for the country\u2019s forces invading Syria, and said that a small number of U.S. troops would remain in the country.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Trump undermined the long-standing alliance between U.S. and Kurdish forces who have been fighting alongside each other against ISIS in Syria. The president said the Kurds are \u201cnot angels,\u201d and that Turkey\u2019s invasion of Syria is \u201cnot our problem,\u201d even though Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo were scheduled to travel to Turkey on Wednesday to negotiate a cease-fire.\n\nThe president\u2019s foreign policy moves have brought bipartisan backlash from world leaders, human rights groups and lawmakers, including Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). The Senate is introducing its own sanctions bill against Turkey, saying that Trump\u2019s orders aren\u2019t enough.\n\n\u201cI told the president that being from New York, as he was, we\u2019re particularly aware of the problems that terrorism, that an organization like ISIS can create,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cAnd the fact that someone no less than General [Jim] Mattis has said that ISIS has been enhanced, that the danger of ISIS is so much greater, worries all of us.\u201d\n\nMattis was Trump\u2019s defense secretary until December 2018, when he resigned over foreign policy disagreements and his opinion that ISIS would resurge if Trump withdrew troops from the Middle East. In the meeting with congressional leaders on Wednesday, Trump allegedly called Mattis the \u201cworld\u2019s most overrated general,\u201d a Democratic source familiar with the meeting told HuffPost.\n\nA Dem source familiar with WH mtg says Trump called Mattis \"the world\u2019s most overrated general. You know why? He wasn\u2019t tough enough. I captured ISIS. Mattis said it would take 2 yrs. I captured them in 1 month\" \u2014 Amanda Terkel (@aterkel) October 16, 2019\n\n\u201cYou know why? He wasn\u2019t tough enough,\u201d Trump said, according to the source. \u201cI captured ISIS. Mattis said it would take two years. I captured them in one month.\u201d\n\nAt the meeting, Trump told Pelosi: \u201cI hate ISIS more than you do,\u201d according to a senior Democratic aide. Pelosi responded that he does not know that.\n\nThe meeting reportedly continued after Pelosi and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) walked out in response to Trump\u2019s berating, with Schumer following shortly after. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said in a press conference after the meeting that he sees \u201ca pattern of behavior with\u201d Pelosi.\n\n\u201cShe storms out of another meeting, trying to make it unproductive,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cThe other Democrats stayed and actually had a very productive meeting.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with an aide\u2019s account of comments during the meeting.", "description": "The Senate minority leader said the president berated the House speaker when congressional leaders met with him to discuss his actions on Turkey.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da77af6210000311034a293.jpeg?cache=w07kygxflx&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
