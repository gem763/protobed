You can do whatever you want outside of the ring, but inside of the ring when it\u2019s fight time, like Mike Tyson said, everyone has a plan until you get hit,\u2019 Ruiz Jr said.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s going to try and win by points, especially since he\u2019s going to be running around.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018My job is to cut the ring, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve been training for.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t really worry about what he\u2019s doing, you know. We have to worry about what we\u2019re doing. He has to train hard.\n\n\u2018I feel that he has more pressure than I do. I just have to do what I have to do, and just let my hands go and focus.\n\n\u2018He even said at one of the press conferences, he said that he was gonna be boxing around.\n\nRuiz Jr thinks AJ is giving his game plan away (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018He kinda told me his strategy, but whatever he does we\u2019re gonna do the best we can to do our thing.\n\n\u2018I think the main thing I\u2019ve gotta do is just let my hands go and throw my combinations.\u2019\n\nMuch has been made of Ruiz Jr and Joshua\u2019s body transformations in recent weeks, but the Mexican insisted he isn\u2019t planning any drastic changes.\n\nHe said: \u2018I kind of wanted to be a little heavier because Anthony Joshua\u2019s big. I wanted to carry his weight, take the punches well but I think being 10lbs lighter, I\u2019m going to be a better fighter.\u2019\n\nMORE: Andy Ruiz Jr targets 10lbs weight loss to improve hand speed for Anthony Joshua rematch", "description": "Andy Ruiz Jr believes Anthony Joshua has given away his game plan for their rematch with his attempts to slim down.
