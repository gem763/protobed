Under that model, Hong Kong is considered part of China but maintains its own political and legal systems, attributes that are attractive to foreign businesses and financiers. Unlike Hong Kong, the Communist Party controls the courts in China and makes judges pledge loyalty to it.\n\nBeijing\u2019s actions in response to the protests have raised questions about how long the current arrangement can last. Fitch said that Chinese officials are taking \u201ca more public stance on Hong Kong affairs than at any time since the 1997 handover.\u201d\n\n\u201cFitch expects the \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 framework to remain intact, but the gradual rise in Hong Kong\u2019s economic, financial, and sociopolitical linkages with the mainland implies its continued integration into China\u2019s national governance system, which will present greater institutional and regulatory challenges over time,\u201d said the credit rating firm.", "description": "The ratings firm cited Beijing\u2019s growing influence over the city, suggesting that the barriers separating their legal and financial systems were blurring.", "authors": ["Sui-Lee Wee"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/06/world/06hkecon1/06hkecon1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
