Those are both huge leaps from the battery lives of the iPhone XS Max and iPhone XS, which were 29.5 hours and 27.5 hours, respectively.\n\nTo gauge a realistic estimate of a phone's battery life, the tests used a robotic finger that used the phones periodically throughout the day in a way meant to resemble the average phone user.\n\nApple has made the improved battery life of its newest iPhones a huge selling point, touting next-generation battery hardware and more efficient processors that use less energy.\n\nTriple lenses make iPhone cameras competitive with Galaxy and Pixel\n\nApple has caught some flack for the quirky appearance of three separate lenses on the back of the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max, but the new and improved cameras put the smartphones on similar footing with Samsung's and Google's offerings.\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max both feature an ultra-wide lens, which most of Samsung's recent phones also boast, and their new Night Mode is similar to a feature already available on Google's Pixel phones.\n\nRead more: Apple's new iOS 13 iPhone update has a security flaw that lets you bypass the lock screen to view contact lists\n\nThe most durable iPhones yet\n\nTesters found that the body and screens of the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max are more durable than any past iPhone model, thanks to stronger glass screens and more robust water resistance.\n\nTo test their durability, Consumer Reports submerges each smartphone underwater, and places each phone in a tumbler that drops the phones from approximately 2.5 feet 100 times. While all the new iPhones passed the water resistance test, only the iPhone 11 Pro Max survived the drop test \u2014 the iPhone 11 Pro screen broke after 50 drops.\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro Max and 11 Pro start at $1,100 and $1,000, respectively.
