Clarke\u2019s first law reigns supreme, where any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Our heroine is Cassandra Price, a brilliant mess of a human being eking out an existence at a megacorporation that her father\u2019s work helped elevate into one of the most lucrative companies in the world.\n\nShe is a \u201ccode janitor,\u201d a woman who deals in digital trash, desperately working to preserve the mediocre health care coverage that allows her father to stay alive despite the futuristic disease that has consigned him to a coma. \u201cA lot of people need technology to survive,\u201d says Quinn. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re renting it and you don\u2019t own it or have control over it, you\u2019re at the mercy of whoever does.\u201d\n\nAll of that said, this is not a dystopia. \u201cI don\u2019t want to tell a story about how technological advancement is bad,\u201d says Quinn. \u201cI\u2019m so tired of cyberpunk that says using machines to make your life better makes you less human. I think using technology to make your life better is probably the most human thing. We are the species that does that. To pretend that it is completely divorced from humanity is asinine to me, not least of all because of the collateral damage to disabled people.\u201d\n\nTech is neither good nor bad in Goddess Mode: it simply is. It helps, it hurts, it exists in ways that accurately reflect the conflicted reality of systems and platforms and capitalism that we deal with in our own reality. \u201cThe story is really about how most things aren\u2019t really inherently bad or good,\u201d says Quinn. \u201cIt all depends on what we do with them. Whether it\u2019s technology, having magic powers, having information \u2014 you can\u2019t easily condense something into a binary, which is one of the reasons I\u2019m using so many tech metaphors.\u201d It is rendered, by Robbi Rodriguez and colorist Rico Renzi, in the fierce, retrofuturistic extremes of color and angle that defined the internet at its inception.\n\nPsyche, the ubiquitous AI that Cassandra\u2019s father created, is widely deployed as a day-to-day task manager \u2014 somewhere between Siri and Google \u2014 for the public at large. Psyche is always learning, but the most important lessons she learned were from a man who was singularly committed to ensuring that she learned the right ones. \u201cCassandra\u2019s father was basically raising two girls at once,\u201d says Quinn. \u201cHer and the AI. He was working to humanize the machine and make it learn the right things from humans instead of the wrong things.\u201d\n\nThis is no small task. If there is anything to take away from the extraordinarily problematic world of algorithmic decision-making, it is how easily and gratefully we turn over our moral responsibilities to machines that we believe are more objective by merit of them trafficking in ones and zeros. We exist in a world where predictive policing, predictive sentencing, predictive loans, and facial recognition have become the law of the land, without a moment of pause for the fact that all the data we feed into these systems and the programs we create to process them are as imperfect and biased as any other systems we could generate \u2014 regardless of the math.\n\n\u201cEverybody wants to think that if math did it, it\u2019s perfect,\u201d says Quinn. \u201cBut people are behind these algorithms and the data that\u2019s being fed into them. So much of what we see and hear, consider to be true, is dictated by algorithms that elevate what they think is the most important or valid to the forefront. And I think a lot of people don\u2019t realize exactly how easily that can be manipulated\u2026 It always makes me super nervous how many tech companies don\u2019t have data ethicists.\u201d\n\nAlchemical symbols abound in Goddess Mode, woven inextricably into code. Something is happening beneath the surface, something arcane and verging on the magical. The series invokes a trope that has rarely been combined with tech: magical girls. What if Sailor Moon lived inside the internet? Goddess Mode wants to know.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been obsessed with magical girls forever,\u201d says Quinn. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time I saw queer girls in anything.\u201d If you are unfamiliar with the trope, it goes a little bit like this: a young woman discovers a sort of power that she did not know she had, and she transforms, through an elaborate and elegant sequence into a sort of superheroine.\n\nQuinn has a particular love of Sailor Moon, whose protagonist, Usagi, is best known for crying, whining, being late, and falling down a lot. She also saves the entire world from dangers it would be incapable of defending against and entirely unprepared to comprehend. Sailor Moon is supported by a group of other young women who must contend with similarly complicated but challenging notions of power and responsibility. This is a story about finding a way to exist in a world that is hostile to you, partly, if not largely, through the support of your friends.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good allegory for what it\u2019s like to end up connected to a bunch of people who are relative strangers, but who are dealing with the same crap as you that a lot of other people don\u2019t understand, or don\u2019t think is even really happening,\u201d says Quinn. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to fight to make the world better, but it\u2019s like trying to fix a car that\u2019s crashing into you. I feel like magical girls are a really good allegory for that.\u201d\u2019\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re trying to fight to make the world better, but it\u2019s like trying to fix a car that\u2019s crashing into you.\u201d\n\nSo are their powers based on technology, or magic? \u201cYes,\u201d answers Quinn. \u201cI mean, does it matter? At the end of the day it\u2019s power. One of the reasons I\u2019m leaning so heavily into alchemy iconography and language is I really like the hermetic aspects that are kind of like scientific magic.\u201d\n\nCassandra is a magician, a heroine, a tech genius, and a completely exhausted individual in a world that seems designed to work against her. She finds a way to become something better anyway, not because it\u2019s easy, but because it is the only way out of the economic, political, and technological system that has wound its tendrils around her to the point of choking \u2014 something Quinn describes as a \u201cgnarly rat king tangle of pain.\u201d Goddess Mode is an answer written in neon and transformation sequences. \u201cThis is how you fight back,\u201d says one character as she confronts a digital foe at a critical moment.\n\nI ask Quinn what the elevator pitch is for Goddess Mode, shortly before our interview ends: \u201cIf you\u2019re tired and exhausted and trying to fight for anything, really, and you just want to be encouraged to keep going, then this is me trying to subtweet you in a comic. Also, it\u2019s real gay.\u201d", "description": "In the words of its writer, Hugo Award nominee Zoe Quinn, the Vertigo comic book Goddess Mode is a \"weird neon baby of cyberpunk and magical girls,\" a world where Arthur C.
