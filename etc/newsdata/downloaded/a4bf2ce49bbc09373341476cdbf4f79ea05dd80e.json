What's his name?\u201d\n\n\u201cRam\u00f3n,\u201d she said, pronouncing the name \u201cWah-mone.\u201d\n\nJOSHUA ROGERS: MY WIFE AND I MADE A BIG MISTAKE \u2014 AND LEARNED A PRICELESS LESSON FROM IT\n\n\u201cCan I meet him?\u201d I asked.\n\nShe looked away for a moment, then looked back at me and said, \u201cHe\u2019s using the bathroom.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see,\u201d and thus began my relationship with my imaginary son-in-law. In the week after he married my daughter, he mowed the backyard, took a job \u201cwriting papers,\u201d cared for my imaginary grandkids, and got sick with an \u201cear confection\u201d (those ear confections are the worst!).\n\nMy daughter is now 8 and, assuming she gets married, Ram\u00f3n is likely out there somewhere. When he finally shows up, there are some things I'd like to say to him. I'll go ahead and start with this:\n\nDear Ram\u00f3n,\n\nSo you\u2019re the one -- the man who\u2019s going to marry my daughter. Wow. I never thought this day would come.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong: I wanted it to come; it\u2019s just that her mom and I have spent so many years loving her, praying for her and getting to know her. Now she\u2019s yours \u201cto have and to hold\" and I want you to do that well. That's why you need to understand that loving my daughter will require you to care for her in many of the ways she needed back when she pretend-married you at age 3. That's going to start with playing together.\n\nMy daughter would play all day if she could, and she\u2019s still going to need playtime with you when she grows up. You can\u2019t maintain a good friendship with someone you can\u2019t have fun with, and if you don\u2019t have a good friendship, things like intimacy and deep conversation will eventually become a relic of days gone by. So remember to have fun with her, Ram\u00f3n -- it\u2019s one of the most effective ways you can keep things fresh in your relationship.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nAnother thing: Please don\u2019t ever stop adoring her. Man, you have no idea how many times a week she comes into the living room and says, \u201cWatch me, Daddy!\u201d Then she does a dance, a new gymnastics move, or shows me her pretty outfit. At the heart of her request for attention is the same desire: She wants me to stop and behold her. So I do. I tell her that she\u2019s beautiful, smart and strong; and it means everything to her. One day, it will mean everything to her when you do the beholding -- don\u2019t forget to do that, Ram\u00f3n.\n\nOne last thing: I hope you\u2019ll pray with her frequently. I know a lot of men who find it awkward to pray with their wives -- it's going to be a lot easier for you. My daughter and her sister pray with me every night and it sparks some profound conversations about who God is, how He answers prayers and what He's trying to tell us through Scripture. She\u2019s still going to need that kind of spiritual engagement when she\u2019s your wife. Don\u2019t be weird about it -- just do it. You\u2019ll be drawing closer to her and Jesus, and nothing can make your marriage stronger than that.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nI could give you some more advice but I don\u2019t want to overwhelm you. I just want you to remember that although you\u2019re marrying a grown woman, being a good husband will require you to love her even more than I do now -- and that's saying a lot.\n\nLove,\n\nYour future father-in-law\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JOSHUA ROGERS", "description": "One morning when my youngest daughter was 3, she got out of bed, met me at the stairs, and\u00a0with quiet sincerity\u00a0said, \u201cDaddy, I have a husband.\u201d", "authors": ["Joshua Rogers", "Joshua Rogers Is The Author Of The Forthcoming Book"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/10/11/694940094001_5847188569001_5847177746001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
