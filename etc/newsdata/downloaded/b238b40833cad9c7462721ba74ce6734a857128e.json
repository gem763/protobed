I needed to know about the coach\u2019s personality, habits and his football philosophy,\u201d said Hong, who once did a stint as a tour guide.\n\nLanguage skill is one thing, Hong said, but you also need to know football jargon and have an intricate understanding of the game.\n\nBeing a \u201cbridge\u201d is not always a comfortable place to be, especially when feelings are running high in the changing room at half-time or after a defeat.\n\nHong said he sometimes uses his own discretion to water down some of Stojkovic\u2019s more scathing remarks.\n\n\u201cEveryone understands that only when you really love the team, you will have such a strong emotion,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn that case, I won\u2019t translate the sharp words otherwise it will fuel the fire.\n\n\u201cHowever, I will convey the coach\u2019s attitude to the team in another way.\u201d\n\nIt can also mean saving coaches from themselves, especially in China, where football authorities hand out harsh punishments for criticism of referees.\n\nInterpreters sometimes purposely omit comments by coaches in press conferences to head off trouble with the Chinese Football Association.\n\n\u2013 Memories of tragic Tiote \u2013\n\nSergi Barjuan\u2019s family remained in Spain while he coached Zhejiang Greentown \u2014 one reason why he called his interpreter his \u201cwife\u201d. He left the post in July after 20 months.\n\nInterpreters also play an important part in the daily lives of foreign players and coaches, for whom China can be a culture shock.\n\nThey help new arrivals find a place to live, open bank accounts and help set up mobile payment systems on their smart phones.\n\nEven after they get settled into life in China, foreign coaches or players lean heavily on interpreters, even taking them supermarket shopping.\n\nThey can become close friends and confidants.\n\nThat was the case for Zhao Chen, who worked at Beijing Enterprises FC and helped Cheick Tiote, the midfielder who died in 2017 after collapsing in training with the club.\n\nThe Ivory Coast international\u2019s death aged 30 shocked the football world.\n\nThe 28-year-old Zhao, now an interpreter at Shijiazhuang Ever Bright in China\u2019s second tier, has fond memories of getting Tiote settled in, including finding him a place to worship.\n\n\u201cAs a foreign Muslim, it\u2019s not easy to find a mosque for their jumah (Friday prayers),\u201d said Zhao.\n\n\u201cI would check it first and always went there with him together.\n\n\u201cUntil now I still miss him so much.\u201d", "description": "Shanghai (AFP) \u2013 Rafa Benitez says his Chinese-language interpreter is always by his side and former Barcelona defender Sergi Barjuan joked that his", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/8e896b_dragan-stojkovic-head-coach-guangzhou-relies-heavily-on-his-translator-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
