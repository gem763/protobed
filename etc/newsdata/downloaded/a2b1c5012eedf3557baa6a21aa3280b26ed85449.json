His father, Tim Dunn, said they needed to get the truth.\n\nMs Charles added: \"We are not out to get her put behind bars. If that's what the justice system ends up doing then we can't stop that but we're not out to do that, we're out to try and get some peace for ourselves.\"\n\nThe US Embassy previously said \"security and privacy considerations\" precluded it from naming the suspect.\n\nImage copyright Family photo Image caption The teenager, from Charlton, Banbury, died in hospital after his motorbike crashed with a Volvo\n\nOn Saturday the US State Department said diplomatic immunity was \"rarely waived\" but Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab urged the US Embassy to reconsider.\n\nUnder the 1961 Vienna Convention, diplomats and their family members are immune from prosecution in their host country, so long as they are not nationals of that country. However, their immunity can be waived by the state that has sent them.\n\nMr Adderley was asked on Twitter whether Ms Sacoolas was lawfully entitled to claim diplomatic immunity.\n\nHe replied: \"The short answer is yes,\" adding that both he and Northamptonshire Police and Crime Commissioner Stephen Mold had written to the US Embassy, urging that the waiver be applied \"in order to allow the justice process to take place\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The crash happened on the B4031 near RAF Croughton, Northamptonshire\n\nThe US State Department said on Saturday that the incident involved \"a vehicle driven by the spouse of a US diplomat assigned to the United Kingdom\".\n\nPolice said the suspect had \"engaged fully\" following the crash near RAF Croughton, a US Air Force communications station, and said \"she had no plans to leave the country in the near future\".\n\nThe US State Department has said it is in \"close consultation\" with British officials and has offered its \"deepest sympathies\" to the family of Mr Dunn.\n\n\"Any questions regarding a waiver of immunity with regard to our diplomats and their family members overseas in a case like this receive intense attention at senior levels and are considered carefully given the global impact such decisions carry; immunity is rarely waived,\" it added.", "description": "A diplomat's wife involved in a crash which killed 19-year-old Harry Dunn is named as Anne Sacoolas.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07q9glz.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
