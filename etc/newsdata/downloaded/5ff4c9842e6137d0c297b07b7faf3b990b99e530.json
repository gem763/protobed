It\u2019s the sort of language people think legitimises a more aggressive approach and sometimes violence.\u201d\n\nComparing Johnson\u2019s approach to that of Donald Trump during the 2016 US presidential election, Rudd said \u201cthe casual approach to safety of MPs and their staff [was] immoral\u201d, and urged ministers to \u201cconsider their own judgments rather than be desperately loyal\u201d.\n\nRudd\u2019s departure from the government and party followed the purging of 21 Tory colleagues who voted to allow more parliamentary time to pass a bill seeking to block a no-deal Brexit.\n\nLanguage in Brexit debate unacceptable, say C of E bishops Read more\n\nRudd told the Standard she wanted to \u201cstay and fight\u201d for the one-nation style of Conservatism associated with David Cameron, but did not confirm where that may be. The former home secretary won her current seat of Hastings with a majority of just 346 over Labour in the 2017 general election.\n\n\u201cThe most likely place for me to stand, if I need to stand as an independent Conservative, would be somewhere with a strong remain constituency, so I am looking around,\u201d she said.\n\nAmong mooted constituencies could be Kensington, very narrowly held by Labour\u2019s Emma Dent Coad, or Chelsea and Fulham, where the MP is Johnson-loyalist Greg Hands.\n\nHowever, a Conservative source said that under Electoral Commission rules none of the purged MPs could stand as \u201cindependent Conservatives\u201d, only as independents.", "description": "Former minister was \u2018disappointed and stunned\u2019 by Boris Johnson\u2019s comments about Jo Cox", "authors": ["Peter Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/596c27629cc5f5dd68c164d5738aa0c65d2be017/197_0_4262_2558/master/4262.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f74ed67c6c82f03f0bae9815c33d4767", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
