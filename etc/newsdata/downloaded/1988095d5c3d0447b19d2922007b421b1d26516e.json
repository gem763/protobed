Yep, Jesus wept.\n\nProject manager Kenna brought back his fellow team members Dean Ahmad and Ryan-Mark Parsons back to face Lord Sugar, Claude Littner and Karren Brady, but it was his head that was on the chopping block.\n\nAs he made his final decision, Lord Sugar said: \u2018Dean I\u2019m sorry my friend but it is unforgivable that you\u2019ve lost the potential of \u00a3300 worth of profit for this task. Unforgivable.\n\n\u2018But you know what, I wonder whether it wasn\u2019t you that screwed it up.\n\nKenna reckons Dean should\u2019ve been sent packing (Picture: BBC)\n\n\u2018Kenna, he [Dean] came back with a potential order for \u00a3400 and you as the manager should have gone, \u201cBingo, I\u2019m going to make sure we produce this bespoke product\u201d and you didn\u2019t.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018And for that reason Kenna, you\u2019re fired.\u2019\n\nSpeaking exclusively to Metro.co.uk, Kenna told us that he thought Lord Sugar\u2019s ruling was incorrect.\n\n\u2018I think Dean should have gone,\u2019 he said. \u2018From my point of view, all he had to do was make sure what the costs were.\n\n\u2018We made exactly what he said we should make and then it was for him to shake hands or finalise a pre-agreed deal.\n\n\u2018The fact that he got nothing is absolutely criminal.\u2019\n\nLuckily though, Kenna and Dean are on good terms and there is no bad blood between them.\n\n\u2018We got on outside of recording,\u2019 he added. \u2018It wasn\u2019t anything personal. It was nothing malicious against him, he just had to go.\u2019\n\nThe Apprentice continues Wednesday at 9pm on BBC One.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
