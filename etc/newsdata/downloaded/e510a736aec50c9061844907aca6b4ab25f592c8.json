I am thinking about the online frontier. These are the competition going forward.\n\n\"We need to agree a system for everyone to grow from within and not exclude anyone just because of a birth defect of coming from a small country.\"\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nAgnelli favours a pyramid model which offers a greater number of group stage matches in European competition and also allows a certain number of clubs to qualify for the following season's Champions League based on continental performance, rather than via the traditional domestic route.\n\nHe cited the example of Dutch club Ajax, who despite reaching the semi-finals last season had to go through the preliminary rounds to reach the group phase.\n\n\"It's right that if you perform in the international system, you stay in the international system,\" he said at the Leaders Sports Business Summit in London.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\"It would be great for clubs like Ajax, Celtic, (Legia) Warsaw knowing they can stay in Europe and not have to qualify via domestic system.\"\n\nThe pyramid proposals have been criticised by the domestic leagues, who are vehemently opposed to the idea of qualification via their competitions being reduced or the prospect of European games being played at the weekend.\n\nAgnelli said he was open to listening to constructive feedback but did not believe the leagues had offered that as yet.\n\n\"We are not in politics - we do not have a government and an opposition, we are all on the same side,\" he said.\n\n\"If we don't think about a progressive system we are simply protecting a system which is no longer there.\n\n\"We are protecting a system made only of domestic games that will have little interest from our kids.\"", "description": "Andrea Agnelli, the Juventus president, has claimed that football can learn from the success of esports and Fortnite", "authors": ["Neil Mcleman", "Image", "Reuters", "Afp Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article18919861.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Fortnite-streamer-Ninja-disgusted-after-dormant-Twitch-channel-promotes-porn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
