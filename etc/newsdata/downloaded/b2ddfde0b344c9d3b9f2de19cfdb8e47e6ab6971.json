Earlier this month a Saudi-led coalition launched airstrikes on a Houthi detention center, leaving at least 100 dead and dozens more injured. It was the Saudi side\u2019s deadliest attack so far this year, according to the Yemen Data Project.\n\nThe state-run Saudi Press Agency was first to report the call between American and Saudi leadership.\n\n\u201cViolent actions against civilian areas and infrastructure vital to the global economy only deepen conflict and mistrust,\u201d the White House said in a statement. \u201cThe United States Government is monitoring the situation and remains committed to ensuring global oil markets are stable and well supplied.\u201d\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo pinned the Houthi drone strikes directly on Iran, currently at odds with the U.S. as a nuclear arms deal reached by the Obama administration has steadily unraveled in the Trump era.\n\nIn a pair of tweets, Pompeo called on the international community \u201cto publicly and unequivocally condemn Iran\u2019s attacks\u201d while hinting at possible consequences for Tehran.\n\nTehran is behind nearly 100 attacks on Saudi Arabia while Rouhani and Zarif pretend to engage in diplomacy. Amid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world\u2019s energy supply. There is no evidence the attacks came from Yemen. \u2014 Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) September 14, 2019\n\nWe call on all nations to publicly and unequivocally condemn Iran\u2019s attacks. The United States will work with our partners and allies to ensure that energy markets remain well supplied and Iran is held accountable for its aggression \u2014 Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) September 14, 2019\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether the drone strikes led to any injuries or deaths at the two oil fields. Seeking to assure global markets, Saudi officials told The Wall Street Journal that the facilities would return to normal production levels Monday.\n\nThe International Energy Agency, which represents top energy-consuming nations, said it was monitoring the situation closely.\n\nThe deadly conflict has sparked one of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crises. In Yemen \u2015 the Arab world\u2019s poorest country \u2015 10 million people are \u201cone step away from famine,\u201d the United Nations announced earlier this year.\n\nNearly 100,000 have died since a Saudi-led coalition began battling the Houthi rebels in early 2015, months after Houthis seized the Yemeni capital of Sanaa.\n\nTrump has faced strong criticism at home for his chummy relationship with the Saudi Crown Prince \u2015 who is accused of human rights abuses including the brutal 2018 murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nThe call to the Crown Price, commonly referred to by his initials, MBS, came just a few days after the U.S. said it would release the name of a Saudi national involved in carrying out the 9/11 terrorist attacks to families of the victims.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nSaudi-Led Airstrikes On Yemen Prison Kill At Least 100, Injure Dozens More\n\nIran Inching Closer To A Nuclear Weapon After U.S. Violated Deal\n\nDrone Attacks Spark Huge Fires At Saudi Arabia Oil Facilities\n\nLove HuffPost?
