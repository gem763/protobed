(Photo: Guillermo Arias/AFP via Getty Images) More\n\nDuring a now infamous press briefing last week, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney attempted to make the case that the White House\u2019s decision to withhold military funds from Ukraine was neither improper nor any different from the Trump administration\u2019s ordinary negotiations with foreign governments.\n\nMulvaney has since tried to walk back comments that seemed to acknowledge a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d offer to release the aid in exchange for Ukrainian government help in publicizing a conspiracy theory that Trump and his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, have been promoting about the 2016 election.\n\nBut Mulvaney also confirmed that the administration is in the habit of using foreign aid to coerce compliance with U.S. policy. \u201cWe do that all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were holding up money at the same time for, what was it, the Northern Triangle countries. We were holding up aid at the Northern Triangle countries [Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador] so that they would change their policies on immigration.\u201d\n\nOther presidents have done the same, although Stephen McFarland, the former U.S. ambassador to Guatemala and a 37-year veteran of the U.S. Foreign Service, described the Trump administration as exceptionally \u201ctransactional\u201d and \u201cshort-sighted.\u201d\n\nMore important, in McFarland\u2019s view, is that the concessions sought from Ukraine weren\u2019t to advance U.S. foreign policy goals, but Trump\u2019s personal interest in disputing Russian help with his election and discrediting former Vice President Joe Biden. The administration has consistently cast the issue as one of combating \u201ccorruption,\u201d but the specific assistance it sought dovetails with Trump\u2019s political agenda.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, Mulvaney was conflating regular diplomacy, where you engage in combination of persuasion, cajoling, sometimes pressure to advance United States security objectives, with doing the same stuff to advance the president\u2019s reelection,\u201d said McFarland. \u201cThat\u2019s the difference, and it\u2019s a big difference.\u201d\n\nUnlike what Trump and his allies appear to have been pushing for in Ukraine, McFarland continued, the migration agreements forged by the Trump administration in Central America constitute a legitimate foreign policy matter, \u201cno matter how much you disagree with them.\u201d\n\nActing White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney.

The policy has been criticized by human rights advocates and regional experts, including McFarland, who doubts that the three nations, whose own citizens make up the majority of the asylum seekers already, have the resources to provide security and shelter to tens of thousands of additional migrants, especially those fleeing gang violence just over the border.\n\nNot only are the agreements themselves flawed, but McFarland and others argue that some of the tactics used to secure them \u2014 including the withholding of aid cited by Mulvaney \u2014 reflect a serious disregard for regional conditions, and a disregard of long-term U.S. interests in exchange for immediate gains.", "description": "In an infamous press briefing last week, White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney confirmed that the Trump administration is in the habit of using foreign aid to coerce compliance with U.S. policy.
