The democracy movement has more demands, and reasons to believe they won\u2019t be met. And Congress can still protect its ally and American interests by passing bipartisan draft legislation that\u2019ll \u201cgive lawmakers the ability to sanction Chinese and Hong Kong officials who commit human rights abuses and undermine the territory's autonomy\u201d when it\u2019s debated next week.\n\nThe protesters are demanding Lam\u2019s resignation, an independent investigation of police brutality, universal suffrage, and amnesty for arrested protesters. Lam, of course, rejected most of these demands. Protesters are also worried that the extradition bill\u2019s withdrawal, which doesn\u2019t prevent it from being put forward in the future, is only a temporary setback for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) regime and its supporters in the Hong Kong government, who are likely to continue eroding the territory\u2019s autonomy guaranteed by the 1997 bilateral agreement that transferred it to mainland China under the \u2018one party, two systems\u2019 policy.\n\nThe implications of this ongoing encroachment on Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy for American economic and national interests can\u2019t be ignored.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s open markets, low-taxing economy, apolitical and independent judiciary, rule of law, respect for property rights and commitment to liberal values have made it a Mecca of economic prosperity, foreign investment and strong civil society in the Asia-Pacific.\n\nAmericans have benefited greatly from this. In 2017, American investment in the territory totaled over $81 billion, a 17.2% increase over the previous year. Despite its small size, Hong Kong is the United States\u2019 tenth-largest export market and twenty-second largest goods trading partner. American expatriate workers also benefit from the skills and experience that they eventually bring home from Hong Kong due to its status as an international finance and technology hub.\n\nBut much of this could be under threat. Hong Kong\u2019s apolitical and independent judiciary and respect for property rights has long offered certainty to businesses, workers and investors that they won\u2019t become targets of a political power play by the one-party communist mainland administration. This stands in stark contrast to mainland China, where the Chief Justice of the country\u2019s Supreme Court openly dismisses judicial independence as an \u201cerroneous\u201d western influence.\n\nAustralia has learned this lesson already. Chinese-Australian writer and pro-democracy activist Dr. Yang Hengjun is currently detained in China on trumped-up allegations of espionage, having been denied access to his family or lawyers. Just a decade ago, another Australian national and businessman, Stern Hu, was sentenced to 10 years\u2019 imprisonment for bribery and industrial espionage after a closed trial that Australian consular officials were denied access to.\n\nAnd the CCP\u2019s record of torturing and killing dissidents, harvesting their organs, and putting minorities in concentration camps makes this prospect doubly concerning. As does the CCP\u2019s planned expansion of its citizen surveillance and behavioral engineering social credit system to companies \u2014 a move that will impact over 33 million businesses. Although Americans doing business on the mainland already face these risks, those conducting business in liberal and autonomous Hong Kong have hitherto remained safe.\n\nAmerican entrepreneurs and investors would also be worried by the erosion of Hong Kong\u2019s strong intellectual property rights protections. U.S. companies doing business in mainland China are routinely forced to hand over Intellectual Property and trade secrets to the Chinese Communist Party government as a condition of entry into the Chinese market. These are often appropriated and exploited.\n\nThat\u2019s why an international coalition of 46 pro-market advocacy groups from over 27 nations, spearheaded by the Australian Taxpayers\u2019 Alliance, have issued an open letter urging world leaders to continue pressuring the CCP regime, and urging the U.S. Congress, the world\u2019s most influential national government, to pass the aforementioned Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019. Importantly, the act not only allows for sanctions on dubious Hong Kong or CCP officials but also requires an annual review of Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy upon which the territory\u2019s special status as a trading partner is contingent.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of international pressure that the CCP regime is afraid of. They\u2019ve said as much in their press statements. And it could mark the start of sanctions to come from China\u2019s other trading partners that will ensure that the regime is held to account, should it exceed its mandate going forward.\n\nPassing this legislation, which already has Nancy Pelosi\u2019s support, will be a rare example of bipartisanship in an increasingly polarized and fraught political climate. It\u2019ll also protect U.S. interests while enabling Hong Kongers to maintain their autonomy and everything that has made their society prosperous. That\u2019s nothing but a win.\n\nSatya Marar is the Director of Policy at the Australian Taxpayers\u2019 Alliance and a Young Voices Contributor.", "description": "By Satya Marar\u00a0Although pro-Beijing Hong Kong Premier Carrie Lam formally .09/26/2019 12:35:34PM EST.", "authors": ["Young Voices Advocates", "Matt Vespa", "Guy Benson", "Cortney O'Brien", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/251/38a1ad18-1481-4d73-943e-49664ee7d766.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
