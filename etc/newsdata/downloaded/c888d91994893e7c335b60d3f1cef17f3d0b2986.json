And it\u2019s a problem that spells serious trouble for the dozens of Democratic candidates running for president.\n\nJosh Fox is the self-proclaimed leader of a \u201cgrassroots\u201d movement to \u201creclaim our country\u201d and has been acclaimed by Hollywood elites for years. He has won an Emmy, been nominated for an Oscar and three of his documentaries have been broadcast on HBO. These documentaries included two \u201cGasland\u201d anti-fracking films and a climate apocalypse movie.\n\nIf you believe Josh Fox and the media, these films are important and timely, reflecting grassroots concerns. But Josh Fox has very publicly discovered that the grassroots really don\u2019t want to follow him or his ideas.\n\nIn July, Fox launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund a \u201cgrassroots\u201d film tour of his movie, \u201cTHE TRUTH HAS CHANGED\u201d (unnecessary capitalization his). He hopes the project will screen in over 100 cities in 2019 and 2020. The film is based upon Fox\u2019s book of the same name, which argues that we are facing an existential \u201cclimate crisis\u201d which is being covered up by evil liars (myself included). His Kickstarter page proclaims that \u201che\u2019s going on the road to defeat Trump, organize for the climate, and support grassroots groups who fight for progressive values.\u201d\n\nJust how he squares going on the road to 100 cities with his pledge to \u201csave the climate\u201d is not explained. Maybe Fox has some mysterious way of traveling to 100 cities that does not involve air travel and burning of large quantities of fossil fuels. Or maybe Fox doesn\u2019t really believe in climate change and is using fear to push his anti-American, anti-business and anti-modernity agenda. Or maybe like so many Hollywood elites Josh Fox believes that climate change restrictions are for the little people. He is important and has important work to do. Others need to ditch their cars or not fly and be penalized if they continue to do so. He\u2019s certainly not alone in this mentality. Earlier this month, Google had a climate change summit in Italy. Collectively, the A-listers, reportedly including former President Barack Obama and Prince Harry, arrived by way of 114 private planes. Talk about a large carbon footprint.\n\nBut all these hypocrisies may be irrelevant. The grassroots is failing to support Fox\u2019s crowdfunding campaign. It looks like Fox might have to ponder the meaning of truth and the climate from his apartment in Brooklyn and not the 100 cities as planned.\n\nIn the nearly 40 days since the project launched, it has barely reached 25% of its $100,000 goal. As of this writing, Fox has raised just $25k from 277 backers.\n\nI\u2019ve done quite a few crowdfunding campaigns myself and you can always rely on your family, friends and coworkers to chip in. But when you strip away those people from Josh Fox\u2019s \u201cgrassroots,\u201d it\u2019s clear he actually has almost no grassroots support. In his Kickstarter campaign he claims he\u2019s \u201cleading a movement\u201d and will shift paradigms and \u201cdefeat Donald Trump.\u201d But it seems to be a movement without any movers. Fox\u2019s support is even more pathetic when you take into account that he had a mysterious donor throw in a matching 4k. Fox suddenly received another big donation to allow the matching to kick in. Strip out this fake 8k and Fox seems to be the leader of a movement that cant even energize his own friends. This should be alarming for Fox but also for the Democratic candidates running for president on a climate alarmism platform. If Fox can\u2019t even get his friends to support him what hope have they of attracting millions nationally.\n\nThe filmmaker seems to be in denial about his lack of popular support. He has been sending \u201cComical Ali in Iraq\u201d style emails boasting about the success of the campaign despite a publicly available miserable tally for two months of furious fundraising. And just like Comical Ali a tenuous relationship with the truth is not new for Josh Fox, whose anti-fracking documentary Gasland is full of unethical journalism and straightforward untruths. I helped debunk the film\u2019s much publicized claim that fracking was responsible for some faucet water becoming \u201cflammable.\u201d When I questioned him about it, he admitted to omitting inconvenient facts because they were \u201cnot relevant\u201d. No wonder so few individuals want to invest in Fox\u2019s work.\n\nPhelim McAleer is the co-host of The Ann And Phelim Scoop podcast, available weekly every Wednesday on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and other podcasting platforms.
