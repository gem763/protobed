This is a unique situation.\"\n\nHe also expressed open disagreement with Trump\u2019s criticisms of the whistleblower as a partisan hack and a traitor.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Maguire said when Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) asked him if he believed the whistleblower was loyal to another country. \u201cI think the whistleblower did the right thing.\u201d\n\nDemocrats sought to use the hearing as a catalyst for Trmp\u2019s impeachment, two days after Speaker Nancy Pelosi embraced formal impeachment proceedings. The whistleblower complaint, which was made public just minutes before the hearing, alleges that Trump abused his office when he pressured Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and that White House officials sought to cover it up.\n\n\u201cIt would be funny, if it weren\u2019t such a graphic betrayal of the president\u2019s oath of office,\u201d Schiff said.\n\n\u201cBut as it does represent a real betrayal \u2014 there is nothing the president says here that is in America\u2019s interest \u2014 it is instead the most consequential form of tragedy, for it forces us to confront the remedy the founders provided for such a flagrant abuse of office, impeachment,\u201d he added.\n\nMaguire revealed that he first asked White House lawyers about the complaint because it involved presidential conversations with a foreign leader, which are typically subject to executive privilege. He said it \u201cseemed prudent,\u201d as a member of the executive branch, to discuss the matter with other agencies.\n\nHe then consulted with the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel, which determined that the complaint did not meet the legal definition of \u201curgent\u201d because Trump is not an employee of the intelligence community and therefore falls outside of his jurisdiction.\n\nMichael Atkinson, the intelligence community's inspector general, disagreed with that determination and later informed the House Intelligence Committee of the complaint\u2019s existence.\n\n\u201cIt was urgent and important,\u201d Maguire said. \u201cBut my job as the DNI was to comply with the Whistleblower Protection Act and adhere to the definition of urgent concern, which is a legal term.\u201d\n\nMaguire sat on the complaint even though Atkinson, a Trump-appointed internal watchdog, deemed it \u201curgent\u201d and credible. The watchdog even referred it to the Justice Department to examine whether campaign finance laws were broken. Now, Democrats are expediting consideration of articles of impeachment against Trump, citing evidence that he solicited foreign interference in the 2020 election.\n\nThe complaint alleges that White House officials were \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by Trump\u2019s phone call with Zelensky. It also stated that officials were already talking with White House lawyers because of the \u201clikelihood \u2026 that they had witnessed the president abuse his office for personal gain.\u201d\n\nThe complaint also says White House officials tried to \u201clock down\u201d records of the phone call, and that the transcript was \u201cloaded into a separate electronic system that is otherwise used to store and handle classified information of an especially sensitive nature.\u201d\n\nMaguire repeatedly refused to say whether he had spoken directly to Trump about the whistleblower complaint.\n\nUnder questioning from Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), Maguire said he couldn't discuss his conversations with Trump. \u201cMy conversations with the president, because I\u2019m the director of national intelligence, are privileged,\u201d he said.\n\nNew Window How to read Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president: A line-by-line analysis of the conversation that launched an impeachment inquiry.\n\nMaguire also said the White House never advised him to not provide the whistleblower complaint to Congress.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump sought to preempt the hearing by releasing notes of a July 25 call with Zelesnky \u2014 which came just days after the White House blocked military aid marked for Ukraine \u2014 in which he repeatedly asked for a \u201cfavor.\u201d During the 30-minute call, Trump asked Zelensky to both examine unfounded conspiracy theories about Ukraine\u2019s role in the 2016 election as well as to investigate Biden.\n\nThe release of the call notes seemed to compound Trump\u2019s woes, however, emboldening Democrats to charge more quickly toward a possible impeachment.\n\nMaguire\u2019s appearance before the Intelligence Committee marked House Democrats\u2019 first high-profile hearing since Speaker Nancy Pelosi embraced formal impeachment proceedings earlier this week, as Democrats united in outrage over Trump\u2019s conversation with Zelensky. Many now expect Trump\u2019s actions toward Ukraine to form the core of articles of impeachment that could come to the House floor before the end of the year.\n\nThe panel received an unclassified version of the whistleblower complaint late Wednesday but has yet to view a report on the fuller investigation conducted by Atkinson, the inspector general.\n\nAtkinson met with lawmakers behind closed doors last week but was unable to discuss the substance of the complaint because Maguire had not authorized him to do so.\n\nAhead of the hearing, Democratic members of the committee were pushing for a confrontational approach with Maguire, citing his initial refusal to turn over the whistleblower complaint and his deference to the Justice Department.\n\nSome lawmakers were already pushing for Maguire to be held in contempt of Congress if he is evasive when he appears before the panel. But Schiff wouldn\u2019t commit to punitive measures this week.\n\n\u201cWe expect him to comply with the law, and if he doesn\u2019t, we\u2019ll figure out what the repercussions should be,\u201d Schiff told POLITICO.\n\nThree House committees that have already been investigating Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani could issue subpoenas as early as Thursday if the State Department does not turn over documents related to Giuliani\u2019s alleged efforts to recruit the Ukrainian government\u2019s help in launching an investigation targeting Biden and his son.\n\nTogether, both Maguire\u2019s hearing and the State Department\u2019s refusal to turn over those documents could prompt even more House Democrats to endorse the impeachment inquiry. At least 219 lawmakers already support it.\n\nSchiff has also indicated he is consulting with the House general counsel about how to convey any classified details that might be relevant to impeachment to his colleagues and possibly the public. It\u2019s unclear whether the transmission of the unclassified complaint will be sufficient and Democrats said they must see Atkinson\u2019s report as well, which they say contains the names of corroborating witnesses who confirmed the whistleblower\u2019s account.\n\n", "description": "Democrats seized on the whistleblower complaint about Trump's Ukraine call to advance their impeachment drive.", "authors": ["Andrew Desiderio", "Kyle Cheney"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/3d/90/378739dc4858a6c980814351c351/190926-joseph-maguire-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
