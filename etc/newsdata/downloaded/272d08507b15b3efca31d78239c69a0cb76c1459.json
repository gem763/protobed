Here's what doctors recommend you pack in your overnight bag", "language": "en", "text": "Going into hospital can be a bit like visiting another country, says Zoe Andrews, a matron for surgery at the Benenden Hospital in Kent.\n\n\u2018The new routine and environment can feel alien and the language used is unfamiliar, so, just as when you go on any other trip, it\u2019s important to plan.\u2019\n\nThat starts with what you wear. You might assume pyjamas would be at the top of your packing list, but, while you\u2019ll want them at night, evidence suggests wearing other comfortable clothes, such as a T-shirt and jogging bottoms, during the day can speed up your recovery, says Ian Currie, a consultant gynaecologist at BMI The Chiltern Hospital in Buckinghamshire.\n\n\u2018People generally feel healthier and more resilient in their normal clothes, while wearing pyjamas or hospital gowns 24/7 reminds them they are a patient, which can slow recovery.\u2019\n\nBut what else should be in your bag? We asked the experts for their tips.\n\nEvidence suggests wearing comfortable clothes, such as a T-shirt and jogging bottoms, during the day can speed up your recovery (stock image)\n\nCALMING MUSIC\n\nTry: Sony headphones, \u00a349.99, robertdyas.co.uk\n\nPre-operative anxiety can raise stress hormone levels in the body. \u2018This, in turn, can slow your recovery,\u2019 says Dr Currie. \u2018We know music calms anxiety, so download soothing tunes to listen to before you\u2019re taken to theatre.\u2019\n\nHe adds: \u2018A recent study by the University of Pennsylvania, in the U.S., found that listening to music reduced patients\u2019 anxiety levels as successfully as taking midazolam \u2014 a common sedative drug.\n\n\u2018Noise-cancelling headphones are best to drown out all the hospital bustle. This affordable set is comfy, folding flat for easy packing.\u2019\n\nWATER BOTTLE\n\nTry: The increment bottle, from \u00a34.99, amazon.co.uk\n\nHydration is vital when you\u2019re recovering, as it keeps your body functioning at its peak. Zoe Andrews says: \u2018Dehydration can delay wound healing and lead to urinary tract infections \u2014 a potentially serious problem in older patients following surgery.\n\n\u2018Drinking more water causes you to urinate more often, flushing out the bladder regularly, so bacteria don\u2019t have a chance to take hold and multiply, triggering infection.\n\n\u2018This bottle helps you monitor your intake. It has the times of day marked in increments, showing you how much to drink at different points to help you hit a daily target of two litres.\u2019\n\nPre-operative anxiety can raise stress hormone levels in the body which can, in turn, slow recovery (stock image)\n\nCHILLED TOWEL\n\nTry: Stay Cool ice towel, \u00a37.77, amazon.co.uk\n\nMaintaining a good temperature can be a challenge in hospital \u2014 it can depend on how mobile you are, your age, the time of the day and the environment, and sometimes hospitals can be very warm, especially in summer.\n\n\u2018A product such as the Stay Cool ice towel, which keeps cool for long periods, can make you feel more comfortable,\u2019 says Zoe Andrews.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s easy to use: simply wet it and wring out excess water. Its special microfibre fabric locks in the moisture to remain cool and damp for up to two hours.\u2019\n\nGINGER TEA & SWEETS\n\nTry: Pukka Herbs three ginger herbal tea, pack of 20 tea bags, \u00a32.50, ocado.com; Sula sugar-free boiled sweets, 42g, \u00a31.19, hollandandbarrett.com\n\n\u2018Ginger drinks help with nausea, so they could be good if you\u2019re having chemotherapy, which can produce feelings of sickness, or after any surgery, as a general anaesthetic can leave patients feeling queasy,\u2019 says Julia Frater, a specialist cancer information nurse at Cancer Research UK.\n\n\u2018Sucking boiled sweets can help, too, as some patients find treatments such as chemotherapy leave an unpleasant taste or dryness in their mouth.\u2019\n\nMaintaining a good temperature can be a challenge in hospital \u2014 it can depend on how mobile you are, your age, the time of the day and the environment (stock image)\n\nPROTEIN SNACK BARS\n\nTry: Applied Nutrition protein indulgence bar, box of 12, \u00a318.95, amazon.co.uk\n\n\u2018I recommend patients pack protein and fibre-rich snacks \u2014 but check with your doctor first, in case your procedure has any dietary restrictions,\u2019 says Rich Viney, a consultant urological surgeon at University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust and BMI The Priory Hospital in Birmingham.\n\n\u2018Protein can speed up the repair of damaged tissue, while fibre helps prevent constipation from prolonged bedrest and certain painkillers.\n\n\u2018Patients often like to graze while recovering, rather than eating three square meals. This snack bar is high in soy protein, low in sugar and comes in chocolate, hazelnut and even birthday cake flavour, so it tastes good, too.\n\n\u2018For fibre, you can\u2019t beat two or three prunes or dates a day.\u2019\n\nSLEEP MASK\n\nTry: Dormibene mulberry silk mask set, \u00a38.99, amazon.co.uk\n\nHospital wards are brightly lit: most turn their lights down only late at night, and they never go completely dark, says Julia Frater, so an eye mask is a must.\n\n\u2018Sleep is when the body heals, so the better you sleep, the quicker you will recover from treatment.\n\n\u2018Hospitals are also noisy places, so earplugs are useful. This eye mask comes with a travel pouch and earplugs, and has an adjustable elastic strap. As it sits quite low down the face, it doesn\u2019t let in any light around the nose.'", "description": "What should be in your bag?
