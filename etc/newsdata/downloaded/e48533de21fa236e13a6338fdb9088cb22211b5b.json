After evaluating the player, medical staff determined a cart was not necessary in this instance. Had one been needed, there was a backup cart on the other sideline which was immediately available. He received appropriate medical care per game day protocols, and is now in the concussion protocol.\u201d\n\nPost-match, Thomas said it definitely wasn\u2019t intentional.\n\n\u201cI hit the strike zone like we talk about. I didn\u2019t go high,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cI didn\u2019t intentionally try to hurt him. I\u2019m worried about him. I heard he\u2019s at the hospital. My prayers go out to him and his family.
