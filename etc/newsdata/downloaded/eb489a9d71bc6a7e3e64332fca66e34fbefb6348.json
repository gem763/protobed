And we're going to have some very interesting conversation. Things are going very well with our military. We have spent $2.5 trillion since I've been president, and we built our military,' Trump began his public briefing joined by top brass.\n\nPresident Trump honored top military officials and their souses and families at a White House dinner Monday night. Among those in attendance were top Generals and Admirals from every branch, including the Commandant of the Coast Guard and Marines\n\nThe dinner followed a briefing earlier in the day with top brass \u2013 which came after a day of the president defending his controversial decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria\n\nJoint Chiefs of Staff Chairman and Army General Mark Milley attended the briefing and dinner\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper was also present \u2013 he is a retired Army lieutenant colonel\n\nThe president spent a little over two minutes making remarks on his meeting and then took questions from the press, where he then filled about seven minutes defending his move to withdraw troops from Syria, dismissing the two whistle-blowers in the Ukraine scandal and bashing Democratic leaders.\n\nTrump spent Monday insisting his decision to take U.S. troops out of northern Syria was the right move. At the same time unconfirmed claims indicated Turkey began launching aerial attacks across the border, reportedly where Kurdish forces are based.\n\nBut Trump told reporters gathered at the White House on Monday that he spoke to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erogdan in a phone call Sunday and told him that there would be consequences if harm comes to the dozens of remaining American servicemen and women there.\n\nThe president mainly washed his hands of the Syrian military quagmire, saying any resurgence of the ISIS terror army would no longer be America's immediate concern.\n\nEven those within the GOP were concerned by Trump's seemingly brash decision.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley and GOP Senator Lindsey Graham broke with the president on this one.\n\nRepublican Senator Mitt Romney called it a 'betrayal.'\n\n'The biggest lie being told by the administration [is] that ISIS is defeated,' Graham, one of Trump's closest allies in Congress, said on 'Fox & Friends.'\n\n'The caliphate is destroyed but there are thousands of fighters over there. And no, the caliphate would not have been destroyed without the Kurds,' he continued.\n\nThere was a lot of tension Monday \u2013 even within the Republican Party \u2013 over Trump's military orders\n\nDespite the tension \u2013 even within the president's own party \u2013 the night will be filled with entertaining those making military decisions everyday, even those that don't agree with the decision to remove troops from a volatile region.\n\nAlso those attending the dinner with their spouses and families are: Commander of United States Indo-Pacific Command General Phil Davidson; Commander of United States Forces Korea, United Nations Command and Combined Forces Command General Robert Abrams; Commander of United States Africa Command General Stephen Townsend; Commander Special Operations Command General Richard Clarke; Commander of United States Southern Command Admiral Craig Faller; and Commander of United States Cyber Command General Paul Nakasone.\n\nAlso Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Michael Gilday, Chief of Naval Operations; Commander of United States European Command and NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe General Tod Wolters; Commander of United States Transportation Command General Stephen Lyons; and Chief of Staff of the Army General James McConville.", "description": "Trump spent Monday evening honoring top military leaders at a White House dinner after a day of defending his move to pull troops out of northern Syria.", "authors": ["Katelyn Caralle", "U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/01/19419810-0-image-a-14_1570493786741.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
