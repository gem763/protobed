However, underneath the surface, there was some sector rotation that was taking place. It sent the and stocks higher, and lower.\n\nBased on the movement in yield and , the rotation seems rational and somewhat logical. The big question is if it will last? That part I\u2019m not sure at this point. One day doesn\u2019t make a trend, but I do not happen to think that oil and yields can continue to rise a bit more.\n\nS&P 500 (SPY)\n\nS&P 500 Index\n\nThe good news is that the index is holding support around 2975. Nothing in my outlook has changed.\n\nRussell (IWM)\n\nRussell 2000 Index Chart\n\nThe had a great day, rising by over 1% today, and is attempting to clear resistance at 1,521. I think that is positive and that 1,536 is likely next.\n\nRoku (ROKU)\n\nRoku Inc Daily Chart\n\nIs the Roku (NASDAQ: ) bubble popping? It certainly seems possible. The stock\u2019s valuation makes Netflix (NASDAQ: ) look cheap. But at this point, you can see that the uptrend is still intact. However, should the stock drop below $155 then perhaps it sends the $100. But $155 is the level to watch.\n\nFreeport (FCX)\n\nFreeport-McMoran Copper & Gold (NYSE: ) jumped today, and the next level to watch for is $9.90.\n\nFreeport Inc Daily Chart\n\nLululemon (LULU)\n\nLululemon Athletica (NASDAQ: ) was down today after last week\u2019s significant gains. But for now, it holds support at $195. However, a break of support will send shares towards $189.\n\nLululemon Inc Daily Chart\n\nApple (AAPL)\n\nApple (NASDAQ: ) got close to failed at resistance around $217. I saw bearish options betting in the stock. It has me thinking that perhaps the stocks run may cool some. $209.50 is the next level of support.\n\nApple Inc Daily Chart\n\nNXP (NXPI)\n\nNXP (NASDAQ: ) looks as if it may have broken out rise above $106. We have been waiting for this for some time.
