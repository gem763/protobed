In a way moving to America was good as it kept everybody off our backs. You get more privacy. The minute you show up to the hospital here it's 'what's going on?'.\n\n\"The thing with Tans is, you look at the papers now with the two football wives. Tanya got offered hundreds and hundreds of opportunities to do modelling and stories.\n\n\"She never done none of them. She\u2019s the opposite to these girls now.\n\n\"People say to me 'what do you think of these girls?' I think it's quite funny and everything else.\n\n\"But what about the embarrassment to their husbands? No thought of the kids.\"\n\n(Image: Wayne Rooney Instagram)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nDuring the emotional interview, Vinnie bravely discussed his final moments with his wife.\n\nHe revealed that doctors phoned them on Christmas Eve last year with the devastating news, but Tanya was determined to battle through the pain for her family and friends.\n\nVinnie said: \"They called Christmas Eve and said we've found a couple of spots on the brain. That's the first time we broke down together. We were in the house but had a lot of guests there.\n\n\"She didn\u2019t want to ruin their Christmas. That was the worst time we ever broke down together.\n\n\"She wanted to get through the Christmas so they put her on steroids. It really puffed her out. she was unrecognisable, because she was a fantastically gorgeous woman.\n\n\"She went on the steroids to get through the Christmas. I don\u2019t think if she knew but she kept getting us all together. She was in and out of pain but got through it brilliantly.\n\n\"When we got back she started booking for this Christmas. I think she knew she wasn\u2019t going to make this Christmas.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nVinnie also gave an update on his own wellbeing in the wake of his wife's tragic death.\n\nThe former Wimbledon and Leeds United player confessed it had been a struggle to watch people go about their normal lives while he was struggling with grief.\n\nWhen asked how he was doing, Vinnie admitted he was \"keeping busy\".\n\nHe added: \"I think you've got to get out there for other guys who are struggling. We've had some unbelievable emails and messages. it makes a difference. I didn't see that coming.\n\n\"Whenever you think you've got a problem, however hard it is, there is someone round the corner with bigger problems.\n\n\"I've got some great friends. Mine is not a celebrity list. It's people I grew up with around Watford, Hemel Hempstead and Bedmond. They're the people to turn to.\n\n\"The hardest part of it all for me to adjust to, even that day, everyone's life goes on.\n\n\"You're looking around. This is the biggest tragedy of your life. And people are still going to work and queuing up for Starbucks. The enormity of it all is hard.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nGood Morning Britain viewers flocked to Twitter to praise Vinnie for bravely opening up.\n\nOne fan said: \"Honest and open interview Vinnie. Vinnie opened up honestly when it comes to Tanya. Proves Vinnie is human. Heartbreaking\"\n\n\"Incredible interview with @VinnieJones65 on #GMB this morning. Heartfelt emotion about losing his best friend and life partner and a great message to those men going through/have gone through but are too afraid to talk about it. Stay strong Vinnie lad. We're all with you on this,\" added another.\n\nA third said: \"Vinnie Jones, what a brave man to come on TV so soon after & be so open & honest about his grief.\"\n\n\"Sobbing after watching @VinnieJones65 on #gmb beautiful and sincere about his beloved Tanya. A raw memory of losing my bestie. True words. Never take away hope and live each day.
