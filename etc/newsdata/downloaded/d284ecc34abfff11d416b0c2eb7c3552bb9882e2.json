The 31-year-old woman was developmentally disabled and had a son\n\nGarbutt was arrested in connection to Campbell\u2019s death seven months later.\n\nThe man told police Campbell had fallen and hurt her head after returning home one day in June 2009, and that he suffocated her with a plastic bag because he feared he would be blamed for her injuries.\n\nThe man was tried for Campbell\u2019s killing in October 2018, but a judge presiding over the case declare a mistrial over a report concerning two heretofore unknown witnesses, which emerged while testimony was under way.\n\nGarbutt\u2019s public defender told a jury it was Myesha Smith, the defendant\u2019s ex-girlfriend, who killed Campbell, and that the man took the blame so that their child would not grow up without a mother.\n\nCampbell's relatives reacted with outrage to the plea deal, as part of which Garbutt has received credit for time served\n\nPolice found Smith to be in possession of the victim\u2019s personal property, including her identification card, a month after Campbell\u2019s disappearance, but she was never prosecuted for a crime and was ultimately granted immunity in exchange for her testimony against Garbutt.\n\nGarbutt has been jailed since February 2016 and has received four years' worth of credit for time served.\n\nSome of the victim\u2019s family members decried Garbutt's sentence as too short and inadequate, given the heinous nature of the crime.\n\n\u2018The irony is this man will probably only do about as much time as she was while she was in the wall,\u2019 Raven Campbell\u2019s sister Cynthia Campbell Kemp said in court. \u2018The punishment is not just, but we\u2019re just going to have to accept it.\u2019", "description": "Randolph Garbutt, 47, has pleaded no contest to voluntary manslaughter and was sentenced to 11 years for the June 2009 killing of 31-year-old mom-of-one Raven Campbell\u00a0 in Los Angeles.", "authors": ["Snejana Farberov For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/19/19500262-0-image-a-28_1570645567870.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
