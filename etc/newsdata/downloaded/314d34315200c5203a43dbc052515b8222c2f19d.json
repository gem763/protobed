Seven goals conceded against Bayern Munich, now three more against Brighton, and the epitaphs are being written for a team that were just 90 minutes away from European glory.\n\nAt the Amex on Saturday, Spurs were lethargic, lacking any kind of intensity and desire, and trudged off the pitch at full-time looking relieved to be heading off on international duty. This was billed as a chance to bounce back, show their fight, but it carried only a strong whiff of the old clich\u00e9 that the players are no longer trying for their manager.\n\nBut a squad that has given up should not always point to a manager who needs to go. Particularly a manager in Mauricio Pochettino who foresaw this coming, and whose achievements and loyalty over the past five years have earnt him more than enough credit to survive even the dreariest of seasons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll the cryptic comments he made at the tail-end of last season have become far easier to decipher with the benefit of having seen Spurs\u2019 sub-par start to the new campaign. Pochettino spoke of creating a \u2018new project\u2019 and being \u2018brave\u2019. But they didn\u2019t, and they weren\u2019t.\n\nSpurs\u2019 decline has not been overnight. Performances since the turn of the year have been poor \u2013 they have not won a Premier League away game since a stoppage-time strike against Fulham in January, 10 games ago \u2013 while inaction in the transfer market over two wasted years created glaring deficiencies in the squad that have only been exacerbated.\n\nSpurs gave a woeful display as Brighton ripped them apart at will (Picture: Getty)\n\nThe club have needed new full-backs and fresh legs in midfield since Kyle Walker left for Manchester City and Mousa Dembele\u2019s body started to crumble. Admittedly the belated arrival of Tanguy Ndombele will help rectify the latter problem, though the lack of a destroyer is noticeable \u2013 even at Dembele\u2019s best, he had the likes of Sandro and a fit and functioning Victor Wanyama beside him.\n\nAgainst Brighton, Moussa Sissoko was forced to fill in at right-back and there is a strong argument that Spurs \u2013 whose calling card in the early years under Pochettino was the pace, power and attacking intent of their full-backs \u2013 now have the worst pairing of any top-10 side.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese blindingly obvious issues should have been addressed far sooner, and it has created a backlog of further problems that need to be dealt with. A more prescient club might have been looking at upgrading Hugo Lloris over the summer \u2013 who made yet another gaffe that resulted in a serious injury \u2013 but instead they were still dealing with problems that could have been eradicated years ago.\n\nAs way of comparison, Antonio Conte was backed to the tune of \u00a3140million over the summer at Inter Milan, allowed to sign 12 players \u2013 and ship out over twice that number \u2013 that fitted his style. Pochettino probably wanted something similar when he spoke of his \u2018crazy ideas\u2019, but he only got three signings and much of the deadwood remained.\n\nAgainst Brighton, Spurs were bereft of all the qualities that had become trademarks under the Argentine. The press was non-existent, as has been the case going back to the start of last season, with Son-Heung Min often a solitary figure hounding the defence and Harry Kane lacking the mobility and energy that has been robbed of him by repeated ligament injuries.\n\nJermaine Jenas urges Spurs to keep faith in Pochettino \u2018I feel that the blame lies with them all. I think Daniel Levy in terms of support for his manager has not been great, the timing of the signings and the amount of signings coming into the club has not been great. I think the players are not applying themselves to the level that they should be. And I do believe within all that, if Mauricio does have a look at himself maybe there\u2019s a part of him that thinks that\u2019s as far as he can take this football club and this group of players. I hope they sort it out. He\u2019s a top manager and I don\u2019t see where else you go. In my opinion, I just feel that if they had listened to him [in the summer], they wouldn\u2019t be in this situation now.\u2019 (BT Sport)\n\nThe defence sat off too, leaving a vast gap in midfield for Brighton to exploit, while Christian Eriksen gave another lacklustre display that suggested his head is elsewhere. There was a time when Pochettino would be screaming on the sidelines for his side to push up even when they were on the halfway line, not anymore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut these issues feel like one of personnel, not tactics. Toby Alderweireld \u2013 who backed off and backed off before letting Aaron Connolly net his second goal in almost identical fashion to when he was ripped apart by Serge Gnabry \u2013 is getting older. Still a brilliant defender, but perhaps no longer a Pochettino one.\n\nIn fact, four of the back five that started against Brighton were over the age of 30. This is not a young team anymore, it is not one possessed of the athleticism needed to sustain a high press for a full match \u2013 as their blow-out against Bayern showed. Nor are they a team that will be together for much longer. Alderweireld, Eriksen and Jan Vertonghen are all out of contract in the summer.\n\nA rebuild is on the way one way or another \u2013 one that Pochettino evidentially saw coming and tried to pre-empt \u2013 and there is not a manager in world football Spurs could realistically attract who is better equipped to start over and get the team challenging for trophies again.\n\nBut for that to happen, a reframing of where Tottenham are right now is required. Last season\u2019s scarcely believable Champions League run \u2013 in which Spurs only won one more match than they lost \u2013 was not a step forward, but disguised a clear regression. Spurs are not title challengers, and have not been for 18 months. They peaked in 2017, racking up a club-record 86 points to fall just short of title winners Chelsea.\n\nAccepting that, and accepting the need the need to go again, is key. Every team needs that sense of having a pathway in front of them, a goal to work towards; right now Spurs are just treading water, one dispiriting performance after another, and it\u2019s time to hit the reset button.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe signs are clear that this current Tottenham cycle ended in Madrid, arguably even earlier. But that does not mean Pochettino\u2019s time is over, it is simply the cyclical nature of football \u2013 even the best teams can\u2019t sustain their level indefinitely. This Spurs side needs refreshing and no-one is more aware of that than Pochettino, nor more capable.
