Service delivery was acceptable, key outputs had been met and compliance achieved, but service delivery was compromised by ineffective spending. There were numerous outsourced contracts that compromised value for money;\n\n. Basic service delivery had declined as a result of vacancies at senior management level, particularly corporate and human resources, as well as community and emergency services. Community stability was compromised by a lack of enforcement; . There had been a significant increase in service delivery protests and damage to council property and infrastructure; . Exco decisions were not implemented. The finance portfolio committee had been disbanded and financial oversight was compromised; . Debate and discussion in council was stifled, frustrating decision-making processes and compromising transparency; . There was some intra-party tension within the ANC; . Business forums and political interference in administration negatively affected service delivery. Project implementation was compromised as a result of delays in procurement processes, decision-making, poor project management and oversight; . In opposition-led wards, councillors were not fully engaged on ward projects and contractors reported to proportional representation councillors; . The image and reputation of the municipality had been severely affected by negative media coverage, which had the potential to create negative economic consequences through credit ratings; and . Allegations of fraud and corruption were evident.\n\nThe city was involved in 399 cases of litigation \u2013 124 instituted by the city and 275 instituted against it.\n\n\n\nThe report found that, since July last year, 320 instances of fraud and corruption had been reported at eThekwini; 179 disciplinary cases for fraud and corruption had been instituted for the same period and there were 42 dismissals.\n\nIn the past quarter, 92 forensic investigations into fraud and corruption were initiated, 87 were conducted.\n\nIt was found that since July last year 11 councillors had been fingered for noncompliance with the councillor\u2019s code, but no one was dismissed.\n\nThere were 12 unprotected strikes within the municipality in the past quarter, with grievances against management cited as the cause in each one.\n\nThere was no indication that the \u201cno-work, no-pay\u201d rule was used for strikers.\n\nAlthough not mentioned in the report, the municipality waived the \u201cno-work, no-pay\u201d policy when waste collection workers took part in an illegal strike in late April that resulted in them rampaging through the city centre.\n\nThey were protesting against the municipality flouting its own policies by promoting 55 Umkhonto weSizwe veterans whose salaries were consequently hiked from about R9 000 to R20 000 a month.\n\nDespite the striking workers sabotaging water infrastructure, blocking freeways, damaging property and making the city a no-go zone, the Gumede-led executive council offered them the opportunity for promotion.\n\nAs for intergovernmental relations (IGR), the report said all the city\u2019s clusters \u2013 human resources and governance; community and health services; infrastructure, human settlements and transport; finance; economic development; and safety and security \u2013 were \u201cpartially functional\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe IGR clusters are not meeting objectives as they are factionalised politically. ANC caucuses are not meeting in preparation for meetings.\u201d\n\nRead: Gumede axed as mayor after ANC KZN enforces sweeping changes\n\nDecisions of \u201cpoor quality\u201d were being taken at the cluster meetings.\n\n\u201cThe municipality is struggling to deliver services to the community,\u201d said the report, but a war room had been established to deal with the issues.\n\nThe ANC\u2019s deputy chairperson in the province, Mike Mabuyakhulu, was leading the war room.\n\n(He is out on R50 000 bail for his alleged role in a scam related to a multimillion-rand KwaZulu-Natal jazz festival that was paid for and did not take place. He was an MEC at the time of the alleged crime and has denied any wrongdoing.)\n\nInternal reports\n\nSeveral damning findings were made in meetings open to the media and in documents that were publicly available, should the ANC have wanted to have axed Gumede sooner, based on her performance.\n\nIn the 2017/2018 financial period, the Auditor-General found the city racked up R732 million in irregular expenditure, with \u201cno reasonable steps\u201d being instituted to curb it.\n\nThe majority of the irregular expenditure was as a result of \u201cnoncompliance with supply chain management regulations to the procurement of goods and services\u201d.\n\nAn irregular expenditure report prepared at the end of June and presented at an open Exco meeting found that for the 2018/2019 financial period, the city had racked up irregular expenditure of R581 492 759.38.\n\nIncluded in this amount was R138 272 435.63 relating to previous financial years (prior to 2018/2019) and R443 220 323.75 relating to the 2018/2019 financial year.\n\nThe amount again related to non-complaince supply chain management that had been submitted through the bid adjudication committee in terms of section 36 of the supply chain management policy.\n\nEthekwini\u2019s chief financial officer, Krish Kumar, told Exco that there \u201ccould be\u201d fraud and corruption among the irregular expenditure, but added that the city had contained it by instituting better controls.\n\nIn July an internal audit committee report for the third quarter that was presented at another open Exco meeting showed that the city had racked up R50.2 million in irregular expenditure in three months, for the period ending in March this year.\n\nThe breakdown of the irregular expenditure showed that the city\u2019s electricity and water and sanitation units had procured services on expired contracts and its human settlements department had allowed for upgrades at the notorious Glebelands Hostel in Umlazi without a tender process.\n\nServices were provided to Moses Mabhida Stadium without valid contracts, while the economic development department flouted supply chain management processes for a low-cost housing development.\n\nDamning findings by government departments and several unfavourable internal reports proved to be the Achilles heel that finally felled eThekwini municipality\u2019s criminally charged mayor Zandile Gumede.\n\nThe same department did not comply with the Municipal Finances Management Act for the upgrade of water mains projects.\n\nSeveral \u201cother\u201d business units had provided services without contracts, noted the report.\n\nIn each case the report stated that \u201cno action [had been] taken regarding consequence management\u201d.\n\nThe report was presented by the audit committee chairperson, Nala Mhlongo, who told Exco he disagreed with the reasoning that, \u201cno corrective action had been initiated because no fraud had been committed\u201d.\n\nThe audit committee is an independent advisory body appointed by council but has no executive powers.\n\nThe committee recommended that \u201cconsequence management\u201d be initiated against deputy city managers who \u201cfailed to take corrective actions on matters associated with irregularities\u201d.\n\nAs for the city\u2019s disciplinary board \u2013 established in 2017 to ensure cases of financial misconduct were investigated impartially and corrective action taken \u2013 the same audit committee report found its scope was restricted because it didn\u2019t deal with \u201coversight of the entire value chain\u201d, including hotline allegations, investigation and disciplinary processes.\n\nThe disciplinary board dealt only with financial misconduct, had not reported to Exco or the municipal public accounts committee and there were \u201cchallenges\u201d about disciplinary board meetings.\n\nThere was a high backlog of disciplinary cases for financial misconduct.\n\nThe report highlighted the \u201cinactivity\u201d by management to deal with employees who had been arrested based on allegations of fraud and corruption as the implicated were still performing their duties.\n\nCity management did not provide the audit committee with risk mitigation controls relating to victimisation of witnesses who were the subordinates of those involved in allegations of fraud and corruption.\n\nThere were also no risk controls provided to prevent tampering with \u201cessential evidence such as audit trails and physical supporting documents\u201d.\n\n\u201cNew allegations of similar irregularities may arise as a result of their continued involvement with the functions,\u201d said the report.\n\nIt was noted that \u201ca bad perception that the city is tolerant of corruption may be created among other employees\u201d.\n\nThe report also highlighted the city\u2019s failure to implement the City Integrity and Investigation Unit recommendations against staff implicated in wrongdoing.\n\nThere were a total of 400 matters that still had to be resolved.\n\nTALK TO US\n\nDo you think Zandile Gumede has been treated fairly,
