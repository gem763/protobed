A yearly take-home of less than \u00a34,000 is the norm.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThey also have to go without a weekly retainer, receive no sick, illness or childcare benefits and have to meet to the same fitness levels as officials in the Football League to qualify for the job.\n\nWomen officials also find themselves evaluated on an equivalent basis as the men in the Premier League and Championship with their decisions in the Super League receiving the same level of scrutiny.\n\nThe plight of their assistants is just as bad.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nSian Massey, an assistant in the Premier League, earns a salary of \u00a340,000 and a match fee of \u00a3500 if she runs the line in the top flight.\n\nAssistant referees in the Women\u2019s Super League are paid just \u00a360... the same as those working in the men\u2019s National League \u2013 the fifth tier of the English game.\n\nA Football Association spokesperson said: \u201cWe are fully committed to the development of match officials and we recently appointed a National Refereeing Manager to focus on the women\u2019s professional game.\n\n\u201cWe are always open to further discussions with football\u2019s stakeholders about the future professional development of referees as revenues grow in the game.\u201d", "description": "Top male officials make around \u00a3100,000 per year while their female equivalents are asked to do the same job for 20 time less", "authors": ["Neil Moxley", "Image", "Afp Getty Images", "Getty Images", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20469957.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FBL-ENG-PR-ASTON-VILLA-WEST-HAM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
