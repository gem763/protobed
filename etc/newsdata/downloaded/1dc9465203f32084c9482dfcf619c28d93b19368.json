REUTERS/Darren Whiteside\n\nThe almost new Boeing Co (BA.N) aircraft had been flying from Jakarta to the town of Pangkal Pinang, on the Bangka-Belitung islands off Sumatra, when it crashed, just minutes after take-off.\n\nTuesday\u2019s commemoration came days after Indonesian investigators issued their final report into the disaster, setting out Boeing\u2019s failure to identify risks in the design of cockpit software and recommending better training for Lion Air\u2019s pilots.\n\nSome members of victims\u2019 families were taken by boat to the crash site off the West Java town of Karawang to throw petals into the sea, an act of tribute relatives also performed on Nov. 8 last year.\n\nIn Pangkal Pinang, employees at the town\u2019s tax office held special prayers for seven of their colleagues who died in the crash, according to tax office head Krisna Wiryawan.\n\nA tribute video made by friends and colleagues included a slide show with photos of the victims in happier times.\n\n\u201cWhen the loved ones are gone, only memories remain. These memories will remain in our hearts,\u201d read a message near the end of the video.\n\nThe fatal crash, followed within five months by another at Ethiopian Airlines, led to a global grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX and a crisis for the world\u2019s biggest planemaker, which last week ousted its commercial airplanes chief.\n\nIndonesian regulators criticised the design of the 737 MAX\u2019s anti-stall system, known as MCAS, which automatically pushed the plane\u2019s nose down, leaving pilots fighting for control.\n\nInvestigators attributed the Lion Air crash to a number of factors, including design flaws and inadequate regulatory oversight, as well as errors by Lion Air pilots and engineers.\n\nIn a statement placed in Indonesian newspapers on Tuesday, , Boeing president and chief executive Dennis Muilenburg said, \u201cWe are deeply sorry and grieve for the loss of life.\u201d\n\n\u201cMay God rest their souls in peace, provide strength to their families, and keep their memories alive,\u201d he said.\n\nMuilenburg also visited the Indonesian embassy in Washington on Monday to offer condolences ahead of testifying before the U.S. senate on Tuesday.\n\nSpeaking in Jakarta, Indonesian Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said she hoped the relatives of the victims would receive proper compensation for their loss.\n\nIn September, Boeing settled first claims with representatives of the family members. Three people familiar with the matter said family members are set to receive at least $1.2 million each.\n\nThat amount would be for a single victim without any dependents, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity because negotiations on the subject were confidential.", "description": "One year on from the Lion Air plane crash that killed 189, relatives and friends of victims held prayer vigils and cast flower petals into the Java Sea at the site where the budget carrier's Boeing 737 MAX jet went down beneath the waves.", "authors": ["Jessica Damiana", "Tabita Diela", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446105859&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S0F5", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
