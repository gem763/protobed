We were wrong,\u201d the Astros said in a statement Thursday. \u201cSubsequent interviews have revealed that Taubman\u2019s inappropriate comments were, in fact, directed toward one or more reporters. Accordingly, we have terminated Brandon Taubman\u2019s employment.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Sports Illustrated reporter Stephanie Apstein published an account that said Taubman had taunted her and other female reporters following the Astros\u2019 playoff series-clinching win over the New York Yankees last week about how glad he was to have acquired relief pitcher Roberto Osuna last season.\n\nRead: Astros exec\u2019s \u2018offensive and frightening\u2019 rant just created a lot of Nationals fans\n\nIn 2018, Osuna was accused of domestic abuse as a member of the Toronto Blue Jays, though charges were dropped when the mother of his child declined to travel to Canada to testify. Major League Baseball suspended him for 75 games for violating its domestic violence policy.\n\nApstein described the incident: \u201cAnd in the center of the room, assistant general manager Brandon Taubman turned to a group of three female reporters, including one wearing a purple domestic-violence awareness bracelet, and yelled, half a dozen times, \u2018Thank God we got Osuna! I\u2019m so f------ glad we got Osuna!\u2019\n\n\u201cThe outburst was offensive and frightening enough that another Houston staffer apologized,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe Astros initially disputed the account and called Apstein\u2019s story \u201cmisleading and completely irresponsible.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe sincerely apologize to Stephanie Apstein, Sports Illustrated and to all individuals who witnessed the incident,\u201d the Astros said in their statement Thursday.\n\nThe heavily favored Astros lost the first two game of the World Series at home, and travel to Washington to face the Nationals in Game 3 on Friday.\n\nTaubman came to the Astros organization in 2013 from accounting firm Ernst & Young, where he worked as a derivative valuation expert. This week, reports emerged about a sexist presentation on how women should act in the workplace that Ernst & Young put on in June 2018.", "description": "The Houston Astros fired assistant general manager Brandon Taubman on Thursday following belligerent comments he made toward female reporters.", "authors": ["Mike Murphy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT995_astros_ZG_20191024182354.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
