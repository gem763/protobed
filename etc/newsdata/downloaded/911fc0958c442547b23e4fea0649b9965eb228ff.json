Shaw on Tuesday called for Emerson Electric Co to split itself into two separate businesses, arguing that the move could unlock more than $20 billion worth of shareholder value.\n\nThe hedge fund, which holds a more than 1% stake in Emerson, said the industrial conglomerate's stock was undervalued and it should split into a pure play industrial automation business and a climate technology-focused firm, in a letter to the company's board.\n\n\"The set of steps we have proposed could result in more than 50% appreciation in Emerson\u2019s stock price,\" D.E. Shaw said in the letter.\n\nThe hedge fund also said Emerson has the potential to reduce its costs by $1 billion annually and needs to align its executive compensation with shareholder returns.\n\n\"We will carefully evaluate D.E. Shaw\u2019s proposals as we continue to assess value-creation opportunities,\" Emerson said in response to the letter.\n\nThe hedge fund's move comes more than two weeks after Reuters reported that the D.E.
