US Ambassador to the UN Kelly Craft gave almost a verbatim statement to the UN Security Council just the day before they were sent out to embassies.\n\nThis goes to show that while Trump may be happy with this Syria decision, his own administration is worried about the consequences. That becomes clearer as other talking points, labeled \u201csensitive but unclassified,\u201d note devastation happening inside Syria.\n\n\u201cTurkey does not appear to be mitigating the humanitarian impact of its invasion and occupation of some parts of northeast Syria,\u201d the cable continues, adding that the administration had \u201ccalled on Turkey to investigate possible violations of international humanitarian law, especially unlawful attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure.\u201d That Turkey would look into human rights violations is unlikely, though, as Turkish backed forces are responsible for multiple civilian deaths, including the murder of a Syrian Kurdish politician.\n\nWhile the US does seem concerned about these events, it doesn\u2019t plan to do much about them \u2014 and it is even discouraging foreign governments from assisting in certain parts of Syria.\n\nThe State Department\u2019s talking points indicate that the US has chosen to withdraw civilian personnel from Syria, including humanitarian and stabilization assistance advisers that help ease suffering in war-torn countries. However, they do say the US remains \u201ccommitted\u201d to these programs and \u201cwill continue to monitor programs remotely as we do in other conflicts afflicted areas of the world.\u201d\n\nThe removal of the personnel makes all that difficult, though. State\u2019s points go on to highlight the $50 million in aid the US plans to distribute for \u201cthe protection of human rights and accountability\u201d in Syria, but it\u2019s unclear who on the ground can ensure the proper and effective use of the money. That\u2019s likely why the talking points ask \u201cdonor governments to contribute additional funding to support stabilization programming to secure the enduring defeat of ISIS\u201d and other humanitarian aid.\n\nDespite asking for other nations to contribute this funding, the US also is apparently asking other countries to limit their generosity: \u201cWith the exception of emergency relief and humanitarian assistance, the United States will not provide any stabilization or reconstruction funds in areas under Turkish of Syrian Regime control; we urge you to do the same.\u201d This part, it should be said, is consistent with the administration\u2019s stance that Americans allies and partners should have no ties with the Syrian regime.\n\nBut put together, the US is saying that Turkey\u2019s incursion is making the lasting defeat of ISIS harder, the humanitarian situation in the region worse, and that no government should offer financial support for the most afflicted areas \u2014 unless they mainly help the fight against ISIS.\n\nOne can only imagine the reaction in foreign capitals as their American counterparts deliver the message, especially as Trump brags about his decision 11 days ago that let all this happen in the first place.\n\nTrump\u2019s Syria policy is morally bankrupt\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that these talking points came out hours before the US helped broker a ceasefire between Turkish and Syrian Kurdish forces that days later doesn\u2019t seem to be holding very well. Even Defense Secretary Mark Esper shed doubt on the ceasefire\u2019s effectiveness Sunday when he told reporters \u201coverall the cease-fire generally seems to be holding\u201d and that \u201cwe do get reports of intermittent fires, this and that.\u201d (\u201cOverall\u201d and \u201cgenerally\u201d are quite the qualifiers).\n\nHowever, a State Department official told me the talking points have yet to be updated since the ceasefire, which means these are the main messages American diplomats continue to relay around the world. The State Department\u2019s press team did not immediately return a request for comment on Sunday, which was expected since many staffers aren\u2019t working.\n\nTrump had three years to plan for his desired Syria departure since he took office.\n\nBut instead of anticipating that Turkey might take advantage of the US troop withdrawal to launch military action against the Syrian Kurds \u2014 which any expert on the conflict could have told him was a real possibility \u2014 before withdrawing the troops, Trump made a seemingly spur-of-the-moment decision to pull out them out after a phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan on October 9.\n\nThat left the administration scrambling to deal with the impending Turkish invasion after having already squandered what little leverage it had to deter unwanted actions by Turkey and strike a diplomatic deal that may have at least temporarily pleased the players involved.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing for Trump to want Americans troops out of Syria. But it\u2019s another to take them out, unleash chaos, and do very little about it. That morally bankrupt policy, however, is official US policy at this point.", "description": "Trump praises his Syria withdrawal message, saying Turkey will handle ISIS and more.
