It was a warmup game, but with the intensity of a tournament match. Ireland was impressive and, remarkably, picked up the No. 1 ranking for the first time.\n\nBut the ranking could be lost before they even play Scotland, and restored to New Zealand if the All Blacks beat South Africa on Saturday. South Africa could even end up being No. 1 by the end of the opening weekend.\n\nThe Irish won\u2019t be worried, though. They already feel enough responsibility to prove they are a contender and not a pretender with the year they\u2019ve had, without having to live up to being No. 1.\n\nNobody is more nervous in the squad than the forensic-minded Joe Schmidt. He became Ireland coach halfway through the previous World Cup cycle, so didn\u2019t feel entirely responsible when a high-flying Ireland depleted by injuries and suspension was shredded by Argentina in the 2015 quarterfinals. Schmidt promised to make Ireland\u2019s playing stocks deeper and stronger, to be able to cover all the bases, and he has the butterflies as his four-year plan comes to fruition on Sunday.\n\nAsked if Ireland was ready to peak, Schmidt said: \u201cYou\u2019ve just got to hope so. You never quite know. But one thing I\u2019ll be really confident of is that we\u2019ll be tough to beat.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see a very collective effort, and that effort will make us tough to beat. I\u2019ve no doubt that the Scots will have been working away and will make themselves something similar. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a huge amount between the two teams, so whoever does get the bounce of the ball or just be a little more efficient than the other just may tip the balance.\u201d\n\nIreland trusts it won\u2019t need a bounce or tip. It has bullied the Scots of late, winning eight of their 12 contests in this decade. When the Irish pack has imposed itself, world-class halves Conor Murray and Jonathan Sexton have cashed in. Ireland was fortunate to leave Murrayfield with another win in February, however. Scotland dominated the second half but handicapped its chances by making 15 handling errors and losing three throw-ins.\n\nThe errors are a byproduct of the organized chaos the Scots are trying to play, but without the skill to match the ambition.\n\nWhen Gregor Townsend was hired as coach after Vern Cotter was axed after the last World Cup, he added an extra dimension in attack to match his go-for-broke personality. But Scotland has continued to struggle to perform consistently, and its record away from home is embarrassing.\n\nBut with Ireland not in a groove and without three of its British and Irish Lions backs who are injured, Townsend\u2019s squad believes it can hold its own in the set-pieces, put pressure on Murray and Sexton, and come through with its persistently high-tempo game.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a time to take on Ireland, I believe it\u2019s now, before they get a head of steam,\u201d fullback Stuart Hogg says. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time in a long time that we have got a really good squad to pick from. Everybody is fighting fit and gunning to get a starting jersey. The quality and standards in training have been right up there with the best I have been involved in.\n\n\u201cWe feel we are in a good place. We\u2019re concentrating on ourselves and making sure that we don\u2019t beat ourselves - we don\u2019t make too many silly errors - and make sure we make the most of every single possibility we get.\u201d\n\n___\n\nLineups:\n\nIreland: Jordan Larmour, Andrew Conway, Garry Ringrose, Bundee Aki, Jacob Stockdale, Jonathan Sexton, Conor Murray; CJ Stander, Josh van der Flier, Peter O\u2019Mahony, James Ryan, Iain Henderson, Tadhg Furlong, Rory Best (captain), Cian Healy.
