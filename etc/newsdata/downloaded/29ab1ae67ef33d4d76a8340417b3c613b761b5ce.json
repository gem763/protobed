Over the last year, Australia has supplied 64 per cent of China's iron ore needs, up from 50 per cent just five years ago.\n\nThis spike was partly due to supply disruptions in Brazil but is still well up on figures of around 40 per cent at the height of the so-called \"iron ore wars\" in 2009, when Chinese leaders worried publicly about being too reliant on Australia.\n\nAustralian coking coal, used in steel making, supplied 40 per cent of China's imports in the first half of this year, second only to neighbouring Mongolia.\n\nEarlier this year, there were some scares around coal import restrictions in China's north.\n\nChina also came up with a plan for its strategically important infant formula sector, which appeared to attempt to squeeze foreign players out of both ends of the supply chain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe plan was to try to increase the government\u2019s target for Chinese-produced formula, from about 47 per cent of the market to 60 per cent.\n\nHowever, Australian National University's head of the East Asian Bureau of Economic Research, Peter Drysdale, said that on the whole the strength in trade was unperturbed by political rhetoric.\n\n\"We have had a trough in the political relationship with China in the last few years, yet the trade has continued to trade robustly,\" he said.\n\nGoldman Sachs economist Andrew Boak said the relative risk of China changing its position on trade was likely a function of a combination of how easily China could substitute Australian goods and services, and how large a share Chinese demand of a given Australian good or service was.", "description": "Treasurer Josh Frydenberg says China's dependency on Australian imports will help maintain a peaceful trade balance with the superpower despite recent tensions around shared values.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3922%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_483%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/5fcae73b6525903ab7a163d86af7396abf643f5c", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
