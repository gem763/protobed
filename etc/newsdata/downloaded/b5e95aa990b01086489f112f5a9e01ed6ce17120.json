Maybe you don\u2019t have a score at all.\n\nAlthough that might not seem like a big deal, especially if you don\u2019t plan to borrow money anytime soon, it can still present problems in other areas.\n\nFor example, when healthy food blogger Vered DeLeeuw and her husband first moved to the United States, they didn\u2019t have a credit history. \u201cIt was very difficult,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was difficult to rent an apartment, to lease a car, even to buy a cell phone. Everyone wanted to see a good credit history.\u201d\n\nThe truth is, it\u2019s really tough to get by without decent credit. And one of the easiest ways to build credit is to open a credit card or take out a loan. But what if you don\u2019t want to take on debt just to get a good credit score? You still have options.\n\nHow Do You Establish A Credit Score In The First Place?\n\nThough there are a few competitors, including VantageScore, FICO credit scores are used in more than 90% of lending decisions made by financial institutions, according to Shawn Lane, co-founder and COO of the credit repair company FRS Credit.\n\nIn order to generate a FICO credit score, you need to meet three requirements:\n\nYour credit report shows at least one tradeline (credit-based account) that has been open for a minimum of six months. Lane noted that this account can\u2019t be in collections or be in dispute. You also have at least one tradeline with activity that\u2019s been reported to the credit bureaus within the past six months. Again, it can\u2019t be a collection account and can\u2019t be in dispute. Your credit reports don\u2019t show an indication that you\u2019re deceased. That might seem strange, but it sometimes happens if you share an account with someone who died.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have any accounts that have been open or active for at least six months, you don\u2019t have a credit score.\n\nWays To Build Credit Without Debt\n\nYou don\u2019t necessarily have to open a new credit card or take out a loan to establish a credit score. The same is true if you want to improve a score that\u2019s been bruised and battered by financial missteps. These alternatives probably won\u2019t send your score soaring into the 800s, but they will help you establish a credit history or bump up a bad score.\n\n1. Sign up to have rent payments reported to the credit bureaus.\n\nNora Carol Photography via Getty Images Several services allow you to have rent payments reported to the credit bureaus.\n\nEventually, DeLeeuw and her husband were able to rent an apartment by putting up a large cash deposit. Once a rental agreement was in place, they asked the building manager to report their rent payments to the credit bureaus. \u201cShe agreed, and that\u2019s how we started building credit without actually taking on debt,\u201d DeLeeuw said. \u201cWe simply made sure to pay our rent on time.\u201d\n\nNewer versions of the FICO score, including FICO 9 and FICO XD, consider rental information when calculating your score. So does VantageScore. However, most older versions of FICO that are widely used today do not consider rent to be a tradeline that gets reported to the credit bureaus. In fact, FICO estimates less than 1% of credit reports contain rental information.\n\nThe good news is that there are a few services you can sign up for that will report your rent activity, usually for a small fee, though they may not partner with all three of the major credit reporting bureaus. Your landlord also has to agree to participate. Rental Kharma, for example, costs $25 to set up and then $6.95 per month. It also allows you to have 24 months\u2019 worth of payments retroactively reported to Transunion for an extra $60 fee. Rent Reporters requires an enrollment fee of $94.95 and then a monthly fee of $9.95. Enrollment includes up to two years of back payments, which are reported to TransUnion and Equifax.\n\n2. Get added as an authorized user.\n\nOne of the easiest ways to establish credit without having to put yourself into any type of debt is to get added as an authorized user to a long-standing, high-limit card of a family member or close friend, said Michael Foguth, founder of Foguth Financial Group in Brighton, Michigan.\n\nAuthorized users basically piggyback on the credit history of the primary account holder. The card is reported on the authorized user\u2019s credit reports, and they\u2019re allowed to make purchases with the card. However, authorized users have no legal responsibility to pay the balance. \u201cThis tactic can help build your credit from scratch or improve your already established bad credit,\u201d Foguth said. \u201cIt can also boost your available credit and length of credit history, which are two contributing factors to your credit score.\u201d\n\nKeep in mind that as an authorized user, you don\u2019t actually need to have access to the card or use it in order for it to show up on your reports. As long as the primary cardholder uses the card and pays the bill on time, your score should benefit. On the other hand, if they max out the card and miss payments, your score will suffer \u2015 so choose whom you work with wisely.\n\nAlso keep in mind that being added as an authorized user won\u2019t necessarily have a huge impact on your score. The credit bureaus give less weight to authorized user status since you\u2019re not actually the one responsible for paying back the debt. Still, this strategy can bump up your score, especially if you have a thin credit file.\n\n3. Take out a credit-builder loan.\n\nseksan Mongkhonkhamsao via Getty Images The funds from a credit-builder loan stay safe in an interest-bearing bank account while you make payments.\n\nDon\u2019t let the word \u201cloan\u201d give you pause. Credit-builder loans are designed for people with no credit or bad credit, and don\u2019t work like a typical loan. \u201cIt is like a forced savings account,\u201d Lane said.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: You \u201cborrow\u201d a small sum of money, usually between $300 and $1,000. Those funds are secured by the bank in a deposit account such as a CD. You then make payments toward the loan in regular installments over the course of about a year. When the loan is repaid, the funds in the account are released to you, plus any interest that might have accrued.\n\nKeep in mind, however, that these loans aren\u2019t free. Usually, the lender will charge you an administrative fee and/or interest, so it\u2019s important to compare costs before taking out a credit-builder loan. (Credit unions are a great place to look.) Often, the fees are worth paying in order to establish good credit or help repair a poor credit score.\n\n4. \u201cBoost\u201d your score with utility payments.\n\nA strategy recommended by Mark B. Huntley, co-founder of the credit advice site Credit Knocks, is signing up for Experian Boost.\n\nThis free tool was designed to help people with thin files beef up their credit by showing responsible behavior in areas that aren\u2019t typically reported to the credit bureaus. By signing up for Experian Boost, you can get credit for paying phone and utility bills on time.\n\n\u201cYou can sign up through the credit agency and choose which of your bills you\u2019d like reported,\u201d Huntley said. By giving Experian access to your bank accounts, the agency will comb through your transactions to find the payments that qualify. \u201cExperian claims that their boost, on average, increases the user\u2019s credit score 13 points.\u201d\n\nThere are a few limitations to this service, however. For one, it only improves your Experian FICO score \u2015 Equifax and TransUnion will not receive updated payment information. It also only applies to the FICO 8 scoring model, so you won\u2019t see an improved score in other versions. And you have to pay your bills via your bank accounts; credit card transactions don\u2019t count.\n\nThe good news is that it\u2019s completely free and doesn\u2019t require you to open any new accounts. Plus, Experian ignores derogatory payment history and only pulls in the positive, so you don\u2019t have to worry about getting dinged for past mishaps. Simply pay your bills on time and your Experian score should get a boost (though there\u2019s no guarantee it will).\n\n5. Check your credit reports for errors.\n\nSpiffyJ via Getty Images An estimated one in five credit reports contain errors.\n\nDid you know your credit report could have at least one error on it? And if it does, there\u2019s a chance that error is causing your credit score to be lower than it should be.\n\nIn 2012, the Federal Trade Commission did a study of credit report errors and found that about 1 in 5 consumers has a \u201cconfirmed material error\u201d in at least one of their credit reports from the three major bureaus. A confirmed material error was defined as a mistake that, when corrected, would change their credit reports. And among that sample of people with credit report errors, about 5% had a mistake serious enough to result in a lower credit score that would cause them to pay higher interest rates on their debt.\n\nThat means if you have an error, finding it and disputing it with the credit bureau could result in an immediate lift to your score. To review your credit reports for errors, you can visit annualcreditreport.com, which is the only website that\u2019s federally authorized to provide credit reports from all three bureaus at no cost. You\u2019re allowed to request a free copy of your report once per year.\n\nComb over your reports for common mistakes such as the wrong name, missing accounts, duplicate accounts and accounts marked as past due that are actually in good standing. If you do find an error, you can dispute it online with the appropriate bureau:", "description": "You could piggyback on someone else's good credit instead.", "authors": ["Money", "Home", "Living Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da61309210000570fad0b2d.jpeg?cache=XONl2t7nT3&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
