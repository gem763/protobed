The legacy benefits are working tax credits, child tax credit, jobseeker's allowance, income support, employment support allowance and housing benefit\n\nA single universal credit payment is paid directly into the claimant's bank account each month\n\nMore than 1.5m people across Great Britain currently receive benefits through universal credit\n\nSource: House of Commons Library", "description": "Leader Jeremy Corbyn will say the government's welfare scheme is \"inhumane\" and a \"disaster\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10612/production/_108409076_rentgettyimages-619266472.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
