The 55-year-old Team Ineos principal, who led Britain\u2019s domination of cycling at the 2008 and 2012 Olympics, had surgery last month after the diagnosis in July.\n\nHe told the Times: \u201cThere\u2019s bound to be fear. It\u2019s the great unknown. I think I\u2019m resilient, tough. I can put up with a lot but in hospital one day I was overwhelmed, to be honest.\u201d\n\nVuelta a Espa\u00f1a: Primoz Roglic closes in on glory after stage 18 Read more\n\nBrailsford, who will find out on Saturday whether surgery was successful, continued: \u201cIt\u2019s easy to think: \u2018Why is it happening to me?\u2019 I\u2019ve worked hard on my health so you can get bitter, angry, frustrated. I had to learn to accept it. Talking about it among the team was a massive help.\u201d\n\nBrailsford, who has delivered seven Tour de France successes in the past eight years, says he has found a new appreciation for life: \u201cI work really hard, I charge around. Some might say I am obsessive. I can lose perspective and get very focused on small things. Now I just want to enjoy it more.\u201d\n\nChris Froome, meanwhile, is hoping to be back competing before the end of the year and has set his sights on Tour de France and Olympic glory in 2020.\n\nThe four-times Tour winner suffered a series of injuries in a high-speed crash before stage four of the Criterium du Dauphine in France in June.\n\nThe 34-year-old Team Ineos rider damaged his ribs, lung, neck, hip, elbow and leg when he ploughed into a wall at more than 33mph. He still cannot walk without crutches, although he is \u201cpartially\u201d load bearing, but has set his sights on a return to racing this year.\n\nHe told the Daily Telegraph: \u201cIt would be great to be able to do some of those post-season events that I typically do in the off-season. Just to get back into the pro scene again. It would be great if I could do something before January.\u201d\n\nA fifth Tour title remains in Froome\u2019s sights and he is also targeting gold at next year\u2019s Olympics.\n\nHe added: \u201cI\u2019m grateful to be alive. Now I\u2019ve got to give it everything. Both the TT and the road race in Tokyo look very appetising \u2026 it should be an extremely gruelling race. And coming a week after doing the Tour \u2013 assuming I\u2019m doing the Tour \u2013 it\u2019s almost perfect. I\u2019d like to throw my hat in the ring for both.\n\n\u201cAs for the Tour, going for a fifth title off what was potentially a career-ending crash \u2013 that would be even bigger. Loads of people came out after the crash and said: \u2019He\u2019s done, he\u2019ll never win another Tour.\u2019 They only spur me on.\u201d", "description": "The Team Ineos principal is to learn on Saturday whether surgery was successful and admitted: \u2018I can put up with a lot but in hospital one day I was overwhelmed\u2019", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d218443d1c803a6f8631947a884f2ecdfe84c8c8/9_493_2534_1520/master/2534.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bf008500b0944080c647d393d04b22d9", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
