He said 'I think this is a really bad idea'. He said you could get injured and what happens if the cut re-opens or if you get injured shoulders.\n\n\"If we lived our lives on 'what if' we would never do anything. These are once in a lifetime opportunities.\"", "description": "The Gypsy King was left sprawled on the mat holding his right ankle following the surprise assault", "authors": ["Alex Milne", "Image", "Wwe", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article20703302.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Injured-Fury.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
