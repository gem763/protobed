He said he didn\u2019t believe the agency had legal authority to grant deferred action in cases where it is not specifically called for in law. Medical emergencies are not among the areas defined in law.\n\nBased on that read, USCIS sent notices to about 400 migrants telling them their applications wouldn\u2019t be considered and they could be subject to deportation \u2014 meaning they could argue their cases to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nAfter an outcry from immigration activists, Mr. Cuccinelli relented and agreed to process the 400 cases in the pipeline, but he suggested his agency would grant no further approvals.\n\nMr. McAleenan on Wednesday ordered a full restart, though he stressed that cases would be scrutinized and approval would not be automatic. He also told USCIS to make sure its decisions are consistent and that deferred action \u201cis granted only based on compelling facts and circumstances.\u201d\n\nMr. McAleenan ordered Mr. Cuccinelli to update him on the progress in 30 days.\n\nRosemary Jenks, government relations manager at NumbersUSA, which advocates for stricter immigration limits, said Mr. McAleenan should have backed off.\n\n\u201cI find it disturbing that Secretary McAleenan, having come from a law enforcement agency, would be insisting that USCIS, a non-law-enforcement agency, exercise an authority that it clearly does not have,\u201d said Ms. Jenks. \u201cI would hope that the head of DHS would care more about following the law, even if it means he has to explain it.\u201d\n\nPolitico reported last week that the USCIS policy chief had written a memo laying out a number of options for Mr. McAleenan. They included stripping USCIS of all deferred action powers, as well as returning to the policy before the curtailment.\n\nUSCIS recommended taking away deferred action powers, but Mr. McAleenan went the other direction.\n\nHis office didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment Thursday, though the department did inform Congress that it had taken steps to return to the policy before Aug. 6, when USCIS curtailed the program.\n\nUSCIS said it was following through with Mr. McAleenan\u2019s new order.\n\n\u201cAt the direction of Acting Secretary McAleenan, USCIS is resuming its consideration of non-military deferred action requests on a discretionary, case-by-case basis, except as otherwise required by an applicable statute, regulation, or court order,\u201d the agency told The Times.\n\nImmigrant rights activists and Democrats on Capitol Hill had accused the administration of sending \u201csick kids\u201d back to their home countries to die. The House Oversight and Reform Committee held a hearing last week to give Democrats a chance to vent their anger.\n\nChairman Elijah E. Cummings, Maryland Democrat, claimed victory Thursday. He said his hearings forced the administration to retreat.\n\n\u201cIt should not take an emergency hearing by Congress \u2014 and threats for more \u2014 to force the Trump administration to do the right thing,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause of the secrecy and obstruction surrounding this policy, we will be taking additional steps to verify that these children and their families do not need to live in fear and uncertainty.\u201d\n\nDeferred action has become a controversial power for the Homeland Security Department. It is considered a prosecutorial decision not to pursue the punishment for an offense \u2014 in this case, not to pursue deportation for illegal immigrants who win their requests.\n\nIt had long been used in a small number of cases a year, but the Obama administration announced in 2012 that it was expanding deferred action to \u201cDreamers,\u201d creating a deportation amnesty for more than 800,000 illegal immigrants.\n\nUSCIS, now under the control of the Trump administration, said its power to issue deferred action is limited. The law calls for granting deferred action in cases involving victims of abuse or crimes, and for cases involving military families.\n\nBut the law does not envision deferred action in other cases such as medical needs, the agency says.\n\nUSCIS said decisions on deferred action beyond what is envisioned in the law should be made by ICE, the deportation agency within Homeland Security.\n\nMr. McAleenan, said it does appear the program has gone well beyond what was intended.\n\n\u201cI am committed to restoring integrity to the immigration system, particularly in areas of law that have been improperly interpreted in the past,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBut he suggested that USCIS moved too quickly: \u201cHowever, given the complexities and wide range of circumstances to which the law must be applied, it is also necessary and proper to maintain executive branch discretion \u2014 particularly where such discretion is appropriately and fairly exercised on a case-by-case basis.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
