The company expects full-year sales to grow as much as 5%, compared with earlier expectation of 4%. P&G retained its lower-end sales growth forecast of 3%.\n\nThe company also received a 0.4 percentage point sales boost from Japan, where retailers and shoppers hoarded beauty, household, baby and fabric care products and Baby businesses ahead of a planned VAT increase in October.\n\nOrganic sales, which exclude acquisitions, divestitures and currency effects, rose 7% in the company's fiscal first quarter, ended Sept. 30. P&G said organic sales rose 10% in its beauty business, which makes SK-II and Olay products. The company, which launched its Oral-B Genius X electric toothbrush and Crest toothpaste aimed at people with sensitive teeth and gums, said organic sales rose 9% at its healthcare business.\n\nOrganic sales in the grooming unit, a sore point for the company after it took a $8 billion writedown for its Gillette shaving business in the fourth quarter, reported 1% growth.\n\nChief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said in a post-earnings media call that P&G was trying to raise awareness about new Gillette products. Rivals like Unilever's <ULVR.L> Dollar Shave Club and Edgewell Personal Care's <EPC.N> Harry's have proven to be stiff competition in the shaving category.\n\nOverall, net sales climbed 6.6% to $17.80 billion, beating analysts' average estimate of $17.42 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Net income attributable to the company rose to $1.36 per share from $1.22 per share a year earlier. Excluding items, P&G earned $1.37 per share, beating estimates of $1.24.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Soundarya J in Bengaluru and Richa Naidu in Chicago; Editing by Bernard Orr and Steve Orlofsky)", "description": "P&G, which makes Tide detergent, Pampers diapers and Pantene shampoo, has been raising prices and investing in new products across most of its business, hoping to claw back market share from upstart brands that have cropped up in recent years.  \"P&G is clearly firing on all cylinders,\" Wells", "authors": ["Richa Naidu", "Soundarya J"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kMicCN6O5eM8X45jGJJPrQ--~B/aD01MzM7dz03OTk7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters.com/d7f830190f8b911402dac7a563c4e089", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
