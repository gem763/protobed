Icahn employs roughly 50 people in New York and more than half, including some of his lawyers and portfolio analysts, will move, the people said.\n\nNews of the move was first reported by the New York Post.\n\nIcahn did not return an email seeking comment.\n\nIcahn is the latest in a string of financial executives, including billionaire hedge fund managers Paul Tudor Jones and David Tepper, who are decamping from the Northeast for Florida which boasts lower taxes.\n\nBut for Icahn, who has pledged to give away at least half of his wealth by signing Warren Buffett and Bill Gates' Giving Pledge, the reason to move is more about lifestyle than taxes, someone who knows him said.\n\nAt an age when most people would have retired, Icahn is still working full days and pushing companies to perform better. He has long told associates that work exhilarates him and he has no plans to stop.\n\nWhile he gave up investing for outside clients eight years ago, his vast personal wealth, estimated at $17.5 billion, allows him to stay in the game, putting billions to work in companies like Caesars Entertainment which merged with Eldorado Resorts earlier this year. He is also complaining loudly about Occidental Petroleum's decision to buy Anadarko, mulling ways to influence the company more directly.\n\nBut life in New York, where he dines at favorite haunts like Il Tinello and works late hours at his Midtown office, was beginning to wear on him.\n\nSqueezing in an after-work tennis game, something he likes to do at his Florida home, is nearly impossible in New York. He was already spending more time in Florida during the colder months and is considering selling his New York City home, a person familiar with his thinking said.", "description": "Billionaire investor Carl Icahn is moving his office, more than half of his staff and himself to Florida early next year, people familiar with the plan.", "authors": ["Sam Meredith"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/103941252-20160913-9065-2269.jpg?v=1540214766", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
