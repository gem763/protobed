In addition to passing her PhD course, Kirby secured a grant through the Fulbright Program for research on urban agriculture - an achievement Libarkin thinks was possible because Kirby\u2019s proposals improved after each rejection.\n\nOn social media, people have praised Kirby for her positive, inspirational attitude and humour when it came to rejection.\n\n\u201cCongratulations! I\u2019m going through some difficult rejection stuff lately so I was glad to see this,\u201d one person wrote.\n\nAnother said: \u201cCongratulations and what an awesome way to flout failure.\u201d", "description": "A doctoral student openly\u00a0embraced the low points of her career during her dissertation defence by wearing a skirt made of the rejection letters she\u2019s received over the last five years.
