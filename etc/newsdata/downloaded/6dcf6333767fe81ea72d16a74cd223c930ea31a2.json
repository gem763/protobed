For example, when an audit issue is overdue, it is the person with direct responsibility for that matter who must front the board, rather than the head of audit.\n\nAs in many companies, the use of data and better analysis is also crucial. Stevens says Treleaven can now see, in close to real time, the way the risk of a default by a certain party could cascade through the ASX system.\n\nThe modernisation of the ASX technology stack that Stevens is overseeing clearly creates implementation risks, but should also result in better controls for the ASX over time.\n\nThe occasionally controversial blockchain-based system that ASX is developing to replace its core CHESS system for clearing in the cash equities market is a good example.\n\nStevens says it will drive big improvements in areas such as reliability, cyber security and recoverability. But as the RBA\u2019s assessment makes clear, the bank will be closely watching its rollout.\n\nThe CHESS replacement remains on track; the fourth of seven software \u201cdrops\u201d is imminent, with industry-wide testing likely to start in July 2020, ahead of the formal launch by April 2021.\n\nSteven says he\u2019s well aware the bar on risk is being raised. The challenge now for ASX is to embed its new processes and tools such that the organisation builds what he describes as \u201cmuscle memory\u201d.", "description": "Dominic Stevens says three years of heightened focus on risk management are helping underpin the group\u2019s broader push to set the market operator up for the next 20 years.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7936%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_56/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f807ee4ac5b83c4cc0fc9b9ebc7ddc6952a5ab71", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
