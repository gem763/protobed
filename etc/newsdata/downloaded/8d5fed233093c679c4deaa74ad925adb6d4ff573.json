In recent weeks, I\u2019ve been reading Dan Moren\u2019s latest book, The Bayern Agenda, which I\u2019d characterize as John le Carr\u00e9 meets Battlestar Galactica.\n\nIn it, Simon Kovalic is an intelligence agent for the Commonwealth of Independent Systems, which has been engaged in a sort of cold war with the Illyrican Empire. He was injured in the course of his last mission, and his covert team of operatives has been handed over to his ex-wife, Lieutenant Commander Natalie Taylor, for a mission to the banking planet Bayern Corporation. When he\u2019s tipped off that their cover might have been blown, it\u2019s up to him to go in and save them. The book is the perfect beach read for science fiction fans, with plenty of spy craft set against galactic intrigue. The book is set in the same world as his debut novel The Caledonian Gambit (although the two stand apart); a sequel, The Aleph Extraction, is due out next March.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for more books to check out this summer, here are 10 science fiction and fantasy novels hitting stores in the first half of August. Check back later for the next batch.\n\nAugust 6th\n\nCry Pilot by Joel Dane\n\nIn the distant future, Earth has been devastated by war and horrific bioweapons, and the remains of humanity live in corporate districts. Maseo Kaytu is a refugee from one of the war zones who\u2019s been trying to join the corporate military, but his past is making that difficult. He\u2019s given one chance to get in: volunteer as a \u201ccry pilot,\u201d someone who rides on a combatant-activated vehicle, a drone that helps protect human settlements. It\u2019s generally a suicide mission, but when he survives, he joins the military and bonds with his fellow trainees, working to keep his past a secret. Publishers Weekly says that the book is an \u201cintriguing, thoughtful exploration of what a corporatized future might look like, liberally peppered with scenes of military life.\u201d\n\nThe Dragon Republic by R.F. Kuang\n\nR.F. Kuang made a splash when she released her debut novel The Poppy War last year. That novel was one of our favorites, set in a fantasy world with a conflict inspired by the second Sino-Japanese War. The story follows a young woman named Rin who joins the Nikara Empire\u2019s elite military academy, the Sinegard, and soon discovers the horrors of war. She brings the conflict to an end, but at a terrible personal cost. In its sequel, The Dragon Republic, Rin is now on the run and seeking to murder the Empress who betrayed her country, while struggling with her addiction to opium and the commands of the Phoenix, a god who has incredible powers. Publishers Weekly says that \u201cKuang brings brilliance to this invigorating and complex military fantasy sequel.\u201d\n\nFirst Cosmic Velocity by Zach Powers\n\nIn this alternate take on the early days of the space race, the Soviet Union has sent five capsules into space and returned them to Earth \u2014 or so it seems. In reality, the mission\u2019s planners knew that they would be suicide missions, and concocted a plan to avoid losing face against the United States: they used identical twins, one of whom died in space, while the other pretended to have gone and returned. One of these twins, Leonid, has begun to question his role while on the press tour, and the ruse is close to being uncovered, because they\u2019ve run out of twins to send into space. Meanwhile, Premier Nikita Khrushchev has volunteered his prized dog for the next mission. Kirkus Reviews calls the book \u201ca lovely and hopeful story from a promising writer.\u201d\n\nAugust 13th\n\nRule of Capture by Christopher Brown\n\nIn 2017, Christopher Brown published his debut novel, Tropic of Kansas, a near-future thriller that explores how climate change and broken politics have created a dystopian wasteland, and which follows a pair of travelers as they make their way across the country. His second book, Rule of Capture, is a prequel set in the same world, and follows Donny Kimoe, a lawyer who defends people who are deemed enemies of the state. He\u2019s representing a filmmaker named Xelina Rocafuerte, who watched as a political opponent was assassinated, and is now accused of terrorism. Publishers Weekly gave the book a starred review, and says that \u201cinterpersonal drama fuels the story as much as legal maneuvering, and Brown keeps tight control of his narrative even as this alternate America slips its gears.\u201d\n\nThe Echo Chamber by Rhett J. Evans\n\nIn The Echo Chamber, Mike is a promising Silicon Valley engineer who watches as the company he works for launches an addicting social media platform that brings the country to the brink of collapse. He gets caught in a loop of his own memories, and is forced to watch society disintegrate around him over and over, until he comes across an actress who might hold the key to taking down the whole system.\n\nThe Golden Wolf by Linnea Hartsuyker\n\nLinnea Hartsuyker finishes out her Golden Wolf Saga (starting with The Half-Drowned King and The Sea Queen) with The Golden Wolf, which follows Harald, the king of Norway during the country\u2019s era of Viking exploration. In this finale, Ragnvald has helped support King Harald after having a vision in which he sees the king bring peace to the country. As their friends, family, and allies age and get ready to hand over the reins of power to a new generation, they face unexpected challenges and challengers that could undo everything they\u2019ve worked for. Kirkus Reviews says the book is \u201ca political whirlwind with adventure galore; Hartsuyker bows out on a high note.\u201d\n\nThe Gurkha and the Lord of Tuesday by Saad Z. Hossain\n\nA djinn king named Melek Ahmar awakens after millennia only to discover that the world he left has utterly changed. People have forgotten magic and instead have technology to fulfill their every whim. When he attempts to return to power and take over the city-state of Kathmandu, he finds that he has nothing to offer its citizens. He discovers only one unhappy person in the city, a former soldier and murderer named Bhan Gurung, who has secrets of his own that the djinn might be able to exploit, changing the city forever. Kirkus Reviews says, \u201cIn the space of this slim novel are elements of buddy comedy, thriller, sci-fi, fantasy, and philosophy. But somehow it all comes together in an entertainingly madcap story that asks what it means to be a citizen and what equality really looks like.\u201d\n\nThe Memory Police by Yoko Ogawa (translated by Stephen Snyder)\n\nJapanese author Yoko Ogawa\u2019s latest novel is set in a near future where society is watched by an oppressive state surveillance system. On an unnamed island, random objects are beginning to vanish \u2014 birds, hats, flowers, ribbons, and more. While most of the island\u2019s inhabitants don\u2019t notice, those who do live in fear of the Memory Police, a brutal organization that makes sure that those disappeared objects remain forgotten, searching homes and interrogating people. The book\u2019s unnamed narrator discovers that her editor is one of the people who can\u2019t forget, and she hides him in her home. Kirkus Reviews and Publishers Weekly each gave the book a starred review, with the latter saying that it\u2019s \u201ca quiet tale that considers the way small, human connections can disrupt the callous powers of authority.\u201d\n\nDo You Dream of Terra-Two? by Temi Oh\n\nSet in an alternate world where England developed its own space program, 10 astronauts travel to a distant planet in 2012, Terra-Two, which might become a new home world for humanity. Six of the astronauts are in their teens, and have trained for their entire lives for the mission. The voyage will take them 23 years, and there\u2019s no rescue in the event that things go wrong.\n\nPale Kings by Micah Yongo\n\nThe Five Lands have been at peace for three centuries, but that balance is beginning to fray around the edges, bringing war with it. In Micah Yongo\u2019s sequel to his 2018 novel Lost Gods, a young assassin named Neythan is summoned to S\u00fanam, expecting to be assigned a new target. Instead, he\u2019s confronted with secrets from a childhood that he\u2019s forgotten, linked to a scroll that he carries with him. As war looms, he begins to look into his past to find out about the secrets of the powers that he carries.", "description": "August\u2019s latest crop of books brings stories from authors like R.F.
