His mother, Margaret, was a director until 1998 and other family members have been directors at the travel agency over the years.\n\nHis wife, Irene, chairs the Sunderland-based business and owns the controlling stake of 50.1%\n\n'Tough ask'\n\nThe free insurance offer that nearly sank Hays Travel in its early years ended up propelling its growth. enabling it to open 10 stores by 1990.\n\nIt has expanded in the intervening years and now has 190 of its own stores - before taking on the 555 from Thomas Cook.\n\nMr Hays, who is managing director, acknowledges the deal will be a challenge.\n\n\"It's going to be a tough ask but it's very doable,\" he says.\n\nHe said he could succeed with the shops where Thomas Cook failed because Hays is an independent agent offering holidays from all operators.\n\nAlthough Hays has a big internet and social media profile, he said there was still a demand for personal service in shops.\n\nImage copyright Hays Travel Image caption Hays' independence means it sells a range of holidays such as swimming with pigs in the Bahamas\n\n\"We are pretty big already, and have a lot of buying power so our prices are competitive,\" he said.\n\n\"We didn't embark on this without giving it very serious thought.\"\n\nIn its last financial year, sales rose to \u00a3379m from \u00a3337.7m but pre-tax profit growth was flat at \u00a310m.\n\nMr Hays said: \"We do have the management and the capacity to do this. It's been endorsed by the Civil Aviation Authority. They've approved the plans that we've got.\"\n\nCommenting on whether the company will retain all 555 Thomas Cook shops and its 2,500 staff, Mrs Hays said: \"At this point in time we have no plans to close any of those and what we want to do is go into those shops and look at the opportunity. Categorically we're not going to go in and say 'this is absolutely a waste of time'.\"\n\n\"Obviously we are a commercial organisation, we will take a view. But as of today we have no plans to do that at all.\"\n\n'Family'\n\nThe family-run company prides itself on how it looks after its staff.\n\nThey received a bonus last year after the firm's total sales hit \u00a31bn and hundreds attended the firm's annual summer party held in the garden at Mr and Mrs Hays' home.\n\nAs the rescue of Thomas Cook's High Street stores was announced, Mrs Hays said the effect of the company's collapse on its employees was \"a tragedy\".\n\n\"Thomas Cook was a much-loved brand and a pillar of the UK and the global travel industry. We will build on the good things Thomas Cook had - not least its people - and that will put us in even better stead for the future.\"\n\n\"We've said many time before that travel in general in the UK is a relatively small industry and it's a family.\"", "description": "The Sunderland firm that began in the back of a childrenswear store is buying 555 Thomas Cook shops.", "authors": ["Dearbail Jordan", "Business Reporter"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/14736/production/_109166738_hays3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
