Got to start somewhere - well done @sainsburys.\u201d\n\nPet brand expert Rachel Spencer tweeted: \u201cThis is the best news ever. Every owner of an anxious dog or pet will be so thankful of this and I hope other supermarkets follow. Thank you from all the animals!\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nThe news was also welcomed by people suffering with PTSD.\n\nOn Twitter , one person commented: \"Great news. Fireworks serve no purpose, are dangerous to handle & cause incredible stress to wild life, pets, and a lot of people (especially those with PTSD). Not to mention the fact that they add to a lot of rubbish all over the place. Good decision.\"\n\nAnother said: \"Thank you SO much for your decision not to sell fireworks. Not only animals and wildlife but people suffering PTSD will benefit. I wish other retailers would follow your lead.\"\n\nVeterans mental health charity Combat Stress said: \"Bonfire night can be an especially difficult time for many combat veterans with mental health issues, with the loud bangs, bright lights and strong smells from fireworks causing serious anguish.\"\n\n(Image: Press Association)\n\nBut while pet owners are celebrating the move, the chain itself was cagier about its reasons.\n\nA Sainsbury\u2019s spokeswoman told the Mirror: \u201cFireworks are no longer available in our stores but customers can continue to choose from a range of seasonal products, such as glow sticks and light up spinning wands.\u201d\n\nWhile Sainsbury\u2019s has axed fireworks from stores, rivals Tesco and Asda said they were not following suit.\n\nA Tesco spokesperson said: \u201cWe are continuing to sell fireworks and there are no plans to change next year.\u201d", "description": "Pet owners are rejoicing, and animal charities exultant, after Sainsbury's decided to stop selling members of the public fireworks ahead of Bonfire Night", "authors": ["James Andrews", "Image", "Getty", "Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article9179356.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/GettyImages-147877902.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
