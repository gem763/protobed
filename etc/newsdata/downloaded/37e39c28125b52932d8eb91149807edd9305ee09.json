This protection applies even if the corporate whistle-blower discloses information that affects national security: surprisingly, there is no national security exception. Perhaps there should be.\n\nIf ASIC receives a whistle-blower report and fails to respond within three months (a very short period for regulatory action), the whistle-blower can disclose the information to a journalist, who is free to publish it with protection under the whistle-blower legislation for both the whistle-blower and the journalist.\n\nThe protections for whistle-blowers under these new laws are extensive, including protection of identity, protection from prosecution and protection from any other legal liability in relation to the disclosure. The disclosed information cannot be used in proceedings against the whistle-blower and\n\nthe whistle-blower is protected against any retribution by the employer that may be detrimental to the whistle-blower, including harassment, intimidation, harm, demotion or dismissal. A corporate employer can take no action in response to disclosure of confidential material.\n\nRisk of jail\n\nTherefore, private-sector employees now have extraordinary levels of protection that encourage them to blow the whistle anonymously on any matter that they \u201chave reasonable grounds to suspect concerns misconduct or an improper state of affairs or circumstances\u201d, which may include matters of national security, with an added right to disclose the information to a journalist if the regulator doesn\u2019t act within three months. But a public-sector employee of the same government that passed these laws has none of these rights and, to the contrary, could be jailed for blowing the whistle. Furthermore, a journalist who receives information from a public-sector employee can be accused of receiving stolen goods.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich leads us to the second issue. The ATO has recently won a High Court case against Glencore over the use of the Paradise Papers, stolen from a Bermudan law firm and received by the ATO.\n\nThere was no dispute that the documents were stolen. The case was about legal professional privilege but the effect of the decision is that the ATO is free to use stolen documents to review the affairs of a taxpayer.\n\nThe ATO has defended its claimed right, all the way to the High Court, to use documents that it knew were stolen, and yet the government alleges that a journalist has broken the law by receiving documents \u201cstolen\u201d by a whistle-blower.\n\nIs there a double standard here? One law for the government and another for the rest of us?\n\nThe government\u2019s response to issues of journalistic freedom has been to assert that no one is above the law, and that the rule of law must be observed. Those arguments lose force when the government\n\noperates under one law and applies a different law to the rest of us.\n\nThe writer is a partner of King & Wood Mallesons.
