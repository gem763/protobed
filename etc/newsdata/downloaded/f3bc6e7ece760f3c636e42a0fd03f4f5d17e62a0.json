That is the most any individual or organization spent in that period other than Trump, who spent $718,000.\n\nRead more: Trump and Republicans are pouring massive amounts of cash on Facebook anti-impeachment ads\n\nFor comparison, Democratic candidate Tom Steyer spent $86,000 on Facebook impeachment ads. Sen. Elizabeth Warren spent $20,000. No other Democratic candidate cracked the top 10 spenders.\n\nPenzeys Spices' position as an anti-Trump organization is, at first glance, an unexpected one. The spice brand has 65 locations, making it America's largest independent spice retailer, according to the New Yorker.\n\nPenzeys Spices CEO Bill Penzey has been a vocal critic of President Trump since his 2018 election. The New Yorker reported last year that, after Trump's election, Penzey sent an e-mail to customers saying: \"The open embrace of racism by the Republican Party in this election is now unleashing a wave of ugliness unseen in this country for decades.\"\n\nPenzey, who did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment, has continued to speak out against Trump.\n\n\"This week the curtain was finally pulled back on how deeply un-American the Republican Party has become,\" Penzey posted on the Penzey Spices' Facebook page last week. \"This week made clear the Republican Party's been hijacked by the one-two combo of unlimited political spending and foreign forces seeking to end the very concept of government of, by and for the people.\"\n\nPenzey Spices sells \"I Will Vote\" stickers on its website, as well as \"Embrace Hope\" magnets and \"V for Victory\" pins. Penzey has also created new anti-Trump recipes over the years, including Russian-style Tsardust Memories seasoning and a recipe for \"Pico Fruta Impeachment,\" made with Penzey's Pico Fruta seasoning and fresh peaches.\n\n\"Pico Fruta Impeachment. Clean, simple, and so right for our time,\" Penzey wrote on Facebook in 2017.\n\n\"For the recipe: slice ripe peaches, sprinkle with Pico Fruta to taste, share,\" Penzey continued. \"For the reality: in attacking the freedom of the press, the President has broken his oath of office to preserve, protect and defend the very First Amendment to the Constitution, the amendment the founders thought most important to a free nation.\"", "description": "Penzeys Spices \u2014 the largest independent spice company in the US \u2014 reportedly spent $92,000 on Facebook impeachment ads in a week.", "authors": ["Kate Taylor"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9e01fb122bd53bf06c4173?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
