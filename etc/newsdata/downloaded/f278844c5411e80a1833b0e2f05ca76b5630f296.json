Because sufficient progress was not made, LFS has decided it is in the best interests of all investors to seek to wind-up the WEIF rather than continue to reopen the fund.\n\nWhat does this mean if I\u2019m an investor in the WEIF?\n\nA fund winding-up means it will close and money will be returned to you. Returning money takes place in instalments as the assets in the fund are sold. LFS expects to make these as soon as possible once the formal winding-up begins, which is expected to commence in mid-January, because three months\u2019 notice needs to be given to investors under the rules implementing the applicable European Directive.\n\nWhat are the arrangements for the management of the fund\u2019s assets?\n\nLFS remains the authorised corporate director of the WEIF. This means it will be responsible for the orderly winding-up of the fund.\n\nWho will return my money to me?\n\nYou should receive money from any intermediary through which you invested in the fund (e.g. a platform provider or an adviser), or LFS directly.\n\nHow much of my money will I get back?\n\nThe amount you will receive will depend on the fund\u2019s value and the amount raised by selling the fund\u2019s assets. The fund\u2019s value fluctuates in line with the market values of its underlying assets. If assets are sold for lower prices, you will receive less from the winding-up process and this also may be less than you originally invested.", "description": "Here\u2019s more on the husband/wife team behind Hays Travel, the independent firm that has taken over the high street stores left empty after Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse:", "authors": ["Louis Ashworth", "Markets Reporter", "Russell Lynch", "Matthew Lynn", "Ben Marlow", "Juliet Samuel"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/business/2019/08/06/TELEMMGLPICT000200515655-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqaRL1kC4G7DT9ZsZm6Pe3PehAFAI_f6ud569StXyOKH0.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
