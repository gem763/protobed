England arrived at their Disneyland hotel on Monday, where they will spend the week preparing to face New Zealand in Saturday\u2019s World Cup semi-final, with their head coach insisting it does not require magic to beat the All Blacks.\n\nRather, a fast start and sticking to the task are the key planks of Jones\u2019s approach as England seek to inflict a first World Cup defeat on New Zealand for 12 years. He is not interested in Clive Woodward\u2019s attempts to bust the myth that surrounds their opponents \u2013 he famously banned his players from referring to them as the All Blacks \u2013 and when Jones was asked last autumn about how he would feel if the Twickenham crowd sang Swing Low, Sweet Chariot to drown out the haka, he replied: \u201cThey could be playing the Spice Girls and I wouldn\u2019t know, it\u2019s got no relevance to me at all.\u201d\n\nSuffice to say Jones is not interested in all the bells and whistles that accompany England versus New Zealand matches, let alone their first World Cup meeting with the All Blacks in 20 years.\n\nIf All Blacks can douse England\u2019s power, will Jones\u2019s men be able to react? | Nick Evans Read more\n\nJones lost his only match against New Zealand as England head coach but won five of his 11 when in charge of Australia, so he speaks from experience when he urges his side to respect the All Blacks but avoid the pitfall of doing so too much. He feels Ireland were guilty of that on Saturday and not for the first time turned to cricket to illustrate his point.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re bowling against Steve Smith, or you\u2019re bowing against Joe Root when he\u2019s in form, you\u2019ve got to be respectful of their ability,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there\u2019s a way to get a man out, there\u2019s a way to get them out, and the good bowlers are able to work them out and keep there, not go away from the plan, keep digging away.\n\n\u201cBut what happens is that people get bored and they try to find the magic solution and that magic solution allows that batsman to get free. If you allow them to get free they become a different player, but if you keep them where they don\u2019t like to be for long enough you\u2019ll get a result. It\u2019s the same in rugby.\u201d\n\nRespect is important to Jones. Jones loves nothing better than to joust with some opposing coaches in public but Hansen is not one of them. The pair get on well, are in regular contact, exchanged text messages when their semi-final was confirmed and, regardless of the result, they intend to share a beer after the match.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Eddie Jones and Steve Hansen (right) are interviewed at the World Cup draw in Kyoto in 2017.

Just look at his record \u2013 Super Rugby with the Crusaders when we started coaching against each other followed by Wales, followed by New Zealand. You don\u2019t get a better record than that.\n\n\u201cHaving a respectful relationship is important in the game. You just have to see this tournament what it\u2019s done. The things that happen in this tournament don\u2019t happen in other sports. You\u2019ve got the Canadian and Namibian blokes cleaning up the ground. Could you imagine Ronaldo or Messi doing that if Barcelona or Real Madrid gets a [game] washed out? It\u2019s a different game. And that\u2019s why relationships with players, coaches and fans is so important in our game.\u201d\n\nAn England-Wales final? Jones and Gatland have the knowhow to deliver it | Robert Kitson Read more\n\nHansen has been equally complimentary. Clearly he is aware of the threat posed by England, who inflicted his first defeat as All Blacks coach in 2012. There are no players in Jones\u2019s squad with experience of a World Cup semi-final \u2013 Hansen has 10 \u2013 but he believes England\u2019s disastrous campaign four years ago has made them a more formidable proposition.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a very good side,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve come to this tournament after being hurt at the last one and through that adversity \u2013 I think they\u2019re stronger because of it. They\u2019re desperate and they\u2019re well coached.\n\n'It\u2019s going to be a mighty clash and we\u2019re looking forward to it. You don\u2019t win 18 Test matches in a row without being a good team and the team that did that is basically the team he\u2019s got here.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s tinkered around with them and they\u2019re playing good footy so they\u2019ll be confident, as we will be.\u201d", "description": "New Zealand coach has called England a \u2018very good side\u2019 while Jones said his opposite number has \u2018a great record\u2019 before World Cup semi-final", "authors": ["Gerard Meagher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5205580c6a4710ee3a1b607b3ecd19faa4801066/0_0_5239_3143/master/5239.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7289bc0ca288363103f0d300ad1d0fde", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
