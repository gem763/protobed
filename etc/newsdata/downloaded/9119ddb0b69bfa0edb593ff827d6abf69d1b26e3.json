It could also provide a space to vacate hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees in Turkey that are increasingly proving a political burden on Mr Erdogan\u2019s ruling Justice and Development Party.\n\nBut the risks for Turkey are also many. From the Saudi intervention in Yemen, to the Iranian role in Iraq, to the United Arab Emirates and Egypt\u2019s backing for a warlord in Libya, the region is dotted with open-ended and expensive entanglements that end up backfiring.\n\nTurkey is already fighting a guerilla war against the separatist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in its own southeast provinces. Expanding the ground war into Syria against the PKK\u2019s allies risks sparking a separate insurgency. The Syrian Democratic Forces, the collection of Kurdish-led armed groups partnered with the US in its fight against Isis, said it was \u201cdetermined to defend our land at all costs\u201d against Turkey.\n\n\u201cWhat makes Turkey think they\u2019re not going to get caught in northern Syria fighting a protracted campaign?\u201d said Steven Cook, a Turkey and Middle East specialist at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nIn addition, an incursion into northern Syria could incur the wrath of Isis remnants, and puts them potentially in charge of thousands of jihadis now being held in prisons or at a displaced persons camp near the desert village of al-Hol.\n\n\u201cIf Turkey alone finds that there\u2019s a resurgent Isis that\u2019s too big to handle it could find itself in trouble,\u201d said Matthew Bryza, a former US diplomat and White House official.\n\nIn any military incursion, Turkey may run up against a narrow but poorly defined margin of action sketched out by US officials. Hours after Mr Trump gave the green light, US Senator Lindsay Graham unveiled legislation that would punish Turkey if it attacks Kurdish forces partnered with American troops.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Moscow, Ankara, and Tehran are jointly negotiating Syria\u2019s future, but remain wary of each other. While Russia and Iran support the regime of Bashar al-Assad, Turkey has long demanded he step down or share power with opposition groups it hosts.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re really exposed going deeper into Syrian territory,\u201d said Mr Cook. \u201cAnd they\u2019re not going to get any help. If Erdogan gets into trouble, the cavalry is not coming to the rescue.\u201d\n\nTurkish media outlets on Monday were filled with questions and worries about Mr Erdogan\u2019s plans. Will the US allow Turkey to use Syrian airspace over the Kurdish enclave, one security analyst wondered. What\u2019s the exit strategy?\n\n\u201cIsis is now our problem too,\u201d one leftist journalist warned on Twitter.\n\nWhat makes Turkey think they\u2019re not going to get caught in northern Syria fighting a protracted campaign? Steven Cook, Council on Foreign Relations\n\nTurkish officials counter such worries by pointing to relatively successful Syrian enclaves under their control in northern Aleppo province and the northwest Afrin district. Turkey has handed control of those regions to Syrian partners backed by the rebel Free Syrian Army. In addition, it partners each Syrian locale with a neighbouring Turkish municipality which provides basic services such as medicine and education.\n\n\u201cTurkey and the Syrian opposition have proved they can establish security and stability in Syria if there are no outside attacks,\u201d Omer Ozkizilcik, a Syria expert at the Turkish think tank SETA. \u201cThe previous operations in northern Aleppo and Afrin created environments that are relatively and at a low cost.\u201d\n\nMr Bryza suggested that only about a quarter of Syria\u2019s Kurds support the Kurdish-led administration in northeast Syria. Mr Ozkizilcik said that 500,000 Syrian Kurds are scattered throughout Turkey and Iraq, many of them eager to return home.\n\n\u201cIf the Turks do this with a generosity of heart that goes beyond their strategic calculus, it could be successful,\u201d said Mr Bryza.\n\nDespite the risks of an incursion, many Turks across the political spectrum generally support military action over the possibility of the Kurdish state led by a PKK offshoot taking deeper hold in northern Syria.\n\n\u201cThe other mess would be much worse,\u201d said Mr Ozkizilcik. \u201cThe situation on the ground now is a great threat to Turkish national security and even to its territorial integrity.\u201d", "description": "Turkey\u2019s political establishment appeared firmly behind a potentially risky military intervention into northern Syria after receiving the approval of the White House and a commitment to withdraw US troops from the Kurdish-run enclave.
