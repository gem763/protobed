But Brexit works in wonderful ways \u2013 and EU officials are not at all convinced, anyway, that the monologue in question, attributed to Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, is really aimed at them.\n\nOn Monday evening, shortly after the EU\u2019s comprehensive point-by-point deconstruction of the British proposals was published by the Guardian, the Spectator\u2019s political editor, James Forsyth, made public a text he had received from a \u201ccontact in Number 10\u201d on the state of play.\n\nThe Number 10 official admitted to Forsyth \u2013 who works with Cummings\u2019 wife, Mary Wakefield, at the Spectator \u2013 that the talks in Brussels would probably end this week as \u201c[Leo] Varadkar doesn\u2019t want to negotiate\u201d.\n\nBrexit weekly briefing: no end in sight despite Johnson's 'final offer' Read more\n\nIreland\u2019s prime minister was said to have \u201cgone back on his word\u201d by attacking the British government\u2019s proposals rather than shifting the EU\u2019s position in response to British moves on an all-Ireland regulatory zone for goods.\n\nVaradkar was said to be gambling on a second referendum, and was pulling the strings of the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier.\n\n\u201cAt the end of this week they may say: \u2018OK, let\u2019s do a Northern Ireland-only backstop with a time limit\u2019, which is what various players have been hinting at, then we\u2019ll say no, and that will probably be the end,\u201d Forsyth\u2019s Downing Street source wrote.\n\nThe text message\u2019s verbose author goes on to claim that the result would be one of two outcomes: a no deal on 31 October or a general election, in which the Conservative party morphs into the Brexit party, promising to deliver no deal.\n\nThe view in Brussels is that the message was not intended for EU consumption. In part that is because it is riddled with misunderstandings of how the EU works.\n\nIn securing the first outcome of a no-deal on 31 October, the writer appears to admit that there is no legal avenue to avoid the prime minister seeking an extension by 19 October.\n\nThe Downing Street source puts his faith in threats. Any member state who acquiesces to such an extension request will go to the \u201cback of the queue\u201d when it comes to future cooperation \u201cboth within and outside EU competences\u201d. A mysteriously-redacted threat over defence and security is also made.\n\nThe problem here is twofold: agreement on an extension will be done by unanimity. There won\u2019t be any member states to pick off. The lesson of the unlikely but steadfast unity of the EU27 on Brexit has not been learned. Perhaps he, or she, is new to the ball game?\n\nThe second mistake is to believe that threats over withdrawing security cooperation really have any impact. The UK is a member of Nato. Is Downing St threatening to undermine that multilateral institution too? The defence of Europe against external threats, including Russia, has always been seen as being in the national interest. Similar threats were made and retracted by Theresa May\u2019s government in 2017 given the pointlessness in making them.\n\nThe Downing Street source goes on to suggest that the UK will be a truculent and damaging member state if it remains in the EU beyond 31 October. \u201cEverything to do with \u2018duty of sincere cooperation\u2019 will be in the toilet,\u201d the Number 10 aide writes.\n\nUnfortunately, for the writer there is very little of great importance until June next year, when the EU\u2019s budget is likely to be put to a vote over which the UK could wield its veto. The UK has never been the easiest member state anyway. Should Johnson seek to frustrate the law of the land on agreeing and enacting the terms of the extension, he will be breaking it. The supreme court and the Scottish court of session has been clear.\n\nGiven that it is highly likely that much of this is appreciated in Downing Street, EU sources instead see the text message as yet another play in the blame game so central to Johnson\u2019s hopes of winning a majority in the now inevitable general election.\n\nIt is increasingly the view in Brussels that the legal text tabled by Johnson on the Irish border was written for rejection, and this text appears to prove it. It is time for Johnson to shout betrayal, and hope the voters believe him.", "description": "Text attributed to Dominic Cummings is riddled with misunderstandings of how EU works", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1ca73678c38d15c71585f8370d9be5af235a5d1/0_0_2365_1419/master/2365.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8be992128941874373b4b1eecf871d0e", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
