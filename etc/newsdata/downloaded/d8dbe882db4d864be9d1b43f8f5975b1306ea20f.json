Priced at $249 when it goes on sale (first in the US), the Lock is available now for preorder on Level\u2019s site.\n\nThere is a good chance that when the Lock does become generally available, you will be able to get it in more places beyond Level\u2019s site. Along with the launch of the Level Lock and the company itself, Level Home is also announcing that it has raised $71 million in funding since the company was first founded in 2016, with investors including a firm called Hut 8 Ventures (unclear if connected to Hut 8 cryptocurrency mining, I\u2019m asking), Lennar Homes \u2014 the home maker that has worked with the likes of Apple and Amazon to build in connected features into new properties \u2014 and Walmart.\n\nThe retail giant has been working double time to \u201clevel up\u201d to Amazon on the e-commerce front, building a range of services online and increasing the ways in which it can connect with shoppers beyond visits to its large retail locations, and while Level is not disclosing any details yet on how it will work with its strategic investors, you could imagine its involvement having more than one touchpoint.\n\nIt could be a very strong sales channel for the Level Lock through its many well-visited retail locations.\n\nBut it could also be sold potentially as part of a bigger service offering, in competition with something like Amazon Key, where Walmart offers smart locks to its customers as part of a bigger home delivery business. (Walmart has already started down this road: back in 2017 it first partnered with smart lock maker August to test in-home delivery.)\n\nPartnerships with the likes of Walmart and Lennar sound like a big deal, considering that the company hasn\u2019t tested its product or brand in the market, and the area of smart home hardware is also very crowded already.\n\nPart of the reason for the leap may be because of the background of the founders. John Martin (CEO) and Ken Goto (CTO) have worked together for decades across a range of major tech and other consumer companies including Microsoft, Starbucks and Apple. Very far from the image of young startup-guys, they are taking a measured and very confident approach to the bigger task of thinking about how to approach a new generation of hardware that isn\u2019t so much as \u201cdisrupting\u201d what is already being used, but is trying to augment it to bring in a wider population of adopters beyond those who embrace the cutting edge of tech.\n\n\u201cWe could have made anything for the connected home, so and we thought for weeks about what to invent,\u201d Martin told me about the pair\u2019s decision to focus first on the front door lock three years ago. \u201cWe had a couple of fundamentals: we wanted products for everyday life, and we didn\u2019t want home automation out of the mainline of what normally happens. We didn\u2019t want lightbulbs to change color for the sake of it, and we didn\u2019t want to appeal just to the tech professional. So we thought entry was the right point to start.\u201d Or, entry was a good point of entry, if you will.\n\nOf course, Level Home isn\u2019t the first to come on this progression of logic. Smart doors and smart locks are everywhere now, although ironically, they are not being used all that much. \u201cWhen we looked at first generation smart locks, we were offended by how aggressively the experience was departing from how people use locks today.\u201d By this, Martin is referring to things like physical keys, or aesthetically pleasing doors and locks without large objects attached to them.\n\nIndeed, the smart home market has not been a home run so far, but it shows some promise. The smart home market overall is projected to generate revenues of nearly $74 million this year, nearly doubling to $141 billion by 2023. A stream of hardware sales will underpin that growth, with some 140 million smart locks and other home security devices \u2014 the second-biggest category after video entertainment \u2014 expected to be shipped this year, growing to 352 million by 2023 globally.\n\nBut within that, penetration has not been massive: in Europe, only around 11 percent of homes have smart home devices in them (not counting phones), and in the US, the figure is only slightly higher, at 15%. That speaks to a still-nascent market, but also the fact that many people\u2019s imaginations, and crucially wallets, have get to be captured by what is on offer today.\n\nThat spells opportunity for the smart home entrepreneurs, and investors willing to take the leap to back them.\n\nMartin and Goto say that they have a pipeline of several other products that they will be working on, although for now, they are keeping quiet on what they might be. The basic idea will be to continue present an alternative version of the smart home: to quietly make our lives at home easier and more connected, but without any massively perceptible shifts. Move slow, don\u2019t break things.\n\nIn a market with a lot of options for how to bring more modern objects into the mix that genuinely look like the future, this could be a good differentiator.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pleased to make an investment in Level Home as they unveil their latest technology, the Level Lock,\u201d said Ashley Hubka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy, Development and Partnerships, Walmart, in a statement. \u201cSmart technology products and home automation provide us with more opportunities to serve customers in new ways today and into the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cLevel Home\u2019s unique approach and technology is a game changer for homebuilders,\u201d said Eric Feder, Managing General Partner, Lennar Ventures, in a statement. \u201cAs one of the nation\u2019s leading home builders, Lennar is founded on a long tradition of quality craftsmanship and attention to detail. The Level Lock will transform the smart lock category by allowing home builders to offer innovation without having to compromise on their home experience.\u201d", "description": "As companies like Google, Amazon and Apple hone their strategies to build the brain that helps you use the smart home of the future, where a new wave of internet-enabled appliances, climate and security systems and other connected objects can be connected and controlled through their hubs, a new smart home startup called Level Home [\u2026]", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screenshot-2019-10-15-at-09.36.39.png?w=718", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
