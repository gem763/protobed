He is still a valuable member and leader on this team. I can\u2019t wait to get him back, better than ever next year.\u201d\n\nThe 6-foot-9 junior redshirted the 2017-18 season after a knee injury that summer. He had a setback a year ago that required a second operation and kept him out of the first 12 games of the 2018-19 season. After returning to action in January, Curry hurt his foot and was limited to 15 games.\n\nIn 49 career games, the native of Memphis, Tennessee, who attended high school in Little Rock, Arkansas, has averaged 5.1 points, 4.6 rebounds and 19.6 minutes.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball coverage: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://apnews.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Minnesota forward Eric Curry has suffered another season-ending knee injury.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
