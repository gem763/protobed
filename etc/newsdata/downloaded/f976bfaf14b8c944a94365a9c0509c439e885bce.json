But that could all change because of a single tweet.\n\nDaryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, took to Twitter last week in support of the people of Hong Kong. While his single tweet on the matter wasn\u2019t necessarily controversial (he said \u201cFight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.\u201d), it was enough to prompt an immediate apology from the NBA and retaliation from China.\n\nThe owner of the Houston Rockets \u2013 which, by the way, is the most popular team in China thanks to the fact that native legend Yao Ming played his career there \u2013 quickly issued a tweet disavowing Morey\u2019s comments:\n\nListen\u2026.@dmorey does NOT speak for the @HoustonRockets. Our presence in Tokyo is all about the promotion of the @NBA internationally and we are NOT a political organization. @espn https://t.co/yNyQFtwTTi \u2014 Tilman Fertitta (@TilmanJFertitta) October 5, 2019\n\nThe NBA\u2019s statement reaffirmed that Morey was speaking for himself, not the company:\n\nStatement from NBA re: Daryl Morey\u2019s controversial tweet: pic.twitter.com/6IJv9FJF4T \u2014 Tim MacMahon (@espn_macmahon) October 7, 2019\n\nThis statement went over like a fart in church as the NBA found itself in the bipartisan cross-hairs of US political disgust, with pundits and politicians on both sides of the Trump divide weighing in to heap shame on the NBA.\n\nWe\u2019re better than this; human rights shouldn\u2019t be for sale & the NBA shouldn\u2019t be assisting Chinese communist censorship. \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) October 7, 2019\n\nThe only thing the NBA should be apologizing for is their blatant prioritization of profits over human rights. What an embarrassment. https://t.co/bbiwCBTwc1 \u2014 Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) October 7, 2019\n\nMorey, of course, issued a fast apology, claiming he\u2019d been educated on the many sides of the issue in the time since he first tweeted about Hong Kong:\n\n2/ I have always appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors have provided and I would hope that those who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them was not my intention. My tweets are my own and in no way represent the Rockets or the NBA. \u2014 Daryl Morey (@dmorey) October 7, 2019\n\nBut bells can\u2019t be unrung and tweets can\u2019t be untweeted (untwung?). The damage was already done. Adding insult to injury, the creators of Southpark waded into the fray after their show was banned (again) in China following the recent airing of an episode critical of the country\u2019s censorship policies. They threw shade at the NBA by way of a mock apology tweet:\n\nLike the NBA, we welcome the Chinese censors into our homes and into our hearts. We too love money more than freedom and democracy. Xi doesn\u2019t look like Winnie the Pooh at all. Tune into our 300th episode this Wednesday at 10! Long live the great Communist Party of China. May the autumn\u2019s sorghum harvest be bountiful. We good now China?\n\nChina doesn\u2019t seem to care what US politicians and entertainers think when it comes to the communist state\u2019s views on censorship. The PRC is threatening to tank its relationship with the NBA if the league doesn\u2019t straighten up, fly right, and get its executives and players in order.\n\nState-run media outlets won\u2019t run NBA preseason exhibition games as planned and technology giant Tencent has suspended NBA programming \u2013 a contract reportedly worth $1.5 billion \u2014 as it reviews its future plans with the league. While both state and corporate entities in China still claim they\u2019ll air regular season games as planned, the suspensions are obviously meant to have a chilling effect on the NBA\u2018s willingness to keep being the \u201cwokest league in sports.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s one thing when the mainstream media in the US praises the league for its anti-censorship efforts (something it stood to profit from), but when China\u2018s chips are on the table \u2013 and billions are at stake \u2013 the NBA appears to be showing its true color: green.\n\nRead next: Blizzard bans esports player from Hearthstone tourney over Hong Kong support", "description": "", "authors": ["Tristan Greene"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F06%2FTwitter-China-hed.jpg&signature=03483e706e4af6265e04db4cbd4772ae", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
