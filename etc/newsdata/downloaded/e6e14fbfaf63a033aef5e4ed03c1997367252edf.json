(Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nAmid a groundswell of support for impeachment proceedings among House Democrats, a new poll finds a majority of Americans do not favor ousting President Trump from office.\n\nThirty-seven percent of voters say that Trump should be impeached and removed from office, while 57 percent say he should not be impeached, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday morning.\n\nThe poll was conducted from Thursday through Monday, as details were emerging about Trump\u2019s July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump acknowledged he asked Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son.\n\nThat revelation prompted a rush of moderate House Democrats to call for an impeachment inquiry into Trump, a step they had resisted for months. On Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced the launch of official proceedings, accusing Trump of violating the Constitution in seeking help from a foreign leader to damage a political opponent.\n\n[Pelosi announces impeachment inquiry, says Trump\u2019s courting of foreign political help is a \u2018betrayal of national security\u2019]\n\nThe poll shows a stark partisan divide on the question of impeachment. Among Democrats, 73 percent support impeachment, while 21 percent are opposed. Among Republicans, only 4 percent support impeachment, while 95 percent are opposed.\n\nTrump\u2019s overall job approval rating remains in the range it has for nearly his entire presidency, with 40 percent of voters approving of how he is handling his job, and 55 percent saying they disapprove.\n\nThe poll shows Trump remains popular among Republicans and faces no significant threat from his three GOP primary challengers. Among Republican voters, he has 80 percent support, while none of the three challengers has more than 2 percent.\n\nMoreover, 67 percent of those voters say they would be very satisfied with Trump as the Republican nominee for 2020, and 17 percent say they would be somewhat satisfied.\n\nThe poll is said to have a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points.", "description": "The Quinnipiac University survey was conducted as details were emerging about the president\u2019s controversial call with the leader of Ukraine.", "authors": ["John Wagner", "National Reporter Leading The Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/tCxzbvXCGsRuCBaWhY8lsRnpr84=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GSGM64G7P4I6TMMZ6Y4L6LBUB4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
