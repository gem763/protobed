Here's everything we know about the candidate and how he stacks up against the competition.", "language": "en", "text": "Who is Donald Trump?\n\nCurrent job: President of the United States.\n\nAge: 72\n\nFamily: Trump and his wife Melania have been married since 2005. They have a 13-year-old son named Barron. Trump also has four other children \u2014 Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka, Eric, and Tiffany \u2014 from his previous marriages to Ivana Trump and Marla Maples. Trump has nine grandchildren.\n\nHometown: Queens, New York\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nPrevious jobs: Real-estate developer, head of the Trump Organization, host of NBC's \"The Apprentice.\"\n\nWho is Donald Trump's direct competition?\n\nDonald Trump will have to undergo a primary, but for now his primary-tier competition is decidedly ambiguous. Trump has his work cut out for him in the sense that he's got to bring the party together behind him despite an appetite from some Republicans for an alternative.\n\nOne INSIDER survey from earlier this year found that while 33% of those who identified as at least slightly conservative backed the president fully and wouldn't consider voting for any challenger, 24% would prefer to back a qualified GOP challenger and 18% would be open to other GOP contenders.\n\nWhat are Donald Trump's policy positions?\n\nWhat are Donald Trump's political successes?\n\nTrump is the first person to be elected president with no military, legal, or political background.\n\nHis trade policy faces significant criticism, but Trump has also been praised for forcing China to come to the negotiating table.\n\nTrump's focus on bringing manufacturing jobs back to the US resulted in the manufacturing sector adding employment at a faster pace than the rest of the economy over the last two years.\n\nIn 2018, Trump worked with Congress to pass the SUPPORT Act, which the White House touted as \"the single largest legislative package addressing a single drug crisis in history.\"\n\nHow much money has Donald Trump raised?\n\nTrump and the Republican National Committee raised a gargantuan $105 million in the second quarter of 2019, signaling that his war chest will be significantly more packed this time around than in 2016. Trump has raised more money than any Democratic presidential nominee, and according to The New York Times, he outraised former president Barack Obama in the equivalent period during his 2012 re-election campaign.\n\nCould President Trump beat the Democratic nominee?\n\nAbsolutely. Polling consistently demonstrates that the 2020 election will be close, and while the quality of the polling at this stage in the cycle is spotty at best, Donald Trump performs well against a variety of Democratic contenders.\n\nDespite a strong economy, the president has had difficulty getting above water when it comes to his personal approval rating. This presents a favorable playing field, if a weaker candidate than normal under these conditions.\n\nRealistically, if there's a major Democratic contender you can find a poll of Trump beating them and another poll of them beating Trump. At this point in the cycle what makes the most sense it to look at how well Democratic candidates are assembling a coalition that could put them over the top.\n\nRead more of our stories on President Donald Trump:", "description": "The 45th president's reelection campaign already has $40.8 million in the bank \u2014 more than any of the 2020 Democratic contenders have reported so far.", "authors": ["Sonam Sheth"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5cb8983916c65a1903704d02?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-07-29"}
