I think you're a beautiful man.'\n\nBut the funnyman admitted he was unfazed by the comments, because he agrees with them.\n\nAdmission: The former MTV host also went on to reveal that she felt 'alone' while coming to terms with what she had been through (pictured in August 2019)\n\n'I don't mind it, because it just means I've done better haven't I?' he said.
