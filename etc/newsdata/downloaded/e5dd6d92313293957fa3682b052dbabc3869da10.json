And the four front players were a bit flat in the first half.\n\n\"And after we conceded two goals it became very difficult. In the end we showed character and maturity and we had time maybe to win the game but I had to congratulate the players for getting a point after what had happened in the first half.\"", "description": "Championship leaders West Bromwich Albion again demonstrated their capacity for coming from behind to salvage a point against bottom-of-the-table Barnsley.", "authors": ["Jon Culley", "Sam Dean", "Ipek Tugcu"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/22/TELEMMGLPICT000213819607-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwRMWbYwzrg_3PLcMwCu9G8U.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
