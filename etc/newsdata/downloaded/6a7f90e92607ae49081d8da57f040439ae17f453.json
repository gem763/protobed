What will I say to the press, what will I say on the TV? You're thinking of those potential scenarios.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\n\u201cBut I'm very proud of our players because they never give up even when they're under a bit of pressure. They keep fighting and finding a way to get a result.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited about where we are \u2013 the semi-final of a World Cup. Alun Wyn Jones said it's 240 minutes to do something you'll remember for the rest of your life. We're down to 160 now.\n\n\u201cIf you can't get excited about that then nothing will excite you.\u201d\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nWales were outplayed for more than an hour, with rampant France helping themselves to three tries.\n\nBut they imploded on 49 minutes with giant lock Sebastien Vahaamahina given his marching orders for planting an elbow to the face of man of the match Aaron Wainwright.\n\nIt was a role reversal from the World Cup semi-final between the nations eight years ago when Sam Warburton was sent off and France won by a single point.\n\nGatland added: \u201cWe didn't play our best but we showed great character and that's testament to this group of men. Now we can look forward to the semi-final.\"", "description": "\u201cWe\u2019re excited about where we are \u2013 the semi-final of a World Cup.
