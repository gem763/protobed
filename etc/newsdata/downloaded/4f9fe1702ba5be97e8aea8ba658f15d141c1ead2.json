Our real solution is top secret and totally brilliant and everyone will like it.\n\nWhat he said: But clearly, this is the moment when the rubber hits the road.

I pride myself on my inventive use of language, but I\u2019ve got a lot of these interviews to get through.\n\nWhat he said: We\u2019ve made a very good offer \u2013 we\u2019re going to make a very good offer.\n\nWhat he meant: The offer that we have made, which has been rubbished by the Irish and the rest of the EU, that wasn\u2019t really our offer. They didn\u2019t like that one, so my people are going to have to rewrite it overnight tonight and pretend it is completely different.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Things can get confused. People can needlessly distort what we\u2019re proposing.\n\nWhat he meant: You see my problem? Every time I put something down in writing, even if the clever civil service people suggest we call it a \u201cnon-paper\u201d, these Irish people say they don\u2019t like it and leak it to you journalists and that makes it all very difficult.\n\nWhat he said: We do think there\u2019s a good solution. We hope that our European EU friends in Brussels, in Dublin, in Germany, will want to take it forward.\n\nWhat he meant: I do hope that some brainy official will come up with a clever wheeze jolly soon because we haven\u2019t got much time.\n\nWhat he said: You wanted detail; I could talk about cheese.\n\nWhat he meant: I am going to take refuge in the small print of sanitary and phytosanitary regulations, because Dan Walker [BBC Breakfast presenter] has complained that I\u2019m filling the time by talking about cattle. That means I must be near the end of this slot. There is light at the end of the tunnel. The sunlit uplands of the next interview beckon.\n\nWhat the prime minister said on the BBC Today programme: I would like to veil our proposals in decent obscurity until we share them with our European friends.\n\nWhat he meant: I have not thought of a solution to the Irish border problem in the 10 minutes since my last interview.\n\nWhat he said: We\u2019ve made progress since the beginning of August, a great deal of progress with our friends.\n\nWhat he meant: We are going backwards, slowly.\n\nWhat he said: We are working flat out to get a deal, and believe me I want to get a deal.\n\nWhat he meant: The prospects of a deal are receding.\n\nWhat he said: There is a natural limit to the ability of a sovereign state to compromise on things like the customs territory.\n\nWhat he meant: Please, Angela, Emmanuel and Leo, help me out here.\n\nWhat he said: We haven\u2019t made any such request [that EU leaders should refuse to give us a Brexit extension]. But they want to get this done as much as we do.\n\nWhat he meant: I am hoping that my fellow EU leaders will rescue me from this hole. If they refuse an extension, the UK parliament will vote for any old rubbishy deal to avoid a no-deal Brexit.\n\nWhat he said: I disagree with some people in my family about the direction that we\u2019re going in, in relation to the EU.\n\nWhat he meant: My brother and sister have always been aggravating.\n\nWhat he said: Forgive me if I appear stubborn.\n\nWhat he meant: Thank you very much, Nick Robinson, for asking me if I\u2019m going to change. The focus groups say they like my single-minded determination and sense of purpose.\n\nWhat he said to Nick Ferrari on LBC: A lot of this is being generated by the current mayor of London who seems to have a lot of press officers.\n\nWhat he meant: Allow me to deflect a question about my relationship with Jennifer Arcuri. Let me suggest that the claim that I broke the rules on conflicts of interest came from my political opponents \u2013 and let\u2019s face it Sadiq Khan is more of a threat to me than Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nWhat he said: What has happened to Crossrail, which I left in good order? What has happened to knife crime?\n\nWhat he meant: Bluff, bluster and politics.\n\nWhat he said: I don\u2019t comment on private conversations.\n\nWhat he meant: But I am sufficiently annoyed by the idea that Carrie Symonds told me to tone down my language that if you persist I will change my mind and deny that she did.\n\nWhat he said: I think there is a concerted effort now to frustrate Brexit. I think that\u2019s a mistake. I think it would be very sad for democracy if that were to happen.\n\nWhat he meant: It would be very sad for me if I turn out to be the shortest serving prime minister in British history.", "description": "What Boris Johnson said on BBC Breakfast: First of all, from what I\u2019ve seen of the response in Brussels and I think Dublin, they\u2019re not talking about the proposals that we are actually going to be tabling \u2013 this is some stuff that went previously.
