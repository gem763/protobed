Thomas Chatterton Williams says yes", "language": "en", "text": "The author and critic discusses why we should move away from race categories defined \u2018using plantation logic\u2019 \u2013 and suggests \u2018retiring from race\u2019\n\nThe American writer Thomas Chatterton Williams is racially ambiguous enough to be mistaken as Algerian in Paris, where he and his French wife are raising two children, their heads capped with airy blond curls.\n\nThere is a crisis on campuses \u2013 but it\u2019s about racism, not free speech | Nesrine Malik Read more\n\nIt was the birth of his older child, Marlow, six years ago, that set off an instant panic in him. She can pass for Swedish, he says. So what did it mean that he, then a self-identified black man who had always accepted the black/white binary, had a child who would be perceived as white?\n\nIt meant, at first, he would apply camera filters to darken her skin \u2013 to make her belong, to him and to a race. Eventually, it meant asking questions complex enough to alter how he identifies himself now: what does it mean to belong to a race, part of which for black people can include \u201can allegiance to pain\u201d? And why would passing that down to his daughter make her black?\n\nIn his second book, out Tuesday, Self-Portrait in Black and White, he calls for us to consider why we uphold race categories defined \u201cusing plantation logic\u201d and encourages us to do away with the arbitrary nomenclature altogether. Not to be confused with the term \u201cpost-race\u201d, he suggests \u201cretiring from race\u201d, \u201ctranscending race\u201d, \u201cunlearning race\u201d. It\u2019s a big ask, he admits.\n\nBecause both of us are mixed-race people who grew up with one black parent and one white parent, Chatterton Williams thinks he and I have a head start on dismissing the barriers of race. We both remember the first time we were \u201craced\u201d by a stranger and simultaneously separated from our white parent, and setting out from then on to continually contemplate race in our respective lives. For him, this has come to mean examining the artificiality of it.\n\nOn the campus of Bard College, a private arts college upstate New York where he taught a four-week course, Can we retire from race?, this fall, we discussed the privilege of proximity to whiteness, whether it is asking too much of black people to let go of race while retaining the pride of an identity forged in the face of systematic oppression and, finally, why he\u2019s optimistic norms can change.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nSummer Sewell: After six years of examining race categories, you\u2019ve come to identify as an ex-black man. If you\u2019re ex-black, what are you now?\n\nThomas Chatterton Williams: I try to find more specific ways of identifying myself . So I would say I\u2019m American. I\u2019m descended from southern slaves, and I\u2019m descended on my mother\u2019s side from northern European Protestant immigrants. I don\u2019t mean that I\u2019m a white man.\n\nRight. You say you didn\u2019t become ex-black because you\u2019d ceased loving what I\u2019ve been taught to call \u2018black\u2019, or because you wished for your daughter to blend in to what you\u2019d been taught to call \u2018white\u2019. You don\u2019t want to push her into identifying as white, obviously.\n\nThat would be the worst-case scenario. If she just walked around as a kind of entitled white girl, that would be a failure: a parental failure, a family-wide failure.\n\nYou say you can reject those terms because they don\u2019t fully encapsulate who you and your daughter are as people. But don\u2019t we already know that?\n\nNo. Not everybody.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m mixed or because I think about race so much, but when people say that they\u2019re black, I don\u2019t just attribute traits to them.\n\nI think that you and I would be probably outside of the norm.\n\nOver the course of writing the book, and also while doing a long reported piece for the New Yorker and interviewing some real racists, I really moved away from the, \u201cOh God. What have I done? I\u2019ve killed the blackness in my family,\u201d and more to, \u201cThis is fucked up. We\u2019re not going to solve that.\u201d\n\nIt was really talking with the racists that I realized we\u2019re not going to actually transcend racism so long as we believe in these categories. So long as those categories are upheld, whether it\u2019s by the right or the left, there are people that draw conclusions that you, Summer, don\u2019t draw from these categories.\n\nDo you think that lighter-skinned black people, and especially mixed people like us, have some privilege in even entertaining the idea of \u201cunlearning race\u201d? Wouldn\u2019t it be harder for darker-skinned black people?\n\nI think it\u2019s easier for people who are mixed or ambiguous in some way, but I was really inspired by this guy, Kmele Foster, who calls himself a race abolitionist. He would say that he\u2019s a bunch of different things \u2026 He\u2019s very dark-skinned, and he just refuses to identify with the term \u201cblack\u201d. He thinks it\u2019s unhelpful. I agree with him on that and some people do laugh at him about it, he has this kind of confidence about him that I think is maybe a big ask for a lot of people.\n\nYou have a bit of history with Ta-Nehisi Coates \u2026\n\nI\u2019ve written a lot about him.\n\nAnd you\u2019ve said that he pushes white supremacy.\n\nNo, he doesn\u2019t push it, but I think that he sees whiteness as special, which I think actually reinforces some of the very things that I know he wants to counteract. So what I mean by that is, white supremacists also think they\u2019re special. They don\u2019t disagree. And Coates is also ambivalent and contradictory about whether blackness is an essence or whether it\u2019s fake.\n\nIn his book Between the World and Me, there\u2019s this passage: \u2018Perhaps being named \u2018black\u2019 was just someone\u2019s name for being at the bottom \u2026 There was no nobility in falling, in being bound, in living oppressed, and there was no inherent meaning in black blood.\u2019 That all sounds similar to what you\u2019re talking about.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what I would say. But he has it kind of both ways. In his critique of Kanye West, I thought that he got into basically saying that Kanye West is an inauthentic, artificial black man ... that he had lost some blackness, which I think is a very dangerous thing to say because it\u2019s basically saying \u2026\n\nThere\u2019s a certain way to be black.\n\nYeah. And that there are people who will decide that and judge that.\n\nYou also say in your book that Coates has a pessimistic view. You describe a scene from his book where a white woman pushes his son and he reacts, people may say, aggressively, and is like, \u2018This is blatantly racist and \u2026 \u2019\n\nAnd he said he brought centuries of history into the encounter.\n\nYeah. You write he overreacted and made no room for it to be just this crazy woman who had a bad day. That\u2019s all his pessimism, right? So then is your unlearning race idea optimistic?\n\nI think you have to be an optimist. I want to say that I\u2019m almost paraphrasing James Baldwin verbatim to say that you have no choice but to be an optimist, so long as you\u2019re alive and you\u2019re writing and you\u2019re trying to have a better world. And as a parent, I would say that I have no choice but to be an optimist. I use the word naive in the book. I think that children have a way of thinking about race that is much healthier. If I asked Marlow to describe you, she will be like, \u201cSummer\u2019s wearing a beige jacket. That\u2019s the main difference between her and the girl in the pink shirt,\u201d literally.\n\nA black woman was shot and killed by police in her house. We need real justice | Derecka Purnell Read more\n\nI think that I would like to reclaim some of that naivety and I have to be optimistic to believe that the world could be otherwise. If I were pessimistic, I don\u2019t see how I could write. You know? Because you have to believe that you\u2019re reaching somebody.\n\nYou write in the book that when you see your white friends post on Facebook that they\u2019re sorry that they\u2019re white ...\n\nYeah. Atoning for it.\n\nDo white people have to do this atoning either in a performative way or real way for us to move past race?\n\nWhite people have basically been encouraged for most of recent history in America to think of themselves as outside of race. White people do have race. They need to understand how their race has been constructed as artificially as everybody else\u2019s.\n\nBlack people have always been in race. We\u2019ve never been outside of it, but it\u2019s not a black subject. That\u2019s why I get frustrated when people ask, \u201cWho would you like to speak about [your book] with on the panel? Who should review it?\u201d It\u2019s like, this is not a black book. It\u2019s not not a black book. I\u2019m talking about a lot of black stuff in here, but I should be talking about this with Asian people, I should be able to have a Latino interlocutor, I should be able to have a white interlocutor because this is not a subject that only people of color are supposed to be talking about while whites are just in the audience.\n\nWho I want to be talking about this with is anybody whose race has been made in America, which is all people.\n\nYou used a metaphor in the book about a woman who gets hit by a car and, no matter what the driver can do to help, pay her medical bills or whatever, it\u2019s up to her to heal herself. Is that what black people have to do to unlearn race?\n\nI think that unlearning race for black people is more along the lines of seriously saying blackness isn\u2019t real, race isn\u2019t real. I\u2019ve been socially deemed black in America, and this is a category that\u2019s been hurting my family for generations and that has also led to extraordinary cultural contributions that I\u2019m very proud of, but it\u2019s not a real category and our society is damaged by insisting on it.\n\nHow do we hold on to these contributions that the world would be so much more boring, among other things, if it weren\u2019t for black people? How do we hold on to those and also let go of our race?\n\nI think I do it every day. I still go home and I\u2019ll listen to Gunna or Lil Baby and that\u2019ll feel culturally relevant to me. I\u2019ll listen to John Coltrane. I\u2019ll see something that\u2019s familiar to me in even black British writer like Zadie Smith or I\u2019ll look at Kerry James Marshall paintings and I\u2019ll notice his blackness there, but I don\u2019t think I have to believe it\u2019s a biological reality. There was a community of people that went through certain experiences and circumstances over the course of a period of time in the new world and they created cultural traditions that many people who look like them upheld.\n\nWhat do you think is the main criticism you\u2019re going to get from the book, and from black people, specifically?\n\nThe worst criticism would be silence, which is an absolute nightmare when you work so hard and think so seriously about a question. When people won\u2019t touch it, that\u2019s the writer\u2019s fear.\n\nBut I think that a criticism, I\u2019m sure, will come my way and it\u2019s probably the black criticism. People think that I married into whiteness and now live comfortably in Paris and don\u2019t interact with black problems, even though reality is always more complicated than how it seems. I\u2019ve seen it in the comments of the New York Times excerpt of the book, because there\u2019s pictures of me and my family, and commenters were like, \u201cHis kids are white and he\u2019s a very light-skinned black man with a white wife. He made the decision to have a white wife.\u201d There\u2019s a kind of dismissiveness that, I think, doesn\u2019t take seriously what I\u2019m trying to work at.\n\nIf I were writing this book, my worry would be, \u2018They\u2019re going to think I\u2019m a sellout. They\u2019re going to think I\u2019m giving white people a pass by just saying, \u201cFuck all that. Let\u2019s just move past all of this.\u201d\u2019\n\nYeah. I mean, I mention it a bit in the book. I try to make this point \u2026 If you\u2019re at an impasse when you\u2019re trying to get by somebody and then you both keep moving, somebody\u2019s got to move first or not move first. Somebody\u2019s got to stop and so the other person goes around.\n\nI think we\u2019re at a kind of impasse that we are obsessed with. We\u2019re really looking backward. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong to look backward, but I\u2019m also trying to look forward and imagine another way. And maybe, it\u2019s another wrinkle in the story of blacks in America. Black people are also the people that will ...\n\nForgive.\n\nYeah. Maybe that\u2019s not fair and I would still ask that if that was the case, because I think that the reward for everyone, including blacks. I don\u2019t think this idea that white people get rewarded, too, ruins the prize of a better future, if black people also get the better future. You know what I mean? I\u2019m not just into keeping white people on the hook and retribution. Should there be some reparation? Probably. Has there been some reparation? For some blacks, there has been reparation. Does there need to be more? I thought that the most convincing and really spectacular piece of writing was Ta-Nehisi Coates, The Case for Reparations.\n\nIt\u2019s the definitive piece, yeah.\n\nI love that piece. I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s contradictory to wanting to get past, too, and to losing the pessimism. I think that white people are going to have to do a hell of a lot, but if black people show leadership on this issue, it almost seems like it might be fitting. And people will be like, \u201cWell, yeah. But we\u2019re not here to do the labor or to teach you to do your work,\u201d but what are you here for? We want a better world. What are you here for? I think that\u2019s very admirable work, actually.
