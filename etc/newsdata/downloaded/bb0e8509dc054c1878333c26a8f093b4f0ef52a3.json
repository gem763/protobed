We will always be brothers.\n\n\u201cWe are certainly on different paths at the moment but I will always be there for him as I know he will always be there for me.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see each other as much as we used to because we are so busy but I love him dearly.\n\n\u201cThe majority of the stuff is created out of nothing but as brothers, you know, you have good days, you have bad days.\u201d\n\nWilliam and Harry\u2019s close bond was cemented in the aftermath of their mother Diana, princess of Wales\u2019s shock death aged 36 in a 1997 Paris car crash during a paparazzi pursuit.\n\nBut while William is one day destined for the throne, Harry \u2014 sixth in line and now with his own wife and baby \u2014 has begun to strike out on his own.\n\nThis year the brothers split their joint offices and charitable foundation and no longer live in close proximity.\n\nHarry and Meghan married in May 2018 and their son Archie Mountbatten-Windsor was born in May this year.\n\n\u2013 Press pressure \u2013\n\nMeghan, who has also been rumoured to have feuded with William\u2019s wife Kate, said her British friends had warned her not to marry Harry.\n\n\u201cThe British tabloids will destroy your life,\u201d she said they told her.\n\nFormer US actress Meghan, 38, has faced an increasingly hostile press, with the tabloids luxuriating in stories about her fractured family and rumoured palace rifts.\n\nThe couple launched legal action this month against British tabloid The Mail on Sunday for alleged invasion of privacy over a letter to her father. It came with a stinging statement from Harry about general tabloid coverage.\n\nHarry is also suing two newspaper groups over alleged voicemail interception, or phone hacking.\n\nAsked if Meghan was facing the same media pressures as Diana, Harry replied: \u201cI have a family to protect.\n\n\u201cI will not be bullied into playing a game that killed my mum.\u201d\n\nMeghan said she had tried to adopt a British \u201cstiff upper lip\u201d but thinks it is internally \u201creally damaging\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not enough to just survive something, that\u2019s not the point of life. You have got to thrive.\u201d\n\nAsked if she was \u201cnot really OK\u201d and life had \u201creally been a struggle\u201d, she replied simply: \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile Harry, who has been open about his own past mental health struggles emanating from Diana\u2019s death, said: \u201cIt\u2019s constant management. I thought I was out of the woods, and then suddenly it all came back.\u201d\n\nThe couple are going to take six weeks off work.\n\n\u2013 Life in Africa? \u2013\n\nDuring the interview, Harry said that he would like to live in Africa but finding the right place would be difficult.\n\nHis grandmother Queen Elizabeth II is the head of the Commonwealth and made Harry her youth ambassador for the 53-country grouping, which includes 19 African states.\n\n\u201cThe rest of our lives\u2019 work will be predominantly focused on Africa, on conservation,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where we could live in Africa at the moment.\n\n\u201cWe have just come from Cape Town \u2014 that would be an amazing place to be able to base ourselves, of course it would, but with all the problems that are going on there, I just don\u2019t see how we would be able to really make as much difference as we want to.\u201d", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 Britain\u2019s Prince Harry said he and his brother Prince William were on \u201cdifferent paths\u201d and admitted occasional", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/21/ae0ac2_year-brothers-split-joint-offices-charitable-foundation-no-longer-live-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
