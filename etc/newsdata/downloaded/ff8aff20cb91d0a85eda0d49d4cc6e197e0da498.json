He was scheduled for a detention hearing Tuesday and his lawyer, Michael Areinoff, said he had no immediate comment about the case.\n\nThe documents did not list a cause of death for the boy, who was identified only by the initials G.B. But doctors said the boy suffered burns on his head, elbows and forearms.\n\nWhen investigators arrived at the home, Martinez and the boy\u2019s adoptive mother Romelia Martinez were outside and Pablo Martinez raised his hands in the air, saying \u201cI did it,\u201d the documents said.\n\nEmergency workers found the boy naked on a bed, wrapped him in a towel and took him to a hospital where he was pronounced dead, the documents said.\n\nRomelia Martinez told police and FBI investigators that her husband was bathing the boy and another child when she heard gurgling, went in the bathroom and saw the father holding the boy under the tub\u2019s faucet.\n\nShe also told investigators she screamed at her husband to stop, called a pastor and 911 and that her husband tried to perform CPR on the boy and poured cold water on him, the documents said.\n\nPablo Martinez told authorities he had seen \u201ca demon inside\u201d the boy and was determined to get it out, the documents said.\n\nPablo Martinez is not an enrolled member of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe, but the boy and Romelia Martinez are.\n\nFederal authorities investigate homicides on Native American reservations when suspects, victims or both are members of federally recognized tribes.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Felicia Fonseca in Flagstaff, Arizona, contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A 6-year-old boy died after his father forced him to swallow hot water from a bathtub as part of an attempted exorcism, federal officials said in court documents that accuse the father of first-degree murder.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Terry Tang"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2018/08/02/sirens_c0-0-900-524_s1770x1032.jpg?9b28fa881f4a33acee1b165db0076e895212ff98", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
