Junstrom on June 22, 1949 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the future icon moved to Jacksonville, Florida when he was 10-years-old\n\nFrom a young age he showed interest in music, leaning to play the saxophone and clarinet in the 5th and 6th grades before being inspired to pursue the rock star lifestyle watching The Beatles perform on the Ed Sullivan show.\n\nHis first guitar was a Silvertone 6-string, and he began playing in a cover band called After Five before joining My Backyard.\n\nJunstrom first met Ronnie Van Zandt as a teenager when he noticed a group of boys racing beach buggies down his street.\n\nOne of the buggies, driven by Van Zandt crashed, and Junstrom rushed over to help turn it back upright.\n\nVan Zandt told Larry, 'Thanks man,' and the two became friends, before forming what would become Lynyrd Skynyrd a few years later.\n\nIn his prime: Larry, left, with his bandmate Barnes in 1986\n\nJunstrom reflected on his time with Lynyrd Skynyrd in Stephen Kijak\u2019s 2018 documentary, If I Leave Here Tomorrow: A Film About Lynyrd Skynyrd, recalling the band\u2019s early rehearsals at the infamous \u2018Hell House\u2019, a cabin in rural Florida, as well as speaking out on the band\u2019s frequent drug use.\n\n\u2018You could put a model airplane together with his breath,\u2019 Junstrom said of Collins\u2019 fondness for sniffing glue.\n\nThough he parted ways with the band before they became one of the most iconic groups of the 1970s, even before Junstrom's departure, Lynyrd Skynyrd truly lived the raucous rockstar lifestyle.\n\nPromoters regularly provided the band with drugs and booze, and according to drummer and crash survivor Artimus Pylethe, the musicians went wild overindulging.\n\n\u2018I think they felt they were supposed to smoke every cigarette and drink everything provided and eat whatever they wanted and throw the rest against the wall,\u2019 Pylethe adds in the film. \u2018That was our road manager\u2019s duty \u2013 to carry a briefcase with probably $250,000 in cash\u2019 to bail people out of jail and placate hotel owners.'\n\nJust five days ago, Junstrom made a rare public appearance at the opening of the Sweet Homegrown Traditions exhibit in Clay County, Florida, documenting the founding of the band.\n\nIt would turn out to be the last time Junstrom was seen alive publicly, prior to Sunday's announcement.\n\nLynyrd Skynyrd is known for hits including Sweet Home Alabama. The group disbanded abruptly in 1977 following a plane crash which killed Ronnie Van Zant, replacement guitarist Steve Gaines, and backup singer Cassie Gaines.\n\nJunstrom died aged 70 on October 5.", "description": "The bass player was an original member of Lynyrd Skynyrd, which he formed in 1964 with his high school band mates, but he left the group before the release of their debut album in 1973.", "authors": ["Luke Kenton For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/16/19402846-0-image-a-38_1570462407687.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
