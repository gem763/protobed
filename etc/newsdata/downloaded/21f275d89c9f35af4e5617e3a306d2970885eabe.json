Once there, Dimitrov warded off a triple break point (and five break points total) to tie the match at two sets apiece.\n\nAfter that, Federer took a medical timeout for an undisclosed reason for close to 10 minutes. He returned to the court but was clearly not the same player, as Jose Morgado of the Diario Record noted:\n\nAfter the match, Federer revealed that is dealing with an upper back ailment but gave credit to his opponent for the win, per Ben Rothenberg of the New York Times:\n\nWhile Federer may have played at less than 100 percent, Dimitrov's win was well-deserved considering his sensational return game, historical record against his opponent prior to Tuesday and rough recent stretch.\n\nDimitrov won 48 percent of his second return points (27-of-56) compared to 30 percent (12-of-40) for Federer. He also had just 41 unforced errors to Federer's 60.\n\nHe dominated in the fifth and final set, breaking Federer twice en route to a 4-0 lead and an eventual 6-2 victory.\n\nDimitrov also won one more set Tuesday than he had against Federer in seven lifetime matches, all of which were losses.\n\nLastly, Dimitrov was not enjoying a successful season leading into the U.S. Open, as Tumaini Carayol of the Guardian wrote:\n\nA significant shoulder injury has hindered the world's former No. 3 player, who has now made three grand slam semifinals. He was off the tour for a few months to recuperate.\n\nHowever, he seems well past that injury now, and his win will certainly make a few people happy as Arash Madani of Sportsnet wrote:\n\nTennis commentator Nick McCarvel summed up the night well:\n\nDimitrov will now face No. 5 Daniil Medvedev, who beat Stanislas Wawrinka in the quarterfinals. The two men have split their two matches, both of which occurred in 2017. Their rubber match will take place Thursday at a time to be determined.\n\nThe winner will advance to the finals and face the last man standing on the opposite side of the draw.\n\nNo. 24 Matteo Berrettini will face No. 13 Gael Monfils in one quarterfinal, and No. 20 Diego Schwartzman will look to upset No. 2 Rafael Nadal in the other.\n\nThose matches will take place Wednesday, with the semifinal occurring Friday and the final taking place Sunday.", "description": "Grigor Dimitrov, the  78th-ranked men's player  in the world, defeated No. 3  Roger Federer  in a five-set thriller in the U.S. Open quarterfinals in New York on Tuesday...", "authors": ["Paul Kasabian"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/826/470/hi-res-ec3b90c9282f3d2cf19ec2c775566abd_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75"}
