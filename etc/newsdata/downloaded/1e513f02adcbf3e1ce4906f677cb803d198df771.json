And Democratic senators are getting fed up.\u201d\n\nOh, isn\u2019t that too bad, so sad.\n\nDemocrats don\u2019t like it when their own bulldogs, sent to attack conservatives, turn tail and bite them.\n\nAn example, please?\n\nWitness: Demand Justice, a progressive activist group that focuses on the courts \u2014 to \u201cstop our courts from pursuing an agenda that further enriches the wealthy and corporations at the expense of the everyday Americans\u201d is how the group puts it on its website \u2014 has been busily campaigning against all of Trump\u2019s picks. That\u2019s all fine and dandy in Democrat Land \u2014 until Demand Justice turned its eyes on Sen. Chris Coons, the leftist from Delaware, and criticized him for supporting judicial nominees who didn\u2019t pass the Brown v. Board of Education 1954 school desegregation smell test.\n\n\u201cSenator Coons can\u2019t have it both ways, professing support for civil rights and then turning around and voting for a majority of the judicial nominees who cannot say Brown, a civil rights cornerstone, was correctly decided,\u201d said Christopher King, the chief counsel for Demand Justice, after announcing a digital ad campaign against Coons in September.\n\nAround the same time frame, dozens of members of the two groups Demand Justice and Center for Popular Democracy stormed four senators\u2019 offices on Capitol Hill \u2014 including Coons\u2019 and fellow Democrat Mark Warner\u2019s \u2014 to oppose their votes on several judicial nominees. They also stopped by Sen. Dianne Feinstein\u2019s office and dropped off petitions, signed by 110,000, urging her to use her Senate Judiciary Committee platform to stop Trump\u2019s pick of Steven Menashi for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit.\n\nThat\u2019s free expression in action.\n\nBut what\u2019s interesting \u2014 what\u2019s juicy \u2014 is the Democrats\u2019 reactions.\n\n\u201cThat was way out of line,\u201d Democrat Sen. Dick Durbin said of Demand Justice\u2019s ad campaign against Coons, Politico reported. \u201cI called Chris personally and told him that I stood behind his decision.\u201d\n\nWell, well, well.\n\nAnd whah, whah, whah.\n\nDemocrat Justice, a creation of the left, filled with members of the far-left, has been attacking Trump, both openly and viciously, for some time.\n\n\u201cBREAKING,\u201d Demand Justice tweeted in July 2018. \u201cTrump just announced his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Anti-abortion. Anti-healthcare. Thinks Trump is above the law.\u201d\n\nA couple of months later, the group put out on Facebook an attack video against Trump and Kavanaugh, titled \u201cStand Up To Trump.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s more. There are plenty of more examples of Demand Justice going after Trump, Trump\u2019s judicial nominees and Trump\u2019s supporters.\n\nWhere were Democrats during all these attacks?\n\nRubbing hands gleefully in the background, silently and not-so-silently aligning with the skewed truths that this group broadcast against this president.\n\nWell, now the tables have turned.\n\nDemand Justice is going after Democrats, too.\n\nAnd while the Democrats decry, the fact is, the question pops: Doesn\u2019t this make Demand Justice a bit principled in its mission?\n\nBam. That\u2019s what Democrats can\u2019t stand. It\u2019s quite OK to spin, deceive, lie, attack, politically destroy and character assassinate Republicans and conservatives so long as it brings about a leftist design. But violate that code for some sort of higher principle and attack a member of the Democratic Party?\n\nThat\u2019s sacrilege.\n\nThat\u2019s, as Durbin said, \u201cway out of line.\u201d\n\nDemocrats can dish it out. But they sure as heck can\u2019t take it.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
