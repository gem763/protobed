The agency has stressed that it\u2019s not saying those dozen ingredients are unsafe, but rather that it needs more data, especially on their absorption into a user\u2019s bloodstream. The agency also has emphasized that Americans should continue to use sunscreen, as public health advocates and manufacturers warn that the ongoing review and a recent FDA study have led to confusion and misconceptions.\n\nRelated: Consider this nonprofit\u2019s findings before you buy sunscreen\n\nRepresentatives for sunscreen manufacturers have asked the FDA to defer rulemaking for eight sunscreen ingredients. A spokeswoman for the Personal Care Products Council, a trade group whose members include sunscreen manufacturers, said a work plan submitted to the FDA calls for providing more information on the safety of those ingredients.\n\nThe FDA told MarketWatch that it\u2019s allowing deferral requests so there can be submission of new safety or effectiveness data. An agency spokeswoman said Tuesday that the agency has just received the first such submission and is reviewing it, and it has not granted any deferrals to date.\n\n\u201cWe believe that having a greater number of sunscreen filters allows manufacturers to formulate safe and effective products to meet the diverse needs of individuals and their families,\u201d said a spokeswoman for the Personal Care Products Council. The group has about 600 members, including heavyweights such as Procter & Gamble PG, -0.23% , L\u2019Oreal USA OR, -0.60% and BASF BAS, -0.81% . It has disclosed spending an all-time high of $1.86 million last year on lobbying in Washington, D.C., followed by an outlay of $810,000 in this year\u2019s first half. The eight ingredients for which manufacturers have requested delays are avobenzone, ensulizole, homosalate, meradimate, octinoxate, octisalate, octocrylene and oxybenzone.\n\nRelated: Hawaii wants to ban certain sunscreens to protect coral reefs\n\nThe deferral requests come before a Nov. 26 deadline for a finalized FDA rule on over-the-counter sunscreens, with that date set by the Sunscreen Innovation Act of 2014. The agency has attracted thousands of comments as it reviews sunscreens.\n\nSeveral advocacy groups said in a joint comment that the big review is \u201clong overdue,\u201d adding that the FDA shouldn\u2019t weaken standards \u201cat the bequest of industry.\u201d Public Citizen, Environmental Defense Fund and the Environmental Working Group were among the outfits submitting that joint comment.\n\nOne independent sunscreen company, San Antonio, Texas-based Supergoop, is among the many commenters that has urged the FDA to avoid requiring animal testing of sunscreens in its review. Supergoop also argued in its comment that avobenzone, homosalate, octisalate and octocrylene are safe. The company disclosed in a filing this month that it has hired Washington lobbyists to work on \u201cpending FDA issues and issues related to skin cancer.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe appreciate that the FDA is taking a closer look at this critical category that is central to our nation\u2019s health,\u201d said Holly Thaggard, Supergoop\u2019s founder and CEO, in a statement to MarketWatch. \u201cWe encourage the FDA to ensure that a broad variety of safe and effective options are available to reduce the incidence of skin cancer.\u201d", "description": "With two months to go before a key date for its major review of sunscreens, the Food and Drug Administration says it\u2019s considering requests from...", "authors": ["Victor Reklaitis", "Money", "Politics Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR893_sunscr_ZG_20190923141948.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
