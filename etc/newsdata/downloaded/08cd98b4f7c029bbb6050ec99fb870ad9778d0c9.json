However, afterwards, Callum came along and offered his assistance \u2014 and Leo was fuming as the pair hugged once more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTonight, he decided to put his mission to dirty Callum\u2019s name into play, and it came to light that he\u2019d acquired an old video of Callum from his army days \u2014 and he set about orchestrating a way for Whitney to come across said video on his laptop.\n\nAfter buying Callum a drink, Leo asked him about his experiences in the army. Whitney and Lola (Danielle Harold) arrived, and Leo made clear his intention to help Whitney find out the truth about who vandalised her stall.\n\nWhile sitting with Leo, Whitney noticed a file on his laptop named \u2018Callum Highway.\u2019 Curiosity got the better of her, and she checked out the clip \u2014 and was horrified by what she saw.\n\nDuring the clip, Callum was in the presence of several men \u2014 all of whom were mocking and jeering a drunk woman. They proceeded to make comments about stripping her, and Callum attempted to talk the thugs out of it.\n\nIn the Queen Vic, Callum approached Whitney to see what she was watching, and the young woman wasted little time in letting out her frustrations over what she\u2019d just witnessed.\n\nA shocked Callum made every effort to explain how he didn\u2019t take part in the jeering \u2014 not to mention how he attempted to stop the awful behaviour his so-called mates were carrying out \u2014 but Whitney was having none of it, and accused him of holding back out of fear that his mates would find out that he\u2019s gay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCallum was devastated, and thus left the Vic, knowing that he could say little to change Whitney\u2019s opinion of him. Leo\u2019s plan had worked.\n\nHas Whitney turned her back on Callum for good? Or will she give him a chance to explain himself?\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the fact that Leo\u2019s popped up at every given opportunity is certainly odd to say the least \u2014 not to mention the fact that he was investigating Callum too \u2014 so perhaps Whitney will come to discover the truth?\n\nEastEnders continues Friday 25thOctober at 8pm on BBC One.\n\nMORE: EastEnders spoilers: A dark new storyline is revealed for Ben Mitchell as he takes revenge\n\nMORE: EastEnders spoilers: Martin Fowler in serious danger \u2014 but will he die?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Knowing Callum would prove a problem, Leo set out to muddy his name and change Whitney's opinion of him \u2014 and he succeeded in doing so.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/whitney-dean-and-callum-highway-in-eastenders_1571920911.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
