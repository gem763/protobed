But most of the time, the successful bit just scared the s**t out of me and I wanted nothing to do with it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018There\u2019s no stop button, you\u2019ve got no control over your life. And I lost complete control of everything and the last two years have been trying to take control of life back and understanding that it\u2019s on me, if that makes sense.\u2019\n\nLiam Payne revealed the toll One Direction\u2019s schedule had on his mental health (Picture: PA)\n\nHe added that he went through a \u2018real episode\u2019 and told himself \u2018you\u2019re either going to end up crazy child star who dies at whatever age or you\u2019re going to live life and get on with it properly\u2019.\n\nLiam also told Men\u2019s Health Australia about the effect the band\u2019s gruelling schedule had on his mental health, explaining: \u2018When you\u2019re doing hundreds and hundreds of [concerts] and it\u2019s the same 22 songs at the same time every single day, even if you\u2019re not happy, you\u2019ve got to go out there.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s almost like putting the Disney costume on before you step up on stage and underneath the Disney costume I was p***ed quite a lot of the time because there was no other way to get your head around what was going on.\n\n\u2018I mean it was fun. We had an absolute blast but there were certain parts of it where it just got a little bit toxic, it\u2019s difficult when you have the level of fame that we had in the band.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
