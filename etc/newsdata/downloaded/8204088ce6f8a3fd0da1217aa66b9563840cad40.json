(Feige is also fresh off the news that he\u2019ll be developing a movie in the Star Wars universe, which is also controlled by Disney.)\n\n\u201cI am thrilled that Spidey\u2019s journey in the MCU will continue, and I and all of us at Marvel Studios are very excited that we get to keep working on it,\u201d Feige said in a statement. \u201cSpider-Man is a powerful icon and hero whose story crosses all ages and audiences around the globe. He also happens to be the only hero with the superpower to cross cinematic universes, so as Sony continues to develop their own Spidey-verse you never know what surprises the future might hold.\u201d\n\nThe as-yet-untitled film will be released July 16, 2021. Amy Pascal, the former head of Sony\u2019s movie division, will also be a producer, as she was on \u201cSpider-Man: Homecoming\u201d and this year\u2019s \u201cSpider-Man: Far From Home.\u201d\n\nSony and Marvel had been producing the \u201cHomecoming\u201d movies together but could not come to terms on a new deal in August. At that point, it appeared Spider-Man movies would continue to be made by Sony on its own, without the Marvel Studios touch and the connection to the Avengers landscape, both of which have revitalized the wall-crawler\u2019s live-action films.\n\n[Does \u2018Spider-Man: Far From Home\u2019s\u2019 big reveal give a hint about what Marvel Studios has planned next?]\n\nSony, which controls the film character, received critical-acclaim on its own with 2018\u2032s Academy Award-winning animated film \u201cSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\u201d and made a lot of overseas money that same year with Spidey bad guy Venom in his self-titled cinematic debut. Perhaps the thinking was that Sony could take it from here now that Marvel Studios had given Spider-Man new life on screen.\n\nBut many fans were disappointed at the news that Spider-Man might no longer be a part of Marvel Studios\u2019 interconnected storytelling, especially after a cliffhanger ending in \u201cSpider-Man: Far From Home.\u201d\n\nNow, with this new deal, the two sides can move forward together with one of the most popular superhero brands of all.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe perfect story for Andy Serkis\u2019s \u2018Venom\u2019 sequel is already out there\n\nDiscover something new:\n\nWe\u2019ve curated these stories to inspire your curiosity.\n\nUnderstanding the human cost of your smartphone\n\nThe world has grown reliant on lithium-ion batteries, but the desperate search for the ingredients carries a steep cost.\n\nThe debate over how to provide affordable urban housing\n\nD.C. housed the homeless in upscale apartments.
