I will not be silenced", "language": "en", "text": "Steve Wilson, a Lib Dem member who works in Parliament, decided to correct my experience of racism (Picture: Steve Wilson/Twitter; PA)\n\nIn my last Metro article, I referred to being mistaken for a cleaner when I was in the Members\u2019 lift in Parliament. There is absolutely nothing wrong with being a cleaner, but the fact that someone questioned my profession because of the colour of my skin is racial prejudice.\n\nIn response to my article, a Lib Dem member who works in Parliament decided to correct my experience, he tried to undermine and belittle me. Steve Wilson is his name and he tried to gaslight me and essentially he told me to shut up and stop talking about racism.\n\nSteve Wilson actually wrote \u2018this is not true\u2019. I still find it hard to believe why he would write such a strong statement. He then went on to say that accounts like mine \u2018don\u2019t do anyone justice and anyone propagating them should stop it\u2019. So he called me a liar and told me to stop talking about racism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, in the words of Labi Siffre, \u2018the more you refuse to hear my voice the louder I will sing\u2019.\n\nIn order to stamp out racism we have to expose it in all of its ugliness \u2013 and Steve\u2019s comments to me were ugly. And the fact that he works for Angela Smith MP, who once appeared to described people of colour as having a \u2018funny tinge\u2019, worries me.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nWith this combination, what would be their attitude to people of colour who contact their office desperate for an MP\u2019s help because they have suffered discrimination? Steve has already shown to me that as a privileged white man, racism just doesn\u2019t exist. It is just not true. And his non-apology apology just to a newspaper was frankly an insult.\n\nI am still waiting for an apology from him.\n\nRacism is on the rise, many witnessed the sickening scenes during the England v Bulgaria football match recently which was halted twice due to Nazi salutes and monkey noises. If it had been stopped a third time the game would have been abandoned. I was impressed with England and Brent\u2019s very own Raheem Sterling who I have known since he was around 10 years old.\n\nIt is important to support people who are being racially abused (Picture: Catherine Ivill/Getty Images)\n\nBut why should they have to put up with three incidents of racism before decisive action is taken? This racism is happening at every level of the football pyramid and that is why it is so important to call it out, that is why it is important to support people who are being racially abused. If you have never experienced it then feel lucky and be a good ally to those who have, and those who suffer every single day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can see the bemusement and hurt in Prince Harry\u2019s eyes when he has to talk about the abuse that his wife, the Duchess of Sussex, suffers so regularly. Anyone watching the documentary this week felt the pain through the screen \u2013 it was palpable and those of us who are woke or women of colour knew the word the Duchess was avoiding saying was she was subjected to more abuse because of racism. The Duchess spoke about fairness \u2013 just be fair.\n\nIf you have never experienced racism then feel lucky and be a good ally to those who have, and those who suffer every single day (Picture: ITV)\n\nFor Black women not being heard, being overlooked, undermined, underestimated and ridiculed happens far too often but it doesn\u2019t mean that we will keep quiet about it. And the fact that social media allows us to be connected has made us stronger in our fight for a fairer society.\n\nSo if Steve thinks I am going to shut up and stop talking about it, he can think again. I am waiting for an acknowledgement from his party leader Jo Swinson, and I am still waiting for an apology from Steve Wilson. I will not be silenced.\n\nMORE: MP Dawn Butler says fellow politician thought she was a cleaner in Parliament because she is black\n\nMORE: Boris Johnson is \u2018racist\u2019, says black MP who called out abuse this week\n\nMORE: Lib Dem staffer says sorry after \u2018gaslighting\u2019 black MP Dawn Butler in race row", "description": "In my last Metro article, I referred to being mistaken for a cleaner when I was in the Members\u2019 lift in Parliament.
