Labour\u2019s extra spending commitments racked up to \u00a375bn, with the gap funded by extra borrowing which the party said was justified by the investment it was going to make.\n\nIt should be said that the IFS at the time suggested there was still a rather large black hole at the centre of the plans. But at least McDonnell made a stab at fiscal responsibility.\n\nJohnson\u2019s just laughing at it. In addition to his proposed spending boom, he says he\u2019s going to cut taxes for the wealthiest too.\n\nThat\u2019s about the only thing that you might see as truly conservative about what he and Dominic Cummings are now planning.\n\nAnd yet the Tory commentariat that blasted McDonnell as a spendthrift commie (still does if we\u2019re honest) hails everything that vents forth from the incredible sulk in No 10. It is indeed a funny old world.\n\nYes, I know Sajid Javid is nominally chancellor but his sole job is to go out and try and sell what his mafiosi bosses have cooked up. He appears to have about as much influence over policy formation as I do over the quirks in Microsoft\u2019s next operating system.\n\nPoor man. He\u2019s going to have to try and keep a straight face while explaining to the serious people that chancellors have to speak to why the IFS says the government is operating with \u201cno effective fiscal rules\u201d. And he\u2019ll have to explain to the electorate what the austerity policy he once backed was all about now he\u2019s proposing to borrow more than Labour ever dared to suggest.\n\nAll this is going to happen while his boss prepares to throw us into an economic pit courtesy of the no-deal Brexit chimera.\n\nOn the subject of the latter, Christian Schulz, an economist and director at Citi who contributed to the report, (no flag waving suited Corbynista he), said that based on likely different Brexit outcomes under the two main parties, the economy would be about 5 per cent bigger under Labour by 2022.\n\nThat\u2019s a stunning number. If I was Labour I\u2019d convert it into billions and trumpet it at every possible opportunity. If the party\u2019s communications people were smart they\u2019d hire a big red bus, slap it on the side, and drive it up and down Britain.\n\nThe detail of the report goes further in ruthlessly exposing the scale of the Conservatives\u2019 deceit and mismanagement, shining a deeply unflattering light on the impact of Theresa May\u2019s mishandling of the Brexit process on the economy.\n\nSince the EU referendum we have lost up to \u00a366bn, while private sector investment is as much as 20 per cent lower than it otherwise would have been. As the CBI has recently stated, the predictions of a bad outcome emerging from a \u201cLeave vote\u201d have been realised.\n\nBut this is just the start of it. A deal won\u2019t improve things. It will simply serve to keep us in the slow lane. No deal will serve to make a bad situation very much worse. If Johnson manages to secure and win an election, it will crash us all into a dark reality.\n\nThe best outcome of all, according to Schulz, is no Brexit.\n\nIt bears repeating that Corbyn has promised a Final Say after he has negotiated what he says will be a less damaging Brexit deal. The case for that referendum has never been stronger.", "description": "The headline grabbing part of the Institute for Fiscal Studies\u2019 annual audit of Britain\u2019s public finances is that Boris Johnson\u2019s beloved no-deal Brexit will push the government\u2019s annual borrowing bill to a 50-year-high.\u00a0 After a decade of austerity, the party that held up \u201csound public finances\u201d as the holy grail, has torched it in favour of a borrowing boom the likes of", "authors": ["James Moore"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/18/13/POLITICS-McDonnell-130878A.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
