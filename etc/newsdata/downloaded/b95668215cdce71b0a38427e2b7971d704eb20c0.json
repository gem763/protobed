I only found out after reading the newspaper. But I have seen her face,\" he said, when asked about his newborn niece.\n\nHowever, Nicholas stressed that his family isn't conventional, and that not being in contact with each other does not mean that they are estranged from one another.\n\n\"I will definitely be there for her if she needs me,\" he said.\n\nAs to rumours that his father Patrick Tse is rekindling his romance with first wife Zhen Zhen and will be getting married soon, Nicholas responded, \"That's a lot of news. That's crazy. But he's an adult. He can do whatever he wants.\"\n\n(Photo Source: on cc)", "description": "The actor admits that he didn't initially know that Jennifer Tse has welcomed her first baby", "authors": ["Heidi Hsia"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6KYB8bxcCTn4wFYQ7hA5vA--~B/aD03Njg7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ybrand.cinema.com.my/d1f9c093e1322cddb25fe47d606d0565", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
