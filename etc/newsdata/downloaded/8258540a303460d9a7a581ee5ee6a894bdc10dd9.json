REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo\n\nHONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Huawei\u2019s good times could wind down soon. Stronger smartphone sales at home helped revenue jump a surprising 24% year-on-year in the first three quarters of the year. But the Chinese tech champion has yet to feel the full impact of U.S. restrictions, set to resume next month, and domestic demand could prove unreliable too.\n\nThe world\u2019s top telecoms equipment maker has been on a U.S. export blacklist since May, which bars the Chinese group from doing business with American companies without special licences. Yet the latest set of numbers, released by Huawei on Wednesday, shows Beijing\u2019s tech champion is doing just fine. Revenue in the first nine months of the year hit 611 billion yuan ($86.2 billion). The Shenzhen-based company, which says it is owned by its employee union, only releases limited financial data. But based on previous disclosures, that implies third-quarter revenue rose 27% from a year earlier, to 165 billion yuan, according to Reuters \u2013 not bad.\n\nFounder Ren Zhengfei has loyal consumers at home to thank. Despite a contraction in the world\u2019s largest smartphone market, Huawei\u2019s smartphone shipments in China topped 37 million units in the second quarter, according to data from industry tracker Canalys, up an impressive 31% from a year earlier. That has come at the expense of rivals like Apple, as well as compatriots Oppo and Xiaomi, which all lost market share over that period. Huawei\u2019s goal is to win half of its home market, up from its current 38%.\n\nThat\u2019s bad news for rivals, but the company looks ever more vulnerable nevertheless. The latest growth was probably driven by handsets that launched before the U.S. restrictions kicked in. Huawei is also enjoying a reprieve, which will expire in November. Absent another extension from Washington, the company will lose access to critical components and software tools for both telecoms equipment and smartphones. Jefferies analyst Edison Lee estimates Huawei has just over three months of inventory, based 2019 first half numbers from regulatory filings.\n\nAt the same time Huawei\u2019s China market ambitions look vulnerable as shoppers pull back amid slowing economic growth. Winter might come earlier than expected.", "description": "(Reuters Breakingviews) - Huawei\u2019s good times could wind down soon.
