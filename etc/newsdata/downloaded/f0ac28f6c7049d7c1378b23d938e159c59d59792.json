The reason for the surgery is unclear, but his latest setback has shocked many of his fans.\n\nAlthough he never won the Mr Olympia contest \u2013 the world\u2019s most prestigious bodybuilding competition \u2013 he was runner-up in it three times (1993, 1998 and 1999) and he is ranked among the best bodybuilders ever, with his legendary symmetry taking the sport to a whole new level in the 1990s.\n\nWheeler has yet to make a formal statement but reports suggest he intends to speak on his condition in the next few days. He is maintaining a positive outlook and remain in good spirits, according to his team.\n\nJust two years ago he made an astounding comeback from retirement to place 15th at the Mr Olympia Classic Physique. News of his amputation also came less than a month after he celebrated the birth of his grandson, Messiah Amir Bell.\n\nBefore starting his bodybuilding career, the Californian trained in martial arts as a teenager, becoming a competent taekwondo player before a serious leg injury forced him to quit the sport.\n\nKenneth \u201cFlex\u201d Wheeler is a four-time winner of the Arnold Classic. He won the last of his Arnold Classic titles in 2000.\n\nHe is considered the best bodybuilder never to have won the Mr Olympia title and was once described by Arnold Schwarzenegger as one of the greatest competitors he had ever seen. Eight-time Mr Olympia Ronnie Coleman has also said Wheeler was the best bodybuilder he competed against.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger leads tributes to Hall of Fame bodybuilder Ed Corney\n\nIn 1994, Wheeler crashed his Mercedes-Benz, leaving him with a broken neck, but he made a miraculous comeback a year after his near-fatal collision, winning the Iron Man Pro Invitational contest before finishing runner-up in the Arnold Classic the same year.\n\n\u201cI was exhausted because I was on a liquid diet because my body couldn\u2019t handle food yet after the car accident,\u201d he said of his comeback.\n\nFour years after his car wreck, Wheeler discovered he had focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, a form of kidney disease, which he said was inherited and extremely rare, although studies have shown that many years of steroid use might have contributed to his illness. He needed a kidney transplant in 2004, a year during which he announced his first retirement from the sport at age 37.\n\nThe American icon said in past interviews that he had battled years of depression after his kidney illness became apparent as he lost most of his muscle mass and the sponsors that go with it because he wasn\u2019t able to stay competitive.\n\nHis fans quickly offered support to the man known as the \u201cSultan of Symmetry\u201d in his heyday.\n\n\u201cStay strong brother. Ain\u2019t nothing u can\u2019t overcome,\u201d wrote noahgucciardo on his official Instagram account.\n\n\u201cKeep ur head up. Ur a legend in ur sport!\u201d said another user.\n\nSome of Wheeler\u2019s former rivals on the stage also came out to show support, with former Mr Olympia competitor Shawn Ray writing: \u201cPrayers for speedy recovery for Hall of Famer, Flex Wheeler!\u201d\n\nIt is not the first time that a top bodybuilder has had his leg amputed because of complications. Last year, IFBB Men\u2019s Physique Pro, Shawn Labega, underwent leg amputation below his right knee after suffering a blot clot in his right calve as a result of poor circulation.", "description": "The four-time Arnold Classic winner has battled health issues and was involved in a near-fatal car accident in 1994\n  The 54-year-old American is said to be in good spirits and will release a statement in the next few days", "authors": ["Unus Alladin"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/22/86a35c48-f4c9-11e9-87ad-fce8e65242a6_image_hires_205444.jpeg?itok=047gyamy&v=1571748890", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
