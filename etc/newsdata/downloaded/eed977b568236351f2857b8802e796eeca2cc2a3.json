A 1902 review in The New York Times of a program at Cooper Union, the series\u2019 first home, said that the audience\u2019s \u201cattention and manifest understanding are such as to put pretentious up-town audiences to shame.\u201d\n\nThe organization still draws engaged, knowledgeable crowds to hear its chamber music and recitals. The pianist Garrick Ohlsson, who has performed several times, said he had found the subscribers \u201ca passionate and well-informed audience \u2014 and beautifully behaved.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the Town Hall series, Peoples\u2019 Symphony has two six-concert series at Washington Irving, which has general admission seating, and subscriptions cost $50 (or $8.33 a concert). Mr. Salomon said many subscribers arrive early to make sure they can get the best seats, or sit with large groups of friends or relatives. The slightly more expensive Town Hall series has assigned seats. To attract younger listeners, subscribers to any series can now bring up to two children for free, and $25 student passes allow access to all 18 concerts, which would let completists hear them for just $1.39 apiece.", "description": "Peoples\u2019 Symphony Concerts quietly offers Carnegie Hall-quality artists for less than a Manhattan movie ticket.
