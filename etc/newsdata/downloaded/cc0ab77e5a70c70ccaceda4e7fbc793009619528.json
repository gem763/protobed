Organizers canceled the England-France match planned in Yokohama, near Tokyo, and New Zealand-Italy game in Toyoda, in central Japan.\n\nOrganizers also canceled a marathon in Sendai and other northern coastal towns, and Formula One auto racing in Suzuka in central Japan may also be affected.\n\nHagibis, which means speed in Filipino, had maximum sustained winds of up to 270 kilometers (168 miles) and stronger gusts at noon Thursday near Chichi island in the Pacific, about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) off Tokyo\u2019s southern coast. It was moving north at the speed of 20 kph (12 mph) and is expected to weaken over cooler waters as it nears Japan\u2019s main island.\n\nIt\u2019s the equivalent of a Category 5 hurricane.\n\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency says the typhoon is forecast to hit ashore in the Tokyo area late Saturday and urged people to take precautions to avoid potentially life-threatening danger. Japan\u2019s central Pacific coast may see torrential rains beginning Friday while high waves and tides may cause flooding.\n\nAirlines and train services anticipate cancellations affecting holidaymakers traveling over the three-day weekend that includes Sports Day holiday on Monday.\n\nThe approaching typhoon is spreading fear especially in Chiba, near Tokyo, which was hit by Typhoon Faxai last month and many residents are still recovering from damage to their homes. The typhoon tore many electrical poles and snapped cables, triggering extensive outages that lasted for weeks, contributing to heat illnesses and other health problems among elderly people.\n\nEast Japan Railway Co. said it may suspend services on most local lines and bullet trains around Tokyo before the typhoon arrives.\n\nJapan Airlines and All Nippon Airways said they may ground flights as early as Friday depending on the typhoon\u2019s movement.\n\nJapan is regularly hit by Pacific storms, including Faxai in September. Typhoon Jebi flooded a terminal and a runway at Kansai International Airport last year.\n\n___\n\nFollow Mari Yamaguchi on Twitter at https://www.twitter.com/mariyamaguchi\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Japan is bracing for a super typhoon on track to hit central and eastern regions over the three-day weekend with potential damage from torrential rains and strong winds.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mari Yamaguchi"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/09/japan_asia_typhoon_44904_c0-86-2000-1252_s1770x1032.jpg?b05386dd4a3c1df68e87b552b7ec3fb2fc42b559", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
