(Photo: Provided/Ashley Fitz)\n\nWhen Ashley Fitz's husband was deployed in January 2018, she took her three sons to Walmart and told them to pick out something special. It was just one way the Shelbyville, Ind. mom tried to make her husband's deployment easier on their kids. She certainly never thought it would be the subject of national news.\n\nWhile the family was looking in the toy truck section, Jynsen, the Fitz's youngest, wandered toward the baby dolls. He pointed up at a particular doll. His doll.\n\nAshley took the doll off the shelf, and soon Jynsen was shopping for a stroller and bottles. He would later name the baby Three, though Ashley still isn't sure why. Jynsen was 2 years old at the time.\n\nHer son asks for a photo shoot\n\nLast Tuesday, Sept. 24, Fitz was editing photos \u2014 she has photographed newborns and babies professionally for the past year \u2014 while Jynsen sat on the couch, swaddling Three. The now 4-year-old then walked over to his mom and said, \"I take pictures with my baby.\"\n\nFitz didn't need convincing for the impromptu photoshoot. Jynsen decided Three was a girl \u2014 or \"grill\" as he pronounced it \u2014 and picked out a headband for the photoshoot. When his mom was finished and showed him the photos, Jynsen thought they were \"bootiful.\"\n\nSo did thousands of strangers. Fitz posted the photos to her professional Facebook page that night. It has since been shared 33,000 times, has 11,000 comments and 130,000 reactions.\n\nHonestly, Fitz said, the response was \"extremely overwhelming.\"\n\n\"Because I've never had this kind of attention before,\" she said. \"There was a lot of really mean comments, and it gave me a lot of anxiety at first.\"\n\n'Toys do not have genders'\n\nSome people didn't think Jynsen, a boy, should be playing with a baby doll. It was so upsetting to Fitz that she considered taking down the post. But then a mom reached out to her and told her Jynsen's photos had helped her son. That mom's little boy had also played with a baby doll, only to put it down when his friends teased him. After seeing the photos of Jynsen, he picked the doll back up.\n\nFitz decided to keep the post up.\n\n\"Because 95% of it is extremely positive,\" she said of the social media reaction.\n\nNow that she's received the unexpected attention, Fitz hopes her son's photoshoot sends an important message to parents and children.\n\n\"That toys do not have genders,\" she said. \"... children should be able to play with whatever they choose.\"\n\nContact IndyStar reporter Elizabeth DePompei at 317-444-6196 or edepompei@indystar.com.
