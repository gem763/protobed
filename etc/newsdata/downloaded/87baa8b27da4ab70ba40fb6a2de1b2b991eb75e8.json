Finito. Goodbye. Whatever way you wish to look at \u2013 and describe \u2013 the dramatic investment events of the past five days, Neil Woodford's career as a front-line fund manager is over.\n\nWoodford Investment Management is no more. Kaput. Adios. Good riddance.\n\nAlthough the end was swift when it came \u2013 like a house of cards collapsing \u2013 it had been obvious for months that the 59-year-old Oxford-based asset manager was living on borrowed time, especially when the dramatic decision was taken in June to suspend dealings in flagship fund Woodford Equity Income.\n\nToast: Woodford Investment Management is no more. Kaput. Adios. Good riddance\n\nAn investment fund that by then resembled an equity income portfolio in name only. A fund not invested in a portfolio of income- friendly UK companies as investors would have expected, but one full of illiquid, esoteric junk.\n\nAn investment vehicle not fit for purpose, put together by a fund manager out of control, untamed and unchecked (by regulators and internal compliance), and who thought he could walk on water \u2013 only to discover like everyone else (OK, almost everyone else) that he couldn't.\n\n'The crux of the matter was that his organisation [Woodford Investment Management] was probably inadequate for purpose,' said Peter Hargreaves, joint founder of fund platform Hargreaves Lansdown that has made millions of pounds of profits backing Woodford from the day he set up in business in 2014 after a successful career with asset manager Invesco Perpetual.\n\n'With the benefit of hindsight, it couldn't cope with the billions of pounds that poured in from investors.'\n\nAlthough Hargreaves remains a big shareholder in Hargreaves Lansdown, he had long stood down as an executive before the fund platform started ramping Woodford Equity Income on its 'best buy' lists. 'Was he a great stock picker?' continued Hargreaves.\n\n'Again, with the benefit of hindsight, I am not sure. I believe he was a good top down economist and in the past [at Invesco] he called sectors of the market extremely well.\n\n'With hindsight, it appears he didn't have the knowledge in unquoted companies and rarely a week went by without him being steeped in various problems.' Damning words.\n\nIt's over: Neil Woodford's career as a front-line fund manager is over\n\nWhile Woodford showed a smidgin of contrition at the bitter end last week \u2013 'I personally deeply regret the impact events have had on individuals' \u2013 as first he lost the mandate to keep managing the \u00a32.9 billion Equity Income fund, then stood down as manager of investment trust Patient Capital, it was too little too late.\n\nHis army of investors had long rebelled, outraged at not being able to access their nest eggs entrusted to him.\n\nApoplectic over his bloody- minded (and greedy) decision to keep taking a management fee from Equity Income while they fretted over what would happen to their investments.\n\nDaily fees of \u00a365,000 sucked from the value of their ever-shrinking, inaccessible holdings \u2013 a sum that most of his investors (those still working, that is) could only dream of earning in 36 months of hard graft.\n\nMore than \u00a38.7million taken in fees from fund investors while Equity Income remained shut \u2013 money that investors will never see again. Money probably swilling around the Woodford investment empire as you read this.\n\nOh, and let's not forget last week's suspension of the \u00a3253 million Woodford Income Focus \u2013 a result of an investor exodus \u2013 a fund that Woodford will continue to draw a daily fee of \u00a35,000 from until such time that Link Fund Solutions (the overseer of the fund) finds a replacement manager. Talk about deja vu, groundhog day and all that. Insulting.\n\nFrom the day Equity Income was suspended, Wealth campaigned for the fees on the fund to be waived. Woodford refused to budge.\n\nSpeaking out: Last week, Peter Hargreaves said: 'Again, with the benefit of hindsight, I rather suspect why Woodford didn't heed your [Wealth's] plea to waive the management charge was because he knew he was toast and took as much money as he could anticipating the demise of his business'\n\nLast week, Peter Hargreaves said: 'Again, with the benefit of hindsight, I rather suspect why Woodford didn't heed your [Wealth's] plea to waive the management charge was because he knew he was toast and took as much money as he could anticipating the demise of his business.'\n\nOn Friday, Woodford said he appreciated that many in the financial services industry wished to express their views.\n\nHe added: 'I am sorry, and I personally deeply regret the impact events have had on The Mail on Sunday readers who placed their faith in Woodford Investment Management and invested in our funds.'\n\n'The whole thing stinks doesn't it,' remarked an irate John Rowlands. He invested more than \u00a320,000 in Woodford Equity Income when the fund launched in June 2014 \u2013 and will be lucky if he gets back more than \u00a317,000 once the fund is wound up early next year and proceeds start being paid to investors.\n\nHe's also got money in funds managed by Hargreaves Lansdown that have exposure to Equity Income.\n\n'Small investors lose out while Woodford is allowed to sail off into the sunset with his millions, apparently scot-free. What a fiasco. What an injustice.'\n\nIncandescent John, a 74-year-old retired factory worker, was not finished. Speaking from his home in Lichfield, Staffordshire, he went on to criticise Hargreaves Lansdown for relentlessly recommending Woodford on its 'best buy' fund list \u2013 right up until Equity Income was suspended in June.\n\nHe wouldn't have bought the fund, he said, if it hadn't been for Hargreaves Lansdown's aggressive promotion of it ahead of launch \u2013 based on Woodford's successful investment record at Henley-on-Thames-based Invesco Perpetual.\n\nNor would he have hung on to it if he had been privy to the information that Hargreaves Lansdown had on it in 2017 (its increased exposure to illiquid stocks), but chose not to disclose to clients.\n\nHe also described the regulator overseeing Woodford and the rest of the investment funds industry \u2013 the Financial Conduct Authority \u2013 as a 'giant waste of space'.\n\nHis is not a lone voice. Investors have universally turned on Woodford, the regulator and those fund platforms (principally Hargreaves Lansdown) which peddled his fund wares. In despair more than in hope. Hung out to dry like smoked mackerel.\n\nIn some investors' eyes (not mine), Woodford is now a financial pariah. A name, they say, to be muttered in the same breath as the directors of Equitable Life who ran the insurance mutual into the financial ground in the late 1990s, resulting in savage cuts to the value of savers' pots.\n\nYes, maybe a little harsh and a little over the top, but understandable.\n\nIt must be said a small cabal of financial advisers have (incredibly) remained loyal to Woodford throughout.\n\nJust ahead of Link pulling the plug on Woodford's management of Equity Income, they took to social media to preen about sharp gains recorded by both Equity Income and Woodford Income Focus on Friday, October 11 \u2013 a result of hopes on a Brexit deal and a rise in the value of sterling (hopes revived again last week).\n\nThen, post Link's announcement to remove Woodford from the helm of Equity Income, they challenged those who thought the closure of Woodford Investment Management was 'right' to put a note in their diary to check the performance of Woodford's key fund holdings three years from now.\n\nTheir view is that Woodford had been culled from Equity Income too hastily.\n\nNo mention, of course, was made of Woodford's disastrous foray into unquoted holdings \u2013 breaking fund rules in the process. Blinded by the past.\n\nBlinded by an unholy allegiance to Brand Woodford \u2013 and maybe driven out of business if, as likely, their professional indemnity insurance premiums go through the roof because of material client exposure to Woodford.\n\nSo, what is likely to happen to the money of investors caught up in the Woodford debacle?\n\nWhat should happen to those involved in this sorry scandal?\n\nAnd what needs to be done to ensure investors can once again trust the investment industry to look after their financial interests?\n\nWhat happens to investors now?\n\nWoodford Equity Income\n\nFor investors trapped in Equity Income, they can do nothing now but wait for the fund to be wound up and the holdings sold. This is being orchestrated by asset managers BlackRock and Park Hill.\n\nWhile BlackRock will oversee the sale of Equity Income's liquid assets \u2013 essentially, its stakes in FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 companies \u2013 Park Hill will organise the disposal of the unquoted or more illiquid positions.\n\nLink indicates that the first return of investors' capital is likely to happen at the end of January. Further returns will then be made as the trickier assets are sold.\n\nAs for the losses investors are likely to crystallise as a result of this process, they are dependent upon a number of factors \u2013 market movements in the weeks ahead, continued fund management fees (no longer paid to Woodford), trading costs and the sale prices that Park Hill will be able to secure for stocks that may attract little buyer interest.\n\nWaiting game: For investors trapped in Equity Income, they can do nothing now but wait for the fund to be wound up and the holdings sold\n\nAlan Miller is co-founder of wealth manager SCM Direct and a longstanding fund manager in the City. Taking into account all factors, he has analysed Equity Income's portfolio and believes that investors could eventually expect to get back around 74p per share \u2013 compared to the current price of 85p.\n\nThe first payment \u2013 just over half of the total \u2013 will come early next year, but the rest may take a year or more to come through.\n\nThis means that someone who had bought into Equity Income at the end of December 2016 may end up losing some 44 per cent of their original investment.\n\nSomeone who bought at the end of 2017 may lose more than half their investment. These are only guess-estimates, stresses Miller, but based on sound portfolio analysis.\n\nWoodford Income Focus\n\nAlthough this fund was suspended four days ago as investors sought to get their money out in response to Woodford's removal from the helm of Equity Income (and his decision to shut Woodford Investment Management), prospects for trapped investors are cheerier than for compatriots holed up in Equity Income.\n\nThis is because the fund's portfolio is more liquid than Equity Income \u2013 it has little exposure to unquoted or illiquid stocks.\n\nIndeed, Income Focus's portfolio, primarily invested in FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 stocks, is the fund Equity Income should have been if Woodford had stayed true to the principles that served him so well at Invesco Perpetual.\n\nWhile trapped investors will be annoyed that Woodford continues to draw \u00a35,000 of daily fees from Income Focus, his involvement will be short-lived.\n\nThe fund could soon be wound up and cash returned to investors \u2013 or more likely it will be taken over by a rival asset manager in the coming weeks. An update is expected from Link before the end of the month.\n\nWoodford Patient Capital\n\nUnlike sister funds Equity Income and Income Focus, this investment trust remains 'open'. This is because it is a company (an investment trust) listed on the London Stock Exchange and its shares can be traded by investors.\n\nYet, Patient Capital, with a market capitalisation of \u00a3300million, is not without its major issues. Its shares are currently trading at 33p \u2013 compared to \u00a31 when it made its stock market debut in April 2015 \u2013 and its portfolio is awash with unquoted companies of questionable value.\n\nSome of these companies are also held in Equity Income where Park Hill has been given a mandate by Link to dispose of them. This is likely to result in the value of Patient Capital's assets being dragged down further.\n\nOpen: Unlike sister funds Equity Income and Income Focus, Woodford Patient Capital investment trust remains 'open'\n\nIt also has \u00a3111million of borrowings that could need to be repaid early next year if the trust's position does not improve. This would leave Patient Capital in a perilous position.\n\nAlan Brierley, investment trust analyst at Investec, believes the trust's shares are a firm 'sell'.\n\nOn Friday, he told Wealth: 'The ineptitude of the board and manager [Woodford] means that shareholders are exposed to an investment company that is highly borrowed and holds a pile of highly illiquid stocks.\n\n'This is a very dangerous cocktail.'\n\nThe trust could be wound up in similar fashion to Equity Income with the money generated from asset sales returned to shareholders. But the trust's illiquid portfolio means such a procedure could take a while \u2013 possibly even years \u2013 to complete.\n\n'The original concept of Patient Capital [investing in start-up businesses] was brilliant,' adds Brierley.\n\n'However, the execution has been catastrophic.'\n\nWhen a new manager is appointed, Brierley also believes the trust's chairwoman Susan Searle should stand down.\n\nHe describes her comment in 2017 that 'there is often a misconception that unquoted assets are illiquid' as 'simply staggering'.\n\nWhy he MUST pay back every penny of \u00a38.7m Since the Woodford debacle began in earnest in June, the fund manager has for the most part been holed up in his Oxford offices. Throughout, he has steadfastly refused to speak to the press \u2013 Wealth made another request to speak to him on Tuesday in the aftermath of confirmation that Equity Income was being wound up, but it was turned down by external public relations enforcer Roland Cross. An email sent direct to Neil Woodford asking for an interview was also ignored, although he did respond in writing to criticisms levelled by Peter Hargreaves. The only 'public' appearances he has deemed to make in recent months were to financial advisers he was keen to keep on side while there was a chance of Equity Income reopening its doors and Woodford Investment Management surviving. He never once sat before investors and explained why things had gone so wrong. A little bit of mea culpa might have saved his business. Investors believe that at the very least, Woodford should now be hauled before the all-powerful Treasury Select Committee, grilled (verbally, not physically) and asked to account for his mismanagement of the three funds \u2013 and defend his decision to keep taking fees from Equity Income when it was suspended. The committee has a fine record in holding big names to account \u2013 for example, retailer Philip Green. John Astall, a retired chartered accountant from Warrington in Cheshire, is one of many Woodford investors who believes the fund manager should be forced to squirm before the committee. He said: 'I recently watched Peter Fankhauser, chief executive of failed Thomas Cook, grilled and humiliated by members of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Select Committee. Woodford should face a similar examination. We need answers from him as to how he could have got things so horribly wrong. 'He should also be asked a simple question, face to face: 'Will you return the \u00a38.7 million of fees taken from Equity Income since the fund was suspended in June?' '\n\nDo you believe Neil Woodford should be required to return the \u00a38.7 million of fees he took from Equity Income while it was suspended?\n\nIf you are a Woodford Equity Income investor would you support a 'class action' lawsuit against him for breaking rules on exposure to unquoted companies?\n\nAnd if you bought the fund via Hargreaves Lansdown from late 2017 onwards, would you support a class action on the grounds that you were not given information that Hargreaves Lansdown had about the fund's exposure?\n\nLet us know your views.
