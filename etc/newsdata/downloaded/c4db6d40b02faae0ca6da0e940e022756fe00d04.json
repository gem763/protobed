As soon as the office was made aware of it, the block was reversed, early Tuesday evening, he said.\n\nCathy... stfu You \ud83d\udc4f bought \ud83d\udc4f a \ud83d\udc4f pipeline <a href=\"https://t.co/XBldWAzLCt\">https://t.co/XBldWAzLCt</a> \u2014@canada_strike\n\nClimate Strike backs the weekly international protest inspired by Thunberg that encourages young people to walk out of school on Fridays as a call for urgent climate action.\n\nThunberg will be in Montreal on Friday for a climate strike rally there, one of several such protests planned across the country.\n\nEmma Lim, Climate Strike Canada's Ontario co-ordinator, said she wasn't sure who published the offending tweet, because the account has many users, some of them in elementary school.\n\n\"In the future, we will use more appropriate language,\" she said.\n\nLim said that her group did not specifically reach out to McKenna over being blocked, choosing instead to respond on Twitter.\n\nNo idea how this happened but fixed. I agree that we need to listen to young people on climate! \u2014@cathmckenna\n\nMcKenna has come in for a significant amount of verbal abuse and threatening behaviour in her role as environment minister. The threats have been judged real enough that the minister sometimes requires a security detail.\n\n\"I think it is horrific that Catherine McKenna is receiving threats,\" said Lim. \"We are students, are we are also receiving threats and it's a scary situation to be in, but so is the climate crisis.\"", "description": "Catherine McKenna\u2019s office says it did not intentionally block a youth climate action group from following her on Twitter because of inappropriate language.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5190898.1561649927!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/carbon-tax-20190625.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
