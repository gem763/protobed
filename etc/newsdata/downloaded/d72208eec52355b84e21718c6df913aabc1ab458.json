the lowest return in the division - as the absence of Croatian striker Andrej Kramaric weighs heavy.\n\nHow the top six in the Bundesliga looks as we approach the seventh round of the season\n\nBayer Leverkusen vs RB Leipzig\n\n2.30pm UK time\n\nAnother test of RB Leipzig's title credentials coming up this Saturday as they make the trip to sixth-place Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nBoth come into the fixture off the back of disappointing results in the Champions League, with Leverkusen comfortably beaten by Juventus and Leipzig losing at home to Lyon.\n\nThat came off the back of their surprise 3-1 home defeat to Schalke last weekend that saw Bayern leapfrog them to the Bundesliga summit.\n\nRB Leipzig suffered a shock defeat to Schalke last weekend as they were knocked off the top\n\nJulian Nagelsmann and his team will demand a return to winning form but Leverkusen are actually in good touch - they have won nine of their last 12 Bundesliga games this season and last.\n\nThey also have two of the league's most in-form players in Kevin Volland, who has been involved in 20 league goals this calendar year, and Kai Havertz.\n\nFreiburg vs Borussia Dortmund\n\n2.30pm UK time\n\nIt may still be early in the season but nobody predicted that Freiburg would be in the nosebleed territory of third place in October.\n\nChristian Streich's team have been the surprise package so far with four wins from six constituting their best-ever start to a Bundesliga season.\n\nHowever, they are sure to be tested against a Borussia Dortmund side who have blown hot and cold at times during the opening weeks.\n\nFreiburg are enjoying their best-ever Bundesliga season with four wins from six matches\n\nWhen it clicks they can be devastating but vulnerabilities have been on display, especially in their loss to Union Berlin and last weekend's frustrating home draw with Werder Bremen.\n\nThey do, however, come into Saturday's game off the back of a win in the Champions League over Slavia Prague on Wednesday in which full-back Achraf Hakimi excelled.\n\nAchraf Hakimi scored twice as Borussia Dortmund defeated Slavia Prague on Wednesday night\n\nDortmund could be without prolific striker Paco Alcacer for their trip to the Black Forest as he struggles with an Achilles injury.\n\nThey are unbeaten in 16 Bundesliga matches against Freiburg and if would set a new club record if they make it 17.\n\nPaderborn vs Mainz\n\n2.30pm UK time\n\nPaderborn remain the Bundesliga's only winless club so far this season but they will take great heart from the way they pushed Bayern close last weekend.\n\nHowever, Steffen Baumgart's newly-promoted side know that there isn't a column for effort in the league table and they run the risk of being cut adrift even this early in the campaign.\n\nPaderborn emerged with credit from their loss to Bayern Munich last week but have yet to win\n\nThat's why Saturday's home fixture with Mainz is so vitally important with their opponents just two points above them and with just one win to date.\n\nMainz's last two games have been tight, seeing them lose 2-1 away at Schalke and 1-0 at home to Wolfsburg but they too need points and urgently.\n\nTheir away record is rotten, however. Mainz have lost 11 of their last 12 competitive games on the road.\n\nHow the bottom six in the Bundesliga looks ahead of this weekend's seventh round of games\n\nSchalke 04 vs Cologne\n\n5.30pm UK time; Live on BT Sport 3 and BT Sport Ultimate\n\nIt's been a glorious start to the season for David Wagner's Schalke with last weekend's win over Leipzig their fourth in succession as they moved to within a point of leaders Bayern.\n\nYoung Welshman Rabbi Matondo scored his first goal for the club in that success and he is likely to keep his place for the visit of Cologne.\n\nWelshman Rabbi Matondo celebrates scoring his first Bundesliga goal for Schalke last week\n\nAmine Harit has been another of Schalke's stand-out performers, with four goals and four assists from his first seven games this season in league and cup.\n\nThe trip to Gelsenkirchen won't be one Cologne are relishing having lost their last three games and the two most recent by 4-0 scorelines.\n\nThey've only found the net four times this season and so rejuvenated Schalke will start as strong favourites.\n\nSUNDAY\n\nBorussia Monchengladbach vs Augsburg\n\n12.30pm UK time; Live on BT Sport 2\n\nMonchengladbach are another of the cluster of teams sat on 13 points just behind leaders Bayern following a fine start to the season.\n\nThey could be affected by a long Thursday night Europa League trip to Istanbul, however, when they take on Augsburg in Sunday's early kick-off.\n\nMarcus Thuram celebrates scoring in Gladbach's last home fixture against Dusseldorf\n\nHome form has been a bit of an issue for the Foals, with just one win in 11 at their Borussia-Park, though that did come a fortnight ago against Dusseldorf.\n\nAugsburg have still only won once this season and last weekend's 3-0 home loss to Bayer Leverkusen supplied further evidence that a relegation scrap may be on the cards.\n\nThey're far from brilliant on their travels as well, so start as second favourites against Gladbach.\n\nWolfsburg vs Union Berlin\n\n2.30pm UK time; Live on BT Sport 2\n\nAlong with Bayern, Wolfsburg are the only other team in the Bundesliga to be unbeaten after the first half-dozen matches, a new club best.\n\nAfter three successive 1-1 draws, they held out to claim a 1-0 win at Mainz last time out and while they may not be the most exciting, they are certainly tough to beat.\n\nWolfsburg's Marcel Tisserand celebrates scoring their winning goal at Mainz last weekend\n\nThey'll certainly fancy converting six undefeated into seven against Union Berlin, who have failed to build on their amazing win over Dortmund.\n\nLosses to Werder Bremen, Bayer Leverkusen and Eintracht Frankfurt since that memorable night have reminded the newly-promoted side of how harsh life in the top flight can be.\n\nThe battle of the strikers will be interesting as Wolfsburg's Wout Weghorst comes up against Union's Sebastian Andersson - both have three goals so far this season.\n\nEintracht Frankfurt vs Werder Bremen\n\n5pm UK time; Live on BT Sport 2\n\nIt's been a mixed start to the season for Eintracht Frankfurt, who were forced to juggle the early weeks of the season with Europa League qualifiers.\n\nThey played well to win 2-1 at Union Berlin last weekend having snatched a late point at home to Dortmund a week earlier.\n\nBas Dost (centre) celebrates scoring in Eintracht Frankfurt's win over Union Berlin\n\nTheir commitments on Europe could well act as a leash on their top six ambitions this season but they'll fancy their chances of a win against Werder Bremen in Sunday's late game.\n\nWerder, too, held Dortmund to a 2-2 draw last weekend but they've been pretty inconsistent and you often don't know which team is going to turn up.", "description": "It's the final weekend of Bundesliga football before the internationals return and each of the teams will want to break off on a high point.
