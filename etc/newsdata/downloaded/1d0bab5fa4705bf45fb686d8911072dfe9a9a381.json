But as the new head of that department, he won\u2019t have to recuse himself from working on a revamped version.\n\nThat\u2019s the determination of career government lawyers, The Wall Street Journal reports.\n\nThe department\u2019s ethics lawyers decided that applicable ethics rules and the Trump administration\u2019s ethics pledge do not require Scalia to recuse himself, Kate O\u2019Scannlain, the department\u2019s solicitor, said.\n\n\u201cThe new rulemaking is not a \u2018particular matter involving specific parties\u2019 and litigation related to a prior rule which the secretary handled while in private practice has ended,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nThe Obama-era rule had required brokers and advisors offering advice on retirement accounts to adhere to a fiduciary standard, but the financial-services industry challenged it in court. Following an appeals court\u2019s decision to vacate the rule, the Trump DOL (under Scalia\u2019s predecessor Alexandar Acosta) disclosed it would develop a new version.\n\nThe ethics lawyers\u2019 decision isn\u2019t sitting well with consumer advocates.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what type of legal gymnastics lawyers had to do to come to such a ridiculous conclusion,\u201d said Dennis Kelleher, chief executive of Better Markets, a group that advocates for stricter oversight of Wall Street. \u201cEveryone can now be highly confident the Department of Labor will propose and finalize a rule that the industry will cheer and retirees will pay the price for.\u201d\n\n--Ross Snel", "description": "Government ethics lawyers have determined that new Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia can participate in the department\u2019s work on a revamped fiduciary rule.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://asset.barrons.com/public/resources/images/ON-DH487_Eugene_OR_20191030170556.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
