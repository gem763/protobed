I think that played a crucial role in closing it at the end.\u201d\n\nEarlier, in the first session, Europe struck first when Austrian Thiem beat Canada\u2019s Shapovalov 6-4 5-7 13-11, saving three match points in the super tiebreak.\n\nThiem, ranked fifth in the world, needed only one break of serve to take the opening set, but the 20-year-old Shapovalov fought back to break twice in the second set to tie the game at one set apiece.\n\nThe young Canadian led 9-7 in the tiebreak before squandering his match points as Thiem clawed his way back to win the contest on his second match point.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really special thing with the tiebreak in the third,\u201d Thiem said. \u201cIt creates lots of close moments and match points on either side. It\u2019s also a little bit of luck at the end.\u201d\n\nAmerican Sock earned Team World their only point of the day after securing a 6-1 7-6(3) win over Italian Fabio Fognini.\n\nFognini failed to convert any of his six break points in the match as Sock won five games in a row to take the opening set.\n\nFederer and Rafa Nadal, with a total of 39 Grand Slams between them, gave Fognini plenty of advice during breaks in play as the second set went with serve until the tiebreak.\n\nBut Sock came away victorious after Fognini double-faulted at 3-5 before the Italian made a backhand error to surrender the match.", "description": "Team Europe took a 3-1 lead over Team World on the first day of the Laver Cup after winning two of three singles matches and the doubles contest in front of a sellout crowd in Geneva on Friday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1432132852&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J25M", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
