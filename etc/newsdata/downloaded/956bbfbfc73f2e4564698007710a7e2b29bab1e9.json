Setting U.S. Treasury securities aside, most investments are in companies, not the government. Fiscal policy\u2014the government\u2019s tax and spending strategies\u2014does matter, but over long periods of time, not over a 24-hour news cycle.\n\n\u201cThere are ways to measure specific effects,\u201d says Andrew, who oversees $12 billion in assets under management at the Wisconsin-based firm. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to live in that real world and not just let the noise freeze us up and keep us from doing something.\u201d\n\nChange Doesn\u2019t Happen Overnight\n\nOne reason not to obsess over politics, and specifically the upcoming U.S. presidential election, is that it\u2019s still relatively early in the election cycle. Candidates who rise in popularity early often don\u2019t win their party\u2019s nomination.\n\nThat didn\u2019t stop one investor from telling Andrew, recently, that he was skittish about investing in healthcare stocks because of leading Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren\u2019s plan to create a Medicare for All healthcare plan that would eliminate private insurance.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, she\u2019s not the president. Secondly, in order for her to get that passed, she\u2019s going to need to get some help from Congress. And thirdly, there are 70 million people who are approaching age 60 or more,\u201d Andrew says. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that the amount of money spent in this country on healthcare will continue to rise, and that\u2019s a tailwind for healthcare investments. [Warren\u2019s] policy is much less important to me than that tailwind.\u201d\n\nMissed Opportunities\n\nPaying attention to politics also can blind investors to truths in the global economy. A few weeks ago, Andrew was giving a speech to a group of investors, and he suggested they think globally when considering technology stocks. Those who think Facebook, Amazon, and Netflix are too expensive should look at Tencent, Alibaba, and Baidu\u2014Chinese tech companies that can add diversity, and growth, to a portfolio.\n\nA gentleman in the audience raised his hand and said, \u201cOur president is fighting China\u2014why would I want to help companies in China and put them in my portfolio?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a response grounded in politics that ignores the fact that China has 3 billion people, many of whom are tech savvy consumers.\n\nWhat About the Trade War?\n\nA slowdown in the global economy resulting from the U.S. trade war with China is a real result of President Donald Trump\u2019s trade stance, but Andrew says it isn\u2019t some \u201cnebulous thing to fear.\u201d It\u2019s quantifiable. Instead of saying, \u201cI need to get out of the market because we\u2019re raising tariffs,\u201d use the information at hand to figure out the tangible result to earnings.\n\n\u201cWe know if we put 25% tariffs on $540 billion worth of goods, that probably causes the economy to slow by 0.07%, give or take two- or three-tenths of a percent,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not happy about 3% growth going to 2%, but it\u2019s not the end of the world. And I can understand which companies are more or less affected by that and then make investment decisions that way.\u201d\n\nProfiting from Volatility\n\nThe markets, of course, react constantly to shifting political winds. Consider the U.S. bond market, where the 10-year Treasury yield has bounced half a percent up and down several times in just the last six weeks.\n\n\u201cAlmost all of that is tied to the noise that comes from the trade conversation,\u201d Andrew says.\n\nInvestors should instead focus on what the \u201cfair value\u201d of the 10-year note should be and think about whether that will change whether we get a trade deal or not. Neither result is likely to have a big effect, since any deal that\u2019s struck won\u2019t be great and if no deal is struck, nothing has changed, Andrew says.\n\n\u201cOur view would be watch that volatility around what you believe to be fair value and take advantage of that,\u201d he says.\n\nJohnson Financial sees fair value for the 10-year at about 1.75% to 2% (it\u2019s trading at about 1.79% today), in part because interest rates in Europe are so low. The German 10-year bond is in negative territory, trading nearly 0.4% below 1%.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been pretty bullish on the bond market for a long time, and we\u2019ve been chastised a lot for that because there\u2019s this desire to see rates move significantly higher,\u201d Andrew says. \u201cWe just don\u2019t see that in the cards.\u201d\n\nIf Treasury prices fall and rates bounce back to 2%, Andrew says his firm would be a buyer, \u201cbecause I think we could probably see the lows again.\u201d (Treasury rates move in the opposite direction of prices.)\n\nThe same dynamics are true in the stock market. There have been some fairly significant moves in recent months on short-lived news events. \u201cThat disruption in the market is something that investors can take advantage of,\u201d Andrew says.\n\nFor individual investors who rebalance their portfolios according to the calendar, for example, at the end of every quarter, or every year, \u201cthis is a good time to take a more proactive approach,\u201d Andrew says, \u201cand to pay a little bit more attention to how to take advantage of that volatility.\u201d", "description": "Johnson Financial\u2019s Brian Andrew on why investors are best off focusing on real-world facts", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-119498/social", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
