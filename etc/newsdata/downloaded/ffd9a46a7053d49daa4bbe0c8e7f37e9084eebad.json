You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThese credits are added to the NI record of the carer if they are still under state pension age and help them to build up a full state pension.\n\nWith separate research by SunLife this week revealing that a quarter of those approaching retirement are worse off than they expected to be and more than half of those in their 50s or older are financially supporting their children and or/grandchildren, the boost could go some way to alleviating the pressure. As long as families know about it.\n\nNeed to know\n\nA parent who has gone back to work is likely to be paying NI in their own right and so no longer needs the NI credit that comes with receipt of child benefit. They can sign this over to the family member who is looking after their child, at no cost to themselves.\n\nThe scheme is known as the \u201cspecified adult childcare credit\u201d because other family members, such as aunts and uncles, can also apply, not just grandparents.\n\nCarers aren\u2019t required to do a minimum number of hours to qualify and claims can be backdated \u2013 to the introduction date of the scheme if appropriate, which was in 2011.\n\nUnder the scheme, the child benefit recipient confirms that she (or he) no longer wishes to benefit from the NI credit that comes with the child benefit; this might be because they are out at work and paying NI contributions in any case, so do not benefit from the credit.\n\nAnd it\u2019s worth doing.\n\nWith about 44 per cent of grandparents alone currently under the state pension age and, therefore, eligible for the scheme, these credits can be of considerable value to someone who would not otherwise build up a full state pension \u2013 which requires 35 years\u2019 worth of NI contributions. Millions of people are expected to retire on less than the full state pension due to a shortfall.\n\nOne year of NI credits can be worth 1/35 of a full pension. The full state pension is currently \u00a38,767 per year, so 1/35 of that is around \u00a3250.\n\nThis means that someone who claims these credits for a year could get an extra \u00a3250 on their pension, or around \u00a35,000 in total over the course of a typical 20-year retirement.\n\nIn the dark\n\nIn 2015/16, a freedom of information request revealed that just 1,298 grandparents and other family members were benefiting from the scheme. Following a burst of publicity, the number claiming rose to 10,084 by 2017/18, according to a new FOI response. But this is still thought to be a small fraction of all the people who could benefit.\n\nThe numbers who are missing out are not known precisely, but according to research by the charity Grandparents Plus, around two-thirds of all grandparents report that they spend time looking after grandchildren. With more than 7 million grandparents in Britain (of all ages) with grandchildren under 16, the 10,000 or so individuals who currently claim NI credits is likely to only be a small fraction of those who are entitled.\n\n\u201cWhile it is great news that thousands more grandparents are now benefiting from this scheme, the numbers are still a drop in the ocean out of all those who could benefit,\u201d Steve Webb, director of policy at Royal London, who tabled the FOI, says.\n\n\u201cIt is increasingly common for grandparents to spend some time each week looking after their grandchildren, often to enable a parent to go out to work. It would be quite wrong if these grandparents suffered financially in terms of their own state pension as a result. This scheme needs to be much better publicised and I would encourage any family with a grandparent under pension age who helps out with the childcare to find out more.\u201d\n\nMore information about the scheme is available on the government website.
