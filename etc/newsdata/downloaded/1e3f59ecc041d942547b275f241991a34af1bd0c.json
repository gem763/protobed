A brain tumour is a growth of cells that multiples in an abnormal, uncontrollable way. They are more common in adults, but children are occasionally affected. More than 9,000 people are diagnosed with brain tumours each year in the UK. Tumours can be cancerous or not, with cancerous tumours generally growing faster and spreading. Common symptoms include seizures, vomiting, drowsiness, personality changes, and severe, persistent headaches. Their cause is unknown, however, previous cancer sufferers and those exposed to radiation are more at risk. Treatment varies but can include steroids, surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. What are the warning signs? \u00b7 Persistent or recurring vomiting \u00b7 Persistent or recurring headaches \u00b7 Balance / co-ordination problems / walking problems \u00b7 Blurred or double vision \u00b7 Poor balance and co-ordination \u00b7 Abnormal eye movements \u00b7 Abnormal head position \u00b7 Fits or seizures \u00b7 Behavioural changes, especially tiredness \u00b7 Increasing head circumference in babies Source: NHS Choices\n\nMs Garbutt said: 'As soon as Millie told me she was poorly, I quickly asked if she was doing it to get out of PE.\n\n'But as the days went by I knew that wasn't the case.

In some cases this could be the result of a brain tumour.\n\n'Many people don't realise that a sight test can check for more than just your vision and that it can pick up other health concerns, such as high blood pressure, diabetes and brain tumours.\n\n'In fact only 61 per cent of people are aware that an optician can detect some types of brain tumours.\n\n'That is why ensuring you have regular eye checks - at least once every two years or more often if recommended by your optician - is so important.'", "description": "Millie Garbutt, from Croydon, was advised to get an up-to-date eye test by her GP, after being sent home from school with a crippling headache four years ago.", "authors": ["Stephen Matthews Health Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/09/20271896-0-image-a-10_1572255668112.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
