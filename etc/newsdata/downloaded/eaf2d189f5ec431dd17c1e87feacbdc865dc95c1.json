That looks very good. Then the second question that has to be solved but has not been precisely determined right now is the length of the extension.\"\n\nBut, she said, if the U.K. is still in the EU after November 1, \"then of course I would ask the U.K. to send a commissioner.\"\n\nJohnson has previously made clear he would not nominate anyone for von der Leyen's Commission.\n\nThe new Commission was due to take office on November 1 but its start date was delayed after the European Parliament rejected three of von der Leyen's nominees. It is now expected to take office at the beginning of December at the earliest.", "description": "Prospect of extension \u2018looks very good,\u2019 incoming European Commission chief says.", "authors": ["Andrew Gray", "David M.
