So this is a positive thing. It's a positive thing for the south side of Chicago, they're getting the Barack Obama library, and I would hope that more people here in New York City would be receptive to this.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBorelli said that although he anticipates zoning issues and questions surrounding where on the island is a good spot for the library to crop up, he is optimistic that it will ultimately be a positive addition to the Trump-supporting borough.\n\n\"It [the Obama library] will be transformative for the south side of Chicago-- unquestionably a lot of jobs, a lot of positive vibes,\" he said. \"We want the same thing in New York City.\"", "description": "A New York City lawmaker is hoping for a \"fair shot\" from President Trump\u00a0after asking him to consider housing his presidential library on Staten Island.", "authors": ["Vandana Rambaran", "Vandana Rambaran Is A Reporter Covering News", "Politics At Foxnews.Com.
