But despite discussing before the match what action they would take should there be a repeat of the racist abuse which marred England\u2019s qualifier in the Bulgarian capital in 2011, Henderson insisted that the entire team was in accordance about continuing because they felt to do otherwise would have sent the wrong message.\n\n\u201cI obviously wasn\u2019t happy with the situation that we were in, it wasn\u2019t nice to be involved in and it shouldn\u2019t be happening in 2019, it is very disappointing,\u201d said the Liverpool midfielder. \u201cBut at the same time, I felt as though as a team we dealt with it so well, we touched on it before we came here just in case it did happen and unfortunately it did. So we spoke together and the decision was that we carried on because if you leave the pitch and stop the game they win, really.\u201d\n\nHenderson added: \u201cThat is how we looked at it and what the message was in the dressing room at half-time. We wanted to go out in the second half and make them suffer and make their team suffer on the pitch and I think we did that.\u201d\n\nEngland\u2019s 6-0 victory was Bulgaria\u2019s biggest-ever home defeat, with Ross Barkley and Raheem Sterling both scoring twice either side of goals from Marcus Rashford and the captain, Harry Kane. Henderson paid tribute to the professionalism shown by Southgate\u2019s side in managing to rise above the racist abuse and singled out Tyrone Mings for the way the Aston Villa defender handled the situation on his first appearance for his country at any level.\n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be happening and will obviously tarnish that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time I thought he dealt with the situation so, so well. It was a top performance for his debut, I thought he was magnificent. That just shows the character in him and in the team and it will just make us stronger, no doubt. We stayed together like we should have and we spoke about it before, handled it well and if one player didn\u2019t want to carry on we would have stopped playing, simple as that, no problem. But everyone wanted to carry on and we wanted to let football do the talking.\u201d\n\nHenderson also praised the reaction of England\u2019s supporters after they were among the first to hear the abuse, responding with a chant featuring the words: \u201cYou racist bastards, you know what you are\u201d as early as the 20th minute. \u201cI thought our fans were brilliant. All night I thought they were outstanding,\u201d he said. \u201cThey stood behind us like they always do. They are unbelievable all the time but it is times like that you want them right behind you and they certainly were. That just brings us together even more.\u201d\n\nHenderson added: \u201cWe are obviously happy with the performance but still feel like it shouldn\u2019t be happening in this day and age. To hear the announcement about the racism and then the whole stadium whistling was a bit strange. I\u2019m sure something will be done.\u201d", "description": "Jordan%20Henderson%20says%20England%20wanted%20to%20make%20racist%20fans%20%u2018suffer%u2019%20%7C%20England%20%7C%20The%20Guardian", "authors": ["Ed Aarons"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
