Lo Should Be an Oscar Contender for \u2018Hustlers\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "It is certainly among the best movie moments of the year, and quite possibly could rank among the greatest character entrances ever. In Hustlers, Jennifer Lopez arrives via stripper pole.\n\nShe\u2019s playing Ramona, a veteran stripper and the main attraction at a New York City strip club where Wall Street pricks sling hundreds, right before the financial crisis of 2008. A sparkling G-string and bikini top do their best, but the truth is there is no diverting your eyes from Lopez\u2019s abs\u2014as much a special effect as there\u2019s ever been in a movie\u2014as she struts, twirls, writhes, grinds, dances, and preens. You\u2019ve never seen the movie star exude such gritty, carnal energy. It\u2019s as discomfiting as it is mesmerizing.\n\nTo cap it all off, the entire routine is performed to Fiona Apple\u2019s \u201cCriminal\u201d\u2014\u201cI\u2019ve been a bad, bad girl...\u201d\u2014the first time that the indie rocker has licensed the song for a film. It\u2019s the crowning achievement of a movie brimming with brilliant music cues. Jennifer Lopez. Stripping. To \u201cCriminal.\u201d\n\nIt is the perfect scene. To call it provocative is an understatement, but not in the way you might expect\u2014just as Hustlers is not the kind of movie you expect when you hear about a film centering on a group of stripper thieves with Lopez, Cardi B, and Lizzo on the cast list.\n\nHustlers\u2014which comes out Friday and premiered this weekend at the Toronto International Film Festival\u2014is directed by Lorene Scafaria (The Meddler), who adapted the screenplay from the 2015 New York magazine article \u201cThe Hustlers at Scores,\u201d written and reported by Jessica Pressler. It\u2019s a wild, subversive, long-time-coming thing, to see a movie set mostly at a strip club starring some of the most beautiful women in show business, shot with a female gaze.\n\nThe male gaze in film, otherwise known as \u201calmost every film you\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d depicts women as sexual objects for the pleasure of a heterosexual male viewer or creator. The female gaze, it turns out, depicts women as... women.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t just upend and recharacterize the strip-club scenes, but also brings a rare, energizing perspective to a genre the industry doesn\u2019t typically give women the opportunity to write and direct. (Indeed, Scafaria was only given the director\u2019s chair after Martin Scorsese and Adam McKay passed.) Hustlers isn\u2019t a movie about strippers. It\u2019s a movie about strippers who do crime, women who, feeling injustice, take their financial security into their own hands. It\u2019s a thriller, and one of the most fun you\u2019ll see this year.\n\nNEWSLETTERS The Daily Beast\u2019s Obsessed Everything we can\u2019t stop loving, hating, and thinking about this week in pop culture. Subscribe By Clicking \"Subscribe\" you agree to have read the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy\n\nAs detailed in Pressler\u2019s article, a group of New York City strippers who found themselves struggling to make ends meet after the market collapse in 2008 left their clientele unemployed and, as a result, out of the Champagne Room.\n\nRamona\u2014the characters in the film are fictional avatars of real women, with changed names\u2014a maternal figure for the girls, develops a scheme to help get them all back on their feet. Along with Destiny (played by Constance Wu), whom she views as a daughter, and two firecracker newbies named Annabelle and Mercedes (Lili Reinhart and Keke Palmer), she would \u201cfish\u201d for vulnerable men at downtown bars who seemed like they could have impressive credit limits, drug them with a cocktail of MDMA and ketamine, bring them back to the club, and charge up their credit cards, taking a portion of the profit.\n\nWhen the men would complain, they\u2019d shrug: What are you going to do? Tell the cops and your wife that you spent too much money at a strip club?\n\nThe story needs a director like Scafaria to do it justice. It\u2019s not dark, seedy, or grim. (Even thrillers can have a male gaze.) It\u2019s raucous and fun. Triumphant, even. These girls were extremely good at what they did. They were smart, driven, and, until they weren\u2019t, careful.\n\nThey were businesswomen. Just in this case, the power suits were a designer mini dresses. They were investing in themselves. Like true sharks, they bent the law as far as it would go to get every last dollar; that\u2019s what those men on Wall Street did, after all, and none of them were in jail.\n\nThe movie begins with a voiceover that is a bit on-the-nose, but extremely satisfying (a critique that could apply to much of the film, really). \u201cThis is a story about control... This time I\u2019m going to do it my way.\u201d It\u2019s Janet Jackson, introducing the first thumping beats to her song \u201cControl,\u201d as the camera heads backstage at the club.\n\nIt takes a beat or two into Lopez\u2019s stripping routine as Ramona to register why this movie feels so different. Then it clicks: We\u2019re watching her dance through the eyes of Constance Wu\u2019s character, Destiny, a struggling stripper looking for someone to show her the ropes. She isn\u2019t lusting after Ramona. She is dumbstruck, in awe of her. She wants to be her.\n\nThe entire time she is on stage for that routine, Ramona is in control. A toss of her hair, a flash of that heart-stopping smile, or, at one memorable moment, on her back throwing her legs behind her head: She is telling you where she wants you to look, what parts of her body she wants you to see at that moment, and, more, how she wants you to see her.\n\n\u201c The female gaze, it turns out, depicts women as...women. \u201d\n\nWhat you marvel about in the scene is Lopez\u2019s strength, the sheer power of the training and athleticism that allows Ramona to pull off that routine. It\u2019s less \u201clook at her do that\u201d and more \u201chow does she do that?\u201d It\u2019s sexy because Ramona designed it to be that way and wants it to be that way\u2014not just because she is inherently sexy. But it\u2019s not sexy because of a leering camera, exploitative angles objectifying the body, or an overt attention to arousal.\n\nIt\u2019s a wholly new thing to witness, as are the scenes backstage at the club, where the women mill about under harsh fluorescent lights. They\u2019re in various stages of undress, sure, but simply because that\u2019s the job. They are going through the motions of getting ready like any worker punching the clock, gabbing and gossiping like colleagues at a watercooler. It\u2019s a setting and film sequence we\u2019ve been taught to be titillated by, because that\u2019s the only way we\u2019ve ever seen it. Here\u2019s it\u2019s all clinical, rudimentary. And, because of that, so much more revealing.\n\nSpeaking in generalizations\u2014there are exceptions to every stereotype\u2014typically strippers as we see them on screen are defined by their profession. Every step they take in the movie, every bit of dialogue they are given, every storyline or backstory they have are in service of one thing: How they became a stripper, how they feel about it, and how they will get out of it.\n\nThese are fully drawn characters and a plot that largely takes place in private rooms of a strip club, so it tracks that these concerns are present. But because Scafaria\u2019s camerawork, gaze, and perspective have already made us think differently about these scenes and these women, we also instinctively think more deeply about who they are, how they justified their actions, and how being a part of this crime ring made them feel.\n\n\u201c It\u2019s sexy because Ramona designed it to be that way and wants it to be that way\u2014not to mention because she is inherently sexy. \u201d\n\nIt\u2019s clever, then, in more ways than one, to prominently feature Julia Stiles\u2019 character, Elizabeth, the journalist based on New York magazine\u2019s Pressler, who first reported the real-life story.\n\nStiles is one of the first characters we meet in the film, when we see her interviewing Wu\u2019s Destiny some time after the event, coaxing the story of what happened out of her so it can be told, by and large, through flashbacks.\n\nWhen Elizabeth meets Destiny, the journalist is a perfect conduit for the audience, which is to say skeptical and judgey. This is a stripper who drugged men and stole their money. At face value, that\u2019s unconscionable. But throughout the film, you watch her start to understand, to empathize. Finally, she can see these girls for who they are, which is far more complicated and nuanced.\n\nIt\u2019s gratifying to see Elizabeth factor so prominently into the film, as some of the most memorable lines on screen are lifted almost verbatim from dialogue Pressler managed to get for her article. That includes the one that seems to explain how and maybe even why these women pulled this entire wild thing off: \u201cMen don\u2019t want to admit what happened to them, being victimized by a woman.\u201d\n\nHustlers is a significant movie, quite possibly one of the most blissfully female and representational movies of the year, using platform stilettos as a high-heeled Trojan horse for conversation about gender politics, economic justice, and dignity. It is also\u2014and this can\u2019t be undersold\u2014a hoot.\n\nWhen Lopez coos, \u201cDoesn\u2019t money make you horny?\u201d I screamed. The next time you see her, she is lounging seductively on a rooftop sucking on a cigarette in a floor-length fur coat, and nothing has ever looked so fabulous. When she and Wu get in a car, turn on the radio, and \u201cIt\u2019s Britney bitch\u2026\u201d blares from the speakers, Lopez shouts, \u201cThat\u2019s my motherfucking shit right there!\u201d I felt that.\n\nWhen Wu relishes their success, saying, \u201cWe weren\u2019t just dancers anymore. I was the CFO of my own fucking corporation,\u201d I wanted to stand and applaud. And when Lopez and Cardi B are training Wu on how to give a better lap dance, the trio repeating the mantra \u201cdrain the clock, not the cock\u201d over and over, well, forget about it.\n\nYou want to soak yourself under every celebratory sprayed bottle of Champagne, invite yourself to every shopping spree, and, hell, even drug a guy or two with the girls. Does all of this get a little repetitive as the film goes on, possibly even slowing things down? Sure, especially since, if you\u2019ve read the article, you know how it all ends. But that\u2019s why Wu and Lopez, especially, deserve accolades for the career-best work they put in here.\n\nTo put it simply, they act the shit out of their scenes together. This is an intimate story between Ramona and Destiny, women who leaned on each other, and a bond that saved both their lives. They are forces of nature when they team up for their con, and devastating in its aftermath. From Lopez, it\u2019s the kind of dynamo movie star performance that gets rarer and rarer, where a character so perfectly fits how we view a performer but still upends every expectation.\n\nMy friend at Variety, Ramin Setoodeh, keeps describing it as Lopez\u2019s version of Erin Brockovich, by way of Matthew McConaughey\u2019s magnetic performance in Magic Mike. That\u2019s a fair assessment, but it\u2019s also singularly its own beast\u2014and she is a ferocious mama bear in this. She should be a serious Oscar contender, if the studio is smart, in the supporting category; Wu, who gets top-billing, is the true lead of the film, and this is the perfect example of a supporting performance that succeeds at just that: support.\n\nIt\u2019s the secret weapon of Hustlers, deployed from minute one: Who wouldn\u2019t support these girls?", "description": "J.
