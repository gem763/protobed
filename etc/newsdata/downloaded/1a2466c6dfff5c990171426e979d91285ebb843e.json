It has decreased from about 63 percent in 2000 to 56 percent in 2018\n\n'Businesses have more options to automate hard-to-fill positions now than in the past,' the study authors write. 'With rapid advances in robotics and artificial intelligence, robots can perform more jobs and tasks that required human skills only a few years ago.'\n\nMost would think that a strong labor market in the US would mean a boom in wages, but as the use of robotics rises, the lower the national income becomes.\n\nEconomists at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco found that there has been a decline from about 63 percent in 2000 to 56 percent in 2018, as first reported by Bloomberg.\n\n'Recent developments in robotics and artificial intelligence have renewed concerns that robots could render workers redundant, possibly leading to what Keynes (1930) called 'technological unemployment', wrote Sylvain Leduc and Zheng Liu, who led the study, in the published paper.\n\n'Stagnant wage growth and recent declines in the labor share of income have also heightened fears that automation's growing importance may have weakened workers' bargaining power.'\n\nThe bank has suggested that human works feel they have lost their bargaining power when it comes to asking for a raise out of fear they may be replaced by a robot\n\nHOW WILL ROBOTS CHANGE THE WORKPLACE BY 2022? The World Economic Forum has unveiled its latest predictions for the future of jobs. Its 2018 report surveyed executives representing 15 million employees in 20 economies. The non-profit expects robots, AI and other forms of automation to drastically change the workplace within the next four years. By 2022: Jobs predicted to be displaced: 75 million Jobs predicted to be created: 133 million Share of workforce requiring re-/upskilling: 54 per cent Companies expecting to cut permanent workforce: 50 per cent Companies expecting to hire specialist contractors: 48 per cent Companies expecting to grow workforce: 38 per cent Companies expecting automation to grow workforce: 28 per cent\n\nThe team noted that businesses now have more options to use automation to fill positions that were difficult to find human workers to do.\n\nThe paper also highlighted that with the decline in robotic equipment prices has made it much more profitable for firms to automate position than in the past.\n\nAs a result, the bank said that 'in this environment, workers may be reluctant to ask for significant pay raises out of fear that an employer will replace their jobs with robots.'\n\nLabor shares began to see a fall in the early 2000s - the portion of the national income that goes to employees - which they decreased about seven percent. A majority of this came from the financial crash and have remained low since.\n\nThe national income is the compensation to all factors of production in the economy, from human workers to maintenance costs and purchasing of automation equipment.\n\nThe team noted that businesses now have more options to use automation to fill positions that were difficult to find human workers to do\n\n'The significant decline in the labor share reflects that increases in real wages have not kept up with labor productivity improvements over the past two decades,' the economists wrote.\n\nAlthough automation may seem like a threat, it has the opportunity to give 'employers another option in wage negotiations and thus weakens workers' bargaining power.'\n\nAnd even with the technology hindering the portion of the national income, the economists do have some believe bringing robots and AI into the workplace is a good move.\n\n'Although automation weighs on the labor share in our model, it nevertheless has a positive impact on aggregate employment and thus has contributed to the steady decline in the unemployment rate in recent years,' the paper reads.\n\n'The option to automate jobs boosts the incentive for firms to create jobs, because they can adopt a robot to perform the job if the search process fails to yield a match with a worker.'\n\n'Therefore, our model does not predict that automation triggers a form of technological unemployment,' the economists added.\n\nThe team has concluded that regardless of the benefits of automation in the workplace, wages have been kept much lower than they would have without the rise of robotics.", "description": "The Federal Reserve Bank   found robots are eating American's paychecks.
