Here's what to consider first", "language": "en", "text": "'Gazza the Movie', a proposed documentary about the life of footballer Paul Gascoigne, is a major eyecatcher as a potential investment, given his popularity and colourful life, both on and off the pitch.\n\nIt was touted to This is Money as a 'big screen investment opportunity', in an email that offered 'capital back with a 20 per cent uplift in the first instance, then a 50/50 split with the studio'.\n\nBut the requirement to stump up a minimum of \u00a310,000 for 18 to 24 months and the sky-high risks of niche investments like films, should give an investor reason to exercise extreme caution - even before delving into the specifics of any particular offer.\n\nWe look at the prospects of making money from Gazza the Movie and the temptations and risks of putting money in ventures like this one.\n\nPaul Gascoigne: A movie about the football star is a major eyecatcher as a potential investment\n\nGazza the Movie: How would you make money?\n\n'Gazza a great football story' is the line across a picture of Paul Gascoigne in his sporting heyday, which tops an email recently sent to This is Money by Sovereign Resources.\n\n'The movie Gazza describes the life of one of the greatest footballers England has produced. Paul Gascoigne (Gazza) has experienced many highs and lows in his life and the movie portrays this in a very vivid way,' it goes on.\n\n'We believe the movie will be a huge success and provides a tremendous opportunity for investors.'\n\nThe details of the deal are described as below:\n\n\u2022 Minimum investment \u00a310,000;\n\n\u2022 Investment term: 18 months to 24 months;\n\n\u2022 At least 30 per cent of funding already in place;\n\nHow do you research companies offering investments? You can check whether a firm is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority here. The FCA says on its site: 'Firms and individuals can only offer most financial products and services in the UK if they are authorised, registered or approved to do so, or are otherwise exempt. 'Yet some act without our authorisation or registration, or without being exempt. 'If you deal with a firm (or individual) that is not regulated you may not be covered by the Financial Ombudsman Service or Financial Services Compensation Scheme if things go wrong.' The FCA's warning list to help people check out investment opportunities is here. You can also research for information about a firm, its history and who runs it on Companies House website here. Entries have three sections - overview, filing history, and people.\n\n\u2022 Gazza feature documentary offers capital back with a 20 per cent uplift in the first instance, then a 50/50 split with the studio;\n\n\u2022 All equity investors are in first procurement position so get paid out first with uplift;\n\n\u2022 Film and TV are currently going through a transition period and the digital arena is the place to be at present;\n\n\u2022 The big digital players like Netflix, Amazon, Facebook and Apple all have billions a year to spend on original content and all have to replace stock to make sure they retain subscribers;\n\n\u2022 Gazza the production is already in pre-production. This is important when investing into film. We make sure that the opportunity is as risk free as possible.\n\nClicking on a link to 'find out more' leads to a web page asking a potential investor to complete a form to get 'full details of this fantastic opportunity'. This asks for name, email and phone number, and any comments.\n\nYou are also asked to tick a box, consenting to being contacted via telephone and/or email and your data being stored in accordance with European GDPR regulations, and agreeing to the terms of use and privacy policy.\n\nWe contacted Sovereign Resources' director, Alan Dean, via the details given on its website to ask how investors will make money from the planned documentary.\n\nHe said: 'All we do is purely introduce investors to the producers that's all. Once the documentary is released it's at that stage investors get the uplift plus the original investment back.'\n\nWhen we asked how investors could be sure the film would be released, he said: 'They can't be. Film investment is regarded as a high risk investment. It's about the life of Paul Gascoigne. An icon documentary. They generally do work.'\n\nRegarding the '50/50 split', he added: 'It depends what happens. Netflix might take this on. If it's sold all investors will get some of the profit.'\n\nSovereign Resources is not on the Financial Conduct Authority's register of authorised firms, and Dean confirmed that it is not regulated by the City watchdog.\n\nIts entry on the Companies House website says it was incorporated in June 2018, but that in August it voluntarily asked to be struck off and dissolved, and that this is due to take effect on 3 November.\n\nWhen we asked about this, Dean said: 'That is correct. The company isn't registered in the UK. We don't need to be registered in the UK.'\n\nOn the firm's website, it gives an address in Bucharest, Romania. Since our interview with Dean, the Gazza movie investment promotion has been removed from Sovereign Resources' homepage.\n\nWhat else did we find out when probing Gazza the Movie as a possible investment?\n\nAn internet search for 'Gazza documentary investment' returns an entry for Warrior Film Promotions. This promotes 'Gazza Documentary - Exclusive to Warrior Film Productions - Limited availability' at the top of its homepage, accompanied by pictures of the football star.\n\nIt gives no investment details, but invites people to contact the firm by email or phone. The 'about us' section of the website says: 'Warrior Film Promotions delivers exceptionally viable film investments to an eclectic range of clients all over the world.\n\nGazza on film 'Gascoigne' was a documentary about the footballer, released in 2015 and featuring interviews with him and other top sport stars Gary Lineker and Wayne Rooney. A new movie about Gazza with the working title '30 Years of Hurt' was announced in June this year. This is a biopic where the makers are mooting the possibility of a major star playing Gazza, and we found no connection between that project and a documentary being promoted by Sovereign or Warrior.\n\n'The opportunity to become involved in some of the best Independent British Films is usually reserved for the very well connected within the film industry, Warrior Film Promotions are your segway into this elusive market.\n\n'We work with highly experienced Directors and Producers with stunning track records in creating movies that boast both critical and commercial success.\n\n'All funds are sent directly to the studio or the S.P.V. [special purpose vehicle] attached to the film. All contractual obligations are between the studio and the investor. Warrior Film Promotions never handle funds and are employed in the capacity to market and assist in raising the budget of the film.\n\n'You can feel safe in the knowledge that your investment sits with an established team of film makers, and that your exit strategy and well being are at the forefront of all involved.'\n\nWhen we contacted Jeff C Clarke, managing director of Warrior - which also uses the name Warrior Film Productions - he told us that investors who get in touch and qualify as having a solid interest are passed on to film studios.\n\n'We are a marketing company and cannot give financial advice, nor do we have information about past performance. Anyone we pass on to the studio we tell to carry out full due diligence. All presentations are given by the studio we are marketing the project for.'\n\nHe further explained: 'Investors make their own mind up with information provided by the studio, and all sign a High Net Worth or Sophisticated Investor forms and checks before completing any investment.\n\nWho are high net worth or sophisticated investors? To qualify, investors must have recently signed one of several, slightly varying statements about their wealth. Doing so allows firms to promote 'non-mainstream pooled investments' - for which, read high risk - to them that they aren't permitted to market to the general public. 'High net worth', in very broad terms, means you have an annual income of \u00a3100,000 or more, or at least \u00a3250,000 in net assets not including a primary residence or pension. 'Sophisticated' might, for example, mean that you are a director of a company with a \u00a31million-plus annual turnover. The Financial Conduct Authority's handbook of rules and guidance has details of the statements investors are asked to sign here.\n\n'Please also be aware that anyone we introduce to the studio(s) are contracted directly with the studio and also pay any monies directly to the studio(s).'\n\nThis is Money could not find either Warrior company on the FCA register of authorised firms, and Mr Clarke said they did not need to be as they do not offer financial services, only an introduction to a studio providing an opportunity.\n\nOn the Companies House website, the entry for Warrior Film Promotions says its business is 'motion picture production activities', and that its most recent accounts have been overdue since July.\n\nThe filing history shows three notices for compulsory strike-off by the Registrar of Companies - one active, and the other two made in January this year and January 2017 but discontinued.\n\nNotices on why action was halted on the two previous occasions say 'cause has been shown why the above company should not be struck off the register and accordingly the Registrar is taking no further action under section 1000 of the Companies Act 2006'.\n\nUnder section 1000, the registrar can remove a firm if they have reasonable grounds to think no business is going on.\n\nThe entry for Warrior Film Productions says it was incorporated in June this year. Geoffrey Kevin Clarke is listed as a director for both companies, and Mr Clarke confirmed this was him, and said from a child he has always been known as Jeff.\n\nHe said he had recently split from another director in Warrior Film Promotions and it was in the process of being closed down, while Warrior Film Productions was set up with him as sole director. He added that his accountant dealt with any limited company issues.\n\nMr Clarke, who told This is Money he was an executive producer on nine films, cited Amy, Senna and Maradona as examples of successful documentaries, and said in his opinion the Gazza feature could also be a good opportunity.\n\nInvestors should note that Senna, Amy and Maradona were all directed by the same man, Asif Kapadia, who won an Oscar for the Amy Winehouse documentary.\n\nMr Clarke told This is Money to contact the studio when we asked who was directing the Gazza documentary, but we have not managed to discover who is making it.\n\nIs this kind of high risk investment wise?\n\n'Whenever you're considering an investment, you need to know exactly what you're investing in, and who with,' says Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\nSarah Coles: 'If you're dead set on investing directly in film, you should bear in mind that it's incredibly high risk, so you should only put in money you can afford to lose'\n\n'In this case, beyond the hyperbole of the company encouraging you to part with your money, there's no hard information available about the project, so I wouldn't touch it with a bargepole.'\n\nRegarding the success of the Amy documentary, she says: 'It's like someone persuading you to invest in their start-up by highlighting the money you could have made by investing in Apple.\n\n'Another serious alarm bell is that the company you saw offering the investment, Sovereign Resources, isn't regulated by the FCA, and its director has applied for the company to be struck off the register of Companies House.\n\n'It's notoriously difficult to make money from films. If you're not a specialist in this area, it's very easy to be dazzled by the glamour and lose money.\n\n'If you're dead set on investing directly in film, you should bear in mind that it's incredibly high risk, so you should only put in money you can afford to lose.\n\n'A sensible alternative may be to invest a small part of a diverse portfolio into companies involved in films.\n\n'You can buy shares in the likes of Disney, Netflix, Amazon and Cineworld - to bask in some of the glamour without taking anything like the same level of risk.'\n\nLaura Suter, personal finance analyst at AJ Bell, gives a rundown of what to consider and to be on the look-out for when weighing up the prospects of unusual investments.\n\n'Investors can be drawn in by new and potentially exciting ways to invest their money, particularly if they think it could give them a slice of the movie mogul lifestyle,' she says.\n\n'However, all of these investments need to considered very carefully and there are lots of red flags here.\n\n'Firstly, potential investors should be wary of anything where they are approached out of the blue for an 'investment opportunity'. This is not a great starting point for investing.\n\n'They should also be wary of investments that don't appear to be liquid, so anything that will tie your money up for a set period and not have a way for you to sell during that time.\n\n'Anything offering supersized returns over a short period is another sizeable red flag, for example an initial return of 20 per cent over two years is very aggressive.\n\n'A high initial investment is another warning. If the minimum is \u00a310,000 or more that will likely rule out the large majority of people, as you want to ensure your money is spread across a range of investments and you don't have too much of your money in one pot, particularly if it's high risk.\n\n'Lots of these kinds of investments will also be time-bound, so will say you need to take advantage in a short space of time before the offer runs out.\n\n'This is a classic sales tactic to make you rush into a decision before you do all of your research \u2013 treat anything like this with extreme caution.\n\n'We've seen a lot of these tactics used in the cryptocurrency market, where people use recommendations from friends or family, are influenced by social media, and feel like they are going to make a lot of money very quickly.\n\n'The simple fact is that investments are a get rich slow system, and unless you're willing to risk losing all your money you should put your money in safer, tried-and-tested investments.'\n\nWhy are we tempted to invest in things we like the sound of?\n\n'There are many behavioural characteristics which can influence people's investment decisions,' says Jessica Exton, behavioural scientist at Dutch bank ING.\n\n'For example, an emotional attachment to an investment can make it appear relatively attractive, or overconfidence that our choices will be better than the average can lead us to predict high returns.\n\nJessica Exton: 'An emotional attachment to an investment can make it appear relatively attractive'\n\n'Cognitive factors can also influence investment decisions, such as focusing on and copying what others are doing, or making decisions based solely on investment past performance.\n\n'However, ING's data shows that many people are unlikely to invest.\n\n'In fact, less than two in five across Europe say they invest in shares and less than one in ten say they invest in so-called alternative assets such as crowdfunding or community investments. Many favour traditional savings accounts or fixed term deposits instead.\n\n'Perception of risk is one driver of this. Alternative investments are considered to be relatively risky, being rated as having more than a moderate amount of risk by two in every five Europeans.\n\n'When making any type of investment it's important to understand the investment product, to think about longer-term performance as well as any short-term expected gains, and to have a few other staples such as debt repaid, a rainy-day fund available and retirement contributions considered first.'", "description": "'Gazza the Movie', a proposed documentary about the life of footballer Paul Gascoigne, is a major eyecatcher as a potential investment.
