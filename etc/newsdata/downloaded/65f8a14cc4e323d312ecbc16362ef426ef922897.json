The nightlife is vibrant too, ranging from romantic dining to live music.\n\nSanya has beautiful beaches and a tropical climate, which makes it a perfect place to kick back and relax.\n\nBut for thrill-seekers, there\u2019s lots of fun and adventure to be had too - on land, at sea and even up in the air; helicopter rides can be taken from nearby Phoenix Island and the views offer a whole new perspective on this tropical destination and places to visit.\n\nOr via sea, there\u2019s plenty more coastline to enjoy; take a 30-minute boat ride to the fantastic Wuzhizhou Island, a particular centre for lovers of water sports.\n\nGuang Feng Jiang works for the diving department on Wuzhizou Island:\n\n\u201cIt's a famous tourism destination in China. We\u2019ve got nice scenery, clear waters and white sands, against a blue sky.\n\n\"We have many water sports here, more than 30 different kinds. For example, there's scuba diving, motor-boating and parasailing.\u201d\n\nBeneath the surface, there\u2019s a whole new world; coral reefs with teeming marine life set in these warm waters.\n\nWen Zhang is a Chinese tourist who found her diving coach to be very patient:\n\n\u201cHe took me into the water bit by bit. I saw very beautiful scenery. There were many colourful fish and corals as we dived down further, then there were shellfish too.\n\n\"The water was very clear. It's my first time in Sanya and first time diving. It was a really good experience.\"\n\nHeading back to Hainan island, there's more fun to be had up in the mountains including trekking through the rainforest and climbing waterfalls in the Yanoda Rainforest Cultural Tourism Zone.\n\nAfter the exertion, many might feel they've earned a night out!\n\nMany head back to the coast to catch a stunning sunset - and equally stunning seafood.\n\nOne such couple are Chris McDonald from Scotland and Sofya Batalova, originally from St Petersburg in Russia. They now both live and work in Sanya, Chris as a DJ and Sofya as a dancer.\n\nA particular favourite for them is dining on a yacht in Sanya's marina - and sampling the sushi.\n\nChris said it's a great experience:\n\n\u201cIt certainly is wonderful to come to a beautiful marina like this and have a delicious meal. It\u2019s always enjoyable.\u201d\n\nSofya agreed: \"It was an awesome meal because sushi is my favourite. I love Sanya. It has great weather and we're on this amazing yacht, so I\u2019m very happy.\u201d\n\nBack on dry land, Sanya\u2019s night scene is vibrant and varied with a big selection of bars, live music and shows. Some of the best places are found in the Baihuagu bar and restaurant area, a favourite tourist spot.\n\nKun Yang, creator of the \u201cHello Sanya\u201d website said the selection is very varied:\n\n\u201cThere are different kinds of food and drinks here. There's Chinese food, western food, seafood, spicy or sweet. It\u2019s good for families and young people. There's something for everyone.\"\n\nSanya is highly recommended for its variety; it's an island destination that offers all sorts of fun and adventures.", "description": "From scuba diving in crystal clear waters, to hiking in stunning mountain scenery, Sanya is a huge favourite with tourists looking for adventure.
