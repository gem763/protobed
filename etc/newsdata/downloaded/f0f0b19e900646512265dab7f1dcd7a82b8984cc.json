Chris teaches us that we are all more than what happens to us. He was someone, not something,\" Little Oak wrote on its website.\n\nChris was a miracle sheep, one that probably should not have survived, the sanctuary says.\n\nWhen he was spotted by hikers in Canberra, Chris' wool weighed double his body weight.\n\n\"He had been living a sad life of isolation with only mobs of kangaroos as his company for an amazing period of five years,\" Little Oak said.\n\nThe sanctuary says that sheep bred specifically for their wool, like Merinos, can't shed and produce wool year round.\n\nShearing sheep helps the animal's health, keeping it cool in summer heat and protecting it against flies and \"wool-blindness,\" damage caused to its eyesight from too long of wool.\n\nAccording to the National Museum of Australia, Chris had only weeks to live when he was found, as his mobility was severely hampered by his heavy coat.\n\nIt was unclear how Chris got loose, and no one ever was able to prove ownership, the museum says.\n\nOnce Chris was brought in for shearing, it took more than 40 minutes. The next year, when Chris had a healthier coat of just 13 pounds, it took only six minutes, Little Oak said.\n\nDespite the neglect for the first half of his life, Chris lived out his days at Little Oak Sanctuary as \"a gentle, character filled chap.\"\n\n\"His bleat was loud and deep, and instantly recognizable,\" the animal sanctuary wrote.\n\nChris' fleece is on display at the National Museum of Australia.\n\nFollow USA TODAY's Ryan Miller on Twitter @RyanW_Miller", "description": "Chris the sheep, who was rescued in 2015, set the record for the world's heaviest\u00a0fleece sheared from a sheep, carrying 90 pounds of wool at the time.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/22/USAT/1c9d01ff-4c64-472e-97be-ed68627bf55e-EPA_AUSTRALIA_ANIMALS_SHEEP.JPG?crop=2931,1649,x0,y123&width=2512&height=1649&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
