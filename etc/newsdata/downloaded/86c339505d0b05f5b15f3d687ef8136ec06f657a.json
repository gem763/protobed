Climate Change Protest", "language": "en", "text": "Left-wing Hollywood stars Jane Fonda and Ted Danson were arrested at a protest against so-called climate change on Capitol Hill Friday afternoon.\n\nThe Washington Post\u2018s Hannah Jewell tweeted a video of Danson in handcuffs and being escorted away by a police officer as attendees of the protest cheered.\n\nHe did it, folks. Ted Danson arrested by the capitol police. pic.twitter.com/tD7lvzgpjF \u2014 Hannah Jewell (@hcjewell) October 25, 2019\n\nIn another video, Fonda, donning a red coat, is seen being taken into police custody. The actress was also handcuffed and led away as onlookers cheered.\n\n@Janefonda was just arrested for the 3rd time calling on climate justice now. This week we are demanding the protection and restoration of our oceans #firedrillfriday pic.twitter.com/knLZod35Yl \u2014 Fire Drill Fridays (@FireDrillFriday) October 25, 2019\n\nFriday\u2019s arrest is Fonda\u2019s third this month. She and Law & Order actor Sam Waterston were arrested outside U.S. Capitol Hill building during a demonstration against global warming last week.\n\nThe actress has pledged to join the protests \u201cinspired and emboldened by the incredible movement our youth have created.\u201d\n\nDuring a CNN interview earlier this month, the left-wing activist said she is prepared to \u201cget arrested every Friday\u201d and floated the idea of bringing governments to \u201ca halt\u201d unless they move to solve so-called climate change.\n\n\u201cThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Crisis told us last year we only have 12 years left. Now it\u2019s 11 years left. We have 11 years left to try to turn this fossil fuel disaster around so that we don\u2019t completely pass the tipping point and it becomes untenable to govern, untenable to have a stable economy, or any kind of human rights or anything,\u201d she told Christiane Amanpour. \u201cThere\u2019s just going to be one disaster on top of another. But we do have time. We have time and it\u2019s going to require people in every country all around the world to organize and mobilize and, if necessary, bring governments to a halt if we can\u2019t make them do the right thing.\u201d", "description": "Left-wing Hollywood stars Jane Fonda and Ted Danson were arrested at a protest against so-called climate change on Capitol Hill.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/janefondadanson1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
