(AP) \u2014 Without a clear Republican favorite for Louisiana governor, President Donald Trump travels to the state Friday for an election eve rally that\u2019s less about the GOP candidates and more a slash-and-burn hit against Democratic incumbent John Bel Edwards.\n\nTrump\u2019s message to voters in Lake Charles will be less precise than traditional get-out-the-vote events. He\u2019ll seek to unite a squabbling Republican Party against the Deep South\u2019s only Democratic governor, trying to keep Edwards from a primary win, while not telling voters which GOP contender to back in Saturday\u2019s election.\n\n\u201cRepublicans must get out and vote for either of our two incredible candidates,\u201d Trump said in one of several tweets about the Louisiana governor\u2019s race.\n\nRepublican loyalties are split among two major candidates: Ralph Abraham, a third-term congressman and physician from rural northeast Louisiana, and Eddie Rispone, a businessman and longtime political donor from Baton Rouge who is making his first bid for office.\n\nAbraham and Rispone each will attend the rally. Both claim long-term support from Trump, even as they quarrel over who backs the president more.\n\n\u201cThe president deeply cares about Louisiana. Louisiana loves President Trump. It is a match that is literally made in heaven,\u201d Abraham said.\n\nThe president is not endorsing either candidate to maximize chances that Edwards will fall below the 50% threshold needed to avoid a runoff, according to a White House aide and a campaign aide, both of whom asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss strategy. Trump plans to endorse whichever GOP candidate makes it to a runoff against Edwards, the aides said.\n\nIn Louisiana, all candidates run against each other, regardless of party, on the same primary ballot. With polls showing Edwards well in the lead, national Republicans have bombarded the state with millions in advertising and visits from Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Donald Trump Jr. to urge anti-Edwards votes and force a Nov. 16 runoff.\n\n\u201cTrump is going to energize the base, the people, the conservatives, make them recognize that we need to do something different,\u201d Rispone said.\n\nPollster John Couvillon thinks such visits will have marginal impact, animating voters who already planned to show up at the polls. He thinks Edwards\u2019 bigger problem is the U.S. House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, stirring up interest from voters in a red state who\u2019ll want to cast their ballots in opposition to anyone aligned with Democrats.\n\n\u201cTo some extent, you can\u2019t entirely escape what has become the stigma of the national Democratic Party here in Louisiana,\u201d Couvillon said.\n\nEdwards isn\u2019t the type of liberal, anti-Trump Democrat with whom the president usually clashes.\n\nLouisiana\u2019s governor is an anti-abortion, pro-gun West Point graduate who avoids criticizing Trump, talks about his strong rapport with the White House and calls the impeachment inquiry a distraction for Washington. He doesn\u2019t focus on party affiliation and tries to avoid national political feuds in a state Trump won by 20 points.\n\nWhile Edwards\u2019 efforts to keep the president at bay in the governor\u2019s race have been unsuccessful, the Democratic incumbent isn\u2019t complaining about the rallies. Instead, he has downplayed them, calling it unsurprising that Trump backs members of his own party in the \u201chyperpartisan\u201d environment of Washington. He said he would continue to \u201cwork well\u201d with the president and focus on his own, bipartisan approach to governing.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the way we have moved our state forward, gotten out of the ditch. I work well with Republicans, with Democrats and with independents, anybody who wants to show up and work in good faith with me,\u201d Edwards said.\n\nHe\u2019ll need that crossover vote to win a second term.\n\nRepublicans nationally have targeted Edwards for ouster since his longshot election victory four years ago. But work to unify around one major contender failed, with the state\u2019s top-tier, well-known GOP officials passing on the race.\n\nNeither Abraham nor Rispone has been able to break away as the top competitor, even as Rispone poured $11 million of his own personal wealth into the campaign.\n\nParty leaders\u2019 efforts to keep the men from fighting each other have failed, raising concerns the backbiting could wound both GOP contenders and help Edwards. Republicans blame attacks among their own candidates for helping to elect Edwards four years ago.\n\n___\n\nFollow Melinda Deslatte on Twitter at http://twitter.com/melindadeslatte", "description": "BATON ROUGE, La.
