I just investigated it for you,\u201d Judge Clemente told the government lawyer. He ordered Michele and Mariana released in the U.S. to await future proceedings, denying the government\u2019s proposal to send them back to Tijuana, Mexico, where they had spent 45 days waiting for this hearing after initially crossing the Rio Grande into Texas.\n\nMichele and her daughter prepared to enter the U.S. Aug. 19 at the crossing in Tijuana, Mexico.\n\nMichele, who spoke on the condition that only her middle name was used, is among some 38,000 migrants placed in the Migrant Protection Protocol program, often referred to as Remain in Mexico, since it began in late January, according to government data. People under 18 traveling without a parent aren\u2019t supposed to be eligible, according to Department of Homeland Security guidelines.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Should the U.S. continue making migrants wait in Mexico until their asylum cases are resolved? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n\nMPP sends migrants who enter the U.S. illegally, or who appear at official places of entry along the U.S. border seeking asylum, to Mexico to await future American court dates. Most of them are from El Salvador, Guatemala or Honduras.\n\nThe Trump administration launched MPP to reduce the number of migrants traveling as families coming to the U.S. to ask for asylum. Before MPP, nearly all such groups were released to inside the U.S. to await court dates.\n\nThe confusion over Michele and her daughter is one example of the problems facing the program. Some migrants miss their U.S. court dates because they are refused entry back into America from Mexico. Critical documents can reach the recipient in Mexico too late.\n\nA U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement bus arrived at immigration court in San Diego carrying Michele, her daughter and her boyfriend.\n\nMPP has grown rapidly and its cases increasingly are taking priority over those of the roughly 975,000 migrants living in the U.S. who await decisions on their immigration claims, some for years.\n\n\u201cIt looks like we\u2019re doing all MPP cases all the time,\u201d Judge Lee O\u2019Connor said in a different San Diego immigration courtroom after telling a man fighting deportation he would have to wait six months for his next hearing. \u201cI don\u2019t know how long that\u2019s going to continue.\u201d\n\nAfter initially hearing most MPP cases in San Diego and El Paso, Texas, the Trump administration has expanded the program to Laredo and the Rio Grande Valley, both also in Texas. U.S. Customs and Border Protection is setting up large tents in those areas for MPP hearings that will start in mid-September, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Migrants will enter from Mexico for the day and talk with immigration judges elsewhere in the U.S. via videoconference.\n\nActing Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan said the MPP program offers asylum seekers a chance at a much faster resolution of their case so they don\u2019t have to wait in limbo in the U.S. \u201cInstead of a five-year process or more, we can see results in a matter of months,\u201d he said during a recent trip to El Salvador.\n\nCentral American migrants at a temporary migrant shelter in San Diego last month.\n\nImmigration advocates say they worry that complex asylum cases will be handled too quickly and migrants won\u2019t have enough time to fully document their claims before a final hearing.\n\nA. Ashley Tabaddor, an immigration judge in Los Angeles and president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, said members of her union are being told by Justice Department officials to hear 80 to 100 MPP cases in a single session that lasts a few hours.\n\n\u201cThe program is expanding exponentially and judges do not believe that this pace is sustainable,\u201d she said.\n\nAt these initial hearings, judges advise migrants on their rights and may ask whether they fear for their safety in retuning to Mexico, but typically don\u2019t ask questions about the cases.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Justice Department office that oversees immigration courts said some non-MPP immigration cases are being rescheduled in San Diego and El Paso to accommodate MPP ones, though the number wasn\u2019t immediately available.\n\nThe brief hearing for Michele and her daughter was one of hundreds held one August week in San Diego. Most of the migrants were ordered back to Mexico to await another hearing in September.\n\nImmigration and civil rights advocates say that stranding asylum seekers in high-crime border cities like Tijuana and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez for weeks or months makes it nearly impossible for them to find lawyers and fully argue their case for asylum.\n\nA chart on the wall of the San Diego migrant shelter lists how many days\u2019 drive or hours of flight to all 50 states.\n\nAdministration officials have said the program maintains due-process rights for migrants regardless of where they are living before their hearings.\n\nOnly about 1% of migrants in MPP hearings have an attorney, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University. Some immigration attorneys want to work with MPP participants, often on a pro bono basis, but are wary of meeting migrants at shelters run by the Mexican government because they aren\u2019t licensed to practice in that country or due to security concerns, said Imelda Maynard, a lawyer for Catholic Charities of Southern New Mexico.\n\nMichele and Mariana are among the few with lawyers. Her 22-year-old boyfriend, Fabricio, Mariana\u2019s father, lacked one. Judge Clemente ordered him to return to Mexico to await his next hearing because his age qualifies him for MPP and he said he didn\u2019t fear going back.\n\nMichele\u2019s attorneys at Jewish Family Service of San Diego said she and Mariana had been transferred to the federal agency that oversees care for migrant minors, but the government wouldn\u2019t disclose their whereabouts. Michele\u2019s relatives in Indiana told her lawyers they believed the two are in a government shelter in Arizona.\n\nA Customs and Border Protection spokesman declined to comment on the case.\n\nDonated shoes at the migrant shelter in San Diego.\n\nOverall, fewer than a quarter of asylum applications are approved each year. Among applicants from the Central American nations of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, from which most asylum seekers in the past year arrived, the figure is less than 15%.\n\nThere are no such statistics for the MPP program, but Syracuse\u2019s TRAC has found 800 such cases that ended with deportation orders and 1,400 in which participants had deportation cases terminated.\n\nJudge Clemente in San Diego told a group of 16 migrants, including Michele and Fabricio, that their recent hearing was the start of what would be a complicated process.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s even more complicated that you are living in Mexico,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is going to be kind of hard for you. But you seem to be very resourceful people. You came a long way and you\u2019re going to have to be resourceful again.\u201d\n\nRelated Video As the migrant crisis on the U.S. border with Mexico intensifies, government agency leaders have been invited to testify before the House Committee on Oversight and Reform.
