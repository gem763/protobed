The Kincade fire in Sonoma county, in the north, had destroyed 124 homes and other structures by Tuesday morning and was threatening 90,000 structures. Crews were also working to control a fierce fire near the Getty Museum in Los Angeles that had prompted evacuations on Monday.\n\nRelated: California wildfires: how bad are they and is the climate crisis linked?\n\n\u201cI know this moment generates a tremendous amount of anxiety,\u201d California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, said on Monday about the two major blazes.\n\nStrong winds were expected to complicate firefighting efforts on Tuesday. \u201cThe worst of this [weather] is coming later today and tonight,\u201d said Marc Chenard, a forecaster with the National Weather Service\u2019s Weather Prediction Center, early on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe winds in the south will really pick up, 50 to 70mph, with some gusts up to 80mph in the Los Angeles mountain area.\u201d\n\nThe so-called Santa Ana winds in the south could hit their worst levels of the season and last into late Thursday, Chenard said, adding that northern California will not be spared either.\n\nUntil at least Wednesday, in the bone-dry wine country about 70 miles north of San Francisco, winds will hit up to 65mph in the mountain areas and 35mph in the valleys and coast, he said.\n\nGiven the strong winds, authorities said at a press conference that many evacuees will probably be unable to return home today.\n\nFresh blackouts\n\nThe latest blackout by Pacific Gas and Electric Corporation (PG&E) started early on Tuesday and was expected to ultimately affect 605,000 customers, about 1.5 million people. The announcement came even before the last blackout had ended, which shut off power to more than 2.5 million people. It was unclear if power that for many went out Saturday would be restored before the next round of outages.\n\nWhat was clear was that patience was wearing thin and frustration at the utility was growing. From the suburbs of San Francisco up north to the wine country, people searched for places on Monday to charge phones and stocked up on ice for the non-perishable food.\n\nIn San Rafael, a city north of San Francisco, traffic had slowed to a stop-and-go crawl because of the power outages.\n\n\u201cSchools have been closed. Nobody can go out and buy groceries. This area is really taking a hit and losing profit,\u201d said Eddie, who declined to give his last name. He had been out of work four days since they cut the lights at the flat house grill where he works, and he was worried about the loss of wages.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t work in San Francisco or certain parts of Marin county, you\u2019re out of luck,\u201d he said.\n\nPG&E, which was driven into bankruptcy because of legal claims over its role in several deadly wildfires in recent years, admitted on Monday that despite the outages, its power lines may have started two smaller fires over the weekend in the San Francisco Bay Area. It has also said its transmission lines may have been responsible for the Kincade fire.\n\nRelated: Wildfire wedding: couple wear protective masks in viral California photo\n\nThe utility has been roundly criticized for its handling of the blackouts, the first of which came early in October. And in a new, 230-page report made public on Monday, PG&E acknowledged \u201csignificant shortcomings\u201d, admitting that its communication with customers and agencies was inadequate.\n\nPG&E stock dropped 24% on Monday to close at $3.80 and was down more than 50% since Thursday.\n\nSouthern California Edison had cut off power to about 800 people as of Monday night and warned that it was considering disconnecting about 400,000 more as winds return midweek. The company also faced a growing backlash from regulators and lawmakers.\n\nUS congressman Josh Harder, a Democrat from Modesto, said he plans to introduce legislation that would raise PG&E\u2019s taxes if it pays bonuses to executives while engaging in blackouts.\n\n\u2018Extreme red flag warnings\u2019\n\nSo-called \u201cred flag warnings\u201d have been in effect throughout the state over the past few weeks, which mean conditions are ripe for fire \u2013 low humidity, high temperatures, swift winds.", "description": "* Kincade fire threatens 90,000 structures as new blackouts planned  * \u2018Extreme red flag warning\u2019 issued in south  Fire near the Getty Museum in Los Angeles on Monday.
