In it, three generations of an African-American family watch TV and wait to hear whether a police officer who Tasered a black, unarmed man dozens of times would be indicted. The discussions mirror those that families across the country must have had in the wake of the grand jury decisions in 2014 over the fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., and the chokehold death of Eric Garner in New York.\n\nTV parents Rainbow and Dre Johnson struggle with whether they should shield their youngest children from the racism that exists within the justice system and let them know that the system is often rigged against minorities.\n\nThe youngest boy wonders whether he could be Tasered. Rainbow tries to reassure him, saying he would be fine if he follows officers\u2019 orders. His grandmother also chimes in saying there are only seven words to know when stopped by police: \u201cYes, sir. No, sir. And thank you, sir.\u201d Dre (with help from his father) knocks down that reassurance citing the cases of Freddie Gray and Sandra Bland, both of whom died in police custody.\n\nIn the process, the episode prompted real folks to have conversations that reflected the deep ones tackled on screen. A former police officer says while police brutality happens, it\u2019s not as widespread as the public may be led to believe. Readers on Facebook talked about whose responsibility it is to end it and how to tackle racism head-on.\n\nRead their comments below, then share your views.\n\nComment from Facebook edited for clarity and grammar:\n\nThis was a great episode of Black-ish. It was truthful and profound. I\u2019m not a fan of the show, but this one resonated with me and my husband. This episode spoke volumes! We aren\u2019t anti-police, but the racism that continues in this country has to stop, and it\u2019s up to the public to speak out any way we can to say, \u201cStop!\u201d\n\n\u2014 Kathy Paxton\n\nLetter to the editor:\n\nIn the recent USA TODAY article about the show Black-ish and the episode on police brutality, Anthony Anderson, who plays father Andre \u201cDre\u201d Johnson, states he was a victim of police brutality when he was a teenager. We have no further insight into these incidents (\u201c\u2018Black-ish\u2019 confronts police brutality in new episode\u201c).\n\nAs a retired police officer with 33 years on the street, I can acknowledge that incidents of overreaction and police brutality do occur, and there are people who do not belong in police work. But they are the exception, not the norm.\n\nFrom a police officer\u2019s view, when a subject fails to acknowledge your authority, you are forced to take a hands-on approach. It\u2019s usually swift and sometimes violent, but that doesn\u2019t make it police brutality. Rule of thumb: as resistance stops, use of force diminishes.\n\nWhite, black, yellow or brown, the best way to avoid a confrontation is to comply with the officer until the situation gets sorted out and adrenaline subsides. It\u2019s called, \u201cDon\u2019t be stupid.\u201d\n\nKarl Grill; Alexandria, Va.\n\nComments from Facebook are edited for clarity and grammar:\n\nThe beauty of today\u2019s police is that they are equal opportunity. They beat blacks, browns, Asians and whites. They are no longer your friends. Black parents are not the only ones who have to explain the senseless brutality that some police departments seem to enjoy dishing out.\n\n\u2014 Rosa Washington\n\nDon\u2019t break the law, and you won\u2019t get shot. Period.\n\n\u2014 Jennie Cooper Franklin\n\nI was deeply moved watching this episode. It was truthful. I am white and have lived through years of supporting, educating and working with individuals from diverse backgrounds as a teacher and a psychologist. We have to work together to keep hope alive. When one of us suffers, all of us suffer. This episode speaks to all of us to stop all racism, and to raise all of us so we can all feel hopeful and have real opportunities. I want to thank the creators, producers and the cast of Black-ish who have told it like it is. Keep the stories coming.\n\n\u2014 Linda Blakeley\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1pvuawz", "description": "\u2018Black-ish\u2019 expands reach with deep dive into controversy", "authors": ["Usa Today", "Published A.M.
