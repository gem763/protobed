And so, it causes a lot of stress in our world.\u201d\n\n...Additionally, the remaining 300 BILLION DOLLARS of goods and products from China, that was being taxed from September 1st at 10%, will now be taxed at 15%. Thank you for your attention to this matter! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 23, 2019\n\nA recent example: A potential resolution in the U.S.-China trade war became more fleeting after Trump announced on Twitter on Aug. 23 that he would be imposing more tariffs on Chinese imports.\n\nAlthough the Chinese government responded by stating that they would not be placing retaliatory tariffs on American goods, Trump\u2019s move still created more market uncertainty for U.S. farmers across the country who are hoping for the trade war to end.\n\nBeijing has targeted past retaliatory actions against American agricultural products like soybeans, pork, corn, sorghum and wheat.\n\nTrump\u2019s trade war carries a price\n\nThe U.S. stock market has seen a whirlwind kind of year, and much of it is arguably tied to U.S.-China trade tensions. After Trump tweeted that he would be ordering U.S. companies to start looking for alternatives to China for their business operations, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 700 points on an intraday basis.\n\n\u201cFarmers are small business owners, but unlike many other small businesses, we have so many things that we can\u2019t control like the weather and the normal commodity market situation,\u201d Pjesky said. \u201cBut with his impetuousness, it makes it much more volatile than normal.\u201d\n\nThe Dow has been on a ride in 2019. (Photo: Yahoo Finance) More\n\nAs trade relations between the U.S. and China remain cool, American farmers have had to rely on aid through the USDA\u2019s market facilitation program. Many farmers have stressed that they want low trade barriers, not the aid.\n\nIn the meantime, U.S. agricultural exports have seen a major hit. Since trade tensions ramped up over the last year, total U.S. dairy exports have been down, with exports to China dropping over 7% year over year. And in 2018, U.S. soybean exports were down 98%.\n\n\u201cI would say more people are noticing the impact that the trade war is having,\u201d Pjesky said. \u201c[Trump\u2019s] support is waning in some ways, but we don\u2019t have a lot of other options, so it\u2019s just something we\u2019re having to deal with.\u201d\n\nPrices have fallen for farmers across the country. (Photo: AP Photo/Sue Ogrocki) More\n\nIn early August, after the U.S. Treasury declared China a currency manipulator, Chinese companies responded by stopping the purchasing of U.S. agricultural products. One farmer described it to Yahoo Finance at the time as \u201cjust another nail in the coffin.\u201d", "description": "President Trump's volatile tweets about trade keep sending reverberations around the markets, and farmers are feeling some of the pain.", "authors": ["Adriana Belmonte", "Associate Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/HVJTB4bsieLjf.QcdLF.3Q--~B/aD0xNTgwO3c9MjE3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/9ccfb630-cffb-11e9-bd7d-b3f545dace59", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
