Climate Strike March in Washington, D.C., September 20, 2019. (Erin Scott/Reuters)\n\nLondon\u2019s Metropolitan Police arrested over 800 climate change activists this week throughout the city, some of whom attempted to shut down London City Airport on Thursday.\n\nDemonstrators with Extinction Rebellion, a climate activism movement that says it encourages civil disobedience to compel government action, have cropped up around London over the past four days. Activists said they planned a \u201cHong Kong-style occupation of the terminal building,\u201d a reference to pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong who shut down the city\u2019s international airport in August.\n\nThe group targeted the London airport over the travel hub\u2019s \u00a32 billion expansion plan, which activists say does not comply with Britain\u2019s goal to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\nAt least 29 people have been charged with crimes. The protests have so far not forced the airport to close but have caused some delayed flights.\n\nOne protester, former Paralympic cyclist James Brown, even climbed on top of a British Airways plane. Another activist refused to resume his seat on a plane as the flight was preparing to depart and began lecturing the other passengers on climate change before police removed him from the plane for \u201cdisruptive behavior on board,\u201d the airline said.\n\nNot sure he\u2019s in the right seat number #londoncityairport pic.twitter.com/jpUIbBM0tu \u2014 Jonathan Mew (@jonmew) October 10, 2019\n\nThe London protests come as climate change emerges at the forefront of the political debate in the U.S.\n\nLast month, Swedish teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg gave remarks before world leaders at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York City, accusing the assembled heads of state of having \u201cstolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth,\u201d Thunberg said.\n\nMeanwhile, Extinction Rebellion has organized five days of protests this week in New York City and around the U.S. One such demonstration outside the New York Stock Exchange featured protesters lying in pools of fake blood.", "description": "Activists said they planned a\u00a0\"Hong Kong-style occupation of the terminal building.\"", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Jim Geraghty", "Victor Davis Hanson", "John Mccormack", "A.
