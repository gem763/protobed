Why is that a bad thing if the movie does lead to a discourse about it?\u201d\n\nCritics have accused \u201cJoker,\u201d starring Joaquin Phoenix, of promoting real-world violence and painting the notorious supervillain as a hero. Last week, families of the victims who were killed during a Batman movie at a theater in Aurora, Colorado, in 2012 wrote a letter to Warner Bros. demanding that the studio donate profits to gun-victim charities.\n\nWarner Bros. defended the film, explaining in a statement that one of the functions of storytelling is to \u201cprovoke difficult conversations around complex issues.\u201d\n\nIn his interview, Mr. Phillips lamented that outrage had become a \u201ccommodity,\u201d and that both sides of the political aisle shared the blame.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s outstanding to me in this discourse in this movie is how easily the far left can sound like the far right when it suits their agenda,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really been eye-opening for me.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t make the movie to push buttons,\u201d he said. \u201cI literally described to Joaquin at one point in those three months as like, \u2018Look at this as a way to sneak a real movie in the studio system under the guise of a comic book film.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t, \u2018We want to glorify this behavior.\u2019 It was literally like \u2018Let\u2019s make a real movie with a real budget and we\u2019ll call it f\u2013ing Joker.\u2019 That\u2019s what it was.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
