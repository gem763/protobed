The rally had been billed as a discussion of government\u2019s role in society, and was held in the downstairs room of a public library in Peterborough, south-east New Hampshire.\n\nIt was an inauspicious start to the two days the Guardian spent with Sestak, 67, who is spending three weeks campaigning in New Hampshire \u2013 including walking 105 miles (169km) across the state \u2013 as he seeks to build momentum for his little-known campaign to take on Donald Trump in the race for the White House in 2020.\n\nBut it was also an insight into the difficulty that even seemingly well-qualified candidates have in breaking through the noise of a densely populated Democratic field, and the money and effort spent on campaigning that runs under the radar.\n\nSestak, 67, spent four years in the House of Representatives, representing a traditionally Republican Pennsylvania district, until 2010. He announced his run for the presidency on 23 June. Before this New Hampshire sojourn, he had spent three months in Iowa, holding 235 events, driving 17,000 miles (27,000km) and, according to his campaign, \u201cshaking nearly 30,000 hands\u201d. He started his ramble across New Hampshire on 13 October, and is planning to cover 105 miles (169km) in eight days.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Joe Sestak, a two-term congressman, announced his run for the presidency on 23 June.

Both states vote in three and a half months. A Quinnipiac nationwide poll released on Monday also bore bad news. Of 1,195 registered voters, Sestak was the choice of \u2026 0%.\n\nOn the same day, Sestak met Allen in Peterborough, the 12 leading Democratic candidates were debating in Ohio on CNN. The audience was 8.3 million: disappointing for CNN, but priceless exposure to someone like Sestak.\n\nYet, to his credit, Sestak persevered with his one-person crowd in Peterborough. He\u2019d walked there, after all \u2013 seven miles, from Dublin. Sestak\u2019s staff will pick him up and drive him to some of his farther-flung New Hampshire events, but he plonks a stick in the ground at the end of each walk, and starts there again the next day.\n\nThat same persistence was eventually rewarded at his Peterborough event, when, after speaking to Kath Allen and three journalists for half an hour, a second person showed up. And after listening to Sestak, Allen was impressed.\n\nHe had answered her questions about senior care, and healthcare \u2013 he prefers the centrist Medicare-for-all-who-want-it-style plan, rather than the more progressive, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders proposal of Medicare for All. He had confidently fielded queries from the latecomer, about nuclear power. (He is in favor, but wants to use thorium reactors, not uranium.) But Allen wasn\u2019t planning to vote for him, and she was skeptical about whether he will be the Democratic nominee.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he can get it,\u201d Allen said. \u201cPeople want the flamboyant. And he\u2019s not well-known.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like other candidates, I like Tulsi, I like Joe. I really like what Joe has to say on most of the things,\u201d Allen said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m gonna see how this plays out.\u201d\n\nBy the time Sestak entered the race, most of the other candidates had been running for months. (John Delaney, a businessman and three-term congressman, had been running for almost two years.)\n\nSestak announced his candidacy late because he was caring for his daughter, who had been diagnosed with cancer for a second time. Happily, she is now in recovery, but his late entry means other candidates have pulled ahead. It goes without saying that his rivals have drawn larger crowds. Some 15,000 people attended an Elizabeth Warren rally in Seattle in August, and her campaign said 20,000 came out to an event in New York City in September.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sestak is planning to cover 105 miles (169km) in eight days as he campaigns in New Hampshire.

He promised to keep it short, and started with a joke.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m actually in the debate tonight,\u201d Sestak told the crowd.\n\n\u201cCongratulations!\u201d someone said. They sounded surprised.\n\n\u201cOnline,\u201d Sestak said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a live stream, in a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts.\u201d\n\nSestak had used the same gag at the Peterborough library, where Allen had been halfway out of her chair going for a high five before he dropped the punchline.\n\nAs promised, that night Sestak held his own online debate. He answered the same questions posed to the candidates on stage, live from a Dunkin\u2019. Sestak was sitting quite far away from the camera and it was difficult to hear him. At 9.57pm, just three people were watching the live stream on Sestak\u2019s Facebook page, and the Guardian was one of them.\n\nPart of Sestak\u2019s problem may be that he is a centrist, white, older man, in a field with plenty of centrist, white, older men. Sestak\u2019s USP, though, is his foreign policy experience and, given the chance, he ties it well to other aspects of the presidency.\n\nClimate change, for example. Sestak tells voters the US could pass the Green New Deal \u2013 the sweeping progressive proposal to tackle the climate crisis and inequality through economic reform \u2013 but it won\u2019t make a difference to rising temperatures, given 80% of emissions come from the rest of the world.\n\n\u201cWe need someone who can unite this country and convene the world,\u201d Sestak says, promising to bring the country together in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nThe Guardian met Sestak again the day after the debate, in Peterborough, where he had planted his stick on Tuesday. He had 18 miles (29km) to walk on Wednesday, and he expected to be on the road until 11pm. We set off walking east, uphill, at a fast pace, Sestak wearing black hiking boots. He walked across Pennsylvania in 2015, when he campaigned for the Senate \u2013 he lost in the primary \u2013 and believes the benefits outweigh any potential pain.\n\n\u201cIt seems to be catching a little bit,\u201d he said of his campaign. As well as walking and meeting people, Sestak is running a TV ad campaign in New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cWe see people who are seeing our ads. It\u2019s coming to a point of once you know I\u2019m out here serving, trying to serve you, and they\u2019re interested.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018I wouldn\u2019t go through this if I didn\u2019t think we have a possibility of winning,\u2019 said Sestak as he walks across New Hampshire. Photograph: Mark Lorenz/The Guardian\n\nSestak doesn\u2019t regret entering the race late. But he agrees he missed out on early exposure.\n\n\u201cWould my position have been enhanced if I had got in earlier? With the town halls happening, I think it would be a bit easier,\u201d Sestak said. With his lower profile, his campaign has been told by some of the main networks that they won\u2019t book him for interviews \u2013 even on foreign policy, despite his experience.\n\nHe raised almost $375,000 in the third quarter of 2019, a total that pales in comparison with the $25m Warren raked in, or even the $2.3m raised by Steve Bullock, the Montana governor running at a more Sestak-esque 0.2% in national polls, but not a bad start.\n\nThat fundraising total, combined with his polling, means he is highly unlikely to meet the threshold for the next televised Democratic debate in November. But, marching uphill in New Hampshire, Sestak told the Guardian he had no plans to drop out.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t go through this if I didn\u2019t think we have a possibility of winning,\u201d he said.\n\nHe had an additional 16 miles (26km) to go that day \u2013 a long way, but nothing compared with the distance he has to make up if he is to be the Democrat\u2019s choice in the race for the White House.", "description": "A two-term congressman\u2019s campaign demonstrates the difficulty hopefuls have in breaking through the crowded field", "authors": ["Adam Gabbatt"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/077b74d23f38a5765e898a2934f1004d635b0871/0_55_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=23234bdd30574278873cd284b34701b7", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
