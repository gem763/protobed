I didn't mean to offend people. I can see that I have done a big mistake. The comments are not appropriate.\"\n\nShe said she was tweeting in her own capacity and not on behalf of the institution.\n\n\"I didn't mean to bring the institution into disrepute. I can't take it back rather than to apologise profusely. It was a mistake. I didn't think at the time and it was done in my own personal capacity.\n\n\"I have apologised for embarrassing Unisa. I humbly apologise and it was a mistake. I am embarrassed. I didn't think at the time. By speaking to you, I am concerned that I won't make things worse for me.\"\n\nMckay, whose tweets are protected, offered her apology on the social media site soon after speaking to News24.\n\n\"I am deeply apologetic about my comments regarding book money issued to students of higher education in South Africa. I was in error in what I said and I hope that people can forgive me. I did not mean to create harm and I am embarrassed that I did. Please accept my apologies,\" she wrote.\n\nUnisa was not immediately available for comment, however, the institution earlier tweeted it was aware of an academic staff member who made derogatory remarks on Twitter toward NSFAS-funded students.\n\nThe university said it strongly rejected and condemned such behaviour.", "description": "A senior lecturer at the University of South Africa has apologised for \"embarrassing herself\" after lashing out at National Student Financial Aid Scheme recipients at the institution on social media.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8344/dbb133d1e48049ca8357566a7b91c980.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
