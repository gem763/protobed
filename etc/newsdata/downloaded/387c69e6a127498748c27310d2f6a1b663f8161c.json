The storm threatened to dump 6 to 12 inches of rain, with isolated maximum amounts of 18 inches across the upper coastal region of Texas, including the Houston and Galveston areas.\n\nImelda made landfall near Freeport, Texas, on Tuesday afternoon. The National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning for the coast of Texas from Sargent to Port Bolivar. Forecasters said an isolated maximum of 18 inches of rainfall \"may produce life-threatening flash floods.\"\n\nAs of 4 p.m. local time, Imelda was located 30 miles west of Galveston and 30 miles south-southeast of Houston, the hurricane center said. It was moving north at 7 mph with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph. Imelda will continue to move farther inland across eastern Texas later Tuesday and into Wednesday.\n\nPotential rainfall totals from Tropical Storm Imelda as of Tuesday, September 17, 2019. NOAA\n\nJeff Lindner, a meteorologist for the Harris County Flood Control District in Houston, said the main threat from Imelda remained the potential for heavy rainfall and flooding. Lindner says while there is the potential for some isolated structure flooding in the Houston area, widespread house flooding \"doesn't look likely at this point.\"\n\n\"We have a few things in our favor. The ground is dry. It's been dry for a while here as we've come through summer,\" Lindner said. \"The initial parts of this rainfall will go toward saturating the ground.\"\n\nSome parts of Harris County and neighboring Galveston County had already received 2 to 3 inches of rain through Tuesday morning. In a tweet Tuesday, Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner asked residents to be \"alert and weather aware.\"\n\nRain will be in the area over the next several days and could cause some flooding. Be careful driving and please pay attention to the weather reports. Be alert! st \u2014 Sylvester Turner (@SylvesterTurner) September 17, 2019\n\nGovernor Greg Abbott on Monday placed numerous resources on standby across Texas. The Texas Division of Emergency Management will be rostering four boat squads in coastal areas. The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department will be moving boats to support the Beaumont area and adjacent regions.\n\nMeteorologists also said newly formed Tropical Storm Lorena in the Pacific Ocean could produce heavy rains and flooding in Mexico by Thursday.\n\nBermuda issues hurricane warning for Humberto\n\nMeanwhile Tuesday, forecasters said Hurricane Humberto in the Atlantic Ocean is posing a stronger threat to Bermuda, though it was still hundreds of miles away.\n\nA hurricane warning has been issued for Bermuda as Humberto moves closer to the island. The hurricane center said Tuesday that Hurricane Humberto has grown a little stronger, with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph. Now a Category 2 hurricane, Humberto could become a major hurricane late Tuesday or Wednesday.\n\nHumberto is about 450 miles west of Bermuda, heading east-northeast at 12 mph. Forecasters say hurricane conditions are expected Wednesday night or Thursday morning in Bermuda and Humberto could cause flooding along the southern coast.", "description": "Imelda made landfall near Freeport, Texas, on Tuesday afternoon", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/17/bae96c31-0ddd-4ebb-8349-31ac2b9f5a48/thumbnail/1200x630/5986e87c0fd0c4925d2e40df0b35c6e9/screen-shot-2019-09-17-at-4-40-42-pm.png", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
