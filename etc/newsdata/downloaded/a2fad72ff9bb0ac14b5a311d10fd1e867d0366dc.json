The monthly U.S. is due today. US30USD Daily Chart US30USD Daily Chart The US 30 index slumped to the lowest since August 28 yesterday before rebounding strongly to close higher for the first time in three days The index briefly traded below the 200-day moving average at 25,930 but closed above it. That moving average has held on a closing basis since August 14 Expectations are that the U.S. economy added 145k jobs in September, more than the 130k posted in August. However, the weak ADP on Wednesday and unimpressive employment indices in the recent PMI releases could suggest that the downside may be vulnerable. DE30EUR Daily Chart DE30EUR Daily Chart It was a similar story for the Germany30 index, which felt pressure early on only to recover and finish in the black for the first time in three days The index edged toward the 200-day moving average at 11,813 but it remained untested, as it has been since August 29 In a statement yesterday, the EU Parliament said it had grave concerns about new UK Brexit plan since it does not \u201ceven remotely\u201d work for the Irish border. There are no data releases scheduled for today for both Germany and the Euro-zone.
