European officials have threatened to block the project from moving ahead on the continent. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, is set to appear on Capitol Hill next week to discuss the plans.\n\nSuper-sovereign currency\n\nFor Beijing, Libra has provided another urgent motive for digitising the currency. China blocks Facebook's platforms within its borders, but Chinese leaders see in Libra the potential start of a new world financial system, one that could bulldoze the traditional authority of governments and central banks \u2014 China's included.\n\n\"If Libra is accepted by everyone and becomes a widely used payment tool, then after some time, it is entirely possible that it will develop into a global, super-sovereign currency,\" Mu Changchun, a top official at China's central bank, said in a recent online lecture. \"We need to plan ahead to protect our monetary sovereignty.\"\n\nThe idea of a national virtual currency is hardly new. Central bankers in Britain, Singapore and Canada have conducted experiments on how digital tokens might be integrated into the financial system. A European Central Bank board member said last month Libra was a \"wake-up call\" that had revived the bank's electronic payment efforts.\n\nBeijing's interest in the subject is just as long-standing, even if China has for years restricted the use of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies within the country.\n\nThe People's Bank of China started a cryptocurrency research group in 2014, and as early as 2016 the central bank's then-governor Zhou Xiaochuan mused about issuing a digital coin. But in 2017, as bitcoin's value soared and speculative frenzy raged, China shut down cryptocurrency exchanges and cracked down on fundraising through virtual coins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter that, officials continued to discuss a government-controlled digital currency in speeches and articles, and after Libra was announced, China declared it was accelerating its efforts.\n\nSecretive plans\n\nChinese officials have said little about when the project might start becoming a reality. At a news conference last month, Yi Gang, the central bank's governor, said the new coin would replace only a portion of the cash in circulation. The central bank did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nFacebook's Libra has been a wake-up call, reviving China's digital currency plans. AP\n\nChina's proposed currency shares some elements with Facebook's, though aspects of Beijing's plans may not yet be firmed up.\n\nFacebook says Calibra, its digital wallet for holding and spending Libra, will require identity verification, and the company is vowing to use your financial data responsibly. It says it will not, for instance, take note of your pain reliever purchases to push Instagram ads for clinics.\n\nChina has suggested that it, too, will keep spending information away from marketers \u2014 but not from the authorities. The banks and electronic payment companies that will distribute the new digital currency already require users to authenticate their names and identities. And officials have made clear that the central bank will be able to view data on transactions.\n\nChinese consumers have for years paid for everything with their phones, and the country's two dominant mobile payment services, Alipay and WeChat Pay, have become pillars of the Chinese economy. Alipay says it has processed as many as 256,000 payments per second. By comparison, Visa says it can handle 65,000. Libra is promising to do 1000, at least at the start.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut many transactions on the Chinese platforms move exclusively between digital wallets, never making contact with the state-dominated banking system. That means the Chinese government has to go through the platforms' privately owned parent companies, Ant Financial and Tencent, if it wants to track and scrutinise those movements.\n\nNot so with the new e-currency.\n\n\"This is highly controlled, manageable and decided by the central government,\" said Gary Liu, an economist in Shanghai. \"This is very different from the original concept of a cybercurrency.\"\n\n'Controllable anonymity'\n\nChinese officials use something of an oxymoron to describe what their new currency will offer: \"controllable anonymity\".\n\n\"As long as you aren't committing any crimes and you want to make purchases that you don't want others to know about, we still want to protect this kind of privacy,\" Mu, the deputy director of the central bank's payments department, said in another recent online lecture on China's cryptocurrency plans.\n\nClamping down on the true anonymity that paper money allows could bring real benefits in a country where corruption and fraud are widespread. But the government also risks alienating people in China who have grown increasingly sensitive to how their personal data is collected and used.\n\n\"Currencies should be neutral,\" said Flex Yang, founder of Babel Finance, a Hong Kong-based provider of financial services for cryptocurrencies. Their value, in other words, should not depend on whether they are being spent on bread or on cigarettes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Without anonymity, it can't be considered a currency,\" Yang said. \"It can only be a payment vehicle.\"\n\nChinese officials have indicated that their aim is less to copy Libra than to get ahead of a potentially momentous shift in the global financial order.\n\nPandora's box\n\nBeijing has long wanted China's currency, the yuan, also called the renminbi, to be used more in international trade and finance. If Libra proves convenient for moving money across borders, then it could become a currency of choice in many countries, particularly those with unstable economies.\n\nFormer central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan warned Libra might erode the economies of nations with \"weak\" currencies. Bloomberg\n\nIn a speech in July, Zhou, the former central bank governor, said the dominance of the dollar had eroded the economies of nations with \"weak\" currencies, and he warned that Libra and other future currencies might someday do the same.\n\n\"We need to prepare in advance to make the renminbi a strong currency,\" he said.\n\nChina's leaders would also love to have an alternative to SWIFT, the Western-dominated messaging network that helps money move across borders and between banks. Western governments have previously restricted access to SWIFT to punish Iran for its nuclear program, and as Washington and Beijing feud over trade and security, the Trump administration has considered sanctions of various kinds against Chinese companies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA digitised yuan is not likely to become the world's new favourite currency overnight. China tightly regulates conversions of the yuan into other currencies to keep exchange rates stable, and similar strictures are likely to bind the crypto-yuan.\n\nRegardless of whether Libra ends up thwarted by regulators, Facebook has set something unstoppable in motion, said Deng Jianpeng, a professor at Central University of Finance and Economics in Beijing.\n\n\"They were the first to open this Pandora's box,\" he said. \"Once this box has been opened, if it isn't issued or doesn't succeed, there will definitely be another company that issues one or that succeeds in the end.\"\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "The Chinese government's long-held plan to replace cash with a digital currency have been given a jolt by Libra - and officials could soon know a lot more about how citizens spend their money.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2648%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_67/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/05e4332ab6e24bddbc05f51b03952ea8babbdc17", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
