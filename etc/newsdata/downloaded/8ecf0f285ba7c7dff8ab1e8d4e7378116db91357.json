A manager can feel lucky if he has one man with that ability in his team. Raheem Sterling makes a stadium fizz. So does Jadon Sancho.\n\nThe Borussia Dortmund winger got the crowd off their seats in England\u2019s 5-3 victory over Kosovo at St Mary\u2019s. Sterling was again the creative hub of Gareth Southgate\u2019s team but Sancho shared the burden. The 19-year-old even chipped in with two goals, scored in the space of two minutes just before half time. Sterling is almost unplayable unless opposing sides double-up on him \u2013 sometimes they even triple-team the Manchester City man. You cannot afford to do that with Sancho on the pitch. He will exploit the freed-up space and beat men. Against a double-edged wing attack like this, no defence can keep its shape.\n\nKosovo couldn\u2019t. After falling behind early to Valon Berisha\u2019s opening goal \u2013 Michael Keane\u2019s assist making it easy for the Lazio forward \u2013 England composed themselves. Much of their attacking impetus came from the left flank but Sancho, on the right, was always a threat. This is a confident young man who learnt his trade in the caged pitches of south London. He has an appetite for destruction - he wants to humiliate opponents with flamboyant acts of skill. It has made him one of the hottest properties in Europe.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Sancho started brightly, spinning inside, away from his marker, head up, looking for a pass. It was a statement of intent.\n\nSometimes he can be a bit too bold. Just after Sterling\u2019s equaliser, Sancho took a clearance level with England\u2019s 18-yard line and tried to dribble out, despite the proximity of three Kosovo defenders. The ball rebounded off one of them and went out for a throw. It was just as well because England could not afford another mistake on the edge of their box.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

After a slick interchange on the halfway line, he took off for goal. Although he overran the ball, he followed the pursuit through to put pressure on the goalkeeper. All his energy and appetite were on display.\n\nSancho has the same knack as Sterling of freezing defenders when he has the ball at his feet. That was vividly illustrated in the area when he shimmied and danced in front of two mesmerised Kosovans before stroking a pass to Ross Barkley for the Chelsea midfielder to curl the ball just wide.\n\nHarry Kane put England in front and suddenly the Three Lions were rampant. Sancho then had the chance to show another component in his character. A Kosovan went down on the halfway line and while his team-mates screamed for England to put the ball out of play, the winger headed goalwards.\n\nHe turned Florent Hadergjonaj inside out before banging in a cross from the byline that M\u00ebrgim Vojvoda could only bundle into his own net.\n\nThe Kosovans were furious and Valon Berisha faced up to Sancho before the restart to give the young man a piece of his mind. Sancho was not intimidated by the Lazio midfielder and gave as good as he got.\n\nHis two goals came in a wild two minutes before half time. On each occasion, Sterling grabbed the attention of the entire Kosovo team and while they were watching the 24-year-old, Sancho was lurking on the opposite flank waiting for his moment.\n\nFirst, Sterling advanced to the edge of the area and sent the ball crossfield to where Sancho waited at the back post. He took two touches and looked to have missed his opportunity but, with a coolness that belies his age, he slotted the ball past Arijanet Muric.\n\nFor his next trick, Sterling sped into the area, drew the goalkeeper, shaped to shoot and then flicked the ball to Sancho, who gratefully accepted the chance. During the celebration, the apprentice pointed to the sorcerer in glee but while Sterling may have been the catalyst, it was clear another attacking threat was emerging for England.\n\nSancho still has a lot to learn. Midway through the first half, the winger switched off when Jordan Pickford got possession from a Kosovo attack and meandered upfield. He was unaware that Trent Alexander-Arnold was in possession on his outside and when he looked inside to see who was carrying the ball, Sancho realised his mistake. He did a quick, embarrassed pirouette and rejoined the play.\n\nThat learning process will continue in the Bundesliga and he is bound to see plenty of playing time for England. Manchester United made a serious attempt to sign him during the transfer window but Sancho\u2019s representatives were keen that he develop in a more stable environment than Old Trafford can offer at the moment.\n\nMarcus Rashford gave England more discipline and solidity against Bulgaria on Saturday but, for all the United forward\u2019s strengths, he never set the crowd alight. Sancho does that. Southgate is a lucky manager.", "description": "A buzz goes around a ground when certain players get the ball.
