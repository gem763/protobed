Sam Upshaw Jr., Louisville Courier Journal\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Four years before Pete Buttigieg launched his attempt to become the first person to leap from a mayor\u2019s office to the White House, he was invited to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nAt a forum for \u201csmart cities,\u201d Buttigieg helped launch a new initiative to spur innovative solutions to local problems.\n\nHe\u2019d long envisioned South Bend, Indiana, as a \u201cbeta city\u201d the perfect size to use his data-driven background with the consulting firm McKinsey to test big ideas.\n\n\u201cThe dream is to actually have a real-life version of Sim City at my fingertips,\u201d he told Fortune magazine after the White House launch of the MetroLab Network in 2015.\n\nAs Buttigieg increasingly draws distinctions between himself and the frontrunners for the Democratic nomination \u2013 as he did during a feisty appearance at last week's debate \u2013 he told USA TODAY the approach he took in Indiana reflects the arguments he\u2019s making for why his presidential message is better.\n\nIn contrast with former Vice President Joe Biden \u2013 who said when he announced his campaign that \u201cAmerica\u2019s coming back like we used to be\u201d \u2013 Buttigieg counters that \u201cwe\u2019ve got to find a new future.\u201d\n\n\"I don't agree that there's any such thing as back to normal,\" Buttigieg said during the debate.\n\nBut despite his start-up mentality, Buttigieg is not selling himself as the biggest disruptor.\n\nThe test-it-out approach he took in South Bend, he said, demonstrates why boldness has to be combined with pragmatism instead of pugilism on issues like Medicare for all, where he is split from his more liberal counterparts Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not afraid to stand, or even fight for, what I believe in,\u201d Buttigieg told USA TODAY. \u201cBut when you hear the word 'fight\u2019 so many times, it starts sounding like fighting is the point. That\u2019s where I think we\u2019re at risk of losing our way.\u201d\n\nMayor of South Bend, Indiana and candidate for president Pete Buttigieg campaigns at Sparks High School on Sept. 28, 2019.

It used to be bigger. With an economy historically shaped by the makers of cars and metal products, the city lost a quarter of its population in the 1970s and 1980s as manufacturing declined.\n\nWhen Buttigieg launched his presidential campaign in April, he did it from a former Studebaker factory. Shuttered in the 1960s, the six-story vehicle assembly plant that redevelopers call a monolithic shadow of the past is being turned into what could be the largest mixed-use technology campus in the Midwest.\n\nButtigieg says the plant illustrates how progress isn\u2019t made by using resentment and nostalgia to sell an impossible promise of returning to a bygone era, but by working toward \u201csomething totally different.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could argue that the entire industrial Midwest is in some ways like the Studebaker plant,\u201d Buttigieg told USA TODAY when asked if there\u2019s a national equivalent. \u201cHuge untapped potential. A lot of legacy costs. A lot of things we gotta fix. But a chance to take what we\u2019ve always had and find new value in it.\u201d\n\nSouth Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg speaks as he announces his presidential candidacy for 2020 during an event on Sunday, April 14, 2019 in South Bend, Indiana.

But we talk about the permission to believe in ourselves as the first piece of actually doing something.\u201d\n\nButtigieg also hired recent graduate Santiago Garces, first through enFocus and then directly as the city\u2019s first chief innovation officer \u2013 a post unusual for a city of South Bend\u2019s size.\n\nGarces, who is now director of innovation and performance for the city of Pittsburgh, found working with Buttigieg exciting but demanding.\n\n\u201cI think he sees governing as a kind of moral activity that requires going back to what is good and bad and trying to reframe the decisions in terms of what is good for society,\u201d Garces said. \u201cAs an engineer, sometimes you\u2019re like, `Oh my god man! Would you just tell me what you want!\u2019 But, in the end, you end up betting a better result.\u201d\n\nAnd those results led to national, and international, attention.\n\nPhotos: This is what South Bend looks like after Mayor Pete Buttigieg's time in office\n\nSupporters for Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg march during the Polk County Democrats Steak Fry, Saturday, Sept. 21, 2019, in Des Moines, Iowa.

And Pete recognized that,\u201d said Lawrence Greenspun, director of public sector engagement for Drucker.\n\nMore than a dozen cities have since used a management training program for public employees created with South Bend\u2019s collaboration and Drucker is now piloting a lifelong learning initiative there with seed funding from Walmart and Google.\n\nThe goal is to give every resident easy access to the education or training programs that they need in a fast-changing economy.\n\nPete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Ind., signs an autograph after his campaign rally at Lyons Four Square Park on Tuesday, Sep. 24, 2019, in Clinton. (Photo: Kelsey Kremer/The Register)\n\nTest it out\n\nButtigieg said the willingness he showed in South Bend to try something new \u2013 but to test it out first \u2013 helps explains why he doesn\u2019t back as big a transformation in health care as the government-run Medicare for all approach favored by Warren and Sanders. Under what he calls his \u201cMedicare for all who want it\u201d plan, people would have the choice of joining a government health program or staying with an employer-sponsored or individual private insurance coverage.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about the biggest innovation in U.S. health care since the innovation of Medicare itself,\u201d he said. \u201cBut also, I\u2019m not assuming that it\u2019s going to work for everyone right away. Which is why I think it\u2019s so important not to force people onto it.\u201d\n\nLikewise, some of his other proposals \u2013 such as his plans to address racial inequities, boost rural communities, combat climate change and improve mental health services \u2013 include efforts to unlock what\u2019s happening at the local level.\n\nDuring the debate, Warren countered that Medicare for All is the \u201cgold standard,\u201d arguing that Buttigieg\u2019s plan wouldn\u2019t make health care affordable for everyone.\n\nBiden disputed that he\u2019s used the words \u201cback to normal\u201d and said one of the reasons he\u2019s running is because of his age and experience.\n\n\u201cWith it comes wisdom,\u201d he said.\n\nPaullina Mills, a substitute teacher in Iowa who attended a Buttigieg town hall in Ames the day after the debate, said she\u2019s not concerned about Buttigieg\u2019s limited experience in higher office. Mills, who said she decided just a week ago that she would caucus for Buttigieg, added that the mayor\u2019s experience as a Navy intelligence officer is also important context.\n\n\u201cExperience is always a good thing, but it\u2019s not necessarily a deal breaker,\u201d she said. \u201cObviously it\u2019s not a necessity to be an experienced politician to be elected president, if Donald Trump can do it. So I think he has the necessary experience, and then some.\u201d\n\nAlthough some mayors whose endorsements are highly prized haven\u2019t yet picked a candidate, they have plenty of compliments for Buttigieg.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very highly regarded among his peers, very much considered a thought leader\u2026and an action leader,\u201d said Steve Benjamin, the mayor of Columbia, S.C., and the immediate past president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors where Buttigieg launched in 2018 an effort to help cities deal with the effects of increased workforce automation.\n\nWhen Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti created in 2017 a national initiative to scale and replicate local solutions to economic insecurity, he had his pick of mayors wanting to be part of \u201cAccelerator for America.\u201d Garcetti chose Buttigieg as one of the founding board members and choose South Bend as the launching pad. Through the program, South Bend has created a template for taking advantage of new federal opportunity zones meant to spur investment in lower-income areas.\n\nGarcetti isn\u2019t ready to back a candidate. But the mayor of a city 40 times the size of South Bend said he doesn\u2019t have a problem envisioning Buttigieg making the giant leap to the White House\n\n\u201cWhenever people have thought the stage is bigger, perhaps, than he could be on, or should be on,\u201d Garcetti said, \u201che\u2019s always been able to show them he absolutely is ready.\u201d\n\nContributing: Barbara Rodriguez of the Des Moines Register.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/10/20/pete-buttigieg-mayoral-record-differences-biden-warren/3976814002/", "description": "Pete Buttigieg says the \"beta city\" approach he took in South Bend shows why he'd take a different approach to the White House compared with the top contenders.", "authors": ["Maureen Groppe", "Published A.M.
