It has breathtaking views, a private mountaintop hiking trail and three luxury rental units that sit high off the ground among red oaks and birches.\n\nFor a $99 entry fee and an original nature-themed photo, it could all be yours.\n\nWhen most property owners are ready to move on, they rely on the traditional real-estate market. A few are going a more unusual route and turning to sweepstakes-style competitions to drum up interested takers.\n\nFor the win\n\nAs with any other gamble, the contests\u2019 appeal lies in the potential payoff. The winner of the treehouse getaway, TimberStone Adventures, is promised the property and $25,000.\n\n\u201cWhere are you going to get a better deal than getting an entire resort?\u201d said owner Josh Ring, 39 years old.\n\nMany of the owners have had trouble selling their properties the traditional way. Mr. Ring and his family had their property, which he said is profitable, listed on the market for $1 million for a year.\n\nSuch a contest crowdfunds a property\u2019s sale. If enough people enter, the entrance fees amount to something close to the desired sale price. If too few people enter, the contest is usually canceled and contestants get refunds. That threshold can range from 100 contestants to thousands.\n\nMr. Ring is seeking at least 9,900 applicants, amounting to $980,100 in entrance fees. Mr. Ring declined to comment on how many entries have come in since the competition\u2019s launch on Aug. 1.\n\nHowever, any such contest can\u2019t be one of chance\u2014that would be an illegal lottery. That\u2019s why the fee is matched with a challenge like a photo submission.\n\nMr. Ring was inspired by a similar contest in Lovell, Maine, a few miles down the road from his family\u2019s resort. The Center Lovell Inn & Restaurant has found new owners through an essay contest twice, once in 1993 and again in 2015.\n\nThe current owners, Prince and Rose Adams, won the 19th-century farmhouse with an essay about why they wanted the inn and a $125 entrance fee. The previous owner made more than $900,000 from that contest, according to the Portland Press Herald. The Adamses now value the inn at about $1.5 million.\n\n\u201cWhen you play the lotto, in a sense, you don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to win,\u201d Mr. Adams said. But with a contest, \u201cyou have this pipe dream from the moment of playing it, and that\u2019s what we did.\u201d\n\nThe Center Lovell Inn has found new owners through a contest twice.

Carole Kelaher did the same with her Vermont cupcake shop. Neither attracted enough entrants to move forward.\n\nMichael Hurley hosted a giveaway for his two-screen movie theater in Houlton, Maine, through an essay contest after trying to sell it for 14 years. He had purchased the theater as a short-term investment, hoping to flip it, but its modest profits made it a tough sell.\n\nHis 2015 contest attracted significant media attention, but ultimately, there weren\u2019t enough contestants. \u201cWe didn\u2019t come remotely close to where we needed to be,\u201d he said. Mr. Hurley had set a target of at least 3,500 contestants, enough to generate $350,000 in fees.\n\nThe contest did indirectly lead to a sale. In Mr. Hurley\u2019s email canceling it, he invited participants to make offers. One of them was Charlie Fortier, 56 years old, who had grown up in the northern Maine town and planned to retire there from his job in publishing. He responded with an all-cash offer and now runs the theater. He declined to say how much he paid.\n\n\u201cI wish I\u2019d have won it,\u201d Mr. Fortier said with a chuckle, given the $100 entry fee was considerably cheaper.\n\nShare your thoughts Your property won\u2019t sell. Do you offer it up in a contest? Join the conversation below.\n\nState gambling authorities have occasionally launched investigations to determine whether such contests are unsanctioned lotteries in disguise. The Center Lovell Inn was the target of one such probe in 2015. Earlier this year, the Alberta Gaming, Liquor and Cannabis Commission investigated a letter-writing contest to win a roughly $1.3 million home in Canada. The contest initially went viral, and the commission found the giveaway didn\u2019t violate any of its laws. Homeowner Alla Wagner ultimately canceled it for lack of interest.\n\nScott Schleifstein, a lawyer involved in a current giveaway in Ithaca. N.Y., described the concept\u2019s frequency as \u201csomewhere between a no-hitter and a perfect game.\u201d\n\nPolly Wood, 46 years old, started the contest in Ithaca to give away Toko Imports, a small drum shop she has owned since 2014. (In her case, she\u2019s offering the business with the possibility of a three-year lease; she rents the space.) Her contest is an eight-point questionnaire about contestants\u2019 vision for the store and has a $108 entrance fee.\n\nPolly Wood is offering Toko Imports in Ithaca, N.Y., in a contest.

We need ways to creatively think outside the box.\u201d\n\nMs. Wood hopes her offering is unique enough to draw contestants\u2014a sentiment Mr. Ring of TimberStone Adventures echoed. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to do this for a $200,000 house. This is about uniqueness,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI built a treehouse resort,\u201d Mr. Ring added. \u201cMost people wouldn\u2019t do that either.\u201d", "description": "Owners try unloading their real estate by offering it up in sweepstakes. \u201cThis was more exciting to me than just looking for a buyer.\u201d", "authors": ["Ethan Millman"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107272/social", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
