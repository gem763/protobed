But none were publicly listed by the then mayor.\n\nMore than 1,300 entries are redacted, citing an exemption for personal information \u2013 suggesting Johnson\u2019s liaisons with the businesswoman may have been concealed from public view.\n\nIt comes after Arcuri gave a lengthy interview with ITV in which she failed to deny an affair with Johnson but sought to portray his visits to her flat, which she operated as an office, as business meetings. \u201cI think it was normal that he came to my office like many other tech professionals, government officials did,\u201d she said.\n\nBut the diary makes no mention of any visits to her flat. It only explicitly references Arcuri\u2019s Innotech company twice, despite him speaking at four of the firm\u2019s events. The diary lists an Innotech event in Canary Wharf in April 2013 and another at the Bafta building in Piccadilly in October 2014.\n\nBut it omits the Innotech launch event in 2012 at Hult Business School, where Arcuri studied for an MBA, when Johnson pledged to do everything in his power to help the new tech sector flourish in London.\n\nHis appointments for 30 October 2014 records a \u201cPop in to Google Hangout\u201d but does not mention that Arcuri and her Innotech company were hosting the event. During his appearance, Johnson was videoed telling Arcuri: \u201cI\u2019m always happy to hang out at Innotech.\u201d\n\nOn 28 February 2013 Arcuri told Johnson\u2019s communications director, Will Walden, that she \u201cspoke to the man last night\u201d when she appeared to be trying to book the mayor to speak at one of her conferences.\n\nJohnson\u2019s diary for 27 February 2013 lists eight appointments but the last two on that day are redacted because they relate to personal information about the mayor. They are two of more than 1,300 redactions under section 40 of the Freedom of Information Act, which allows for an exemption of the release of personal data.\n\nOn Monday, Arcuri told ITV that she met Johnson up to 10 times in her Shoreditch flat and on other occasions in public bars and cafes.\n\nShe denied that Johnson, or his officials, exercised any favouritism towards her in the awarding of public money and access to trade trips during his time as mayor.\n\nShe refused to state whether she was having an affair with Johnson and suggested he visited her because he wanted to learn about technology. \u201cHe really wanted to understand more about what was happening in California and what tips we could learn from the west coast,\u201d she said.\n\nSo detailed are parts of the diary \u2013 entries include departures on bicycle rides around London, as well as \u201cchats\u201d with various people \u2013 that the failure to disclose meetings with Arcuri raises further questions. The diary contains no mention of \u201ctechnology lessons\u201d, which Arcuri reportedly told a friend she was giving to Johnson in her flat.\n\nBy contrast, Johnson\u2019s diary includes other meetings with key technology players, including a 2014 meeting with Joanna Shields, the then chairman of Tech City \u2013 a job Arcuri unsuccessfully applied for, reportedly using Johnson as a reference. Arcuri denied that he had written her a letter in the ITV interview.\n\nThe diary is also littered with meetings Johnson held with London & Partners (L&P), the mayor\u2019s promotional agency, which granted Arcuri\u2019s business \u00a311,500 while the prime minister was in City Hall. The diary includes 12 meetings with Gordon Innes, L&P\u2019s chief executive.\n\nIn total, Arcuri\u2019s companies were granted more than \u00a3126,000 in public money, including \u00a3100,000 from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, which is now subject to an investigation over whether the firm was eligible.\n\nIn 2012, Johnson was ordered by the information commissioner to publish a fuller version of his official diary after previously failing to disclose conversations with News International executives at the height of the phone-hacking scandal.\n\nDowning Street declined to answer why Johnson\u2019s meetings with Arcuri were not listed in his diary, referring the Guardian to his interview last month in which he claimed \u201ceverything was done in accordance with the [Greater London Authority\u2019s] code [of conduct]. Everything was done with full propriety.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Number 10 refused to clarify whether any of Johnson\u2019s meetings with Arcuri were among those redacted. Johnson has insisted he had no interest to declare over Arcuri and his register of interests includes no reference to her or companies.", "description": "Official mayoral diary contains more than 1,300 redactions and no public reference to friend", "authors": ["Matthew Weaver", "Simon Murphy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f87068e9e2a01de14b6ac44f5d67005b3989b61e/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b6c8c72ede0f174dbe276c49fd670823", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
