The Californian also suffers from a perception that she lacks a deep ideological well to guide her policy ideas, in contrast to her three main rivals who are better-defined. And her past as a prosecutor has earned her supporters and detractors.\n\nHarris and Senator Cory Booker \u201creally went after Vice President Biden -- it rebounded to their detriment that they went after Biden so much. Because it also looked like they were not just going after Biden, but they were going after the Obama legacy,\u201d said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, which is neutral in the primaries.\n\nWeingarten said many Democrats left the June debate thinking, \u201cKamala seems really feisty and let\u2019s look at her.\u201d But in the July debate they were turned off by Harris and other aggressors because \u201cit looked like they were burning the house down, as opposed to building on what Democrats believe in.\u201d\n\nHarris surged from about 7% to 15% in averages of Democratic polls immediately after the first debate in late June, putting her in second or third place in the crowded field. But it was a sugar high \u2014 she\u2019s back to the 7% she had when summer began.\n\nFor Harris, the danger is that she\u2019s another Marco Rubio. The Florida senator, too, had a potentially history-making candidacy during the Republican nomination battle in 2016 and was hailed by the party establishment as presidential timber, before he failed to translate that on the ground.\n\n\u201cOur focus is on winning the primary, not an off-year August news cycle, which is why we\u2019ve spent the summer building the grassroots organizing foundation that will propel Kamala to victory in this race,\u201d Harris spokesman Ian Sams said in an email. \u201cThese races are marathons, not sprints, and Kamala is a long-distance runner.\u201d\n\n\u2018Too Flippy-Floppy\u2019\n\nIn late July, Harris backed off her previous support for replacing private insurance with a national government plan and released a proposal that preserves the option for private plans, positioning herself ideologically between Sanders and Biden on one of the most contentious issues in the race.\n\nBut rather than placating both wings, the move drew fire from all sides \u2014 the Sanders campaign accused her of going soft, Biden charged her with \u201cdouble talk,\u201d and voters were left wondering what she stands for.\n\n\u201cToo flippy-floppy. I just don\u2019t like her,\u201d said Debby Fisher of Richmond, California \u2014 near Harris\u2019s hometown of Oakland \u2014 who plans to support Sanders.\n\nSuzanne Cowan of San Francisco said she soured on Harris after her change on health care.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not my kind of candidate. Either you know what issues you support and you have the courage to stand up for them or you don\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cFor me she\u2019s \u2018I\u2019ll be in favor of whatever is trending\u2019 \u2014 and that doesn\u2019t cut it.\u201d\n\n\u2018Her Brilliance, Her Passion\u2019\n\nPatrick Kollar of Roy, Washington, who recently attended a Warren rally in Seattle, said he\u2019s unsure how to define Harris ideologically.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cI follow politics pretty closely and I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s about.\u201d\n\nHarris has set herself apart on culturally salient issues like immigration and gun control with far-reaching legislative proposals and executive actions to tackle two high priorities for Democratic voters. At the same time, she has downplayed ideological labels and branded herself as the \u201c3 a.m. agenda\u201d candidate who\u2019s focused on problems that keep Americans up at night.\n\n\u201cI lost my son to gun violence,\u201d said Lynette McElhaney of Oakland, adding that she was drawn to Harris\u2019s aggressive positions on gun control. \u201cAnd critically important, she sent her staff to stand with me when my son was killed in Los Angeles.\u201d", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Kamala Harris entered the presidential race with impressive credentials -- a popular black woman with an inspiring story who hailed from a large Democratic state and drew accolades for her fiery questioning of President Donald Trump\u2019s nominees.Yet despite a shot of adrenaline after confronting", "authors": ["Sahil Kapur"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/x5k_UzAVntTYdbGdY_MPhg--~B/aD00ODU7dz03MjA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/edd4c2fec374bbafd161c8f82ef8b5c8"}
