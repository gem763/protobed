Those numbers are even worse for women of color, who made up just 4% C-suite executives in the survey.\n\nMore women than before are being hired for director-level jobs and higher, and women in senior-level roles are generally being promoted at higher rates than their male counterparts, the study found.\n\nEven as hiring and promotion improve for women at senior levels, women can never catch up, the study says. There are too few women to advance.\n\nDespite this mostly upward trend at the top \u2014 representation of women in the C-suite dipped one percentage point between 2018 and 2019 \u2014 women are still \u201csignificantly under-represented\u201d at all levels, the study found, making up only one in five executives in the C-suite.\n\nWomen aren\u2019t leaving their workplaces in greater numbers than men, the study found. They are also on par with men when it comes to asking for promotions and raises.\n\nRather than pointing to a \u2018glass ceiling\u2019 that thwarts ambitious women from climbing to the top, the study suggests the biggest problem lies with a \u201cbroken rung\u201d from entry- to manager-level roles. Just 72 women for every 100 men are promoted and hired as managers, according to the study, resulting in some 62% of manager roles being occupied by men and just 38% being filled by women.\n\nWomen of color are disproportionately hampered by the so-called broken rung: Only 58 black women and 68 Latinas for every 100 entry-level men get promoted to the manager level, while 64 black women and 57 Latinas for every 100 men are hired as managers.\n\nIn fact, women of color, women with disabilities, lesbian and bisexual women report \u201cby and large worse\u201d experiences on the job than women on average. Black women and women with disabilities overall say they have received less manager support and less sponsorship than women in other groups.\n\nWomen of color, women with disabilities, lesbian and bisexual women report worse experiences than other, getting promoted less than other women.\n\nThese early disparities for women overall carry long-term consequences, the study said. \u201cSince men significantly outnumber women at the manager level, there are significantly fewer women to hire or promote to senior managers.\n\nThe number of women decreases at every subsequent level,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cSo even as hiring and promotion rates improve for women at senior levels, women as a whole can never catch up. There are simply too few women to advance.\u201d\n\nMending that broken rung, they argued, will trigger \u201ca positive chain reaction.\u201d Still, a majority of companies don\u2019t appear to be implementing remedies where they might make the most impact: Just one-third of companies set gender-representation targets for first-level manager jobs, versus the 41% that set such goals for senior-level management roles, according to the study.\n\nBusinesses should set more aggressive goals for boosting women\u2019s numbers in first-level management gigs, the authors recommended. Companies should also mandate a diverse lineup of job candidates at all levels \u2014 including the manager level \u2014 and make workers give entry-level performance reviews \u201cunconscious-bias\u201d training to reduce potential bias, the report added.\n\nThe authors further suggested having \u201cclear evaluation criteria\u201d (like a rating system) in place before candidates are evaluated, and ensuring that women receive the necessary experience and exposure to be considered for managerial positions.\n\n\u201cThe building blocks to make this happen are not new \u2014 leadership training, sponsorship, high-profile assignments \u2014 but many companies need to provide them with a renewed sense of urgency,\u201d they wrote.", "description": "Just 72 women for every 100 men are promoted and hired as managers, a new study says.", "authors": ["Meera Jagannathan"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT350_leanin_ZG_20191015141643.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
