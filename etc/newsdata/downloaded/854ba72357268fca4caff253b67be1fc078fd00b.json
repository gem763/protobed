The euro EURUSD, -0.0629% remains intact and Draghi is widely if not universally credited with ensuring its survival, but he also leaves amid controversy and division over the policies he championed and the way he carried them out.\n\nDraghi took the helm of the Frankfurt-based ECB in November 2011 just as the eurozone debt crisis was deepening. In July 2012, with Italian and Spanish government bond yields trading at or near unsustainably high levels, Draghi delivered an unscripted pledge at a London event:\n\n\u201cWithin our mandate, the ECB is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd believe me, it will be enough.\u201d\n\nDraghi then proceeded to lead the ECB in fashioning an emergency bond-buying program that went well beyond anything the central bank had used previously and which could be used in an emergency. The program, known as outright monetary transactions, or OMT, was never used, but its existence, and the work toward fashioning it, served to calm the storm. Yields on the debt of the eurozone\u2019s most vulnerable governments returned to sustainable levels which was just as well given Italy as the eurozone\u2019s third largest economy was too big to bail out.\n\nMoreover, Draghi sent a message about the political will to avert a breakup of the euro. The drama underlined Draghi\u2019s skills as a communicator. Over the years, he polished a reputation for his ability to jawbone, or verbally guide, financial markets, including the euro exchange rate.\n\nIn 2015, Draghi overcame opposition from Germany and its northern European allies to persuade the ECB to implement quantitative easing \u2014 the creation of money to buy bonds \u2014 in an effort to stimulate the eurozone economy and push stubbornly low inflation back up toward the ECB\u2019s annual target of near but just below 2%. The ECB also pushed its deposit rate into negative territory.\n\nIndeed, Draghi\u2019s \u201cindividual confidence and conviction played a key role in extending the ECB\u2019s toolbox, including to QE (quantitative easing), an instrument that had remained largely uncertain in the euro area given the lack of a fiscal counterparty,\u201d said Anatoli Annenkov, economist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, in a note.\n\nWhile Draghi is praised for helping to save the euro, he\u2019s been fiercely criticized for low interest rates and their effect on savers. German tabloid Bild responded to the ECB\u2019s decision last month to push the deposit rate further into negative territory with a photo illustration of a fanged Draghi with the headline: \u201cCount Draghila is sucking our accounts dry.\u201d\n\nGood Morning from Germany, where Draghi's rate cut & mon bazooka have triggered devastating echo. Even newspapers like ZEIT & SZ, who were prev in favour of #ECB's MonPol, criticize Draghi.

It\u2019s already taken steps via a tiering system to mitigate the effect of a negative deposit rate on banks. Economists warn of potentially hitting a \u201creversal rate\u201d where negative rates become a drag on the economy by incentivizing banks to cut lending and households to save more. Draghi\u2019s drive to the September decision also laid open rifts within the Governing Council.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s exhaustion around Draghi\u2019s own leadership style.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported at least seven members of the 25-member body, including his closest aide and the heads of the French, German, Dutch and Austrian central banks opposed the plan to restart the ECB\u2019s bond-buying program.\n\nIf the ECB is out of ammunition, that might mean that Draghi\u2019s successor, Christine Lagarde, a former French finance minister and former managing director of the International Monetary Fund, will need to use her political skills to persuade Europe\u2019s politicians to use fiscal policy and step up public spending and investment.\n\nThose concerns also illustrate how Draghi\u2019s efforts ground against the euro\u2019s own design flaws as well as broader concerns around the role of central banks in the global economy.\n\nThe ECB, like the Federal Reserve and other major global central banks, has been referred to as the \u201conly game in town,\u201d meaning that politicians have been reluctant to pursue expansionary fiscal policies in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Instead, the argument goes, they were content to let central bankers take the lead in staving off a deeper crisis while criticizing them for their extraordinary steps.\n\nIn the case of the ECB, Draghi and his colleagues stepped into a vacuum. Individual euro members control their own purse strings. There is no eurozone-wide finance ministry.\n\nThe broad problem for central banks, wrote economist Michael O\u2019Sullivan in \u201cThe Levelling: What\u2019s Next After Globalization,\u201d is that they may have \u201csimply delayed the reckoning of deep-seated economic fault lines, failing to boost economic potential while creating new risks in financial markets and the international economy.\n\nBut economist Barry Eichengreen of the University of California, Berkeley, said the resentment stoked by the ECB was \u201cunavoidable\u201d. No to have acted when fiscal policy makers failed to respond would have been \u201cirresponsible.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf a fire breaks out and the local fire department doesn\u2019t respond, the neighboring fire department has the choice of standing by idly \u2014 creating the danger that the fire may spread to its own neighborhood \u2014 or driving across town and doing what the local fire department should have done in the first place,\u201d Eichengreen said, in an email interview. \u201cWhat recommendation would you give that neighboring fire department?\u201d", "description": "Mario Draghi is credited with saving the euro and building the ECB into a much more powerful institution, but he leaves it divided amid doubts over what\u2019s...", "authors": ["William Watts", "Deputy Markets Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT829_draghi_ZG_20191023090501.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
