Consider a statewide rent cap that Democrats rushed through the legislature this week.\n\nCalifornia already boasts the highest housing costs in the country, and even liberals have come around to acknowledging that not enough homes are built to meet demand. The state has added about half as many housing units as needed to accommodate population growth, and more than half of Californians spend 30% of their income on rent.\n\nBlame a thousand regulatory burdens. Local governments limit what housing developers can build and where. They layer on permitting fees, and then there are the state\u2019s high labor costs and expensive green-energy mandates and restrictions that opponents can exploit to block projects for years.\n\nLast year state regulators mandated solar panels on new homes. Cities are increasingly prohibiting natural gas hookups as they try to block fossil fuels. The San Luis Obispo City Council voted last week to charge developers a $6,000 fee for every new housing unit that isn\u2019t all electric.\n\nThe upshot is that an \u201caffordable\u201d housing unit in California costs $332,000 to build and nearly $600,000 in San Francisco, according to state budget figures. Developers can\u2019t turn a profit on low- and middle-income homes despite abundant federal and state subsidies.\n\nDemocrats have ladled out billions of dollars for housing in this year\u2019s budget, and voters in 2017 approved $3 billion in general obligation bonds for low-income housing. Gov. Gavin Newsom has also threatened to sue cities that don\u2019t meet their state-mandated zoning quotas for affordable housing.\n\nAnd now Democrats want to constrain housing prices by fiat. Mr. Newsom and Democratic legislators are pushing a law to limit annual rent increases across the state to 5% plus inflation. Rent increases have been slowing, but nearly 50% of units in San Francisco and the East Bay would have been capped in 2015 and 40% in 2016.\n\nAfter businesses complained that the rent cap would discourage new development, Democrats agreed to exempt units built in the last 15 years. But who can trust that progressives won\u2019t broaden the cap in the future? Some liberal groups are already pushing a ballot initiative next November to let local governments expand rent control.\n\nThe rent cap could encourage landlords to increase rents up to the limit each year rather than respond to the market. Landowners might also decide it\u2019s more profitable to convert buildings to condos, which would further limit the stock of rentals. The biggest harm so far has been to increase uncertainty for developers. Building permits in the first seven months this year have fallen 17% compared to 2018 despite an increase in state subsidies. The only other times permits have plunged by this much were during recessions.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s progressive regulatory complex is contributing to this housing slowdown by driving businesses and people from the state. More than 700,000 residents have left since 2010, and many more will head for the exits if progressives have their way and the cost of living in sunshine keeps rising.", "description": "First California makes homes unaffordable, then it imposes statewide rent control.", "authors": ["The Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106410/social", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
