Their 13 industry groups declared spending a further \u20ac128m in the same period.\n\nIn total, between 2010 and 2018 the companies and their lobbying industry bodies have spent at least \u20ac251.3m on lobbying activities within EU institutions, according to the report by Corporate Europe Observatory, Food & Water Europe, Friends of the Earth Europe and Greenpeace.\n\nThe researchers say the figure represents the tip of the iceberg, as in some years companies made no declarations of spending in the voluntary register. The report also does not examine lobbying spending by each company relating to national parliaments and institutions.\n\nAnalysis of the European commission\u2019s public record of meetings shows the oil firms and their industry groups employ 200 lobbyists in Brussels, who have held 327 meetings with top EC officials since 2014, when Jean-Claude Juncker took office \u2013 the equivalent of more than one meeting per week.\n\nAt the same time, the profits of the big five have continued to rise to more than $82bn (\u00a362m) in 2018.\n\nPascoe Sabido, researcher at Corporate Europe Observatory, said: \u201cBig polluters like Shell, BP and their lobby groups have delayed, weakened and sabotaged EU action on the climate emergency thanks to their hefty lobby spending. A cool quarter of a billion over the last decade buys a lot of access and influence in Brussels.\u201d\n\nThe report comes after the Guardian\u2019s Polluters series, which revealed that 20 oil and gas companies \u2013 including BP, Shell, Chevron, ExxonMobil and Total \u2013 can be directly linked to a third of greenhouse gas emissions since 1965. The companies \u2013 which include multinationals and state-owned firms \u2013 are continuing to expand their operations and driving the climate emergency, despite having been aware for decades of their industry\u2019s devastating impact on the planet.\n\nThe report says the lobbying has succeeded in watering down EU climate legislation. Lobbying, it says, peaks at times when legislation is being drawn up. The oil and gas companies, and their industry groups had high spending in 2014 during the discussions over the EU\u2019s 2030 climate targets, when they spent \u20ac34.3m on lobbying the EU institutions.\n\nThe report says the climate targets were weakened as a result; they included no binding energy savings target and included a \u201cwoefully inadequate\u201d renewable energy target.\n\nThe Guardian recently revealed how the car industry and big oil companies are the most negative influencers on climate policy of all the top 250 biggest investor-owned industry and their trading associations.\n\nThe NGOs behind the report are demanding that politics be freed from fossil fuel influence. In a call, supported by 200 civil society organisations, they said they wanted to see an end to the fossil fuel industry accessing decision making. They are calling for:\n\nan end to lobbying meetings with fossil fuel and their representatives\n\nno revolving door between public office and the oil and gas industry\n\nthe end of fossil fuel subsidies\n\nno sponsorships or partnerships with industry representatives\n\nThe call to set up a firewall between the fossil fuel industry and democratic politics comes as pressure is growing on the oil and gas industry. The US Congress held a hearing on Wednesday examining the oil industry\u2019s efforts to suppress the truth about the climate emergency.\n\nIn New York, a supreme court trial opened this week examining allegations that ExxonMobil misled its investors about climate change.\n\nIn the UK, BP and Shell have faced a growing backlash. This month the Royal Shakespeare Company announced it was ending its sponsorship deal with BP and the National Theatre said it would end its Shell sponsorship in the new year.\n\nSebastian Mang, climate policy adviser for Greenpeace Europe, said: \u201cBig oil and gas are causing death and destruction in exchange for eye-watering profits. But millions of people are calling them out, as they face trial for their role in fuelling the climate emergency \u2026 It\u2019s time our governments hold them to account.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Chevron said: \u201cWe lobby ethically, constructively and in a nonpartisan manner. We lobby in accordance with all laws. Chevron brings expertise on many issues that can be valuable to elected public officials and their staffs. Our goal is to contribute to economic prosperity through sound policy.\u201d\n\nShell said: \u201cWe firmly reject the premise of this report. We are crystal clear about our support for the Paris agreement, the European commission\u2019s vision to achieve EU climate neutrality by 2050 and the steps we are taking to help meet society\u2019s need for more and cleaner energy.\n\nExxonMobil said: \u201cExxonMobil, like many companies, non-governmental organisations and other entities, engages with the European institutions. We have a responsibility to our customers, employees, communities and shareholders to engage in a public policy dialogue that impacts our business.\u201d The company said it complied with the requirements of the EU transparency register.\n\nTotal said national and international trade groups had an important role in discussions on how the Paris climate agreement goals could be met \u2013 for example through carbon pricing, which Total supported.\n\nBP did not respond to a request for comment.", "description": "Report comes amid calls for set up of firewall to protect politics from industry influence", "authors": ["Sandra Laville"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5625e8b99bd00a7b36db2c71f3ecb248077cb593/4_250_5105_3063/master/5105.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c50079122612b18f95f11b52f0bc62fc", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
