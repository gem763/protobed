His daughter Nancy is on the line. She wants to know if he will be free to come and see her awarded a school prize. \u201cI\u2019ll be there, darling,\u201d he assures her. \u201cI\u2019ve almost finished all these hideous interviews.\u201d\n\nFor the past week, and for the first time in more than three years, Cameron has barely been off the airwaves or out of the media. The hideous interviews have come thick and fast. Some of the headlines they have made have been calculated, like the settling of scores with Boris Johnson and Michael Gove over Brexit. Others have been inadvertent, like the revelation that Cameron lobbied for the Queen to \u201craise an eyebrow\u201d about the Scottish independence campaign during the referendum in 2014.\n\nAt his launch party on Tuesday, the former prime minister joked that there were two hardback bestsellers being published this month. \u201cOne\u2019s a book about a riven society and a dangerous dictatorship,\u201d he told guests. \u201cAnd the other\u2019s by Margaret Atwood.\u201d His own book, it is clear from our interview, has a wider purpose. Three years after his premiership collapsed in the wake of the vote to leave the EU, Cameron is trying to regain the right to be heard, above all on Brexit and on the referendum that swept him from office.\n\n\u201cI totally understand that there will be some people I will never convince, who will say you should never have had it,\u201d Cameron says of the 2016 vote. He knows that millions of remain voters blame him viscerally for everything that has happened since then and probably always will. \u201cBut I think there are a lot of people who can also see that there was a growing inevitability about having a referendum and, yes, there was a problem in the Tory party, but the relationship with the EU was a far bigger one. Britain\u2019s position was becoming more tenuous, and we had to fix it. I hope that I can convince people that it was an honest and thought through attempt to deal with the issue.\u201d\n\nThis is the nub of the case that weaves its way right through the 700 pages of Cameron\u2019s memoir and through much of what he has said in interviews this week. The UK\u2019s relationship with the EU was always both necessary and contingent, he argues. Until now, every prime minister for the last 40 years has simultaneously wanted a seat at the top table and a special deal for Britain. Every one of them, even Tony Blair, felt they had to fight off moves to political union. \u201cThese weren\u2019t pretend ghouls and ghosts,\u201d Cameron says. \u201cThey were real.\u201d It\u2019s a useful reminder that Cameron, so often dismissed as an insouciant optimist, is at heart a very practical politician.\n\nHe is insistent that British ambivalence has origins that long predate the migration crisis or the rise of Nigel Farage. Cameron traces the roots back to Margaret Thatcher\u2019s support for the EU single market in the 1980s. \u201cThe single market was both the best thing and the worst thing for Conservatives. We created it. But then we didn\u2019t like the legislation that was needed to make it work.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe EU is a law-based organisation that doesn\u2019t like exceptions,\u201d he continues. \u201cThe differing speeds issue had to be addressed, especially with the eurozone.\u201d Cameron thinks the balancing act would have had to continue even if remain had won in 2016. He quotes the downbeat assessment of an anonymous official (surely the Bank of England deputy governor, Jon Cunliffe) telling him \u201cit would have kept us in the EU for another 10 years\u201d.\n\n\u201cMy biggest regret\u201d, he says, is that he let expectations about his 2015-16 renegotiation get too high. \u201cI should have made it clear that some of the things my colleagues were arguing for were not available \u2013 picking and choosing which laws to obey, radical cuts in the budget, some sort of country club membership. These things are not possible.\u201d He thinks there was more substance to the renegotiation deal he brought back from Brussels in February 2016 than is now acknowledged. The concessions he achieved were \u201ca big deal for the EU. They hated it.\u201d\n\nSome of that defiant confidence drains away when Cameron talks about the referendum process itself. He thought \u201ca lot\u201d about writing a enhanced majority threshold into the referendum legislation, but it never happened. \u201cI agonise about that one.\u201d He thought the Electoral Commission \u201cgot it wrong\u201d by insisting the choice on the ballot was between remain and leave, not yes (Cameron wanted a yes-to-Europe campaign) and no. He had always thought June 2016 would be the optimum date. Now he is not so sure. \u201cWe lost the vote so it\u2019s worth asking the question.\u201d He is scathing about Labour\u2019s role in the campaign under Jeremy Corbyn. \u201cThey were awol.\u201d\n\nCameron\u2019s own stance on Europe has not changed three years on. \u201cI\u2019m a remainer,\u201d he says, without equivocation. And it is as a remainer, albeit a pragmatic one, that he has watched events unfold \u2013 and now unravel \u2013 since he walked away in July 2016.\n\nHe says supportive things about Theresa May. \u201cShe was definitely a moderniser.\u201d But his disagreement with her Brexit strategy is barely concealed. He approves of the fact that \u201cshe got a deal\u201d. He \u201cshares her frustration\u201d that it was then voted down by \u201cthe people who most wanted Brexit\u201d. But, crucially, he says that \u201cpicking one of the existing models, a Norway-style model, would have been a safer and more secure way to deliver Brexit while safeguarding the economy.\u201d\n\nAnd he is critical of her failure to adapt her strategy after the 2017 election. \u201cIf you think about it like that, then the red lines, the election result and not reaching out more until too late to other support have had an impact. You need Labour support for a partnership Brexit. If you go back to the beginning, to 2016 and particularly after 2017, you might have been able to get more buy-in. The government went in a different direction, with the red lines and all the rest of it.\u201d\n\nAnd, now, today, under the very different leadership of Boris Johnson? Cameron\u2019s answer may surprise many, since he admits he is open to a second referendum if Johnson fails to make a deal. \u201cI think it is more difficult now. Logically, where we are is either Boris gets his deal and brings it back and passes it, or there are three options: you can find another deal, you can have a general election, or you can have a second referendum. We\u2019re running out of ways to get unstuck what is stuck.\n\n\u201cI think the first choice is to deliver the first referendum with a deal. But I\u2019m not keen at all on no deal. That would be a big risk for the country. But if we get stuck, it [a second referendum] should be an option and it shouldn\u2019t be ruled out. I think we\u2019re better off in, trying to fight for Britain\u2019s interests rather than trying to form a partnership which I think we could make work but which isn\u2019t the answer.\u201d\n\nCameron\u2019s memoir ranges wide across many issues. He remakes the case for his Tory party modernisation project during the opposition years from 2005 and for the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition\u2019s austerity programme after 2010. Though he admits that \u201csome of the early speeches were a bit \u2018Hello birds. Hello trees.\u2019\u201d he is convinced that his 11-year leadership has been hardwired into \u201ca modern compassionate Conservative party\u201d. The book also contains some very good anecdotes about everything from Brussels summits to visiting Balmoral. Many who read the pages on the death of his son Ivan in 2009 will be moved to tears.\n\nIn the end, though, everything in Cameron\u2019s story always comes back to Brexit. \u201cIt is very difficult to try to put Brexit to one side because it\u2019s so massive,\u201d he admits. But he sticks to his fundamental argument about his defining legacy. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t some cranky view that there would have to be a referendum. The idea that this was just a Tory party drama, a Tory obsession, is not correct. Yes, it was a particularly big problem for the Conservative party and the pressure was growing and growing. But I was wrestling with a genuine problem.
