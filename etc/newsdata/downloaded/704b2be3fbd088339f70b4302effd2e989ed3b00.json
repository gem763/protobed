Oil rises on hopes of extended OPEC production cuts\n\nTOKYO, Sept 10 (Reuters) - Oil futures rose on Tuesday,\n\npotentially heading for a fifth day of gains, amid optimism that\n\nOPEC and other countries may agree to extend production cuts in\n\na bid to support prices.\n\nBrent was up 42 cents, or 0.7%, at $63.01 a barrel\n\nby 0104 GMT, while U.S. crude was 46 cents, or 0.8%,\n\nhigher at $58.31 a barrel.\n\nU.S. oil gained more than 2% on Monday, while Brent finished\n\nthe day 1.7% higher as the market reacted to the appointment by\n\nSaudi Arabia's king of his son, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, as\n\nenergy minister on Sunday. Prince Abdulaziz, a long-time member of the Saudi delegation\n\nto the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC),\n\nsaid the pillars of Saudi Arabia's policy would not change and a\n\nglobal deal to cut oil production by 1.2 million barrels per day\n\nwould be maintained. He added that the so-called OPEC+ alliance between the OPEC\n\nand non-member countries including Russia would be in place for\n\nthe long term.\n\nA meeting of OPEC and OPEC+ countries this week in Abu Dhabi\n\nthis week \"is stirring up hopes for additional supply cuts,\"\n\nsaid Stephen Innes, Asia Pacific market strategist at\n\nAxiTrader.\n\nStill, Russia's oil output in August exceeded its quota\n\nunder the OPEC+ agreements. Should oil end Tuesday higher it will be the longest run of\n\ngains since late July but headwinds remain as the U.S.-China\n\ntrade war rumbles on.\n\nExecutives at the annual Asia Pacific Petroleum Conference\n\nsaid on Monday they expect oil prices this year to be pressured\n\nby uncertainties surrounding the global economy, the U.S.-China\n\ntrade war and increasing U.S. supplies.", "description": "Oil rises on hopes of extended OPEC production cuts", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEAAN05K_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
