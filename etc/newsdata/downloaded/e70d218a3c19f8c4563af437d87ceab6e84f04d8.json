But China has fought back on American requests.\n\nPillsbury declined to comment to The Times, but said, \"It appears tariffs alone are not enough, but we also need to meet some of the Chinese demands to get the kind of deal the president wants.\"\n\nThe trade-war has been a central issue throughout Trump's presidency and tariffs scheduled to go into effect next week.\n\nThe Hill has reached out to the White House for comment.", "description": "The Trump administration is\u00a0discussing\u00a0ideas for further economic crackdowns on China in order to get\u00a0the world's second-largest economy to redesign its trade deal with the U.S.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/china_us_trade_talks_08262019_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
