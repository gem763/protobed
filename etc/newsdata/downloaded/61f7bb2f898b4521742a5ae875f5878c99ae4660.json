Or, to put things in English... Social Security recipients will know how much of a \"raise\" they're getting next year.\n\nTwo Social Security cards lying atop a fanned pile of cash.

It was never designed to help seniors, the disabled, and other beneficiaries \"get ahead.\" Rather, COLA is tasked with helping program recipients keep up with the inflation they're facing. This inflation has been measured by the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) since 1975.\n\nWhat's particularly interesting about the CPI-W in relation to Social Security's COLA is that the SSA isn't factoring in CPI-W readings over a full-year period. Instead, only readings from the third quarter (July through September) matter, with the average CPI-W reading from the current year being compared to the average CPI-W reading from the previous year. If the average reading rises year over year in the third quarter, then beneficiaries receive a \"raise\" that's commensurate with the percentage increase (rounded to the nearest 0.1%). Meanwhile, if the average reading declines, which signals deflation, benefits remain static from one year to the next.\n\nBased on the initial data from July's BLS inflation report, Social Security recipients look to be on track for a 1.6% to 1.7% COLA. But, again, this only tells part of the story, with data from August and September still needed to fill out the puzzle.\n\nSocial Security's 2020 COLA may be higher than expected\n\nWhat is possible, though, is that external factors could provide a boost to the COLA that beneficiaries will receive next year. If you're currently receiving a monthly stipend from our nation's most successful social program, here are three events that could push Social Security's COLA higher in 2020.\n\nA satellite image showing a hurricane bearing down on Florida.

Hurricanes\n\nOne thing you may have noticed about the three months chosen for the COLA calculation is that they're smack-dab in the middle of hurricane season. Hurricanes themselves are terrible storms that we'd prefer stay out over open water and impact no one. But the fact remains that the Eastern Seaboard and Gulf of Mexico are sometimes bull's-eyes for hurricanes. And when hurricanes hit, it can adversely impact the U.S. energy industry, both onshore and offshore.", "description": "Next year's Social Security \"raise\" could very well depend on these events.", "authors": ["Sean Williams", "The Motley Fool"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0Us1PuzYYX74ot7sWz1T.A--~B/aD00NjY7dz03MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/motleyfool.com/15dbedbc3c02af7b2883105c34e08937", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
