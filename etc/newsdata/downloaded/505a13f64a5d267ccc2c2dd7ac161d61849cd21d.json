The ladies would brighten the streets in their very short skirts, dresses or shorts while the men can sometimes patrol the streets without putting on their shirts.\n\nThe native Chinese are a very hospitable and romantic folk who always display an aura of love in the air among themselves since quite often I would see couples walking hand-in-hand in the streets and thus adding some human touch to the beauty of the land.\n\nThis atmosphere of love was yet to be enhanced by the Qishi festival, which I was told is the Chinese equivalent of Valentine\u2019s Day celebrations.\n\nThe Qishi festival made China to be covered in a love smog that enhanced the romantic mood of the people in China especially those from Guangzhou.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe beauty and the romantic aura of Guangzhou is further spiced by its state of the art infrastructure whose sight can be a marvel both to the visitors and the locals who flock to the malls and other places of their choice to enjoy themselves with their spouses, family and friends.\n\n\n\nAs big as the place was, I definitely saw a lot in the same way that I missed a lot as well.\n\nWhen places have been visited, the people have been met and the business have been done it was time to wave China a good-bye and keep the wonderful memories to my heart and mind as well as to share them with the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was Guangzhou, the China I saw.\n\nThe author is a Christian, an author, media practitioner, IT administrator, entrepreneur, and an opinion leader.\n\n\n\nChina Daily website is inviting foreigner readers to share your China Story! and here are some points that we hope will help contributors.", "description": "Gliding through the Chinese airspace, higher up in the skies the plane hovers upon a gigantic and a vast piece of land that is home to over a billion people while smoothly heading towards Guangzhou, China\u2019s southern capital.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201711/23/5a16952da31040aca3db6190.jpg", "published_at": "2014-08-21"}
