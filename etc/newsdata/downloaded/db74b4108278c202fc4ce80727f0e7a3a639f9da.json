(Picture: BBC)\n\nDeath in Paradise has given fans the first glimpse of who will be replacing Ardal O\u2019Hanlon in the next series \u2013 but who could it be?\n\nProducers are keeping his identity a secret for the time being, and it\u2019s driving us crazy trying to guess who the mystery actor is.\n\nThe show posted a picture to their official Twitter account along with the caption: \u2018Greetings from the Caribbean!\n\n\u2018Here\u2019s a sneak peek of the new D.I taking over from Ardal O\u2019Hanlon to unravel the island\u2019s murder mysteries.\n\n\u2018Who do you think will be playing him? Answers on a postcard, please!\u2019\n\nArdal has decided to leave the show after three years of playing DCI (Picture: BBC/Red Planet Pictures/Denis Guyenon)\n\nThe photo shows Ardal\u2019s replacement wearing a backpack while sat on a hammock looking out to sea, and obviously he has his back to us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo far guesses have been Hugh Laurie and Ross Kemp, but we guess we will just have to wait to find out.\n\nArdal decided to step down from his role as D.I. Jack Mooney to \u2018explore other opportunities\u2019 somewhere a bit less hot.\n\nWe can\u2019t wait for the new series (Picture: BBC/Red Planet Pictures/Denis Guyenon)\n\nArdal said: \u2018I\u2019ve spent the last four summers in Guadeloupe playing DI Jack Mooney (solving over 20 murder cases in my time there!) It\u2019s been a hugely rewarding and unforgettable experience, working with incredibly talented actors, directors and crew while discovering a magical part of the world.\n\n\u2018However, it\u2019s time to move on and explore other opportunities \u2013 preferably nearer the Arctic Circle. I\u2019m confident that Death in Paradise will go from strength to strength and viewers will share my enthusiasm for Jack\u2019s successor!\u2019\n\nBut be prepared to get hit right in the feels by his exit, as executive producer Tim Key hinted: \u2018I don\u2019t think there will be a dry eye in the house.\u2019\n\nArdal will leave screens during series nine after three years of leading the squad, and viewers will need to tune in to see exactly how and why he departs.\n\nSince launching in 2011, Death in Paradise remains one of television\u2019s highest-rating dramas with series eight pulling in an average of over seven million consolidated viewers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeries 10 of Death in Paradise has already been commissioned for BBC One.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
