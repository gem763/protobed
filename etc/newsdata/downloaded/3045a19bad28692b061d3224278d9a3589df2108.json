No evidence of wrongdoing has been presented regarding any of either Biden\u2019s activities.\n\nThe matter has become so sensitive that noteworthy members of the president\u2019s Republican Party \u2014 which has largely supported even his most extreme positions on other issues \u2014 have come out against it.\n\nSen. Susan Collins called it a \u201cbig mistake.\u201d\n\n\u2018I thought the president made a big mistake by asking China to get involved in investigating a political opponent. It\u2019s completely inappropriate.\u2019 Sen. Susan Collins\n\n\u201cI thought the president made a big mistake by asking China to get involved in investigating a political opponent,\u201d the Maine Republican said. \u201cIt\u2019s completely inappropriate.\u201d\n\nCollins\u2019s fellow Maine senator, Angus King, an independent, said Wednesday that the need for Congress to probe Trump had become self-evident: \u201cWhen a sitting president admits to using the power of his office to openly solicit the engagement of a foreign government in his re-election, our system of checks and balances means that Congress has no choice but to follow the facts where they lead.\u201d\n\nOn the heels of the entreaty for Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, which had already generated political heat, Trump called on China to look into the Bidens\u2019 dealings.\n\nThis prompted comment from another Republican senator, Mitt Romney of Utah, who on Friday tweeted that Trump\u2019s \u201cunprecedented appeal to China and Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China\u2019s investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process,\u201d Romney observed in a follow-up tweet, \u201cit strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated.\u201d\n\nIn an unprecedented presidential attack on a sitting senator of one\u2019s own party, Trump tweeted, \u201cMitt Romney never knew how to win. He is a pompous \u2018ass\u2019 who has been fighting me from the beginning, except when he begged me for my endorsement for his Senate run (I gave it to him), and when he begged me to be Secretary of State (I didn\u2019t give it to him). He is so bad for R\u2019s.\u201d\n\nKey Words: \u2018Wrong and appalling\u2019: Romney on Trump urging China, Ukraine to investigate Bidens\n\nAnother Senate Republican, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, said, \u201cHold up: Americans don\u2019t look to Chinese commies for the truth.\u201d He added, \u201cIf the Biden kid broke laws by selling his name to Beijing, that\u2019s a matter for American courts, not communist tyrants running torture camps.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear precisely what Trump might believe the Bidens have done in China. Hunter Biden has worked with a bank, a lobbying group and a hedge fund, and had business dealings in China and Ukraine, including serving on the board of a Ukrainian energy company called Burisma Group.\n\n\u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens. Because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,\u201d Trump said last week.\n\n\n\nRead on: For the first time, Biden says explicitly that Trump should be impeached\n\nAlso see: From Graham to Romney to Schiff: What key players in Washington are saying about Trump\u2019s call with Ukraine\u2019s Zelensky\n\nPlus: A brief history of corporate apologies to China\n\nTanner Brown is a contributor to MarketWatch and Barron\u2019s and producer of the Caixin-Sinica Business Brief podcast.", "description": "After requesting that Ukraine look into the business dealings of former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, the president went a step further late last...", "authors": ["Tanner Brown"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT007_trump__ZG_20191009184907.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
