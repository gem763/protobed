That's all we want.\"\n\n(Image: Sky News)\n\nThe greiving parent called on American President Donald Trump as a \"man, as a father\" to ensure Mrs Sacoolas was made to take responsibility for the crash.\n\nHe added: \"I've always wanted to ask her if she could explain the moment of the crash, find out if she comforted Harry, if she spoke to Harry, find out what her movements were, did she try and call the emergency services?\n\n\"I'm just struggling because I can't imagine my lad being in the ditch and not having any comfort from anybody until the ambulance and police turn up 'X' minutes later.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: Sky News)\n\n\"When we had the funeral, which was a lovely tribute to him, I thought maybe that was the time we were going to turn the corner, but then it wasn't until a week later when we found out that she had left the country and now it feels like it has gone right back to the night he died.\n\n\"There's just no way I can start grieving yet, as a family we can't start, we need this resolved.\"\n\nMrs Charles, the teenager's mother, said she had to put her grief \"on hold\" as the story of the 42-year-old's return to the US unfolded.\n\n\"All of our grief has gone on hold, it's coming out in other horrific ways, your legs feel like lead, you're in pain morning until night that no pain killers can take away,\" she said.\n\n(Image: Sky News)\n\n(Image: Sky News)\n\n\"You're not able to cry, because we can't understand this whole situation as to why she would have left us without wanting to meet us back then.\n\n\"She needs to get on the plane and get back to the UK, just do the right thing.\n\n\"It shouldn't be that difficult, it shouldn't have been this difficult, she surely didn't have to go.\"\n\n(Image: Sky News)\n\nMrs Sacoolas' protection is now in dispute after Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab wrote to Harry's parents over the weekend, telling them the government had 'pressed strongly for a waiver of immunity, so that justice can be done.'\n\nMs Charles said before boarding her flight that she had received a letter from Mrs Sacoolas expressing her 'deepest sympathies and apologies'.\n\nMr Trump has shown little sign that he is willing for the American citizen to be tried abroad.", "description": "Tim Dunn and Charlotte Charles called for Anne Sacoolas to face justice following the death of their son near RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire", "authors": ["Milo Boyd", "Image", "Sky News", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20578702.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Harry-Dunn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
