(Future Energy Artists), an initiative that would allow Australian musicians to invest in a solar farm in south-east Queensland.\n\nLenffer was concerned about the carbon emissions generated by her group\u2019s touring schedule and what she saw as her own contribution to the climate emergency. Now, FEAT. is opening up to other sectors and individuals.\n\nAustralian musicians band together to invest in solar farms Read more\n\nWhen FEAT. was announced, Pocock responded via Instagram \u2013 \u201che was putting enthusiastic emoji responses on a lot of our posts,\u201d Lenffer says \u2013 and contacted another songwriter, Jack River, who put the two of them in touch.\n\n\u201cAs an athlete, you\u2019re in a somewhat similar position to artists in that there\u2019s no escaping what you do requires travel, and I\u2019m very conscious of my personal contribution,\u201d says Pocock, who will captain the Wallabies in their final World Cup pool game against Georgia in Japan on Friday.\n\n\u201cTo see what FEAT. was doing, and to see people like Heidi getting on with it and trying to harness that energy into actually building the future we know is coming and we all want to see, but need to speed up, that was really exciting.\u201d\n\nLenffer says that while FEAT. started and would always be identified with the musical community, she was keen for the scheme to expand and be inclusive. \u201cWe see allies in other industries as being critical to the success of what we\u2019re trying to do,\u201d she says.\n\nIt\u2019s ridiculous to think that changing lightbulbs and that sort of thing is enough. Those days are over David Pocock\n\nMoney invested in FEAT. is being used to buy ownership stakes in a solar farm called Brigalow, near the town of Pittsworth on the Darling Downs. The floor price for investment is low, just $5. The farm will power the equivalent of over 11,000 homes for 30 years.\n\nPocock presented the scheme to his teammates, trying to impress upon them the carbon footprint of a major sporting tour. \u201cIt\u2019s like any slice of the population. There are some guys who were interested in it, others didn\u2019t really see it as an issue,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI just presented the guys with what FEAT. was doing, giving them an idea of the Wallabies\u2019 emissions this year and suggesting we team with them as a way of investing an equivalent amount into renewable energy.\u201d\n\nHe convinced Foley and Haylett-Perry to come on board. \u201cThey\u2019re excited about seeing solutions to these problems that we\u2019re facing \u2026 It\u2019s ridiculous to think that changing lightbulbs and that sort of thing is enough. Those days are over. We need a big system change.\u201d\n\nPocock has been a vocal campaigner about the climate emergency, and has extended that to direct action: in 2014, he was arrested in a protest against Whitehaven Coal\u2019s Maules Creek mine in northern New South Wales.\n\nHe extended his support to the wave of school strikes started by Greta Thunberg. \u201cIf you look at social change, it very seldom just happens. It ends up taking a percentage of the population actually willing to give up their freedoms and engage in civil disobedience,\u201d he says.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest David Pocock says \u2018there\u2019s no escaping\u2019 that sport requires travel. Photograph: Jason McCawley/Getty Images\n\nHe also highlighted how global heating was already impacting on world sport, with a sharp message for rugby\u2019s governing bodies. \u201cI\u2019m not playing rugby in Australia next year, but round one of Super Rugby is in January next year,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine, in the last weekend of January, playing 80 minutes of rugby? That\u2019s the way that change is going to happen in sport, when a few players get together \u2013 and our players\u2019 unions \u2013 and say, hang on, this is an issue that\u2019s going to affect our sport.\u201d\n\nRugby World Cup group-stage deciders threatened by Super Typhoon Hagibis Read more\n\nAsked what he would say to those who tell him to \u201cstick to sport\u201d \u2013 and many have \u2013 Pocock says, \u201cfirst and foremost, we\u2019re all humans, and this is a much bigger issue than sport \u2026 It\u2019s an existential threat. Rugby is a big part of my life and I\u2019m doing absolutely everything I can to be playing at my best to be contributing to the Wallabies working towards us winning the World Cup and taking it back to Australia, that\u2019s what we\u2019re all working for.\n\n\u201cBut I really believe that sport is at its best when it\u2019s challenging society to be more inclusive, to be more forward thinking, and hopefully this is an area where sport can play more of a role, because we certainly aren\u2019t getting the leadership from our politicians.\n\n\u201cWhen young people who are too young to vote tell us their futures are on the line, you\u2019ve got to listen to them. They\u2019re not making it up, they\u2019re listening to the best of the available scientific projections. Ignoring the issue doesn\u2019t make it go away, unfortunately.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Read more about FEAT.", "description": "Exclusive: Pocock convinces Bernard Foley and Dane Haylett-Petty to join him in encouraging the sports industry to play a bigger role in sustainability", "authors": ["Andrew Stafford"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5ea502cd6f1f74058e10834e21e0212b749342b/0_285_4427_2656/master/4427.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d05777a3fcf6fb8219b894bf8ce83e32", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
