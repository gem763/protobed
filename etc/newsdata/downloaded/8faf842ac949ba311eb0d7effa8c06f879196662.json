The Montenegrin federation were ordered to play their next match, against Kosovo in June, behind closed doors.\n\nChelsea striker Tammy Abraham said on Tuesday that discussions had taken place among the England squad about what they would do in the event of racist abuse in either of the next two Euro qualifiers.\n\n\u201cYes, we\u2019ve had meetings, several meetings about it since we\u2019ve arrived,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve touched base on how to deal with the situation. Harry Kane even said that if it happens and we\u2019re not happy with it, we speak to the player and if he\u2019s not happy, we all come off the pitch together.\u201d\n\nUEFA\u2019s three-step protocol in the event of the referee or other officials becoming aware of racist abuse from supporters inside a stadium begins with an announcement over the stadium\u2019s public address system ordering the abuse to stop.\n\nIf it persists the referee will take the teams off the field for a reasonable period of time. If the abuse continues after that break, then the game is abandoned.\n\nEngland walking off before the protocol has been observed could result in them forfeiting the match, which under UEFA disciplinary regulations could see the match awarded as a 3-0 victory to Bulgaria.", "description": "Former national team goalkeeper Borislav Mikhaylov said talk of possible racist abuse on Monday was", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/15/wire-19544338-1570718619-729_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
