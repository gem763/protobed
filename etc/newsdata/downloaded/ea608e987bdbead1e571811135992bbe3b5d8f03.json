Out of character behaviours 2. Changes in appetite 3. Struggling with simple daily tasks 4. Frequent headaches or backaches 5. Always feeling guilty 6. Negative self-talk\n\nShe said another sign to look out for is out of character behaviour.\n\n'If they are thinking, feeling or behaving differently to how they would for two weeks or more that could be a significant warning sign,' she said.\n\nIf you're constantly feeling tired because you're struggling with fatigue, that's another sign something isn't right.\n\nMs Schulz suggested 'feeling like you can't get out of bed' or experiencing difficulty concentration at work because you're exhausted are indications of mental illness.\n\nOther telling signs include finding simple tasks challenging such as getting dressed, taking a shower, eating healthy foods, going for a walk or catching public transport.\n\nWhile everyone has bad days, Ms Schulz warned that if you're finding every day difficult, you should seek professional help.\n\nEarlier this month, crisis support organisation Beyond Blue created a checklist to help people identify whether they are suffering signs o depression and/or anxiety\n\nBesides emotional side-effects, mental illness can manifest physically in the form of headaches and even backaches.\n\nShe said if you're constantly feeling guilty, don't ignore the signs.\n\nMs Schulz said some people assume they are 'needy' or 'mean' so they keep their thoughts to themselves - but these feelings are actually symptomatic of a mental health condition.\n\nWhile negative self-talk is one of the biggest red flags of mental health, Ms Schulz said there are 'specific thoughts' you should look out for.\n\n'I'm worthless', 'nobody likes me', 'it's all my fault', 'people are judging me', 'I don't fit in', or 'things will never get better' are some of the 'destructive' thoughts, she said.\n\nIf you identify any of these signs, Ms Schulz said the first step is to visit your GP.\n\nEarlier this month, crisis support organisation Beyond Blue created a checklist to help people identify whether they are suffering signs o depression and/or anxiety.\n\nThe 10-question quiz helps you identify how you felt the past month and to query if you've experienced other feelings of exhaustion, nervousness or hopelessness.\n\nFor confidential support 24/7, call Beyond Blue on 1300 22 4636 24 or Lifeline Australia on 13 11 14.", "description": "Australian psychologist Tahnee Schulz has revealed the warning signs of mental health issues - including fatigue, loss in appetite and frequent headaches.", "authors": ["Cindy Tran For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/01/20109884-0-image-a-3_1571878155759.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
