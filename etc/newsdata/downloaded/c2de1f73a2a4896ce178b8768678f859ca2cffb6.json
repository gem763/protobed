Ballou High School\u2019s football team was facing rival Anacostia High. Two powerhouses vying for the Southeast Cup championship. In typical high school tradition, Ballou held a pep rally in its gymnasium ahead of the Friday evening game, marked by a performance from the cheerleading squad, an introduction of the football team and a class competition of tug of war.\n\nThree days before the Friday pep rally, freshman Steffen Brathwaite, 16, was fatally shot a few miles from the neighborhood. The celebration would go on, but on this day, in between cheering for the football team, students would take time out to mourn Steffen.\n\nAnd James.\n\nAnd Joevon.\n\nAnd Gerald. And the other Ballou students who have died in recent years.\n\nThree people under the age of 17 have been fatally shot in the District since the start of the academic year on Aug. 26. An additional 19 children have been victims of nonfatal shootings, according to data from D.C. police.\n\n\n\nAn art teacher at Ballou High said her students often use art to show their grief. \u201cThe canvas is how we express ourselves,\u201d student Na\u2019Kiya Butler, 18, said. (Na\u2019Kiya Butler/D.C. Public Schools)\n\nSome neighborhoods, like the one where Ballou sits, have seen more than their share of students who have died in violent circumstances. But kids still must go to school, and administrators and teachers must provide them with a sense of normalcy after tragedy.\n\nThe pep rally two weeks ago reflected the delicate and important role schools play in helping students cope with violence.\n\nThe rally unfolded like most \u2014 with loud, spirited cheers. A few students had made banners in art class, and the pictures and names of classmates who didn\u2019t live to see graduation were displayed in the gym.\n\nMelanie Morgan, a Ballou senior, wanted to honor Steffen, so in her second-period class, she wrote a poem about the everyday violence that claimed his life and those of other teenagers she had grown up with.\n\nWhen she read her poem aloud, Melanie said, the gym went quiet. Some students cried.\n\n\u201cIt was important, and we feel like we should remember all of our peers even though they are gone,\u201d she said.\n\n[Two friends shot dead in the neighborhood. What could he do? Keep writing music.]\n\nSo far this year, 129 people have been killed in the District, compared with 116 killed at this time in 2018. The first weeks of school followed a deadly summer in which three children were fatally shot between Memorial Day weekend and the beginning of classes.\n\nThe victims have been middle- and high-schoolers. In July, Karon Brown, 11, was fatally shot in Southeast, weeks after he graduated from fifth grade at Stanton Elementary.\n\n\u201cThe vibe now for teens is, \u2018What\u2019s my point,\u2019 \u201d said Jimmie Jenkins, a basketball coach in Southeast and a supervisor with the D.C. attorney general\u2019s \u00adanti-violence program Cure the Streets. \u201cYou have teens that are being shot that have nothing to do with these things \u2014 they\u2019re going to school, they\u2019re going to sports, and they\u2019re still getting shot. \u2018What\u2019s my point?\u2019 I feel their pain.\u201d\n\nWhen Jamel Kirkland, 17, was shot and killed last week, his former classmates at KIPP DC Somerset College Preparatory struggled. Jami Dunham, KIPP DC\u2019s deputy chief academic officer for high schools, said some parents picked up their children early because they were so distraught.\n\nSchool officials there said the mother of Jamel\u2019s close friend told administrators her grieving son would probably be unable to attend school for the week.\n\nThe impact of the violence and the death of a student doesn\u2019t stop at one school, or even one neighborhood\n\nExtra mental health counselors were also dispatched to SEED Public Charter School, where Jamel had attended classes through ninth grade.\n\n[He had \u2018goals and a vision.\u2019 Jamel Kirkland is D.C.\u2019s eighth victim age 11 to 17 to be fatally shot this year.]\n\nA leader at the D.C. military academy Jamel attended said a staff member had to take time off because he was so upset about the teen\u2019s death. His twin brother\u2019s high school and the youth recreation leagues he participated in all had people who were affected by his death.\n\nAt Somerset, staff social workers and psychologists were available, and they made special check-ins with students they knew were close to Jamel.\n\nThe grief seemed to intensify. Somerset lost another student, Maurice Scott, 15, in May, and students are still reeling from his death.\n\n\u201cMany of our students came in understandably very visibly upset,\u201d Dunham said. \u201cMany students wanted to talk and share their feelings, and others wanted time to internally process or not process in the moment and get back to school and be around friends and staff who they know care about them and feel a sense of normalcy.\u201d\n\nDonna Bonavia, an art teacher at Ballou, said that after a death, her students often use art to process the loss. The portfolios of her Advanced Placement art class last year included powerful paintings addressing the violence in the students\u2019 neighborhoods. Blood, bullets and chained fences were some of the images in the students\u2019 work.\n\nNa\u2019Kiya Butler, 18, a senior at Ballou, has used the art class to express the anxiety and depression she faces.\n\nShe said that after a student\u2019s death or violence around school, her classmates often chat and laugh in class like typical teenagers. But their art reflects a different reality.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t talk about it; the canvas is how we express ourselves,\u201d Na\u2019Kiya said. \u201cI feel people understand artwork more than when I say those feelings.\u201d\n\nNa\u2019Kiya said that whenever she returns to school after summer, anxieties about her own safety reemerge. And when a student dies, she replays the same thoughts.\n\n\u201cEvery time it happens, I think, do I know this person, have I talked to him, do I know who killed him?\u201d she said.\n\nFor Melanie and her friends, the fear of violence rarely eludes them.\n\n\u201cMy classmates, we like to be in the presence of one another because you never know the next person to go or what will happen,\u201d she said.\n\nEach time she and her friends leave one another, they always say \u201clove you\u201d and \u201cbe safe.\u201d\n\nDunham said that even though death has become a normal occurrence in many students\u2019 lives, it is still traumatizing.\n\n\u201cKids know it\u2019s not right,\u201d she said.\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Three people under the age of 17 have been fatally shot in the city since the start of the school year.", "authors": ["Perry Stein", "Reporter Covering D.C.
