On Friday, Trump feted Morrison\u2019s arrival at the White House\u2019s South Lawn with a 19-gun salute and U.S. Marine Band performances of each nation\u2019s national anthems.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s highly symbolic of where the relationship sits at the moment,\u201d said Patrick Buchan, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, noting that Morrison\u2019s state visit was second only to French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s last year.\n\n\u201cAustralia played a very smart game with Trump,\u201d he added, noting the country had avoiding directly criticizing him, unlike some European counterparts.\n\nTrump got off to a smooth start with Morrison in May, congratulating him on his surprise election victory in a tweet noting there were \u201cno greater friends\u201d than the United States and Australia.\n\nAustralia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison speaks during a news conference with U.S. President Donald Trump in the East Room of the White House in Washington, U.S., September 20, 2019.

Trump berated Turnbull in February 2017 over a bilateral refugee agreement before abruptly ending their telephone conversation.\n\nAustralia also agreed last month to join a coalition to protect oil tankers and cargo ships from threats posed by Iran in the Strait of Hormuz after a series of attacks there that Washington has blamed on Tehran.\n\nAustralia has also banned China\u2019s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd HWT.UL, the world\u2019s top provider of telecoms equipment, from its 5G network, something the Trump administration has struggled to persuade other allies to do. The United States says Huawei\u2019s ties to Beijing make the network equipment it sells to telecoms firms a security risk.\n\nAustralian intelligence concluded China was responsible for a cyberattack on Australia\u2019s parliament and its three largest political parties, Reuters reported on Monday.\n\nFollowing an arrival ceremony, bilateral meetings, and a joint news conference, Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will host a luncheon for Morrison to be followed by a state dinner at the White House.\n\nSECURITY AND TRADE\n\nDuring a visit to Sydney last month by Pompeo and U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper, the United States and Australia pledged to strengthen opposition to Chinese activities in the Pacific.\n\nChina has unnerved the region and angered the United States by installing military equipment and other facilities on artificial islands it has made in the disputed South China Sea.\n\nSlideshow (33 Images)\n\nThe United States and its Western allies also worry that China is using foreign aid to secure greater influence over small Pacific countries that control vast swath of resource-rich ocean.\n\nAustralia, traditionally the major power in the South Pacific, has promised up to A$3 billion ($2 billion) in grants and loans to counter what Washington describes as China\u2019s \u201cpayday loan diplomacy.\u201d\n\nBut Morrison has pressed Trump to end his trade war with China, which has roiled markets and hammered global growth.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump welcomed Australia's prime minister on Friday for only the second state visit of his administration, signaling the close bond between the two allies as Washington takes on Beijing and Tehran.", "authors": ["Alexandra Alper", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1432092870&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J1ZZ", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
