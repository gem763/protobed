REUTERS/Issei Kato/File Photo\n\nThe Boks have previously felt they have not always got the rub of the green from the officials in clashes with the world champions, especially in areas such as the breakdown and scrum.\n\nWith only two points separating the sides on aggregate in their last four matches, it suggests fine margins could decide the Pool B opener.\n\n\u201cHopefully the match officials will respect the game because if you look at the way things are between us and New Zealand, I think we\u2019re more balanced now,\u201d Stick told reporters on Monday.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the previous history when you look at the All Blacks, they\u2019ve been dominating. When they go to the World Cup, sometimes they become favourites. We are at an equal level at the moment.\n\n\u201cHopefully the match officials will also respect this game. Things are a lot more balanced between us and New Zealand right now.\u201d\n\nStick said there was no out-and-out favourite to lift the trophy this time, saying any of the teams at the top of the world rankings \u2014 Ireland, New Zealand, England, South Africa and Wales \u2014 could lift the Webb Ellis Cup.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the top five teams at the moment, each one of them has a good chance to win this World Cup,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the recent results, even in the northern hemisphere, where Wales beat and lost to England, it\u2019s been very close. It\u2019s been a proper build-up to this World Cup.\n\n\u201cHopefully the officials will treat every team equally, and respect the games and the fans.\u201d\n\nStick believes the Boks could not have done much more in the build-up to their tournament opener as they enter the World Cup unbeaten in 2019 and as Rugby Championship holders.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done a lot of hard work as a team and as a coaching staff. I feel that we\u2019re all aligned and I don\u2019t think we could have asked for a better build-up to the World Cup.\u201d\n\nThey also face Italy, Namibia and Canada in their pool.", "description": "South Africa's assistant coach Mzwandile Stick is hoping for a strong performance by the match officials when they take on New Zealand in their Rugby World Cup opener in Yokohama on Saturday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430451308&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F0V0-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
