Stand with Hong Kong!\u201d They sang the democracy movement\u2019s anthem, \u201cGlory to Hong Kong,\u201d as passing bus drivers and vehicle passengers leaned out of their windows to offer gestures of support. Some carried signs accusing the police of attempted murder.\n\n\u201cI think we really need foreign countries to intervene,\u201d said Chun, a 20-year-old protester. \u201cI don\u2019t know how or what they can do, but it\u2019s becoming clear we can\u2019t fight this government alone\u201d\n\nThe latest demonstration comes after thousands of young protesters rampaged across the city Tuesday, clashing with police, setting fires in government offices, and smashing the premises of businesses, organizations, and politicians with mainland Chinese connections.\n\nThe protester who was shot by police at close range has been identified as high school student Tony Tsang Chi-kin and is in hospital in stable condition. According to official figures, 25 police officers and 66 protesters were injured and 269 people arrested in the violence, which saw protesters attack the police with petrol bombs, rocks, poles, slingshots and other homemade weapons. One officer suffered third degree burns after he was attacked with corrosive liquid.\n\nPolice responded with 1,400 rounds of tear gas, hundreds of rubber bullets, water cannon, and several live rounds, but appeared unable to control the disturbances, which erupted in multiple districts across Hong Kong Island, the Kowloon peninsula and the suburban New Territories.\n\nThe government issued a statement late Tuesday condemning \u201conline orchestration of violent acts in various districts across the territory\u201d and what it called \u201cvery dangerous riots.\u201d It accused those behind the disturbances of \u201cleading Hong Kong to a chaotic and panic [sic] state.\u201d\n\nA protester holds an umbrella surrounded by tear gas as thousands of anti-China protesters clash with police in Hong Kong on October 01, 2019. | Miguel Candela Poblacion/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images More\n\nThe police also issued a statement saying \u201cPublic safety has been jeopardized and the public order of the whole city is being pushed to the verge of a very dangerous situation.\u201d\n\nAt a press conference Wednesday, Tang Ping-keung, deputy commissioner of police, defended the shooting of the young protester. \u201cThe use of force was lawful and reasonable,\u201d he said. \u201cSome say that it police who provoked the attack but this is wrong. At that time our colleagues were being chased and attacked by a large number of rioters.\u201d\n\nDemocratic lawmaker Claudia Mo told TIME that the general situation in Hong Kong was \u201cbecoming so chaotic that I don\u2019t know how we can carry on like this. Violence breeds violence. You can sense the anger and hostility and desperation of the young in particular.\u201d\n\nShe called for the resignation of the enclave\u2019s deeply unpopular top official. \u201cI personally wish Carrie Lam would just quit,\u201d Mo said. \u201cWe need a different face to lead Hong Kong. Whoever that is, there just may be a chance to restart things.\u201d\n\nConservative lawmaker Michael Tien said that it was time for Hongkongers to have the right to choose their own leader through universal suffrage. Presently, the chief executive, as the head of the administration is known, is appointed by a college of just 1,200 carefully vetted and mostly pro-Beijing electors.", "description": "\"I don't know how we can carry on like this,\" one legislator tells TIME", "authors": ["Time Staff"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aU4D5A7hDBM7dhsip2OHaQ--~B/aD0yNzMwO3c9NDA5NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/2c8d506eec0e4b6c3f7a2cd1ca70f15c", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
