Approximately six percent of those crews stayed at the Trump Turnberry,\u201d said an Air Force spokesman in an emailed statement. \u201cAs a practice, we generally send aircrews to the closest, most suitable accommodations within the government hotel rate. The review also indicated that about 75 percent of the crews stayed in the immediate vicinity of the airfield and 18 percent stayed in Glasgow.\u201d\n\nA spokesman confirmed that Turnberry stays were within the Pentagon\u2019s distance and cost limits.\n\nEarlier this week, the Air Force launched a review of its selection of lodging accommodations at the Trump Turnberry resort in Scotland, acknowledging that it \u201cmight be allowable but not advisable.\u201d\n\n[Air Force reviewing layover guidelines amid scrutiny of stop at Trump property in Scotland]\n\nThe stays result from two separate agreements that both predate Trump\u2019s presidency. Before Trump ran for president, the airport agreed to send visiting crews to Trump\u2019s course. And while President Barack Obama was still in office, the Air Force agreed to send refueling aircraft to the airport.\n\nNow that Trump is president, those two arrangements mean that the Air Force has paid the Commander in Chief to rent rooms. The Oversight Committee is investigating, but so far no evidence has emerged showing that Trump has done anything to alter the existing arrangements.\n\nTrump tweeted on Monday that the military crew stays at Turnberry have \u201cNOTHING TO DO WITH ME.\u201d Trump purchased the financially-struggling resort in 2014 and has failed to turn a profit on his investment.\n\nThe Trump Organization said it charges the visiting air crews about $100 each, and that \u2014 for about 90 percent of the year \u2014 its rates are too high for Defense Department reimbursement schedules.\n\nMissy Ryan contributed to this story.", "description": "The Air Force reviewed the travel amid heightened scrutiny of military stays at a Trump-owned property", "authors": ["Congress", "Campaigns", "Health Policy", "Pennsylvania Politics", "David A.
