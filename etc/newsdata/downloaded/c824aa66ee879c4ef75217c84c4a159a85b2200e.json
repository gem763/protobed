My parents lost everything in the corralito. I don\u2019t want it to happen to me,\u201d he said, referring to the 2001 default crisis when people were blocked from withdrawing their money.\n\nSince Fernandez\u2019s crushing victory in August primaries, which made him the favorite for the presidency, Argentine savers have withdrawn around $12 billion from their accounts.\n\nWhoever wins must reach a consensus to navigate a polarized Argentina out of the crisis.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t so much a Fernandez win as a Macri loss. It\u2019s a vote of repudiation, and in a vote of repudiation people seem to have little patience (with the resulting government),\u201d said Monica de Bolle of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\n\u201cMy take is that what we will see is a period where a lot of questions are going to be asked and we\u2019re going to see how politically able Fernandez is going to be to handle those questions,\u201d she told AFP.\n\nBeyond showing his determination to bring about change, Fernandez has given scant details of how he intends to do so.\n\nIn primaries held in August, Fernandez garnered 49.5 percent of the vote compared to only 33 percent for Macri, whose nearly four years in power have been marked by economic woes.\n\nMacri blamed Argentina\u2019s economic problems on previous Peronist governments under Kirchner (2007-15) and her late husband Nestor Kirchner (2003-07).\n\n\u2013 Safe hands \u2013\n\nThe center-right president, 60, has presented himself as a safe pair of hands and campaigned to be given the chance to follow through on his policies.\n\nHis supporters have warned of surprises pointing out there were no polls published since a massive rally in central Buenos Aires last weekend.\n\n\u201cMauricio Macri was far from perfect, but he had all the good intentions and the last thing we want is to return to the past, 12 years of Kirchnerism did not help, we are a failed country,\u201d said Tomas Villar, 23, a political science student.\n\nMacri\u2019s popularity has fallen off sharply over the last year in which Argentina has been in recession.\n\nThe poverty rate has risen to more than 35 percent, inflation for the year to September was at almost 38 percent, while the peso has depreciated 70 percent since January 2018.\n\nThat, and the austerity measures Macri subsequently was forced to announce, proved highly unpopular in a country where the spending power of many ordinary Argentines has dropped dramatically.\n\nUnder Argentine law a candidate can win the presidency in the first round if he reaches 45 percent of the vote, and a 10 point margin over his nearest rival.\n\nOtherwise a second round will be held on November 24.\n\n\u2013 No \u2018major change\u2019 \u2013\n\n\u201cPolls have been notoriously unreliable, but the ones published have not shown any major change in voter preferences since the primaries, which makes analytic sense,\u201d said Martin Kerner of analysts Eurasia.\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence that Macri has really been able to create a widespread fear of a return of Kirchnerism.\u201d\n\nSunday\u2019s election is essentially a two-way battle, with the rest of the candidates, led by former finance minister Roberto Lavagna, not expected to poll more than a combined 15 percent.\n\nVoters will also elect half of the Chamber of Deputies, a third of the Senate, the governor of Buenos Aires province and the capital\u2019s mayor.", "description": "Buenos Aires (AFP) \u2013 Voting got underway Sunday in Argentina\u2019s presidential election after a campaign dominated by the economy with", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/8a151d_supporters-alberto-fernandez-his-running-mate-cristina-kirchner-gather-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
