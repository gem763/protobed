This man trained in Boston USA at the children's medical centre and has a large list of medical experience.\n\n\"Hopefully he can start the process for a second opinion and get us refereed to doctors that can help our boy in any country.\"", "description": "Amanda and Ian Warman, from Slough, Berkshire, welcomed Ethan into the world in May last year but his life has been a fraught one", "authors": ["Tom Davidson", "Image", "Facebook", "Go Fund Me"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20726884.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Toddler-17-months-with-mystery-genetic-condition-is-still-the-same-size-as-a-newborn-but-his-organ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
