The Chinese filmmakers say that they think his group is the next big thing in music, and they want to make a biopic about the band\u2019s beginning.\n\nStan agrees and soon the band is filming its story with the help of a Chinese film company. But at nearly every turn, Stan and his band find the Chinese censors telling them what they can and can\u2019t say, especially when it comes to describing the United States as a land of freedom.\n\nVideo via Newsbusters\n\n\u201cYou got to lower your ideals of freedom if you want to suck on the warm teat of China,\u201d the American director working for the Chinese film company tells Stan and his crew.\n\nWhen Stan complains about being forced to rewrite the story the kids are trying to tell, the director takes aim at Hollywood for allowing China to censor everything without complaints.\n\n\u201cCome on, guys,\u201d the film producer says to the boys. \u201cEveryone else is fine with China approving our entertainment. Even the PC Babies don\u2019t seem to mind. And PC Babies cry about everything!\u201d\n\nEventually, Stan quits the film and goes back to the same farm he lives on that he hated so much that it goaded him to write his angry music in the first place.\n\n\u201cI want to get away from that farm. More than anything. But it\u2019s not worth living in a world where China controls my country\u2019s art,\u201d a disgruntled Stan says.\n\nThe episode sharply highlights Hollywood\u2019s meekness in the face of constant censorship that takes an ax to Hollywood\u2019s vaunted \u201cartistic integrity.\u201d\n\nA few years ago, for instance, the James Bond flick Skyfall was heavily edited to take out the Chinese bad guys for its debut in the communist nation. In another case, Hollywood stood by silent as Chinese censors took out all positive references to Taiwan in a historical epic. Last year, the communist bosses set out on a massive censorship campaign to eliminate the portrayal of fantasy elements \u2014 such as magic and demons \u2014 frim TV shows aired in China.\n\nThese instances are not isolated examples. China meddles with just about every Hollywood film it allows in Chinese theaters. They also outright ban films. A few years ago, the communist nation refused to allow productions based on WInnie the Pooh into China, and last year pop singer Justin Bieber\u2019s music was banned.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.", "description": "Wednesday night's episode of South Park\u00a0took Hollywood to task for meekly allowing China to censor its movies and TV shows in exchange for reaching that huge Asian audience and their money.", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/southparkchina1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
