The Rays will start Charlie Morton.\n\nAt 96-64, the low-budget Rays have their most wins since 2010 and can tie the team record of 97 set in 2008, when they won their only AL pennant and lost to Philadelphia in the World Series.\n\nTampa Bay began the night with a magic number of two to clinch, and Cleveland lost 8-2 at Washington while the Rays were in the eighth inning.\n\nJubilant players poured out of Tampa Bay\u2019s dugout for a celebration around the mound after right-hander Emilio Pagan retired Reese McGuire to end it.\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) - The Minnesota Twins became the record fourth team in the major leagues to win 100 games this season, beating the Kansas City Royals 6-2 Friday night behind two-run homers from Miguel San\u00f3 and Ryan LaMarre in a game shortened to 6\u00bd innings because of rain.\n\nMinnesota reached the century mark in wins for just the second time in franchise history. The 1965 Twins went 102-60, then lost the World Series to the Los Angeles Dodgers in seven games.\n\nHouston, the Los Angeles Dodgers and New York Yankees also have 100 wins. Before this year, the only seasons with as many as three 100-game winners were 1942, 1977, 1998, 2002, 2003, 2016 and 2017.\n\nSEATTLE (AP) - The Oakland Athletics wrapped up a playoff spot before the first pitch, then missed a chance to move closer to hosting next week\u2019s AL wild-card game when closer Liam Hendriks gave up two runs in the ninth inning of a 4-3 loss to the Seattle Mariners on Friday night.\n\nThe A\u2019s are tied with Tampa Bay for the two wild-card slots at 96-64 - if they wind up even, Oakland would host the Rays on Wednesday night.\n\nThe Athletics sealed their postseason berth when Cleveland lost to Washington. Many of the A\u2019s exchanged a brief set of hugs and high fives in the dugout after the Indians loss went final.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - Mets slugger Pete Alonso hit his 52nd homer of the season, tying Yankees star Aaron Judge\u2019s total from 2017 for most by a rookie.\n\nAlonso lined an 0-1 fastball from Atlanta left-hander Dallas Keuchel narrowly over the wall in left field in the first inning Friday night. He hurried around the bases after the solo homer, did handshakes with teammates outside the dugout and took a curtain call on the top step to big cheers from the crowd at Citi Field.\n\nAlonso has already set franchise records for homers, total bases (343) and extra-base hits (84). He has 119 RBIs and 100 runs, becoming the first Mets rookie to reach triple digits in both categories. No New York player had reached those totals in any season since David Wright and Carlos Beltran in 2008.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Nationals manager Dave Martinez says that three-time Cy Young Award winner Max Scherzer will start the NL wild-card game.\n\nMartinez says Stephen Strasburg and Patrick Corbin will be available in relief for Tuesday night\u2019s win-or-go-home game.\n\nWashington will face either St. Louis or Milwaukee in the wild-card game. Any of the three could end up hosting the game, depending on how the rest of the regular season goes.\n\nThe winner will face the Los Angeles Dodgers in an NL Division Series.\n\nWashington\u2019s top trio forms among the best rotation fronts in the majors.\n\nScherzer, Strasburg and Corbin all finished in the NL\u2019s top 10 in ERA, strikeouts and hits allowed per nine innings.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - Aaron Judge had the top-selling jersey in Major League Baseball for the third consecutive season.\n\nThe New York Yankees slugger beat out Bryce Harper, according to results released Friday by MLB.\n\nJudge maintained the top spot despite missing more than a third of the season. The 2017 AL Rookie of the Year entered Friday batting .272 with 26 home runs for the AL East champions.\n\nHarper set a uniform sales record for any athlete in a 24-hour window after signing a $330 million, 13-year deal with the Philadelphia Phillies in February. Since opening day, he\u2019s ranked second in sales behind Judge, followed by NL MVP contender Cody Bellinger of the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nReigning NL MVP Christian Yelich of the Milwaukee Brewers had the fifth-most popular jersey. He didn\u2019t crack the top 20 last season.\n\nBOSTON (AP) - Red Sox owners John Henry and Tom Werner intend to slash payroll to get under the luxury tax threshold next season, saying they fired Dave Dombrowski because of differing opinions on how to build for the future.\n\nThe pair made their first public comments Friday since parting with Dombrowski, the president of baseball operations, on Sept. 8. They said no matter who replaces Dombrowski, Alex Cora will return for a third season as manager.\n\nBoston has had baseball\u2019s highest payroll for two straight seasons and is on track to pay a $13 million luxury tax this year on a payroll of $243 million for purposes of the competitive balance tax, as it is formally known. That is $37 million over the tax threshold.\n\nNext year\u2019s threshold goes up to $208 million, and the Red Sox will be helped by the departure from the payroll of $56.82 million invested in five players: Rick Porcello ($20,625,000), Pablo Sandoval ($18,445,000), Mitch Moreland ($6.5 million), Steve Pearce ($6,250,000) and Eduardo N\u00fa\u00f1ez ($5 million).\n\nNFL\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) - Panthers quarterback Cam Newton says he plans on taking \u201ctime away from the game\u201d because of a mid-foot sprain that has bothered him since the third preseason game.\n\nNewton says in a 15-minute blog released Friday night that he probably shouldn\u2019t have tried to play through the injury and needs to give himself time to heal.\n\nNewton says \u201cit could very well be a week. Or two weeks. It could be three weeks, it could be four weeks, it could be six weeks. But I have to understand and know if it takes that time I trust in this team that they will, we will, still be in a great situation by the time I get back.\u201d\n\nKyle Allen has replaced Newton in the starting lineup and led Carolina to a 38-20 win over Arizona last Sunday.\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nARCADIA, Calif. (AP) - Jockey John Velazquez set a record with his 661st career graded stakes victory in the U.S. and Canada on Friday, and added his 662nd three races later.\n\nHe won the $300,000 Chandelier Stakes aboard Bast at Santa Anita, snapping a tie with fellow Hall of Famer Jerry Bailey.\n\nIt\u2019s the second career mark owned by Bailey that Velazquez has taken down. The Puerto Rico native became the all-time leading rider at Saratoga in 2013 with win No. 694 to break Bailey\u2019s mark.\n\nThe New York-based Velazquez was making a rare appearance in Southern California to ride for Hall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert.\n\nVelazquez returned later to ride Eight Rings to a six-length victory in the $300,000 American Pharoah Stakes, named for the 2015 Triple Crown winner trained by Baffert.\n\nEight Rings, the 6-5 favorite overseen by Baffert, paid $4.40 to win. The 2-year-old colt earned an automatic berth in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Juvenile race this fall at Santa Anita.\n\nEarlier, Baffert gave Velazquez a leg up on Bast, who rallied to win the Grade 1 Chandelier by a neck and earn an automatic berth in the BC Juvenile Fillies race.\n\nARCADIA, Calif. (AP) - A horse dumped its jockey and knocked down two photographers standing near the rail as racing returned to Santa Anita with the opening of its fall meet Friday amid intense scrutiny after the deaths of 31 horses at the historic track earlier in the year.\n\nIt was the lone incident between morning training hours and eight other races in the afternoon.\n\nJockey Norberto Arroyo Jr. was unseated by 2-year-old filly Leucothea in the $300,000 Chandelier Stakes. He was unhurt and rode later.\n\nThe filly veered to the outside rail and charged by the winner\u2019s circle before grazing a man and woman photographing the race near a gap in the rail. Neither apparently saw her approaching. Others jumped out of the way as Leucothea continued running most of the way around the track.\n\nAn outrider finally caught the filly near the gap leading to the stable area.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "MLB", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
