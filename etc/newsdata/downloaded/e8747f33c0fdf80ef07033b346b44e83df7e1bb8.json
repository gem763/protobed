More.\n\nWhy WeWork is having a terrible time\n\nReported by Mary Meisenzahl\n\nWeWork's original plan to go public collapsed this month after intense scrutiny and lacking investor interest threatened the company's ability to raise the $3 billion necessary to access its $6 billion credit line.\n\nSince the company publicly filed its IPO paperwork in August, WeWork's spiraling losses, corporate governance, and the behavior and business dealings of its eccentric CEO have been increasingly criticized, eventually leading it to shelve its plan to go public until at least October.\n\nTop staffers continue to pour out of the company. CEO and cofounder Adam Neumann was criticised for potential conflicts of interest after filings revealed that he owned buildings used by WeWork spaces and rented them back to the company, and also paid himself for the trademark rights to the word \"We.\"\n\nThis past month, arguably the worst in its history, has seen the company scramble to make changes in an attempt to reclaim investor interest and salvage its IPO. On Tuesday, The Wall Street Journal's Eliot Brown, Dana Cimilluca, David Benoit, and Maureen Farrell reported that Neumann would be stepping down as CEO, but remain Chairman of the We Company.\n\nTo bring you up to speed, here's everything that happened at WeWork since its publicly filed its paperwork to go public.\n\nAUGUST 14: WeWork publicly filed paperwork detailing its intent to go public.\n\nWeWork; Theo Wargo/Getty Images for iHeartMedia; S\n\nThe coworking company was last privately valued at $47 billion.

According to documents in the filing, WeWork's' parent company, The We Company:\n\nLost $429 million on $436 million in revenue in 2016.\n\nThe following year, that loss increased to $890 million as revenue grew to $886 million.\n\nIn 2018, WeWork lost $1.6 billion on $1.8 billion in revenue.\n\nFor the first six months of 2019, the firm posted a loss of $690 million on $1.5 billion in revenue.\n\nWeWork loaned millions to Neumann and other executives.\n\nThe IPO paperwork revealed that WeWork loaned CEO Adam Neumann $7 million in 2016, which he paid back in 2017.\n\nWeWork also loaned several million each to three other executives, all of which was paid back except for a $600,000 loan to Artie Minson, which was forgiven.\n\nWeWork also loaned millions to We Holdings LLC, of which Neumann is a managing member.\n\nCEO Adam Neumann cashed out $700 million from the company ahead of its IPO.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Neumann cashed out $700 million in stock options before the company's IPO, an unusual move that raised eyebrows as founders typically wait until after their startup goes public if they believe the stock's value will increase.\n\nPrevious reports confirmed that Neumann made millions through leasing his buildings in New York and San Jose to WeWork.\n\nNeumann positioned his stock in the We Company to maintain control long after the IPO.\n\nAdam Neumann, like many startup CEOs, holds shares that will give him extra votes.
