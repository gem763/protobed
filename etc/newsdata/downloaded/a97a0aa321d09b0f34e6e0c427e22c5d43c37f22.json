Vegas, baby!\n\nShortly after PEOPLE learned that Cyrus, 26, and the The Hills: New Beginnings star, 31, had ended their romantic relationship, the pop star opened the iHeartRadio Music Festival on Saturday night.\n\nThroughout her 30 minute set, Cyrus sang some of her biggest hits as well as some rock \u2018n\u2019 roll classics, without making any mention of her personal life.\n\nCommanding the stage in a strappy black top and a black pair of pants, Cyrus performed crowd favorites \u201cWe Can\u2019t Stop\u201d and \u201cWrecking Ball,\u201d as well as her breakup anthem \u201cSlide Away.\u201d\n\nCyrus also performed new track \u201cDon\u2019t Call Me Angel\u201d live for the first time, without collaborators Ariana Grande and Lana Del Rey, and covered Led Zeppelin\u2019s \u201cBlack Dog\u201d and Pink Floyd\u2019s \u201cComfortably Numb.\u201d\n\nMiley Cyrus | Kevin Mazur/Getty Images More\n\nDuring the performance, Cyrus opened up about her history with the music festival.\n\n\u201ciHeartRadio was one of the first shows I did where I really freaked people out. My microphone was a banana. People didn\u2019t like that it was a sex joke. And I came out here in an outfit because my mom was really pissed off about and I didn\u2019t know why, but then a million more moms were pissed about it too. So, then I kind of just thought she wanted the best for me,\u201d she said, referring to her 2013 performance. \u201cI love a show that celebrates every type of music, every type of person. We\u2019re all really unique. Everyone on the stage tonight is really unique. We fell in love with music in a totally different way, totally different upbringing.\u201d\n\nCyrus went on to explain that she equated music to \u201cfood and water\u201d in her household when she was a kid.\n\n\u201cYour job as a parent is to keep your kid alive, and the way that they did was by keeping us happy, and that was keeping the jukebox on 24/7,\u201d she said. \u201cWhether it was listening to Stevie Nicks or Johnny Cash, my dad thought it was really important that I had more females than males in my jukebox. And I guess that\u2019s why I\u2019m sending you right now feeling really powerful, and I hope everyone else out there feels that same amount of power. There\u2019s a lot to be done and we don\u2019t have our whole lives to do it. We have to start right now.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Brody Jenner Jokes About \u2018Holding Hands\u2019 with Liam Hemsworth After Kaitlynn Carter Kisses Miley Cyrus\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking the evening a family affair, Cyrus was joined at the event by her mother Tish Cyrus, brother Trace Cyrus and sister Brandi Cyrus, who also counts the pop star\u2019s recent ex as a pal.\n\nDuring the night out, Miley even shared a video of her and her mom dancing along to Def Leppard in the audience, as the legendary rockers dedicated hit \u201cPour Some Sugar on Me\u201d to the pop star.\n\n\u201cOn the way to school, cheerleading practice , singing lessons, dance \u2026. mama made me listen to @defleppard.
