The governor hired him anyway. I was his next victim,\u201d Washington says in the ad. She says she was \u201charassed, groped, assaulted\u201d by Anderson.\n\n\u201cWhen I was hurt, [Edwards] didn\u2019t care. John Bel says, \u2018People over politics.\u2019 Not when you\u2019re a woman like me,\u201d Washington says.\n\nThe ad was paid for by Truth in Politics, a Republican 501(c)(4) that does not have to reveal its donors. It will air statewide and online, with a total of $750,000 media buy being put to air the ad.\n\nSexual harassment complaints had been made against Anderson as early as 2006 at a previous employer. Washington said Anderson harassed her in 2016 and 2017, and Anderson left his job in November 2017 after she complained about his actions to the Edwards administration. She later reached a settlement agreement with Anderson and the state in which neither admitted wrongdoing.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

Edwards\u2019 attention, Johnny Anderson's employment was ended,\" Holl said in a statement emailed after this story was first published. \"Gov. Edwards believes Ms. Washington\u2019s allegations, and he has a zero-tolerance policy for sexual harassment. Gov. Edwards implemented state government\u2019s first uniform sexual harassment policy, championed legislation to support and empower victims of sexual harassment and assault, and has led the fights against human trafficking and domestic violence. Ms. Washington was not fired or asked to leave as a result of making her allegations. She submitted her letter of resignation weeks before her allegations were made. The governor\u2019s administration has treated her with dignity and respect throughout this process.\u201d\n\nIn the final weeks before the election, Republicans have ramped up their criticism of Edwards over Anderson. On Thursday, the Republican Governors Association\u2019s affiliate, RGA Right Direction PAC, released a television ad that similarly attacked Edwards over his handling of Anderson's employment.\n\nMost polling of the Oct. 12 primary has shown Edwards leading his two Republican competitors \u2014 Rep. Ralph Abraham and self-funding businessman Eddie Rispone \u2014 with Edwards just shy of the majority of the vote needed to clinch reelection without a runoff. If Edwards falls short of a majority of the votes cast, he will face the second-place candidate in another election on Nov. 16.\n\nIn recent days, Republicans have pushed hard to keep Edwards below 50 percent. President Donald Trump tweeted twice about the race this week, pleading with his Louisiana followers to vote for either Abraham or Rispone. \"A Republican will win if you can force a runoff!\" he posted.\n\nMeanwhile, Vice President Mike Pence is reportedly planning a trip to the state this weekend.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/dd/ba/5e41b065452f8bfbf81f6b664529/191003-john-bel-edwards-getty-773.jpg"}
