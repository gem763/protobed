The Straits Times\n\nOnce the top university in Asia, the National University of Singapore (NUS) is now in third place after being beaten for the second year running by Tsinghua university in this year\u2019s Times Higher Education 2020 ranking.\n\nWhile it came in second last year, it was ousted from its spot this year by another Chinese university: Peking.\n\nThe ranking, published on Thursday (Sept 12), rated some 1,400 universities on factors like learning environment, research reputation, citations, and the international outlook of students and staff.\n\nNUS \u2013 which once occupied the top spot in Asia between 2014 to 2017 \u2013 came in 25th globally, a drop of two spots from last year.\n\nMeanwhile, Nanyang Technological University (NTU) came in 48th \u2013 a rise of three places.\n\nIt ranked seventh among Asian universities, after the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, the University of Tokyo, and University of Hong Kong.\n\nAccording to the ranking, the top five universities worldwide were Oxford, the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), Cambridge, Stanford, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).\n\nTimes Higher Education chief knowledge officer Phil Baty reportedly told The Straits Times (ST) that the differences between Tsinghua, Beijing and NUS were \u201cvery slight\u201d, and that the NUS\u2019 performance had not in fact diminished.\n\n\u201cIt is simply the case that China\u2019s top two universities continue to make extraordinary gains, fuelled by decades of reform and investment, huge increases in research productivity, but more recently also in research quality and some important international collaborations,\u201d ST quoted him as saying.\n\nST\u2019s report also quoted Times Higher Education rankings editor Ellie Bothwell as saying that Singapore was \u201cnot immune to the rise of China\u201d.\n\nAs for NTU, its president Subra Suresh said the university was \u201cpleased with its rapidly growing reputation\u201d and was working on nurturing new discoveries, deepening research expertise in energy, food security, cybersecurity and climate change, and teaching students 21st century skills.\n\nAmong the top 25 universities, NUS had the second highest ratio of staff to students \u2013 1:17.9 \u2013 beaten only by the University of Toronto (1:20.1), which ranked 18th.\n\nNTU\u2019s ratio was 1:15.9.\n\nInternational students comprised 30 per cent of NUS\u2019 population, and 27 per cent of NTU\u2019s, the ranking found.\n\nIn comparison, international students formed 56 per cent and 52 per cent of the student body at Imperial College London (10th place) and University College London (15th place) respectively \u2013 among the highest figures across universities in the top 100.\n\nOxford (1st place) had a student body comprising 41 per cent international students.\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - Sorry, NUS - there's a new king in town..
