I\u2019m a fucking idiot. I can\u2019t kill shit,\u201d he tells his imagined viewers in English as he drives away.\n\nInside the synagogue, worshippers have watched the attacker\u2019s attempts to penetrate the building on the security cameras.\n\n\u201cWe barricaded our doors from inside and waited for the police,\u201d Jewish community leader Max Privorotzki told Stuttgarter Zeitung.\n\n\u201cIn between, we carried on with our service.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Really calm, like a professional\u2019-\n\nA few streets away, the gunman spots a kebab shop and pulls up, grabbing his cobbled-together arsenal.\n\n\u201cDoener. That\u2019ll do,\u201d he says under his breath.\n\nHe tosses one of the bombs inside, firing a final burst with the automatic before it jams for good.\n\nBut his arrival is enough to scare patrons and the owner, and several men flee from the plush red-upholstered benches into the depths of the store.\n\n\u201cHe was really calm, like a professional. Perhaps he\u2019s done something like this several times,\u201d proprietor Rifat Tekin, who escaped by ducking behind the salad counter, later told broadcaster NTV.\n\nFrom the shooter\u2019s perspective, there is more wrestling with weapons and cursing as he attempts to harm the men cowering at the back of the shop, who are pleading for their lives.\n\nCartridges rattle onto the floor from his seemingly inept fingers.\n\nAfter briefly stepping outside and scaring pedestrians, he returns to the shop where he executes one of the men at point-blank range with two shotgun blasts, cutting off his cry of \u201cNo!\u201d.\n\n\u201cAt least I\u2019ve demonstrated how useless improvised weapons are,\u201d he mutters to himself and the camera on his way out, a lone bottle of cola somehow still standing on one table, another toppled next to an abandoned meal and a pair of glasses at the next.\n\nThe police cut off his first attempt at escape in the car, and he exchanges fire with them before falling to the ground for several seconds, struck by a bullet as he attempted to drive off.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m bleeding, I\u2019ve been shot in the neck,\u201d he says once he is underway again, groaning with pain and grimacing in the moments his face is visible.\n\nHe turns the car radio on over hectic, cartoonish music from his bluetooth speaker, but the presenters are discussing the US-China trade war rather than his failed onslaught.\n\n\u201cSorry guys, that was it. A total loser\u2026\u201d the killer says, before tossing the still-broadcasting smartphone out of the window.", "description": "Frankfurt am Main (AFP) \u2013 After minutes of stillness punctuated by clicks and muttering, the camera pitches up and shows the close-shaved, youthful", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/39e7a3_video-grab-gunman-shot-video-halle-gunman-fumbling-furious-assault-caught-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
