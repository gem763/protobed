The White House letter is only the latest attempt to cover up his betrayal of our democracy, and to insist that the President is above the law.\u201d\n\n.@realDonaldTrump, you are not above the law. You will be held accountable. #TruthExposed https://t.co/elMCHdLYlK \u2014 Nancy Pelosi (@SpeakerPelosi) October 9, 2019\n\nHer response came just hours after White House counsel Pat Cipollone sent Pelosi and other top Democrats an eight-page letter accusing them of waging a \u201cpartisan and unconstitutional\u201d effort to overturn the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump and his Administration reject your baseless, unconstitutional efforts to overturn the democratic process. Your unprecedented actions have left the President with no choice,\u201d read the letter addressed to Pelosi, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) and House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.). \u201cIn order to fulfill his duties to the American people, the Constitution, the Executive Branch, and all future occupants of the Office of the Presidency, President Trump and his Administration cannot participate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances.\u201d\n\nTrump and his team have been embroiled in scandal following the whistleblower complaint, which discussed a July phone call in which the president repeatedly pressured Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate one of his main political rivals, former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son Hunter Biden. The July call came shortly after Trump ordered his administration to withhold millions of dollars in military funding for Ukraine. Democrats have cast the discussion as a clear demand for a political favor in exchange for that military funding.\n\nTrump has vehemently rejected that characterization, although text messages sent by U.S. officials \u2015 and released by Democrats last week \u2015 appeared to echo the whistleblower complaint and detail concerns within the president\u2019s own administration after the call with Zelensky.\n\nThe House has already issued multiple subpoenas as part of its investigations, targeting high-profile officials including Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani. The White House itself has also been subpoenaed for Ukraine-related documents.\n\nIn her statement on Tuesday, Pelosi rejected the White House\u2019s claims that the impeachment inquiry was out of bounds, calling those claims \u201cmanifestly wrong\u201d and accusing Trump of \u201csimply another unlawful attempt to hide the facts of the Trump Administration\u2019s brazen efforts to pressure foreign powers to intervene in the 2020 elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite the White House\u2019s stonewalling, we see a growing body of evidence that shows that President Trump abused his office and violated his oath to \u2018protect, preserve and defend the Constitution,\u2019\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cThe White House should be warned that continued efforts to hide the truth of the President\u2019s abuse of power from the American people will be regarded as further evidence of obstruction.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. President, you are not above the law,\u201d the speaker continued. \u201cYou will be held accountable.\u201d\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nWitness In Trump-Ukraine Scandal Ordered Not To Appear Before Congress\n\nMore Details Emerge About How White House Officials Reacted To Trump's Call With Ukraine\n\nWhite House Refuses To Cooperate With Impeachment Inquiry; Constitutional Crisis Looms\n\nLove HuffPost?
