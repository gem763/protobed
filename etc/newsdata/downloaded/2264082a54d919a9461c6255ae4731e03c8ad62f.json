No. We must have the Labour Party this week saying no to Brexit and we must lead the campaign to remain.\"\n\nSpeaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show, Mr Corbyn acknowledged that most Labour supporters backed staying in the EU.\n\nBut he said the party needed to show more understanding of why the country voted leave and even if the UK were to remain in the EU, there needed to be serious reform.\n\nMr McCluskey, a key ally of Mr Corbyn, appealed for loyalty on the issue, saying the party must go into the looming general election \"united\".\n\n\"When we have a policy on Brexit and Jeremy Corbyn makes it clear that that is the policy, then that's what leading members of the shadow cabinet should argue for,\" he told Sky News.\n\n\"If they find they can't argue for it because they feel strongly, well, of course they have that right but they should step aside from the shadow cabinet\u2026and they can argue whatever they want.\"", "description": "The Labour leader is coming under pressure to signal his opposition to leaving the EU \"once and for all\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9C72/production/_108905004_mediaitem108905003.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
