Matter of fact, it was a perfect landing,\" said Chuck McElwee, the flight school's owner.\n\nHe praised both the student pilot and the tower saying: \"I'm telling you, you don't get that cooperation very often.\"", "description": "Air traffic operators helped coach the Australian man to land on the runway during his flying lesson.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3C1B/production/_108578351_gettyimages-973363256.jpg"}
