If the respondent views the removal as prejudicial, they may enrol the matter to seek an order in respect of the removal\u201d.\n\nIn terms of Rule 41 of the court, the applicant \u201cmay at any time before the matter has been set down and thereafter by consent of the parties or leave of the court withdraw such proceedings\u201d.\n\nThe other parties may apply to court for an order for costs.\n\nIn August, a desperate Mvithi took his case to the Constitutional Court but his application fell through.\n\nWithout income since 2012 and unable to afford lawyers, he filed the papers on his own before the apex court, which ruled that \u201cthe applicant has not placed before the court exceptional circumstances for direct access\u201d.\n\nThe judges suggested that Mvithi should consider the lower courts, where for two years Mapisa-Nqakula, claiming she intended to lodge a court review, had refused to implement the Public Protector\u2019s remedial action that Mvithi should return to work.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, if he is so minded, the applicant may approach another court that has jurisdiction to entertain the matter as a court of first instance,\u201d read the order dated August 14 that was only sent to Mvithi on September 10 by the court registrar, Kgwadi Makgakga.\n\nAlthough Makgakga said the court \u201cwill not engage in any further correspondence regarding this matter,\u201d Mvithi wrote later to Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng\u2019s complaints desk, including the update that the high court hearing scheduled for September 9 was removed from the roll at the minister\u2019s behest and without his consent.\n\nIn one of his correspondences, he recounted how he can\u2019t even afford sanitary towels for his teenage daughters\n\nIn February, Mkhwebane named and shamed Mapisa-Nqakula as being among those who defied her remedial action, mentioning specifically Mvithi\u2019s case, which she concluded in July 2017.\n\nShe said Mvithi and his family were without a source of income due to maladministration by the defence department and \u201cnow and again, Mvithi writes to me, complaining that my office is doing nothing about this plight when in fact we have done all that we could\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn one of his correspondences, he recounted how he can\u2019t even afford sanitary towels for his teenage daughters as a result of what he sees as a failure to assist from my office,\u201d Mkhwebane said then.\n\nMkhwebane, who also had powers to lodge a contempt application against members of the executive and officials who disregard her reports, had previously threatened to report Mapisa-Nqakula to the Speaker of the National Assembly.\n\nIn another twist, Mvithi received summons dated September 9 to appear before a senior military judge on September 30 \u201cconcerning common law assault, intimidation and [other charges] preferred against you\u201d.\n\nThis despite the fact that he was fired seven years ago, and military courts generally do not prosecute civilians.\n\n\u201cYou are required to attend as heretofore commanded and to remain in attendance until the conclusion of the proceedings unless the military judge sooner excuses you. Failure to comply with the commands and requirements of this summons will render you liable to a fine or imprisonment for a period not exceeding one month,\u201d read the letter signed by a Colonel T Dengwa.\n\nMvithi told City Press last week that no military judge was prepared to preside over the case.\n\nHe said a senior military judge passed the matter to a junior judge, who also refused to preside because he was of a junior rank to Mvithi and that was not allowed in terms of the Military Disciplinary Measures Act.\n\nSouth African National Defence Union\u2019s Pikkie Greeff said: \u201cMilitary courts only have jurisdiction over persons who are subject to the military discipline code.\u201d\n\nIf Mvithi was indeed discharged in 2012, then the military court does not have jurisdiction, Greeff said.\n\nMvithi said his \u201cquest for swift justice has been hell for my family, my sickly elderly mother, only left to survive on the pension grants of equally sickly elderly mother-in-law\u201d.\n\nHe said his children have not been getting their school reports due to unpaid fees and his 14-year-old daughter \u201cis already showing signs of depression\u201d.\n\n\u201cThese are just a few of the day-to-day hardships and misery that my family is going through with. I cannot afford swift equitable justice which on its own is prohibitively expensive\u201d.\n\nDefence spokesperson Siphiwe Dlamini said \u201cthe matter is sub judice.\u201d", "description": "Instead of making good on a two year long promise to take on review the Public Protector\u2019s report that an unlawfully dismissed army commander be reinstated, Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula backtracked last month.", "authors": ["Setumo Stone"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9379/445a09121add42f3809064247c3da830.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
