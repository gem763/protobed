Under U.K. law, two-thirds of MPs would need to back a snap election for one to take place.\n\nThe vote comes the day after Johnson's government suffered a heavy defeat as MPs backed a plan to seize control of the parliamentary timetable \u2014 something usually controlled by the government \u2014 in order to enable them to block a no-deal Brexit. The prime minister will now push for a general election in the hope of winning a majority and regaining control of the Brexit process.\n\nThe bill, which if passed by the House of Lords will force Johnson to request a Brexit extension to January 31 next year, was backed in the Commons with a majority of 28.\n\nBut before it was passed, an amendment was added in a moment of bizarre House of Commons procedure, which would allow MPs a vote on a tweaked version of the deal clinched by Theresa May. The amendment passed because there were no tellers \u2014 MPs appointed to count the votes.\n\nThe amendment, laid by Labour MP Stephen Kinnock and backed by 17 of his colleagues, would make passing the tweaked May deal government policy. That deal, which included a Commons vote on a second EU referendum, was hammered out after days of talks with the opposition Labour party but the former prime minister was forced to resign before it could be put to a vote.\n\nAfter the bill passed its final Commons stage, Johnson implored MPs to back his motion for a general election, insisting he would never ask Brussels for a Brexit delay.\n\n\u201cThe country must now decide whether the Leader of the Opposition [Jeremy Corbyn] or I goes to the negotiations in Brussels on October 17 to sort this out,\" he said. \"Everybody will know that if the right honorable gentleman were to go there \u2026 he would beg for an extension, he would accept whatever Brussels demands. And then we would have years more dither and delay, yet more arguments over Brexit and no resolution to the uncertainty that currently bedevils this country and our economy.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI don\u2019t want an election, the public don\u2019t want an election, the country doesn\u2019t want an election but this house has left no other option for letting the public decide who they want as prime minister.\u201d\n\nBut Corbyn shot back: \u201cThe offer of an election today is a bit like the offer of an apple to Snow White from the Wicked Queen. What he is offering is not an apple of the election but the poison of a no-deal. Let this bill pass, and gain royal assent, then we will back an election so we do not crash out with a no-deal exit from the European Union.\u201d\n\nOne MP said Labour was split over when it should back an election. Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer is said to favor holding one after the October 31 Brexit date, while Corbyn is said to favor a public poll as soon as the bill forcing a Brexit delay is passed.\n\nThe bill will be debated in the House of Lords on Thursday and must be completed on Monday at the latest to avoid being scuppered by the impending suspension of parliament. Peers launched into a marathon debate on Wednesday over whether to impose a time limit on its assessment of the Brexit delay bill.\n\nTory peers tabled dozens of amendments in a bid to filibuster the discussion, with the House expected to sit until the early hours of the morning. A Labour official in the Lords said: \u201cI left the house this morning with a change of clothes and toiletries and everything.\u201d\n\nThey insisted the government was \u201ccomplicit\u201d in the filibustering of the debate, but a Downing Street spokesman said what happened in the Lords was a question for the Lords.\n\nAt a meeting of Conservative parliamentarians, one pro-Brexit MP, Daniel Kawczynski, told Johnson he should guarantee that the whip will never be restored to 21 Tory rebels who voted against their own government to allow time for the delay bill. On Wednesday night they were banned from standing as Tory candidates at the next election.\n\nBut Kawczynski said he was shouted down by colleagues, who demanded the whip be restored to the rebels. A Downing Street source insisted MPs had been warned of the consequences before the vote on Tuesday. But they said other Tories who voted against the government on the actual bill stages would not lose the whip. In the end, Tory MP Caroline Spelman was the only extra rebel.\n\nEarlier, Chancellor Sajid Javid was accused of laying out a \u201cgrubby electioneering stunt\u201d by his Labour counterpart John McDonnell as he announced a one-year spending review full of promises designed to put pressure on the opposition.\n\nIn another sign that Johnson's government is gearing up for an election, Javid declared the \u201cend of austerity\u201d as he revealed that no government department will be cut in 2020-2021, announcing an overall increase in spending of \u00a313.8 billion compared to the current year.", "description": "The bill would push the Brexit deadline to January 31 next year.", "authors": ["Emilio Casalicchio", "Lili Bayer"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1165952367-1200x628.jpg"}
