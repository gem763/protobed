He can even recite, without hesitation, some future NFL coaches who graduated from Eastern Illinois: Mike Shanahan, Sean Payton, Brad Childress and the late Mike Heimerdinger.\n\nBut as the 32-year-old Wommack reminisced about his tenure in Charleston, Illinois, he\u2019s also enjoyed spending the week talking smack with some old coaching friends.\n\n\u201cKind of neat to go do that,\u201d Wommack said as the Hoosiers prepared for Saturday\u2019s home opener. \u201cStarting to text back with some of the guys, still got a group text going with some of those EIU guys and the trash talking has already begun so I\u2019ll have to have my game ready for them.\u201d\n\nHe is more concerned with getting the Hoosiers defense righted after 25 missing tackles in last week\u2019s season-opening victory over Ball State, especially before No. 5 Ohio State comes to town next week.\n\nThat is where the danger lurks this week - overlooking the smaller school sandwiched between those two games.\n\nIndiana\u2019s record is littered with reminders of the possibilities. Since 2005, the Hoosiers have endured losses to Bowling Green, North Texas, Central Michigan, Southern Illinois and three times to Ball State. Coach Tom Allen can cite other examples throughout the college football landscape too: Appalachian State won at Michigan in 2007, Ohio won at Penn State and just last week Tennessee lost at home to Georgia State.\n\nLately, though, it seems the Hoosiers (1-0) have gotten the message. They\u2019ve won 15 of their last 16 non-conference games .\n\nThis week, Eastern Illinois (0-1) has its own insider - first-year coach Adam Cushing, who\u2019s been taking notes on the Hoosiers ever since he joined Pat Fitzgerald\u2019s staff at Northwestern in 2004.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the first time that a lot of the guys on staff myself included, have dealt with this scheme,\u201d Cushing said. \u201cI\u2019ve got some old notes but it\u2019s like anything they\u2019re going to do (are) things that fit the skill set of the guys they have. So I think it\u2019s going to help us have a baseline for game-planning.\u201d\n\nWommack, meanwhile, understands the program, the ability to get his team focused and to see enough improvement to win bragging rights.\n\n\u201cFor our guys, it really doesn\u2019t matter, especially early in the season, who you\u2019re playing and who you\u2019re going up against,\u201d Wommack said. \u201cIt\u2019s about improving yourself and getting better every day, which is what I think we\u2019re really excited to get moving forward on.\u201d\n\nDUAL THREAT\n\nFor the second straight week, Cushing has not announced his starting quarterback. Instead, he\u2019ll let senior Jonathan Brantley and redshirt junior Harry Woodberry duel in practice. Last week, Brantley started and went 13 of 25 with 103 yards and one touchdown while Woodberry was 13 of 22 with 121 yards and one interception in a 24-10 loss to Chattanooga.\n\n\u201cThis competition is not over and I\u2019ve been continuing to say that the competition is not over,\u201d Cushing said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be week to week. So the guy that goes out and does the best is probably going to get the nod. This is our plan.\u201d\n\nTHE ENCORE\n\nIndiana quarterback Michael Penix Jr. was named the Big Ten\u2019s freshman of the week after throwing for 326 yards and one touchdown and running for 67 yards in his starting debut. This week, Allen and the Hoosiers expect to see more consistency from the redshirt freshman.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of errors that we had, mainly ball security,\u201d Penix said. \u201cCoach stressed that a lot. We didn\u2019t have any fumbles, we had turnovers. But ball security he stressed and a lot of small errors most people wouldn\u2019t notice.\u201d\n\nBIG CHALLENGE\n\nWhile this will be the first meeting between the schools, and Eastern Illinois is familiar with Big Ten play. They are 0-8 all-time against the conference with their most recent loss coming in 2015 to Northwestern. Indiana is 2-0 all-time against the Ohio Valley Conference, with victories over Eastern Kentucky and Murray State.\n\nHOLIDAY ROAD\n\nThe Hoosiers will welcome back players from the 1979 team for the 40th anniversary of their Holiday Bowl victory - the first postseason win in school history. ESPN analyst Lee Corso coached the team, which was led by quarterback Tim Clifford.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Indiana defensive coordinator Kane Wommack knows all about Eastern Illinois football.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Michael Marot"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/08/31/indiana_ball_st_football_22277_c0-118-2814-1758_s1770x1032.jpg?726ffb50cf34401b768b2f62da2bdef97cbc891c", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
