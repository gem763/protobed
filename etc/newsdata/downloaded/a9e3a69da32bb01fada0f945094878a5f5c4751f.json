The TPUSA founder spoke with host Matthew Boyle on SiriusXM\u2019s Breitbart News Sunday.\n\n\u201cSenator Harris signs this letter comparing [TPUSA] to the most hateful things you could possibly imagine,\u201d said Kirk of the senator signing a University of Nevada, Reno (UNR) petition, which he says has waged \u201cslanderous accusations\u201d against his conservative organization.\n\n\u201cWe completely and wholeheartedly reject this accusation by Senator Harris,\u201d affirmed Kirk. \u201cWe demand a total and unequivocal apology and retraction.\u201d\n\nListen below:\n\n\u201cShe signs this [petition] to try to pander to these radicals on campus,\u201d said Kirk. \u201c[Harris] is supposed to be this leading candidate for the Democrat Party \u2014 obviously, that hasn\u2019t materialized too well for her, but \u2014 you have these politicians that validate the radical narrative on these college campuses, time and time again.\u201d\n\nThe TPUSA founder also invited Sen. Harris to meet and spend time with his student members, so that she may be enlightened on what his organization actually stands for. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t she stop by our Black Leadership Summit?\u201d asked Kirk.\n\n\u201cWe have the largest-ever Young Women\u2019s Leadership Summit, the largest-ever Teenage Student Action Summit, largest Latino Summit, largest Black Leadership Summit,\u201d elaborated Kirk. \u201cSo out of all the organizations to single-out and attack, it is the most unfair, and honestly, the most laughable, to go after Turning Point USA.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so baseless, it\u2019s so slanderous, but look, the left doesn\u2019t care about facts,\u201d said Kirk. \u201cAll they care about is attacking people that they might deem a threat, and do whatever they possibly can to get themselves into current political power.\u201d\n\nOn the topic of leftists doing whatever it takes to be in political power, Kirk also offered his remarks regarding the Democrats\u2019 latest attacks on President Donald Trump. Kirk said.\n\nThe reason they are trying to impeach this duly-elected, successful president is because they see what you and I see, and what any other objective viewer sees. They see crowds with 40,000 people in stadiums, if you count the overflow. They see the president all across the country \u2014 in every corner of the country \u2014 being able to draw people that wait in line for 40 to 60 to 80 hours \u2014 they see a campaign that has raised twice as much money than Barack Obama\u2019s successful 2012 reelection campaign. So they see all these things, and they see their corrupt, boring, weak candidates that are running for the presidency, and they get very, very worried, and very nervous. Because currently, we have the best economy \u2014 the world is more peaceful because of the benevolency of the superpower of America that has been restored by the President of the United States rebuilding our military and asserting us against our enemies, such as Iran, and reapplying sanctions against them.\n\n\u201cSo they can\u2019t run on policy, they can\u2019t run on ideas,\u201d said Kirk. \u201cThey are terrified that the president\u2019s base is actually growing, that black approval ratings are going up, and Hispanic approval ratings are going up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Democrats are not trying to remove the President of the United States because he did something wrong, they\u2019re trying to remove him because he got in the way of their agenda,\u201d said Kirk.\n\nThe TPUSA founder added that when the left targets conservatives in this type of manner, it just \u201cgoes to show that you\u2019re making a difference \u2014 that\u2019s how you know that you\u2019re moving the dial.\u201d\n\n\u201cI spoke at the University of Nevada, Reno earlier this week to a crowd that was double the size of what [Harris] drew on the very same campus two weeks ago,\u201d noted Kirk. \u201cSo maybe she\u2019s a little bit upset that Turning Point USA, a national conservative student organization, is drawing twice as many people on a campus that\u2019s supposed to be very, very liberal.\u201d\n\nYou can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo and on Instagram.", "description": "Kirk called on Sen.
