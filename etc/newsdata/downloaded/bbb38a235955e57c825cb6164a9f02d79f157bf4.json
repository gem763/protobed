Rome is known as one of the greenest cities in Europe, with its 313,000 trees filling its many parks and lining the streets in the city center.\n\nHowever, many were planted nearly a century ago and are now weak or dying. Seeing how they were neglected made Gandini want to act.\n\n\u201cI had been sculpting wood since I was a kid, in my garage. Then I chose to carve a stump that was out on the street. That is how I chose to start carving stumps in Rome,\u201d he said, as he worked on his latest creation.\n\nHe said he liked to meet people while working and had no personal claim to the faces, animals and other artwork carved out the stumps.\n\n\u201cIt takes me about a week to finish one sculpture, then it becomes everyone\u2019s. It\u2019s a passion and a bit of a fixation,\u201d he added, as passers-by stopped to admire his work and take photos with their phones.\n\nGandini maps the stumps on his website, and the sculptures are becoming a tourist attraction. Tour guides even include his work in their packages.\n\n\u201cStumps are not very well considered but they have the right features that make them perfect for carving,\u201d he said. \u201cRome has many stumps that are waiting to become pieces of art.\u201d\n\nDespite the popularity of his work among locals and tourists, the Rome authorities have been less enthusiastic.\n\nAlthough there is no law that forbids people from carving dead tree stumps, police have threatened to ban him from historic areas using tough new rules drawn up in recent years to maintain decorum.\n\nSlideshow (7 Images)\n\nGandini says he loves nature and it hurts him to see the trees become a safety hazard.\n\nThey often fall and smash cars during storms, and city hall says some 86,000 need to be specially maintained or chopped down.\n\n\u201cIf nothing changes in ten years there will be hardly any trees left,\u201d Gandini said.", "description": "Andrea Gandini, a 22-year-old Roman sculptor, is making a growing name for himself by turning the Eternal City's dead tree stumps into much-admired pieces of art.", "authors": ["Andrea Ciociola", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442640580&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I08V", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
