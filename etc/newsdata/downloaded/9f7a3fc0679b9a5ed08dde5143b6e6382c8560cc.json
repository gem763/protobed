(Qilai Shen/Bloomberg)\n\nAs new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods took effect this week, China filed a case with the World Trade Organization alleging unfair trade practices.\n\nSome commentators continue to label the escalating bilateral trade war a \u201close-lose\u201d conflict. For example, NBC commentator Ali Velshi recently declared, \u201cThis is the worst kind of trade war because it\u2019s lose-lose for everybody, right? The U.S. is losing. \u2026 China is losing \u2013 and they\u2019re probably hurting more than we are in the United States.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s little doubt that the U.S.-China trade war is taking its toll. As the world\u2019s two most powerful economies desperately try to out-tariff each other, fears of a global recession are intensifying.\n\nContinuing this feud hurts both sides \u2013 so one might think there\u2019s an incentive to compromise. Yet while the U.S.-China trade war is a \u201close-lose\u201d economically, that may not be the case politically.\n\n[For Trump, it was a summer of tariffs and more tariffs. Here\u2019s where things stand.]\n\nPolitical science literature suggests a number of reasons the Chinese leadership, in particular, could actually benefit from a protracted trade war. Three reasons stand out \u2013 and explain why Beijing might not back down to Washington\u2019s demands anytime soon:\n\n1. The trade war gives China a clear enemy\n\nExtensive research on \u201cdiversionary politics\u201d hypothesizes that there\u2019s nothing that political leaders value more than an external villain. Especially for an authoritarian regime, an enemy deflects attention from problems at home, gives citizens a target to rally against, and galvanizes nationalistic fervor. For China, the Trump administration is the perfect foil: brash, unapologetic and politically vulnerable.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping hasn\u2019t hesitated to criticize the Trump administration and to leverage the trade war to strengthen his power. As Trump has clumsily argued that tariffs are costless for U.S. consumers, Xi has implied that winning will require heroic sacrifices from Chinese citizens all banding together.\n\nAmid rising economic tensions with the United States, Xi has even drawn an analogy that goes to the heart of the Chinese Communist Party. He has urged citizens to prepare for a new \u201cLong March,\u201d referencing the legendary 4,000-mile trek that Communist forces took in 1934-1935. After much hardship, the Red Army remobilized to seize power in China in 1949.\n\nThe Chinese leadership wants to win the trade war but, even more, it needs to thwart challenges to its legitimacy. Pro-democracy protests raging in Hong Kong also bring the possibility of similar troubles on the mainland, so Xi probably feels added pressure to convince the Chinese people that he\u2019s on their side. Having a clear antagonist like Trump makes that easier.\n\n2. There\u2019s an opportunity for China to sow divisions in the West\n\nScholarship frequently examines how rising powers like China challenge the geopolitics of a unipolar world dominated by the United States. Just as Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. elections to sow discord and to flex its muscles, fraying U.S. alliances and political mayhem in Washington can clear the brush for China\u2019s ascent.\n\nConventional wisdom holds that China is playing a waiting game in the trade war. Here\u2019s the thinking: Xi is betting on a Democrat to win the White House in 2020, and he\u2019ll seize the opportunity to broker a more favorable deal. Yet an alternative theory is that China is deliberately exploiting the trade war to upset business-as-usual in American politics and to wreak havoc on U.S. foreign policy.\n\n[A more assertive Beijing raises new questions for U.S.-China relations]\n\nAnthony Scaramucci, the former White House aide who became a Trump critic, has made exactly this point. \u201cThe Chinese leadership could actually want @realDonaldTrump to stay in power,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cThey think long term. Imagine another 5 years of him completely destabilizing the Western Alliance and annihilating the global trading system.\u201d\n\nMost analysts agree that China has its sights set on rivaling (or even eclipsing) the United States as a global superpower within decades. Political discord among Western leaders and the inability of the U.S. government to tackle big challenges \u2013 including keeping its economy afloat \u2013 can help China achieve its goals more quickly.\n\n3. And China\u2019s leadership can send a clear message\n\nA large body of literature on \u201csignaling theory\u201d examines how political leaders credibly commit to taking tough courses of action. This directly speaks to the how countries form reputations for determination. While some scholars suggest that national reputations can\u2019t be won through fighting, seminal research on deterrence insists that proving a willingness to inflict pain on the enemy is what matters most.\n\nTo the extent that nations can craft a reputation for resolve, the trade war presents Xi with a rare and unusually high-profile opportunity to send a loud and clear signal that China won\u2019t be tossed around on the world stage. For Xi, refusing to budge in the trade war may preempt future challenges from adversaries \u2013 and prove that China is a force to be reckoned with.\n\n[Huawei is better positioned to spy on us than we think]\n\nThis is an important point because the United States isn\u2019t the only nation that currently rails against China\u2019s unfair trade practices, including forced technology transfers and intellectual property theft. As Chinese telecom giant Huawei seeks to penetrate new markets with its 5G technology, countries like the United Kingdom have also been reluctant to do business with China.\n\nChina\u2019s immovability in the trade war could make competitor nations less likely to pick a fight with it going forward. By refusing to blink, Xi is signaling that China won\u2019t be bullied, that it\u2019s ready for the long game \u2013 and unafraid to retaliate against countries that cross it.\n\nUltimately, the U.S.-China trade war is about economics. But it\u2019s about politics, too. Politically, it looks like China has plenty of reasons to keep fighting.\n\nDon\u2019t miss anything!
