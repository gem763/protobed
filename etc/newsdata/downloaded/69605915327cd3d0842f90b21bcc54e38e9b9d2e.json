Goldman no longer has any day-to-day responsibilities at the company but is listed on Western LNG\u2019s leadership page. He also co-founded an investment group that funded projects related to \u201cnatural resources and energy,\u201d in part.\n\nGoldman has close ties to the Biden campaign and was an adviser to the candidate when he was in the Senate.\n\n\u201cWhat I was told by my staff is he did not have any responsibility relating to the company,\u201d Biden said Wednesday when asked about his ties to Goldman. \u201cHe was not on the board, he was not involved at all in the operation of the company at all. But if that turns out to be true, I will not in any way accept his help. We check every single contribution.\u201d\n\nBiden signed the fossil fuel pledge in June, promising not to accept any campaign contributions over $200 from PACs, lobbyists or fossil fuel executives named by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nWhat @andersoncooper just said about VP Biden's fundraiser is factually incorrect. Andrew Goldman isn't a fossil fuel executive. He's not involved in the day to day operation. He's not on the board of the company, nor the board of the portfolio company. \u2014 Symone D. Sanders (@SymoneDSanders) September 5, 2019\n\nThe Biden campaign aggressively defended itself after the question made the rounds on social media, saying the characterization was \u201cfactually incorrect\u201d and that he hadn\u2019t violated the pledge. Biden\u2019s team did not immediately respond to a request for comment on his remarks Thursday.\n\nBut, as HuffPost\u2019s Chris D\u2019Angelo noted this week, the argument about what constitutes an \u201cexecutive\u201d is largely semantic. The Sunrise Movement, a youth-led coalition of environmental activists who helped garner support for the Green New Deal, said Biden\u2019s engagement with Goldman \u201cclearly violates the spirit\u201d of the pledge.\n\nThe fundraiser on Thursday drew a small contingent of protesters who chanted \u201cNo fossil fuel money!\u201d and \u201cHey hey, hey, Joe, fracked gas has got to go.\u201d\n\nClimate activists protesting on CPW at site where Joe Biden is believed to be attending a fundraiser co-hosted by the co-founder of a company in the natural gas industry, which they say violates a pledge not to take large donations from fossil-fuel industry. pic.twitter.com/yrwQXTnkD7 \u2014 Anne Barnard (@ABarnardNYT) September 5, 2019\n\nLet's be clear. The rules of the #NoFossilFuelMoney pledge are there to help candidates stay in compliance. They are *NOT* there to help candidates weasel out of it. This from @JoeBiden at #ClimateTownHall feels very much like that latter. And that's...not a good look. \u2014 David Turnbull (@david_turnbull) September 5, 2019\n\nClimate change has become one of the key issues of the 2020 presidential race, and many of the Democratic candidates have unveiled detailed, trillion-dollar plans to address the crisis should they unseat President Donald Trump. Biden initially faced criticism amid reports that he was planning to unveil a \u201cmiddle ground\u201d approach to the issue but responded with his own policy based on the Green New Deal that would decarbonize the U.S. economy by 2050.\n\nBiden\u2019s plan only addresses fossil fuels in vague terms, but he has received a B+ rating from Greenpeace and support from 350 Action and Data for Progress for his stance on climate issues.", "description": "\"I am committed to not raising money from fossil fuel executives,\" Biden said at the event, co-hosted by one of the founders of natural gas company Weste...", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d71d70e3b0000ea55d01af5.jpeg?cache=xgadyc9j1s&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
