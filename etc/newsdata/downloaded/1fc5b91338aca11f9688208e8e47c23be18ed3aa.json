(Carlos Barria/Reuters)\n\nMaking the click-through worthwhile: The arguments in favor of keeping the early portion of the impeachment process secret and behind closed doors start to falter; Joe Biden continues to look really good for a candidate who\u2019s supposed to be a dead man walking; and NBC News hopes you\u2019ll forget recent history.\n\nWhen Does the Open Part of Impeachment Start?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m not a fan of bringing cell phones into Sensitive Compartmentalized Information Facilities \u2014 although Will Collier, who spent the better part of 20 years working in SCIFs every day, observes on the home page today that a \u201cfirst offense will result in a verbal scolding and an admonishment to go forth and sin no more.\u201d\n\nNor am I a fan of big show-y protests by members of Congress. You guys have the powers of your offices, you shouldn\u2019t need to make a scene like Code Pink or Shut Down DC. You notice that Code Pink and Shut Down DC rarely achieve the political goals they set out to accomplish, and mostly succeed in irritating everyone around them.\n\nBut yesterday, Amy Walter, the national editor of the Cook Political Report and pretty darn far away from being a partisan of any stripe, asked a simple question: \u201cCan anyone tell me why Dems can\u2019t make these hearings with officials involved in the Ukraine issue open? or, why we don\u2019t have any transcripts?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe most common justification is that this is like a grand jury portion of a criminal hearing, and the committee majority and their staff, acting as the equivalent of prosecutors, don\u2019t want the witnesses and potential witnesses to coordinate their testimony. This answer would be a little more compelling if we weren\u2019t getting considerable leaks of information, which would seem to undermine that objective. Bill Taylor\u2019s detailed, 16-page opening statement was first in the Washington Post but eventually posted everywhere \u2013 Time magazine, CBS News, CNN, PBS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for what it\u2019s worth, committee members Eric Swalwell and David Cicilline contend witnesses are coordinating testimony anyway. The committee has few options to stop witnesses from getting together beforehand and saying, \u201cI\u2019m going to tell them X, don\u2019t tell them Y\u201d or meeting up after to keep their peers updated. In fact, it\u2019s almost inevitable:\n\nRep. Harley Rouda (D-CA), who said he could not \u201copine\u201d on whether it was clear that certain witnesses had coordinated with each other in the midst of the impeachment inquiry. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean that these witnesses haven\u2019t talked to each other over the last few months, because they\u2019re all operating in the same theater of Ukraine \u2014 many of them, obviously.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs far as we know, nothing involved in impeachment is classified because it would jeopardize national security. No one\u2019s discussing the technical specifications of the military aid we\u2019re sending to Ukraine, or intelligence sources and methods involved in watching Russian forces in eastern Ukraine, or anything like that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, there\u2019s a big irony about these ongoing secrecy fights. The administration insists that just about every possible administration official and document that the panel wants is covered by executive privilege. The idea behind executive privilege is that the president has a right to keep the advice he gets private, because otherwise people will self-censor themselves if they know their communications and statements could someday be publicly revealed. (Because the boundaries of executive privilege are pretty vague, most preceding presidents have tried to avoid forcing the issue. If you want to get a more restricted definition of what it covers under the law after a lengthy court fight, this is exactly how an administration should behave.)\n\nSo the argument of Schiff and friends right now is that this is not an appropriate application of this privilege, that the information must not be kept secret, and that the information must be revealed to the House . . . where it can only be discussed in a closed hearing because it has to be kept secret.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe complaint about the secrecy of these depositions will be greatly mitigated if all of the relevant testimony is repeated under oath in open hearings. And supposedly, that\u2019s coming down the road, although no one knows exactly when. Last week, Schiff wrote in a letter to his House colleagues, \u201cat a time that it will not jeopardize investigative equities, we will make the interview transcripts public, subject to any necessary redactions for classified or sensitive information.\u201d\n\nToday, our Kevin Williamson urges Nancy Pelosi to get the impeachment effort out from behind closed doors: \u201cThe time has come to act, Madame Speaker. Enough with the gutless calculation. The country needs leadership and, for our sins, you\u2019re what we\u2019ve got. Do your duty and open the people\u2019s business in the people\u2019s house to the people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack in late September, the word was House Democrats would finish up impeachment by Thanksgiving. That proved wildly overoptimistic; now the thinking is that the impeachment process will begin its public portion in mid-November; Pelosi is hoping to hold the impeachment vote before the December holidays.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat would set up Senate impeachment hearings in January, just about the worst possible time for any senator running for president. If you thought Joe Biden was showcasing his big, toothy, silly grin before . . .\n\nSpeaking of Biden, he\u2019s got a lot to grin about.\n\nThat Allegedly Inevitable Joe Biden Collapse Keeps Getting Delayed\n\nFor a guy who\u2019s supposed to be dead, Joe Biden looks pretty good.\n\nTake your pick of most of the recent polls. Sure, Quinnipiac has a new national poll out this morning that puts Elizabeth Warren up seven. But in Iowa, he\u2019s no worse than tied or maybe behind by a point or two. In New Hampshire he might be down but it\u2019s currently a close second \u2014 nothing to panic about yet, and that should be Warren\u2019s best state. He is still comfortably ahead in Nevada, and South Carolina still looks like a firewall. A bunch of the latest national polls are still showing Biden up by one to nine percentage points, and CNN unveiled a shocker yesterday that put him up 15. The latest one in California has him up by 15 points.\n\nA lot of prominent voices of the national media really want to tell the story of Elizabeth Warren overtaking him. The only nagging flaw in that dramatic narrative is it really hasn\u2019t happened yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe really good news for Joe Biden is that all of this has happened when he\u2019s had a pretty lousy set of news cycles. The Hunter Biden stuff looks bad and creates a real vulnerability for the general election. Biden\u2019s debate performances of range from okay to pretty bad. His fundraising is really \u201cmeh\u201d for a guy who\u2019s the former vice-president and would presumably have a national network of donors.\n\nBiden announced he was running in late April. We are now about a half a year into his campaign and I think it\u2019s safe to say that the Biden we see is the Biden we\u2019re going to get for the rest of this cycle. He is not going to shake the rust off and turn into a sharper or more articulate speaker or debater. And yet despite all these flaws, Joe Biden is still doing okay.\n\nIf you\u2019re a Democrat with lingering doubts about Joe Biden\u2019s ability to beat Donald Trump in a general election, you have every reason in the world to start freaking out right now. The one guy in this race who went after Biden hard on his age and mental acuity, Julian Castro, saw no benefit from it and maybe a mild backlash. Bernie Sanders isn\u2019t dropping out anytime soon and even seems a little rejuvenated after his heart attack (the AOC endorsement helps) and so we\u2019re likely to see Sanders and Warren fighting over the same voters well into this primary.\n\nEric Levitz had a smart piece in New York magazine about the faction of centrist Democrats who \u201cunintentionally placed all of its bets on an old, increasingly lame horse who was infamous for mounting lousy presidential runs when he was in his prime.\u201d\n\nSure, President Trump appears to be getting more erratic, angrier, less predictable and quicker to lash out at anyone he deems insufficiently loyal. His gaffes are getting odder \u2014 \u201cwe\u2019re building a wall in Colorado.\u201d It\u2019s quite possible the Democrats will end up nominating Biden, setting up a million political cartoons and memes referring to the Grumpy Old Men movies with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, or Statler and Waldorf from The Muppet Show. It\u2019s not hard to imagine disappointed woke Democrats feeling tempted to vote for a Green Party candidate again.\n\nNBC News, Feminist Icon\n\nNBC News proudly announces an all-women debate moderator lineup: \u201cthe Nov. 20 Democratic presidential debate, co-hosted by MSNBC and the Washington Post, will be hosted by Rachel Maddow, host of \u201cThe Rachel Maddow Show\u201d on MSNBC; Andrea Mitchell, host of \u201cAndrea Mitchell Reports\u201d on MSNBC and NBC News\u2019 chief foreign affairs correspondent; Kristen Welker, NBC News\u2019 White House correspondent; and Ashley Parker, a White House reporter for the Washington Post.\u201d\n\nI guess they figure most people will respond, \u201cYes! You go, girl! If there\u2019s any institution in this world that stands up for women and their rights, making sure that they\u2019re respected and treated properly, and that their mistreatment get addressed quickly and correctly, it\u2019s NBC News!\u201d\n\nADDENDA: People generally have no idea what \u201cMedicare for All\u201d includes or how it works.\n\nDemocratic Congresswoman Katie Hill denies the allegations that she had an affair with a congressional office staffer, but admits she did have an affair with a campaign staffer. That doesn\u2019t quite explain that from not-safe-for-work photo that RedState uncovered, but maybe the complimentary hair care from the boss in that office is just amazing.\n\nFinally, please read this Corner post all the way to the end.", "description": "The complaint about the secrecy of these depositions will be greatly\u00a0mitigated if the relevant testimony is repeated in open hearings.
