students need better support\n\nThe South African university student population has changed over the past 20 years to reflect wider society more closely than before.\n\nThe South African university student population has changed over the past 20 years to reflect wider society more closely than before.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise therefore that more students need support than before.\n\nThe homes they come from are also struggling.\n\nBut what is perhaps surprising is that students who are receiving government financial support are still vulnerable to hunger.\n\nThey are also reluctant to use the extra support that\u2019s available, and their health and studies suffer as a result.\n\nStudent vulnerability to hunger has emerged as an alarming problem at South African higher education institutions.\n\nThe National Student Financial Aid Scheme covers school fees, accommodation and a stipend, but is leaving a big gap: food.\n\nAt the University of KwaZulu-Natal, where nearly half the students are from poor households, meal vouchers and food hampers have been offered since 2012.\n\nResearch by my colleagues and I reviewed whether this is making a difference.\n\nWe found that more than half of the students in the study sometimes went hungry and that less than 10% of food insecure students, or those from poor households, had taken advantage of the program.\n\nThis is largely due to lack of program awareness, and negative perceptions associated with food handouts.\n\nFood insecurity impacts on students\u2019 ability to focus, attend class and therefore academic outcomes.\n\nAn urgent food security intervention is needed to stop this.\n\nMore students need to know about the program, and more needs to be done to keep students who are beneficiaries anonymous so that they don\u2019t feel ashamed to access it.\n\nIn addition to this, the government should offer financial support to campus food security interventions.\n\nFood insecurity\n\nFor the study, we asked 500 university students to participate using a questionnaire that included questions such as \u201chow many meals do you eat on a normal day?\u201d and \u201cin the last 30 days, did you eat smaller meals due to a lack of resources?\u201d\n\nWe explored how vulnerable they were to food insecurity using the household food insecurity access scale.\n\nThe experience of food insecurity causes certain reactions \u2013 such as feelings of uncertainty or anxiety \u2013 over food and responses \u2013 such as eating less food \u2013 which are put into a scale.\n\nThe study also examined what the students reported about their eating habits \u201cin normal circumstances\u201d.\n\nWe found that a vulnerability to food insecurity was evident in over half (51.3%) of the students.\n\nThese students sacrificed a meal due to a lack of resources.\n\nAbout 10% of them were highly vulnerable to food insecurity.\n\nBecause they couldn\u2019t afford it, these students either only ate one meal during the day, or would starve throughout the day and eat only at night.\n\nFood insecurity has a huge impact on health, well-being and academic performance.\n\nNearly 65% of the students indicated that hunger affected their energy levels and ability to think.\n\nAbout 30% of them were unable to attend class as a result.\n\nBeing food insecure was linked to students\u2019 source of funding and lack of resources.\n\nMore specifically, the most food insecure students were sponsored by the National Student Financial Aid Scheme and come from impoverished families.\n\nAlso Read: Student hunger at South African universities needs more attention\n\nPoverty stigma\n\nA big challenge we found is the negative perceptions students have about poverty and food insecurity.\n\nThis stigma led to negative attitudes about food aid: 43% of the students found it embarrassing to be food insecure.\n\nFood insecurity was perceived as a \u201cshameful secret\u201d among students and being a dependant on food handouts was closely associated with being \u201cvery poor\u201d.\n\nAs a result nearly 40% of food insecure students showed reluctance to use or recommend the much-needed university food security interventions.\n\nPrevious studies in the US and South Africa have reported similar trends of \u201cfood handout shyness\u201d among food insecure students.\n\nWay forward\n\nApart from having serious negative effects on their health, food insecurity has a negative impact on the socio-psychological state of the student and can lower their self-esteem.\n\nThis will affect their academic performance.\n\nDue to the negative perceptions associated with food aid among university students, and the lack of programme awareness, there needs to be more information available to stakeholders on interventions.\n\nThe interventions will also be more sustainable if a well-established monitoring and evaluation system is in place.\n\nTo make food security sustainable, I also suggest gardening interventions.\n\nFor example, in the US, the establishment of a free community market helped to address the problem of food insecurity and stigma associated with taking advantage of opportunities for free food.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.
