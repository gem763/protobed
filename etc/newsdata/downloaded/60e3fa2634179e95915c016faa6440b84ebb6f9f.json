But whereas the ambiguity of the US withdrawal timeframe gave the Kurds some sort of leverage in their negotiations, the spontaneous decision made by Trump also gave Damascus a huge negotiating advantage over the Kurds.\n\nSo we now have the situation where Turkey and some of its not-so-savoury Syrian militiamen have invaded Syria, and negotiated a ceasefire through the US that on the face of it solidifies Turkish operational aims.\n\nMeanwhile, Syrian and Russian troops are deploying into positions previously manned by the United States, which in turn has had to destroy one of its ammunition storage facilities, lest it fall into the hands of Turkish-backed forces.\n\nTurkey\u2019s invasion and Trump\u2019s response to it has exacted a toll not only on the people of northern Syria but also on Washington\u2019s reputation as a reliable partner. Democracies are robust entities, however, and the reputational damage won\u2019t be permanent even if the stain will be there for some time.\n\nWestern governments are also concerned about two possible by-products of the Turkish ground invasion and the departure of the US and coalition forces. The first is the threat made by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to allow 3.6 million Syrian refugees to flood into Europe if the Europeans continue to refer to the Turkish military operation as an invasion. It is debatable whether his threat is real or simply rhetoric, given that he has also said the secondary aim of his intervention into Syria is to return those same refugees to Syria.\n\nThe second area of concern is the fate of Islamic State detainees \u2013 the male and female members and their children. A limited number of male fighters have escaped already and the fate of thousands of others is still up in the air. The Kurds are still in charge of their security and while they say they are maintaining it for the moment, their ability to do so without US support is a real dilemma.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhere the buck stops\n\nTrump has said the Turks would now be responsible, but given the location of some of the largest camps well outside the self-declared Turkish security zone as well as the logistical, political and legal overheads inherent in taking responsibility, Ankara has refused responsibility for camps located outside this zone.\n\nWhether the Syrian government would look at taking responsibility through the Kurds, or whether the Syrians or Kurds themselves could demand a price from the prisoners\u2019 countries of origins to maintain security, are possibilities that can\u2019t be discounted.\n\nBut the luxury of time that Canberra and other Western and regional capitals had in dealing with their nationals detained in these camps is fast disappearing. Third country removals to somewhere like Iraq, whose detainees number in their thousands, could be explored, or the timetable could be expedited for the repatriation of foreign nationals to their country\u2019s legal systems.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the question of those former Australian and British citizens whose citizenship has been stripped from them. There will be no easy policy fixes to the problem created by those who joined Islamic State but who in defeat now seek the support of the very country they rejected.", "description": "The Kurds will have to make their peace with Bashar al-Assad.
