Costello (bruised right thumb) for a third straight game, had a two-game winning streak come to an end.\n\nAfter Jet Toner had put the Cardinal on top with a 42-yard field goal at the end of Stanford's first offensive possession, Thompson-Robinson marched UCLA 69 yards in nine plays for a score that gave the Bruins the upper hand for good.\n\nImmediately demonstrating he was over the ankle injury that had kept him out of UCLA's previous game, Thompson-Robinson threw 19 yards to Phillips for the 7-3 lead.\n\nLess than four minutes later, the duo clicked again, this time from 3 yards to cap a five-play, 50-yard drive that produced a 14-3 lead with 4:48 left in the first quarter.\n\nStanford used a blocked punt by Spencer Jorgensen and recovery in the end zone by Brycen Tremayne to close the gap to 14-10 late in the first period, but UCLA rebounded to score the game's next 20 points to pull away.\n\nThompson-Robinson made it 21-10 before halftime with a 1-yard TD run, Molson connected on his two field goals in the third quarter, and Kelley cashed in his long run with 6:55 to play to push the UCLA lead to 34-10.\n\nStanford's Cameron Scarlett ran in from 6 yards out with 2:50 to go to cap the game's scoring.\n\nThompson-Robinson went 21-for-34 for 192 yards and the two touchdowns, with one interception, for the Bruins, who outgained the Cardinal 455-198.\n\nKelley was the game's leading rusher with 176 yards on 18 carries, while Phillips reached 100 yards receiving on 10 catches.\n\nJack West threw for just 143 yards on 15-for-32 passing for Stanford, which had scored a total of 107 points in its previous two wins over UCLA.\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "Dorian Thompson-Robinson threw for two touchdowns and ran for a third, and the  UCLA defense held Stanford without an offensive touchdown for 57 minutes ...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
