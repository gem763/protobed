That price tag puts it ahead of the Walker Fire in California, which the Idaho center says cost about $29 million to fight. A fire in Montana cost about $6 million, and one in Idaho cost about $5 million to battle.\n\nAlaska\u2019s fire started by a lightning strike in June in the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge. Rain in late July reduced fire activity, but it flared again in August in hot, dry conditions.\n\nResidents of Cooper Landing were told to be ready to evacuate if needed, but that restriction was lifted Sept. 17. Smoke from the fires enveloped Anchorage at times, leaving the city hazy and smelling like a campfire.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

There are 265 firefighters battling the wildlife. Hundreds of crews were cycled in and out of the Lower 48 to battle the blaze.\n\nGenerally, costs tend to increase on large fires with large numbers of crews, planes and other air support are used, and there are homes nearby that need protection, National Interagency Fire Center spokeswoman Jessica Gardetto told the Anchorage Daily News.\n\nWhile costly, it\u2019s not Alaska\u2019s most expensive fire once you factor in inflation. That distinction goes to the Swanson River Fire, which burned 50 years ago, also on the Kenai Peninsula. \u201cThat fire cost over $9 million in 1969,\u201d said Tim Mowry, a spokesman for the Alaska Division of Forestry. \u201cWhen you punch that into the whole inflation calculator, it came up $63 million.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "The Swan Lake fire started with a lightning strike in June in the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge.
