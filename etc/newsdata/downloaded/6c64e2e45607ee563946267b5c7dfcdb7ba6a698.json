Sometimes, I see the parents. I go to Dover [Air Force Base] when I can, but it\u2019s so devastating for the parents, so, you know.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump, facing down an impeachment inquiry, possibly fading economy and a re-election effort, tipped his hand. Despite leading an often imprudently hawkish administration, America\u2019s most controversial politician revealed an enduring core conviction that helped vault him to power: Trump still wants America out of the Middle East. As David Sanger writes in The New York Times, Trump\u2019s decision this week to make way for Turkey in Syria is \u201canother example of the independent, parallel foreign policy he has run from the White House.\u201d\n\nThe president was almost certainly persuaded to allow the Turkish move because of a dynamic underreported in American media: Trump\u2019s personal rapport with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Trump critics assume the worst\u2014that Trump\u2019s family has designs on business ventures in Istanbul after the White House years\u2014but that critique deemphasizes the more obvious: Trump and Erdogan, fellow nationalists, get on. As TAC\u2019s Mark Perry has reported, Trump\u2019s chumminess with the controversial Turkish leader was instrumental in motivating the president\u2019s last attempted pullout in the region, a stillborn effort last December.\n\nTrump relayed: \u201cThat door comes down. And they are walking the coffin, with their boy inside this coffin, with an American flag over the top. \u2026 I\u2019ve seen people that I thought were really incredible\u2026 Scream. Like I\u2019ve never seen anything before. Sometimes, they\u2019ll run to the coffin. They\u2019ll break through military barriers, they\u2019ll run to the coffin and jump onto the coffin.\u201d Trump, who recently mocked his primacist former national security advisor John Bolton, as a \u201ctough guy\u201d said, \u201cIt\u2019s easy to talk tough. All these tough guys. \u2018Let\u2019s keep fighting. Let\u2019s keep fighting.\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s laudable decision to side with America\u2019s formal NATO ally in Ankara over a de facto partnership with the Kurds of north Syria drew the usual partisan rancor. The reaction from Democrats was routine, emblematic of a hyper-partisan America heading into an election year. Former Barack Obama national security advisor Susan Rice asked \u201cwhat is he smoking?\u201d and said the decision was \u201cbatshit crazy.\u201d But the Democrats are not in power. More telling: Trump\u2019s reception among Republicans.\n\nTrump ally Senator Lindsey Graham called the Turkey decision a \u201cdisaster in the making.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the move would be an abdication of American leadership. Senator Ted Cruz called the move, if consummated, \u201cdisgraceful.\u201d And leading Trump antagonist Senator Mitt Romney said Trump had \u201cshamefully betrayed\u201d the Kurds.\n\nIt\u2019s here where Trump\u2019s foreign policy prerogatives dovetail with his domestic concerns.\n\nTrump\u2019s frenemies\u2014McConnell, Cruz, Marco Rubio, and perhaps above all, Romney\u2014will decide his impeachment fate. As TAC editor Jim Antle put it this week: \u201cChaotic policymaking process aside, it says a lot about the state of D.C. that Trump may have marginally increased his chances of being removed from office by attempting to end a war Congress never authorized in the first place.\u201d\n\nCompared to Trump, the Republican heir apparent, Vice President Mike Pence, is a company man. Pence is generally portrayed as laughably obsequious to the current president. But there is something the veep is even more deferential to: his party\u2019s orthodoxy. For adherents to the old religion, a President Pence would be manna from heaven, a resuscitation of the conservative three-legged stool. Pence is everything Trump is not. In addition his less assuming, midwestern looks, Pence is authentically devout, an unquestioning free marketeer and an unapologetic hawk.\n\nPence\u2019s top aide, vice presidential chief of staff Marc Short, is notorious for neoconservative sympathies. Unlike other top Trump officials, such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Pence has never publicly said he believes the 2003 invasion of Iraq to have been a mistake. In this way, Pence is more like the recently departed Bolton than the president he serves.\n\nThe degree to which Trump\u2019s true foreign policy preferences needle the Republican operative class is clear. Such frustration is on display on the \u201cMorning Joe\u201d circuit. As MoJo regular, ex-Cruz aide Rick Tyler characterized the president\u2019s remarks Thursday, \u201cI\u2019ve never been more angry with [Trump] as I was watching him exploit the suffering of military families at Dover for political purposes.\u201d\n\nPence would be less of a pill. As TAC\u2019s Barbara Boland outlines, a Pence administration \u201cwould likely adopt a \u2018values agenda,\u2019 with a greater emphasis on democracy development and human rights, reminiscent of the policies of George W. Bush.\u201d Many observers have noted a striking address this year by the vice president to graduating West Point cadets in which Pence emphasized that the world remains \u201ca dangerous place.\u201d Unlike Trump, who decries \u201cendless wars,\u201d Pence told the gathered in New York: \u201cIt is a virtual certainty that you will fight on a battlefield for America.\u201d\n\nTrump may yet remake the Republican Party for good. If the next elected Republican president is a Tucker Carlson or a Matt Gaetz, it\u2019s hard to see a conservative movement that will not have to adjust to a neo-Buchananite revolution and a more responsible foreign policy. But for now, Trump swims with the sharks he reportedly wanted to place in the Rio Grande: Senate Republicans who are more bankster than Buchanan.\n\nLeading Democrats are licking their chops. The terrain for actual removal remains difficult, however. Said Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia: \u201cTry as I might, I can\u2019t find 20 Republican Senators who would vote to convict and thus oust Trump. I can find five or six who might, under the worst set of circumstances for Trump. \u2026 We do know that Trump\u2019s base. \u2026 probably won\u2019t turn on the president for any reason, ever.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s a strange moment in Washington. As conservative billionaire Peter Thiel recently said of the U.S.-China fight, \u201cboth sides think they are going to lose.\u201d The impeachment fracas is the same. Trump allies are nervous. A former senior administration official, sizing up the 2020 campaign, asked \u201cif\u201d there will even be an incumbent President Trump running for re-election.\n\nWith a doctrinaire vice president waiting in the wings, the question isn\u2019t academic.\n\nCurt Mills is senior writer for The American Conservative.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/33096700766_3ddd9d510f_z.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
