Getty\n\nABN Amro dropped as much as 10.3 per cent in Amsterdam trading, the most since June 2016. The Dutch bank\u2019s Additional Tier 1 bonds fell the most in six months following news of the probe.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much uncertainty for the shareholders now,\u201d said KBW analyst Jean-Pierre Lambert by phone. \u201cThe big question is whether there\u2019s actual money laundering involved in this case. That\u2019s what the prosecutor\u2019s investigation probably is trying to find out.\u201d\n\nThe Dutch bank said in July said that it needs to review all of its 5 million retail clients after receiving a warning from the Dutch central bank. ABN Amro took a \u20ac114m provision for the checks in the second quarter, after already setting aside 85 million euros at the end of last year for stepping up financial crime prevention in commercial banking and the credit card business.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to estimate the extent of any wrong-doing at this stage,\u201d said Philip Richards, a Bloomberg Intelligence banking analyst. The lender took a \u20ac114m provision in [the second quarter], after the Dutch central bank required it to review all domestic retail clients under customer due diligence requirements, so it has already begun addressing the issue.\n\nThe bank said at the time that sanctions may be imposed by the authorities but said it hasn\u2019t made a provision for a possible fine as the \u201camount cannot be estimated at this time\u201d.\n\nThe investigation and the resulting share price drop may make it harder for the Dutch government \u2013 which still owns 56 per cent after a bailout in 2009 \u2013 to sell off the rest of its stake as it pledged to do during the bank\u2019s IPO in 2015. Meanwhile, the bank is still looking for a new chief executive officer after Kees van Dijkhuizen announced in June that he will leave when his term ends in April.\n\nFollowing the ING fine and the central bank\u2019s criticism, the largest Dutch banks have been stepping up compliance spending, including adding more staff to its crime prevention teams. Earlier this month, five of the country\u2019s largest lenders said they are exploring a system to jointly monitor transactions in the fight against money laundering after the government pledged to clear legal hurdles that might prevent them from doing so.\n\nBloomberg", "description": "Europe\u2019s widening money laundering scandals took a new turn on Thursday as Dutch lender ABN Amro Bank\u00a0disclosed a criminal probe over alleged failures to check on clients and report suspicious transactions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2015/04/15/17/ABN-amro.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
