For that to happen, the EU needs to engage fully with the proposals we have put forward,\u201d the spokesman said, briefing journalists on Monday.\n\n\u201cThe PM believes that we have set out a fair and sensible compromise, and we are now looking to the EU to match the compromises that the UK has made.\u201d\n\nWith just 10 days to go until EU leaders are due to meet in Brussels for their final European council meeting before the Brexit deadline, there has been scant evidence of any progress.\n\nIn particular, the EU has flatly rejected the UK\u2019s suggestion that Northern Ireland exit the customs union. That would necessitate customs checks on the island of Ireland \u2013 though the government insists they could take place away from the border.\n\nJohnson\u2019s spokesman said the government was determined not to budge on this point.\n\n\u201cThe PM set out in his letter, that this provided a broad landing zone, and we were willing to engage in further discussions on our proposals. But if your question is are we prepared for Northern Ireland to be in a different customs territory to the UK, the answer is a very firm no.\u201d\n\nDespite the tight deadline for securing a deal, Johnson currently has no plans to visit EU leaders for face-to-face talks. \u201cThere isn\u2019t anything in the diary at present,\u201d said the spokesman.\n\nHe said Johnson was expected to hold discussions with the Swedish, Danish and Polish prime ministers by telephone on Monday, after speaking to Macron on Sunday.\n\nJohnson was asked about the state of the Brexit negotiations while visiting a hospital on Monday morning.\n\nHe said the government had made a significant compromise in agreeing that Northern Ireland should remain aligned to EU rules for goods and agriculture \u2013 subject to agreement by Stormont \u2013 and called for the EU to make clear its objections to his plans.\n\n\u201cWhat we are saying to our friends is, this is a very generous, fair and reasonable offer that we have made. What we would like to hear from you now is what your thoughts are. And if you have issues with any of the proposals that we\u2019ve come up with, then let\u2019s get into the detail and discuss them,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter declining to meet with the prime minister in person, Macron insisted during a phone call on Sunday that the talks would only be advanced through Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator.\n\n\u201cBoris Johnson presented his latest proposals,\u201d an official at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace said of the conversation. \u201cThe president told him that the negotiations should continue swiftly with Michel Barnier\u2019s team in coming days, in order to evaluate at the end of the week whether a deal is possible that respects European Union principles.\u201d\n\nBarnier has already said he does not have a mandate from the EU27 to agree a deal on the terms so far presented by Downing Street.\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s chief negotiator, David Frost, has also been repeatedly told there will no last-minute negotiations with leaders at the summit on 17 October.\n\nBefore Johnson set out his Brexit proposals in his party conference speech, No 10 suggested that if the EU27 declined to engage, the government would press ahead towards a no-deal departure.\n\n\u201cThe government is either going to be negotiating a new deal or working on no deal \u2013 nobody will work on delay. We will keep fighting to respect the biggest democratic vote in British history,\u201d a senior official said at the time.\n\nUK retailers demand Brexit deal after worst September on record Read more\n\nDowning Street continues to insist that the UK will leave the EU on 31 October, despite government lawyers having conceded last week in the Scottish courts that Johnson would have to comply with the Benn act.\n\nThat legislation, drawn up by a cross-party group of backbenchers, obliges the government to write a letter to the EU27, requesting an extension to article 50 \u2013 and to accept that extension \u2013 if parliament has not agreed to a Brexit deal before 19 October.\n\n\u201cWe want to secure a deal, because it\u2019s in the best interests of the UK and the EU to work together to reach that agreement \u2013 but without one, we will be leaving on October 31,\u201d Johnson\u2019s spokesman insisted.\n\nAsked how that could be the case, given the requirements set out in the Benn law, he added, \u201cthe manner in which this policy is lawfully achieved is a matter for the government\u201d.", "description": "Spokesman says PM is waiting for EU to engage with proposals after cool response so far", "authors": ["Heather Stewart", "Daniel Boffey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e38d9689c69f970a675d2d2a81b69ff4d805b205/487_169_3925_2355/master/3925.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=15cf3179c08e72e45c5ebb505e152665", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
