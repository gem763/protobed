Consumers can guess that the World Wildlife Fund's panda logo has something to do with animals. This is true even for more abstract descriptive logos. Spotify's logo, with is three curved stripes, denotes sound waves. Suddenly it makes sense when a consumer learns it's a music streaming service.\n\nEven logos that reference a company's name, as opposed to its function, are descriptive, like Apple's logo. With a concrete image, consumers have a better idea of that company's brand.\n\nUnderstanding a company's brand could mean customers are more likely to buy from it. That's why, the researchers argue, descriptiveness makes a logo feel more authentic, and people are in turn more inclined to buy.\n\nAccording to the study, \"logo descriptiveness can positively affect impressions of authenticity and, in turn, purchase intentions.\"\n\nThe study also looked at the profitability of these companies, and found that there was a \"significant positive association between logo descriptiveness and gross profit.\"\n\nTo do this, the researchers used control variables like symmetry, color, and shape to account for differences in logos, then compared net sales.\n\nThe only negative side of descriptive logos, say the researchers, is when the company in question deals with unappealing products or services, like a funeral home or bug repellent.\n\nIf fledgling companies want to be successful, say the researchers, they should think deeply about their logos. While it may be a clich\u00e9, including a book in your bookstore's logo could help business \u2014 especially if you do it in a unique, creative way. But if you're creating a company with several unrelated ventures, like the next Uber or Disney, don't be too concerned with adding cartoon cars or Mickey Mouse.", "description": "Today's trendy minimalist logos aren't authentic or likable, according to a new report in the Harvard Business Review.", "authors": ["Ivan De Luce"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7aa6a82e22af13061b94a7-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
