She was 95.\n\nClaus Raefle, a German movie director who knew L\u00e9vy, said Wednesday that L\u00e9vy's family informed him she had died overnight at her home in Paris. Her death was first reported by Jewish weekly Juedische Allgemeine.\n\nRaefle's 2017 film \"The Invisibles\" tells the story of four Jews, including L\u00e9vy, trying to avoid deportation in the capital of Nazi Germany.\n\nBorn Hanni Wei\u00dfenberg in 1924, L\u00e9vy later recounted how she colored her hair blond and assumed the name Hannelore Winkler to evade suspicion. With the Nazis searching for her, L\u00e9vy managed to find shelter with non-Jewish Berliners who Israel honored after the war as Righteous Among the Nations.\n\nAbout 1,700 Jews survived the Holocaust in Berlin.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
