Stick in a DVD of Liverpool's 2013-14 season and it will fit seamlessly.\n\nWe should start with the positives of the 4-1 victory which keeps Liverpool on course for the knockout stage.\n\nThere was a moment at Old Trafford on Sunday when Oxlade-Chamberlain took possession 25 yards from goal, dropped the shoulder and played a timid sideways pass to a teammate.\n\nOn the touchline, Jurgen Klopp was enraged, the cameras picking up his screams urging his midfielder to drive forward and use the shooting power which prompted Liverpool to sign him.\n\nWith such instructions still giving him tinnitus, three days later Oxlade-Chamberlain took the direct route in the Genk Arena. It took him 151 seconds to score his first and he doubled his tally in more spectacular style after the interval.", "description": "He may have made his comeback from a serious knee injury five months ago, but Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain may finally consider his rehabilitation complete.", "authors": ["Chris Bascombe", "Alan Tyers"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/23/TELEMMGLPICT000213929486-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqYbHyc_BzkV-wGdElElElaF_4NaGuRs-e5VdogAk2McY.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
