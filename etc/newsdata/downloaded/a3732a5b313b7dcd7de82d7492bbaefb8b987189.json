President Trump also rejected suggestions that the U.S. would accept a partial trade agreement with China, saying his administration is \"looking for a complete deal.\"\n\n\"I think this is the case of, well, we had the promise of more talks but where do we go from here?,\" said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading firm IG Group\n\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 fell 0.7% in opening trade, with losses across most regional indexes, after a broadly lower session in Asia.\n\nShares in airplane and travel companies rose following the collapse of British travel group Thomas Cook Group PLC after failing to conclude a rescue deal with investors and creditors, canceling all bookings and forcing U.K. authorities to help get thousands of vacationers home. Shares in travel company TUI AG rose 9.5% and shares in EasyJet PLC gained 5.8%.\n\nChinese shares fell on Monday, amid concerns about the faltering trade talks. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index closed nearly 1% lower, while its smaller Shenzhen counterpart fell slightly more than 1%.\n\n\"The farm visit news was certainly a factor but having said that, investors' expectations for a quick resolution had been pretty low in the first place,\" said Zhang Gang, senior analyst at Central China Securities, saying the declines were relatively limited by Chinese standards.\n\nTwists and turns on the trade front aside, the Chinese central bank's decision to hold a key medium-term interest rate steady last week has continued to weigh on sentiment, Mr. Zhang said. \"There are few signs that the authorities will significantly loosen monetary policy in the near term,\" he added.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng fell 0.7% after another weekend of protests. Japan's Nikkei 225 was closed for a holiday, and Korea's Kospi was flat.\n\nIndian shares were a bright spot, hitting a two-month high as the government's measures to prop up sluggish economic growth boost investor sentiment.\n\nBrent crude oil rose 0.9% to $63.76 a barrel after The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday that the Saudi Arabian Oil Co. was offering equipment makers and service providers a premium for parts and repair work as it seeks to restore operations hampered by an attack on oil facilities earlier this month.\n\nIt may take many months -- rather than the maximum 10 weeks company executives have promised -- to restore operations to full working order, Saudi officials and oil contractors said.\n\nThe yield on the 10-Year Treasury edged down to 1.749% from 1.754% on Friday afternoon. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.\n\nThe euro fell 0.5% against the U.S. dollar after French and German manufacturing and services data came in weaker than expected. The yield on the German 10-year bund also dropped to minus 0.564% as investors reached for safe government bonds.\n\nShen Hong contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 23, 2019 04:23 ET (08:23 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
