Our vision is for a world in which zero emission vehicles, public transport and self-driving pods will form one smart integrated and networked transport system.\n\n'At Gaydon, we have invested into the future and an inspiring environment for our people.\n\n'We have created the prerequisites that Gaydon can design and engineer the next generations of outstanding cars in highest quality. We have consciously invested with a 'Destination Zero' attitude.'\n\nThe facility is designed to encourage collaboration throughout the entire process of vehicle development \u2013 from the first outline sketch to the finished car in the showroom\n\nJLR said the \u00a3500m investment in Gaydon aimed at achieving \u2018a future of zero emissions, zero accidents and zero congestion\u2019 across its facilities\n\nThe team will be able to use in-house digitalisation at every stage of the process, from sketching through to launch animations\n\nJLR added: \u2018Investing in a future that is autonomous, connected, electrified and shared, Jaguar Land Rover has already successfully tested self-driving vehicles on complicated inner-city roads.\n\n\u2018It is working in collaboration with academia and leading technology companies to deliver relentless innovation across its future vehicles and services. \u2018\n\nThis includes running of a fleet of all-electric Jaguar I-Pace taxis in Munich.\n\nThe new Land Rover Defender, to be built in Slovakia, was also created at the centre as construction was still underway.\n\nJLR has relocated design and engineering from its Whitley site in Coventry which will be redeveloped to concentrate on powertrain engine and gearbox testing.\n\nJLR said the \u00a3500m investment in Gaydon aimed at achieving \u2018a future of zero emissions, zero accidents and zero congestion\u2019 across its facilities, and through its products and services.\n\nThe site has \u2018an ecologically diverse area\u2019 that reuses 80,000m\u00b3 of natural soil - equivalent of 30 Olympic sized pools - excavated during construction\n\nThe new Gaydon offices are also \u2018green\u2019 with up to 20% of their energy coming from nearly 3,000m\u00b2 of solar panels on the roof\n\nTo this end the firm showcased the latest vehicles and research technologies it hopes will deliver this including: development of 3D printed gloves; sensory steering wheels; and re-cycling domestic waste to create high quality materials for vehicles.\n\nThe new Gaydon offices are also \u2018green\u2019 with up to 20 per cent of their energy coming from nearly 3,000m\u00b2 of solar panels on the roof.\n\nThe same glazing technology as used by the Eden Project has been used to bring natural light into the building and make it more energy efficient.\n\nThey have been created \u2018to bring the outside in\u2019 with lots of natural light and interior landscaping to promote the personal health, well-being and productivity of its employees.\n\nThey are already rated in the top 10 per cent of the greenest non-domestic buildings in the UK.\n\nThe new Land Rover Defender is now in full production at the firm's factory in Slovakia\n\nThe Nitra plant is a \u00a31billion facility that will be the home of Land Rover's reborn Defender as well as other SUV models\n\nThe site includes \u2018an ecologically diverse area\u2019 that reuses 80,000m\u00b3 of natural soil - equivalent of 30 Olympic sized pools - excavated during construction.\n\nLast year Jaguar Land Rover sold 592,708 vehicles in 128 countries.\n\nOwned by India\u2019s giant TATA conglomerate, JLR says \u2018at heart we are a British company\u2019 with three UK vehicle manufacturing facilities: at Castle Bromwich and Solihull in Birmingham and Halewood on Mersyside; an engine plant in Wolverhampton and a soon to be opened Battery Assembly Centre.\n\nIt also has vehicle plants in China, Brazil, India, Austria and Slovakia.", "description": "In the face of Brexit uncertainty, JLR boss Prof Sir Ralf Speth opened the new complex on Thursday morning, which is where engineers will work together to plan its next-generation models.", "authors": ["Ray Massey For Mailonline And Thisismoney", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
