They\u2019re pointing at other people who are somehow falling short of their standards, which could have changed three weeks ago. They\u2019re constantly moving the goalposts so they can go, \u201cGotcha!\u201d For example, when I was growing up, the most liberal thing you could do is not see color. Well, that\u2019s wrong now. You see color, always, so you can register your white privilege. But I grew up in the Martin Luther King era: Judge by the content of their character, not the color of their skin. I still think that\u2019s the best way to do it. Not see it.\u201d\n\nMr. Maher said the media is being largely controlled by social media, which he described as being made up of whiny, entitled millennials who grew up with \u201chelicopter parents\u201d and were raised to be much more \u201cfragile\u201d than previous generations.\n\n\u201cThe Twitter-mob mentality has an effect on the rest of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone fears the wrath of the Twitter mob and the social justice warriors and the P.C. police. Religions always talk about the one true religion. Now on the left, we have the one true opinion. If you go against that, you do so at your peril. That\u2019s why the air on the left is becoming stale. I railed for years against the Fox News bubble, and that is as strong as ever, but I didn\u2019t think it would get this bad on the left. Comedians are afraid to make jokes in clubs, because somebody will tape it and send it out on Twitter and get the mob after you.\n\n\u201cThe politically correct people are not concerned about social justice,\u201d he added. \u201cThey care about putting scalps on the wall.\u201d\n\nMr. Maher said the most important strategy that the Democrats could take ahead of the 2020 election would be to \u201cbroom this element out\u201d of the party and \u201cstand up to the Twitter mob and the ultrawoke.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
