We\u2019ll see what will happens next summer,\u2019 Havertz told Sky in Germany in September.\n\nLeverkusen want around \u00a385m for their prized asset, but United are seemingly willing to meet that asking price.\n\nMuller, 30, is not the guaranteed starter he used to be at Bayern Munich and would be available if the right bid came in.\n\nThomas Muller has long been linked with Manchester United (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nThe veteran has not hit double figures in terms of goals in the Bundesliga since 2015-16, but is still appealing to the Old Trafford hierarchy who are looking to improve their forward line.\n\nThe World Cup winner was asked recently about his future and was dismissive of the transfer talk, saying: \u2018I try to focus on playing football and gradually all the speculation will die down a bit.\u2019\n\nEx-Bayern manager Ottmar Hitzfeld says it is hard to see the forward leaving Bayern, but would not rule out an exit.\n\n\u2018Thomas Muller at another club is hard to imagine for me. He is an absolute identification figure for Bayern,\u2019 he told Goal.\n\n\u2018He has played there since he was small and has matured into a world-class player, has won many titles.\n\n\u2018But in the end it is his decision if he wants to do something else. You have to respect that.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth would be major signings for the Red Devils, but Havertz would certainly be the more significant given his potential to become one of the biggest stars in world football, if his trajectory continues.\n\nMORE: Jurgen Klopp admits Liverpool need to improve to get the better of Manchester United\n\nMORE: Manchester United have a \u2018massive problem\u2019 up front and won\u2019t make the top four, says Jamie Carragher", "description": "Manchester United will be trying to do big business in January after Ed Woodward sanction a \u00a3125m raid on Germany for Thomas Muller and Kai Havertz.
