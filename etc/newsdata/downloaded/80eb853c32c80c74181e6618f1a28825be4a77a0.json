Officials said Sunday that 104 people have been killed and more than 6,100 wounded.\n\nThe six days of street protests are the largest challenge yet to the fragile government of Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi.\n\nDemonstrators gathered last week to decry what they described as endemic corruption. But by Sunday, it was a revolt against the entire system.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had enough \u2014 enough!\u201d shouted one young man in Baghdad, bent double and heaving as he ran from a volley of tear gas. \u201cThey stole our futures, and now they\u2019re killing us.\u201d\n\nWith the Internet suspended, Iraq\u2019s television screens are now the stage for a frantic tug of war, as authorities project normalcy and protesters vent their rage.\n\nState media shows taxis rolling calmly through Baghdad. Opposition outlets broadcast bullets whistling through angry crowds.\n\n[Iraqi security forces open fire on anti-government protesters as top cleric backs demands]\n\nIn a cabinet meeting late Saturday, Abdul Mahdi announced a 17-point recovery plan that his government hopes might calm the people. Construction of more housing units and stipends for the unemployed were raised, as well as compensation for families of young men killed during the demonstrations.\n\nBut Sunday evening, protesters gathered again in Baghdad. Demonstrators said security forces continued to use tear gas and live ammunition. Police and gunmen have raided several news outlets that have broadcast footage from the protests.\n\n\u201cThis must stop,\u201d said Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, the top U.N. official in Iraq. She called for those behind the violence to be held responsible.\n\nAbdul Mahdi came to power last year as a consensus candidate promising reform, but he has achieved little in a fractured political environment. His government has tried to calm the streets, but it has had limited impact.\n\nAt a charged meeting Saturday, parliament Speaker Mohammed al-Halbousi told protest leaders their \u201cvoice was being heard.\u201d But it remained unclear who or what could address the grievances that exploded in the largely spontaneous demonstrations that appear to have formed without the instigation of powerful politicians or clerics.\n\n\u201cThese speeches are meant as anesthesia for the people. They\u2019re trying to calm us down,\u201d said 37-year-old Ali Mohammed. \u201cThey have to realize this isn\u2019t like before. If they don\u2019t make changes, things are going to get worse.\u201d\n\n[Iraq is under curfew and Internet blackout as government tries to curb protests]\n\nIn Baghdad, the protesters are mostly young men who say they\u2019ve grown up without a future. Born around the U.S.-led invasion in Iraq, their childhoods battered by war, in adulthood, they have been shut out of a job market that favors those with political connections.\n\nTwo years after the Islamic State was officially defeated in Iraq, many of the country\u2019s nearly 14 million people live in worsening conditions, despite record oil output. Protesters have also rallied against Iranian influence in Iraqi politics.\n\nSecurity forces clashed with demonstrators late into Saturday night, firing tear gas and bullets into crowds that held their ground. Young men covered their faces to protect themselves from the stinging fumes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not leaving!\u201d shouted one. \u201cLook what they\u2019re doing to us!\u201d\n\nAngry chants were lost amid the screech of ambulance sirens. Doctors in nearby hospitals said they\u2019ve been overwhelmed. Some people have been shot. One protester had tire marks across his chest. His friends said he had been hit by a military vehicle.\n\n[Hundreds wounded in Iraq as police fire tear gas, bullets at protesters]\n\nAmbulance crews worked through the night as doctors treated people in the streets. At one point, a convoy of ambulances was forced to turn back without patients after tear gas landed where medics worked. Gunmen shot at the vehicles as they fled.\n\nDemonstrators in the southern cities of Diwaniyah and Nasiriyah set fire to government buildings. Security forces have arrested protesters in their hospital beds.\n\nInfluential cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, whose party controls the largest bloc in parliament, has demanded the government\u2019s resignation and called for early elections. Iraqi and Western officials said support for a snap election is growing, but there were few obvious candidates to step into a vacuum left by Abdul Mahdi, and powerful interests could still stymie reform.\n\n\u201cThe protesters have to be smart here and demand a timeline for change,\u201d said Sabah Zangana, an Iraqi analyst. \u201cOtherwise, these promises will be nothing more than a temporary fix.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAs tensions boil in the Persian Gulf, Iraq seeks to rein in Iran-aligned militias\n\nSyria and Iraq open a key border crossing closed since 2012\n\nDozens of Shiite pilgrims killed in Iraq stampede\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Anti-government demonstrators returned to the streets, while over 100 have died and 6,100 have been injured in six days of unrest.", "authors": ["Louisa Loveluck", "Reporter In The Washington Post'S Beirut Bureau", "Focusing On Syria.", "Mustafa Salim", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2i-Grt49b3Rc7EoWhhWUJA0vjR0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ERZFK7HIKUI6TEYGI7FQGJH5IQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
