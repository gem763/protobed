Trump: \u201cWe're living in a frightening time... Unfortunately we have somebody who I feel doesn't have a grasp of the deep meaning of what it means to be an American.\u201d\n\n\n\nMore from @GayleKing's interview Friday: https://t.co/Nmr49hIKWW pic.twitter.com/kxpcUlnMYu \u2014 CBS This Morning (@CBSThisMorning) October 24, 2019\n\n\u201cSo he\u2019s going back to 2016. And this is now 2019,\u201d King said. \u201cYou surprised that he\u2019s trash-talking you after all this time?\u201d\n\nSpringsteen laughed.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNot really,\u201d he said. \u201cAnything\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d King said. \u201cI mean, a lot of people are very concerned about the direction of the country.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSpringsteen said: \u201cIt\u2019s just frightening, you know? We\u2019re living in a frightening time. The stewardship of the nation is \u2014 has been thrown away to somebody who doesn\u2019t have a clue as to what that means. \u2026 And, unfortunately, we have somebody who I feel doesn\u2019t have a grasp of the deep meaning of what it means to be an American.\"\n\nThe rock legend\u2019s comments were part of a longer conversation promoting his new film \u201cWestern Stars,\u201d which opens in theaters Friday and is based on his recent album of the same name.\n\nAD\n\nFor decades, Springsteen\u2019s music has been the soundtrack of the working class and is often played at campaign rallies. Springsteen has appeared at rallies himself for Democratic candidates but has said in interviews that he is careful not to over-involve himself in politics. He told Variety he tended to be \u201ca little bit ambivalent\u201d about getting directly involved in political campaigns.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done it when I felt it was really necessary and that maybe my two cents might make some small bit of difference,\u201d Springsteen said. \u201cBut the more you do it, your two cents becomes one cent and then no cents whatsoever, so I think your credibility and your impact lessens the more you do it. So I\u2019ve been hesitant to overplay my hand in that area, and I generally come to service when I feel it\u2019s kind of necessary and it might help a little bit.\u201d\n\nBut the Boss has not been shy to criticize Trump since before he won the presidency.\n\nAD\n\nIn October 2016, Springsteen spoke to Rolling Stone about Trump:\n\nThe republic is under siege by a moron, basically. The whole thing is tragic. Without overstating it, it\u2019s a tragedy for our democracy. When you start talking about elections being rigged, you\u2019re pushing people beyond democratic governance. And it\u2019s a very, very dangerous thing to do. Once you let those genies out of the bottle, they don\u2019t go back in so easy, if they go back in at all. The ideas he\u2019s moving to the mainstream are all very dangerous ideas \u2014 white nationalism and the alt-right movement. The outrageous things that he\u2019s done \u2014 not immediately disavowing David Duke? These are things that are obviously beyond the pale for any previous political candidate. It would sink your candidacy immediately. Springsteen to Rolling Stone\n\nLast year, ahead of the release of the Netflix special on his Tony Award-winning Broadway show, Springsteen accused Trump of being \u201cdeeply damaged\u201d and \u201cdangerous.\u201d\n\nTrump \u201chas no interest in uniting the country, really, and actually has an interest in doing the opposite and dividing us, which he does on an almost daily basis,\u201d Springsteen told Esquire magazine. \u201cSo that\u2019s simply a crime against humanity, as far as I\u2019m concerned. It\u2019s an awful, awful message to send out into the world if you\u2019re in that job and in that position. It\u2019s just an ugly, awful message.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSpringsteen said Trump was an example of someone who had abandoned the principles of family, community and citizenship.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t forsake those things. It\u2019ll rot your core at the end of the day,\u201d Springsteen said. \u201cIf you want to see someone who\u2019s \u2014 look at Trump. He has forsaken a lot of these things, and it\u2019s affected him. He\u2019s deeply damaged at his core.\u201d\n\nSpringsteen added: \u201cThat\u2019s why he\u2019s dangerous. Anyone in that position who doesn\u2019t deeply feel those ties that bind is a dangerous man, and it\u2019s very pitiful.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The music legend's comments came after Trump dissed him at a rally earlier this month.", "authors": ["Katie Mettler", "Reporter Covering Breaking News"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/emlboKiX-oqYXwn4VfpvJdb9FmI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2RB7KOXJGMI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
