Ron Johnson for raising a conspiracy theory that is continuously mentioned on Fox News. \u201cI have no idea why a Fox News conspiracy propaganda stuff is popping up on here. I have no idea, I have no idea why we\u2019re going here,\u201d Todd said.\n\nThe combative exchange started when Todd asked about a Wall Street Journal report that quoted the Wisconsin senator as saying that he \u201cwinced\u201d when the U.S. ambassador to the European Union told him that President Donald Trump had withheld military aid to Ukraine for political reasons. \u201cAt that suggestion, I winced. My reaction was: Oh, God. I don\u2019t want to see those two things combined,\u201d Johnson told the Journal. That aid and the contents of the now infamous July 25 phone call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is part of the House\u2019s ongoing impeachment inquiry.\n\nMore from Rolling Stone\n\nAfter Todd asked the senator, \u201cWhat made you wince?\u201d Johnson went into a full defense of the president while trying to avoid the question about his own words. Johnson\u2019s agenda seemed clear, his appearance on Meet the Press was to muddy the waters by bashing the \u201cbiased\u201d media as he began to read from notes while directing Todd to ask former CIA director John Brennan about a completely off topic conspiracy theory involving former FBI agent Peter Strzok. \u201cWhat does this have to do with Ukraine?\u201d Todd asked.\n\nAs Todd gave the rambling senator time to get back to the question, you could hear the host\u2019s growing frustration when he finally interjected and stated, \u201cI have no idea why a Fox News conspiracy propaganda stuff is popping up on here. I have no idea. I have no idea why we\u2019re going here.\u201d\n\nAs the senator continually spoke over Todd\u2019s attempts to bring the conversation back to reality, the host then raised his voice and said, \u201cSenator Johnson, please! Can we please answer the question that I asked you, instead of trying to make Donald Trump feel better here\u2014that you\u2019re not criticizing him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to ask a simple question of what made you wince?\u201d Todd continued. \u201cI\u2019m asking a simple question about how you clearly were upset [that] there was an implication that military aid was being frozen because the president wanted an investigation. Why did you wince?\u201d\n\nJohnson went on to explain that he is satisfied with the president on the topic because Trump \u201ccompletely denied it. He adamantly denied it. He vehemently, angrily denied it. He said, \u2018I\u2019d never do that.\u2019\u201d\n\nOf late Todd has taken a stronger approach on matters concerning the president\u2019s controversies. On Thursday, the host opened his show and put aside his propensity for going out his way to come across as unbiased and said, \u201cI don\u2019t say this lightly, but let\u2019s be frank. A national nightmare is upon us. The basic rules of our democracy are under attack, from the president.\u201d\n\nChuck Todd: \"Let's be frank: a national nightmare is upon us.
