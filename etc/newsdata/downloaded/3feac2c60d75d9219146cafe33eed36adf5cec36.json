It must have been viewed billions of times.\n\n'What's interesting is it's one of the most iconic images of all time and it has been holding this detail which I've managed to reveal.\n\nBuzz Aldrin flew to the Moon in 1969 as part of the Apollo 11 space mission, posing for a photograph next to the US flag\n\nAldrin's reflective visor on his spacesuit had initially made it virtually impossible to view his face\n\n'Although I'm the first to do it, it's really not that technical. I just use photo-processing equipment and dedication.\n\n'I alter the contrast, reduce the sound and edit the highlights on the countless amount of layers.\n\n'I use what is called dodging and burning. It essentially makes the lighter bit light and the darker bits dark.\n\n'I was able to faintly make out the microphone across his face and from there I was able to spot his eyes.\n\n'Then I work with a collection of pixels at a time to expose what is underneath.\n\n'But nothing is copied into the photo. All the data is already there. I just enhance that. This one took me hours to do.'\n\nEarlier this year Andy applied the same techniques to a photos of Neil Armstrong stepping off Apollo 11 in Nasa video footage. It took him several days.\n\nOnce the outline of Aldrin's facial features became slightly clearer, Andy, a property developer from Culcheth, Cheshire, spent hours tweaking the saturation and contrast of tiny areas at a time\n\nAndy added: 'They're such famous photographs and to be able to see both their faces on the 50th anniversary is really quite something.\n\n'Now you're able to see the pair of them in space. It completes the Apollo 11 \"set\".'\n\nDr Robert Massey of the Royal Astronomical Society said: 'There's not many photos of astronauts' faces in space.\n\n'You often see pictures of reflective visors so to see a human face beneath reminds us people had actually made it onto the moon rather than robot props.\n\n'We are looking to going back to the moon in the 2020s.\n\n'It's quite refreshing to see the human journey told through pictures in the 1960s.'\n\nThe Apollo 11 crew photo showing astronauts Neil Armstong (left), Micahel Collins (middle) and Buzz Aldrin (right)", "description": "Andy Saunders, 45,\u00a0from Culcheth, Cheshire, brightened and darkened the shades of the photo, often a few pixels at a time, to slowly reveal a face beneath the hazy helmet glass.", "authors": ["Jack Elsom For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/12/19250294-0-image-a-13_1570102790718.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
