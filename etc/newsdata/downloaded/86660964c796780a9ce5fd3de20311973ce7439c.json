Some of the songs mentioned in the lawsuit subsequently vanished, to the dismay of users.\n\nNow the NMPA has filed an amended suit after claiming it found a further 1,200 infringing songs \u2014 upping the damages sought to $300 million, double the original figure of $150 million. Songs by Taylor Swift and Adele were among those added to the list, Forbes reported.\n\nThe NMPA told the Verge these songs were uncovered through legal discovery, and in a statement focused on classics by Ray Charles and The Beatles: \"Newly discovered works include some of the most famous and popular songs ever recorded, such as \"Georgia On My Mind,\" \"I Can See For Miles\" and \"I Saw Her Standing There,\" a spokesman said.\n\nRead more: Peloton, the fitness startup with a cultlike following, could go public at an $8 billion valuation. Insiders reveal why its business seems set to explode.\n\nThe amended lawsuit comes just ahead of Peloton's planned IPO. After the initial suit was filed Peloton launched a countersuit accusing the NMPA of anticompetitive behavior, instigating a \"coordinated effort\" among its members to \"fix prices and to engage in a concerted refusal to deal with Peloton.\"\n\nPeloton reiterated this position following this amended suit in a statement to the Hollywood Reporter: \"NMPA has again revealed its anti-competitive objective in this matter. In March, NMPA requested an expedited trial schedule, to which Peloton readily agreed. On the eve of court-ordered mediation, NMPA sought to alter the optics around its lawsuit by filing exaggerated new claims prior to the mediation while also transparently timing its filing to capitalize on Peloton's inability to publicly respond in detail during our quiet period.\"\n\nPeloton was not immediately available for comment when contacted by Business Insider.
