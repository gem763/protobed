I turned 58. I have a 40-year work history and a bachelor of science with a double major in physics and chemistry, plus a string of other qualifications. I even have a forklift licence, and used to run the quality testing lab at the factory where I worked for eight years before it closed in 2012.\n\nAccording to my Jobactive provider, none of it happened. All they see is my age.\n\nWhen I became unemployed it was unexpected, and despite my confidence I struggled. Everywhere I applied said I was too qualified and they\u2019d have to pay me too much. When I started going to these providers, my 20-something caseworker suggested I should simply delete my qualifications from my resume.\n\nAnd just like that, at the push of a button, my whole working life was erased.\n\nAfterwards they started shunting me into jobs for which I was unsuited. They made me take cleaning jobs, even though I had arthritis. Once a caseworker asked me whether I had any retail experience. In 40 years I had not worked a day in retail but she said she had found the job for me and moved the screen around so I could see it. It was a job in sales. Up the top it said in big, bold letters that applicants must have a minimum of five years\u2019 retail experience. She even bought me interview clothes that didn\u2019t fit.\n\nIf I didn\u2019t go to the interview my payments would have been cut, so I went along anyway in my clothes that didn\u2019t fit to explain why I was applying for a job I was entirely unqualified for.\n\nI keep getting into trouble because I won\u2019t use their version of my resume. They say I\u2019m not allowed to and that I have to show proof of my qualifications. So I take in my university degree \u2013 I\u2019ve got it framed \u2013 I take the whole thing in there and say, \u201cLook, this is my university degree and my forklift licence,\u201d and they still don\u2019t put it on to the system.\n\nAnd then at the next appointment I\u2019ll have another new 20-year-old caseworker who I have to explain myself to once more because there\u2019s nothing on the system. When I finish she says she doesn\u2019t believe me and threatens to cut off my payments if I don\u2019t do what she says.\n\nThat\u2019s it. You\u2019re treated like a child by a child in an infinite loop, constantly afraid they\u2019ll cut off your payments again and you\u2019ll fall behind on your bills.\n\nAnonymous, 49, Perth\n\nOnce you\u2019re in the system you\u2019re completely at the mercy of any person who is incompetent or has a grudge. You cope with gallows humour. Dealing with the Jobactive provider reminds me of those old Asterix comics where the Gauls had to navigate their way around the Roman bureaucracy. They\u2019d go up to one window and be told, no, you have to go to Room 1. At Room 1, they\u2019d be told they actually had to go to Room 2.\n\nI\u2019ve been cut off Centrelink so many times I\u2019ve lost count. It\u2019s mostly because of the soaring incompetence of the people running the system. If they don\u2019t want to deal with you, or a person with an attitude decides you\u2019re a \u201cnon-compliant person\u201d, they send you to Centrelink out of spite.\n\nThe last time I was cut off, I was sent to do a Work for the Dole activity at a place ironically called \u201cPeople Who Care\u201d. We were doing busywork. It was terribly run. Twice they lost my paperwork but instead of losing my shit I politely asked whether they might take a look in their desk drawer.\n\nSo later you get a text \u2013 they send you this text message to say you have been cut off because you haven\u2019t attended your work appointment. But I had. It turned out they had two separate managers on each day who hadn\u2019t bothered to do the paperwork. Apparently everyone who was there on those two days got cut off.\n\nThis is pretty normal. Other people I know will get cut off if they\u2019re five minutes late to call their Jobactive provider. I\u2019ve been cut off because I\u2019ve called at the right time and the phone has been busy so it goes to message bank. Five minutes later I\u2019ll get a text message saying \u201cYou\u2019ve been cut off because you haven\u2019t reported in.\u201d So you call them back and then you get admonished because you didn\u2019t call at the correct time. Or they say they were on the phone.\n\nSo then I ask: \u201cIf you knew I was going to call, why were you on the phone?\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t blame them though. All the people working in these places are just poor assholes who are just stuck in the same system. The person sitting on the other side of the desk from me in these places, that person could be me. They could end up on the side of the desk that I\u2019m sitting on. And that\u2019s what they\u2019re scared of.\n\nAnonymous, 32, South Australia\n\nMy strange experience with a Jobactive provider happened back in November 2015. It was a week of pure, concentrated weirdness.\n\nThe provider found me a job with a charity. They handled everything. My case manager even took the picture for the photo ID.\n\nThere was a man who handled what limited training there was by phone. The day after, I had a trial shift. I had to collect money door-to-door with no information about what the charity actually did, who ran it or what the money we were raising was for \u2013 only that it was for children in the Philippines.\n\nThe leaflets they gave us to hand out were about cancer, copied and pasted from Wikipedia, even though the charity was supposedly about education. When I spoke to people I couldn\u2019t even answer basic questions. And people were still generous. A blind man gave me $20. It was absurd and awful.\n\nWhen I asked my point of contact questions, he grew frustrated and aggressive with me. He told me to look on the website but it was just pictures of kids with vague descriptions; no programs, no initiatives. It\u2019s been taken down since, but the mission statement was just a copy of the tax definition of a charity.\n\nI looked up as much as I could about the company. I found the names associated with it had run similar charities that had been exposed as frauds by the ABC. These names weren\u2019t on the website or any training materials. [This charity] didn\u2019t have anything a normal charity had.\n\nI didn\u2019t know what to do, so I reported this to the ACCC and even made a police report. When I told my caseworker, they tried to make me keep doing the job. They told me they\u2019d had their office look it up and that the charity was properly registered, but anyone can register for a business name. I read charities have a year before they\u2019re audited.\n\nWhen my questions about how the collected money was spent still weren\u2019t answered, the case manager called my point of contact. That\u2019s when they agreed that something wasn\u2019t right and that I didn\u2019t have to do it any more. They joked nervously about ending up on A Current Affair.\n\nA few weeks later I had another appointment and my case manager casually mentioned that another client was still collecting money for [the charity]. She knew they were shonky and still nothing had been done.\n\nTodd Taranto, 27, West Gippsland\n\nEverything, I should say, started out fine. I\u2019m on the disability support pension, so when I was placed with the Jobactive provider I found the people there lovely and I was actually hopeful I may get a job. But I live in West Gippsland and there isn\u2019t much work here. I had no bites or anything.\n\nSo six months in the Jobactive people started enrolling me in these mini job classes. They include things like interview prep, the different qualifications needed for a job, and were basically pointless. They were there to make it look like we were doing something. I was there two or three times a week to keep me occupied. And I did that for six weeks.\n\nAt that time the case managers I dealt with kept changing as the company restructured. I went through three of them and eventually ended up with a disability consultant who suggested I look at doing a Certificate V in business and retail. It was supposed to be six months of doing two hours a week online.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Todd Taranto speaks to The Guardian about his personal experience with Centrelink. Photograph: Christopher Hopkins/The Guardian\n\nI agreed because it was better than jumping through their other hoops. I already had a bachelor in communications and an advanced diploma in business studies, so I thought this might be another qualification to add to my CV. But after the first few units, I realised I had already held a higher level qualification in the same area, so I already knew everything. When I later went through a period of unwellness, they allowed me to take a week or two off and I spoke to the consultant off-the-cuff. That\u2019s when she said she wouldn\u2019t have recommended I do the course. They basically let me waste my time for about six months.\n\nThen, at the end of 2018, I had a letter from Centrelink saying that it was worse than that: I wasn\u2019t required to attend appointments with a Jobactive provider at all. I didn\u2019t believe it at first, but then someone from Centrelink rang me to explain I was officially considered a \u201cvolunteer\u201d. They said I could continue going to appointments and looking for work if I wanted to, but then I\u2019d have to sign a contract which would lock me in.\n\nI thought something was wrong or there had been a mistake. The next time I went into the provider and spoke to my consultant, I told her about the phone call. We laughed about it because we agreed Centrelink must have made a mistake. Of course I was supposed to be here. I\u2019d been going to appointments for nearly two years.\n\nAbout a minute or two, she stopped, looked something up on her computer and told me Centrelink actually had it right: I didn\u2019t need to be there at all. I\u2019d spent two years of my life jumping through hoops for no reason.\n\nAnonymous, 27, South Australia\n\nI recently went for a pre-interview phone call at a Jobactive provider where I had to explain I worked for five years managing Work for the Dole before quitting. A series of unrelated life events forced a mental health crisis and a hospitalisation. Now I\u2019m on Newstart to supplement my income while I start a business. It\u2019s hard and embarrassing, especially as I know just how powerless you are as a job seeker.\n\nThe whole system is broken, on both ends. I have so many stories from when I managed the Work for the Dole program. One that really affected me involved a client who was sent to work at a golf club. While on the job, he fell off some scaffolding that wasn\u2019t set up correctly and landed on his face. He had to be hospitalised and the breakages caused him breathing difficulties and disfiguration. That was really horrible and I took that guilt home with me after realising there was no support for him.\n\nI think Work for the Dole is like slave labour. There was no food provided for those doing the activities and people had to bring their own lunch. The subsidy for getting to the activity was an extra $20.80 a fortnight. To my knowledge this hasn\u2019t changed since 1997. You\u2019re essentially getting a bunch of people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds doing work that is often quite degrading. Meanwhile they are working for free for organisations that are making money off them. When I worked there, each individual placement was worth $1,000, or $3,500 for \u201ctraining\u201d activities. That money gets paid by the government to the organisation.\n\nLooking back on it, my family says that working [as a Work for the Dole manager] in my early 20s made me jaded. There were too many times I had people crying on the phone, saying they didn\u2019t have money for food and I was forced by law to say, \u201cWell, you didn\u2019t meet your mutual obligation, we have to notify Centrelink.\u201d Even if you go in wanting to help people, the system doesn\u2019t let you. Over time, one of two things happen: you either harden your heart and become a robot, or you take your work home with you and have a breakdown.\n\nAnonymous, 29, Northern Territory\n\nLast year Centrelink put me on the ParentsNext program. Dealing with them has been really frustrating as I\u2019m not supposed to be on this program. I\u2019m a mother of two children and I was studying and working when they put me on it.\n\nAt first I thought I would go in and report to them and that was it. The lady I was going through at the Jobactive provider made my appointments once every two months at the start. Then about two or three weeks ago, I had a new consultant who said I shouldn\u2019t be on that program at all. They said I was working too much. Someone at Centrelink though decided I didn\u2019t have a job, even though I\u2019ve been working at the same organisation for the past two years for pay. That\u2019s when Centrelink wanted to make me start looking for 10 jobs a week.\n\nAfter that, Centrelink started bringing me in for appointments with my Jobactive provider more often. During the middle of a work day, I would have to tell my boss, \u201cSorry, but I have to leave to go to these appointments.\u201d My boss was supportive and wrote me a letter to try to help, which I showed the Jobactive people, but it didn\u2019t change anything.\n\nWhen I spoke to someone from Centrelink about it over the phone, they said the rules meant I had to look for 10 jobs. When I told them I wouldn\u2019t, they said I had to. I said to them: \u201cYou don\u2019t own me. I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m my own person.\u201d\n\nThe case manager I deal with at the Jobactive is good though and can see I shouldn\u2019t be there, so she\u2019s started calling me via the phone so I don\u2019t have to go in. I\u2019m trying to get off ParentsNext now but Centrelink won\u2019t let me leave. Last week I was told to provide 13 weeks of payslips to exit the ParentsNext program. More paperwork.\n\nIt\u2019s like when I talk, they don\u2019t listen.\n\nThe unnamed contributors to this story are known to the journalist and asked to remain anonymous", "description": "Six people recount their interactions with Centrelink and the government\u2019s welfare programs, which range from absurd to frustrating to insulting", "authors": ["Royce Kurmelovs"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76631a333413903699966944d9c151824861dbbd/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8ad78a1aee6ffe19e71e102f4ced7176", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
