And the researchers behind the study believe it shines a much-needed light on under-studied differences in suicidal attempts and ideation (basically, thoughts) among American teens based on race and ethnicity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to look at trends in suicide behavior expression, because it gives us a sense of whether there are particular risk groups \u2014 and then how we can begin to think about the needs of those different groups,\u201d said lead author Michael A. Lindsey, executive director of the McSilver Institute for Poverty Policy and Research at the NYU Silver School of Social Work.\n\ndigitalskillet via Getty Images\n\nHuffPost Parents chatted with Lindsey about his new research, and about what concerned parents need to know.\n\nFirst and foremost, what are the main findings here that you think people really need to know about?\n\nWe looked at four \u201cindices\u201d of suicidal behavior: ideation, plans, attempts and injury by attempt. And attempts is where there is real cause for concern. We found that every racial and ethnic group had a decrease in attempts over that span of time, except for one group, and that was Black adolescents. Over that span of time, their attempts have gone up \u2014 both males and females. And injury by attempt has gone down for other groups, but has gone up by Black adolescent males. That means the method of attempt that led to serious harm was potentially lethal.\n\nHow can it be that suicidal ideation was down in your study, but actual attempts by Black teenagers increased? Can you explain that a bit?\n\nWhen you have ideation and plans going down, but attempts increasing, that suggests there may be some impulsivity to it for Black kids. Like, they\u2019re going straight to attempts.\n\n\u201cWe need to do a better job of understanding the signs of suicidality. What does it look like in black teens?\u201d - Michael A. Lindsey, NYU Silver School of Social Work\n\nBut it could also mean that for Black teens, we need to do a better job of understanding the signs of suicidality. What does it look like in Black teens?\n\nI think the importance of this study is that it is calling out, in a very demonstrative way, that the way Black kids express their suicidal symptoms may be different. And we need to understand how and why.\n\nI think the big question for so many readers and parents will obviously be what is behind this increase in Black teens. Obviously, that\u2019s a bigger question than you can answer in one study, but what are some of the theories?\n\nI think factors such as racism, higher rates of poverty and higher rates of adverse childhood events could be at play. But it has also been well-documented that Black youth have less access to mental health treatment. That could have to do, in part, with not wanting to be seen as weak. Stigma is definitely at play. There\u2019s also mistrust of treatment providers, and Black youth might prefer to address their emotional and psychological pain within their families or their peer group.\n\nWe also know that there need to be more mental health counselors in schools. Oftentimes, we find in Black and brown communities (particularly low-income or low-resource) that schools have to share a clinician, or that clinician may only be available one day a week.\n\nYou\u2019ve been doing this research for a while. Are we at least getting better at paying attention to some of these differences and issues?\n\nI think there\u2019s a lack of awareness, to be quite frank.\n\nA lot of what you\u2019re talking about requires big, systemwide change. That can leave parents feeling helpless. What can they do?\n\nWell first, we need to raise greater awareness of the signs of depression in Black youth, and how they may be nuanced. Black youth often presents depression through physical complaints and interpersonal challenges. A kid may say, \u201cI have a headache\u201d and consistently complain about it. Or it may be a stomach ache. Those are warning signs we should pay particular attention to.\n\n\u201cThe kid who is depressed may not be the kid in the back of the class with their head down; it may be the kid who is irritable when you try and engage them, or explosive. They may fight. Those kids tend to be suspended from school, particularly Black kids.\u201d - Michael A. Lindsey, NYU Silver School of Social Work\n\nIrritability is another big one. For example, I\u2019ll often tell school personnel that the kid who is depressed may not be the kid in the back of the class with their head down; it may be the kid who is irritable when you try and engage them, or even explosive. They may fight. And those kids tend to be suspended from school, particularly Black kids. So I say to school personnel, before you suspend that kid for fighting or cursing the teacher out, why don\u2019t you step back and explore what\u2019s going on in their lives? I bet when you do that, you\u2019ll get at the core of the issue, which then turns into a treatable problem through mental health. The same goes for parents.\n\nIn other words, don\u2019t necessarily expect that a depressed teenager is going to show that through really obvious sadness.\n\nI think parents should be focused on checking in with their kids, daily. We know that social media is really present in a lot of kids lives, so checking in with them about the kinds of experiences they\u2019re having there is also important.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s about checking in with them. And being involved, actively, in their lives.\n\nThis conversation has been edited and condensed.", "description": "Here's what parents and caregivers need to know.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da0cc622100005009acd0e5.jpeg?cache=b7voCf1QSx&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
