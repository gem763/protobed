It marks the first move in a comprehensive political process that has only been held three other times in U.S. history.\n\n\n\nMore: Frank Lloyd Wright\u2019s Last Home Goes up For Auction\n\n\u201cThe real estate market is dependent on factors that have to do with the economy, consumer confidence and the stock market,\u201d Donna Olshan, president of Olshan Realty, who closely tracks the luxury market in her weekly reports on New York City\u2019s high-end real estate. \u201cIf any one of those things goes down for a sustained period, it will affect us, but right now stocks are up. Wall Street is finding this is a non-event.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt market close on Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 162.94 points.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe stock market is able to shake off the daily Trump machinations,\u201d Ms. Olshan said. \u201cPeople don't get as panicked.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe latest news is just the most recent in a presidency that has been rife with tension and negative headlines.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot over the last year,\u201d said Jonathan Miller, chief executive of real estate appraisal firm Miller Samuel and author of several Douglas Elliman market reports focusing on cities and towns around the U.S.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a continuing narrative of uncertainty,\u201d Mr. Miller said, and \u201cright now there's nothing to suggest [impeachment] is providing additional uncertainty.\u201d Nor will it be shocking people into changing their behavior, he said.\n\n\n\nThe proceedings are unlikely to change how the majority of people across the U.S. approach their real estate acquisitions or sales, according to Redfin lead economist Taylor Marr.\n\n\n\n\u201cPeople are going to move based on life changes: having kids, marriages, retiring. Those are the drivers,\u201d Mr. Marr told Mansion Global. \u201cMost evidence that we can look at for how things like this have an effect on the market show it's usually pretty small, if any.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Australian Billionaire Andrew Forrest Aims to End Plastic Pollution\n\nAcross the pond, the U.K.\u2019s still-undecided exit from the European Union demonstrates that substantial political uncertainty and upheaval can have a drastic effect on real estate markets, but in this case, the disruption is far from substantial enough to have the same implications, experts say.\n\n\n\n\u201cSomething like Brexit is a structural shift, an economic wedge being driven between the U.K. and Europe,\u201d said Paul Habibi, continuing lecturer of finance and real estate at UCLA Anderson Graduate School of Management. But \u201cthe removal of a president doesn't mean a structural shift,\u201d and is more simply just part of the cyclical ebbs and flows of the market, he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy eye is more on the potential for a Chinese trade war,\u201d he said, referring to ongoing economic conflict between the U.S. and China. \u201cSome of these things are bigger potential issues than the impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\n\n\nIf House members determine there is enough evidence against Mr. Trump following the inquiry, the body must vote on articles of impeachment, which is a set of charges against the president.\n\n\n\nOnly two presidents have been impeached in U.S. history, President Andrew Johnson in 1868 and President Bill Clinton in 1998. President Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 following the initiation of the impeachment process but before actual impeachment.\n\n\n\nNo president has been removed from office as a result of the impeachment proceedings, and it\u2019s highly unlikely that the majority Republican Senate would vote to remove Mr. Trump if it were to advance to that chamber.\n\n\n\nEven in the event that he does get removed from office, there still won\u2019t be a drastic effect on the real estate market, Mr. Habibi said, as Vice President Mike Pence would take over and there would be no change in policy.\n\n\n\nIn regards to the next step to Tuesday\u2019s announced proceedings, six House committees are now expected to compile evidence on impeachable offenses by President Trump and send their cases against him to the Judiciary Committee.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Liz Lucking"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-111020?size=1.5041128084606346&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
