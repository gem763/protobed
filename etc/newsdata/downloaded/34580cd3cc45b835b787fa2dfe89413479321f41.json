Going in, the key question was how former Vice President Joe Biden, the moderate front-runner, would stand up to his two leading contenders, the considerably more liberal Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.\n\nAnswer: Mr. Biden emerged in decent shape, and even got a little bit of support from others.\n\nMr. Biden clearly sought to be more aggressive and energetic than in the first two debates, and to challenge his progressive rivals before they challenged him. He did that, above all, by bluntly questioning the cost of the Sanders/Warren plans for a government-run, Medicare-for-All health program.\n\nHe got support from the flanks, from Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar \u2014also more assertive this time\u2014and from South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Both joined the skepticism about the progressives\u2019 health agenda.\n\nMr. Biden still made some typical detours into the verbal thickets as the night wore on, but without doing serious damage. So the overall shape of the race probably didn\u2019t change, though Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Buttigieg, as well as New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, gave themselves a chance to fight into the top tier.\n\nSo too did former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, whose campaign increasingly focuses on gun issues in the wake of a mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso. He pushed hard on his arguments for more gun control, including calling for, essentially, confiscation of assault rifles. That is an aggressive position that will please much of the Democratic base\u2014though, ironically, may be hard to sell in his home state of Texas, where some still hope he will run for Senate instead of president.\n\nThe gun issue also illustrates the next phase of the race: In the next week, the congressional agenda will begin intruding on the presidential campaign in a much bigger way. Democrats in the House and Republicans in the Senate will begin wrestling over the emotional question of whether to advance gun legislation.\n\nMeantime, House Democrats continue to struggle with the treacherous question of whether to wade fully into impeachment proceedings against President Trump. Impeachment wasn\u2019t even mentioned Thursday night, but the candidates won\u2019t be able to avoid the topic for long.\n\nWrite to Gerald F.
