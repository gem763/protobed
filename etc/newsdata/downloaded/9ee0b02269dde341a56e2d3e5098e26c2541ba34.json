Africa Pulse postulates that \u201c50 million more people could be lifted out of poverty by 2030 if the incomes of the poor were to grow 2 percentage points faster annually\u201d.\n\nAccording to the report, the failure of GDP growth into income growth has resulted in Africa\u2019s rate of poverty reduction being slower than in other regions despite robust economic expansion over the past 25 years. It suggests \u201ca poverty reduction strategy with a jobs lens\u201d in which an environment is created to produce \u201cgood jobs\u201d that raise the incomes of the poor. These will necessarily be in sectors that are intensive in the use of labour and land \u2013 \u201cthe assets of the poor\u201d, as the report calls them.\n\n\u201cThe key principle of engagement to accelerate poverty reduction is that interventions should be designed so that the poor benefit as directly as possible, enabling them to be in the driver\u2019s seat of their wellbeing,\u201d the report says.\n\nAnother immediate action punted by the World Bank document is integrating interventions so that they complement each other. For instance, youth skills training must be aligned with demand for it; agricultural machinery subsidisation must be aligned with maintenance and repair services and irrigation infrastructure must be accompanied by the presence of proper water maintenance systems.\n\nNoting that the spread of digital technologies and solar power is providing new opportunities for the continent\u2019s people, the report proposes that these be seized on to \u201cleapfrog\u201d over the lack of developed infrastructure on the ground; in communications with markets and boosting productivity. \u201cThe poor can benefit from these leapfrogging technologies directly, as adopters, through greater access to productivity-enhancing capital goods.\u201d\n\nThe report shows the World Bank had cut its economic growth forecast for sub-Saharan Africa for this year to 2021 by 0.2 percentage points from its earlier projection, citing a slowdown in fixed investment and policy uncertainty in the global economy.\n\nThe bank said the region\u2019s economy was expected to grow 2.6% this year, from a 2.8% projection in April. It said growth would rise to 3.1% next year and 3.2% in 2021.\n\n\u201cDespite some improvements, the external environment is expected to remain difficult and uncertain for the region,\u201d the bank said in this month\u2019s Africa\u2019s Pulse report.\n\nChina and the US, the world\u2019s leading economies, this year imposed new tit-for-tat tariffs on each other\u2019s goods as part of a long-running dispute over Beijing\u2019s trading practices, which Washington says are unfair.\n\nThose tensions, plus the softening global growth and falling commodity prices, compounded by the slow pace of reforms in African countries, \u201care weighing on activity across the region\u201d, the bank said.\n\nOn the continent, drought, security threats, increases in the cost of public borrowing and private investment were also slowing growth. Nigeria, South Africa and Angola, which make up about 60% of sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s annual economic output, were all facing various impediments, the bank said.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s economy would expand 0.8% this year, from a 1.3% forecast in April, and growth would rise to 1.0% next year from the World Bank\u2019s April forecast of 1.7%, it said.\n\nThe bank said it made the cuts in its forecasts for South Africa due to the sharp slowdown in GDP growth in the first quarter of this year, low investor sentiment and persistent policy uncertainty, including whether a solution could be found for state power firm Eskom.\n\nThe bank said Angola\u2019s economy would grow 0.7% this year, from a World Bank projection of 1.0% in April.\n\nThe rest of sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 excluding Nigeria, South Africa and Angola \u2013 is expected to grow 4.0% this year from the bank\u2019s 4.4% projection in April, and 4.7% next year and 4.8% in 2021 in line with its April forecasts.\n\nThe bank said the proportion of African countries determined to be in debt distress or in high risk of external debt distress had doubled, but the pace of deterioration had reduced. \u2013 Additional reporting by Reuters", "description": "If Africa is to overcome structural poverty those involved in policymaking and implementation should focus on pro-poor growth that directly expands the incomes of the impoverished.", "authors": ["Mondli Makhanya"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9096/77ca44864f8f430fad0e15dab7bba013.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
