Such strikes raised concerns about the identification of military objectives and respect for the principles of proportionality and precautions in attack, they say. If there were breaches of the latter, which the experts consider highly likely, they would amount to serious violations of international law.\n\nThe experts also found reasonable grounds to believe that the Houthis were responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law for having launched indiscriminate attacks resulting in the death or injury of civilians and, in some cases, by directing attacks against civilians.\n\nAll parties may also have used starvation as a method of warfare.\n\nThe experts call for the immediate cessation of all acts of violence committed against civilians and urge other states to refrain from providing weapons.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption The third city of Taiz has been besieged by the Houthis since 2015\n\n\"States are obliged to take all reasonable measures to ensure respect for international humanitarian law by other states. Furthermore, the Arms Trade Treaty, to which France and the United Kingdom are parties, prohibits the authorization of arms transfers with the knowledge that these would be used to commit war crimes,\" they note.\n\n\"The legality of arms transfers by France, the United Kingdom, the United States and other states remains questionable, and is the subject of various domestic court proceedings,\" they add.\n\nMelissa Parke, an Australian member of the Group of Experts, told reporters in Geneva: \"It is clear that the continued supply of weapons to parties to the conflict is perpetuating the conflict and prolonging the suffering of the Yemeni people.\"\n\nWhere possible, the experts have identified \"individuals who may be responsible for international crimes\" and submitted a confidential list of their names to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.\n\nThere was no response to the report from the coalition, the Yemeni government or the Houthis. But they have all previously denied carrying out war crimes.\n\nThe UK Foreign Office has not commented on the report. But ministers have said in the past they cannot determine whether any civilian deaths have been the result of British bombs or planes because the coalition does not track their use.\n\nThe US has argued against halting arms sales or assistance to the coalition, saying that continuing them is more likely to help limit civilian casualties.", "description": "The US, UK and France provide arms and logistical support to a Saudi-led coalition fighting there.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/E6F0/production/_108602195_mediaitem108594831.jpg"}
