Vice President Mike Pence came to the state for Mr. Bishop on Monday in Union County, a GOP stronghold. Mr. Trump won the district by 12 percentage points in 2016.\n\nTuesday\u2019s vote was seen as a test of how voters, particularly suburbanites who make up much of the district, view Mr. Trump as the 2020 campaign kicks into gear, people from both political parties said in interviews.\n\nMr. Trump took credit late Tuesday for Mr. Bishop\u2019s success, tweeting that \u201cDan Bishop was down 17 points 3 weeks ago. He then asked me for help, we changed his strategy together, and he ran a great race.\u201d\n\nThe Ninth District stretches from the Charlotte suburbs and neighboring Union County three hours\u2019 drive east through several rural counties. Roughly 60% of registered voters live in the Charlotte suburbs, a rapidly urbanizing area that had long been GOP territory.\n\nThe race was unusually close for a district that has been a Republican stronghold for many years, with analysts saying Mr. Trump was the reason the district was in play in the first place.\n\nDavid Wasserman of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report said it was the rural areas that guaranteed Mr. Bishop\u2019s win, not the suburbs, and tweeted that Mr. Bishop\u2019s narrow margin was \u201cstill bad news for the House GOP overall.\u201d\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Do you think the North Carolina congressional election is telling of how suburban Americans will vote in next year\u2019s presidential election? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n\nPresident Trump gave his support to state Sen. Dan Bishop at a rally in Fayetteville, N.C., on Monday.

She said she didn\u2019t contemplate voting for a Democrat because she opposes the agenda of the progressive wing that seems to be driving the party.\n\nShe said she talks about politics with her closest friends but few others in the wealthy suburbs where she lives, which are rapidly changing with newcomers from other parts of the country. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to talk with people,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not worth it. People get so upset.\u201d\n\nOutside groups spent a near-record amount for a single special election, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Groups such as the national parties\u2019 congressional committees spent $6.8 million to boost the Republican, and about $3.9 million to help the Democrat.\n\nIn the initial election last fall, then-GOP nominee Mark Harris beat Mr. McCready by fewer than 1,000 votes. But state election officials invalidated the results after it emerged that a consultant for Mr. Harris had improperly handled absentee ballots.\n\nWrite to Valerie Bauerlein at valerie.bauerlein@wsj.com", "description": "Voters in a conservative congressional district here picked President Trump ally Republican Dan Bishop in Tuesday\u2019s special election instead of a Democrat who had promised to seek compromise in Washington.", "authors": ["Valerie Bauerlein", "Valerie.Bauerlein Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105994/social", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
