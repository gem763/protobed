Rejecting a Federalist proposal that the question take the form of whether Pickering was \u201cguilty of high crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d they opted for the formulation \u201cguilty as charged\u201d \u2014 a means of \u201ckeeping out of sight the questions of law implied\u201d in the constitutional standard, according to John Quincy Adams.

Stanton. The act stipulated that cabinet members \u201cshall hold their offices respectively for and during the term of the President by whom they may have been appointed and for one month thereafter, subject to removal by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.\u201d Stanton had been appointed by Lincoln; if, as Johnson\u2019s defense counsel would argue, \u201cdeath is a limit,\u201d then Lincoln\u2019s term ended in April 1865 and the act\u2019s protections no longer applied to Stanton.
