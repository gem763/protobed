The sentencing could've been more harsh, considering the crime's time range was, possibly, \"life.\" People are livid regarding Amber's sentence. During a post-courtroom reaction, residents and friends expressed the sentence as a \"slap in the face.\" Seriously, there are people serving more time for drug possession and distribution than Amber Guyger is getting for murdering Botham Jean.\n\nWas his life only worth 10 years?\n\nAmber Guyger, 31, was at the mercy of a diverse jury and an overly compassionate judge (Tammy Kemp) on October 2. As seen in the video below, Judge Kemp even offered a hug to Guyger. \"Where they do that at?\"\n\nAfter several emotional testimonies from Botham Jean's family, things were starting to look a little lenient on Guyger's behalf. Amber Guyger \u2014 in her many tears and apologetic expressions \u2014 even had the victim's younger brother giving her hugs in the courtroom, according to Dallas Morning News.\n\nYet, when her racist, offensive text messages, and social media posts were revealed, it was pretty much a done deal for Amber. Although Amber Guyger only received 10 years, the prosecution asked jurors for 28 years, minimum \u2014 given the fact that Botham Jean would've turned 28 years of age on last Sunday.\n\nAmber Guyger can appeal her sentence\n\nThis is a luxury many murderers \u2014 especially black ones \u2014 don't immediately receive.\n\nAccording to NBC News, Amber didn't testify during her sentencing. Yet, the kink in the sentence is that Amber Guyger could've been given only two years in prison. NBC News mentioned the jury was asked to consider the possibility that Botham Jean's murder was committed out of \"sudden passion.\" This implies that Guyger simply reacted (in the heat of the moment). I'll tell you one thing. It's definitely interesting how many scapegoats they attempted throwing at the jurors.\n\nRegarding Amber Guyger's sentence, defense also asked jurors to consider the \"castle doctrine,\" which sets the premise that \"your home is your castle.\" With this in mind, if the jury would've fell for such buffoonery, Amber could've gotten away with murder. She claimed to have thought she was in her home and was simply defending it.\n\nBe serious for a moment. If you walked into a home that's decorated completely different than yours \u2014 including the furniture, appliances, etc.\n\nthat you picked out for your home \u2014 wouldn't common sense strike you like, \"Oh my gosh, I'm in the wrong apartment!\"? Instead, Amber Guyger ignored all distinguishable signs \u2014 including the red mat outside the door \u2014 one of which she does not own or have outside her apartment door. According to NBC News, Guyger has proven that citizens might not be safe in their own homes, let alone on the streets.\n\nThe striking thing about this case is that this wasn't a resident-mistaken raid. It wasn't anything involving police business. This was ex-police officer Amber Guyger walking into an unarmed black man's home \u2014 ignoring all signs that it was not her home \u2014 and shooting him in the chest while he was reportedly eating ice cream.\n\nAmber Guyger versus the diverse jury\n\nLuckily for Botham Jean's family, this jury was not majority-white \u2014 as in so many other cases involving officers killing unarmed blacks by excessive, lethal force. For instance, if a scared, unarmed black teen runs away at a traffic stop, how is a trained officer's first response to pull out his service pistol and shoot to kill? Instead of the officer doing his job and running after the teen and using non-lethal means of apprehension, the black teen got three bullets in his back. I'm talking about Antwon Rose II, in case you were wondering. A majority-white jury acquitted the officer in that killing \u2014 like several other cases where unarmed blacks have been reduced to \"hashtags\" within the last five years.\n\nHonestly, this has been going on for decades. The crimes aren't new. The media coverage is new. So, it's great to see justice finally come to a victim's family \u2014 thanks to a highly-diverse jury panel.\n\nAmber Guyger received an unprecedented amount of coddling. The bailiff was also stroking her hair and rubbing her head. Again, \"where they do that at?\"", "description": "Many are calling it a 'slap in the face.'
