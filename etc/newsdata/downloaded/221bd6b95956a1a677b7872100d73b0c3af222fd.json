Five years without going to stadiums. People don't deserve to suffer.\"\n\nThe 53-year-old then appeared to break down in tears, and the conversation moved on to another guest.\n\nIt is thought Stoichkov was referring to the ban UEFA placed on English clubs from European competition in the aftermath of the Heysel disaster in 1985.\n\nSince the disgraceful events of Monday police have arrested six fans thought to have been responsible for the abuse and have identified a further nine, who are under police investigation.\n\nBulgaria manager Krasimir Balakov, meanwhile, has apologised for the fans' actions despite initially appearing to play down the severity of it.\n\nHe originally said he had not heard any abuse, but on Wednesday he issued a public statement which read: \"My comments prior to the game versus England \u2013 that Bulgaria did not have trouble with racism \u2013 were based on the fact that the local championship has not seen such an issue on a large scale.\n\n(Image: tudnusa/Instagram)\n\n\"There might have been isolated cases, but it is definitely not something that you see at the stadium.\n\n\"The majority of football fans do not participate in such chants and I believe this also to have been the case in the game against England.\n\n\"I would like to state one thing very clearly \u2013 since there have been reported cases of racial discrimination at the stadium in Sofia I, as Bulgaria national team head coach, would like to offer my sincere apologies to the English footballers and to anyone who felt offended.\"", "description": "The former Barcelona forward was appearing on sports channel TUDN and appeared overwhelmed at one point", "authors": ["Alex Milne", "Image", "Tudnusa Instagram"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20637292.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_LCP_CHP_161019BulgariaRacism_4248EnglandBulgariaRacismJPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
