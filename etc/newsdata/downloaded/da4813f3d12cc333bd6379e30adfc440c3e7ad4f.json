Not only did its Lion King collectables promotion deliver strong growth in comparable transactions, items per basket and overall items, but online sales came in at a staggering 43.2 per cent, suggesting Woolworths' digital strategy is accelerating.\n\nEven Big W looked good, continuing its recent momentum with comparable sales growth of 4.4 per cent - double the same rate for the December quarter last year.\n\nNo doubt the market will focus on that sales result, and ignore Woolworths\u2019 pay problems.\n\nBut quite appropriately, a chastened Brad Banducci certainly wasn\u2019t taking a victory lap on Wednesday.", "description": "It\u2019s hard to get away from the conclusion that Woolworths simply hasn\u2019t invested the care, attention and resources in paying staff properly as it has in growing sales.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7926%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/2ef057164755d542b6cde52ab8262ba98e16fe31", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
