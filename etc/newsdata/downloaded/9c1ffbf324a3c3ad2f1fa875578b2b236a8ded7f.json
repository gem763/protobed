A bare-knuckle scrap has begun \u2013 but will it be enough?\n\nDonald Trump has shown little taste for military adventure. He avoided the draft in Vietnam. He fell out with his once-beloved generals. He stunned the world by pulling troops out of Syria and abandoning America\u2019s Kurdish allies.\n\nBlow to Trump as DoJ ordered to turn over evidence from Mueller grand jury Read more\n\nBut on the political battlefield, the president has shown how he and his allies intend to fight impeachment: with a blitzkrieg aimed at deflecting, distracting and discrediting. What he lacks in coherent strategy, he makes up for in shock and awe. Trump will send in the tanks and take no prisoners.\n\nIt appears that most Republicans are still willing to march behind him, not by defending what many see as indefensible \u2013 the president\u2019s offer of a quid pro quo to Ukraine \u2013 but by throwing sand into the gears of the impeachment process. With the help of Fox News, they are set to intensify attacks on the legitimacy of the inquiry itself, demonising its leaders and sowing doubt wherever possible.\n\nThe great unknown is whether the approach will prove as effective as their efforts to undermine the special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation, potentially boosting Trump in the 2020 election, or the case against him will be so compelling that he will be removed from office or defeated at the polls.\n\n\u201cTrump is using the same approach he did to subvert the Mueller report: undermining the legitimacy of the messenger, assigning political motives to those who testify and relying on the Fox News firewall to serve up propaganda to his base,\u201d said Kurt Bardella, a former spokesperson and senior adviser for Republicans on the House oversight committee.\n\nNo matter who\u2019s working in the White House, we already know it will be blown to hell by Trump\u2019s tweets on any given day Kurt Bardella\n\n\u201cThe difference is that with Mueller we had a lot of time where we didn\u2019t know anything. In the impeachment inquiry we are getting a steady stream of new information that is providing context.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry is a month old. Unlike Mueller it has moved at warp speed, subpoenaing witnesses, gathering testimony and building evidence against the president some say makes it inevitable he will be impeached by the House and put on trial by the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nThis week Bill Taylor, the top US diplomat in Ukraine, made the most damning allegations yet about a quid pro quo in which Trump threatened to suspend military aid and the offer of a White House meeting unless Ukraine agreed to announce investigations into political rivals including the former vice-president Joe Biden, a potential opponent in next year\u2019s presidential election.\n\nTaylor, a respected Vietnam war veteran with half a century of public service, also described an \u201cirregular, informal policy channel\u201d by which the Trump administration was pursuing objectives in Ukraine \u201crunning contrary to the goals of longstanding US policy\u201d. His evidence reportedly prompted \u201ca lot of sighs and gasps\u201d in the hearing room.\n\nThe backlash from Trump was as swift as it was expected. Since the shadow of impeachment fell, the president has put down a daily barrage of tweets. Responding to Taylor and other members of his own party he sees as disloyal, he described \u201cNever Trumper Republicans\u201d as \u201chuman scum\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Steve Scalise speaks after he and two dozen other Republicans stormed the room used by the House of Representatives\u2019 impeachment inquiry.

The testimony of a Pentagon official was postponed by more than five hours. The members complained about lack of transparency as evidence is being given behind closed doors.\n\nIt was not their only gambit. Earlier in the week Republicans attempted to censure Adam Schiff, the chair of the House intelligence committee, for his handling of the impeachment inquiry, only for the Democratic majority to set the resolution aside. On Thursday Lindsey Graham, the chair of the Senate judiciary committee and a Trump loyalist, introduced a resolution condemning the inquiry as an unfair, secretive and designed to embarrass the president.\n\nIn an ominous development, the justice department stepped up its review of the origins of Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation, giving prosecutors the ability to issue subpoenas, potentially form a grand jury and compel witnesses to give testimony and bring federal criminal charges. The move raised fears of a politically motivated ploy to burnish the overall narrative that Trump is a victim of the deep state, casting impeachment as Mueller 2.0.\n\nBut there was still little sign of a war bunker where a strategy is being coordinated. Instead it appears to be a case of a scattergun and \u201cfire at will\u201d, a measure of how ill-equipped the White House is for the battle to come. More than 1,000 days into Trump\u2019s presidency, its ranks are severely depleted.\n\nThe chief strategist Steve Bannon is long gone. Stephanie Grisham, the press secretary, has never given a formal briefing to reporters in the west wing. Trump does not have a permanent chief of staff, only Mick Mulvaney in an acting capacity. Earlier this month Mulvaney held a disastrous briefing in which he blurted out a confession of a quid pro quo with Ukraine, only to issue a retraction later.\n\nBill Weld: Trump faces higher risk of removal if senators go to secret ballot Read more\n\nIt means there are fewer guardrails on a president who would be capricious, impulsive and mendacious even if surrounded by the best and the brightest.\n\nBardella added: \u201cNo matter who\u2019s working in the White House, we already know it will be blown to hell by Trump\u2019s tweets on any given day. You can have the best organisation in the world but it\u2019s useless if the principal is so undisciplined.\u201d\n\n\u2018Clinton had a pretty good approach\u2019\n\nThe lack of structure could not be more different from the last president to be impeached, Bill Clinton, who set up a dedicated \u201cwar room\u201d while getting on with the business of governing.\n\nGraham, now working with the White House on a better coordinated strategy but then an impeachment manager in the House, told reporters this week the Clinton example should be followed because he \u201chad a team that was organised, that had legal minds that could understand what was being said versus the legal proceedings in question, and they were on message every day\u201d.\n\nThe senator from South Carolina added: \u201cPresident Clinton defended himself but he never stopped being president. And I think one of the reasons that he survived is that the public may not have liked what the president had done but believed that he was still able to do his job \u2026 I\u2019m hoping that will become the model here.\u201d\n\nThe sentiment was echoed by Chris Ruddy, a conservative media executive and friend of Trump. He told the Guardian: \u201cBill Clinton had a pretty good approach \u2013 better than Richard Nixon. It should be \u2018business as usual\u2019 where they\u2019re pushing legislation on healthcare, immigration, infrastructure.\u201d\n\nPublic opinion does not favour removing Trump from office, Ruddy argued, so the White House should avoid a politically costly battle.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a political payback system where everyone is trying to out up each other. If you look at the poll numbers, he\u2019s actually holding up, although there\u2019s a hardening of people who favour impeachment and removal. He\u2019s not actually in a bad situation.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lindsey Graham talks about the Clinton impeachment while introducing a resolution condemning the House impeachment inquiry. Photograph: Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n\nOn Friday the Axios website reported \u201ca de facto impeachment war room\u201d had sprung up at the White House with the primary objective of ensuring that should the House impeach Trump, there will not be the 20 or more Republican defections required in the Senate to convict him.\n\n\u201cAlmost every morning around 10am, there\u2019s an impeachment \u2018messaging coordination\u2019 meeting in either the Situation Room or the Roosevelt Room\u201d involving senior officials, the report said.\n\nBut critics argue that \u201cmessaging\u201d is doomed from the start in this case because the facts are so devastating. Trump has openly encouraged Ukraine \u2013 and China \u2013 to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter. With Taylor\u2019s compelling evidence, it appears to be case closed. Some problems are unspinnable.\n\nRick Tyler, a Republican strategist and Trump critic, said the president\u2019s exertion of pressure on the leader of Ukraine had been tantamount to blackmail and extortion.\n\n\u201cIt was such an abuse of power. I can\u2019t think of a president who\u2019s done anything more impeachable or worse than that. It\u2019s indefensible and anyone who defends it is going to face some liabilities because it\u2019s so egregious.\u201d\n\nHe described the Republican fightback as \u201clawlessness, disorder and chaos. Undermining the process and smearing the witnesses and engaging in \u2018whataboutism\u2019 is the main strategy. The question is whether they will be successful, as they were with Mueller, at discrediting the process. Democrats have to step up their game and be more transparent about what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\n\u2018An exercise in table-pounding\u2019\n\nFor all the noisy grandstanding this week, Republicans said little about the substance of the allegations. Their extraordinary invasion of the Scif [Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility] on Capitol Hill was fodder for TV networks and briefly stole the limelight from the damaging evidence being presented. It seemed a classic Trumpian ploy of shifting attention with a showy spectacle and earned thanks from the president for being \u201ctough, smart, and understanding in detail the greatest Witch Hunt in American History\u201d.\n\nThe Scif incident was an exercise in table-pounding by Republicans \u2026 a very poor substitute for a strategy Bill Galston\n\nBut whether it can be sustained is questionable. Democrats are gearing up for televised hearings that could begin next month and feature dramatic and damaging testimony from the likes of the former national security adviser John Bolton. Republicans are hamstrung by a torrent of revelations that makes today\u2019s deniable rumour tomorrow\u2019s smoking gun.\n\nBill Galston, a former policy adviser in the Clinton administration, said: \u201cIf there is a White House strategy, I haven\u2019t discerned it up to now. It\u2019s very difficult to form a strategy that others are prepared to rely on and execute if you have reason to believe that that what is held to be true today might not be true tomorrow.\n\n\u201cThe White House has a credibility problem and members of the president\u2019s party don\u2019t know what they don\u2019t know.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a saying, \u2018If the facts are against you, argue the law. If the law is against you, argue the facts. If the law and the facts are against you, pound the table and yell like hell.\u2019 The Scif incident we saw this week was an exercise in table-pounding by Republicans. What they\u2019re doing now is a very poor substitute for a strategy.\u201d\n\nTrump's presidency is built on lies. Does he actually believe them? | Walter Shapiro Read more\n\nTrump retains two not so secret weapons to amplify his message: fiery rallies, which he is holding with greater frequency, and conservative media.\n\nA survey published this week by the Public Religion Research Institute showed the group most loyal to the president is Republicans who watch Fox News. More than half of Republicans whose primary news source is Fox said almost nothing could change their approval of Trump. For Republicans who get their news elsewhere, the figure is considerably lower.\n\nGalston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington, added: \u201cIf I was in the White House now, I would send a delegation to [Fox News host] Sean Hannity and say, \u2018Sir, you have more credibility with the president than anyone else. If you believe, as we do, that he needs a coherent strategy, can you make that case for us? We officially work for the president but you unofficially work for him.\u2019\n\n\u201cIt seems like a joke but, as I sit here and think about it, I\u2019m falling in love with the idea.\u201d", "description": "A hearing room is invaded, the president\u2019s enemies are \u2018scum\u2019.
