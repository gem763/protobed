Your muscles atrophy. Your bones deteriorate. One NASA study even found that prolonged time in the cosmos can alter the telomeres at the end of your DNA. Some of these effects are temporary, while others are obviously more permanent. Those of the mental variety tend to fall into the latter category. It\u2019s a tricky thing to measure, but your mind cannot be un-blown; looking down at the Earth like it\u2019s a marble in your hand isn\u2019t a perspective people lose. It\u2019s hard to imagine how differently someone might see the world after they\u2019ve looked at it from a god\u2019s-eye view \u2014 how someone could float amongst the stars one day, and eat dinner at Applebee\u2019s the next. Noah Hawley\u2019s \u201cLucy in the Sky\u201d spends two full hours trying to do just that, and it understandably comes up short.\n\n\u2014 it only knows that it does. When Lucy Cola (character names have been changed from their real-life counterparts) goes to space for the first time, she\u2019s overcome by the beauty that stretches before her. The first moments of the movie find Lucy drunk with awe as a knowing grin stretches across her face. This is what she\u2019s waited her entire life to see; this is what made her escape from a broken family, become the very best at everything that she ever did, and put up with who knows how much misogyny on her way to busting through the boys\u2019 club at NASA.\n\nMore from IndieWire\n\nAnd then, as she\u2019s yanked back to the shuttle, Lucy\u2019s smile fades. It\u2019s not just that she has to stop looking, it\u2019s that she\u2019s already seen too much. \u201cEveryone you know,\u201d she says via voiceover, \u201ceveryone you could ever know. On a tiny blue ball. Floating in nothing.\u201d That\u2019s it. That\u2019s all there is. And as soon as she touches down on terra firma, Lucy\u2019s world begins to feel smaller. Her lovingly square husband (Dan Stevens, whose mustached beta nerd is a pocket protector away from being one of Screech\u2019s friends on \u201cSaved by the Bell\u201d) seems even less scintillating than he did when she left, and the Moon might as well be taunting her every time that it rises in the night sky.\n\nThe walls of Lucy\u2019s existence are literally shrinking, as Hawley shrinks the frame down from 5:3 widescreen to the boxier, claustrophobic 4:3 Academy ratio as the film\u2019s heroine resettles into suburban life. The screen widens whenever Lucy participates in training exercises as part of her tryout for another mission, and it constrains whenever she visits her indomitable grandmother (an amusingly uncouth Ellen Burstyn, who refers to Lucy as \u201cfucker\u201d) or sits across the dinner table from her husband. Sometimes the image is just a thin slit of color, and sometimes it widens to fill up the entire screen. Hawley, whose corkscrew approach to human psychology made his \u201cFargo\u201d TV series an improbable hit, leans on this trick so much during the film\u2019s relatively lucid first act that it starts to feel as though the projector itself is growing and shrinking like a pupil reacting to light.\n\nIt\u2019s the most compelling thing about \u201cLucy in the Sky\u201d \u2014 a curious and unexpected wrinkle in a movie that sands off most of the dark humanity from the story that inspired it \u2014 and it\u2019s also the most glaring example of why the film is a failure. On one hand, the shifting aspect ratios allow Hawley to see inside Lucy\u2019s head and get a clear sense of what\u2019s clouding it; it\u2019s telling that the screen expands when she blows up some fireworks on her front lawn, but not when she first has sex with an almost sarcastically handsome fellow space cadet who seems determined to bone every woman who\u2019s ever gone into the stratosphere (Jon Hamm is the perfect hunk to play Mark Goodwin, a man who Burstyn\u2019s character describes as \u201ca divorced action figure who lives to go fast\u201d). Lucy wants that \u201castronaut dick\u201d (again, her grandmother\u2019s words), but those black vertical bars on either side of their afternoon tryst tell us that her affair with Mark isn\u2019t enough to fill the void that her out-of- this-world experience left behind. Hawley\u2019s big idea is clever for how it makes us feel as though we\u2019ve been let in on a secret that Lucy doesn\u2019t even know she\u2019s keeping.\n\nOn the other hand, the aspect ratios are so unambiguously expressive of Lucy\u2019s mindset that Portman doesn\u2019t have all that much to add. Her deep-fried accent, bob cut, and no-bullshit stride make her performance feel like an empty but loving homage to Holly Hunter in \u201cBroadcast News,\u201d and the script gives her a few different shades of dislocation with precious little nuance between them.", "description": "Based on a true story, this frustrating debut feature fails to explore the inner life of an astronaut who couldn't adjust to life on Earth.", "authors": ["David Ehrlich"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aKhIES8D8PtH_lO7331KxA--~B/aD01OTQ7dz0xMDU2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/indiewire_268/edd884c08999cf9f90767a5cd3a91062", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
