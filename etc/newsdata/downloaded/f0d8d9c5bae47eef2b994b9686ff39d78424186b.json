No doubt that the returning bullishness was felt in U.S. equity markets too on Friday till the weekly closing, while the S&P 500, ended up 0.41% on the day at 3,022.55. The index briefly breached its July 26 closing high and came within a point of breaking its intraday high of 3,027.98. The Nasdaq 100, meanwhile, soared to a new intraday high of 8,032.35 and closed up 0.78% to a new closing high of 8,029.22. I find that the global equity markets may feel some change in prevailing sentiments amid expectations that the Fed\u2019s Oct. 29-30 policy decision will yield in a third-straight rate cut for this year. Secondly, the changing global sentiments were also resulted in a rally in Crypto coins while the Bitcoin awoke from its slumber, with a double-digit pop Friday after China Presdient Xi Jingping extolled the benefits of blockchain, the software that powers the popular crypto currency.\n\nBut, a deeper global slowdown still more likely despite round of rate cuts according to Reuters poll https://www.investing.com/news/economy/deeper-global-slowdown-still-more-likely-despite-round-of-rate-cuts-2003875 No doubt that the hope on escalating U.S.-China trade tensions has pushed stocks back near record highs, a record $17 trillion of bonds have negative yields and a key market signal of U.S. recession is still flashing red. On the other hand, European Central Bank cut its deposit rate further into negative territory and announced it would resume its asset purchases, the Bank of Japan - which has essentially been running easy policy for two decades - and the Federal Reserve are due to cut rates again as early as next week.\n\nFinally, I conclude that the Nifty 50 may show some more strength amid growing volatility till the final Sino-U.S. Deal is sealed in mid November. No doubt that the changing sentiments in global equity markets may keep the bullish moves in Nifty 50 and Bank Nifty, but sell off will follow every sudden upward move.
