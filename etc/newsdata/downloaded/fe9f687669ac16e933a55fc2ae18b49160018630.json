Nobody comes out of the womb needing to buy two seats on the airplane.\"\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nMaher also said that in his opinion, fat-shaming \"doesn't need to end\", adding that \"some amount of shame is good\".\n\nCorden issued a chastising response to Maher's comments, stating that fat-shaming \"never went anywhere\".\n\n\"I mean, ask literally any fat person,\" Corden said. \"We are reminded of it all the time.\"\n\nCorden continued, explaining that there is a \"common and insulting misconception that fat people are stupid and lazy\".\n\nThe 41-year-old explained that he has struggled with weight management throughout his life and has been \"off and on diets\" on a regular basis.\n\n\"Here's the thing \u2013 we're not all as lucky as Bill Maher. We don't all have a sense of superiority that burns 35,000 calories a day,\" Corden said.\n\nThe Cats actor added that while he believes that Maher thinks he is offering \"tough love\" to people who are overweight, he is in fact \"working against his own cause\".\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Self-destructive behaviour like over-eating.\"\n\nCorden went on to explain the complexities of the obesity crisis, outlining how childhood obesity is linked to growing up in poverty.\n\nThe Into The Woods star added that genetics can also increase a person's risk of becoming overweight.\n\n\"Until we make healthy food and healthcare more accessible and we properly educate people on nutrition and exercise, maybe we can hold back on the whole 'call fat people virgins until they lose weight' strategy,\" he said.\n\nCorden concluded his segment with a direct message to Maher.\n\n\"Bill, please hear me when I say this,\" Corden said. \"While you're encouraging people to think about what goes into their mouths, just think a little harder about what comes out of yours.\"\n\nSeveral Twitter users praised Corden for taking a stand against Maher's stance on fat-shaming.\n\n\"This is absolutely brilliant and I love you for it. Thank you for using your platform for this,\" one person tweeted.\n\n\"Bravo James, well said. You reminded us that fat-shaming is bullying and bullying is not OK,\" another commented.\n\n\"Bullies have to be called out, and you handled the whole thing with great sensitivity.\"", "description": "James Corden has condemned comments made by Bill Maher about fat-shaming, including the affirmation that it \"needs to make a comeback\".", "authors": ["Sabrina Barr"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/13/10/james-corden-main.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
