This scrutiny only intensified after she gave birth to Princess Aiko in 2001 \u2014 the couple\u2019s only child.\n\nIn 2004, Naruhito accused palace minders of stifling his wife\u2019s personality, in unprecedented public remarks.\n\n\u201cTo me, Masako seems worn out in her efforts to adjust herself to life as a royal over the past 10 years\u2026 It is also true that there was something that amounted to a denial of Masako\u2019s former career,\u201d he said.\n\nHe described Masako as \u201canguished\u201d by the travel restrictions she faced after her previous diplomatic life.\n\nThe same year, the palace disclosed that Masako had been undergoing treatment for stress-induced \u201cadjustment disorder\u201d for almost her entire marriage.\n\nNaruhito later apologised for his remarks, but he has called for \u201cnew royal duties\u201d to fit modern times.\n\nThe pressure on Masako eased somewhat when her sister-in-law gave birth in 2006 to a son, the now 13-year-old Prince Hisahito.\n\nAnd she appeared confident during Naruhito\u2019s enthronement in May and at ease when the royal couple welcomed US President Donald Trump as the first foreign leader to greet the new emperor.\n\nIn particular, her ability to converse with first lady Melania Trump in fluent English was well-received.\n\n\u2013 Comforters-in-chief \u2013\n\nBefore his enthronement, Naruhito followed his father\u2019s lead by hitting back against revisionism on Japan\u2019s role in World War II, with remarks seen by some as a rebuke of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s nationalism.\n\nIn his first speech as emperor, to mark the end of World War II in August, Naruhito spoke of \u201cdeep remorse\u201d over the country\u2019s wartime past, echoing the language employed by his father, Akihito.\n\nNaruhito and Masako are expected to pursue the role of comforters-in-chief crafted by the previous emperor and empress, who won public support for meeting with victims of natural disasters.\n\nThe royal couple have expressed their \u201cheartache\u201d over typhoon Hagibis, which killed dozens of people this month.\n\nAnd there has been speculation that they may visit victims after the ceremonies related to the enthronement proclamation are complete.\n\nMasako\u2019s delicate health may however mean they \u201cwill not be able to do the same amount of activities\u201d as the former imperial couple, according to Hideya Kawanishi, an associate professor at Nagoya University and Japanese history expert.\n\nIn a statement released on her birthday in December, Masako pledged to do her best despite feeling \u201cinsecure\u201d about becoming empress, crediting the \u201cpowerful support\u201d of the public for her gradual recovery.\n\nDoctors have warned however that she will need to continue treatment and is susceptible to fatigue.", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 Japan\u2019s new Emperor Naruhito begins his reign facing the delicate task of balancing modernity with the traditions of the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/17/770b53_emperor-naruhito-we-masako-owada-in-1993-his-new-wife-leaving-promising-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
