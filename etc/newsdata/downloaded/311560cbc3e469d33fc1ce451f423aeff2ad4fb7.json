From a place called Bluff in the deepest south to Cape Reinga in the far north, Hansen can genuinely say the men wearing All Blacks jerseys at the Rugby World Cup have the full backing of their nation.\n\nRugby is more of an obsession than a game in the volcanic islands of New Zealand, from where the All Blacks have emerged as a globally-recognizable export. It\u2019s not the domain of the monied, it\u2019s every Kiwi\u2019s sport.\n\nEngland has the finances to outspend any union to prepare for the World Cup, but it can\u2019t match New Zealand\u2019s cultural connection to its team.\n\nJones knows that, so he\u2019s tried a few avenues to get under the skins of New Zealanders ahead of Saturday\u2019s semifinal at Yokohama. He has promoted the All Blacks as the best team in the history of sport, but then suggested they could be mentally fragile under the burden of knockout pressure.\n\nHe acknowledged the nation-wide appeal of the All Blacks, then chirped about New Zealand reporters covering the World Cup being merely fans with laptops. He even tossed in a spying allegation about somebody secretly filming England\u2019s practice, although he didn\u2019t specifically say it was from New Zealand.\n\nHansen\u2019s response has been subtle. He accepted Jones\u2018 rating of the All Blacks as being heartfelt and clearly well considered.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really nice statement and I wouldn\u2019t doubt that Eddie believes that, but he is also being quite kind to us,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cHistory is history and (this game) is about creating new history. Both teams are going to go at each other on Saturday and that game won\u2019t define either team, but it will give one team the opportunity to go through to play a final.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to how close England got to winning their most recent meeting - before slumping to a sixth consecutive loss.\n\nEngland has never beaten New Zealand at the World Cup, losing semifinals in 1991 and \u201895 and in the pool stage in \u201899. The overall record is New Zealand 33 wins and a draw in 41 matches. And, when asked where the Anglo-Kiwi match stood in the pantheon of rugby rivalries, Hansen selected South Africa as New Zealand\u2019s greatest rugby adversary, despite facing the double-headed monster of England with an antagonistic Aussie coach this weekend.\n\nPerhaps he was thinking further ahead to his ideal final. That could happen if New Zealand beats England on Saturday and South Africa beats Wales on Sunday at Yokohama.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve played England once in the last six years, so it\u2019s hard to build a rivalry when you don\u2019t play each other,\u201d Hansen said, implying it could be a more regular feature if the home nations really wanted it. Another little dig. \u201cIf we could get the Six Nations to come on board for a global season, we\u2019d be able to do that. Once they do that, then they\u2019re starting to think about the game rather than themselves.\u201d\n\nFor the benefit of any British journalists n the room, and any fans with keyboards, he added: \u201cThere\u2019s a headline for you.\u201d\n\nNew Zealand hasn\u2019t lost a game at the World Cup since an upset quarterfinal loss to France in 2007, adding its second title on home soil in 2011 and a third in England four years ago - when England failed to make it out of the group stage.\n\nEngland has always been strong at the set-piece, particularly the scrum. Hansen said New Zealand\u2019s forwards deserved more credit in that area.\n\nHe promoted the versatile Scott Barrett to the starting lineup to add size and bulk and another lineout option, relegating Sam Cane to the bench to send on as a finisher in the second half. It was the only change to the XV that started in the 46-14 quarterfinal win over Ireland.\n\nEngland can play a direct game with kickers playing for territory off strong set pieces and multiple forward phases.\n\nJones said the best four teams were still alive in the competition and, \u201cWe get to play one of the greatest teams ever, that are shooting for a \u2018three-peat\u2019, which has never been done, so that brings an element of pressure to their team.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any pressure, mate. No one thinks we can win,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are 120 million Japanese people out there whose second team are the All Blacks. So there\u2019s no pressure on us, we\u2019ve just got to have a great week, enjoy it, relax. Train hard and enjoy this great opportunity we\u2019ve got, whereas they\u2019ve got to be thinking about how they\u2019re looking for their third World Cup and so that brings some pressure.\u201d\n\nHansen rejected Jones\u2018 appraisal, saying he enjoyed some of his counterpart\u2019s one-liners but didn\u2019t take any of the mind games seriously.\n\n\u201cLogic would say we shouldn\u2019t be favorites because it\u2019s never been done before,\u201d Hansen said, adding that England really had more to lose considering the four-year buildup since a disappointing group-stage exit in 2015 when hosting the tournament.\n\n\u201cEngland were desperately disappointed with how they went,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be under immense pressure themselves. To say they\u2019ve got nothing to lose? Eddie doesn\u2019t believe that, either.\u201d\n\nJones was set to announce his team later Thursday, with most selection speculation around the inside backs.\n\nAfter coaching Australia to the World Cup final in 2003 and being a consultant to South Africa\u2019s winning campaign in 2007, Jones guided Japan to an unprecedented three wins in the 2015 World Cup and an epic upset over South Africa in the group stage. His wife is Japanese and his mother has Japanese heritage, so he has a good feel for the host nation. As England coach, he thinks he\u2019s up against it this weekend.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen all the All Black jerseys around,\u201d Jones said. \u201cEven my wife, I have to tell her to stop (supporting) them.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "There's a reason Steve Hansen is comfortable calling Eddie Jones' bluff.
