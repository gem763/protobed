A version of the painting appeared on the cover of The Saturday Evening Post on March 15, 1958.\n\n\u201cNorman Rockwell is one of the greatest visual storytellers of the 20th century and these stories are as relevant and powerful today as they were when Rockwell painted them,\u201d says Elizabeth Goldberg, Phillips \u2019 senior international specialist of American Art and deputy chairwoman, Americas. \u201cBefore the Shot is one of his most recognizable images and a prime example of his unmatched ability to capture a story with a single image.\u201d\n\nRockwell painted the work from a series of photographs he methodically staged inside the office of Dr. Donald Campbell, his personal physician in Stockbridge, Mass., which was Rockwell\u2019s home from 1953 until his death in 1978. Dr. Campbell served as the model for the doctor, and 8-year-old Eddie Locke, whom Rockwell chose right from the lunchroom at local Stockbridge Plain Elementary School, posed as the patient. Eddie would later go on to model for Rockwell\u2019s The Runaway.\n\n\u201cRockwell\u2019s work is imbued with emotion and has a timelessness that has made him one of the most sought-after artists of the 20th century,\u201d Goldberg says.\n\nThe artist often preferred painting regular people rather than professional models as subjects, which gave his paintings a true sense of middle-class, post-war life in America. He also knew first hand the reluctance of children visiting the doctor, since Rockwell was raising three young sons at the time.\n\nUpon completion of the painting, Rockwell gifted it to Dr. Campbell, who sold it through Bernard Danenberg \u2014Rockwell\u2019s primary dealer at the time\u2014in 1968 to the current owner\u2019s father, Goldberg says. It was Danenberg who organized the artist\u2019s first major exhibition.\n\nThe family, who wishes to remain anonymous, has had it in their collection since then. The work had been loaned to the Norman Rockwell Museum, where it hung for the last 13 years.\n\nBefore the Shot will be offered as a part of Phillips\u2019 upcoming 20th Century & Contemporary Art sale on Nov. 14 in New York. It\u2019s not only the first time that a work by Rockwell will appear in an Evening Sale of 20th Century & Contemporary Art, but it\u2019s also the first time that a Rockwell painting will be offered at Phillips.\n\nOther highlights from sale include Joan Mir\u00f3\u2019s Paysan catalan inquiet par le passage d'un vol d'oiseaux, Pablo Picasso\u2019s Femme assise dans un fauteuil, and Morris Louis\u2019 Singing from the Collection of Florence Knoll Bassett. Works by Andy Warhol, Jean-Michel Basquiat, and Roy Lichtenstein will also be offered at the sale.\n\n\u201cThis auction marks the first time that Norman Rockwell will be offered in an Evening Sale of 20th Century & Contemporary Art beside these blue-chip artists,\u201d Goldberg says. \u201cWe are proud to present Rockwell alongside these 20th century masters, a place we believe he rightfully belongs.\u201d", "description": "The painting is expected to fetch between $2.5 million to $4.5 million", "authors": ["Jennifer Tzeses"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-118906/social", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
