By 2016, the price had dropped to $58.9 million before finally being sold at $33.25 million.\n\n'The Plaza is undervalued. But people are getting tired of the glass towers. It will come back,' said one broker, who has toured the unit, according to the New York Post. 'This is a steal.'\n\nThe designer property features its own turret, one of just a few in the city to have one, and the sale reportedly comes with some of the lavish furniture.\n\nThe first floor makes heavy use of elegant black lacquered walls, including in this study\n\nThe kitchen is done in a similar style, giving the penthouse a modern flair in a hotel known for its French-Renaissance style\n\nPerhaps one of the most distinctive rooms in the penthouse is the dome (pictured), which features a mural painted by Hillary Knight, the original illustrator of the Eloise books, that features the Hilfiger family\n\nThe first floor has views overlooking Fifth Avenue, known for having some of the most expensive shopping in the world, as well as Manhattan's skyline.\n\nThere is a formal dining room with a wet bar, a breakfast room right under the dome of the Plaza Hotel, and a paneled library nook.\n\nAn eat-in kitchen, powder room, family room and study also fill the floor. A curving staircase leads to the second level, where a private terrace in the master bedroom suite offers an incredible view of Central Park.\n\nThe bedroom also has a dressing room and a walk-in closet.\n\nOne of the bedrooms is done completely in black and white, giving it a crisp and contemporary feel\n\nThe four bedrooms in the condo are incredibly distinct - with this one done up completely in a bright lavender\n\nAlso on the floor are three bedrooms, two with private bathrooms, and a sitting room\n\nAnd the suite's master bathroom is equally luxurious, complete with a tub and more windows overlooking Central Park\n\nAlso on the floor are three bedrooms, two with private bathrooms, and a sitting room.\n\nApartment 1809 at One Central Park South comes with all the perks of a hotel - including valet parking, housecleaning and room service from celebrity chef Todd English's restaurant.\n\nHilfiger once told CNN that he wanted the space to reflect an earlier era of the Plaza in the 1960s, when author Truman Capote held his famous Black and White Ball for the upper crust of Manhattan.\n\nThe first floor makes heavy use of elegant black lacquered walls, coordinated with deep rich reds and even cheetah print.\n\nHilfiger had reclaimed wood floors and vintage fireplaces from England installed in the unit, which is also decorated with antiqued mirrors.\n\nThe influences of the era is visible in Hilfiger's love for pop art, including this Andy Warhol portrait of Elizabeth Taylor\n\nA plush living room is decorated with a white, fluffy carpet, a large fireplace and views of Central Park\n\nIf the dome's breakfast nook feels too intimate for the occasion, there is a full dining room right off to the side\n\nWhile some of the rooms are done in the crisp and elegant cream and gold colors one would expect to see inside a five-star hotel, others have much more personality.\n\nOne of the bedrooms is done in a bright lavender, while the children's bedroom is decorated in a red and blue nautical theme that seems to be directly inspired by Hilfiger's own fashion lines.\n\nPerhaps most distinctive is the dome which features a mural painted by Hillary Knight, the original illustrator of the Eloise books.\n\nWhile some of the rooms are done in the crisp and elegant cream and gold colors one would expect to see inside a five-star hotel, others have much more personality\n\nHilfiger wanted the apartment to harken back to the height of 1960s glamour at the hotel, when Truman Capote threw his famous Black and White Ball\n\nThis nautical-themed children's bedroom looks like it was ripped right out of one of Hilfiger's own catalogs\n\nJust like Hilfiger's family, Eloise lives in the room on the 'tippy-top floor' of the Plaza Hotel, as the classic goes.\n\nKnight incorporated both Eloise and members of the Hilfiger family into the mural.\n\nBut Hilfiger's love for contemporary pop art also shone through the interior, which was decorated throughout with paintings by the likes of Andy Warhol, Keith Haring, Richard Prince and graffiti artist Jean-Michel Basquiat.\n\nHilfiger said in the past he wanted to build 'a home' at the Plaza, but is now saying goodbye to the apartment for good as he and Ocleppo spend most of their time at the family's Greenwich, Connecticut estate.\n\nThey also have a home in Miami and a hideaway villa in Mustique, a private island in the Caribbean.", "description": "Designer Tommy Hilfiger and wife Dee Ocleppo have sold their luxury New York Penthouse after the Plaza Hotel property had been on the market on and off for 11 years.", "authors": ["Sophie Tanno For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/12/19392424-0-image-a-78_1570446395066.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
