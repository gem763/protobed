It may not be what you expected because you wanted him to go to (Heroes Acre) but what we have done is our father\u2019s wishes.\u201d\n\nMnangagwa, who was represented by government officials, had initially pushed for Mugabe to be buried at the monument for liberation war heroes - an occasion political analysts and ZANU-PF party sources said Mnangagwa wanted to use to display a public reconciliation with Mugabe\u2019s admirers.\n\nSlideshow (8 Images)\n\nMugabe\u2019s family had since the arrival of his body from Singapore, kept vigil over his remains because the former president had expressed fears to close family members before his death that some of the people who ousted him would seek to conduct a traditional ritual with some of his body parts, Mugabe\u2019s nephew Leo Mugabe said.\n\nZANU-PF spokesman Simon Khaya Moyo said in a statement that the decision to bury Mugabe in Kutama was most unfortunate, in a sign of the continued fall-out between the ruling party and the family.\n\n\u201cWe indeed respect the wishes of the families of deceased heroes, hence get saddened when manoeuvres that border on political gimmicks begin to unfold on an issue concerning an illustrious liberation icon,\u201d Khaya Moyo said.", "description": "Zimbabwe's founding leader Robert Mugabe was buried on Saturday in his home village of Kutama, ending a dispute between his family and the government of his successor President Emmerson Mnangagwa over his final resting place.", "authors": ["Gift Sukhala", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190928&t=2&i=1434953492&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8R0J6", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
