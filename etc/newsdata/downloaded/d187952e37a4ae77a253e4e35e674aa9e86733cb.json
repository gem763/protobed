Bush.\n\nThat would be, the man whose image not long ago graced many a Democrat\u2019s bumper with the added accent of devil horns.\n\nThat would also be the man at the helm during the Iraq War.\n\nAnd that would be the war which Democrats \u2014 including Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer, Dianne Feinstein, and Joe Biden (Obama wasn\u2019t yet in Congress) \u2014 voted to declare.\n\nAs for the Ellen issue, Meghan McCain asserted having friendships with those who believe differently is a good thing. Sort of:\n\n\u201cI think part of the issue is, and I\u2019m, like, somewhere in the middle on all of this. It\u2019s not that we can\u2019t have be friends on both sides. Obviously, we all do. Any normal person probably does. I don\u2019t choose my friends based on their political background \u2014 I mean, unless it\u2019s something truly radical. I would have a hard time being friends with Rand Paul or anyone associated with him, I\u2019m just gonna put that right there. I say it on the show every day because I won\u2019t be here tomorrow.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cBlood on your hands, Rand Paul.\u201d\n\n\ufeff\n\nThe daughter of late Senator John recalled the extreme characterization of W. back in the day:\n\n\u201cThere is a revisionist history with the Bush administration that I take intense umbridge with. I think, great, Michelle Obama wants to be friends with him, but I remember the things said about President Bush when he was in power. He was called for impeachment, a warmonger, lied about weapons of mass destruction and Hurricane Katrina. Part of the issue for me is just confusion. Did your opinion on Hurricane Katrina and the Iraq War change? There has to be a level of consistency with your politics. I don\u2019t blame Ellen.\u201d\n\nMeghan apparently agrees, in part, with Bill Maher: They were all just messin\u2019 around with the terrible things said about Bush, but Trump is truly awful:\n\n\u201cThe revisionist history about President Bush, my husband says when you cry wolf with every Republican which is what I believe happened with Bush, Romney, my father on forward, sometimes when you cry wolf, the beast shows up, and the beast is Donald Trump. I think part of the reason is maybe take a second look at some conservatives when you talk crap about them while they\u2019re in power.\u201d\n\nBy the way, here\u2019s what Bill had to say in 2016:\n\n\u201cI know liberals made a big mistake, because we attacked [George W.] like he was the end of the world. And he wasn\u2019t. And Mitt Romney, we attacked that way. I gave Obama a million dollars because I was so afraid of Mitt Romney. Mitt Romney wouldn\u2019t have changed my life that much, or yours. Or John McCain. They were honorable men who we disagreed with, and we should have kept it that way. So we cried wolf, and that was wrong. But this is real. This is going to be way different.\u201d\n\nBack to The View, following Meghan\u2019s remark came Whoopi\u2019s eyebrow-raiser.\n\nBuckle up:\n\n\u201cThere are some conservatives that have done some really good stuff.\u201d\n\nYes!\n\nDo it to it, Whoopi.\n\nLet us all remember this day in history \u2014 October 10th, 20HolyCow.\n\n\u201cGeorge, for whatever it\u2019s worth, did a lot of stuff I didn\u2019t like, but something he did do was he had a smart idea \u2014 how to deal with immigration. I liked that. And your own party \u2014 your own party pooped all over it, and it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nWhoopi said if she were Ellen, she would\u2019ve \u201cmess[ed] with George:\n\n\u201cThe man who owns the Cowboys sent tickets and she ended up sitting next to Bush. These are two gay women. If he has got a problem, he\u2019s going to be real uncomfortable. I would be leaning on him. I would be just hugging him. I would be messing with him because if you have the opportunity to take a second to show people your humanity, why wouldn\u2019t you try?\u201d\n\nFrom all I\u2019ve observed of George, something tells me he would\u2019ve loved it.\n\n-ALEX\n\nSee 3 more pieces from me:\n\nMeghan McCain Explodes, Tells Off The Panel On Mueller & Trump; Joy & Sunny\u2019s Response Is Why Dems Will Lose In 2020\n\nMeghan McCain Has A Message For Eric Swalwell & His Ageist Condemnation Of Biden: The \u2018Asterisk\u2019 Needs To \u2018Take A Seat\u2019\n\nBill Maher Blasts Cancel Culture: SJW\u2019s Don\u2019t Want Justice.
