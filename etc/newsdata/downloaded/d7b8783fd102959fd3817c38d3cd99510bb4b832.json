REUTERS/Ting Shen\n\n(Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency granted some refineries full waivers from the nation\u2019s biofuels regulation for the 2018 compliance year, even though the Department of Energy had recommended partial exemptions for those facilities, according to an EPA memo seen by Reuters.\n\nThe decision is likely to upset the U.S. corn lobby, which has said the Trump administration\u2019s decision in August to grant 31 full exemptions to refineries poses a threat to corn-based ethanol demand, hurting farmers who have already been adversely impacted by the U.S. trade war with China.\n\nThe EPA granted \u201cfull exemptions for those 2018 small refinery petitions where DOE recommended 50 percent relief,\u201d said the memo dated Aug. 9 and signed by Anne Idsal, EPA\u2019s acting assistant administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation.\n\nIt granted full exemptions to all refineries \u201cwhere DOE recommended 100 percent relief,\u201d the memo said.\n\nAn EPA official was not immediately available to comment.\n\nUnder the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard, oil refineries are required to blend biofuels like corn-based ethanol into their fuel or purchase credits from those that do, a law intended to help farmers and cut U.S. dependence on foreign oil but which refiners say costs them a fortune.\n\nThe RFS, however, allows the EPA to grant waivers from the regulation to small refining facilities of 75,000 barrels per day or less, if they can prove that compliance would cause them disproportionate economic hardship. Under the process, the Department of Energy assesses the applications and provides recommendations to the EPA, which makes a final decision.\n\nSince Trump took office, the EPA has vastly expanded its use of the exemptions, providing waivers to small facilities owned by billionaire investor Carl Icahn here and by oil majors like Exxon Mobil here and Chevron Corp here according to Reuters reporting.\n\nUnder pressure over the most recent round of 31 waivers, Trump last month promised a \u201cgiant package\u201d to farmers to boost the market for ethanol. That plan has yet to be released.", "description": "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency granted some refineries full waivers from the nation\u2019s biofuels regulation for the 2018 compliance year, even though the Department of Energy had recommended partial exemptions for those facilities, according to an EPA memo seen by Reuters.", "authors": ["Jarrett Renshaw", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433375209&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N17R", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
