It\u2019s when grade-schooler Alvy Singer (Allen) and his mother visit psychiatrist Dr. Flicker to find out why the boy stopped doing his homework or anything else. \u201cThe universe is expanding,\u201d Alvy explains. His mother snaps \u201cWhat is that your business!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow timeless, the scene should be studied by every pundit and fake-news journalist who promotes recent children\u2019s crusades \u2014 including such poster kids as Greta Thunberg and David Hogg \u2014 as politically expedient.\n\nUsing children to push political agendas, the most shameless form of propaganda, characterizes the new movie Socrates, a Brazilian coming-of-age film in which a suddenly orphaned black 15-year-old ironically named Socrates (Christian Malheiros) learns how the cruel world works at the same time that he realizes he is \u201cdifferent.\u201d\n\nSocrates, set in Sao Paulo\u2019s teeming slums, combines poverty porn with identity politics \u2014 imagine an unhysterical version of Precious. Director Alexandre Moratto pushes all the social-justice warrior buttons, but the film\u2019s primary tool is Socrates himself. Malheiros\u2019s innocence and clearly readable passions are spotlighted as an idealized form of human experience \u2014 the more pathetic, the better. An impoverished black, a social cast-off and virginal romantic, a disenfranchised teen, Socrates has a purity that\u2019s meant to convince us that his aspirations, as well as the fears he feels, all derive from innate wisdom that cannot be questioned.\n\nJust as Socrates is full of pathos, is it also humorless. We\u2019re meant to feel pity and then repent of our own shame. But while watching the handsome kid\u2019s suffering, I also noticed the filmmaker\u2019s tendency to sanctify his experience as somehow more virtuous than that of other, older characters (especially a bovine, maternal janitoress and the defensive gay youth who becomes Socrates\u2019s first inamorato, a heartbreaker who initiates the teenager\u2019s rite of passage). Like so many youths, Socrates\u2019s most damaging pathology is being convinced that he is pathetic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrading on sentimentality, this type of storytelling coerces viewers by projecting social consciousness through juvenile media icons. Above all, the ploy is politically devious; the idea of innocence is manipulated as rhetoric. Today\u2019s uncritical perception of childhood sagacity is both an artistic and sociological problem.\n\nThat\u2019s why recalling \u2014 and revisiting \u2014 the \u201cuniverse is expanding\u201d scene in Annie Hall is deeper than Socrates and so much more restorative.\n\nAllen\u2019s agitated mother and the laid-back shrink are lightly caricatured, yet their concern portrays an earlier, more honest guardianship that is now lost to the media that are promoting and exploiting the narcissism of Millennials. Through Allen\u2019s satire of his own neuroses, we get a much-needed satire of existential, ecological panic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a challenge to maintain skepticism about Socrates with its new Third World version of Dickens\u2019s Little Nell and to remain dubious about the activism fronted by juvenile figures such as Thunberg and Hogg. People take this stuff very personally and become irrational and hostile should anyone question the purity of childhood provocateurs. But protestation by Alvy\u2019s mother and Dr. Flicker\u2019s world-weary nonchalance provide a helpful balance that disarms poster-child na\u00efvet\u00e9.\n\nWhen Alvy\u2019s mother complains, \u201cIt\u2019s something he read!\u201d it\u2019s a eureka moment. The skit conveys the idea that believing in the end of the world is eschatological folly. Allen\u2019s wit is prescient. It undercuts the indoctrination that is now taken for granted in contemporary education institutions and in films like Socrates.\n\nSometimes it takes an old movie to rectify a new one and to expose trendy emotions.
