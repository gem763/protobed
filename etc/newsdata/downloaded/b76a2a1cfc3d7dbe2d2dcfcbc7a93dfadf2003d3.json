Here\u2019s How.", "language": "en", "text": "The opinions expressed by columnists are their own and do not represent the views of Townhall.com.\n\nEditor's Note: This piece was co-authored by Casey Welch.\n\nWe asked, they answered: In two back-to-school polls, a mere 5% of students and 13% of parents said they strongly agreed that schools are teaching \u201cuseful skills that will help them in the real world.\u201d The majority of both groups also said schools aren\u2019t doing enough to prepare students for a career after graduation.\n\nFortunately, this clear feedback also points toward an obvious set of solutions. By changing not only what we teach, but how and with whom we teach, we can once again earn parents\u2019 and students\u2019 trust that the time students spend in school actually positions them for successful lives after they graduate.\n\nThat starts with revisiting pre-graduation pathways and testing our assumptions about what students really need. When a high school student asks, \u201cWill I ever use this?\u201d we need to actually think through that answer. If the likelihood leans toward no, what needs to be done next should speak for itself.\n\nOf course, there are certain things students may not use every single day, but are foundational to later learning. That\u2019s why our K-8 core subjects will always serve an important purpose. But there is significant room for creativity with electives or high school-level classes that can kill two birds with one stone.\n\nThis is also where schools don\u2019t need to go it alone. Employers across the country are struggling to find individuals with the skills they need in areas like advanced manufacturing or IT. Their input into curriculum design and course offerings is invaluable to schools otherwise guessing at the knowledge their students need.\n\nWith better alignment, students will also be prepared to take on \u201cearn to learn\u201d opportunities like internships or job shadowing, connections that can be facilitated by online networking platforms like Tallo. Getting paid while also being in school is one of the best ways to solve the student-debt crisis currently engulfing our youngest generations.\n\nThis is another issue that parents and students were in sync on: 93% of students and 87% of parents believe student debt in the United States is a serious \u2013 if not very serious \u2013 problem. It\u2019s why almost all students (94%) and parents (92%) think giving students the option to earn college credit early could help, as would providing increased exposure to future career fields.\n\nThe challenges are especially acute in those areas far from the big cities that have generated most of the recent job growth. It could take hours to reach the nearest city \u2013 where there\u2019s likely more industry diversity \u2013 and small districts may not have the funds to support such a field trip. Even if they do, interacting with a potential employer just once before graduating high school and making life-altering decisions about what comes next is not nearly enough.\n\nThe internet can break down these geographic and socioeconomic barriers, allowing students to see what opportunities await them at, near or far away from home. However, we are well past simply showing students what jobs are out there. Today, students can do what they do best \u2013 use their phone to be digitally social creatures \u2013 and interact with employers who can answer their questions about the industry, tell them what kind of continuing education they\u2019re going to need, and keep those lines of communication open so that when they are looking to launch their career, they already have contacts made.\n\nWe know what we have to do to help prepare students for \u201cthe real world,\u201d and we have the tools to help them do it. Let\u2019s not waste any more time \u2013 or lose any more faith from America\u2019s parents and students \u2013 putting this solution into action.\n\nShaun McAlmont, Ed.D. is K12\u2019s President for Career Readiness Education.\n\nCasey Welch is the president and CEO of Tallo, an online platform that connects talent with opportunities.", "description": "Editor's Note: This piece was co-authored by Casey Welch.\u00a0We asked, .09/24/2019 11:13:39AM EST.", "authors": ["Dr. Shaun", "Cortney O'Brien", "Katie Pavlich", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/275/f225cc62-bbfb-4857-a6a0-cd6825e9ef48.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
