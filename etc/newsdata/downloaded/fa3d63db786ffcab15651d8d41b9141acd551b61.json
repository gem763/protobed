But\u2026 not everyone will get a taste of it.\n\nIn a tweet, a spokesperson confirmed the company is \u201crolling out dark mode for Gmail in the latest update.\u201d The spokesperson added that users with Android 10 and iOS 11 (and newer versions) should see an option to enable it in settings \u201csoon.\u201d\n\n\u201cCurrently dark mode options are only available for Android 10+ and iOS 11+,\u201d the spokesperson said in a follow-up tweet. \u201cIf these OS versions are available for your device we recommend updating in order to use dark mode.\u201d\n\nHi there. We\u2019ve started rolling out dark mode for Gmail in the latest update. You should see an option to enable it if you have iOS 11+/Android 10+ soon. Also, you can submit feedback regarding the mark as read option: Gmail app > Help & feedback > Send Feedback? Appreciate it! \u2014 Gmail (@gmail) October 9, 2019\n\nIn other news, Google also teased dark mode for Maps via the official Android account on Instagram. The post suggests the feature should already be available on Android 10, but there\u2019s no mention of iOS yet.\n\nIndeed, some Redditors have been spotting minor hints of dark mode in Maps in older devices already, like dark-themed buttons.\n\nWhile most iPhone users shouldn\u2019t encounter any trouble updating to a version of iOS with support for dark mode, that might be an issue for Android users \u2014 especially owners of handsets running custom skins \u2014 who tend to receive such updates with a delay.\n\nI\u2019m currently using a Huawei P30 Pro, and have yet to receive the update for Android 10, for instance. My colleague Ivan Mehta was able to switch on dark mode for Gmail on his iPhone 11, though. Here\u2019s a look at it:\n\nTo get the new theme in Gmail on your iPhone, you have to enable dark mode on iOS. Alternatively, head to Settings > Theme from the Gmail app (though that setting doesn\u2019t seem to be available to all iOS 13 users yet).\n\nAs is the case with rollouts like that, some users might get dark mode with a slight delay \u2014 even if your phone runs the newest version of Android or iOS. So don\u2019t be too discouraged if you\u2019re one of these people.\n\nRead next: Data analysis: Where you should focus your link-building efforts", "description": "Google has confirmed it's releasing dark mode for Gmail and Maps for Android 10 and iOS 11+, which leaves everyone else with older OS versions in the cold.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2Fdark-mode-gmail-maps-google-ios-android.jpg&signature=e6dc8b06da8a67cd4bd5546e4ad783a5", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
