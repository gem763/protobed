It's essential that residents are prepared, and many that have experienced storms before will be. But what happens if you've never been in a cyclone before? There are some essential ways you'll need to prepare, including looking after your pets.\n\nWhile you prep, you should also make a plan for your dog\u2019s needs, too. On Twitter, one user shared a suggestion by way of Patriot K-Nine Training: To avoid the problem of walking your dog outside to relieve themselves, make a simple indoor bathroom. Hurricane conditions might spook your pet or endanger them if there\u2019s flying debris.\n\nAll you\u2019ll need to accomplish this is a kiddie pool and a few pieces of turf. Put the turf in the pool and place it in your garage or anywhere else safe, so that your dog can do their business without going outside.\n\n\u201cIf possible, store the poop in small Ziploc-type bags & sprinkle baking soda under the sod to help control odour,\u201d one user on Twitter added. \u201cIf you can fit the kiddie pool in a tent, even better!\u201d\n\nAnd if you choose to go outside, never let your dog off the leash. As Patriot K-Nine Training also recommends, get your pet microchipped now, in advance of any disaster, so you can be reunited in the event of an escape.", "description": "Tropical Storm Dorian is currently approaching Florida.
