He made millions with no experience whatsoever,\" Hannity reacted, adding that Democrats \"call any accusation of misconduct against the former vice president an unproven conspiracy theory. The problem with that lie is that everything we have been reporting about the Biden family business of corruption is dead-on accurate. He had no experience.\"\n\nThe host also criticized Robach's interview questions, calling them \"softball questions.\"\n\n\"Virtually no follow-up questions at all. Could you imagine, by the way, how would the media mob be reacting if you replace the name 'Joe and Hunter Biden' with, say, 'Donald Trump and Don Jr.?'\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHannity also blasted Biden's performance in the interview.\n\n\"What we saw on ABC is a blatant attempt to spin and deflect and lie in what is a growing real scandal that's not going away,\" Hannity said.", "description": "Sean Hannity\u00a0on Tuesday night slammed\u00a0Joe Biden's son Hunter's interview with ABC News' \"Good Morning America,\" in which Hunter defended his family\u00a0over accusations of corruption involving Ukraine.", "authors": ["Victor Garcia"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/16/694940094001_6095131405001_6095130674001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
