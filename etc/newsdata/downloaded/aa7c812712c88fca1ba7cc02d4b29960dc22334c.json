PRECIOUS-Gold holds steady as focus turns to Fed meeting\n\n* Palladium off record high hit on Monday\n\n* $1,480 a key support level for gold -analysts\n\n\n\n(Adds quotes, updates prices)\n\nBy Brijesh Patel\n\nSept 17 (Reuters) - Gold prices were steady on Tuesday as\n\ninvestors adopted a wait-and-see approach ahead of the U.S.\n\nFederal Reserve's two-day monetary policy meeting, when the\n\ncentral bank is widely expected to cut interest rates.\n\nSpot gold firmed slightly, adding 0.1% to $1,499.24\n\nan ounce by 0937 GMT.\n\nGold prices rose more than 1% early Monday before settling\n\n0.6% up for the day after a weekend attack on oil facilities in\n\nSaudi Arabia inflamed worries over stability in the Middle East.\n\nU.S. gold futures GCv1 were down 0.3% at $1,507.\n\n\"The market is relatively stable, there is so much\n\n(interest) pointed towards the Fed meeting tomorrow, it seems\n\nlike traders have taken a little bit of a pause,\" said OANDA\n\nsenior market analyst Craig Erlam.\n\n\"Gold got a bit of a bounce yesterday from the geopolitical\n\n(fallout) from the attacks, but it didn't even break the $1,520\n\nlevel on the news, which suggests that gold is a little\n\nvulnerable, with $1,480 being the key support level.\"\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is widely expected\n\nto cut interest rates at its two-day meeting starting later in\n\nthe day. It would be the central bank's second such cut after\n\nlowering rates in July for the first time since the financial\n\ncrisis. FEDWATCH\n\nThe expected decision from the Fed could put pressure on the\n\nBank of Japan to ease policy at a meeting due on Thursday.\n\nLower interest rates decrease the opportunity cost of\n\nholding non-yielding bullion and weigh on the dollar, making\n\ngold cheaper for investors holding other currencies.\n\nHowever, the dollar index held on to Monday's gains\n\nto stand at 98.645. USD/\n\nGold prices have climbed nearly 18%, or more than $200,\n\nsince touching a 2019 low of $1,265.85 in early May, driven by a\n\ndovish outlook from major central banks, escalation in the\n\nU.S.-China trade war and Middle East tensions.\n\nAttacks on Saudi Arabia's main oil refinery over the weekend\n\nhave also entered the equation, prompting U.S. President Donald\n\nTrump to apply more pressure on the Fed to lower rates.\n\n\"It appears conviction remains positive so long as gold\n\nhangs around $1,500,\" AxiTrader strategist Stephen Innes said in\n\na note, adding that the market has been caught between hedging\n\nagainst a possible U.S. military response on Iran and\n\nposition-squaring ahead of the Fed's meeting.\n\nElsewhere, silver edged 0.1% higher to $17.86 an\n\nounce, while platinum XPT= slipped 0.4% to $933.15.\n\nPalladium XPD= dipped 0.6% to $1,595.37 after touching a\n\nrecord high of $1,626.81 in the previous session.\n\n\n\n", "description": "PRECIOUS-Gold holds steady as focus turns to Fed meeting", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB6K013_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
