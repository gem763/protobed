It had been \u2018confusing and distressing for fans,\u2019 he said, and had \u2018led to some difficulties with the bankers Santander\u2019.\n\nPrince Abdullah has been involved in dispute with Sheffield United co-owner Kevin McCabe\n\nThe Bin Laden connection emerged during a six-week long High Court trial in the summer when it became clear Prince Abdullah had borrowed money from Saleh Bin Laden through his connections in Saudi Arabia to help the club through cash-flow problems in 2018.\n\nHe went on to speak in support of the Bin Laden family at a press conference in Sheffield last month shortly after Mr Justice Fancourt had ruled in his favour in the complicated ownership case and dismissed allegations of bribery against him. McCabe was ordered to sell his 50 per cent stake in the club to the prince for \u00a35million.\n\nIn return, Prince Abdullah was given until next summer to purchase from McCabe various properties, including the stadium at Bramall Lane and the club\u2019s training ground and academy, thought to be worth around \u00a350m.\n\nThe Saudi prince became involved with the Blades when the club were in League One in 2013\n\nJustice Fancourt also ruled broadly in favour of the prince when it came to costs on Monday and will consider indemnity costs for him in view of the \u2018extremely serious\u2019 bribery allegations which took up so much prominence in the case against him and were found to have \u2018no proper foundation\u2019.\n\nHe rejected McCabe\u2019s right to appeal his verdict in the High Court but the case will drag on with McCabe set to take it to the Court of Appeal. The judge has retired to look into McCabe\u2019s efforts to safeguard his stake in the club should his appeal be upheld.\n\n\u2018As matters stand the club is going to be sailing quite close to the wind,\u2019 said Paul Downes QC, representing McCabe.\n\nMr Downes explained how the Blades would be expected to pay \u00a320m for goalkeeper Dean Henderson in June, at the end of his loan from Manchester United, and how players will share a \u00a310m bonus if they avoid relegation.", "description": "Sheffield United's reputation with the banks has been damaged by the connection between owner Prince Abdullah and the Bin Laden family, a court has been told.", "authors": ["Matt Barlow For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/22/19711144-0-image-a-11_1571087564478.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
