It is, then, next-level strategic genius to choose this moment to implode the People\u2019s Vote campaign. Roland Rudd, who when he\u2019s not doing PR for financial firms moonlights as chairman of Open Britain \u2013 one of the organisations that makes up People\u2019s Vote \u2013 has led moves to sack the campaign\u2019s director, James McGrory, and its head of communications, ex-Labour adviser Tom Baldwin. Blood is being spilt, and very publicly: staff have staged a mass walkout, Rudd\u2019s faction is threatening to prosecute McGrory and Baldwin for trespassing, and both sides are fighting it out on Sky News while claiming everything is fine.\n\nHere is a salutary lesson that should have been heeded long ago. During the referendum, the official remain outfit \u2013 Britain Stronger In Europe \u2013 waged a corporate-backed campaign that lacked any appeal to the electorate. To borrow an expression, they brought a calculator to a knife fight. They could have learned from this lesson. They clearly have not.\n\nIf you wanted a personification of everything people resent about the establishment, Rudd is not a bad person to start with. A multimillionaire who has been repeatedly voted as one of Britain\u2019s most influential financial PR executives, he is also the brother of Tory politician Amber Rudd and is deeply embedded in the country\u2019s elite networks. Peter Mandelson is godfather to one of his children and he was an unofficial adviser to Tony Blair, whose son did work experience at Rudd\u2019s firm while he was prime minister.\n\nIf you wanted a personification of everything people resent about the establishment, Roland Rudd is not a bad start\n\nAnd herein lies the problem that has bedevilled the People\u2019s Vote campaign from the start: for some of the campaign\u2019s protagonists this has always been about winning back power. There have, of course, always been passionate remainers who genuinely believe Brexit is a terrible self-inflicted disaster that will make their country poorer. And there are others who might also believe this, but who certainly did see remain as a useful means of undermining the Labour leadership and driving a wedge between it and its members and voters. One People\u2019s Vote insider tells me \u201cthere was a real Labour-hating atmosphere\u201d at the start, and that Baldwin\u2019s arrival in the summer of 2018 made a difference in challenging that. \u201cWhen some of us pointed out, \u2018You\u2019re not going to win this without Labour,\u2019\u201d they tell me, \u201cthe answer was always, \u2018You would say that, you\u2019re a Labour supporter.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn part, People\u2019s Vote became a refuge and a means to regain relevance for those exiled from frontline politics by Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s assumption of the Labour leadership. The picture painted to me by insiders is one of huge egos with no accountability.\n\nRemain is now a political identity that will shape Britain long after Brexit | Rafael Behr Read more\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an unaccountable elite in this country who exert influence which is totally disproportionate to [their] talent, because they have the funds and connections,\u201d is how the ardent remain campaigner and Momentum national organiser Laura Parker puts it to me. For many of this faction, remain was a convenient means of promoting a political realignment that would displace Labour as the main opposition party.\n\nIn an increasingly likely December election, they would like to use the People\u2019s Vote apparatus principally to aid the efforts of the Liberal Democrats who \u2013 ironically \u2013 have abandoned a second referendum in favour of revoking article 50. Another suspicion put to me is that choosing such a critical week to defenestrate the People\u2019s Vote leadership is about abandoning the cause of stopping Brexit in favour of a \u201crejoin\u201d campaign once Britain has left. This would be the clearest case yet of some using the campaign as a political entity that is less about democracy (a final say now we know more about the nature of Brexit) and more as a vehicle for centrism now the Labour party has been lost to Corbyn.\n\nHundreds of thousands have sacrificed their free time to march and campaign against Brexit. People\u2019s Vote has many dedicated staff who truly believe in their cause. Of course, Labour still has a case to answer: it should have pivoted earlier than it did to back a new referendum. But Britain\u2019s remainers have been ill-served by self-interested, elite power players who always had other motives. They have helped crater Labour\u2019s support, contributing to a division in the anti-Tory vote which may yet hand Johnson the majority he craves, but has not \u2013 as you may have noticed \u2013 stopped Brexit in its path.\n\nAnd if Labour forms a government after an election \u2013 the only plausible route to the referendum the People\u2019s Vote campaign exists to promote \u2013 and if this faction is central to the remain campaign, we might as well skip the hassle and declare defeat in advance.\n\n\u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist", "description": "With the UK edging ever closer to Brexit, the organisation campaigning for a second referendum is riven with conflict, says Guardian columnist Owen Jones", "authors": ["Owen Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b8d097055c2211d923752ab7d62007fbad0d2a0/0_33_3744_2246/master/3744.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=a7864419ea88aa82d0516183e48616b1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
