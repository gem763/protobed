Adam Schiff (D-CA), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, which is overseeing investigations against President Donald Trump, for what he called a \u201cpolitical impeachment.\u201d\n\nNPR sent out its public editor, Elizabeth Jensen, to defend the taxpayer-funded left-wing media outlet for it \u201cjournalistically strong\u201d coverage of the impeachment effort after its supporters criticized an interview with Rep. Jim Banks (R-IN):\n\nUnlike some of the critics, I think that overall the coverage has the handling of misinformation in an interview on Wednesday\u2019s All Things Considered with Rep. Jim Banks, an Indiana Republican, raised journalistic concerns that I don\u2019t think are explained away as purely partisan posturing (although there has also been plenty of partisan pushback from both sides about the interview). And once again, the journalistic challenge resulted from a format choice: the decision to interview a politician on live radio. Live interviews have increased greatly on NPR\u2019s newsmagazines in recent years. As readers of this column well know, listeners (and I) have raised many concerns about their execution. When they work, live interviews are a valuable way to hear the point of view of a newsmaker in their own words. An interview runs into problems, however, when the guest says something that is provably inaccurate or seriously misleading. At that point the host is obligated to push back to correct it, which to some listeners sounds partisan (and it can be unpleasant and unproductive when an interview turns argumentative).\n\nEven before Jensen was tapped to defend NPR, host Michel Martin added commentary at the end of the transcript of the interview on NPR\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cWe feel we must note that Congressman Banks did not accurately describe The New York Times reporting about Congressman Schiff and the whistleblower\u2019s complaint,\u201d Martin said. \u201cThe Times quoted a spokesman for Congressman Schiff who said Schiff never saw any part of the complaint or knew precisely what the whistleblower would deliver.\u201d\n\nThis despite, as Breitbart News reported, that the Washington Post called out Schiff for his dishonesty:\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s \u201cFact Checker\u201d column hit House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) with four Pinocchios Friday for falsely claiming that his panel had \u201cnot spoken directly\u201d with the partisan CIA officer behind a so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint about President Donald Trump.\n\nJensen\u2019s defense included that NPR has gotten \u201cregular complaints\u201d about its coverage of the impeachment story, which critics say is \u201cheavily tilted toward Democratic viewpoints.\u201d But Jensen blamed Republicans for that: \u201cRepublicans have been ducking interviews with NPR.\u201d\n\nAnd Jensen doubled down on Schiff being honest about how the whistleblower complaint unfolded, despite the fact that it was confirmed by his own staff that the whistleblower was in touch with the Intelligence Committee before he or she filed their complaint.\n\nIn fact, one NPR staffer defended the Banks interview.\n\n\u201cWe invited the Congressman on\u201d to represent the defense of the president, Terence Samuel, NPR\u2019s deputy managing editor said, \u201cand I think he did a good job of it.\u201d\n\nAnd he backed the decision to \u201ccorrect\u201d Banks interview \u201crather than pulling the whole thing.\u201d\n\nBut Jensen disagreed: \u201cI respectfully disagree with how this was handled. Letting the statements stand on rebroadcast, with only an unlabeled correction at the end, in effect retained the original misinformation and thus could not help but confuse listeners. Even the transcript of the interview on the website can be confusing for the same reason.\u201d\n\nJensen concluded by advocating for less live interviews in favor of pre-taped interviews, which can be edited.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter @PennyStarrDC", "description": "NPR regrets a live radio interview with a Republican lawmaker who called out Rep.
