The U.S. Can Get It Back.", "language": "en", "text": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Russia, President Barack Obama taunted in 2014, was a \u201cregional power\u201d: a country capable of making mischief in its neighborhood, but not of projecting global influence. It wouldn\u2019t be surprising if in the last two weeks, Russian President Vladimir Putin has chuckled at the memory of that jibe.\n\nRussian mercenaries now occupy positions in Syria held just days ago by U.S. forces \u2014 a symbol of the collapse of America\u2019s position in the region and Moscow\u2019s ascendance as the key power broker in the Syrian civil war. Meanwhile, Putin conducted a state visit to the United Arab Emirates (as part of a larger trip to the Persian Gulf), where Russian flags lined the streets upon his arrival. Russia now possesses greater influence in the Middle East than at any time since the height of Soviet power in the 1960s. Not bad for a country that has an economy the size of a middling European power.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to remember that only a few years ago, Moscow\u2019s sole ally in the region - Bashar al-Assad\u2019s Syrian regime \u2013 was tottering; it looked like Moscow was about to get pushed out of the region altogether. When Putin intervened militarily in Syria in 2015, Obama predicted that Russian forces would soon get stuck in a quagmire. It hasn\u2019t turned out that way.\n\nMoscow, in partnership with Iran and its proxies, has made itself the centerpiece of the diplomacy and regional power struggles surrounding that conflict. To what other capital would both Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Qassem Soleimani, the commander of Iran\u2019s Quds Force, trek to discuss Middle Eastern security?\n\nThe Kremlin also enjoys growing military and political ties with countries throughout the region in addition to the UAE, including U.S. partners such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Turkey\u2019s recent purchase of Russian military hardware \u2014 the advanced S-400 air-defense system \u2014 is threatening to fracture NATO. Moscow has even entered the fray in the Libyan civil war, by supporting the rebel forces of General Khalifa Haftar, who happens to hold U.S. citizenship.\n\nPutin has done a great deal to engineer this Middle Eastern revival. He has compensated for Russia\u2019s comparative lack of power by using low-cost tools \u2014 air power, mercenaries, support for proxies \u2014 to achieve outsize impact in Syria. He has also been willing to accept relatively high risks, such as putting Russian pilots, advisers, and Special Forces in the middle of this war, on the calculation that Moscow\u2019s rivals \u2014 namely the U.S. \u2014 would be more cautious.\n\nAt the same time, Putin has shown diplomatic flexibility, keeping the lines open to nearly all players throughout the region. He has adhered to the dictum that countries have no permanent friends or enemies, only permanent interests, by repairing relations with Turkey \u2014 frayed by the shootdown of a Russian fighter jet in 2015 \u2014 and using Ankara\u2019s disaffection with Washington to weaken NATO. He has exploited one of the resources that the Middle East produces in abundance \u2013 chaos - to thrust Russia into imbroglios like the one in Libya.\n\nYet Putin wouldn\u2019t have achieved nearly as much were it not for another critical asset: his ability to capitalize on American mistakes, and to cultivate a reputation for decisiveness just as many Arab regimes, from Egypt to the Gulf, have grown worried about America\u2019s reliability.\n\nThere would not have been an opportunity for Russian meddling in Libya, for example, had the U.S. and its allies not left behind a disastrous security vacuum after overthrowing the Muammar Qaddafi regime in 2011. Similarly, Russia\u2019s emergence as a central player in Syria began not in 2015, but in 2013, when Obama carelessly drew a \u201cred line\u201d against the use of chemical weapons by Assad\u2019s military, declined to enforce that red line when it was breached, and then had to turn to Moscow to broker a face-saving agreement to defuse the crisis.\n\nIn 2015, Putin could turn the tide of the civil war and embarrass Washington in the process because the Obama administration had created an enormous gap between its stated policy and its actual policy: It had publicly set an objective, regime change, that it never wanted to pay the costs of achieving. And now, Russia\u2019s triumph in northern Syria was possible because the Trump administration abandoned a position it was holding at relatively low cost, thereby precipitating the upheaval that Moscow exploited.", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Russia, President Barack Obama taunted in 2014, was a \u201cregional power\u201d: a country capable of making mischief in its neighborhood, but not of projecting global influence.
