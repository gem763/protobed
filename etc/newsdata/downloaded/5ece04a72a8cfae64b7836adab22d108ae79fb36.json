It\u2019s dedicated to helping spread awareness to various musicians, engineers, and other artists who contribute to popular music but often go unrecognized by the broader culture.\n\nAs part of the campaign, the Recording Academy has enlisted popular artists like Anderson .Paak, Billie Eilish, and Diplo to participate by creating a \u201ccredit cover\u201d image and sharing it across public social media posts to help bring recognition to the people behind the scenes who made artists\u2019 work possible.\n\nThe campaign is dedicated to giving credit to every person who contributed to a track\n\nAs part of this campaign, the Recording Academy has partnered with Australian music metadata and authentication company Jaxsta, which boasts more than 100 million officially sourced credits from music labels and distributors across its database. Jaxsta effectively compiles full song credits \u2014 who played the saxophone on one track or which engineers contributed to the production on another \u2014 and makes it easy to source that info, be it for sample clearance, industry analytics, or initiatives like Behind the Record.\n\n\u201cWe are proud to be the data partner for the Recording Academy\u2019s \u2018Behind the Record\u2019 campaign as it aligns perfectly with Jaxsta\u2019s mission to give credit to the talented people who create the music we love,\u201d Jacqui Louez Schoorl, Jaxsta\u2019s co-founder and CEO, said in a statement.\n\nMusic metadata, which, in theory, should contain all of the underlying credit information for a track, has been an ongoing issue for the music industry in the streaming age. Technical roadblocks to syncing this data across various industry databases have resulted in artists and other key figures in the creation process of music not getting properly compensated for their work.\n\nHere\u2019s how The Verge\u2019s Dani Deahl described the problem in a feature published earlier this year, titled \u201cMetadata is the biggest little problem in the music industry\u201d:\n\nIn the music world, metadata most commonly refers to the song credits you see on services like Spotify or Apple Music, but it also includes all the underlying information tied to a released song or album, including titles, songwriter and producer names, the publisher(s), the record label, and more. That information needs to be synchronized across all kinds of industry databases to make sure that when you play a song, the right people are identified and paid. And often, they aren\u2019t.\n\nThe music industry is starting to do something about it, thanks to campaigns like Behind the Record and firms like Jaxsta, which, as of this summer, now includes tracks from Merlin, Warner Music, Sony Music, and Universal Music Group. The Recording Academy\u2019s \u201ccredit covers\u201d can be easily created on its website by any artist, and they resize automatically to include every person who contributed to the track.\n\nThe Behind the Record campaign arrives just a day after fellow Jaxsta partner Pandora launched its full music credits feature, so users on the web or those using its desktop app can click through on a song to see full credits for what Pandora says is \u201cmillions of tracks.\u201d", "description": "The Recording Academy, the professional association that puts on the Grammy Awards, has launched a new campaign that it\u2019s calling Behind the Record.
