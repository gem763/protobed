And I would never see anybody who looked different, or was maybe male,\u201d she said. \u201cSo for me, it was about pushing diversity and inclusivity with this makeup line, because I wanted to make my makeup not for myself now as a woman \u2014 I wanted to make makeup for myself when I was 16 and I was a boy.\u201d\n\nGorgeous also told a story about what it was like to be a boy getting started in the YouTube beauty space.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s not a thing to be like, \u2018Oh my God, it\u2019s a boy in makeup,'\u201d Gorgeous said. \u201cWhen I started in my previous gender, I was a boy in makeup. I was doing YouTube and I was really sharing my story. I was in high school, I was going through it, I was being bullied, I was very different. Nobody was even doing YouTube. So that\u2019s a group I\u2019m really glad has come out, because it\u2019s showing a lot of people, you\u2019re not alone, you\u2019re not that different. You\u2019re talented, you shouldn\u2019t be pointed and gawked at, you should be applauded for being creative and putting yourself out there.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: Power Women Summit 2019: Follow the Live Blog\n\nTheWrap\u2019s 2019 Power Women Summit takes place on October 24 and 25 at the Fairmont Hotel in Santa Monica.
