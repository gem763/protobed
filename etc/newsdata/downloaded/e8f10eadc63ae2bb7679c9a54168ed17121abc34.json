The Joker is usually presented as Batman\u2019s archenemy, a garish and gleeful purveyor of nihilistic violence who lives to provoke his do-gooder rival. But in Joker, Batman isn\u2019t a presence at all (though a younger version of his alter ego, Bruce Wayne, is). Instead, the director Todd Phillips positions the Joker as an antihero, an evil figure who nonetheless becomes an avatar of vigilante justice within the film.\n\nPhillips has pushed back against the notion that his movie could be blamed for any real-life violence. \u201cWe\u2019re making a movie about a fictional character in a fictional world, ultimately, and your hope is that people take it for what it is,\u201d he told Vanity Fair. \u201cYou can\u2019t blame movies for a world that is so fucked up that anything can trigger it.\u201d Phoenix walked out of one interview when he was asked whether Joker might inspire copycat behavior; in another, the actor said, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the responsibility of a filmmaker to teach the audience morality or the difference between right or wrong.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a fair point, and Joker is hardly the first movie in history to focus on a disturbing antihero. Much of the unease over this particular film seems rooted in two disconnected things: first, the specific online fandom for the Joker character as a standard-bearer for rage, and second, the horrific Aurora shooting, which took place at a screening of the Batman movie The Dark Knight Rises. A persistent rumor, attributed to then\u2013New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, is that the shooter, James Holmes, was dressed up as the Joker and referred to himself as such when he was taken into custody.\n\nBut it isn\u2019t true, as George Brauchler, the Colorado district attorney who prosecuted Holmes, has repeatedly pointed out. According to Brauchler, Holmes picked a Dark Knight Rises screening only because it was the big blockbuster being released that weekend. Still, the link between a major Batman movie and the shooting has endured in the public memory, to the extent that the families of Aurora victims have commented on the release of Joker.\n\n\u201cWhen we learned that Warner Bros. was releasing a movie called Joker that presents the character as a protagonist with a sympathetic origin story, it gave us pause,\u201d read their letter to the studio. \u201cWe want to be clear that we support your right to free speech and free expression. But as anyone who has ever seen a comic-book movie can tell you: With great power comes great responsibility. That\u2019s why we\u2019re calling on you to use your massive platform and influence to join us in our fight to build safer communities with fewer guns.\u201d", "description": "Even before its release, the film has sparked debate for two main reasons: the online fandom inspired by the character and fears of possible gun violence.", "authors": ["David Sims"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/rev_1_JOK_14466_High_Res_JPEG/facebook.jpg?1570051855"}
