A conservative group estimated Medicare for all would cost about $33 trillion over a decade, but Sanders has said that amount is inflated.\n\nWhen pressed by Harwood about where he would get the other half of the funding, Sanders said he was confident the plan would be fully paid for.\n\n\u201cAll that I\u2019m saying is that we have laid out a variety of options that are progressive. We\u2019ll have that debate,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cAt the end of the day, we will pay for every nickel of Medicare for All, and it will save the overwhelming majority of the American people, who will no longer pay premiums.\u201d\n\nMedicare for all supporters say that while taxes may increase, the plan would save most Americans money in the long term by using the federal government to force health care providers to lower prices.", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Sen.
