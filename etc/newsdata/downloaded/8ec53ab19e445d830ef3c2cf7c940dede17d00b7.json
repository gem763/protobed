How dare you?\u201d she said. \u201cYou have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words, and yet, I\u2019m one of the lucky ones. People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing.\u201d\n\nThunberg grew tearful, as she continued to condemn what she sees as the lack of action on part of leaders around the world to halt climate change. \u201cWe are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you?\u201d\n\nThe 2019 Climate Action Summit kicked off at the UN on Monday, where world leaders gathered to discuss serious strategies to mitigate climate change. Representatives of participating nations were told by U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres to come up with \u201cconcrete, realistic plans\u201d to further their commitments to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and get to net zero emissions by 2050.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

But no matter how sad and angry I am, I do not want to believe that,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause if you really understood the situation and still kept on failing to act, then you would be evil, and that I refuse to believe.\u201d\n\nThunberg spoke at the UN following her appearance at the Global Climate Strike in New York City on Friday where she addressed the crowd of protestors, saying, \u201cOur house is on fire. We will do everything in our power to stop this crisis from getting worse.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to the world leaders at the climate summit Monday, Thunberg echoed her earlier message and offered a warning. \u201cYou are failing us. But young people are starting to understand your betrayal. The eyes of all future generations are upon you, and if you choose to fail us, I say, we will never forgive you. We will not let you get away with this.\u201d\n\nWrite to Mahita Gajanan at mahita.gajanan@time.com.", "description": "In a speech at the UN Climate Action Summit, teen Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg appealed to world leaders about climate change.", "authors": ["Mahita Gajanan"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/greta-thunberg-un-climate-summit.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
