For me, the book of the year \u2014 the one title any serious horror reader needs to own \u2014 is Thomas Tessier\u2019s massive retrospective, \u201cWorld of Hurt,\u201d which assembles 28 stories and novellas from a quietly distinguished 40-year career. Each story in this collection resonates. Each, without exception, is chilling, unsettling and beautifully composed. Tessier is one of the genre\u2019s reigning masters, and \u201cWorld of Hurt\u201d may prove to be the centerpiece of his legacy.\n\nOverall, 2019 was a particularly strong year for dark fiction collections. Here\u2019s a much-too-quick look at some of the best. Joe Hill\u2019s generous second collection, \u201cFull Throttle,\u201d offers 13 varied tales that, at their best, have the impact of compact novels. A particular favorite is the collaborative chiller \u201cIn the Tall Grass,\u201d recently filmed by Netflix. In only two slender collections, Nathan Ballingrud has emerged as one of the field\u2019s most accomplished short story writers. His latest collection is \u201cWounds: Six Stories From the Borders of Hell,\u201d and it lives up to the title. The novella \u201cThe Visible Filth,\u201d in which a lost cellphone leads a New Orleans bartender to a horrific denouement, has recently been made into a film titled \u201cWounds.\u201d The always reliable John Langan weighed in with his third and best collection to date, \u201cSefira and Other Betrayals.\u201d The title piece, a short novel about a woman\u2019s cross-country pursuit of the sexual succubus who has upended her life, is a beautifully crafted gem. Paul Tremblay, one of modern horror\u2019s rising stars, gave us his first collection, \u201cGrowing Things,\u201d which features both independent narratives and stories that connect directly to Tremblay\u2019s earlier work, such as the Stoker Award-winning \u201cA Head Full of Ghosts.\u201d Richard Chizmar\u2019s \u201cThe Long Way Home\u201d offers nearly 500 pages of consistently readable horror and suspense, with an occasional piece of nonfiction for variety. \u201cSong for the Unraveling of the World\u201d is Brian Evenson\u2019s latest collection of enigmatic, superbly rendered slices of fear, uncertainty and paranoia. Finally, we have F. Paul Wilson\u2019s \u201cSecret Stories.\u201d Over the course of many years, novels and stories, Wilson has been elaborating a complex secret history of the world. This new collection, which ranges from post-World War I Germany to the New Jersey Pine Barrens, serves as an ideal point of entry to that world.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHorror novels also made an impressive showing in 2019. Two of the most prominent, Stephen King\u2019s \u201cThe Institute,\u201d Elizabeth Hand\u2019s \u201cCurious Toys\u201d and Stephen Chbosky\u2019s \u201cImaginary Friend,\u201d have been addressed elsewhere, but here are a few of the year\u2019s other notable entries. Chuck Wendig\u2019s massive \u201cWanderers\u201d concerns the outbreak of a sleepwalking plague whose cause and purpose remain obscure. Comparisons to King\u2019s \u201cThe Stand\u201d are inevitable, but ultimately beside the point. The book\u2019s nearly 800 pages fly effortlessly by and offer both first-class entertainment and a clear-eyed view of the forces dividing contemporary society. As I finished this one, I found myself thinking: Where has this guy been all my life?\n\nOne of the most anticipated \u2014 and high risk \u2014 projects of the year comes, once again, from Richard Chizmar. \u201cGwendy\u2019s Magic Feather\u201d is a novel-length sequel to \u201cGwendy\u2019s Button Box,\u201d a novella written in collaboration with Stephen King and set in the heart of King\u2019s fictional backyard: Castle Rock, Maine. Both volumes deal with Gwendy Peterson\u2019s stewardship of a doomsday machine, and Chizmar carries the tale forward into Gwendy\u2019s future with sympathy and grace. The result is at once an independent creation and a particularly intimate form of collaboration, one that could have gone badly wrong. But Chizmar\u2019s voice and sensibility dovetail neatly with King\u2019s own distinctive style, and the book ultimately reads like a newly discovered chapter in King\u2019s constantly evolving fictional universe.\n\nOne of the most heartening developments of recent years has been the reemergence of Britain\u2019s Kim Newman and of his signature creation, the Anno Dracula novels. The series, which began in the early 1990s and now extends to six volumes (plus a graphic novel), is based on the premise that Van Helsing and company, heroes of Bram Stoker\u2019s original novel, failed to defeat Dracula, ushering in an alternate world in which Dracula is ascendant, and vampirism has taken hold across the world. The latest installment, \u201cAnno Dracula 1999: Daikaiju,\u201d takes place in Tokyo on the eve of the millennium and is as readable and ingenious as any of the previous volumes. In addition to publishing the Anno Dracula novels, Titan Books has also reissued the bulk of Newman\u2019s earlier work, which includes \u201cThe Quorum,\u201d a brilliant account of a Faustian bargain that goes horribly \u2014 and inevitably \u2014 wrong.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe health of a genre depends, of course, on its ability to attract gifted new writers, and the past year has seen the emergence of several talented first-time novelists. \u201cTinfoil Butterfly,\u201d by Rachel Eve Moulton, is a visceral account of two lost souls \u2014 a desperate young woman and a sexually confused girl \u2014 confronting external dangers and internal pressures in the Black Hills of South Dakota. In \u201cSoon,\u201d Australia\u2019s Lois Murphy posits a world in which an entire community is decimated by lethal forces hiding in the darkness. \u201cThe Killing Moon\u201d by Welsh novelist Allister Timms sets the ancient Germanic legend of the Erl-King against the backdrop of war-torn Europe. Fantasy writer T. Kingfisher\u2019s horror debut, \u201cThe Twisted Ones,\u201d connects contemporary regional horror with the work of the great Welsh fantasist Arthur Machen. Shaun Hamill\u2019s \u201cA Cosmology of Monsters\u201d leads off with the most compelling opening sentence of the year (\u201cI started collecting my older sister Eunice\u2019s suicide notes when I was seven years old\u201d) and goes on to create a seamless merger of horror and family tragedy. With the advent of so many distinctive voices, the current horror renaissance seems likely to continue. The world around us may be spinning out of control, but the future of dark fiction seems bright and secure. I look forward to whatever comes next.\n\nBill Sheehan is the author of \u201cAt the Foot of the Story Tree: An Inquiry Into the Fiction of Peter Straub.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The genre is experiencing a renaissance with quality novels and short stories from new and established authors.", "authors": ["Bill Sheehan"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Df_MxUP-6NIVn2bYYBul0M6JjxI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2VXCMGX2MMI6TAMQNPSN5NLOAE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
