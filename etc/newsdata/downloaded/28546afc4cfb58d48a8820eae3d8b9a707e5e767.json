Anthony Amada, one of the officers on the ground, told Massiah \u201cjust push him off.\u201d\n\nMassiah complied and Amada tased and arrested the teen once he fell. Massiah pushed Torres, who was not injured in the fall, before he had a chance to stand up, and interpreted Amada\u2019s direction as permission, according to an internal report.\n\n\u201cOfficer Massiah admitted it was a poor choice to get on the roof with Mr. Torres, but he felt he had very limited choices when he was in close proximity to Mr. Torres, so he pushed him to the waiting officers below,\u201d the report states.\n\nAmada resigned from the force in June ahead of an Internal Affairs recommendation that he be demoted and fired. While Massiah had no previous disciplinary record, he was facing another excessive force violation and had been suspended for 120 hours over a pursuit in a 2018 case, according to the Sentinel.\n\n\u201cPersonnel who have reached a supervisory position are held to even greater standards than officers or civilian personnel because their guidance, influence and knowledge contribute to the overall success of the department,\" Internal Affairs said in a statement recommending that Amada be fired.", "description": "A Florida police department punished an officer who pushed a teenager off a rooftop by revoking one vacation day and suspending him for eight hours,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/policelinetape11032017getty_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
