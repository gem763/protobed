This is what she has to say to them:\n\n\u201cI knew what you were doing before I even looked. Out of the corner of my eye, a sudden flurry of movement \u2013 a furtive glance confirmed it.\n\nYou were in a school bus in front of me in the traffic, as I crawled my way onto the N1 in Cape Town on Tuesday afternoon. One of you had your face smashed up against the back window, lips grotesque as you dragged your tongue over the glass.\n\nAnother had your hands outstretched in front of you, palms inward, thrusting your pelvis towards them, laughing. And the boy with the shadow of a moustache sprouting on your upper lip \u2013 you held two fingers open in front of your mouth, flicking your tongue between them.\n\nMy reaction was well-rehearsed. It\u2019s the same thing I do when men catcall me in the street, when a drunken stranger paws my bottom as he brushes past me in a bar.\n\nIgnore them. Pretend this isn't happening.\n\nYou were making such a scene that the drivers around me noticed too. I received a sympathetic glance from the woman on my right.\n\nThe man on my left frowned slightly, then fixed his gaze determinedly on the steering wheel.\n\nBut as I shifted uncomfortably in my seat, eyes darting everywhere but my front windscreen, my blood began to boil.\n\nWhy do women do this? Pretend this lewd, revolting thing isn\u2019t happening?\n\nREAD MORE: Here are 5 apps developed to help keep women safe\n\nYou can\u2019t have been more than 15. But you made me feel small. You made me feel powerless. And that\u2019s not okay.\n\nSo is ignoring you, allowing you to think there are no repercussions for treating a woman in that way, the answer?\n\nAnd when does it stop? We ignore the catcalls, brush off the unwanted hands \u2013 \u201cboys will be boys\u201d \u2013 and when things go further than that, we blame ourselves. We blame the women.\n\n\u201cI must have been leading him on.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was wearing a short skirt.\u201d\n\nAs these thoughts flowered in my head, and you tried to catch my attention by bashing on the window and thrusting your crotches at me all the more vigorously, I did what any self-respecting journalist would do.\n\nI took a photo.\n\nYou were all surprised at first. One of you, the initial pelvis-thruster I think, looked scared. Eyes wide, you whipped around and flopped back down into your seat.\n\nThe other two of you clearly thought this was hilarious. And you redoubled your air-humping, window-licking efforts.\n\nUnfortunately, the photo didn\u2019t come out great. You won\u2019t be able to make out any of your faces. But maybe someone will recognise the bus, or remember you were coming back from a hockey match or something in the CBD. Maybe someone will know who you are.\n\nREAD MORE: #AmINext hashtag reveals the fear and anxiety SA women have to live with and it's terrifying\n\nAnd I really, really hope this letter finds its way back to your mom, or your dad, or someone you look up to.\n\nAnd I hope they sit you down and try to make you understand that a woman is not an object, or a piece of meat. And that you hold no power over them.\n\nI hope that one day you meet a wonderful woman and fall in love, and you treat her like an equal. That you have children with her. That you teach your son that a woman isn't an object, or a piece of meat. And that he holds no power over them.\n\nI hope you have a daughter, and that you teach her that no man has a right to make her feel small.\n\nAnd make sure she knows that no man has the right to make her feel powerless\u201d\n\n*Not her real name\n\nThis story was submitted to YOU and has been minimally edited.
