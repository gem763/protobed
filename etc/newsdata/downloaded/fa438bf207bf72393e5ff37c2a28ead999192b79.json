But Israeli media have been dominated by critics from all parts of Israel\u2019s fractious political spectrum worried that American dependability is cracking at a volatile moment in the region.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTrump abandons allies without blinking and Israel is liable to be next,\u201d said a commentary in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper. \u201cThe entire balance of power in the Middle East is built on a very delicate web of supports, pressures, understandings and agreements \u2014 and Trump is unraveling that web.\u201d\n\nThe Kurds are viewed here as long-standing allies of Israel, a reliable, moderate pro-Western group that has fought on Israel\u2019s side in multiple conflicts, most recently in the battle against Islamic State militants in Syria. Many Jews here express a kinship with the Kurds, whom they view as a stateless ethnic group persecuted by their common foes, including Iran, Syria and Turkey.\n\n\u201cThe world was silent during the Holocaust and was silent when the Armenian people were massacred and did not recognize it,\u201d said Yaakov Margi, an ultra-Orthodox member of the Israeli Knesset, or parliament. \u201cIt is silent today to the slaughter of the Kurdish people by a tyrant who is never satiated.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPoliticians from several parties condemned Turkey\u2019s incursion and called for Israel to help the Kurds. A group of 50 reserve combat officers in the Israeli military signed an open letter to Netanyahu beseeching him to \u201cdo everything possible to prevent a massacre of the Kurdish people.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu, who highlighted his close relationship with Trump during the recent Israeli election campaign, had no public reaction to the withdrawal until after the Yom Kippur holiday. On Thursday, hours after the Turkish offensive began, he released a statement condemning the attack and promising humanitarian aid for the fleeing Kurds. He made no mention of Trump or the withdrawal of U.S. troops that proceeded the offensive.\n\nInstead, speaking at a Yom Kippur commemoration and repeating his frequent warnings about threats emanating from Iran, Netanyahu struck a note of self-sufficiency: \u201cWe will always remember and implement the basic rule that has guided us; Israel will defend itself, by itself, against any threat.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s surprise move came at a delicate moment for Netanyahu, who is struggling to break a political deadlock following inconclusive national elections last month. For years, Netanyahu has reveled in his reputation as a Trump whisperer, able to wheedle long-sought concessions from the unpredictable president. The prime minister has welcomed the move of the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, shattering decades of U.S. policy, and a presidential proclamation recognizing Israel\u2019s sovereignty over the disputed Golan Heights that Trump signed a month before parliamentary elections in the spring.\n\nNow, with just weeks remaining to negotiate a governing coalition, the ties to Trump that Netanyahu had trumpeted with billboards of the two of shaking hands are widely seen as a liability. The prime minister is a \u201clone rider on a paper tiger,\u201d said a headline in the Haaretz newspaper.\n\n\u201cHe ran his campaign as a man in another league who had mastered the delicate diplomacy of this moment,\u201d said Dan Shapiro, former U.S. ambassador to Israel and research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv. \u201cThis definitely weakens the argument.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIsrael would have objected to the withdrawal of U.S. troops under any circumstances, Shapiro said. But to have such a major policy shift dropped without notice \u2014 catching even Pentagon and State Department officials unaware \u2014 has baffled policymakers here.\n\n\u201cThe chaos just adds to it,\u201d said Shapiro. \u201cThey know they can\u2019t criticize Trump because of the blowback they know would follow. They\u2019re stuck.\u201d\n\nIsrael had already grown wary of Trump\u2019s inconsistency, particularly over his willingness to potentially engage with Iran. Nothing has been more pleasing to Israeli hawks than Trump\u2019s hard line on Tehran, especially his withdrawal from a 2015 international deal that restricted Iran\u2019s nuclear energy program in return for the lifting of economic sanctions.,Netanyahu derided the agreement as weak and ineffective.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut many here began to question Trump\u2019s resolve in June when he reportedly canceld a plan to strike Iranian targets in retaliation for Iran\u2019s downing of a U.S. intelligence drone, likening it to President Barack Obama\u2019s failure to follow through on threats to punish Syria for using chemical weapons in 2013.\n\nMore recently, Washington declined to strike back at Iran following attacks on Saudi Arabian oil installations \u2014 drone and missile strikes that were widely pinned on Tehran. Trump has also seemed more open to talks with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani that French President Emmanuel Macron has tried to broker. Increasingly, Israel frets that the American president\u2019s commitment to the region is waning.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that tomorrow we will have a defense problem because the Americans have left northern Syria,\u201d said Amos Yadlin, former chief of Israeli military intelligence. \u201cIt goes to the role of America as a superpower in the Middle East. If the Americans leave, it\u2019s easier for Iran, it\u2019s easier for [Syrian President] Bashar al-Assad, it\u2019s easier for Hezbollah. All of these are our enemies.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump has defended his Syrian pullout, tweeting that it was time to \u201cget out of these ridiculous endless wars, many of them tribal.\u201d That was small comfort to Israelis who worry that their conflict will be the next one to exhaust the patience of a mercurial president.\n\n\u201cWhile betraying the Kurds, the president also gave a sign of what might be his next betrayal \u2014 when he concluded by saying that the Kurds and Turkey were like Israel and the Palestinians,\u201d analyst Orly Azoulay wrote in Yedioth Ahronoth. \u201cIn other words, a bunch of Middle Eastern nuisances, ungrateful egoists waging tribal wars and sucking American taxpayers\u2019 money.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said little, as politicians and military officers plead for Israel to help the Kurds.", "authors": ["Steve Hendrix", "Jerusalem Bureau Chief Steve Hendrix Has Written For Foreign", "National", "Local", "Most Other Sections Of The Post."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/9zxYlnVsdDrRk-q5Sq9YHgVmBWE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3MCLC6XMEEI6THDNINVA35HTDU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
