Doesn't mean I that hate my country, it means I want to address things,\" Kerr said. \"People in China didn't ask me about, you know, people owning AR-15s and mowing each other down in a mall. I wasn't asked that question.\"\n\n\"We can play this game all we want and go all over the map,\" he continued. \"The world is a complex place and there's more gray than black and white.\"\n\nSteve Kerr on if he's ever been asked about human rights during his previous trips to China:\n\n\n\n\"No. Nor has (America's) record of human rights abuses come up either...
