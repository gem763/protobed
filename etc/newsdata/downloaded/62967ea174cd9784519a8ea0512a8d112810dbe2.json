Do we know what that is? Yeah... a Freddy Krueger in the room, if you will. I didn't know that we have to bring our own mace and rape whistles to Actor's Hour.\"\n\nIn a video uploaded on Instagram, she was booed by what sounded like to be a couple of men in the audience, one of them telling her to \"shut up.\"\n\nRONAN FARROW 'BEHAVES LIKE A TERRORIST,' NBCUNIVERSAL EXEC REPORTEDLY SAYS\n\n\"This kills at group therapy for rape survivors,\" Bachman reacted. \"They love it.\"\n\nShe continued, \"I have been raped, surprisingly, by no one in this room.
