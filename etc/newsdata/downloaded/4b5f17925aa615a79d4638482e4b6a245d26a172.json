CVS Health Corp. says it plans to offer a new layer of coverage specifically for gene therapies, which would handle employers\u2019 costs above a certain threshold. Anthem Inc. said it is looking at special insurance setups to help employers protect themselves from the financial impact of the drugs.\n\nRising Payments Spending on gene therapies is projected to grow 25-fold between 2019 and the end of 2024. Annual U.S. sales, gene therapies $10 billion Luxturna 8 Zolgensma Other 6 4 $26.97M, Luxturna only 2 0 2018 \u201919 \u201920 \u201921 \u201922 \u201923 \u201924 projected\n\n\u201cYou have all these new products coming to the market at these very high prices,\u201d said Steve Miller, Cigna\u2019s chief clinical officer. \u201cClearly this is a pain point in health care that needs to be solved.\u201d\n\nCigna hasn\u2019t set a fee yet, but Dr. Miller said the company is aiming for it to be less than $1.00 per member a month.\n\nThe protection plans are limited so far, and it isn\u2019t clear that the insurers will be able to bring down the overall costs of the therapies, as opposed to simply spreading them out. Insurers say they are pushing for deals that tie payments for gene therapies and other high-cost medicines to their results in patients.\n\nDrugmakers, for their part, say they are open to working with insurers on new payment arrangements that improve patient access to their products.\n\nDrug pricing is complicated and secretive. WSJ explains how the flow of money, drugs and rebates behind the scenes may drive up the price of prescription medicine for consumers.

But their price tags threaten the balance sheets of employers and insurers, especially as more hit the market.\n\nNovartis AG priced Zolgensma, a gene therapy for a muscle-wasting condition known as spinal muscular atrophy, at $2.1 million.\n\nMeantime, Spark Therapeutics Inc. listed Luxturna, which treats a form of inherited vision loss, at $850,000.\n\nIn June, Bluebird Bio Inc. said it would price a new gene therapy for a rare blood disorder at \u20ac1.6 million ($1.8 million) in Europe, where it has been approved.\n\n\u201cEmployers are saying, \u2018I just can\u2019t afford it,\u2019\u201d said CVS Health Chief Medical Officer Troy Brennan.\n\nSo far, health insurers have tried to balance providing patients access to the new therapies with managing their cost partly by setting conditions that limit who can get the drugs.\n\nThe protection plans represent an additional approach. The Cigna program, called Embarc Benefit Protection, will launch with Zolgensma and Luxturna for 2020, and the company aims to add more drugs in the future, Dr. Miller said.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS How should insurers best cover high-priced drug treatments? Join the conversation below.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nEmbarc will administer the review process that decides which patients can get the drugs, and Cigna\u2019s specialty pharmacy can dispense the drugs.\n\nCigna said it wants to accumulate enough clients in the new offering to gain more leverage with the drug companies and wring out better deals for gene therapies. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for money-back guarantees,\u201d said Dr. Miller.\n\nA spokeswoman for AveXis, the Novartis subsidiary that developed Zolgensma, said the company hasn\u2019t been briefed on the new insurance payment plans, but recognizes \u201cinnovative therapies like Zolgensma require innovative solutions for access.\u201d\n\nA Spark spokesman said the company continues to evaluate \u201cways to enhance patient access\u201d to Luxturna with various stakeholders.\n\nCVS\u2019s new offering on gene therapies, for self-insured employers that are clients of the company\u2019s Aetna health insurer, will include Zolgensma and Luxturna and potentially other treatments, Dr. Brennan said. The stop-loss program, which would cover an employer\u2019s costs that exceed a set threshold, will be available for 2020. CVS is also working on a broader reinsurance product for high-cost drugs, he said.\n\nAnthem said it is evaluating reinsurance or stop-loss options that employers could use to shield themselves from the high cost of certain drugs.\n\nThe new options may prove attractive to employers that aren\u2019t big enough to absorb the cost of the new drugs and don\u2019t have existing stop-loss insurance that would cover them, said Nadina Rosier, who is head of the pharmacy practice at advisory firm Willis Towers Watson .\n\nFor companies that already have stop-loss policies that cover such drugs, \u201cYou have to ask yourself, \u2018why am I double paying?\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nInsurers in Massachusetts have been working on a pilot program in which they would forge installment-payment plans for expensive one-time treatments like gene therapy and agree to continue making payments even if patients taking the drug switch insurers.\n\nThe effort has stalled, however, because of drugmaker concerns about Medicaid best-price rules, which require the government program to receive the lowest price of any payer, said Mark Trusheim, strategic director of the New Drug Development Paradigms, a think tank run out of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nAveXis is currently offering a payment option that allows insurers to receive a rebate if the drug doesn\u2019t meet prespecified clinical outcomes for the patient, the company spokeswoman said. The rebate cannot exceed the statutory rebate of 17.1% that drugmakers pay to Medicaid for pediatric drugs, the spokeswoman said.\n\nWrite to Joseph Walker at joseph.walker@wsj.com and Anna Wilde Mathews at anna.mathews@wsj.com", "description": "Cigna and CVS Health are developing new programs to help employers afford gene therapies that can cost more than $2 million.", "authors": ["Joseph Walker", "Anna Wilde Mathews", "Joseph.Walker Wsj.Com", "Anna.Mathews Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104023/social", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
