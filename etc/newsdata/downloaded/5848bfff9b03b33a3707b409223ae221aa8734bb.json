I am going to the Baabda Palace to submit the government\u2019s resignation,\u201d said Hariri, who had already stepped down twice from the same post.\n\nHe said his decision comes \u201cin response to the will of many Lebanese who took to the streets to demand change\u201d.\n\nThe move, the demonstrators\u2019 most significant win yet, will trigger the complicated task of parliament forming a new government \u2014 if the president accepts it.\n\nHariri\u2019s announcement came after days of apparently unfruitful efforts to reshuffle posts within his uneasy coalition, as tension mounted on the ground between protesters and security forces bent on re-opening the country for business.\n\nIt also followed clashes between protestors and counter-demonstrators, which sparked fears of deeper civil strife.\n\nIn his speech on Tuesday, Hariri said he had reached a dead end, urging the political class to protect the country.\n\n\u201cHariri is opening the door to a solution because the resignation is the only way for a decent exit from the current crisis,\u201d said Sami Nader, director of the Levant Institute for Strategic Affairs.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Not enough\u2019 \u2013\n\nAfter Hariri\u2019s announcement, protestors across the country erupted in applause.\n\nHundreds gathered in the northern city of Tripoli \u2014 a stronghold of the Sunni prime minister \u2014 as well as the southern city of Sidon, from where his family hails.\n\nIn Tripoli \u2014 home to festive protest raves \u2014 large crowds gathered in the main al-Nour square waving the Lebanese flag.\n\n\u201cThis resignation is welcome but it is not enough,\u201d said Tima Samir, a 35-year-old mother of two. \u201cWe want the entire system to change.\u201d\n\nIn Sidon\u2019s central square, people sang and danced, as stores gave away free sweets.\n\nAhed Madi, a demonstrator, said the festive scenes in the city were especially symbolic.\n\n\u201cSaad Hariri is from this city and this city has always embraced him. But today, the people want change,\u201d he told AFP.\n\nProtesters have insisted on a complete overhaul of the country\u2019s sectarian-based governance and celebrated the emergence of a national civic identity.\n\n\u2013 Riots \u2013\n\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called Tuesday for Lebanese political leaders to \u201curgently\u201d form a new government.\n\n\u201cThe peaceful demonstrations and expressions of national unity over the last 13 days have sent a clear message. The Lebanese people want an efficient and effective government, economic reform, and an end to endemic corruption,\u201d Pompeo said.\n\nWhile France, one of Hariri\u2019s top allies and Lebanon\u2019s key partner in a crucial $11-billion aid plan, voiced its fears that his resignation \u201cmakes the crisis even more serious\u201d.\n\nLebanon\u2019s Interior Minister Raya al-Hassan said Hariri\u2019s departure was critical to preserving stability.\n\n\u201cThe resignation of prime minister Saad Hariri was necessary to avoid sliding into civil strife whose danger we witnessed today in central Beirut,\u201d she said on Twitter.\n\nPrior to Hariri\u2019s speech on Tuesday, counter-demonstrators attacked protesters at two sites, including at a rally near the government headquarters, AFP reporters said.\n\nThey had chanted slogans hailing the leaders of two Shiite movements \u2014 Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah and Amal head Nabih Berri \u2014 as they pushed roadblocks aside and provoked protesters.\n\n\u201cThere are political orders to attack. This was not spontaneous,\u201d said one demonstrator, alluding to Amal and Hezbollah, neither of which were spared by protesters, including from their own base.\n\nThe protests had otherwise been relatively incident-free, despite tensions with the armed forces and attempts by party loyalists to stage counter-demonstrations.\n\nLebanon\u2019s political leaders have appeared shell-shocked, trying simultaneously to express sympathy for the movement while warning of turmoil in the case of a power vacuum.\n\nHariri last week announced a package of economic reforms which aims to revive an economy that has been on the brink of collapse for months, but the move failed to quell the anger in the street.\n\nIt has often taken months for Lebanon\u2019s fractious political leaders to agree on a government line-up, a scenario Lebanon\u2019s backers say the country can ill afford.", "description": "Beirut (AFP) \u2013 Lebanon\u2019s prime minister submitted his government\u2019s resignation on Tuesday, bowing to nearly two weeks of unprecedented", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/12c557_prime-minister-saad-hariri-announced-his-resignation-lebanese-protesters-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
