The question is: how far will the former lovers go in order to keep their secret hidden?\n\nEarlier this year, Mercedes was going through a tough time and, as a result, she sought solace in Liam. On one particular night, Liam tried to cheer the young woman up by stealing Harry\u2019s (Parry Glasspool) new vehicle \u2014 which was a present from James (Gregory Finnegan) \u2014 and heading out for a joyride. However, during said joyride, an argument broke out, and the lovers ended up knocking down Grace (Tamara Wall).\n\n(Picture: Lime Pictures)\n\nAfterwards, Harry not only became prime suspect in the police investigation, he also became public enemy number one \u2014 with Grace holding him personally responsible. Harry discovered the truth and managed to record Mercedes\u2019 threatening confession, but Breda McQueen (Moya Brady) viciously murdered him before he could use the information he\u2019d procured.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, the truth could well be set to out in the coming episodes, as Joel discovers Harry\u2019s phone and \u2014 upon hearing the recording of Mercedes confessing to the hit-and-run \u2014 he heads to The Dog to play it aloud for the pub manager. Joel informs Mercedes that he\u2019ll give her a chance to tell her family before he goes to the police.\n\nMercedes has went to extreme lengths to protect her family from the truth in the past, so she\u2019ll no doubt do so again in order to keep her secret hidden.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Liam\u2019s relentless when it comes to those he cares about, and if Mercedes informs him of Joel\u2019s revelation, he\u2019ll no doubt pull out all the stops to protect not only himself, but the woman he loves.\n\nWith that in mind, could Liam perhaps murder Joel? It\u2019s certainly a possibility.\n\nIf not, then Mercedes and Liam are in for a whole world of trouble.\n\nOne to watch: Monday 14th October at 7pm on E4.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Is this the end of the road for Joel?", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_86719428_1570309169.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
