Trump and many Republicans argue if the Ukrainians were in the dark, any allegation of wrongdoing by Trump falls apart.\n\n\"You can't have a quid pro quo with no quo,\" Republican Rep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, said in comments tweeted out by Trump on Wednesday.\n\nBut in some 65 hours of testimony \u2014 details of which have been previously reported \u2014 along with public comments from Trump, his aides and allies, a portrait is emerging of a quid pro quo that evolved over time, with the president progressively upping the ante when his demands were not met.\n\nWhat started as a bid to leverage Zelenskiy's hopes for a White House meeting took on added dimensions as the Ukrainian leader mentioned his desire to buy Javelin missiles from the U.S. and Trump, in a separate move, put $391 million in military aid on hold.\n\nThe evolution of Trump's efforts to commit the Ukrainians to investigations that could help his re-election may explain the discrepancies in the accounts given to House investigators about whether Trump ever said explicitly that the freeze in aid was linked to his and Trump personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani's demands \u2014 and to whom he might have said it.\n\nIn the end, he may not have needed to say it out loud.\n\nBoth acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor and former White House official Fiona Hill testified that by early July, the Ukrainians had learned from Trump's emissaries that Zelenskiy wouldn't get a White House visit unless he agreed to Giuliani's demand that he publicly commit to investigate supposed Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election and Burisma, the natural gas company tied to former Vice President Joe Biden's son.\n\nZelenskiy never did commit to the investigations, and wasn't granted his White House visit.\n\nIn the midst of all that, Trump appears to have increased the cost of refusing his demands. He directed that U.S. military assistance scheduled to be delivered to the Ukrainians be unexpectedly held back, as even his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, has acknowledged.\n\nTaylor, in testimony that Democratic lawmakers described as leaving them gasping, discussed hunting for answers from other U.S. officials about why the aid was frozen after learning about it from a budget staffer on a conference call. Taylor said that one White House official \u2014 Alex Vindman \u2014 had told him that Sondland had told a top Zelenskiy aide the money wouldn't flow until Zelenskiy committed to investigate Burisma.\n\nSondland even told Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin the aid was held up until the Ukrainians agreed to the investigation, Johnson told The Wall Street Journal.\n\nIn Sondland's telling, according to the individuals with knowledge of his testimony, that assertion was based on his own speculation that Trump was applying the same conditions to the military assistance that he had to a Zelenskiy meeting \u2014 not on anything Trump explicitly said. In fact, when asked about it separately by both Sondland and Johnson, Trump repeatedly denied there was any quid pro quo, according to Sondland's testimony, text messages given to Congress and a statement from Johnson. Trump has repeated that assertion in public.\n\nTo be sure, the testimony from Sondland \u2014 a political appointee and major donor to Trump's inauguration who calls himself a \"lifelong Republican,\" was in many ways less damning to the president than the testimony from career diplomats like Taylor and former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. The White House has tried to undercut the credibility of their testimony by dismissing them as \"radical unelected bureaucrats.\"\n\nYet even on its own, Sondland's testimony described a tit-for-tat arrangement that meets the basic definition of a quid pro quo. In his deposition, he acknowledged that the conditions were so clear that he and former U.S. envoy for Ukraine talks Kurt Volker conveyed them to the Ukrainians, the individuals said.\n\nStill, Sondland maintained \u2014 to the incredulity of many Democrats \u2014 that he didn't know until much later that Burisma was tied to Biden's son. That assertion and Sondland's claims that he couldn't recall other key moments of interest to House investigators led to significant frustration among Democrats, lawmakers and others briefed on his testimony said.\n\nSpokespersons for the House committees conducting the impeachment inquiry declined to comment.\n\nAs House investigators seek to piece together the president's actions on Ukraine over the last several months, they are dependent on a parade of witnesses who each have only partial visibility into what transpired behind the scenes.\n\nHill and Taylor both testified that the normal channels for conducting diplomacy on Ukraine and keeping relevant officials in the loop were circumvented by Giuliani and a troika of officials deputized by Trump to run a \"shadow\" policy on Ukraine: Sondland, Volker and Energy Secretary Rick Perry.\n\nAnd as text messages among many of those individuals show, even they were left struggling in real time to figure out what was happening from their perches in disparate parts of the world: Taylor in Kyiv, Sondland in Brussels, Perry and Hill in Washington and Volker shuttling back and forth between the United States and Ukraine.\n\nA third possible leverage point \u2014 Javelin anti-tank missiles \u2014 was introduced during Trump's July 25 phone call with Zelenskiy, the call that prompted a whistleblower complaint and ultimately triggered impeachment proceedings.\n\nZelenskiy, according to a memo detailing the call later released by the White House, said Ukraine was \"almost ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes\" against Russian aggression.\n\n\"I would like you to do us a favor, though,\" Trump immediately replied, before asking Zelenskiy to \"find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine.\" He invoked a debunked conspiracy theory about a hacked Democratic National Committee server ending up in Ukraine and also mentioned Biden's son.\n\nBy that time, the $391 million in military aid had already been suspended, although there are no indications the Ukrainians knew that at the time of the Zelenskiy call. Taylor testified that in his meetings with Ukrainian officials in late July and most of August, the Ukrainians appeared unaware of the freeze, although The New York Times reported Wednesday that the Ukrainians were aware by early August.\n\nThe Javelin missiles, though, were separate from the military aid that Trump had quietly suspended in mid-July.\n\nThe $391 million in aid to Ukraine was divided into two buckets to be doled out by the State Department and the Defense Department. The State Department funds, for example, were to be given to Ukraine to then use to buy military equipment from U.S. defense manufacturers.\n\nThe Javelin missiles, on the other hand, were to have been bought by the Ukrainians using their own money, according to a foreign military sale notification from the Trump administration to Congress. That sale \u2014 150 missiles at a cost of $39 million \u2014 was approved earlier this month.\n\nIt's unclear whether Trump, when he responded to Zelenskiy's missile ask by requesting a favor, was aware that Javelins were not part of the aid he'd just suspended.", "description": "After some 65 hours of testimony along with public comments from Trump, his aides and allies, a clear portrait is emerging.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/4259970/1000x563_nbc-191025-donald-trump-ew-432p_971e50c9dbb1b62efb431b2849ec7fa1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
