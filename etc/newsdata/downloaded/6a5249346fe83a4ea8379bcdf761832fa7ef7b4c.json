Trevor Bayliss is no longer England's head coach, departing at the end of the 2019 Ashes after a long summer in which he guided them to World Cup victory. But who could replace the Australian at the helm? Getty Images 2/10 Chris Silverwood England's pace bowling coach guided Essex to the County Championship title in 2017 and is a calming influence who appears to be well-liked by the playing group. He is set to take interim charge for the tour of New Zealand, which could function as an audition of sorts. If England want to keep things in house, Silverwood could fit. Getty Images 3/10 Jason Gillespie A leading contender when Bayliss was appointed, Gillespie is rated highly by the ECB, and the respected Australian has done solid work rebuilding Sussex after a successful previous stint with Yorkshire, where he forged a relationship with Test captain Joe Root. While he has spoken of his desire to stay on with Sussex and the Adelaide Strikers in the Big Bash, an offer may well be extended across the table to test his resolve. Bryn Lennon/Getty Images 4/10 Mickey Arthur If England favour an experienced international coach to keep things ticking over, Arthur may be their man. With spells in charge of his native South Africa, Australia and latterly Pakistan, Arthur might be a somewhat uninspiring choice, but he'd be a steady hand on the tiller. AFP/Getty Images 5/10 Mike Hesson Hesson shockingly stepped down from his job as New Zealand head coach less than 12 months before this summer's World Cup, and recently resigned his position as head coach of the Kings XI Punjab of the IPL to press for the Indian head coaching job. While he narrowly missed out to incumbent Ravi Shastri for that role, it was Hesson who - in tandem with Brendon McCullum - transformed New Zealand cricket after taking charge in 2012 and it was from his and McCullum's blueprint that England built their World Cup winning side. Hesson would be an intriguing choice. Getty Images 6/10 Ottis Gibson South Africa moved on from Gibson this summer after a disappointing World Cup, but he had done a good job with the Proteas, on the whole, guiding them through some tougher times. Well-liked from his two spells as England bowling coach (Stuart Broad has been particularly glowing in his praise of Gibson's guidance), the Barbadian is a solid option. AFP/Getty Images 7/10 Paul Collingwood The vacancy may come a couple of years too soon for Collingwood, but the fact that the steely all-rounder has been injected into the England environment so soon after his playing retirement suggests he is some one the top ECB brass have their eye on. He possesses a strong tactical mind, particularly in white-ball cricket. AFP/Getty Images 8/10 Paul Farbrace Farbrace's departure to Warwickshire ahead of the 2019 summer came as a surprise, for it seemed Bayliss' affable assistant could have been in line for a promotion. He was influential in England's ODI turnaround, and while he now seems an outside bet having not long left the group, he would provide a degree of continuity. Getty Images 9/10 Alec Stewart Stewart appears to be happy at Surrey, but you could not ask for a sager head to guide England onwards. He has overseen a revolution at The Oval, cultivating and nurturing young talent and has considerable cricketing nous, and Stewart's knowledge of the county game would be an asset. Getty Images 10/10 Split coaches? ECB Director of Cricket Ashley Giles could opt to split the role, appointing two coaches - one for white-ball cricket and one for Test matches. Though the practicality of a split arrangement is a little uncertain, it would lessen the intensity of a role that has become extremely demanding. Giles has suggested such a move is unlikely, but it remains an option. Getty Images 1/10 Who could replace Trevor Bayliss?
