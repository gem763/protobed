It has spent over 6 billion reais so far but some victims have complained about the pace of rebuilding efforts.", "description": "Production is expected to resume toward the end of 2020 at less than one third of its previous rate, Vale said.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_190/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7b6a261f2ae16885dab61054d6c31dcfb992f731", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
