And just before [John's] going to move to the United States. The film does touch on why John loved [Yoko] and what their union was. And why Yoko saved John,\" Epstein explained to Fox News.\n\n\"It was more than just a love affair,\" he added. \"You know they were artists who worked together and I think John was able to find his voice through Yoko. She helped him fully realize himself as an artist and I know that a lot of Beatles fans ... hate that notion the idea that she took him from us.\"\n\nAccording to Epstein, work on the film started \"with a phone call from Yoko\" who revealed she and others wanted to \"open the vaults\" and rerelease the music. Epstein described how Ono, now 86 years old, wanted the public to \"get a chance to see John\" again.\n\nEpstein said he had to sift through hundreds and hundreds of hours of raw footage and home movies that contained everything from \"John sitting on the toilet\" to \"this very quiet experimental film that he made that I'd heard rumors about for years.\"\n\nWhile looking through all the footage, Epstein said he discovered a \"quietness to John.\"\n\n\"You got to see the real them, not the person that they are sitting across from a chair or the person that they are in a press conference or in a concert but just him hanging out,\" he added.\n\nPAUL MCCARTNEY'S FIRST MEETING WITH JOHN LENNON BEFORE THE BEATLES WAS 'UNREMARKABLE,' PALS CLAIM\n\nEpstein hopes the audience takes away the same understanding.\n\n\"I think if people can take one thing from [the documentary], it is they get a little bit closer to John,\" he admitted. \"They get a little bit more intimate with John and with Yoko and they understand them and feel them a little bit more.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"John & Yoko: Above Us Only Sky\" is available to stream on Netflix.", "description": "A new documentary is peeling back the curtain on\u00a0the untold story of\u00a0John Lennon's 1971 album, \"Imagine.\"", "authors": ["Jessica Napoli"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/yoko-ono-and-john-lennon-ap-graphics-bank.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
