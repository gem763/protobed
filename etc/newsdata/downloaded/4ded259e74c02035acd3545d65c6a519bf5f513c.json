Under the plan, people driving into Brussels would have to pay a toll, with higher charges for those arriving in peak traffic or in more polluting vehicles.\n\n\u201cEveryone who regularly comes to Brussels knows how bad the congestion is,\u201d Van Den Brandt told Flemish radio. \u201cEveryone who lives or works or visits knows the air quality is very bad, and that we really have to respond to that. The smart kilometer charge provides an answer.\u201d\n\nBut the Green Party minister's plan exacerbates tensions between Brussels, Flanders and Wallonia. That's because the toll is tied to cutting other road use taxes to compensate drivers. People from regions not taking part in the scheme would still have to pay the charge when driving into Brussels, but wouldn't get a tax cut.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m assuming that if Flanders joins the kilometer charge, they\u2019ll lower a number of taxes at the same time in order to make sure that it has an impact on traffic jams, the quality of life and air quality first and foremost ... and to guarantee that the system is fair as well,\u201d Van Den Brandt said.\n\n\u201cA kilometer charge can be a part of the solution on the condition that it's not a tax hike\u201d \u2014 Ben Weyts, Flemish transport minister\n\nThe original idea was for the whole country to agree to the system. The Brussels region's governing parties agreed in a July coalition deal to try to \u201cclinch a cooperation agreement between the regions with a view to introduce a smart kilometer charge for light vehicles.\u201d\n\nPolitical traffic jams\n\nBut that's run into trouble because neither Flanders nor Wallonia have been able to cobble together a government since May's election.\n\nVan Den Brandt maintains that the Brussels government still wants a broader agreement. \u201cWhat we\u2019re hoping is that we can still reach an agreement with Flanders \u2014 because the government is still in the making,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Brussels\u2019 decision to go it alone if necessary has prompted angry reactions from legislators.\n\n\u201cThere is no Flemish or Walloon government yet at this time. Discussion is impossible,\u201d said Cieltje Van Achter, who leads the Flemish nationalist party the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) in the Brussels parliament. \u201cWhat signal is the Brussels government trying to send with this show of force?\u201d\n\nHer fellow N-VA party member, former Migration Secretary Theo Francken, called \u2014 presumably jokingly \u2014 for retaliatory tolls in the Flemish region that surrounds Brussels in a series of tweets, proposing a \u201cZaventem charge,\u201d a \u201cSonian Forest tax\u201d and a \u201cBrabant toll.\u201d\n\nEven if Flanders and Wallonia agree on coalition governments, the regions are still unlikely to agree a common approach on road charging anytime soon. While Flanders and Brussels were mulling a common kilometer charge that would increase levies in peak traffic, the previous Wallonian government advocated a different flat-rate vignette system.\n\nWalloon Transport Minister Carlo Di Antonio has said it would be \u201cdifficult to grasp\u201d having two separate road charging systems in one country.\n\nOutgoing Flemish Transport Minister Ben Weyts, with the N-VA, called the Walloon idea a \u201cstupid charge that doesn\u2019t steer traffic.\u201d\n\nWeyts shelved Flanders\u2019 own long-standing, but rather vague, plans to introduce a charge in the run-up to the May election, after the far-right Vlaams Belang party\u2019s campaign successfully branded it as \u201ctax bullying.\u201d\n\n\u201cA kilometer charge can be a part of the solution on the condition that it's not a tax hike,\u201d Weyts said, defending his decision.\n\nCoalition friction\n\nThe political fight over the road charge in Flanders makes it very difficult for the N-VA to shift position once more.\n\nBut with negotiations on a government for Flanders still ongoing, and the region\u2019s Christian Democrats reportedly still in favor of a toll, Van Den Brandt hasn\u2019t given up hope that Flanders will eventually back a road charge.\n\nVan Den Brandt's plan could run into opposition in the capital's regional parliament. With its first plenary meeting scheduled for mid-September, lawmakers haven't debated the new government's coalition deal yet \u2014 let alone a plan for a toll.\n\nThe idea also hasn't got unanimous backing from her fellow ministers.\n\n\u201cAs long as the Flemish and Walloon governments haven\u2019t been formed, and as long as there haven\u2019t been any consultations, all declarations by members of the Brussels government about this [subject] are premature,\u201d Brussels Finance Minister Sven Gatz, of the Flemish Liberal party, told Knack.", "description": "It puts pressure on Flanders and Wallonia to join in if they want to protect their drivers from road charges.", "authors": ["Hanne Cokelaere"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/h_54685161-1200x628.jpg"}
