Ezeocha first came to the U.S. legally but had since overstayed his visa.\n\nDespite being wanted for bank fraud, money laundering, and felony theft, the sanctuary city of Chicago released Ezeocha into the general public instead of extraditing him to Louisiana, according to Landry.\n\n\u201cThe sanctuary city of Chicago harbored this criminal, and another citizen of Louisiana has unfortunately been victimized by an illegal immigrant,\u201d Landry said in a statement. \u201cI am grateful to our law enforcement partners for working with my office to apprehend Mr. Ezeocha.\u201d\n\nAccording to Landry, Ezeocha was operating out of Chicago when he contacted a U.S. citizen living in Lafayette, Louisiana, claiming to be associated with a company out of New Mexico with which the victim had previously conducted business.\n\nEzeocha, Landry said, ultimately stole more than $22,000 from the Louisiana resident by using a Chicago bank account to route the funds to himself.\n\nThe Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency has placed a detainer on Ezeocha so that if he gets released from prison at any time, he will be turned over to federal immigration officials for arrest and deportation.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
