The big, headline ruling limits the territorial reach of the CNIL\u2019s orders over Google\u2019s internet services. The court held that, while the CNIL can compel Google to remove links to offending material for users located in Europe, it may not currently do so worldwide. This was the key issue that brought so much attention to the case\u2014including the interest of civil society groups and several governments. It was a clear win for Google, even if it was also a setback (more on that in a moment). Then there is the second decision, which received much less attention and involves the handling of \u201csensitive data\u201d\u2014where the court effectively creates a notice-and-delist regime for certain kinds of information, such as health care records, criminal justice records and so on. This second case is also a sort of win for Google, but the implications for operationalization of the second decision are much less clear (Stanford\u2019s Daphne Keller has a helpful breakdown of the ruling).\n\nThere\u2019s much to unpack here, but I thought I would just highlight three things. The first is that Google won the battle: The court concluded that France does not have the current authority to demand that its delisting orders apply around the world. Second, however, Google is losing the larger war against global injunctions: Europe\u2019s highest court explicitly rejected the idea that global orders are inherently problematic or somehow incompatible with a global internet. To the contrary, the court left the door wide open\u2014even put out a welcome mat\u2014for future extraterritorial regulations of the internet. Third, contrary to the general story that Europe views and regulates the internet differently from the U.S., these cases share striking similarities to some of the most pressing regulatory challenges on this side of the Atlantic.\n\nLesson #1: France\u2019s Global Injunction Was Problematic\n\nThe headline takeaway from the case is that France\u2019s injunction ordering Google to remove links to certain material from its search results globally is not valid. In accordance with Europe\u2019s \u201cRight to Be Forgotten\u201d regime, Google had agreed to remove certain offending search results from its search product; the question was just which search products and where? The firm had at least three distinct options:\n\nDomain-level response: Remove the offending listings only from the country-level domain (in this case, google.fr). Location-specific response: Use geolocation technology to identify where the user is located and make sure that users in the relevant jurisdiction (in this case, Europe) do not see links to the offending material. Global takedown: Stop listing to the offending material worldwide.\n\nIn this case, as in others, Google started at domain-level, then was pushed to location-specific, yet the regulators insisted on a global takedown. Google initially removed offending material from its Google.fr page but not from Google.com. After Google convened an advisory council, which recommended that the firm use its geolocation technologies to remove the content from the results seen by users located in France, Google agreed to do that. But the CNIL concluded this wasn\u2019t good enough, insisting that Google remove the offending links on all of its search results wherever they are seen; in short, the CNIL wanted a global injunction.\n\nThe European Court of Justice concluded, however, that the CNIL did not have express authority for such an order under European data protection law (specifically Directive 95/46 and Regulation 2016/679), and even if such authority might be implied, the CNIL did not sufficiently weigh countervailing considerations. The court noted that while the drafters of European privacy law sought to \u201cguarantee a high level of protection of personal data throughout the European Union,\u201d and that global delisting would \u201cmeet that objective in full,\u201d the \u201cright to the protection of personal data is not an absolute right.\u201d Rather, a right to privacy \u201cmust be considered in relation to its function in society and be balanced against other fundamental rights,\u201d including \u201cthe freedom of information of internet users.\u201d The court found that while European privacy law strikes \u201ca balance between that right and that freedom so far as the Union is concerned\u201d (emphasis added), it does not do so for users outside the union. In sum, there was no express EU authorization for the CNIL\u2019s global order, and because the order does not balance privacy rights with freedom of information concerns, the court killed it.\n\nLesson #2: Global Injunctions Are Not Inherently Problematic\n\nWhile the court said that EU law does not give France express authority to compel Google to remove listings worldwide, \u201cit also does not prohibit such a practice.\u201d The Court of Justice suggested that, even absent any new statutory authority from the EU, regulators\u2014though it is unclear which ones\u2014might nonetheless have good reason to order a global injunction, as long as they balance privacy with freedom of information:\n\nAccordingly, a supervisory or judicial authority of a Member State remains competent to weigh up, in the light of national standards of protection of fundamental rights \u2026 a data subject\u2019s right to privacy and the protection of personal data concerning him or her, on the one hand, and the right to freedom of information, on the other, and, after weighing those rights against each other, to order, where appropriate, the operator of that search engine to carry out a de-referencing concerning all versions of that search engine.\n\nThis means that even before EU legislators grant express statutory authorization for global injunctions, a data regulator\u2014such as the CNIL\u2014should be able to demonstrate that it has weighed privacy against freedom of information and then, \u201cwhere appropriate\u201d\u2014a caveat that will surely be the subject of future litigation\u2014issue a global delisting demand.\n\nNot only did the court find nothing wrong about global injunctions, per se, but it also suggested that they are perhaps especially useful as remedies to internet harms, which are often far reaching. The court noted:\n\nIn a globalised world, internet users\u2019 access \u2014 including those outside the Union \u2014 to the referencing of a link referring to information regarding a person whose centre of interests is situated in the Union is thus likely to have immediate and substantial effects on that person within the Union itself. Such considerations are such as to justify the existence of a competence on the part of the EU legislature to lay down the obligation, for a search engine operator, to carry out, when granting a request for de-referencing made by such a person, a de-referencing on all the versions of its search engine. [Emphasis added.]\n\nThis is consistent with the thinking by the Canadian Supreme Court, which upheld a global injunction in 2017 in Google v Equustek. While Google argued that the internet\u2019s global nature made global injunctions offensive, the court found that the argument ran the other way: \u201cThe problem in this case is occurring online and globally. The Internet has no borders \u2014 its natural habitat is global. The only way to ensure that the interlocutory injunction attained its objective was to have it apply where Google operates \u2014 globally.\u201d [Emphasis added.]\n\nThere was much ado about the Equustek decision\u2014mostly commentators complaining that this was an improper exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction, with the suggestion that extraterritoriality is at odds with international comity. As I explain in \u201cLitigating Data Sovereignty,\u201d 128 Yale L.J. 128, 328 (2018), this is wrong. Foreign affairs scholars, principally Bill Dodge, have shown convincingly that comity doctrines are just as much about recognition and accommodation as they are about restraint. The history of extraterritorial, even global, orders is long. The internet will not stop these orders; to the contrary, it might call for more of them.\n\nLesson #3: The Case Mirrors Two Big Debates in the U.S.: Universal Injunctions and Content Moderation\n\nReading the EU decisions, I was struck by just how much they echo key law-and-policy debates in the U.S. The same day that the Right to be Forgotten decisions came out, I read Mila Sohoni\u2019s fantastic new article, \u201cThe Lost History of the \u2018Universal\u2019 Injunction,\u201d forthcoming in the Harvard Law Review. Before the travel ban cases, but especially after them, federal courts scholars have been focused on\u2014consumed by?\u2014the scope of federal injunctions. The federal courts debate is different in key respects from the debate over global internet injunctions\u2014principally because the former is about who may be enjoined, not just where. But the debates overlap to a significant degree, interrogating both the proper role of courts in a democratic society and, just as importantly, the appropriate scope of equitable remedies. It would be interesting to know if one\u2019s views about \u201cuniversal injunctions\u201d in the federal courts debate are predictive of one\u2019s views on \u201cglobal injunctions\u201d in the internet context (and vice versa). I suspect they are not.\n\nI was also struck by just how familiar the European Court of Justice\u2019s statements about regulating online speech felt. The court blustered about the need for strong speech regulations, on the one hand, but then acknowledged how, in practice, it is nearly impossible to get right on a massive platform. The court, in its sensitive data ruling, noted that, while Google must get consent before processing sensitive classes of data, it did not expect Google to solve this problem without some help from users about what was in fact sensitive and non-consensual data sharing. The court noted that \u201c[i]n practice, it is scarcely conceivable\u201d (emphasis added) that Google will actually be able to get consent for everything a user posts online. Users must tell Google what content is sensitive and non-consensual, so that Google knows what to take down. This is notice and takedown, a regime we know well in the U.S.\n\nHere in the states, we regularly demand new or better content moderation rules only to later punt because it turns out it\u2019s just really hard to do. Facebook is practically begging not to make the rules anymore\u2014or at least not to do so alone\u2014and yet regulators have been reluctant to help out the firm with clear rules. Then there is the practical problem of moderating huge volumes of content in real time. When Mark Zuckerberg testified about the difficulty of cracking down on Russian influence campaigns using social media platforms, he suggested repeatedly that artificial intelligence (AI) would fix the content moderation problem, but when pressed about the likelihood of that happening or the timeline, he balked. AI is just not up to the task of perfect real-time moderation on massive platforms. That\u2019s why Facebook has so many thousands of folks working on content moderation (as, by the way, does the Chinese government). Content moderation is hard, especially in real time, and the European Court of Justice appears to agree.", "description": "The two rulings issued this week by Europe\u2019s highest court reveal how Google is faring in its war against global injunctions.
