Male-led companies are penalized more for competence failures in industries regarded as more stereotypically \u201cmale,\u201d like automobiles.\n\nWhat drives these disparities?\n\nPeople tend to associate women with \u201ccommunal\u201d traits like likability, warmth and relatability, lead study author Nicole Votolato Montgomery, an associate professor of commerce at the University of Virginia, told MarketWatch.\n\nIn other words, a woman\u2019s leadership of an organization makes consumers expect that the company will be more ethical, she said. It also gives them lower expectations of the company\u2019s competence.\n\n\u201cI believe that you\u2019re going to be a moral company because you have a female CEO,\u201d Montgomery explained this thinking. \u201dBut you know what? You may not be as competent.\u201d\n\nFemale chief executives aren\u2019t the only powerful women who appear to face harsher scrutiny for ethical issues. Montgomery and her co-author, UVA associate commerce professor Amanda Cowen, cite in their study an example from the 2016 presidential election: Despite documentation that then-candidate Donald Trump had made more false statements than rival Hillary Clinton, some polls showed that voters perceived him to be more trustworthy.\n\nWomen lead just 33 companies (6.6%) in the Fortune 500, and even that share is a record high. A related phenomenon known as the \u201cglass cliff\u201d \u2014 in which women are tapped to lead flailing companies back on course \u2014 has also been well documented, with the tenures of former Yahoo! CEOs Carol Bartz and Marissa Mayer frequently used as case studies.\n\nFemale CEOs can manage perceptions of themselves by cultivating what researchers called \u201cagentic\u201d male personality stereotypes, Montgomery said \u2014 presenting themselves as more ambitious, independent, skilled and adept at working under pressure. If women portray themselves as such, \u201cthe penalties are actually more in line with how male-led organizations are penalized,\u201d she said.\n\nFormer PepsiCo PEP, -0.05% CEO Indra Nooyi, who stepped down from her post in 2018, provided a lesson in this strategy, Montgomery said. \u201cIndra Nooyi is a great example of somebody who has had success positioning herself as more agentic, and was able to manage activist campaigns against Pepsi and some other sorts of things that rose during her tenure there,\u201d she said.\n\nThe ways in which the popular press and organizations themselves write and communicate about CEOs can also impact perceptions during a company failure, Montgomery suggested.\n\n\u201cWomen who are written about as more independent [and] more skilled, as opposed to using more communal traits, like \u2018She\u2019s likable\u2019 \u2014 that has implications for how consumers perceive these crises, and then their interaction with the companies,\u201d Montgomery said.", "description": "Consumers are less likely to buy products from female-led organizations than they are from male-led organizations following an ethical failure, a new study...", "authors": ["Meera Jagannathan"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU051_ceo_ZG_20191025154454.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
