The cheeseboard includes brie, roquefort, banon and reblochon among others.\n\nTo offset the riches of such fine living, take an on-board bike for rides along the towpath while enjoying the incredible views, then soothe your muscles in the on-deck hot tub with a perfect vista off the prow; a heady glass of champagne in hand \u2013 it\u2019s all about the bubbles.", "description": "Sara Macefield discovers that there's a real sparkle that comes from sailing through France's Champagne region - and it doesn't just revolve around its most celebrated drink.", "authors": ["Sara Macefield For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/20/09/18347686-0-image-a-14_1568969345161.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
