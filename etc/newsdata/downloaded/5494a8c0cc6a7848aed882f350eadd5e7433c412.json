The court filing says the security company wasn\u2019t able to break WhatsApp\u2019s end-to-end encryption, so it used malicious code to snoop on chat messages.\n\nIn May, the chat app patched a vulnerability that allowed hackers to install malware through an audio call even if you don\u2019t answer it. At the time, sources told the Financial Times that NSO Group was responsible for this exploit.\n\nIn a column posted in Washington Post after the lawsuit, the company head Will Cathcart said NSO Group targeted \u201cat least 100 human-rights defenders, journalists and other members of civil society across the world.\u201d\n\nThe Israel-based security group has been notoriously accused of supplying snooping tools to governments. WhatsApp\u2019s court filing alleges the security company says its Pegasus software \u201ccould remotely and covertly extract valuable information from virtually any mobile device.\u201d\n\nNSO Group has been involved in human rights issues as well. Last year, Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist, was tortured and murdered by Saudi Arabia inside the country\u2019s consulate in Istanbul. Gizmodo notes the company\u2019s spyware was found on one of the Khashoggi\u2019s contact\u2019s phone.\n\nAccording to a report by Motherboard, the group has been trying to clean up its image with select interviews and Google ads.\n\nHowever, in a statement to TechCrunch, the firm said it disputes WhatsApp\u2019s allegations strongly:\n\nIn the strongest possible terms, we dispute today\u2019s allegations and will vigorously fight them.\n\nAlmost every communications software company like WhatsApp is facing pressure from governments across the world to install a backdoor to let them trace messages for security purposes. However, if there\u2019s a backdoor in services with end-to-end encryption, there\u2019s a strong possibility of it being exploited by governments for snooping and censorship and by bad actors to steal information.\n\nAuthorities across the globe must understand this threat, and stop encouraging tools that can be used for mass surveillance.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ivan Mehta"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F07%2FWhatsApp-police-hed.jpg&signature=e4b7c34c732ccc5d3b7d9727e6e91907", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
