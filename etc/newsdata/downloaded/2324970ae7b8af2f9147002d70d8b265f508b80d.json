The second was \u201cnever going to happen,\u201d he added, but on the third he said that \u201call the polls suggest that is what the British people actually want but their political system isn\u2019t able to give that to them that choice.\u201d\n\nVaradkar said that Johnson\u2019s insistence on Thursday morning that customs checks would require no new physical infrastructure anywhere on the island was \u201cin contradiction to the papers presented by the U.K. government yesterday\u201d and that any consent mechanism for Belfast should not give \u201cany one party, of any denomination, a veto.\u201d\n\nThe governing institutions in Belfast have not been in place since power-sharing between the Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn F\u00e9in collapsed in January 2017. The U.K. government has not been clear how consent could be granted in their absence.\n\nThe DUP back Johnson\u2019s proposals but Sinn Fein does not.\n\nVaradkar indicated that Ireland may prefer a no-deal Brexit to signing up to an agreement that would permanently enshrine the need for checks on north-south trade on the island.\n\n\u201cIt may be the case that we have to live no deal for a period of time,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIreland will do what is necessary to protect the single market, to ensure our place in the single market is protected,\u201d he added, although he said that plans for dealing with trade crossing the land border with the U.K. had not yet been agreed with the European Commission.\n\nAny such arrangement may require Ireland to impose single market checks at the frontier.\n\nBut Varadkar said that living with no-deal \u201cfor a period of time while we negotiate a deal, or while we pursue other solutions, is very different to an Irish government actually signing up in an international treaty to putting in place checks between north and south. That\u2019s something we can\u2019t countenance.\u201d", "description": "Irish prime minister said his country would sooner see a no-deal Brexit than sign up to permanent checks on trade across Irish border.", "authors": ["Charlie Cooper", "James Randerson"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-1146732822-1200x628.jpg"}
