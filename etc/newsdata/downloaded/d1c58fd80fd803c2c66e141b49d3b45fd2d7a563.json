It is not the role of the NBA to adjudicate those differences,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, the NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cValues of equality, respect and freedom of expression have long defined the NBA \u2014 and will continue to do so,\u201d he added. \u201cAs an American-based basketball league operating globally, among our greatest contributions are these values of the game.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nChinese state media didn\u2019t buy it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve noticed NBA Commissioner Adam Silver\u2019s response to the inappropriate remarks by Houston Rockets GM Morey. We are strongly unsatisfied and opposed to Adam Silver\u2019s claim of supporting Morey\u2019s rights of having freedom of speech,\u201d sports channel CCTV5 said Tuesday on its social media page. \u201cWe think any remarks that challenge national sovereignty and social stability are outside the category of freedom of speech.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCCTV5 added that it would \u201cimmediately investigate all cooperation and exchanges with the NBA,\u201d hinting at a potentially deeper rupture with the league, which has a three-decade-long history with CCTV and, as of this summer, a $1.5 billion streaming deal with Internet portal Tencent.\n\nAD\n\nCCTV5\u2019s announcement will affect at least two preseason games scheduled this week between the Brooklyn Nets and Los Angeles Lakers \u2014 games meant to showcase stars such as LeBron James for Chinese fans. The Nets and Lakers are scheduled to play Thursday and Saturday in Shanghai and Shenzhen.\n\nAfter the controversy erupted over the weekend, several Chinese celebrities who had signed on to perform at the Shanghai event swiftly backed out, and practically all e-commerce platforms took down Rockets merchandise. By Tuesday evening, several brands, including smartphone maker Vivo and the Luckin Coffee chain, also cut their sponsorship deals with the NBA.\n\nAD\n\nThe NBA China spokesman\u2019s phone was turned off on Tuesday.\n\nAD\n\n\u2018We too love money more than freedom\u2019: South Park creators issue mock apology over reported Chinese censorship\n\nFor many Americans, including lawmakers in Washington, the rapidly spiraling episode seemed to demonstrate how China, flush with nationalist sentiment and raw consumer power, can bend a major American sports league to its will.\n\nMany Chinese, steered by a steady stream of state media propaganda, believe Hong Kong\u2019s protesters are violent rioters manipulated by U.S. intelligence agencies to challenge Chinese national sovereignty.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Tuesday that the decision by state media to cancel coverage of the preseason exhibitions this week reflected the popular will of Chinese people.\n\n\u201cI suggest that you pay attention to the reaction of ordinary Chinese people on this matter and their attitudes,\u201d Geng said. \u201cIt is not feasible to conduct exchanges and cooperation with the Chinese yet not understand Chinese public opinion.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBy Tuesday, the fast-moving story seemed to become a proxy tussle over U.S.-China relations. After lawmakers in Washington criticized the NBA for rebuking Morey and sacrificing American civil liberties to appease an authoritarian regime in China, Hu Xijin, the outspoken editor of the nationalist Global Times newspaper, said the saga showed that China and the United States were clashing at a deep cultural level.\n\n\u201cThings are evolving into serious conflicts between the two kinds of political correctness of the American and Chinese societies, and there is little room for mediation in the middle,\u201d he wrote in a lengthy essay on Weibo. \u201cThe more rabidly the U.S. demonstrates its political correctness, the more radical a backlash it will get from the Chinese Internet. The absurd U.S. arrogance will kill the NBA\u2019s market in China.\u201d\n\nNBA under fire from all directions after response to Rockets-China incident\n\nThe NBA just capitulated to China. It\u2019s shocking, but not a surprise.\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news\n\nAD", "description": "\u201cAny remarks that challenge national sovereignty and social stability are outside the category of freedom of speech,\u201d state television said.", "authors": ["Gerry Shih", "China Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/BMQOFz1fhy8trgLYu_HYXPICc2A=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UYGDCUXJXUI6TEYGI7FQGJH5IQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
