Kamala D. Harris of California, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island requested the documents through the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nThe three senators, who are all members of the Judiciary Committee, said the public records request was necessary because the administration has stonewalled previous demands for documents.\n\n\u201cCongress shouldn\u2019t have to submit open records requests to conduct oversight, but that\u2019s the kind of obstruction we\u2019ve come to expect from this administration,\u201d Mr. Whitehouse said in a statement.\n\nThe senators are seeking communications from Attorney General William P. Barr and other Justice Department officials that include roughly 75 words and phrases.\n\nAmong those phrases are \u201cGiuliani,\u201d the last name of the president\u2019s personal attorney Rudolph W. Guiliani; \u201cBill Taylor,\u201d the former acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine; and \u201cFraud Guarantee,\u201d the name of a company owned by associates of Mr. Giuliani who have been arrested on campaign violations.\n\nThe senators are also seeking documents between Mr. Barr and others in the Justice Department regarding China, Ukraine and any request to investigate political rivals or companies associated with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden\u2019s son Hunter.\n\n\u201cAttorney General Barr acts more like Donald Trump\u2019s personal political fixer than the independent head of federal law enforcement,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal said in a statement. \u201cNow Barr has been directly named as a possible accomplice in President Trump\u2019s attempts to seek corrupt assistance from a foreign leader for personal political gain.\u201d\n\nFreedom of Information Act requests can take months or even years to complete, raising the question of when the senators could receive their documents, if at all.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
