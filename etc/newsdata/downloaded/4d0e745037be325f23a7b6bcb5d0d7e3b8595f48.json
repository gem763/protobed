REUTERS/Gene Blevins/File Photo\n\nThe company, a unit of Allen\u2019s privately-held investment vehicle Vulcan Inc, had been developing a fleet of launch vehicles, including the world\u2019s largest airplane by wingspan, to send satellites and eventually humans into space.\n\nAllen, who founded Seattle-based Stratolaunch in 2011, died at age 65 in October.\n\nReuters reported in May that the company was exploring the sale of its assets and intellectual property while in the process of closing operations. It had slashed headcount.\n\n\u201cStratolaunch LLC has transitioned ownership and is continuing regular operations,\u201d a spokeswoman said by e-mail.\n\nIt declined to provide details beyond the short announcement, which also said its \u201cnear-term launch vehicle development strategy\u201d focuses on testing reusable rocket-powered vehicles and associated flight services.\n\nIt said the company would continue operations under the new owner with a mission that \u201cwill bring the carrier aircraft test and operations program fully in-house.\u201d\n\nAllen\u2019s Stratolaunch had been compared to other space ventures backed by billionaires, including Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Orbit, which is developing a similar but smaller high-altitude launch system to cash in on growing demand for ferrying small satellites into orbit.\n\nWhile Virgin Orbit Chief Executive Dan Hart told Reuters in July his company had discussions in the past with Stratolaunch about their desire to sell, Virgin Orbit was not the buyer, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said.\n\nThe centerpiece of Stratolaunch\u2019s strategy was its carbon-composite carrier plane, with a 117-meter (384-foot) wingspan and powered by six engines. The plane flew for the first time in April.\n\nThe decision to set an exit strategy was made late last year by Allen\u2019s sister, Jody Allen, chair of Vulcan Inc and trustee of the Paul G. Allen Trust, industry sources told Reuters.\n\nJody Allen decided to let the carrier aircraft fly to honor her brother\u2019s wishes and also to prove the vehicle and concept worked, the sources said.", "description": "Stratolaunch Systems Corp, the space company founded by late billionaire and Microsoft Corp co-founder Paul Allen, said on Friday it was continuing operations after transitioning ownership, but did not name the new owner.", "authors": ["Eric M.
