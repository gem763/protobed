Burn them. We have to make an example of them.\u201d\n\nVice President Dick Cheney issued that edict after whistleblower Thomas Drake, a former senior executive at the NSA, revealed the unconstitutional mass surveillance regime that had been instituted after 9/11, Drake himself said in a recent interview with The American Conservative.\n\nThe constant drumbeat of demands to reveal the names of whistleblowers who filed a complaint against President Trump gives Drake horrible \u201cflashbacks,\u201d he says. And while Republicans endlessly repeat that the American people have a \u201cright to know\u201d their identities, Drake doesn\u2019t agree.\n\n\u201cThe identity of the whistleblower is irrelevant,\u201d he says. \u201cThe focus should be on the message, not the messenger. The information that was provided doesn\u2019t require the whistleblower to come before Congress.\u201d (Congress has been issuing subpoenas to first-hand witnesses to substantiate the complaint.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI have major concerns for the safety of the whistleblower,\u201d Drake continues. \u201cThe president of the United States hasn\u2019t minced words in terms of his perspective. If you call out the behavior of a president\u2026they\u2019re going to counterattack. Mine happened behind closed doors. The counterattack on the Ukraine whistleblower is occurring in full view of the public.\u201d\n\nDrake says safety concerns are all the more salient because \u201cthe president is fully exposed here. He has enormous power.\u201d\n\nDrake recalls how in his case he was warned by senior leadership at the NSA: \u201cThey were looking for leakers to Congress. The warning was crystal clear: you cooperate with them at your peril.\u201d\n\nThe way the Trump administration is responding tells you that the whistleblower\u2019s disclosures hit \u201cclose to home\u2026just like mine did,\u201d Drake says. The \u201cdegree to which the government responds to a whistleblower complaint is the degree to which the whistleblower\u2019s disclosures are accurate.\u201d\n\nDrake knows what it\u2019s like to become a target of the state. He earned Cheney\u2019s wrath when he was working as a senior level official at the National Security Agency (NSA) after September 11, 2001. Alarmed by the NSA\u2019s warrantless surveillance of Americans, Drake reported it to the Inspectors General and to congressional committees. In 2007, after a reporter for the Baltimore Sun published articles on the waste, fraud, and abuse at the NSA, FBI agents, guns blazing, raided the homes of the people who had worked on the Inspector General report and took their computers, books, and papers. In 2010, Barack Obama\u2019s administration indicted Drake under the Espionage Act. Members of Congress, he says, were calling him a \u201ctraitor.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey wanted me to be sent to prison in an orange jumpsuit. I was facing 35 years. The prosecutors were saying that I was worse than a spy,\u201d he says, pointing out how Trump has used the similar language to describe the Ukraine whistleblower.\n\nAfter the leak, Drake was unable to find work in the intelligence community. To support his family, he worked at an Apple store. Eventually all 10 felony charges against him were dropped and a plea deal struck on the eve of the trial. Drake was sentenced to community service and probation. U.S. District Judge Richard D. Bennett refused to impose a fine, calling the government\u2019s decision to drag Drake and his family through \u201cfour years of hell\u201d only to drop all felony charges at the last minute \u201cunconscionable.\u201d\n\nBecause he experienced the heavy personal toll of living as a whistleblower, Drake says he has \u201cconcern for the blowback\u201d today\u2019s whistleblowers will face.\n\n\u201cYour entire life gets blown up\u201d and there\u2019s no going back to the way it was before, he says. \u201cIf there\u2019s an actual vote for impeachment, then the whistleblower\u2019s life will never be the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cHistorically, whistleblowers have a love/hate relationship particularly with those in power,\u201d says Drake. \u201cIf you\u2019re in power you don\u2019t like them at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cWeird things happen when you become president,\u201d Drake says. \u201cI saw what happens to people when they have power: it does affect you, believing you affect the lives of others. It\u2019s incredibly tempting to abuse power; it\u2019s seductiveness is overwhelming.\u201d\n\nDrake sounds like an idealist when he talks about the president\u2019s duties under the Constitution, though it\u2019s striking the amount of personal courage it takes to report government wrongdoing. He lost his job; he almost lost his freedom.\n\nThe media took a long time to cover Drake\u2019s case favorably. At first they accepted the Obama administration\u2019s narrative that Drake was \u201ca spy who must have done something awful,\u201d he says. But thanks in part to Jane Mayer\u2019s reporting at the New Yorker, journalists slowly began to question whether he was really an \u201cenemy of the state.\u201d Drake went on to win the Ridenhour Truth Telling Prize while still facing felony charges.\n\nThe whistleblowers on Ukraine haven\u2019t been subjected to the hell Drake endured because their complaint is public and \u201chighly politicized,\u201d says Drake. \u201cTrump\u2019s such a lightning rod.\u201d\n\nStill, he says, it\u2019s \u201cappalling\u201d that some reports wax poetic and yearn for the presidencies of George W. Bush and Barack Obama.\n\nJust like his predecessors, Drake charges, Trump \u201chas been utterly unfaithful to the constitution.\u201d\n\nBarbara Boland is The American Conservative\u2019s foreign policy and national security reporter.
