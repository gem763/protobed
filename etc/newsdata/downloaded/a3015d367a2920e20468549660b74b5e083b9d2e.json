He is a staunch opponent of Donald Trump. He is willing to spend years on conspiracies (Russian collusion, Ukraine phone call). He also selectively leaks items to the press to help his own narrative.\n\nNow consider this bit of hilarity about the House member.\n\nIt was just reported on @MSNBC that House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff received no notification or briefing on the Baghdadi operation. \u2014 Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) October 27, 2019\n\nConsidering all of these realities it would only make sense that a secret military mission instituted by the White House would take place without input from the Leaker-In-Chief.\n\nHis TS SCI is in jeopardy! Why share this with anyone! His Leaks would have killed US Troops and then he and the liberal media would have blamed Trump! \u2014 CYCLONE93 (@marcus_smoot) October 27, 2019\n\nExcellent call on the part of @realDonaldTrump. \u201cFool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice.. \u201c \u2026never in the case of our @POTUS \u2014 Sherry Kerdman (@sherry_kerdman) October 27, 2019\n\nThank goodness; he would\u2019ve leaked it to warn the #religiousscholar that we were on the way to blow him up. #ISIS \u2014 Jim Regan\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb#\ufe0f\u20e38/8 (@Jbones72) October 27, 2019\n\nAnd thus, the mission was a success & nothing was leaked. I fail to see the problem here. \u2014 PMSnetwork (@pmsnetwork) October 27, 2019\n\nHe\u2019s got security clearance. He can read about it. pic.twitter.com/adYKai9iZV \u2014 IntegrityCounts (@3mdive) October 27, 2019\n\nOf course the man who has proven himself unworthy to be trusted with classified intel is surprised to be out of the loop on a classified mission.\n\nAnd nobody died. Crazy how that works \u2014 HeisenZerp (@HeisenZerp) October 27, 2019\n\nHe can read the transcripts \u2014 John Collins (@VStrom_John) October 27, 2019\n\nIt was a closed door meeting, Kyle. \u2014 The Panic (@Gunntwitt) October 27, 2019\n\nWe don\u2019t care who you are, that\u2019s just funny right there!\n\nThen there is something that MSNBC and the democrats do not normally traffick in \u2014 reality.\n\nBlack ops missions are on a need to know bases the house intel committee isn\u2019t on the list of need to know on these operations they never have been \u2014 Troypollock (@troypollock73) October 27, 2019\n\nThis is SOP. Only SOCOM commander and potus would be in the know on this. Same happened with bin laden capture between Obama and McRaven \u2014 Paige-o-ween \ud83c\udf83 (@PaigeSully88) October 27, 2019\n\nOPSEC / COMSEC Prohibits the dissemination of sensitive information to foreign agents. If schiff or omar had been notified they would have immediately sent texts to their jihadi masters and American lives would have been immediately compromised. \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 #MAGA #KAG \u2014 Sgt Daniel L McCaughan (@DanMcCaughan) October 27, 2019\n\nConsidering the mission was a consummate success with no loss of American lives there is little to complain about. It also justifies that not telling Schiff was the proper move.", "description": "After proving himself a partisan liar and willing to release classified intel MSNBC is surprised Adam Schiff was locked out of a military mission.", "authors": ["Brad S.", "Posted At Pm On October"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/adamschiff1_AP.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
