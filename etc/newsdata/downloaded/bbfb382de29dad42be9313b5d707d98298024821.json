Al-Mansoori\u2019s team wrapped the smiling astronaut in his country\u2019s flag before taking him away for more health checks.\n\nThe former military pilot, the first Arab to have traveled to the International Space Station, will return home to a hero\u2019s welcome as his flight last month was widely celebrated across the country, and Dubai\u2019s tallest skyscraper was lit up to mark the launch.\n\nThe UAE has a fledgling space program with big ambitions. It launched its first locally made satellite, KhalifaSat, in October from Japan, and it also wants to launch a probe to Mars in 2020.\n\nThree NASA astronauts, a European Space Agency crewmember and two Russians remain aboard the orbiting lab to continue their work on hundreds of scientific experiments.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
