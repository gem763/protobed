That all changes with this recipe for cured beef sirloin from Holly Davis\u2019 Ferment. In just a few steps, Davis demystifies this seemingly-intimidating process, leaving us with an easy, homemade addition to elevate any charcuterie board. And if raw just isn\u2019t your thing? These cuts of marinated meat will taste equally great seared and served as steaks.\n\nMaple, Fennel, and Peppercorn Sirloin\n\nBy Holly Davis\n\nHere, the seasoned salt and sugar mixture prevents the meat from oxidizing, while drawing out some moisture and adding flavor. The result is intensely delicious, semi-dried tender beef. The longer the beef is left to cure, the stronger the flavor and drier the texture. It is important to use the best quality of grass-fed sirloin beef you can find for this recipe.\n\nYou might slice this thinly to serve raw or thicky to sear and serve as steaks. If serving raw, drizzle with good extra virgin olive oil and serve with a green salad, brined beets with orange and juniper, or finely sliced kumquat, cassia and bay.\n\nIngredients\n\n2 lb 4 oz (1 kg) pasture-raised organic beef sirloin\n\nFor the cure:\n\n1 \u00bd tbsp mixed peppercorns, lightly crushed\n\n8 \u00bd oz (240 g) coarse sea salt\n\n4 \u00bc oz (120 g) maple sugar or light brown muscovado sugar\n\n1 \u00bd tbsp fennel seeds\n\n2 chilies, to taste (optional)\n\nPreparation\n\nTake a very clean nonreactive container in which to cure the meat \u2013 a small enamel baking tray works nicely.\n\nTrim the meat of any obvious sinew and most, but not all, of the fat capping. Leave the cap on if you will be searing and serving as steaks.\n\nCombine all the cure ingredients in a bowl.\n\nCURE: Sprinkle half of the cure mixture in an even layer over the base of the container or tray and lay the beef on top, then cover with the remaining mixture and rub the cure into the beef, making sure to get it into all the crevices.\n\nCover the beef with a sheet of parchment paper and weight down using a small plate with additional weight on top, such as a sealed jar filled with water. Place the weighted container in the fridge for 24\u201372 hours, turning the beef every 6 hours or so. The beef will firm up as it cures and releases liquid.\n\nRemove the beef from the cure, and brush off and discard as much of the cure as possible.\n\nSlice into wafer-thin pieces and eat as is or cut into thick slices ready to sear in a hot frying pan.\n\nBe sure to sear the fat cap well too, and don\u2019t overcook the steaks.\n\nYield: Serves 8-12 sliced thinly, or 6 as steaks\n\nExcerpted from Ferment: A Guide to the Ancient Art of Culturing Foods from Kombucha to Sourdough by Holly Davis.
