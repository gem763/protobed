Not when the rich and the powerful, the amoral and the sleazy \u2014 liars, cheats and unspeakably entitled thieves of anything and everything they can snatch with their paws from honorable folk \u2014 get away with it, time and again.\n\nOn Friday, actress Felicity Huffman whined, mewled and ugly-cried. She shamelessly begged a federal judge in Boston to spare her from even a day in the slammer for attempting to rig the system in favor of her daughter, paying a man $15,000 to go into the teen\u2019s completed SAT test and change wrong answers into right ones.\n\nAnd when the dust settled, and she straightened her face, the judge sentenced desperate Huffman to a mere 14 days in stir \u2014 or less than a day for each one-thousand dollars she spent to steal her kid\u2019s seat from a poorer and more deserving scholar who couldn\u2019t afford to scam his or her way into an institution of higher education.\n\nI am tired. I\u2019m tired of explaining how this is not a victimless crime, and Huffman not only helped to damage the integrity of higher learning, rendering diplomas worthless, but she attempted to swipe opportunity from another kid.\n\nTwo weeks (probably reduced in the long run), plus a fine of $30,000, 250 hours of community service and a year of supervised release, may sound like a big deal you and me. To Huffman, it\u2019s less than an hour\u2019s work, plus barely enough time to have her hair and makeup touched up.\n\nMaybe she\u2019ll get a memoir or TV movie out of it.\n\nIn the days leading up to her sentencing, Huffman infuriatingly made herself out to be a victim in a letter to the judge.\n\nsee also Don\u2019t buy Felicity Huffman\u2019s pathetic excuses Oh, boo-hoo! Desperate actress Felicity Huffman is to face the...\n\nShe painted herself as an insecure, anxious mother (as if there\u2019s another kind) being punished by a sexist system, and complained that she just wanted the best for her daughter. She got some celebrated pals and her famous actor husband William H. Macy, to vouch for her good character. It was a circus.\n\nIt will only get worse.\n\nBy the time she\u2019s released from prison, if she ends up actually going to prison at all, she\u2019ll be transformed into something I detest: A martyr.\n\nShe should have taken her punishment like an adult, and spent the rest of her life atoning for her sins by making sure poor kids receive the education they deserve.\n\nInstead, as she cries into the sunset, we are faced with dozens more college scammers who, when it\u2019s their turn to face judges, if they ever face judges, can point to Felicity Huffman and say \u2014 \u201cShe got away with it, can I?\u2019\u2019", "description": "There is no justice.
