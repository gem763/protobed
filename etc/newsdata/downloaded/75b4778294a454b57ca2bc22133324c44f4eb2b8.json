I don't understand what the purpose of this was.\"\n\n\"I came here because I was invited, and I talked about white privilege because it's a real thing that you are actually benefiting from right now in even asking this question,\" Crucet responded, per the paper.\n\nHere\u2019s my official statement about what happened at the @GeorgiaSouthern event \u2014 and please direct all questions or media requests to James (dot) Meader (at) picadorusa (dot) com.\n\n\n\nMuch love and gratitude to all those who\u2019ve shown support here and elsewhere. Abrazos to you all. pic.twitter.com/9uEuALUlvs \u2014 Jennine Cap\u00f3 Crucet (@crucet) October 11, 2019\n\nIn her Friday statement, Crucet said the student had a \"hostile reaction\" that \"closely mirrored the exchange that I recount in the essay itself. it was very surreal and strange.\" She continued that \"after students began shouting back and forth at each other,\" she asked faculty to find the student who asked the question \"and other students who were similarly upset, and follow up with them because a compassionate and continuing conversation needed to occur.\"\n\nCrucet added that \"the event continued as planned, with other students apologizing for the strangeness and rudeness they felt their peer had shown in the way the question was delivered.\"\n\nAlso want to say: I met some very amazing, brilliant students at @GeorgiaSouthern tonight. Many of them were the ones disrupting the aggressive & ignorant comments during the Q&A. At the signing, we hugged & cried. I\u2018m happy to know them and also legit worried for their safety. \u2014 Jennine Cap\u00f3 Crucet (@crucet) October 10, 2019\n\nLater Wednesday evening after the event, a video was posted on Twitter that showed a group of students allegedly burning her book.\n\nso after our FYE book's author came to my school to talk about it... these people decide to burn her book because \"it's bad and that race is bad to talk about\". white people need to realize that they are the problem and that their privilege is toxic. author is a woman of color. pic.twitter.com/HiX4lGT7Ci \u2014 elaina\u2b50\ufe0f (@elainaaan) October 10, 2019\n\n\"While it's within the students' First Amendment rights, book burning does not align with Georgia Southern's values nor does it encourage the civil discourse and debate of ideas,\" John Lester, vice president for strategic communications and marketing said in a statement to The George-Anne.\n\nStudents at Georgia Southern University burned a book at Eagle Village, written by @crucet, after a Q&A session at her lecture Wednesday became heated.\n\n\n\nRead more here: https://t.co/Re8VWOMkHV\n\nArticle by @sarahbsmithh and @McclainBaxley pic.twitter.com/OkDifF8Zbu \u2014 The George-Anne (@TheGeorgeAnne) October 10, 2019\n\nCrucet said that during the event \"many students remarked on how much the story of the novel's protagonist mirrored their own, and expressed gratitude for the book.\"\n\n\"To think of those students watching as a group of their peers burned that story -- effectively erasing them on the campus they are expected to think of as a safe space -- feels devastating,\" she said.\n\nCrucet has a second book, \"My Time Among the Whites: Notes from an Unfinished Education,\" that includes a collection of essays on \"feeling like an 'accidental' American and the tectonic edges of identity in a society centered on whiteness,\" according to her website.\n\nABC News' Alexandra Svokos contributed to this report.", "description": "Jennine Cap\u00f3 Crucet spoke about her book and white privilege at Georgia Southern University followed by a discussion with students and later saw some burned her book.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/jennine-capo-crucet-file-gty-jef-191011_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
