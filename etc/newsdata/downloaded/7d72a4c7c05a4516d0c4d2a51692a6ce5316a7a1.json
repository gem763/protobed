Finding this nest site and these small eastern screech owls is very difficult but when you do it really pays off.\n\n'This is why I photograph these special situations, so I can share them with other people who love nature.'\n\nHe said the owl had been sitting on her eggs all day and will 'come out and stretch' before sitting low as she nurtures her babies.\n\nThe owl camouflaged itself while resting nestled inside a tree in Colorado when Blake stumbled across it, earlier this year\n\nBlake watched the same pair for years and observed their behaviour while learning how they 'survive in the world today'.\n\nHe was thrilled to capture the peacefully resting animal, earlier this year.\n\nEastern Screech owls are short and stocky birds with distinct pointed ear tuffs. Their mostly grey or reddish tone of fur with bands of pattern make them perfectly camouflage against tree bark.\n\nAlongside owls ability to hide in plain sight, they can hear up to 10 times better than humans and two types of feathers which help them fly and snare their prey.\n\nTheir eggs are laid individually every one to two days but this becomes more erratic after the first few are hatched. They are born blind and only have a thin coat of natal down so their mother's can be extremely protective.\n\nBlake returned to same nesting spot where he managed to capture the Eastern Screech owls. The species is distinct with pointed ear tufts which are often raised\n\nThe speckled and complex bands and patterns make the Eastern Screech amazing camouflage against tree bark", "description": "An Eastern Screech Owl was almost invisible in plain sight after being captured camouflaged in a tree by Blake Hess, in Colorado, US, earlier this year.
