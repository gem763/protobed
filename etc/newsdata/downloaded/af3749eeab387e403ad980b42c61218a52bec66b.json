A poll conducted for The New York Times by the internet research firm SurveyMonkey this summer found that two-thirds of Americans, including a majority of Republicans, supported a 2 percent tax on households worth over $50 million, which is the heart of Ms. Warren\u2019s plan.\n\nThe proposals for a wealth tax are among a variety of ideas for collecting more tax revenue that Democratic presidential candidates have put forward. On Monday, Mr. Sanders proposed a new tax on corporations that have a huge gap between what they pay their chief executive and their median worker. Jared Bernstein, who was chief economist for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. from 2009 to 2011, said he has discussed with the Biden campaign a proposal to tax financial transactions.\n\n[The latest data and analysis to keep track of who\u2019s leading the race to be the Democratic nominee.]\n\nOn the campaign trail, Ms. Warren explains the concept of a wealth tax by putting it in familiar terms, likening it to the property taxes that many Americans pay on their homes. For the super rich, she said in South Carolina on Saturday, \u201chow about we include in yours not only your real estate, but also your stock portfolio, the diamonds, the Rembrandt and the yacht?\u201d\n\nMr. Sanders is blunt about his desire to reduce the size of America\u2019s biggest fortunes, even highlighting how much individual billionaires would have to pay in taxes under his proposal. He said last week that he did not believe billionaires should exist in the United States.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question to my mind that the United States is moving toward an oligarchy,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cThis is an issue that has to be addressed, and this wealth tax begins to do that.\u201d\n\nThe United States largely taxes individuals based on the income they earn through their jobs and investments. Wealth taxes impose annual levies on an individual\u2019s accumulated assets, everything from vacation homes and art collections to stakes in companies and family heirlooms.", "description": "Proposals from Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have raised concerns from economists and business leaders who fear the plans would sap economic growth.", "authors": ["Alan Rappeport", "Thomas Kaplan"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/30/business/00WEALTHTAX-01/merlin_161835201_c381f6cb-f6b0-4815-8e9e-25baef21bcec-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
