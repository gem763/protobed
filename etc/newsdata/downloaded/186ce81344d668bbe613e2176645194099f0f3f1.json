As NPR's Shanghai Correspondent Rob Schmitz has reported previously, Taiwan split from China in 1949 when the U.S.-supported Chinese nationalist leadership fled after losing a civil war to communist forces.\n\nThen-president of Taiwan Chiang Ching-Kuo turned down Beijing's olive branch in 1979, reports Reuters, and later that year came out with the \"Three-Noes Policy\": no contact, no compromise and no negotiation with China.\n\nDecades later, China has again been rebuffed.\n\nIn response to Xi's speech, current president since 2016, Tsai Ing-wen said Wednesday that Taiwan would not accept Beijing's offered arrangement of \"one country, two systems,\" reports Reuters. In her own speech just the day before, Tsai, who is member of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, urged China to respect Taiwan's democratic values.\n\nMore than 70 percent of Taiwanese believe Taiwan is already an independent country, according to an analysis done by The Washington Post. Unification with China has also become unpopular, the Post reports only one-third of Taiwanese citizens want to be part of China against \u2014 a drop from 60 percent who supported is in 2003.\n\nOnly about 20 countries across the globe recognize Taiwan as a sovereign nation, which means different governments from Latin America to Africa have become drawn into the long-running diplomatic spat over the years. The U.S., which does not recognize Taiwan as independent from China, is no exception. While the State Department says the U.S. enjoys \"a robust unofficial relationship\" with Taiwan, right after his inauguration President Donald Trump called Xi and promised that Washington would stick to the \"One China\" doctrine. Then just a little over a year later, the U.S. dedicated a new complex for the American Institute in Taiwan, which has long functioned as the de facto U.S. Embassy in Taiwan, NPR previously reported.\n\nThough he didn't name any country specifically, Xi warned Wednesday against foreign interference in China's \"Taiwan issue,\" saying family matters should be resolved by family members, reports the AP.", "description": "Independence of Taiwan is \"a dead end,\" China President Xi Jinping said Wednesday during a speech marking the 40th anniversary of when Beijing sent a message to Taiwan calling for unification.", "authors": ["Ashley Westerman"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/01/02/gettyimages-1076533532_wide-e649845e8a8fdd43130b96eae127dccabbab1a39.jpg?s=1400"}
