REUTERS/Matthias Rietschel\n\nThe German economy is expected to contract slightly in the third quarter as it did in the April-June period as exports weaken on uncertainties linked to Britain\u2019s planned departure from the European Union as well as trade conflicts.\n\nThe technical recession expected in the third quarter will come after nine successive years of growth, fueled by an export boom mainly to China and more recently a consumption-driven cycle supported by low interest rates in the euro zone.\n\n\u201cA stronger slowdown or a pronounced recession are not to be expected at the moment,\u201d the ministry said. \u201cThe export-oriented German industry is facing weak global trade, stagnating global manufacturing and falling demand for cars.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe German economy remains in stagnation,\u201d it added. \u201cEconomic activity is stuck at the existing level.\u201d\n\nEconomists have voiced concern that the slowdown in manufacturing would sooner or later spread to other sectors of Europe\u2019s biggest economy, whose robust labor market is starting to feel the effects of the drag.\n\nThe ministry said that growth in services and construction was largely compensating for a recession in the export-dependent manufacturing sector.\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s coalition government of conservatives and social democrats has resisted calls for a stimulus package to counter the slowdown.\n\nGermany\u2019s leading economic institutes have slashed their growth forecasts, predicting an expansion of 0.5% this year and 1.1% in 2020.\n\nThe government will publish its growth forecasts this week. In April, it predicted growth of 0.5% for 2019 and 1.5% for 2020.", "description": "The German economy is unlikely to slide into a prolonged recession even as it languishes in a weak growth cycle, the Economy Ministry said on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440662577&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D0PG", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
