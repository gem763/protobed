Elizabeth Warren posted false advertisements to Facebook on Saturday to see if she could prove to voters that the social media platform values profit over facts.\n\nInterested in Elizabeth Warren?

They\u2019ve decided to let political figures lie to you -- even about Facebook itself -- while their executives and their investors get even richer off the ads containing these lies,\" Warren wrote in a series of Twitter posts criticizing Facebook and its founder, Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nEthan Miller/Getty Images\n\nThe ads, publicly sponsored by the Warren campaign, claim Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg endorsed President Donald Trump for reelection, showing a photo of Trump and Zuckerberg in the Oval Office. Then the ads immediately take it back, ironically slamming Zuckerberg for giving politicians free reign to post false information.\n\n\"You're probably shocked, and you might be thinking, 'how could this possibly be true?' Well, it's not,\" the ads say. \"But what Zuckerberg has done is given Donald Trump free reign to lie on his platform -- and then to pay Facebook gobs of money to push out their lies to American voters.\"\n\nWe intentionally made a Facebook ad with false claims and submitted it to Facebook\u2019s ad platform to see if it\u2019d be approved. It got approved quickly and the ad is now running on Facebook.

She said many of the ads Facebook approves are ones TV stations won't even air.\n\n\"Once again, we\u2019re seeing Facebook throw its hands up to battling misinformation in the political discourse, because when profit comes up against protecting democracy, Facebook chooses profit,\" Warren wrote.\n\nShe added, \"Facebook just takes the cash, no questions asked.\"\n\nOnce again, we\u2019re seeing Facebook throw its hands up to battling misinformation in the political discourse, because when profit comes up against protecting democracy, Facebook chooses profit. \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 12, 2019\n\nThis isn't the first rift between the lawmaker and Facebook.\n\nIn March, Warren unveiled her plans to break up \"big tech\" companies. Through the policy, Warren would \"unwind tech mergers that illegally undermine competition \" -- citing Amazon for its takeover of Whole Foods, Facebook for its takeover of WhatsApp and Instagram and Google's for its takeover of the mapping app Waze.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s big tech companies have too much power -- too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy,\u201d Warren said in a statement. \u201cThey\u2019ve bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else.\u201d\n\nSamuel Corum/Getty Images, FILE\n\nZuckerberg said he would \"go to the mat\" and fight for his company against Warren's policy, according to audio leaked Oct. 1 from a July Q&A session with Facebook employees at company headquarters.\n\n\"Does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don\u2019t want to have a major lawsuit against our own government ... We care about our country and want to work with our government and do good things,\" Zuckerberg said in the audio. \"But look, at the end of the day, if someone\u2019s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.\"\n\nWarren expressed concerns on Twitter that she believes Facebook holds power not just over the social media market, but also the political conversation surrounding the 2020 election. And as the fourth Democratic debate nears and early-voting states are paying closer attention to the candidates, she said letting false claims circulate is dangerous.\n\n\"Facebook already helped elect Donald Trump once through negligence,\" she tweeted. \"Now, they've changed their policy so they can profit from lies to the American people.\"\n\nA sign-up sheet was created on her campaign website to give voters what she called a chance to \"hold Mark Zuckerberg accountable.\"", "description": "Massachusetts Sen.
