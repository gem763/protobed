Our aim was for something sleeker, simpler and easier to read while on the move. We hope you like it.\n\nWe believe that the new design reflects the core of our mission. We want to take you somewhere new no matter where in the world you are. For us, this means stepping outside of the 24-hour news cycle. Beyond soundbites. Away from information overload.\n\nWe want to provide you with space: the space to slow down and delve deep, take the long view and consider new perspectives. Whether we\u2019re writing about food or language, climate change or relationships, we believe no topic is too small to be fascinating or too overwhelming to tackle. But what every BBC Future story has in common is evidence-based analysis, original thinking, and powerful storytelling. These are big goals, but I think we can say we\u2019ve achieved them \u2013 as shown by the numerous awards won by both our website and our team, including the 2019 Webby Award for best writing and the 2019 Lovie Award for best writing.\n\nWhere do we go from here? Going even bigger, bolder and better. We have a lot of exciting ideas coming up \u2013 and this redesign is just the start.\n\nTake the new series that we\u2019re launching this week (and over the weeks to come). In our Invisible Numbers series, for example, we look at the numbers and equations that shape our lives\u2026 without most of us being any the wiser. (Think pi, only even more powerful.)\n\nIn Missed Genius, we tell the compelling stories of some of the world\u2019s greatest thinkers who have been overlooked, side-lined or forgotten, even if their contributions live on.\n\nIn Weird West, we investigate some of the everyday habits of Western, Educated, Industrialised, Rich and Democratic (or Weird) countries and look at how other places do them differently. This week\u2019s story, for example, focuses on how showering in the morning is a common Weird practice, but one that\u2019s far from universal \u2013 and may not always be the cleanest. What do these habits teach us about ourselves, no matter where we\u2019re from?\n\nAnd in How to Think, we explore big topics that tend to be thought about in certain ways (such as the future, or capitalism). We investigate not only why we think about them the way we do \u2013 but if there\u2019s a better way.\n\nAt BBC Future, we also believe in shining a light on the hidden ways the world is changing and providing solutions for how to navigate it. To that end, our senior journalist Martha Henriques is off to the Arctic this month, one of a handful of reporters selected to join a six-week scientific mission on an icebreaking ship. She\u2019ll be exploring how the Arctic is changing in her series Frozen North. Meanwhile, after our extremely popular story on \u201cflight shame\u201d, we\u2019ll be looking at other ways in which we\u2019re responding to our changing planet as part of our new series Climate Emotions.\n\nBut it\u2019s far from doom and gloom. Our team feels genuinely optimistic about the future. We know many of you do, too. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve always believed in solutions journalism as a way to explore the ideas that are out there. And, because we refuse to accept common belief \u2013 and because only by asking \u201cwhy\u201d will we ever improve on the solutions that are out there \u2013 we\u2019ll be critiquing them, too. This week, you\u2019ll hear about a couple more ideas in the sustainability pipeline: electric airliners and car-free cities.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that the world is a challenging place. But we also believe that, now more than ever before, it\u2019s a world full of potential for each one of us \u2013 and humanity as a whole. And to unlock it, we all need to take the time to think, to analyse, and to imagine. We hope BBC Future can be your home for doing just that.\n\nAmanda Ruggeri, editor of BBC Future", "description": "Our award-winning site has gotten a new look \u2014\u00a0while at its core, we continue to shine a light on a changing world.", "authors": ["Amanda Ruggeri"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/7p/vt/p07pvth8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
