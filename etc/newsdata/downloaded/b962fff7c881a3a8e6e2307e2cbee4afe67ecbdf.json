Last month, Boeing\u2019s board made public the findings of its own review of the company\u2019s policies, recommending changes to the design of future airplanes and a restructuring of its engineering group.\n\n\u201cBoeing\u2019s leadership team is committed to our enduring values of safety, quality, and integrity as they implement the board\u2019s recommendations and additional actions to strengthen and elevate safety,\u201d a Boeing spokesman said in a statement on Saturday to The Times.\n\nBehind closed doors, questions have also been raised among top executives about how Kevin McAllister, the head of Boeing\u2019s commercial division, which produced the troubled plane, has managed the Max crisis, according to several people familiar with internal discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation. Mr. McAllister joined Boeing in November 2016, after the development of the Max was largely completed but before it had been certified by regulators.\n\nHe has been the focus of criticism from Boeing executives who worry that he has not been proactive enough in reaching out to airlines to explain what steps the company is taking in the wake of the two accidents, according to the people familiar with the matter.\n\nMr. McAllister had previously worked at General Electric with Mr. Calhoun, the board\u2019s new chairman, who was key in his hiring at Boeing. The commercial division, Boeing\u2019s largest business, is facing problems beyond the Max, including manufacturing issues at its Charleston plant, cracking on the Max\u2019s predecessor, the 737 NG, and the discovery of foreign objects inside the KC-46 tanker, a military aircraft that is built by the group.", "description": "The decision to strip Dennis Muilenburg of his chairman title culminated months of internal debate over whether to hold top executives accountable after the 737 Max crashes.", "authors": ["Natalie Kitroeff", "David Gelles"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/11/business/0boeing1/0boeing1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
