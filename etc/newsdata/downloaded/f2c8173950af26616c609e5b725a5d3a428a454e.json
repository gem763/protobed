Traders Brush Off Turkey Sanctions, But Warn Worse Could Come\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Investors in Turkish markets brushed off Monday night\u2019s U.S. sanctions, though some warned that harsher penalties could still come.\n\nThe strengthened as much as 1% before paring gains to 0.2%, trading at 5.9142 per dollar as of 11:48 a.m. in Istanbul. Turkey\u2019s main climbed 1.5%. Those moves only partially eroded losses that have made Turkish assets among the worst performers in emerging markets this month.\n\nSince President Donald Trump warned on Oct. 7 that he could \u201cobliterate\u201d Turkey\u2019s economy if Ankara did anything he considered \u201coff limits\u201d with its incursion into Syria, traders have braced for sanctions that would deal a severe blow to the Turkish financial system.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a short-term relief,\u201d said Piotr Matys, a strategist at Rabobank in London. \u201cThe risk that far more consequential and punitive measures could be used by the U.S. prevails as the military operation in northern Syria continues.\u201d\n\nFor now, Washington is sanctioning three senior Turkish officials and increasing steel tariffs. The penalties may have little impact on the wider economy and are in line with measures adopted last year, which were subsequently removed as relations between the NATO allies improved.\n\nMuch depends on how Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan responds. On Monday, he said the offensive in Syria would continue no matter what.\n\n\u201cI fear that Erdogan will not be able to help himself, and we will see retaliation,\u201d said Timothy Ash, a strategist at BlueBay Asset Management in London. \u201cIf they decide to respond, tit for tat, it could get ugly with a game of escalation between the two sides.\u201d\n\nThe sell-off this month has created opportunities for investors brave enough to jump in. Real yields on Turkish local-currency government bonds have climbed to the highest level in a year. The Index of equities fell more than 5% on Monday and touched it\u2019s lowest level since June.", "description": "Traders Brush Off Turkey Sanctions, But Warn Worse Could Come", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEBBD0T0_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
