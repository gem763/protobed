He could not identify who was behind the strikes or if they were carried out by warplanes or a drone.\n\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights confirmed the death of al-Muhajir, saying he was among five ISIL members who were killed in a US-led operation backed by the SDF.\n\n191027132540524\n\nLater, in a post on Twitter, SDF spokesman Mustefa Bali said: \"We believe ISIS spox. Al-Muhajir was in Jarablus to facilitate Baghdadi's entry to Euphrates Shield area,\" referring to a zone in northern Syria controlled by Turkey's Syria proxies.\n\n\"The two US-led operations have effectively disabled top ISIS leadership who were hiding\" in northwest Syria. \"More still remain hiding in the same area,\" Bali said.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, US President Donald Trump said al-Baghdadi was killed in a daring, night time raid by US special forces deep in northwest Syria.\n\nTrump said that US forces killed a \"large number\" of ISIL fighters during the raid, which culminated in Baghdadi cornered in a dead-end tunnel along with three of his children, where he detonated a suicide vest.\n\nThe operation to kill al-Baghdadi took place near a small village in northwest Syria called Barisha, more than 100 kilometres (62 miles) west of Ain al-Baydah.\n\nThe special operations mission included eight helicopters descending on the compound where he had been holed up amid gunfire that Trump said was \"immediately terminated\" by US gunships.\n\nThe ISIL \"caliphate\" was eradicated in March, nearly five years after it was proclaimed by al-Baghdadi, largely reducing the group's fighters to scattered sleeper cells.", "description": "Abu Hassan al-Muhajir was killed in Ain al-Baydah village in coordinated operation between US and SDF intelligence.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/28/186c9605e22f4183b15cc43edb4a1505_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
