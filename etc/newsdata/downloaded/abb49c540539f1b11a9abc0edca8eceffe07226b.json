For some, this seems like an impossible task.\n\n\u201cTrying to create a perfect world or be a perfect consumer is not at all realistic,\u201d says Dr. Ellis Jones, author of \u201cThe Better World Shopping Guide\u201d and assistant professor of sociology at College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts. \u201cWe just have to try our best to practice and get better at navigating this so that collectively, our dollars start moving things in the right direction.\u201d\n\nShopping ethically starts with educating yourself and supporting the products and companies that align with your values. Here\u2019s what you can do to become a more ethical consumer.\n\n1. Check certifications and ratings\n\nLabels such as \u201cFair Trade Certified\u201d or \u201cUSDA Organic\u201d signify that a product\u2019s supply chain has gone through some level of vetting. However, standards can vary widely.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that those labels are meaningless, it\u2019s that their meaning has been watered down,\u201d Jones says. \u201cMost consumers don\u2019t have enough information to know whether that particular fair trade certification, organic certification or sustainable seafood certification is a weak one or a strong one.\u201d\n\nJones considers the B Corporation Certification, which companies such as Patagonia and Seventh Generation have earned, the current gold standard. It takes a comprehensive look not just at products, but at entire companies\u2019 social and environmental impacts. This includes assessing factors like energy usage and workers\u2019 wages. But the rigorous certification process makes this label harder to find.\n\nIn general, Jones says the more seals or certifications a product or company has, the better. When in doubt, turn to third-party organizations for guidance. For example, the Cornucopia Institute, a nonprofit watchdog group, rates farms and manufacturers of items like yogurt, eggs and toothpaste.\n\n2. Shop less often\n\nOverconsumption takes a toll on our wallets and the planet. Before buying something, think about whether you really need it. If you do, look for options that have a lesser impact, says Casey Taylor, a partner in Bain and Company\u2019s retail practice. Investing in reusable, high-quality or easy-to-repair items can help minimize purchases.\n\nAlso see: You spend 41% more at the supermarket if you keep checking your phone\n\n\u201cInstead of buying a new shirt from a fast-fashion retailer, you might think about buying used or buying pieces that\u2019ll last longer,\u201d Taylor says.\n\n3. Seek secondhand goods\n\nWhen you choose previously owned items, you aren\u2019t contributing to the labor and materials needed to make new goods. Check thrift shops, garage sales and community groups like the Freecycle Network for inexpensive \u2014 or free \u2014 finds. Another sustainable solution? Rent clothes through services like Le Tote and Rent the Runway.\n\n4. Choose slower online deliveries\n\nRetailers like Amazon AMZN, -1.50% have made selecting fast shipping a reflex, but it\u2019s not always the most ethical option. When shopping online, choosing standard shipping over same-day or next-day delivery can ensure multiple items in an order ship together.\n\nRelated: Investors worried about climate change take aim at companies from Amazon to Taco Bell\n\n\u201cFor the environment, it reduces packaging and the number of drop-offs, and for customers, it\u2019s just one less box that you need to recycle,\u201d Taylor says.\n\nBetter yet, shop in person or buy online and pick up in store.\n\n5. Shop locally\n\nVisit your neighborhood bakery or farmers market rather than a large chain. Supporting local businesses or buying locally grown produce is generally better for the environment because it decreases the distance that products have to travel, Taylor says. It also gives consumers the opportunity to ask merchants directly for details about how products are sourced and made.\n\n6. Pick a responsible financial institution\n\nFinancial institutions and products are part of the equation, too, Jones says. You can search for a bank or credit union that\u2019s committed to social and environmental values. Community development financial institutions, for example, help underserved consumers build credit and acquire loans.\n\nSome credit cards automatically donate to charitable causes like nature conservation and cancer research with every purchase. Consider applying for one that donates to causes important to you.\n\n7. Be prepared\n\nFind small ways to make the ethical choice the easy choice. You can reduce waste by keeping reusable shopping bags or a coffee cup in the car or by the front door. That way, you\u2019ll have them when you need them.\n\nYou might like: Vegetarian diets can\u2019t save Earth, but eating less meat might\n\n\u201cSimple choices add up if you think about the number of times that you walk into a store or pop by a coffee shop,\u201d Taylor says.\n\nDeveloping positive habits takes practice. But with a little effort, shopping ethically can become second nature.\n\nMore from NerdWallet:", "description": "Being socially responsible is sometimes overwhelming.
