But many experts blame the \"drug war\" for spiraling violence in Mexico, as fragmented cartels fight each other and the army.\n\n\"We're going to continue with our strategy,\" Lopez Obrador told a news conference.\n\n\"I'm optimistic, I believe we are going to achieve peace in this country... It's a process, we're moving forward.\"\n\nHe repeated his pledge to fight crime at its roots by improving living standards for Mexico's poorest, and blamed previous administrations for \"trying to fight violence with violence.\"\n\nMore than 250,000 people have been murdered in Mexico since the army was deployed to the streets in 2006, including a record 33,749 last year.\n\nWith 23,063 murders as of August, 2019 is on track to again break the country's homicide record.\n\nThe federal government initially said 14 officers were killed in the Aguililla attack, but state authorities put the toll at 13.", "description": "President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador defended his strategy Tuesday for fighting the violent crime wracking Mexico, as relatives mourned 13 police officers killed in an ambush claimed by a powerful drug cartel, while a separate shootout left 15 dead.
