Thank you!\u201d\n\nHolding the event at his own property would have violated at least one and possibly both of the Constitution\u2019s emolument clauses. One prohibits the president from receiving money from foreign entities, and the other prohibits him from getting money from the federal government or any state beyond his salary. Federal law also prohibits federal \u201cofficers\u201d and employees from giving themselves federal contracts.\n\nOn its face, Trump\u2019s insistence on giving himself a massive government contract was literally a dictionary definition of corruption \u2013 using one\u2019s office to enrich oneself.\n\n\u201cHe is the most corrupt president in modern times,\u201d said Jennifer Horn, a former chair of the New Hampshire Republican Party.\n\nWhite House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney on Thursday announced the Doral decision, claiming that of all the possible locations all over the country, Trump\u2019s property was the best suited for the international conference.\n\nThe decision drew immediate fire from ethics groups, Democrats, a fair number of Republicans and even some European leaders who would be attending. Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, said it was \u201cnot at all\u201d appropriate for public money to be going into Trump\u2019s pocket.\n\nTrump\u2019s Saturday night tweets announcing the decision also belie his January 2017 promise that he would separate himself from his family business, the Trump Organization, which operates the resorts and hotels that he continues to own through a trust he created after winning the 2016 election.\n\nTrump\u2019s staff has continued to repeat that false claim, and in fact used it to argue that Trump really could not benefit from holding the G-7 at Doral.\n\n\u201cThe president has no involvement in the Trump Organization anymore,\u201d White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham told HuffPost on Friday.\n\nTrump, however, wrote on Twitter: \u201cI announced that I would be willing to do it at NO PROFIT or, if legally permissible, at ZERO COST to the USA,\u201d suggesting he personally still fully controls his business.\n\nI thought I was doing something very good for our Country by using Trump National Doral, in Miami, for hosting the G-7 Leaders. It is big, grand, on hundreds of acres, next to MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, has tremendous ballrooms & meeting rooms, and each delegation would have... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 20, 2019\n\n.....its own 50 to 70 unit building. Would set up better than other alternatives. I announced that I would be willing to do it at NO PROFIT or, if legally permissible, at ZERO COST to the USA. But, as usual, the Hostile Media & their Democrat Partners went CRAZY! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 20, 2019\n\n....Therefore, based on both Media & Democrat Crazed and Irrational Hostility, we will no longer consider Trump National Doral, Miami, as the Host Site for the G-7 in 2020. We will begin the search for another site, including the possibility of Camp David, immediately. Thank you! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 20, 2019\n\nDoral, although located in Miami-Dade County, is far from what most visitors imagine when they think of Miami. The beaches are miles away through terrible traffic, and the close-by runways of Miami International Airport mean large, noisy jets take off or land overhead from dawn until past midnight.\n\nDuring the Republican National Committee\u2019s spring meeting there in 2018, the resort itself appeared in need of basic maintenance. Guest rooms smelled of mildew and the basement restaurant had the odor of stale, spilled beer.\n\nThe G-7 meeting of the world\u2019s largest democratic economies rotates among its members. Next year\u2019s meeting will be hosted by the United States, and Mulvaney announced on Thursday that of all the possible places in the country that could have hosted it, Trump\u2019s Doral golf course was the best choice.\n\nTrump himself gave a long advertisement for the resort during an August news conference at the conclusion of this year\u2019s G-7 in France. \u201cWith Doral, we have a series of magnificent buildings. We call them bungalows,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey each hold from 50 to 70 very luxurious rooms with magnificent views. We have incredible conference rooms, incredible restaurants.\u201d\n\nIn his most recent financial disclosure form filed this May, Trump claimed receiving $81,417,193 in \u201cincome\u201d from the Doral resort over the previous year. It\u2019s unclear how accurate that is, given Trump\u2019s tendency to file widely varying figures to different government authorities.\n\nHe told the U.S. Office of Government Ethics in his 2018 financial disclosure, for example, that his Scotland golf courses are worth more than $50 million each, even as he told United Kingdom authorities that they had a combined net debt of $65 million.\n\nIn any case, money spent at Trump hotels and golf courses flows directly to Trump personally, as he is the sole beneficiary of a trust that now owns his family business. Because Trump insists on playing golf at his own properties, American taxpayers have already been the source for at least many hundreds of thousands of dollars that have gone to the Trump Organization in the form of room, meal and other expenses for Secret Service agents and other government employees who have stayed on-site with Trump in Florida, New Jersey, Scotland and Ireland.", "description": "President Donald Trump made the decision to hold the summit somewhere else instead of his Miami resort in response to mounting criticism.", "authors": ["Senior White House Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5dabc297210000621bad3503.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
