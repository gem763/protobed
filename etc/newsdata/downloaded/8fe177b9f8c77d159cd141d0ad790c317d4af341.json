I watched in all those transcripts of what people have been saying inside the investigation \u2014 Volker and others \u2014 there was no quid pro quo,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nOn Thursday, Mulvaney undercut Trump\u2019s central defense of his months-long efforts to convince Kiev to launch an investigation into a conspiracy theory positing that a computer server belonging to the Democratic National Committee resided in Ukraine.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy during a news conference on Capitol Hill on Friday. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) More\n\n\u201cDid he also mention to me in the past that the corruption related to the DNC server?\u201d Mulvaney told reporters in reference to conversations he had with Trump about Ukrainian corruption. \u201cAbsolutely. No question about that. But that\u2019s it, and that\u2019s why we held up the money.\u201d\n\nABC News reporter Jonathan Karl noted that withholding $400 million in military aid in exchange for investigations into the U.S. election was, in fact, the very definition of quid pro quo, to which Mulvaney responded, \u201cWe do that all the time with foreign policy.\u201d\n\nFollowing Mulvaney\u2019s briefing, administration officials inside the Justice Department and the White House reacted with shock to the remarks, the Wall Street Journal reported. According to the report, Trump initially thought Mulvaney\u2019s combative performance had gone over well, but was persuaded that his chief of staff needed to walk back his comments. Shortly thereafter, Mulvaney released a statement in which he reversed himself, saying, \u201cThere was never any condition on the flow of aid related to the matter of the DNC server.\u201d\n\nAt McCarthy\u2019s Friday news conference, a reporter noted that Mulvaney \u201csaid one thing in the press conference, and the exact opposite in his statement,\u201d and asked the House GOP leader, \u201cSo which one do you believe?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think Mick Mulvaney clarified his statement to be very clear. I take Mick Mulvaney at his word for clarification,\u201d McCarthy answered.\n\nA third reporter then asked McCarthy whether Mulvaney\u2019s press conference had helped the president\u2019s defense that there had not been a quid pro quo floated to Ukrainian officials.\n\n\u201cI think Mick was very clear in cleaning up his statement,\u201d McCarthy answered, \u201cthat there was no quid pro quo.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters that acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney was \"very clear in cleaning up his statement\" on whether President Trump floated a quid pro quo to Ukrainian leaders.", "authors": ["David Knowles"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6Qu4uA6gBalR_oeNSUFbqA--~B/aD0zMTQ5O3c9NDcyNDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/6869d3f0-f1c8-11e9-bee4-cd8f07f94519", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
