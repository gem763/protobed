The Trump administration also has tried to end TPS for people from Sudan, Haiti, and Nicaragua, among others. A federal judge has blocked the administration after a lawsuit was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to El Salvador Ronald Johnson made the announcement about TPS with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele in a video tweet.\n\n\"This is recognition of the achievements and good work of the government of Nayib Bukele,\" Johnson said.\n\nBut in a discordant note, the acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Ken Cuccinelli disputed that the administration is extending TPS for Salvadorans.\n\n\"A clarification: some reporting has spoken of 'extending TPS,' \" Cuccinelli said in a tweet. \"That has important legal meaning, and that's not what happened w/ the agreements. Rather, work permits for Salvadorans will be extended for 1 year past resolution of litigation for an orderly wind down period.\"\n\nThe TPS announcement came as part of a larger message about \"greater collaboration on information sharing, border and aviation security, and international diplomacy\" between the two countries. U.S. officials will \"advise and mentor their El Salvadoran national police, border security, immigration, and customs counterparts,\" with an emphasis on the collection and sharing of biometric data.\n\nLast month, the U.S. and El Salvador announced another agreement to stem the tide of migrants trying to reach the U.S. by sending asylum seekers to El Salvador. At the time, it was not clear that El Salvador's cooperation on asylum would be linked to any other bilateral issue, such as the status of Salvadoran TPS holders in the U.S.\n\nThe administration still seeks to repatriate Salvadorans in \"an orderly and responsible process,\" the DHS statement said.\n\n\"However, a sudden inflow of 250,000 individuals to El Salvador could spark another mass migration to the U.S. and reinvigorate the crisis at the southern border.\"", "description": "A month after signing an agreement with El Salvador to cooperate in limiting asylum seekers at the southern border, the U.S. extends protections for Salvadorans to legally work in the U.S.", "authors": ["Richard Gonzales"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/28/ap_19241018257196_wide-f0aaf22f873ad85f2576cde593b54c5f3c779468.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
