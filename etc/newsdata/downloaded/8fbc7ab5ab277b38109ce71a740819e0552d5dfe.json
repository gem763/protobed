Rep Insists Adam Schiff Is 'Fact Based' and Doesn\u2019t 'Have Any Agenda' For Impeachment Inquiry", "language": "en", "text": "Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) defended the way House Democrats are handling the impeachment inquiry into President Trump, specifically praising Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA).\n\n\"I think we have to be deliberate, fact based. We need to make sure that we\u2019re methodical,\" Khanna told CNN on Tuesday. \"We shouldn\u2019t just be throwing out character assassination and we should make this about, not the president\u2019s personality, we should make this about protecting our constitution and making sure no person can ask a foreign leader to investigate their rival.\"\n\nCNN anchor Poppy Harlow asked if he thinks any of his fellow Democrats are not acting in a deliberate way.\n\n\"No, I\u2019m not \u2014 I don\u2019t think that. I\u2019m just saying the approach we should take. And I actually believe Chairman Schiff has been taking that approach,\" Khanna replied. \"He\u2019s methodical, he's fact based. He doesn\u2019t personalize it. He doesn\u2019t have any agenda...He\u2019s really doing his job and I think that is the approach that's going to serve us well.\"\n\nHouse Republicans have heavily criticized the way Democrats are conducting the inquiry. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), the ranking member of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, said Schiff is trying to hide the process by doing the inquiry in the basement of the Capitol building behind closed doors.\n\n\"We can\u2019t see the transcripts. He selectively leaks part of the transcripts and oh, in the interviews, no White House lawyers can be there. No agency lawyers can be there. The State Department can\u2019t have lawyers there. The minority isn\u2019t given subpoena authority. We can\u2019t get the witnesses we may want to call to get the information for the American people,\" Jordan told Fox News on Monday.\n\n\n\n", "description": ".10/22/2019 16:37:04PM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Guy Benson", "Cortney O'Brien", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/116/3f9ac008-e6bb-4161-875a-12e93bc0b5a7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
