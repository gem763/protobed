In that scenario, the deadlock would be settled by total points difference in the pool matches, with Ireland then guaranteed one of the top two slots.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

If Scotland win that game with no bonus points for either side, they would go above Japan on their head-to-head result. If Japan gain a losing bonus point and Scotland fail to claim a bonus point, Japan would finish above the Scots and advance to the knockout stage in first or second place.\n\nWhile victory or a draw for Japan would seal top spot, they could also go through as pool winners if they lose to Scotland by seven points or less but score four tries, delivering a rare but not impossible two bonus points.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Rugby World Cup team of round three 1/16 Team of round three From Scotland's demolition of Samoa to France's narrow escape against Tonga, who makes the team of round three? AFP via Getty Images 2/16 1. James Slipper (Australia) Ninety-three Tests had come and gone for the Wallabies loosehead, but it was 94th-time lucky for the Queensland-born prop as he finally scored his first international try in Australia\u2019s 45-10 victory over Uruguay. Getty Images 3/16 2. Mbongeni Mbonambi (South Africa) Mbonambi was excellent at the lineout, finding his jumper on every occasion, but it was his work around the pitch that really stood out in the win over Italy as he bagged himself a try in the process. PA 4/16 3. Angus Ta\u2019avao (New Zealand) The rookie All Blacks prop was thrust into the contest against Namibia early when his team were struggling to break down the African side following Nepo Laulala\u2019s yellow card, but not only did he settle straight into the match, he immediately bagged himself a try that convinced Steve Hansen to leave him on for the rest of the match. Getty Images 5/16 4. Wimpie van der Walt (Japan) The uniquely-named lock led Japan\u2019s defensive charge against Samoa and was dominant in the aerial battle with a 100 per cent lineout effort alongside James Moore, which was made all the more impressive as he didn\u2019t start either of their opening matches. AFP via Getty Images 6/16 5. Sam Whitelock (New Zealand) Captained New Zealand in the absence of Kieran Read and led by example. Whitelock bagged a try himself, didn\u2019t panic when New Zealand were clawed back in the first half and contributed well with the ball in hand. His aggression in kicking for the corner early on paid off with a 71-point return. EPA 7/16 6. Rhys Ruddock (Ireland) Ireland may have been criticised for a drab performance in their victory over Russia, but Ruddock proved the silver lining with a man-of-the-match display that could thrust him into the side for the big contests. AFP via Getty Images 8/16 7. Sam Underhill (England) Another flanker named man of the match, Underhill was England\u2019s defensive heartbeat against Argentina, but also an emphatic carrier who helped set up George Ford\u2019s bonus point-clinching try. PA 9/16 8. Kazuki Himeno (Japan) The Japanese No 8 was one of their top performers against Samoa, carrying well and showing a deft touch with his ability to offload from the tackle. Earmarked as a real star of Japanese rugby, he looks to have real captaincy potential. AFP via Getty Images 10/16 9. Frank Lomani (Fiji) A livewire showing as the beating heart of a Flying Fijian side back at full strength and firing on all cylinders. Scored a try himself and delivered the quick ball that the Pacific Islanders crave to play their unique brand of rugby. AP 11/16 10. Jordie Barrett (New Zealand) Stepped out of the shadow of older brother Beauden to play a starring role in the demolition of Namibia. Scored a try himself but it was the in which he created Anton Lienert-Brown\u2019s score that really stood out, combining power, vision, passing ability and athletic determination to send the centre over. Getty Images 12/16 11. Semi Radradra (Fiji) The star of the side this week. When Radradra is playing his best rugby he is simply unstoppable, and so he proved last week. The Bordeaux back scored twice against Georgia and led pretty much every attacking stats list as the European side failed to shackle is delightful talent. AP 13/16 12. Anton Lienert-Brown (New Zealand) His form is keeping Sonny Bill Williams out of the Test side when New Zealand play their crunch fixtures, but on the weekend\u2019s evidence it was easy to see why. Two tries, the first an eye-catching mazy run from halfway, secures him the No 12 shirt this week, and probably for the All Blacks in the quarter-finals. Getty Images 14/16 13. Timothy Lafaele (Japan) Kicked off the performance against Samoa with their first try, starring with teammate Kotaro Matsushima to tear the Pacific Islanders apart early on and pave the way to their bonus-point victory. AFP via Getty Images 15/16 14. Cheslin Kolbe (South Africa) How do you stop him? The answer is yet to be found, with Kolbe\u2019s low centre of gravity, stunning footwork and Habana-like pace leaving team after team in knots \u2013 this time Italy \u2013 with two tries to kick-start his tally at this World Cup. AFP via Getty Images 16/16 15. Elliot Daly (England) Possibly his best performance for England in the No 15 shirt to date, Daly linked up superbly with Jonny May \u2013 who is hard done by not to make the side this week \u2013 and Anthony Watson in what was a scintillating first half for the English back three.

Getty Images\n\nAssuming Scotland take the maximum five points against Russia, they could reach the quarter-finals with a bonus-point win against Japan provided they deny the host nation a bonus point themselves.\n\nFour years ago Japan won three games but finished third in their pool because of bonus points, pipped to qualification by Scotland and South Africa - the only time a team has won three pool matches and not progressed.\n\nLikely outcome: Ireland to qualify. Too close to call on who joins them.\n\nPOOL B\n\nNew Zealand and South Africa look highly likely to go through in first and second place respectively, but nothing is secure yet.\n\nSouth Africa's (10) progress will be guaranteed if they collect a bonus-point victory over Canada (0) on Tuesday while New Zealand (14), who have never lost a pool game, would top the group with victory in their last game against Italy (10).\n\nIf Italy pull off a shock victory with no bonus points for either team, they could advance by virtue of their head-to-head record. But if Italy, New Zealand and South Africa all end on 14 points it would be the same scenario as in group A, with overall points difference the deciding factor, which would leave Italy almost no chance of advancing.\n\nLikely outcome: Wins for New Zealand, who would finish top, and South Africa, who would go through as runners-up.\n\nPOOL C\n\nEngland (15) and France (13) are both through to the last eight and their Pool C encounter on Saturday will decide who tops the group.\n\nPOOL D\n\nAustralia (11) will advance with victory against Georgia (5) on Oct. 11 but would be through before then if Wales (9) beat Fiji (7) on Wednesday. That would send Wales through, with the chance of securing top spot with victory over Uruguay (4) in their final game.\n\nShould Fiji beat Wales, as they did in 2007, then they, Wales, Australia and Georgia would all still have a chance.\n\nBut even if Fiji triumph, Wales would be likely to win their last game against Uruguay to ensure qualification. Australia would be expected to beat Georgia, so the top two positions could be decided on by bonus points. If Wales and Australia finish on the same points total, Wales would be top thanks to their victory over the Wallabies.\n\nLikely outcome: Wales to win last two games and top the group ahead of Australia.\n\nQuarter-finals\n\nOct. 19 Winner Pool C v Runner-up Pool D\n\nWinner Pool B v Runner-up Pool A\n\nOct. 20 Winner Pool D v Runner-up Pool C\n\nWinner Pool A v Runner-up Pool B\n\nSemi-finals\n\nOct. 26 Winner QF1 v Winner QF2\n\nOct. 27 Winner QF3 v Winner QF4\n\nNov. 1 Third place playoff\n\nNov. 2 Final\n\nPA", "description": "A look at the quarter-final qualification scenarios as teams enter the final week of pool-stage action at the Rugby World Cup\u00a0(current pool points totals in brackets).", "authors": ["Mitch Phillips"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/08/07/Yokohama-Stadium.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
