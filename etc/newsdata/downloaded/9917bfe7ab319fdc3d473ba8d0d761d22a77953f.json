Lady Mary Crawley, a key member of the movie\u2019s central family, was wondering whether the time had come to sell the grand British estate\u2014a house roughly the size of a cruise ship, home to a handful of aristocrats and their army of servants. Maybe, Mary mused from her dressing-table chair, as she was getting primped and groomed by her personal maid, the family should move to a more reasonably-sized large manor and turn Downton into something useful, like a school.\n\nBut the maid begged Lady Mary to keep Downton in the family forever, a symbol of glory and honor for the staff and the surrounding town. This was what the little people wanted: aristocracy!\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAnd there you have it, the overarching message of the film that topped the U.S. box office last weekend, beating out Rambo: Last Blood, Brad Pitt\u2019s new space flick Ad Astra and It: Chapter Two. Granted, the success of Downton Abbey owes something to nostalgia, the power of all-American Anglophilia and the comic stylings of supporting actress Dame Maggie Smith. But the movie\u2019s appeal is still a little vexing. At a time of raging populism and unprecedented income inequality, in the United Kingdom and the United States, why are Americans lapping up a love song from the servants to their masters?\n\nThe Downton Abbey franchise, which originated on Britain\u2019s ITV and aired on PBS\u2019s \u201cMasterpiece\u201d from 2011 to 2016, always took a romantic view of the economic hierarchy. The show, set in 1910s and \u201820s England, flirted with the social turmoil of its time; there were subplots about male primogeniture, class mobility, women in the workforce. But it was mostly a soap opera of manners, filled with untimely deaths, secret babies and forbidden love, wrapped in gilded costumes and an unspoken promise that the servants knew their place.\n\nThe movie, set in 1927, doubles down on that class consciousness. The plot centers on a one-night visit to the estate from King George V and his wife, which leaves the Crawleys a bit frazzled\u2014whatever will they wear?\u2014but the servants thrilled. Mr. Carson, the butler who embodies respect for the Old Order, is even lured out of retirement to make sure the silver is sufficiently polished.\n\nBut then the Buckingham Palace staff arrives at the estate, snooty and sneering and fully intending to bigfoot the locals. And rather than celebrate a rare night off, the proud Downton servants decide to defend their honor. A caper ensues: a little drugging, a little telephone fraud, and soon enough they\u2019ve dispatched the king\u2019s staff\u2014some sent back to London under false pretenses, some locked in their bedrooms in the servants\u2019 quarters\u2014and grabbed the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to serve canapes and wine to Their Majesties.\n\nDear lovers of the aristocracy, there\u2019s more! The one Irish Republican character\u2014a former chauffeur who spent time in the Irish resistance\u2014finds a dramatic way to prove his loyalty to the king. (He also unwittingly convinces the princess to stay in a loveless marriage; \u201cthe crown,\u201d she declares to her parents, is more important than happiness.) Another noblewoman passes off her illegitimate daughter as her maid, a circumstance that seems to bother no one. In the final scene, Downton\u2019s butler and housekeeper walk into the moonlight, hoping out loud that the feudal system carries on forever.\n\nYes, this is a period piece, written by Julian Fellowes, that most period-y of British period writers. (He\u2019s also a conservative member of the House of Lords.) And yet so much of actual 1920s history goes unseen.\n\nAt the time, the British labor movement was gaining traction, notes James Vernon, a professor of modern British history at the University of California-Berkeley. While British newspapers were breathlessly covering the social lives of the aristocracy, some people were pushing for the abolition of hereditary titles and demanding that the nobles\u2019 land be taxed. In 1928, working-class women would get the vote. Within 20 years, the entire system would fall apart\u2014and domestic service would go from being one of Britain\u2019s largest sectors of employment for women to being virtually nonexistent.\n\nFew tears were shed, among the working class, for the end of that era. The happy harmony of Downton is \u201ca complete fantasy,\u201d Vernon says. \u201cIt\u2019s a fantasy based upon the idea that the people who are in domestic service long to be looked after by what we would now call the one percent. And they\u2019re grateful for the living that they are provided by them. And that\u2019s basically the natural social order.\u201d\n\nThe pleasure in upending that order\u2014watching some people rise, and others topple\u2014is usually at the core of American entertainment. Yes, we\u2019re fascinated with the current British royals, but that\u2019s less aspiration than voyeurism. We know they\u2019re essentially paid actors in a reality soap opera; the salary and benefits are great, but the job is terrible.\n\nFor the most part, though, when it comes to watching wealth, we layer aspiration with resentment. On fictional shows like HBO\u2019s Succession, about a family that owns a global media empire, luxury porn goes down with a chaser of self-satisfaction. Those grand summer homes and helicopter rides are symbols of moral decline and corrupted souls. In real life, we lap up the college admissions scandal and the nouveau-riche ostentatiousness of Real Housewives, taking satisfaction when the rich people\u2019s self-serving tackiness catches up with them. And we know that the waitstaff is watching with clear eyes and the power to topple the system from within\u2014like the bartender whose secret \u201c47 percent\u201d video helped to doom Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign.\n\nIn Downton Abbey, there are no such threats; the worst that might happen is that a valet will spill some soup. And that stability can feel like a comfort.\n\nVernon notes that the show premiered in the heart of the global economic turndown. Now, the movie comes out as political turmoil, in the United States and the United Kingdom, reaches fever pitch. \u201cThe world has been turned upside down for many people,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I think Downton Abbey speaks to those of us who long for a quieter, gentler, apparently more stable time.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not just stability that Downton represents, says Priya Satia, a Stanford University history professor who studies modern Britain. There\u2019s also the prospect, however unrealistic, of a kinder set of relationships between rungs of the social order. The servant characters in Downton, like the maid dressing Lady Mary, feel a bond to their masters that isn\u2019t just economic, but emotional. And the aristocrats feel an obligation to their servants\u2019 welfare, and appreciation for even the dressing-and-polishing skills they bring to the table.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re wise enough to know that this is a romantic, very idealized depiction of servant and master relations, but we just find it so attractive,\u201d she says. \"If we\u2019re going to have inequality, can it at least be nice? Can the dignity of every kind of work be acknowledged?\u201d\n\nThis is, it\u2019s true, the difference between Downton-style inequality and the transactional relationships of today\u2019s economy. Gone are the days of benevolent corporate paternalism, a social compact that ranged from pension funds to full-on company towns. Now, pensions are outsourced to 401(k)s; health care costs are passed on to employees; and within the confines of the gig economy, employer-employee relationships don't exist at all.\n\nMaybe, as Satia suggests, we\u2019re longing for a fantasy version of a time when the rich and poor felt interconnected. When someone like Carson, unlucky enough to be born without noble blood, could still be rewarded for his skills and talents with a middle-class life and an identity\u2014a sense, however imagined, that without him, the system falls apart.\n\nIndeed, Carson\u2019s arc throughout the Downton series represents a dignified way to manage upheaval. In the early days, he was often comic relief, flummoxed by new technology. But over time, he became the center of his own small sphere of power\u2014at least someone still knows how the polishing gets done.\n\nIn real life these days, on both sides of the pond, older men are doing their best to upend the system. But Carson has been around long enough to know that this might be the best he\u2019s going to get. He\u2019s made peace with the imperfections of the world, so long as he still gets to pour the wine.\n\nThis article tagged under: Movies\n\nCulture Club", "description": "Is the movie\u2019s popularity rooted in acceptance of economic inequality\u2014and yearning for at least a gentler kind?", "authors": ["John F.
