Johnson had privately told EU diplomats during his time as foreign secretary of his desire to build a \u201cbuccaneering\u201d Britain, which has been seen as an indication of his plan to recast the UK as a low-tax and low-regulation state.\n\nMerkel\u2019s comments indicate the difficulty that the British government will face in striking what it has described as a \u201cbest in class\u201d free trade deal if it fails to match EU standards on goods, workers\u2019 rights, tax and the environment, among others.\n\nEU sources have said that the UK will need to sign up to more onerous, level playing-field obligations than Canada due to the UK\u2019s proximity and the size of its economy.\n\nDiplomats in Brussels said that the British government would be presented with a \u201cCanada minus minus\u201d, potentially including tariffs on some goods, if it seeks to strike a free trade deal without the full array of commitments currently contained in the political declaration on the future relationship agreed with Theresa May.\n\nMerkel told German parliamentarians: \u201cWe still have every chance of getting an orderly [Brexit] and the German government will do everything it can to make that possible \u2013 right up to the last day. But I also say we are prepared for a disorderly Brexit.\n\n\u201cBut the fact remains that after the withdrawal of Britain, we have an economic competitor at our door, even if we want to keep close economic, foreign and security cooperation and friendly relations.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, as Europeans we are weaker with Britain\u2019s exit \u2013 that has to be said \u2013 but on the other hand, this is the moment to develop new strengths.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cNo country in the world can solve its problems alone and if we all work against each other we will not win. I believe in win-win situations, if we work together.\u201d\n\nA UK government spokesman said: \u201cThe UK is seeking to agree a free trade agreement. The EU have always said this is available. Any level playing-field provisions will need to reflect this end state.\u201d\n\nThe intervention from Berlin came as France\u2019s minister for Europe, Am\u00e9lie de Montchalin, accused the UK of breaking \u201cthe spirit\u201d of the negotiations by trying to strike \u201cmini-deals\u201d with individual EU member states.\n\n\u201cWe see that in the bilateral meetings the British try to get with their opposite numbers that they are trying to organise a managed no deal,\u201d she told a news conference after meeting the 26 ambassadors to France of the EU\u2019s members. The British ambassador was excluded. \u201cAnd what the British want is to ensure that the different relationships that they have with each EU member state are recreated before the moment of separation, thanks to these mini deals. It is completely contrary to the spirit in which we\u2019ve been negotiating. When [Stephen] Barclay [the UK Brexit secretary] or others try this in France, we say: \u2018We hear you. Go and talk to Michel Barnier to see what can be done at the European level.\u2019\u201d\n\nDe Montchalin said a no deal was now \u201chighly possible\u201d. She added that a Brexit extension request by the UK would not be accepted under the \u201ccurrent conditions\u201d and the the EU27 would deal with the UK prime minister and not parliament.\n\nChaos is being normalised. It is all part of Boris Johnson\u2019s pernicious plan | Paul Mason Read more\n\nShe said: \u201cWe first have to receive a formal ask. Governments talk to the commission, that\u2019s the way it works. There is no such thing, for example, as parliament asking for an extension. Those who have the legitimacy to represent a country are those who sit at the table of the European council.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf \u2013 and that\u2019s a big if, it seems \u2026 we try to follow what\u2019s happening in the UK \u2013 but if there is such an ask, we have always said that \u2018time for time\u2019 is not an option. So if there is a change in the political scene \u2013 a new government, the announcement of elections, something that makes us think the landscape of the discussions is changing \u2013 then we will consider an extension.\n\n\n\n\u201cI cannot tell you now what might be decided now in such a situation on a night in Brussels in October,\u201d the French minister added. \u201cAs we have said, under current circumstances, the answer is no: if nothing changes, we have always said time alone is not a sufficient reason [for another extension]. We cannot commit today, because we have no concrete scenarios yet.\u201d", "description": "UK poses threat if it fails to match regulation standards of bloc, says German chancellor", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey", "Jon Henley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4cd91f8b586c3ad0bd7ec3f2e4c24dbc6179c3e/0_144_3858_2314/master/3858.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c7e372f4b271ca4af10611c7cd8af4cf", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
