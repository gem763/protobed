The company, which rents flexible office space, made a loss of $1.9bn on revenues of $1.8bn last year.\n\nWeWork was forced to downgrade the proposed price of shares sold in the IPO and was reportedly considering a public valuation as low as $10bn, according to Reuters.\n\nThat would have left many of WeWork\u2019s existing investors facing steep losses in the stock market flotation. The Financial Times reported that SoftBank, WeWork\u2019s biggest investor, had recently urged the company to put off its IPO to avoid the chastening write down.\n\nAdam Neumann, chief executive officer of US co-working firm WeWork.

The company initially had the idea to try and replicate the office perks of a Google or Facebook for smaller companies who needed flexible office space.\n\nWeWork has since grown into one of the biggest office rental companies in the world, with over 528 locations in 29 countries. It now caters to businesses of all sizes and is the biggest office renter in London and New York. It is known for its colourful office interiors and free beer taps provided at each location.\n\nIn recent years, WeWork has sought to position itself more of a lifestyle business rather than just a loss-making office provider. It rebranded as The We Company and launched side-businesses in education, housing, and fitness.\n\nCritics say the loss-making company is being propped up by cheap venture capital funding and does not have a sustainable business model. WeWork rents space in buildings on long leases and then sub-lets them to businesses on shorter leases, leaving the company vulnerable to economic downturns or falling rents.\n\nScott Galloway, a former entrepreneur and professor of marketing at NYU Stern, said in a recently widely shared blog that the $47bn valuation was \u201cinsane\u201d and WeWork would \u201cdissipate at the first whiff of a recession.\u201d", "description": "The office provider said it now hopes to list on the stock exchange 'by the end of the year.'", "authors": ["Oscar Williams-Grut", "Senior City Correspondent", "Yahoo Finance Uk"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/nY4e6Bpe0DRrx26VpAZYWg--~B/aD0yNTM0O3c9MzgwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-04/2a615f00-6ab5-11e9-b875-0f176481ee34", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
