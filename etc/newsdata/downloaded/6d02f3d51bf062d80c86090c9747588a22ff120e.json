Or that Winnipeg's Golden Boy statue once acted as a secret safe haven for queer folks to meet? How about the fact that a set of laws called 'The Indian Act' still exists in Canada? Our country's history may be more complex than you think.\n\nThe Secret Life of Canada is self-described as a podcast that \"highlights the people, places and stories that probably didn't make it into your high school textbook.\" Each episode, hosts Leah-Simone Bowen and Falen Johnson dive right in, holding up a microscope to moments of Canadian history that have been widely overlooked...until now.\n\nLeah and Falen join us this week as guest curators! You can find their picks below.\n\nPodcasts featured this week:\n\nThe Secret Life of Canada \u2013 Leah and Falen tell the story of how the Canadian government used brutal methods to force the relocation of the Inuit well into the 20th century.\n\nThe Hilarious World of Depression \u2013 Maria Bamford speaks candidly about her mental illness and how laughing about it helps her cope.\n\nMogul \u2013 Once he made his way into the music industry, Chris Lighty's career took off fast. And it meant he had to make some hard choices about old friendships along the way.\n\nAll My Relations \u2013 Matika and Adrienne discuss their complicated relationship with feminism and why as Indigenous women, identifying as feminists is more difficult than it might seem.\n\nWho? Weekly \u2013 Tati Westbrook and James Charles are big time beauty YouTubers (or \"Beau-Tubers\"), and they used to be close \u2014 until James did something Tati couldn't forgive. In this clip from Who Weekly, Bobby and Lindsey explain all the ins and outs of the drama you absolutely do not need to know about.\n\nPLUS:\n\nThe Secret Life of Canada is now also available in your classroom!\n\nPodcasts in Class is a way for teachers to bring podcasts into their classrooms, with custom-made lesson plans, slides, handouts, homework and even videos featuring the hosts.
