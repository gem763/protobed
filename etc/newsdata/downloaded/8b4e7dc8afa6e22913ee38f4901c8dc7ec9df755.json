That familiar electric gruffness has been replaced with something kindlier and more considered. Getting used to it is a bit like watching John McEnroe play tennis on the seniors\u2019 circuit \u2013 you wait for a moment that suggests the old unique timing, and it\u2019s all the more poignant when you catch the sudden ghost of it.\n\nWe met in a hotel bar on one of those baking days of summer. Connolly was over in the UK to finish the voiceovers of his latest eccentric tour of America for ITV. His wife, Pamela Stephenson, accompanied him into the coolness of the bar, settled him in a corner chair and then left us to it. All day before we met I\u2019d been immersed in his new book, which collects in print the wild and whirling tales that have been Connolly\u2019s stage show for the past four decades \u2013 those riffs on inflight toilets, Mairi\u2019s Wedding, incontinence knickers, the Last Supper. His collected stories. He\u2019s resisted ever writing them down, but the fact that he recently announced retirement from the stage made it seem like the right moment. Still, he says, he can\u2019t quite bear to look at his own words on the page.\n\nIf it\u2019s any consolation, I say, it reads like a talking book.\n\n\u201cI hope so,\u201d he concedes. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, I tried to write stuff down over the years, but I never could. I\u2019d end up just with things that are good on chat shows, one-liners but no stories. I even tried to write a book once. It ended up two pages long. I couldn\u2019t think of anything else to say.\u201d\n\nOn Twitter, guys I\u2019d never set eyes on were threatening to beat the shit out of me. I thought: fuck this. It\u2019s anti-social media\u2019\n\nHe pauses for a moment, structuring the next thought. \u201cMind you,\u201d he says, \u201cone of the best stories I ever read had two pages. This was 50 years ago. Someone in the story had invented a way of linking up all the computers in the world and it promised to collect all knowledge and make life amazing for everybody. It fell to the president to launch it. He typed in the question \u2018Is there a God?\u2019 A few seconds went by and the answer came on the screen: \u2018Now there is\u2019.\u201d He pauses again. \u201cAnd here we are,\u201d he says.\n\nConnolly was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease six years ago, just as he reached his three score years and 10. He got the news on the same day that he was diagnosed with prostate cancer (\u201cYou\u2019re not going to die,\u201d the doctor told him. \u201cOf course I\u2019m not going to fucking die,\u201d Connolly replied. \u201cThe thought has never crossed my mind\u201d). A timely operation solved the cancer. The Parkinson\u2019s obviously hasn\u2019t gone away. At the beginning of this year he made a film about living with the condition, in which he inadvertently seemed to be saying goodbye. He subsequently had to reassure fans by putting out a short film of himself crooning with his banjo on the deck of his Florida home: \u201cNot dying, not dead, not slipping away.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 0:22 'Not dying, not dead' : Sir Billy Connolly sends reassuring musical message to fans \u2013 video\n\nI say to him it is good to see that reports of his demise were exaggerated. He looks well.\n\n\u201cI have good days and bad days,\u201d he says. \u201cShaky days. I made an arse of it on the film I made, where I said I was wasting away. But Parkinson\u2019s is like that. One day my hearing went, then my balance went, my sight got worse. It feels as if everything is being taken away from you and you watch it go. But I am on medication, so it is all going slowly.\u201d\n\nIn his book, he suggests that ever-present sense of decline tends to make you pay more attention to life. Is that so?\n\n\u201cLittle changes quickly become normal,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t get out of bed, so I put my hands up like this\u201d \u2013he raises his arms \u2013 \u201cwhen I want to get up and Pam pulls me to the side of the bed. I can\u2019t get my legs over.\u201d He smiles. \u201cYour priorities change. When I walk into a room now I am scanning to see which chair I might be able to get out of. But it\u2019s not terrible.\u201d He had a doctor who told him: \u201cYou have to understand this is an incurable disease.\u201d Connolly corrected him abruptly. \u201cYou mean, this is a disease for which we have yet to find a cure.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive me a light in the tunnel for Christ\u2019s sake!\u201d he says. \u201cThey are making extraordinary advances. Probably not soon enough for me. But for the next generation, maybe.\u201d\n\nHow easy is it to retain a sense that life is comedy rather than tragedy?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A mural of Connolly by Scottish artist Jack Vettriano in Dixon Street, Glasgow, one of three unveiled around the city in 2017 in honour of his 75th birthday. Photograph: Gerard Ferry/Alamy Stock Photo\n\n\u201cIt is important to hold on to that,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be that guy in the corner with what they call Parkinson\u2019s face, looking bewildered. One symptom is a tendency to look forwards, to not look people in the eye.\u201d He catches himself. \u201cI\u2019m doing it now. I have to correct it. I have a doctor in New York, Jewish and funny, she really likes me to joke about it. The constipation, all that.\u201d He mock-grimaces. \u201cSome doctors don\u2019t, they want you to take it all seriously. But I think, WFN. Why fucking not?\u201d\n\nIs he a model patient?\n\n\u201cI fear I become a pain in the arse at times. Pamela has to sort my pillows out when I get into bed. She didn\u2019t do it right last night. And you lie there thinking: \u2018Can I really ask her to come back and do it again? Or should I put up with it?\u2019 So far, she has never tutted. And she\u2019s a rather attractive nurse.\u201d\n\nIt was Stephenson who organised the move to Florida last year. They had been living in New York, but Connolly told her that his uncertain balance couldn\u2019t take another winter of snow and slippery sidewalks. Before he knew it she had found and bought the house in Key West. \u201cAnd so I went,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like in my life now, she does things and I follow.\u201d\n\nHe has appreciated the move. They have a river that runs by their back door and he can fish off the deck, almost without getting out of bed.\n\n\u201cManatee come up and I give them water and lettuce,\u201d he says. \u201cThese big strange things like mermaids. We have pelicans and turkey buzzards; pterodactyls wouldn\u2019t be a surprise. People drive down to Key West for the sunset and cheer when it disappears over the horizon. Pamela and I don\u2019t cheer, but we watch it.\u201d\n\nThere is an alligator catcher, a good man to know. When he catches one he brings it to Connolly\u2019s house first to show him. \u201cHis technique is to tie up its jaws and keep it in his garden, where he plays AC/DC to it night and day,\u201d he says. \u201cMotorhead would do just as well \u2013 No Sleep \u2019til Hammersmith. In his experience the alligators just stay away from humans after that.\u201d\n\nDoes he feel at home at that end of the earth?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good place to live. There are a lot of people running away from regular society: cross-gender people; guys who just fish or lie on the sidewalk. There is a naked bar not far from us, I\u2019ve never been, though Pam has; I told her to choose her bar stool carefully. They are big on parades. Every Tuesday is Tutu Tuesday. It is a surreal kind of place. I like it.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest With Pamela Stephenson, 1985. Photograph: Steve Fenton/Shutterstock\n\nI have met and interviewed Connolly once before, nearly 20 years ago. At the time he was, at Stephenson\u2019s insistence, facing up to the demons of his Glasgow childhood, what he smiled at calling his \u201cabandonment issues\u201d, enjoying the grandeur of the phrase. He had been having a lot of therapy, not least from his comedian-turned-shrink wife. She had written a book about him, with him, in which he revealed all sorts of darkness. How his mother had literally walked out on him and his sister when they were toddlers and they were apparently by themselves for some days before being discovered and reluctantly taken in by aunts. How his father, not long home from the war, often drunk, had \u201cinterfered with him\u201d, abused him over a period of years, experiences that had, he had come to understand, fuelled his own alcoholism. At the time we spoke, he had long been sober but seemed quite high on Californian introspection. Watching him on TV in recent years, I suggest he seems to have parked that phase, moved on from it.\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d he says. \u201cI have got rid of it all. The thing therapy can teach you is you have to employ forgiveness in life. After my father\u2019s death, I thought all the bad stuff would go away, but actually it all came rushing back and dominated my thoughts. And I realised I had to take it all on directly.\u201d\n\nStephenson \u2013 with whom he has three daughters, as well as a son and daughter from his first marriage \u2013 was obviously a gift in that regard: a blast of up-front Aussie courage to uncover all that was buried under layers of tight-lipped Scottishness and maleness and old-school Clydeside welder\u2019s banter. She also insisted Connolly had to move forward. \u201cThat kind of past is like a big rucksack full of bricks,\u201d he says now. \u201cYou can lug it around all your life if you like. Or you can find a way to put it down and walk away.\u201d\n\nHe refused to see himself as a victim. \u201cI see people on daytime talk shows, and there is a line underneath saying how sexual abuse or whatever has ruined their life. I think it\u2019s a crime to say that of someone. It makes them a victim of something they are totally innocent of. I don\u2019t dwell on any of that in my past now. I don\u2019t do therapy any more, because I don\u2019t feel I need it.\u201d\n\nPart of the way out of for him was Buddhist meditation. I remember him joking to me the last time we met about how he had recently experienced the ultimate Hollywood moment: Shirley MacLaine had come up to him at a party to whisper how \u201ccentred\u201d he looked. Has he kept his practice up?\n\n\u201cAye,\u201d he says, with a beatific smile. \u201cThe mindfulness of breathing. I do it every morning, just to get me squared up.\u201d He catches some of the old Govan cadence. \u201cIt is dead easy. You just breathe and make yourself aware of breathing.\u201d He likes the fact it is called \u201cJust Sitting\u201d. \u201cLoosen your trousers, untie your shoes and just sit with your eyes closed for 10 minutes or so. Open the window a wee bit, so you can hear a few noises.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Connolly with Kenny Everett and Freddie Mercury at the latter\u2019s 38th birthday party, Xenon nightclub, 1984. Photograph: Dave Hogan/Getty Images\n\nDoes it help him with the Parkinson\u2019s?\n\n\u201cIt does. Mostly it helps you to not be afraid of yourself. Quiets the voices in your head. And I have plenty of them. Good ones and bad ones, just like everyone else.\u201d\n\nWhat was the happiest time of his life? I wonder.\n\n\u201cIt is all just about now. But getting famous was good. It was like going up a helter-skelter backwards. You know, the first time I had a sell-out at the London Palladium? That\u2019s very exciting. Particularly when you are on your own out there, I think, and it is your own material. You have created this thing and people like it. That was a lovely thing. But being famous gets wearing, though you learn to live with it.\u201d\n\nHe is famous in America as much for his film acting as his comedy. I wonder when was the last time he walked into a room and no one recognised him?\n\n\u201cA long time ago. But it\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\nI mention something I remember Tom Waits saying to me on this subject once, in an interview, how \u201cthe odd thing about this life is that you spend half your time trying to get people to listen to you and the rest of the time trying to get them to leave you the fuck alone\u2026\u201d\n\nHe laughs. \u201cTom came to see me a few times in San Francisco,\u201d he says, \u201cand he brought his sons along to a show. He called me afterwards to say that he\u2019d had to pull the car over on the way home, and tell his boys that they shouldn\u2019t say \u2018cunt\u2019 in front of their mother when they got home.\u201d He adopts a guttural Waits voice: \u201c\u2018Just because Billy Connolly said it, that doesn\u2019t make it right.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt would be fair to say he has never tired of the joys of invective. \u201cI have two grandchildren, 18 and 13 now,\u201d he says. \u201cI used to love it when they were wee and had exercises at school and you\u2019d to talk about your granddad. Wally wrote \u2018My granddad has a purple beard and he plays the banjo and he squares [sic] all the time and he also has a big knife \u2013 a dirk \u2013 which he lets me play with.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen he talks about his family the wattage of his attention brightens. \u201cMy eldest daughter makes films. She won a prize at Sundance recently. My son Jamie is nearly 50. He and I fish together. He\u2019s brilliant, better than me.\u201d\n\nIn his book he writes movingly about how all fathers should go fishing with their sons; unlike with football there is not much action to fill the silence. \u201cYou have to talk, you are away for hours, days. And you have to talk to each other. About real things.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Connolly at the height of his standup fame in the 1980s. Photograph: Photoshot/Getty Images\n\nHaving not had much example of that himself he has been determined to be better at it. The kids are scattered all over now, New York, Glasgow, Los Angeles. There is a family rule to Whatsapp each other pictures of dinner if they are in a restaurant. \u201cThere is no Indian restaurant in Key West,\u201d Connolly says, \u201cso they will send me pictures of curries: \u2018Eat your heart out\u2019.\u201d\n\nBeyond those pictures Connolly\u2019s relationship with social media is \u201cdeliberately sparse\u201d. He has a phone and he can do email. He doesn\u2019t know what Facebook does. He went on Twitter once when he was doing a play with Eric Idle and they were invited to create accounts to promote it. It was like the whole world turned into the Scottish tabloid press.\n\n\u201cStraight away, people just started attacking me, challenging me to a fight. Guys I\u2019d never set eyes on saying they would beat the shit out of me. I thought \u2018Fuck this\u2019. It was like being in jail.\u201d He erased it sharpish. \u201cIt\u2019s anti-social media,\u201d he says.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t see that many \u201cshow business\u201d friends these days, he says, though if singers and songwriters he likes \u2013 John Sebastian, Arlo Guthrie \u2013 are in Florida he will make an effort to go. When he watches people up on stage does he still have a yearning to be up there too, in his element?\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t miss it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was great, but life without it is just dandy. Jamie and I were away fishing in Utah a couple of weeks ago. The Green River. We got to know all the guides, and we\u2019d go for dinner with them. A couple of times, I just sort of took over and told funny stories, and it felt great, and they were all roaring with laughter, Jamie too. It was a lovely feeling. Just letting it roll like that again. But no, I don\u2019t miss touring.\u201d\n\nHe doesn\u2019t watch much comedy, he says. He always feared he would subconsciously steal stuff and old habits die hard. His heroes are musicians not funny men. \u201cHank Williams and Bob Dylan are the two,\u201d he says. He has met Dylan a few times, \u201cthough each time I have to be reintroduced to him, then we are like best buddies by the end of the evening.\u201d It was when he heard Dylan say he loved Hank Williams, too, that he knew that \u201cthere was a God\u201d. Connolly, of course, started out as a singer and banjo player in folk clubs, and \u201cfolkies always wanted to look down on country and western music \u2013 but not me.\u201d\n\nDoes he remember the first time he heard Hank Williams?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Connolly with Gerry Rafferty, his partner in the folk duo the Humblebums, in 1967. Photograph: Brian Shuel/Redferns\n\nHe thinks and a smile spreads across his face. \u201cI do,\u201d he says. \u201cMy father had bought a record called Dear Mary, by Slim Whitman, at the Barrowland market in Glasgow. He thought it was a hymn, I think, but it was a country song,\u201d He sings a couple of bars in a mournful falsetto: \u201cI am writing this letter Dear Mary\u2026\u201d \u201cI loved it and my dad went back to the market and asked if they had anything else like that. The guy gave him Hank Williams, Long Gone Lonesome Blues. That was the start.\u201d\n\nOne of the highlights of his latest TV travels in America was to pitch up in Alabama and hold Hank Williams\u2019s guitar. He laughs. \u201cI sat there with this wonderful thing, and everyone watching, and of course my mind went blank and I couldn\u2019t think of a single fucking Hank Williams song.\u201d\n\nThe theme of that series was going to be Scots in America, \u201ctalking to witches and so on\u201d but it didn\u2019t quite work out like that. I wonder if he had planned to do anything on President Trump\u2019s mother, that bouffant \u00e9migr\u00e9 from the Isle of Lewis.\n\n\u201cNo, we kept away from all that madness,\u201d he says, stiffening. \u201cTalk about Trump, though, look who you\u2019ve got now over here: fucking soft boy.\u201d It\u2019s a relief to be a few thousand miles away from Brexit, he says. \u201cWhat a con, and the prime minister was the biggest con of all. I saw on American TV people being interviewed in south Wales, and how pleased they were to have voted out of Europe. And then they showed all the things that the EU had funded in their town. They had no idea. It\u2019s completely nuts.\u201d\n\nConnolly has a foot in Europe with a house on the island of Gozo, off Malta, which he bought after his manager, Steve Brown, moved there. Brown died in 2017. He still goes when he can. \u201cWe have an old school house. They are lovely people. There are a few Brits there too, mostly moaning about how Britain is full of immigrants\u2026\u201d\n\nHe himself has lived away from Scotland, in the States, for a long time now. Is he the kind of expat who needs to have bits of home with him?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s OK,\u201d he says. \u201cThe local supermarket has Irn Bru and Tunnock\u2019s caramel wafers.\u201d He is going up to Glasgow after our interview. \u201cI mostly look forward to the curry these days,\u201d he says, \u201cMother India on Sauchiehall Street. You get a lot of Mexican food in Florida, which always seems to be more about folding than eating.\u201d\n\nNow this book is out, I ask if he has any plans to write a proper memoir.\n\nHe admits to \u201cticking the idea\u201d but that \u201cthere\u2019s plenty of other things to do. I\u2019d like to write songs again. I like to draw.\u201d He pauses, and seems a bit weary suddenly. \u201cLife is a bowl of cherries,\u201d he says.\n\nDoes he have gloomy moments?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018When the sun goes down each night, I\u2019m pretty content.\u2019 Photograph: Amit Lennon/The Observer\n\n\u201cI do. I sometimes try to visualise what is going to happen to me and then I have to work hard at coming out of it.\u201d\n\nWhat is the best strategy for that?\n\n\u201cIt usually ends up with me saying: \u2018Billy, you are 76 years old, how the fuck did you imagine you were going to feel?\u2019\u201d\n\nHe thinks again about the question I asked earlier, about happiness. \u201cPeople think you have to be happy, you know the sun shining and the beach ball and \u2018ha ha ha\u2019, but I\u2019ve never been like that. If you change the word happy to content, that\u2019s more what I\u2019m after. When the sun goes down each night, I\u2019m pretty content,\u201d he says, and pauses. \u201cMind you I sleep like a wild animal these days. Laughing and singing, or having fights. Pamela has to sleep in another bed.\u201d\n\nHe thinks those disturbed nights are probably to do with the Parkinson\u2019s or the medication. But he seems to me for the most part, I say, to be going on pretty well.\n\n\u201cI am, and then I\u2019m not. A shudder comes over me and I can\u2019t get my money back in my wallet or whatever.\u201d The compensation, he says, is that it brings out the best in people he meets. \u201cIf you say \u2018I can\u2019t get up, could you help me out of my chair please?\u2019 no one ever says \u2018Why?\u2019 They just do it. Maybe it\u2019s just me but I live in this magical life.\u201d\n\nI suggest that he has worked pretty hard for that over the years.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about that,\u201d he says, and pauses a final time. \u201cI walk down the street and people shout: \u2018Hey Billy, how\u2019s it going?\u2019 It\u2019s great,\u201d he says. \u201cI always get the best of people: when they walk toward me they are already smiling.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Tall Tales and Wee Stories is published by John Murray Press (\u00a320).
