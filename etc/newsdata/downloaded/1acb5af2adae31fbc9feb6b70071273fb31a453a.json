On Sunday morning, Trump sought to cast Baghdadi\u2019s death \u2014 and his role \u2014 in historic terms. And he seemed to receive the bipartisan praise he covets at a time when it has proved hard to come by. Vehement Trump critics such as Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) lauded the death, even as they warned that the president\u2019s decision to pull U.S. troops from Syria could spark a revival of the Islamic State.\n\nAD\n\nSunday\u2019s announcement began, as they often do in the Trump presidency, with an ominous tweet. \u201cSomething very big has just happened!\u201d the president said Saturday night, as if he were sharing a \u201csweeps week\u201d-like promo for a TV show.\n\nHe said nothing else. On Sunday, Trump explained that he posted late Saturday so journalists would not be golfing, playing tennis or \u201cindisposed\u201d for his announcement.\n\nAD\n\nHe also said he waited for troops to land in a safe zone before tweeting.\n\nTrump strode to the podium in the Diplomatic Room alone around 9:20 a.m. Sunday morning, wearing a red tie.\n\nAs a retinue of top aides \u2014 sans acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney \u2014 stood nearby, along with Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), Trump described the raid in surprisingly precise, if unverified, terms.\n\nThe leader of the Islamic State, Trump said, died surrounded by American forces in an Idlib tunnel Saturday night, detonating a suicide vest as American forces and dogs circled. The president also said Baghdadi had taken three small children with him into the \u201cdead-end\u201d tunnel, effectively leading them to their deaths.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe president seemed to take particular joy in recounting gruesome, gory details, citing the Islamic State beheadings of Americans in orange jumpsuits and a need to convince others to not join forces.\n\nThe president said Baghdadi\u2019s body had been mutilated beyond recognition and that it took a sophisticated test to prove it was him. He called Baghdadi\u2019s followers \u201closers\u201d and \u201cfrightened puppies.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe died after running into a dead-end tunnel, whimpering, screaming and crying all the way,\u201d Trump said. Later, he said it again. \u201cHe died like a dog, he died like a coward, he was whimpering, screaming and crying,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd frankly, I think it\u2019s something that should be brought out.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe president said he watched from the Situation Room with military officials after playing golf with Graham, Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) and Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred. An aide later posted a picture that showed him, scowling at the head of the table, with military officials and the vice president looking on.\n\nAD\n\nAt the news conference, Trump boasted of the quality of the footage. \u201cLike you were watching a movie,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president demurred when asked whether he could hear the whimpering from his video hookup, a relevant question because Trump has often described people as crying who said they were not. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nLater, Secretary of Defense Mark T. Esper was asked whether he, too, could hear \u201cwhimpering and crying\u201d during the raid.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have those details,\u201d he said. \u201cThe president probably had the opportunity to talk to the commanders on the ground.\u201d\n\nThe president also described a 70-minute military flight during which eight helicopters faced incoming fire from \u201crandom people who don\u2019t like helicopters,\u201d the capture of \u201chighly sensitive\u201d information from the leader\u2019s compound, and a detailed description of the raid itself.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a normal person, you say knock knock, can I come in,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThat\u2019s not how the Army Delta forces handled Baghdadi, Trump said. Instead, he described in detail how the troops blew the walls out. Before you knew it, he said, there was a \u201cbig beautiful hole\u201d where the compound had been.\n\nAD\n\nIt was all described in historic terms because there had never been anything like it, the president said, a familiar dynamic for how he has cast his presidency.\n\n\u201cBin Laden was a big thing, but this is the biggest there is,\u201d Trump said. He bemoaned that the military under his tenure had previously not killed \u201cthe big names.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere were names I\u2019d never heard of, they were names that weren\u2019t recognizable, and they weren\u2019t the big names. Some good ones, some important ones, but they weren\u2019t the big names. I kept saying, where\u2019s al-Baghdadi?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump asserted that bin Laden was not as important because he\u2019d become well-known only after the World Trade Center attacks \u2014 and that his predecessors should have done something about him before.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNobody ever heard of Osama bin Laden before the World Trade Center,\u201d Trump said. \u201cOsama bin Laden was big, but Osama bin Laden became big with the World Trade Center. This is a man who built a whole, as he would like to call it, a country,\u201d he said of the Islamic State leader.\n\nAt the news conference, Trump falsely claimed that he predicted a terrorist attack from bin Laden in \u201cThe America We Deserve.\u201d In the book, Trump vaguely mentions the possibility of a terrorist threat and bin Laden but says nothing specific.\n\n\u201cIf you read my book, there\u2019s a book just before the World Trade Center came down, and I don\u2019t get any credit for this, but that\u2019s okay, I never do. But here we are. A very, very successful book,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they would have listened to me, a lot things would have been different.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe added: \u201cI wrote 12 books, all did very well.\u201d\n\nThe president revealed he did not tell House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) about the Syrian operation, eschewing typical procedure ahead of major military activities, because he was afraid she would leak details, leading to endangered troops, while adding that he told the Russians \u201cwe\u2019re coming in.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn't do that. I wanted to make sure this kept secret. I don\u2019t want to have men lost and women. I don\u2019t want to have people lost,\u201d Trump said, without offering any evidence that Pelosi would have endangered lives.\n\nGraham and Vice President Pence later dodged questions about the topic.\n\nAt one point, Trump criticized an unnamed journalist he\u2019d seen on TV for not giving him credit for winning the travel ban case at the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cYour network is doing a great job,\u201d he said to a different reporter, from One America News Network, a right-wing channel that has actively sought his approval and has won it during his occasional bouts with Fox News.\n\nAD\n\nHe boasted of his own prowess on the Internet while favorably comparing himself to the Islamic State leaders and their sophisticated recruitment efforts. \u201cThey use the Internet better than almost anybody in the world, perhaps other than Donald Trump,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThere was mixed messaging about dogs. While he likened Baghdadi\u2019s \u201cbrutal\u201d death to that of a \u201cdog,\u201d he also lamented there was a military canine hurt in the operation. \u201cOur canine, I call it a dog, a beautiful dog, a talented dog, was injured and brought back,\u201d he said.\n\nHe described Osama bin Laden and his son as \u201cvery handsome\u201d and \u201ccharismatic\u201d before attacking their actions.\n\nHe lavished praise on Russia for sharing intelligence and letting the United States fly through its airspace but criticized Europe for being a \u201cdisappointment\u201d in not taking Islamic State terrorists. Of all the countries that received Trump\u2019s praise, Russia was at the top of the list in the president\u2019s remarks.\n\nThe president also took a jab at some in the intelligence community, while praising those involved in the effort, saying he had dealt with \u201cpeople who aren\u2019t very intelligent having to do with intel.\u201d\n\nBefore he concluded the news conference, he went back to the violence of Baghdadi.\n\n\u201cHe was a gutless animal,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThank you all very much. I appreciate it.\u201d", "description": "Over 45 minutes, Trump offered a surprising, unfiltered and unverified account of the military operation.", "authors": ["Josh Dawsey", "Reporter Covering The White House"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/XeEKJWCSC71__hQOoiw9kgwgIfs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WVK5FYHY2AI6TAMQNPSN5NLOAE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
