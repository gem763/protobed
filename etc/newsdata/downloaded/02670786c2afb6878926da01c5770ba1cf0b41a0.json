We have constantly rejected this and believed that the matter of Dasnois decision on the night of December 5 had to be ventilated an open court\".\n\nThe paper also claimed that, because Dasnois \"falsely\" sought to depict her claim as a case about press freedom and editorial prerogative, this made it \"even more important [for INMSA] to [try] the matter in court\".\n\nWhyte said the Cape Times, however, pointed out that the case was indeed (inexplicably) settled by an agreement.\n\n\"INMSA was obviously a party to that agreement, but the reader is left to somehow conclude that INMSA \u2013 although insistent that this case would never be settled by INMSA out of court as our client has no valid case \u2013 somehow inexplicably agreed to settle this case in the face of an invented claim brought by an undeserving gold-digger,\" he said.\n\nHowever, following the settlement, they slammed her decision again.\n\n\"After informing a court that they agreed to end the dispute with Dasnois they immediately recanted with a view to painting a picture of themselves as being vigorously opposed to any settlement and then being 'vindicated' in court -\u00ad when no such thing had happened,\" said Whyte.\n\n\"The code for members of the Press Council provides that allowing commercial, political, personal or other non-\u00adprofessional considerations to influence or slant reporting constitutes serious misconduct on the part of a news group and our client will be lodging a complaint with the Press Ombudsman.\"", "description": "Former Cape Times editor Alide Dasnois intends to lodge a complaint with the Press Ombudsman following two articles published about the settlement of the case between herself and Independent Newspapers, her lawyers say.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/3953/b536f48fbe004de1aa1b27ee5021506a.jpg", "published_at": "2016-05-11"}
