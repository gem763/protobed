REUTERS/Michael Dalder/Files\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Shares in Wirecard (WDIG.DE) sank more than 20% in early trading on Tuesday after the Financial Times newspaper published documents on the company\u2019s accounting practices alleging an effort to inflate sales and profits, dealers said.\n\nAt 0806 GMT, shares were down 15% after hitting their lowest since April 24, making them the biggest faller on Germany's DAX 30 .GDAXI and on track for their worst day since early February.\n\nA Wirecard spokesman declined to comment on the report.\n\nThe newspaper said the documents included internal company spreadsheets and related correspondence between senior members of Wirecard\u2019s finance team, which appear to indicate an effort to inflate sales and profits at its businesses in Dubai and Ireland, as well as to potentially mislead EY, its tier-one auditor.\n\nThe report comes after the paper published a series of stories earlier this year alleging fraud and false accounting at Wirecard\u2019s Singapore office and that a key Middle East unit was not properly audited.\n\nThe company has denied the FT\u2019s allegations, saying that although Dubai-based subsidiary Card Systems was not individually audited, its books had undergone higher-level \u201cfull-scope\u201d scrutiny by auditor EY.", "description": "Shares in Wirecard sank more than 20% in early trading on Tuesday after the Financial Times newspaper published documents on the company's accounting practices alleging an effort to inflate sales and profits, dealers said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441033645&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E0HQ", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
