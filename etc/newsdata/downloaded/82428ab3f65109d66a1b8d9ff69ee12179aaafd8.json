In so doing, we will retain a fiscal anchor to public spending so that decisions are taken with a view to the long-term sustainability of the public finances.\"\n\nA doubling in the annual budget deficit, leading in relation to the size of the economy, the highest government debt since the 1960s.\n\nThese are the new forecasts of the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies for how a no-deal Brexit is likely to drench the UK's public finances in red ink. Only on the extraordinary scale of the fiscal collapse of the 2008 financial crisis are these numbers modest.\n\nOn any ordinary scale they do matter - an annual deficit heading back up towards \u00a3100bn, and national debt closer to 90% of GDP for the first time in half a century.\n\nAnd all this comes at a time where the institute concludes that the government is no longer taking its own fiscal rules seriously, borrowing more to spend more on public services even as the Treasury approaches its self-imposed limits.\n\nRead more here.\n\nIn the case of a no-deal Brexit, the IFS said a temporary government spending spree could help to smooth the path for growth.\n\nHowever, even with \"substantial\" government spending, it said it expects the UK economy to flatline for two years following no-deal.\n\nIt warned that a rise in public spending in 2020 would likely be followed by \"another bust\" as the government would have to deal with \"the consequences of a smaller economy and higher debt for funding public services\".\n\nMr Johnson said that it would be \"crucial\" that government spending programmes were temporary.\n\n\"An economy that turns out smaller than expected can, in the long run, support less public spending than expected, not more,\" he said.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics\n\nChristian Schulz, the chief UK economist at Citi, which contributed to the report, said the country's economy has already shrunk by around \u00a360bn since the EU referendum in 2016.\n\n\"Business investment is up to 20% lower than it would otherwise have been, hurting productivity and wage growth,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Mr Schulz added that a further Brexit delay would create more uncertainty, denting investment and leaving growth at around 1% a year.\n\n\"From a growth perspective, a Brexit deal is a little better, leaving growth at 1.5%, but it would leave no chance of Brexit being cancelled,\" he said.\n\n\"A no-deal Brexit - even with a substantial stimulus - could mean no growth at all for the next two years. Remaining in the EU would be the best scenario for economic growth in the next few years.\"", "description": "Government borrowing would reach its highest level in over half a century, a think tank warns.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07qdckl.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
