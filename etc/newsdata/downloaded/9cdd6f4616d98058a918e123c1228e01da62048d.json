He was responding to comments Biden made over the weekend on CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d in which the Democrat charged it was \u201cimproper\u201d for Trump to appoint his son-in-law and daughter to senior positions in his administration.\n\nMORE QUESTIONS EMERGE ABOUT HUNTER BIDEN'S BUSINESS DEALINGS, EVEN AS TRUMP IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY INTENSIFIES\n\n\u201cA lot of the work that the president\u2019s had me doing over the last three years has actually been cleaning up the messes that Vice President Biden has left behind,\u201d Kushner told News Israel 13. \u201cI think President Trump is entitled to pick his team. We\u2019ve worked with him for a long time and I think we\u2019ve done a good job at trying to help him be successful.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think President Trump is entitled to pick his team. We\u2019ve worked with him for a long time and I think we\u2019ve done a good job at trying to help him be successful.\u201d \u2014 Jared Kushner\n\nKushner also addressed the House Democrats' ongoing Trump impeachment inquiry, which has shed light on Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, who reportedly used his father\u2019s name to gain a seven-figure job at one of Ukraine\u2019s largest natural gas companies despite having no prior related worked experience. Hunter Biden worked for the company, Burisma Holdings, at the same time his father, while vice president, was seeking the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was investigating a top Burisma official.\n\nThe impeachment probe stems from a whistleblower\u2019s complaint that President Trump, during a July phone call, asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Biden family\u2019s business dealings in the country. Trump made the request while the U.S. was withholding military aid but maintains there was no quid quo pro.\n\nKushner insisted that the president was clear of wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been trying to impeach the president for the past three years or get him out of office and they\u2019ve been unsuccessful at that,\u201d Kushner said. \u201cThe best thing going for the president is that he hasn\u2019t done anything wrong, and at this point, they\u2019ve investigated him over and over and over again, and I think the American people are sick and tired of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe best thing going for the president is that he hasn\u2019t done anything wrong, and at this point, they\u2019ve investigated him over and over and over again, and I think the American people are sick and tired of it.\u201d \u2014 Jared Kushner\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s record of accomplishments is unimpeachable, and he\u2019s going to continue to do the things that the American people care about,\u201d Kushner continued. \u201cIf Congress wants to be a part of the work we do to try to make the country stronger and more prosperous, we welcome them to join us. If they want to play silly games, we\u2019ll obviously deal with that in an appropriate manner, but we\u2019re not going to let that distract us as an administration.\u201d\n\nKushner, who is Jewish, traveled to Israel on Monday where he met separately with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former military chief Benny Gantz. The two rivals were deadlocked following last month's Israeli elections, with neither able to easily form a majority coalition, raising the possibility of an unprecedented third election in less than a year. Kushner urged Gantz and Netanyahu to form a government so Israel would be able to seize on the \u201ctremendous opportunities\u201d in the region, including military and business partnerships with Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern nations.\n\n\u201cBenny was a great general in the IDF [Israeli Defense Forces] and he did a great job there and served Israel tremendously, and he seems to have a good intention to try and bring good to Israel, and hopefully he will be able to work with Prime Minister Netanyahu and find a way to move forward,\" Kushner told News Israel 13.\n\nHe also responded to Israeli concerns after President Trump made the call to pull U.S. troops out of Syria, a decision some critics said left the Kurds, who are American allies, vulnerable to Turkey and other forces.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\u201cAnyone in Israel who thinks it has any implications for the U.S.-Israel relationship is badly mistaken,\u201d Kushner said, \u201cbecause under President Trump, the bond between America and Israel has been significantly strengthened and our intention is to continue to do more of the same.\u201d\n\nFox News' Brooke Singman, Brie Stimson and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Jared Kushner,\u00a0a senior adviser to President Trump, said Tuesday that most of his White House work involves \"cleaning up the messes\" left behind by former Vice President Joe Biden.", "authors": ["Danielle Wallace", "Jared Kushner"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/06/ContentBroker_contentid-71b377dd215d45789aa86a532a671b05.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
