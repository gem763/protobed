REUTERS/Andrew Kelly\n\nGovernor Andrew Cuomo on Sunday called for an urgent meeting of the state\u2019s Public Health and Health Planning Council to consider the proposed ban.\n\nThe panel on Tuesday voted to adopt the prohibition, which applies to all flavored e-cigarettes besides menthol, Cuomo\u2019s office said in a statement.\n\nThe state Department of Health pledged to provide retailers with a two-week grace period before conducting site visits to enforce the ban starting on Oct. 7.\n\nNew York is the second state in the nation to introduce such a ban, after Michigan did so earlier this month.\n\n\u201cIt is undeniable that vaping companies are deliberately using flavors like bubblegum, Captain Crunch and cotton candy to get young people hooked on e-cigarettes - it\u2019s a public health crisis and it ends today,\u201d Cuomo said in a statement.\n\nThe share of high school students using e-cigarettes has more than doubled over the past two years, with 27.5% reporting they had used an e-cigarette in the past month, according to preliminary federal data released last week.\n\nLast week, the Trump administration announced plans to remove all flavored e-cigarettes from store shelves.\n\nTHC BLAMED\n\nNearly 400 people around the country have been stricken with a lung illness that is potentially vaping-related, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Six have died.\n\nInvestigators have said they are trying to understand what causes the illnesses.\n\nMichael Frennier, president of the New York State Vapor Association, criticized the New York ban, saying the recent spike in deadly lung illnesses was tied to illicit vaping of the marijuana component THC, not use of flavored nicotine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like having a mayonnaise outbreak of E.coli and the politicians come forth and they say \u2018We\u2019re going to fix this to protect the people of our state and we\u2019re going to ban peanut butter tomorrow morning,\u2019\u201d Frennier said.\n\nMeanwhile, health officials have warned people against buying vaping products on the street or using marijuana-derived oil. They have said people should avoid inhaling vitamin E acetate, an ingredient found in some vaping products.\n\nNew York state Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker is evaluating a proposal to extend the ban on flavored e-cigarettes to cover menthol, which was excluded from the prohibition approved on Tuesday, Cuomo\u2019s office said.\n\nJuul Labs Inc, the leading U.S. e-cigarette maker, has insisted that it \u201cnever marketed to youth, period,\u201d although the company has said it regretted that some of its early advertising \u201cwas executed in a way that was perceived as appealing to minors.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Juul Labs spokesman Ted Kwong said the company agreed with the need for \u201caggressive category-wide action on flavored products,\u201d adding that it \u201cwill fully comply with local laws.\u201d Juul last year pulled many of its flavors from retail stores and suspended its social media accounts in an effort to curb use among teenagers.", "description": "New York became the second state to ban flavored e-cigarettes on Tuesday after its Democratic governor called for emergency action in response to concerns about their rising use among teens and a nationwide spate of lung illnesses.", "authors": ["Alex Dobuzinskis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431055495&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G23R", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
