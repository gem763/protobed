(Reuters)\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. \u2014 The scoreboard at Audi field had four goals for the USMNT by the time this CONCACAF Nations League opener against overmatched Cuba was a dozen minutes old.\n\nWhen the final whistle sounded, the Americans had run out 7-0 winners, with Weston McKennie making history by recording the fastest hat trick from the opening whistle in the program\u2019s 106-year history. Jordan Morris, Josh Sargent and Christian Pulisic also scored, and Cuban defender Dario Ramos Morales was guilty of an own goal.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nMcKennie put the hosts in front after just 31 seconds off a low cross from Morris, and added another goal off a nearly identical play moments later. He set up Morris for the third goal inside 10 minutes, and then polished off his hat trick in the 13th minute.\n\nHere are all three goals McKennie scored:\n\nAnd at that point, the rout was officially on.\n\nDespite the visitors\u2019 lack of resistance \u2014 the Cuban program has seen more than 20 defections over the last year alone\u2014 it was a badly needed win for the Americans, and not because the U.S. needs to ensure its place in the final round of qualifying for the 2022 World Cup next year.\n\nStory continues\n\nLike CONCACAF top dog Mexico, the No. 2-ranked Americans are virtually guaranteed to make the six-team cut. But after losing consecutive matches to El Tri this summer and tying powerful Uruguay in its last outing, Friday\u2019s victory should give Gregg Berhalter\u2019s side a much-needed confidence boost ahead of Tuesday\u2019s significantly more difficult tilt against desperate Canada in Toronto.\n\nThe Nations League has no shortage of detractors, for obvious reasons. The new competition, modeled on Europe\u2019s tournament of the same name, replaces the semifinal round of World Cup qualifying \u2014 a six game slog with little margin for error that both Mexico and the U.S. have struggled through in cycles past. The ease with which the hosts dispatched Cuba only reinforced the notion that for the regional powers, the competition is \u201ca waste of time\u201d, in the words of former U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann.\n\nFirst impressions matter, to be sure. But if the American team or its fans are expecting the final three Nations League games of 2019 to go the way this one did, they could be in for a rude awakening.\n\nCanadian coach John Herdman has been calling next week\u2019s border clash at BMO a final for weeks, and his much-improved side knows that it has a legitimate chance to beat the Americans for the first time in more than three decades, and that doing so could help them leapfrog Panama and El Salvador in the FIFA rankings. Same goes for the rematch in Orlando next month.\n\n[ Follow Yahoo Soccer on Twitter and Facebook ]\n\nMeantime, the return leg against Cuba will be played in the Cayman Islands \u2014 just the sort of locale the U.S. has often struggled in during the now-defunct semifinal qualifying round. Another 7-0 result there is unlikely. Assuming the Americans make it through to next June\u2019s final four, they\u2019ll have their work cut out for them. Costa Rica always plays the Americans tough, and Mexico has beaten the USMNT on home soil the last four times the neighbors have met in a final.\n\nThose games won\u2019t look anything like Friday\u2019s rout. For a team trying to get back to the World Cup and also win, they most certainly won\u2019t be a waste of time.\n\nAnd the challenge for the U.S. remains bigger than that, of course. In addition to winning games, Berhalter is also charged with restoring pride to the national team, to win back the supporters who remain cynical more than two years after the qualifying disaster in Trinidad.\n\nThat\u2019s understandable. Yet his squad can only play the opponent in front of it. It\u2019s hard to argue with a result that tied a team record for the second-largest margin of victory. The 13,784 fans who showed up on this night \u2014 well short of a full house, it must be said \u2014 surely went home happy, even if keeping them that way won\u2019t be as easy.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The young midfielder recorded the fastest hat trick from the opening whistle in program history and the Americans were never troubled in Washington, D.C.", "authors": ["Doug Mcintyre"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/dYP0JWiKiG3WsdpyM0UctQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TEHx9XkflQ.D6Fm9IN3piA--~B/aD0xMjI1O3c9MTgzNztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/d1474930-ec8b-11e9-9cd7-7cb3ee895e18", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
