Some of these cards also offer benefits that, while not as glamorous, can help you save money or get a refund for certain products.\n\nPurchase protection is one such credit card feature that protects consumers when they buy eligible products with their card. This coverage allows you to receive reimbursement if a product is stolen or damaged in most cases, although the amount of coverage can vary. Coverage can easily be worth up to $1,000 per item, although annual caps of up to $50,000 can also apply.\n\nKeep in mind that we're focusing on the rewards and perks that make these credit cards great options, not things like interest rates and late fees, which will far outweigh the value of any points or miles. It's important to practice financial discipline when using credit cards by paying your balances in full each month, making payments on time, and only spending what you can afford to pay back.\n\nHow credit card purchase protection works\n\nLet's say that, for example, you buy a laptop computer for $900 and pay with a credit card that offers purchase protection. If your laptop is stolen from your car or damaged during your credit cards' purchase protection coverage window, you could be reimbursed \u2014 with the amount depending on the specific of your card's coverage.\n\nMost credit cards that offer purchase protection offer coverage for 90 to 120 days after you make a purchase, and the coverage amount may vary depending on the state you live in.\n\nThe best credit cards for purchase protection in 2019\n\nAs you explore credit cards that offer purchase protection, keep in mind that many offer other perks like cash back or travel rewards, travel credits, airport lounge access, and more.\n\nHere are some of the absolute best credit cards for purchase protection available in 2019, 2020, and beyond:\n\nHow purchase protection works among payment networks\n\nThe credit cards above offer some of the most valuable purchase protection coverage available today, but keep in mind that different credit card networks set standards for their coverage that most of the credit cards adhere to.

You may want to look for credit cards that also offer extended warranties or price protection, for example.\n\nExtended warranties\n\nWith credit card extended warranties, you can qualify for an additional year or longer of warranty protection after the manufacturer warranty on eligible items runs out.\n\nLet's say you purchase a refrigerator that comes with a two-year warranty, for example. If your refrigerator stopped working a month after the manufacturer's warranty ends, a credit card that offered an additional year of extended warranty coverage might pay for the required costs involved in repairing or replacing your refrigerator.\n\nSome of the best credit cards that offer extended warranties include:\n\nPrice protection\n\nCredit card price protection works differently, but it can be just as useful. With price protection, you can typically be reimbursed for the difference if you pay for an item and the price goes down within a specific length of time, usually up to 120 days.\n\nThis type of coverage can be beneficial if you want to purchase a big ticket item but worry the price may go down in the future for any reason, including a pending sale.\n\nSome of the best credit cards that offer price protection coverage include:\n\nUnited MileagePlus Club Card\n\nWells Fargo Visa Signature Credit Card\n\nCapital One Walmart Rewards Mastercard\n\nThe bottom line\n\nSince credit cards offer lucrative rewards schemes that let you score cash back, free travel, and more, it can be easy to overlook all the other benefits they offer.\n\nHowever, purchase protection and similar benefits can pay off in a big way over time if you wind up having to use them.
