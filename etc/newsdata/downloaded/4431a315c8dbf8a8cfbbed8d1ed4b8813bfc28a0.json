It isn\u2019t hiding anything; its glass facade on Orchard Street wants to strike up a conversation so badly that it almost follows you home. The windows are stenciled with cartoon characters and with text-message bubbles that call out in English (\u201cHello! New York\u201d), Spanish (\u201cque rico!\u201d), French (\u201cbon app\u00e9tit\u201d) and Tagalog (\u201cmasarap,\u201d for delicious).\n\nThe language lessons continue on the front door, which gives translations for \u201ctuloy po kayo\u201d (welcome) and the restaurant\u2019s name (gossip), pronounced chiss-miss. In case you miss all of this, a sandwich board straddles the sidewalk, advertising discounted beer, wine and wings at the bar during happy hour (\u201c5:thirsty\u201d).\n\nIf you accept the facade\u2019s invitation to benaquitodits (come here here, a repetitive bit of Tagalog slang), the conversation will continue inside. Tsismis, which opened in June, is a chatty restaurant. At times, when one of the owners pulls up alongside your table and expounds on how the chef\u2019s interpretation of the dish you\u2019re trying to eat differs from what you might find in the Philippines, you may find yourself eyeing the exit. If you\u2019ve found your way to the menu\u2019s strengths, though, odds are you won\u2019t want to go anywhere.", "description": "Tagalog language lessons begin the meal at this Filipino restaurant on the Lower East Side.", "authors": ["Pete Wells"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/22/dining/22REST-TSIS-slide-WZ3A/22REST-TSIS-slide-WZ3A-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
