De la Rosa arrived on the scene and burst past the police tape, demanding to know the name of the man who had been shot and where he had been taken.\n\nThe officers ignored her questions. They told her to step back beyond the police line.\n\nIn an emotional fog, she and her sister drove to the nearest medical facility. No one had any information.\n\nHours went by as she battled back rage, fear and uncertainty. A devout churchgoer, she prayed for God to deliver good news about her 22-year-old son.\n\nAfter the police killed her son, a mother fights for answers Harrison Hill, USA TODAY\n\n\"I kept asking anyone I saw, 'Did they bring someone in, a young Mexican-American man?' But no one could tell me anything because it was an officer-involved shooting,\" says de la Rosa, 54, soberly recalling that 2014 night from her modest living room.\n\n\u201cFinally, the coroner came out, and I had to identify him by a tattoo,\u201d she says, wiping away a tear. \u201cThat\u2019s how I found out he was dead.\u201d\n\nDe la Rosa would later learn that one officer who was assigned to stay with her son's body decided to play with it, moving James de la Rosa's head to see if it would move back, and tickling the corpse's toes.\n\nBakersfield Police rallied behind the four officers in the shooting. De la Rosa retained attorney Mark Geragos to sue the police department over the body tampering, in the process learning that some of the officers involved in her son's shooting had participated in other shootings of civilians.\n\n\"Here, state law shields police officer records, and families like mine rarely get answers to the questions we ask,\" says de la Rosa. \"All we get is secrecy.\"\n\nThe mounting injustices surrounding her son's death \u2014 local police \"never showed any compassion,\" she says, staying silent before and after the shooting on the four officers involved \u2014 inspired de la Rosa to make a fierce commitment to social change.\n\nShow caption Hide caption Jamilia Land, a friend of the family of police shooting victim Stephon Clark, holds up a cell phone during a hearing on legislation to restrict... Jamilia Land, a friend of the family of police shooting victim Stephon Clark, holds up a cell phone during a hearing on legislation to restrict the use of deadly force by police, Tuesday, April 9, 2019, in Sacramento, Calif. Sacramento Police officers mistook the cell phone Clark was holding for a gun when he was shot and killed in 2018. Rich Pedroncelli, AP\n\nFurious about the way she was treated, she worked with other families whose relatives were killed by police to help push for the recent passage of California's new Senate Bill 1421, which as of January 1 overrides decades of precedent and requires police departments to open internal investigation records related to deadly force and police wrongdoing.\n\nThe law could inspire reform at police departments across the nation at a time when the relationship between police and the public is fraught with tension following numerous fatal shootings, particularly involving victims of color.\n\nBattle over officer conduct records\n\nCalifornia is not the only state where records documenting the conduct of police officers were kept from public view, sometimes by local decision makers and sometimes by state law.\n\nA USA TODAY investigation found examples coast to coast of powerful forces working to keep records about law enforcement officers\u2019 conduct \u2013 and misconduct \u2013 secret. Those forces include police departments and their officers\u2019 unions, state agencies created to oversee police, legislators, prosecutors and judges.\n\nJournalists representing more than 100 USA TODAY Network newsrooms spent more than a year using state open records laws to collect public records about police conduct from thousands of police departments, local governments, prosecutors and state oversight agencies.\n\nAs reporters requested the documents, dozens of police agencies ignored repeated requests made under states\u2019 open records laws. Other agencies denied requests, saying sharing the information with the public violates officers\u2019 privacy rights or is not in the public\u2019s best interest.\n\nSearch for police discipline records USA TODAY Network has gathered discipline and accountability records on more than 85,000 law enforcement officers and has started releasing them to the public. The first collection published is a list of more than 30,000 officers who have been decertified, essentially banned from the profession, in 44 states. Search our exclusive database by officer, department or state. Search database\n\nEven state agencies assigned to oversee law enforcement officers frequently refused to release the reasons why they acted to decertify certain officers \u2013 effectively banning them from the profession in their states.\n\nOne state, Delaware, wouldn\u2019t release the names of officers it has banned at all \u2013 making it the only state in the union to deny that request. The state also doesn\u2019t report the identity of its decertified officers to the national clearinghouse some police agencies use to screen new hires, effectively hiding that information from potential employers in 49 states.\n\nNew York, Michigan, Oklahoma and several other states wouldn\u2019t release the identifies of any police officers, saying that because some of them could be working undercover at some point, releasing information about any officers posed a threat.\n\nWhile hundreds of local police departments across the country did release disciplinary records, many did not. Others so severely redacted them as to render them nearly useless.\n\nShow caption Hide caption Sacramento Police officers escort protesters from the Arden Fair Mall after they staged an overnight sit-in for Stephon Clark, who was killed by police, in... Sacramento Police officers escort protesters from the Arden Fair Mall after they staged an overnight sit-in for Stephon Clark, who was killed by police, in Sacramento, Calif., Sunday, March 3, 2019, following the Sacramento District Attorney's decision not to charge officers involved in last year's shooting of Clark. Lezlie Sterling, The Sacramento Bee via AP\n\nIn state after state, USA TODAY had to employ the assistance of its lawyers to gain access to the public records \u2013 a resource that citizens walking in the door searching for public information often don\u2019t have.\n\nThe records that USA TODAY Network and its partners are gathering are being published \u2013 and made searchable \u2013 to give the public an opportunity to examine their police department and the broader issue of police misconduct.\n\nInvestigation: We found 85,000 cops who\u2019ve been investigated for misconduct.

Meet the new police chief.\n\nFrom firearm use to sexual assault\n\nPolice officers say civilians have no way of understanding the pressures and dangers inherent in their daily work. Given the often violent and deadly nature of the job, records about officers are kept secret, many police unions argue, in order to protect them, and their families, from retaliation and harassment.\n\nLaw enforcement critics, however, argue a culture of self-interested silence protects officers whose conduct is suspect or illegal.\n\nShare your stories of police misconduct with us We want to hear from you if you believe you\u2019ve encountered misconduct by a law enforcement officer or agency.

The culture of secrecy here dates back to the 1970s, when the Los Angeles Police Department, upset that past complaints against them were showing up in court cases, purged three decades of officer files.\n\nThe state Legislature responded in 1978 by passing a law mandating that records be preserved while ensuring that access to those documents by the public would be difficult to come by.\n\nNow, SB 1421, or \"Peace Officers: Release of Records,\" is aimed at making police records accessible to the public and officers accountable to the community.\n\nShow caption Hide caption Last September, then-governor Jerry Brown signed California Senate Bill 1421 into law, effective January 1, 2019.

The law requires state police departments to provide the public with reports and documents related to violent incidents that involve police officers. Getty Images/Deutsche Welle\n\nSpecifically, it allows the public to leverage the California Public Records Act to unseal internal investigation material in any incident where a firearm was discharged by a peace officer; where use of force resulted in injury or death; where instances of sexual assault by police on civilians were reported; and where an officer was suspected of lying on police reports.\n\nThe accessible evidence can include recordings of incidents or interviews, autopsy reports and correspondence with officials on disciplinary actions.\n\nThe law is already generating pushback, with some police departments across California filing lawsuits to prevent access to any personnel records that predate the law citing violations of officer rights. Media companies, including the USA TODAY Network, are working together to get these records to give the public a glimpse inside the men and women who police their towns.\n\nRonald Lawrence, president of the California Police Chiefs Association, says that because for decades releasing information about police officers was illegal and could draw lawsuits from officers, some departments remain hesitant to comply with the new law.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re trying to stonewall, we\u2019re just proceeding with an abundance of caution as the law gets sorted out,\u201d says Lawrence, who also serves as police chief of Citrus Heights, a town of 80,000 near Sacramento.\n\nLawrence adds that most police officers \u201cperform admirably daily,\u201d and argues that the new police transparency law will \u201cdemonstrate that we do have a strong system of accountability, up to and including termination. We are human and make mistakes, but very few officers tarnish the flag.\u201d\n\nSan Francisco police recruits look on during a news conference at the San Francisco Police Academy on May 15, 2018. Justin Sullivan, Getty Images\n\nNancy Skinner, a state senator from Berkeley who introduced 1421, says \"sunshine is a great disinfectant,\u201d noting that complying with the law should benefit departments.\n\n\"For law enforcement to do their job, they need the community\u2019s trust,\" says Skinner. \"When you block access to information from the public, that trust will not be there.\u201d\n\nShe's blunt about the retroactive question.\n\n\"This bill repealed a section of the penal code that prevented these records from being released,\" she says. \"If you have a record, it's disclosable.\"\n\n'What are you hiding?'\n\nFor the last decade, Cephus X. Johnson, who goes by the nickname \"Uncle Bobby,\" has been fighting to hold California police officers accountable. His nephew, Oscar Grant, was killed by Bay Area Rapid Transit officers on Jan. 1, 2009, an incident that was chronicled in the fictional film \u201cFruitvale Station.\u201d He supports SB 1421.\n\n\u201cThis new law can shed a light on problematic officers, so it\u2019s part of a move toward accountability that we need,\u201d says Johnson.\n\nShow caption Hide caption In this 2010 photo, John Burris, left, the Oscar Grant family attorney, and Cephus \"Uncle Bobby\" Johnson, right, express their disappointment outside a Los Angeles...

Damian Dovarganes, AP\n\nJohnson, an Oakland-based social justice advocate, says that when police officers aren\u2019t charged appropriately for their acts \u2014 Grant\u2019s shooter, Officer Johannes Mehserle, was charged with involuntary manslaughter, not murder \u2014 \u201cthe community loses trust.\u201d\n\nTheresa Smith lost her son Caesar Cruz in December 2009 when he was shot 15 times by Anaheim officers in a Walmart parking lot.\n\nActing on a tip, the police officers pulled Cruz over for a broken taillight, thinking he was a gang member and drug dealer, according to reports. Cruz did not have a weapon in his hands, but a gun was found with its safety on in the passenger\u2019s seat.\n\nSmith immediately tried to find out all she could about the incident. She quickly realized she could not review police documents and video footage, and could not learn anything about the informant on whose information police had acted.\n\nFor Smith \u2014 founder of the Law Enforcement Accountability Network, which provides support and resources for California victims of police brutality \u2014 SB 1421 represents the first glimmer of hope that she might find out what really happened that day.\n\nShow caption Hide caption Theresa Smith, right, the mother of Caesar Cruz, who was killed in a confrontation with police, wipes her eyes after testifying against a police-backed law...

So we just feel officers should be held to a higher standard than regular people.\u201d\n\nEfforts on the part of some police departments to push back against the law angers Smith. \u201cA lot of us family members simply ask, 'what are you hiding?'\u201d she says. \u201cYou can\u2019t build community if you don\u2019t release the information.\u201d\n\n'Like a bomb went off'\n\nWhen James de la Rosa was a little boy, police officers were not the scourge of his community. In fact, says his mother, he wanted to be one.\n\n\"But then as he grew up and saw the way some of his friends were treated, how some were killed, he changed his mind,\" says Leticia de la Rosa. \"But at his core, he was a peacemaker.\"\n\nOver the years, Leticia de la Rosa pieced together what happened that fatal night five years ago. Toward the end of a night out, James de la Rosa stopped at a gas station about a mile from the family home.\n\nSpotting police cars, he got nervous and left. Police pursued his Jeep Liberty, which crashed a few minutes later. Getting out of the car with his hands up, de la Rosa was perceived to be reaching into his waistband. Officers, feeling threatened, opened fire, killing James. No weapon was found.\n\nLeticia de la Rosa points to old images of her son James inside of her Bakersfield home. Harrison Hill, USA TODAY\n\n\u201cJames was six foot and 360 pounds most of his life, but in the last year of his life he had become a gym rat and lost 100 pounds, so I think he was just pulling up his pants when he reached down, because most of his clothes were too big,\u201d Leticia de la Rosa says. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair. He should still be here.\u201d\n\nThe entire extended de la Rosa clan reeled \u2014 siblings, nieces and nephews, uncles and aunts. De la Rosa is one of 11 children born to a Purple Heart-decorated World War II veteran turned agriculture worker who settled in Bakersfield. She herself has six children; she demurs when asked about the father of her kids.\n\nIf you think this is important journalism, please support us.

Inside, she aims to keep things tidy, paying particular attention to the shrine of photos dedicated to her youngest son. Outside, her low-income neighborhood is rife with dirt front yards and barred up windows.\n\nFor many in the family, James' passing hit hard.\n\n\u201cIt was like a bomb went off in our family,\u201d says Leticia de la Rosa, sitting in her living room filled with framed photos and collages featuring James, with the hard hat he wore on his oil rig job prominently displayed.\n\nAthena Rodriguez, 15, one of James de la Rosa's cousins, said she feels for any family who might go through what her family was made to endure.\n\n\u201cThe last time I saw him, that night he died, he just said \u2018You\u2019re beautiful, and I love you,\u2019\u201d says Athena Rodriguez, 15, one of James de la Rosa's cousins. \u201cIt hurts to think about every day, knowing they won\u2019t be back. And it hurts to think that other families have to go through this.\u201d\n\nBut for Leticia de la Rosa, James\u2019s death sparked not only a sorrow tinged with rage, but also a commitment to see to it that other mothers like her maybe wouldn\u2019t have to go through the same information void she did after her son died.\n\nContacted by other victims\u2019 rights groups, de la Rosa was taught how to raise her voice. She protested in front of the Bakersfield Police Department, and learned about her own rights through the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nEric Marmolejo places white flowers next to the headstone of his cousin, James de la Rosa. Harrison Hill, USA TODAY\n\nEventually, de la Rosa made her way to the state capitol in Sacramento where she, along with others, shared her story with lawmakers and helped Skinner get the legislative votes necessary for then-Gov. Jerry Brown to sign 1421 into law in September.\n\nHer voice carried particular weight because she was representing a city whose police department was coming under fierce scrutiny.\n\nIn a 2015 report by MappingPoliceViolence.org, Bakersfield emerged as the seat of the deadliest county in the U.S., with 13 killings by cops that year compared to nine in New York, which has 10 times the population and 23 times the officers.\n\nDe la Rosa\u2019s story also generated outrage for the fact that the police officer assigned to guard her son\u2019s body was accused of playing with the body. A year later, the officer, Aaron Stringer, was suddenly no longer on the force. Further details were not provided.\n\nBakersfield Police Department did not respond to repeated inquiries from USA TODAY to comment on the de la Rosa case or SB 1421.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s important for the public to see is that the victims in these police cases are not faceless, they\u2019re fathers and mothers and sons and daughters, who were denied even the most basic information in the aftermath,\u201d says Melanie Ochoa, staff attorney with the ACLU of Southern California.\n\n\u201cToo often,\" she says, \"the only person with the microphone after these incidents is the police chief. That needs to change.\u201d\n\nLiving with a ghost\n\nLeticia de la Rosa didn't expect to ever be in the spotlight in her lifetime.\n\nBut, she says, \"the police messed with the wrong family, and I'm not going away because I'm here for him.\"\n\nWhen de la Rosa closes her eyes or fires up her smartphone, her son James is there, doing that silly shimmy of his. One hand above his head, another on his stomach, eyes closed, mouth smiling.\n\n\u201cHe was my happy feet guy, always dancing, even if there was no music,\u201d she says softly. \u201cI want to wake up and have it be a do-over and James is going to walk through that door. But I know it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nShow caption Hide caption Leticia de la Rosa and her family spend the evening at Greenlawn Cemetery to celebrate the birthday of James de la Rosa. \"Everyone I meet... Leticia de la Rosa and her family spend the evening at Greenlawn Cemetery to celebrate the birthday of James de la Rosa. \"Everyone I meet and I interact with is going to know that James was my son,\" said de la Rosa. \"He was amazing.\" James de la Rosa would have turned 27. Harrison Hill, USA TODAY\n\nDe la Rosa doesn\u2019t go out much since her son's death.\n\nShe\u2019s a cafeteria employee with the Bakersfield City School District, and when she\u2019s not at school or in church, she\u2019s at home \u2014 often lying in bed in James\u2019 old room, which still has his belongings everywhere.\n\nThere are the pin-up posters, cut-outs of Honda cars, shirts and sweatpants on a dresser, a Happy New Year crown. In one corner sits his gym equipment. She doesn\u2019t plan to move a thing.\n\n\u201cHe was my son, and he\u2019s the reason I fight today,\u201d she says. \u201cHe won\u2019t come back, but if one family is helped by these laws, then that\u2019s justice for my son. They took my baby and I\u2019m going to fight for him.\u201d\n\nThe family started an annual march Walk for Justice, which initially drew mainly locals but more recently has included affected families from around the West.\n\nThere\u2019s also an annual baseball game in James' memory for local friends and relatives around his birthday, April 24. James de la Rosa was an avid baseball player as a kid, but a positively rabid football fan as an adult. He was a fan of the Los Angeles Rams, so much so that his coffin featured an air-brushed Rams logo along with jerseys draped across the wooden box.\n\nThat coffin is now deep in the ground at Greenlawn Cemetery on a bluff overlooking a valley.\n\nDe la Rosa and extended family come here often. They decorate James\u2019s grave marker for every holiday. She says homeless people sometimes come by and take the trinkets. No matter. She just brings more.\n\nLeticia de la Rosa and her family spend the evening at Greenlawn Cemetery to celebrate the birthday of James de la Rosa. Harrison Hill, USA TODAY\n\nOn a recent sunny morning, de la Rosa, Jesse Rodriguez and others gathered to pay their respects to James as what would have been his 27th birthday neared. They set up lawn chairs. There was coffee from McDonald\u2019s and a few donuts.\n\nDe la Rosa often is teary-eyed as she stares at her son's gravestone. But she instantly gets happy whenever she shares a memory of her son. Stories about a trimmed down young man who hated it when family members fought. Who had dreams of making it in the oil fields so he could take care of his mother. Who loved to dance.\n\n\u201cJames did not deserve to die that night, not at the hands of those people who we trust to protect our lives,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had people tell me to move on, but these people haven\u2019t walked in my shoes,\u201d says de la Rosa, her voice rising. \u201cSo I\u2019ll fight for justice for James until they put me six feet under.
