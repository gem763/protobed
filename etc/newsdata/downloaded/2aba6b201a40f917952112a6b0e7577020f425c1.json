The macaques breed of monkeys are small, relatively light primates, which are often used for animal experiments at LPT.\n\n'They are kept in cramped conditions in small cages. Many of the animals have developed compulsive tendencies and are seen going round in circles.'\n\nThe cats are said to be given up to 13 injections per day by untrained professionals and left to suffer.\n\nThe animal activists have reported the case to police who are investigating.\n\nThey also claim the laws in Germany protecting animals from experiments are not strict enough and call for the laws to be tightened.\n\nLPT is a family-owned contract-testing laboratory carrying out toxicity testing for pharmaceutical, industrial and agro-chemical companies from all over the world in order to meet the requirements of governments and regulatory authorities.\n\nFootage shows the monkeys exhibiting obsessive behaviours, including going round in circles in their cages\n\nMacaque monkeys are strapped into their harnesses during testing at the suspected toxicology laboratory\n\nAccording to the organisation Cruelty Free International: 'Toxicity testing involves poisoning animals to see how much of a chemical or drug it takes to cause serious harm, in an attempt to measure what a \"safe\" dose for humans might be.\n\n'Animals are injected with or made to eat or inhale increasing amounts of a substance to measure the toxic effects which can be severe and include vomiting, internal bleeding, respiratory distress, fever, weight loss, lethargy, skin problems, organ failure and even death. No anaesthetics or pain relief are provided.'\n\nMichelle Thew, Chief Executive of Cruelty Free International stated: 'Our investigation has uncovered appalling animal suffering, inadequate care, poor practices and breaches of European and German law.\n\n'We are calling for the Laboratory of Pharmacology and Toxicology (LPT) to be closed. We are also calling for a comprehensive review into the use of animals in regulatory toxicity testing in Europe, including the UK.\n\n'Every investigation, without fail, shows a similar tale of misery and disregard of the law.'\n\nThe MailOnline has attempted to contact the LPT Laboratory of Pharmacology and Toxicology for comment.", "description": "Footage showed macaques strapped to metal brackets in rows on the wall, their heads locked in restraints, allegedly at LPT\u00a0Laboratory near Hamburg.", "authors": ["Ross Ibbetson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/12/19738538-0-image-a-68_1571140024653.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
