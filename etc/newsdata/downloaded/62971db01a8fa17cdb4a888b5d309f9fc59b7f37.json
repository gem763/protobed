Tulsi Gabbard of being a Russian agent. Or, words to that effect.\n\nMore accurately, in a podcast hosted by former Obama apparatchik David Plouffe, Clinton said candidate Gabbard is \u201cthe favorite of the Russians\u201d and suggested Moscow was supporting her bid through fake social media postings.\n\nSince Gabbard is only polling at 1.2 percent, according to the Real Clear Politics average, Russia doesn\u2019t seem to be helping much. More important, there is zero evidence that any such meddling has occurred.\n\nBRUCE ASHFORD: BETO'S ATTACK ON RELIGIOUS LIBERTY NOT JUST WRONG BUT DISASTROUS \u2014 HERE ARE FOUR REASONS WHY\n\nWhat on earth could have prompted such an outlandish charge? We can start with Clinton\u2019s enduring belief that the Russians were behind her 2016 defeat, in addition to James Comey, misogyny, Bernie Sanders, the Electoral College, the media and innumerable other villains. Hillary has never owned up to having been a widely distrusted, politically inept and arrogant candidate who simply lost an election.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate, because her inability to take responsibility for the unexpected 2016 loss has helped divide the country and has also made her a laughing stock. Unlike most former candidates, Hillary has seen her approval ratings drop since her campaign, and especially among Democrats. In September 2018, two years after the election, Clinton\u2019s approval stood at 36 percent, an all-time low, and seven points below her ratings on the cusp of the 2016 vote. Among Democrats, her approval was down 11 points.\n\nAfter 17 years of being voted the most admired woman in the country, Hillary has fallen behind Michelle Obama and is tied with Melania Trump. Boy, that must rankle.\n\nBlame her interminable and whiny book, endless embarrassing speaking tours meant to keep her in the public eye and fluff up her already-copious bank account, and renewed scrutiny of the Clinton Foundation, which, not surprisingly, deflated as donors disappeared.\n\nBut mainly, blame her inability to move on, which has prompted her peculiar attack on Gabbard. The animus between the two is not new; in 2016, Gabbard committed the unforgivable sin of endorsing Bernie Sanders. At the time, Gabbard was vice-chair of the Democratic National Committee, which has been accused of tipping the primary contest to Hillary. Her apostasy, consequently, was profound.\n\nSome have speculated that Hillary is itching to throw her hat in the ring, hopeful a third campaign proves the charm.\n\nGabbard has also challenged Hillary, and the Democratic establishment, on foreign policy. When the Iraq war veteran came out in favor of Bernie, Gabbard described Hillary as someone who \u201cwill lead us into more interventionist wars of regime change.\u201d\n\nGabbard has fired back at Clinton\u2019s Russia comments, calling her the \u201cqueen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long\u2026.\u201d\n\nGabbard claims her camp has detected a \u201cconcerted campaign to destroy my reputation\u201d and now believes that Hillary, \u201cthrough her proxies and powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine, afraid of the threat I pose\u201d is behind that effort.\n\nThe assertion seems far-fetched; why would Hillary Clinton bother to take down a fellow Democrat who is so far behind the pack?\n\nMaybe because in her bitterness Hillary cannot endure anyone else \u2013 and especially another female \u2013 campaigning and possibly winning in 2020.\n\nGabbard has suggested as much, tweeting \u201cIt\u2019s now clear that this primary is between you and me\u2026 Join the race directly.\u201d\n\nSome have speculated that Hillary is itching to throw her hat in the ring, hopeful a third campaign proves the charm. Like many Democrats, she may consider Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is quickly becoming the favorite, too extreme to win a national election against Donald Trump.\n\nIn a recent interview with PBS\u2019 Judy Woodruff, Clinton said, \"So maybe there does need to be a re-match. I mean, obviously I can beat him again.\" She later said she was joking.\n\nRecently, baited to jump in by President Trump on Twitter Hillary responded \u201cDon\u2019t tempt me. Do your job.\u201d\n\nBefore she enters the race, Hillary should review what voters are saying about another run. A recent Rasmussen poll shows that fully 71 percent of voters say she should not run, including 58 percent of her own party. That\u2019s not a great starting point.\n\nThough Hillary is quite positive she would win, suggesting in a CBS interview that \u201cthere were many funny things that happened in my election that will not happen again,\u201d the Rasmussen survey tells a different story.\n\nIn that poll, she ties Trump in a head-to-head match-up. But remember that on the eve of the 2016 election the polling was unequivocally in her favor. At that time The Daily Beast posted a jubilant column, \u201cHillary Clinton Leads All Final Polls,\u201d noting a Monmouth poll had the former Secretary of State up by 6 points, while a tracking poll by ABC News and the Washington Post had her ahead by 4 points. It may be, given the apparent bias in Trump surveys, that running even is not good enough.\n\nThree other findings should give her pause. The first is that in that imaginary contest, Clinton wins only 60 percent of the black vote. In 2016, she walked away with 88 percent of that vote. That possible leakage of black votes, which I\u2019ve noted before, is a real danger sign for Hillary, and for Democrats.\n\nSecond, only 42 percent of those surveyed think the country would be better off today if Clinton had been elected. Fully 48 percent disagree. That\u2019s an astonishing conclusion, given the daily battering the president receives from the media and his low job approval ratings.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFinally, only 54 percent of Democrats think Hillary won the nomination in 2016 fairly. Imagine the reaction is she was to jump in today, or if she were to be nominated by a deadlocked convention. The remaining dozen or so candidates, and their supporters, would erupt; most likely, a great many would stay home.\n\nIt\u2019s time for Hillary to retire to the sidelines. Stop embarrassing Democrats, and herself.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY LIZ PEEK", "description": "Before she enters the 2020 race, Hillary Clinton should review what voters are saying about another run.", "authors": ["Liz Peek", "Liz Peek Is A Fox News Contributor", "Former Partner Of Major Bracket Wall Street Firm Wertheim", "Company.
