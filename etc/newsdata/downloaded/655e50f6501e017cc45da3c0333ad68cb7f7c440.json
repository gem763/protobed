REUTERS/Erin Scott\n\n(Reuters) - A U.S. House of Representatives committee will hear closed-door testimony from the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general on Oct. 4, a congressional official said on Friday.\n\nThe hearing before the House Intelligence Committee relates to the whistleblower report alleging President Donald Trump abused his office in attempting to solicit Ukraine\u2019s interference in the 2020 U.S. election for his political benefit.\n\nThe inspector general, Michael Atkinson, a Trump appointee, determined that the whistleblower\u2019s report was credible.\n\nAtkinson was also concerned that Trump potentially exposed himself to \u201cserious national security and counter-intelligence risks\u201d when he pressed his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden and his son during a July 25 phone call, according to a Justice Department legal opinion.\n\nThe telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is central to an impeachment investigation announced this week by Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the Democratic-led House of Representatives.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry has cast a new pall over Trump\u2019s presidency just months after he emerged from the shadow cast by Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into whether he colluded with Russia in the 2016 election.\n\nTrump has reacted furiously, arguing he did nothing wrong, and accusing Democrats of launching a politically motivated \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nTrump had ordered $400 million in military aid and foreign assistance for Ukraine to be put on hold a week before the call, and lifted the freeze earlier this month.\n\nTrump denies he pressured Zelenskiy to do anything improper and said he was not using the aid as leverage, but wanted to make sure Ukraine was taking steps to address corruption.", "description": "A U.S. House of Representatives committee will hear closed-door testimony from the intelligence community's inspector general on Oct. 4, a congressional official said on Friday.", "authors": ["Jan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434690391&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q1Z9", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
