The stock\u2019s lockup expiry also contributed to the weakness.\n\nA boost to the company\u2019s sales outlook might not be enough to impress investors with already elevated expectations for the plant-based burger maker, ahead of a likely increase in near-term competitive pressures, analysts said. The low-end of the revised forecast may also suggest fourth-quarter sales could slow from the third quarter pace, Jefferies analysts said.\n\nJefferies, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan were among banks that lowered price targets on the stock, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nResults were also overshadowed by Tuesday\u2019s expiration of insider-selling restrictions. Under the arrangement, about 75% of shares outstanding become eligible for sale today, according to an Oct. 28 note from Sanford C. Bernstein. Beyond Meat was already down 29% month-to-date ahead of the expiry.\n\nBeyond Meat shares fell as much as 24% to $80 per share in intraday trading in New York Tuesday. The stock hasn\u2019t traded that low since May 24. Shares have trimmed their post-IPO gains to 237%.\n\nHere\u2019s a summary of analyst views following the earnings report:\n\nJefferies, Kevin Grundy\n\n(Hold, PT cut to $115 from $190)\n\nQuarterly results beat across the board, but while full-year guidance was raised, it may not be enough to clear the high bar set by the Street, particularly as competitive intensity ramps up and the end of a lockup weighs on the shares. Moreover, the low-end of updated 2019 guidance implies a sequential deceleration in the fourth quarter.\n\nEven so, Beyond Meat is perhaps the best early stage growth story in staples with significant scope to expand penetration globally.\n\nWells Fargo, John Joseph Baumgartner\n\n(Market perform, PT cut to $100 from $125)\n\nWith competitive entrants ramping up through the first half of fiscal 2020, expect Beyond Meat to increase its promotions. There\u2019s also a need for higher operational expenditure to support domestic brand investment and to build up international capabilities.\n\nAmid limited visibility and likely \u201ccompetitive turbulence\u201d in fiscal 2020, continue to recommend Danone SA and Nomad Foods Ltd. for exposure to long-term plant-based theme.\n\nQuarterly net sales \u201ceasily\u201d beat the Street, but a \u201crich\u201d valuation already reflects high expectations.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence, Jennifer Bartashus\n\nRevenue growth and a first quarterly profit is a positive step toward long-term sustainable earnings, but is excessively overshadowed by uncertainty around the effects of exiting its post-IPO lockup period.\n\nWhile rapid international expansion could be a boon, it runs the risk of splitting focus during the company\u2019s \u201cstill-nascent\u201d growth. Gross margin could be affected by investments to help drive product prices closer to parity with meat counterparts, but can potentially be offset by cost-control initiatives.\n\nProduct traction points to a long-term opportunity versus a fad.\n\n(Updates with intraday trading in the first, fifth paragraphs.)\n\n--With assistance from James Cone.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Joe Easton in London at jeaston7@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Beth Mellor at bmellor@bloomberg.net, Paul Jarvis, Richard Richtmyer\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Beyond Meat Inc. lost more than a fifth of its value on Tuesday as analysts cut their price targets following results that raised questions about rising competition, slowing growth and higher operational costs.
