Which is strange because I live in Norway, the land of the polar night.\n\nFor eight years I lived in Svalbard, an archipelago midway between Norway and the North Pole. Here, it is pitch-black 24 hours a day in the middle of winter. There isn\u2019t any twilight. No blue hour. No grey. It\u2019s just as dark in the middle of the day as at night, and this lasts for eight weeks.\n\nI dread the darkness so much that I can feel the pain in my chest and down in my feet. Even the word gives me a kind of jolt. It has connotations of grief and illness and night and the colour black.\n\nNorwegian bestseller An Ode To Darkness has been serialised for the Daily Mail (Stock image)\n\nHumankind has always struggled with both metaphorical and literal darkness. It is an enemy, like the cold; it is unsafe \u2014 whereas light is associated with truth and knowledge and what is good.\n\nOf course, we need light, but are we now getting too much?\n\nThere are stories about people who went mad in Svalbard, but it wasn\u2019t during the polar night \u2014 it was when light returned in spring. The midnight sun hangs in the sky 24 hours a day, as early as April 19. We smeared washing-up liquid on the windows and put up aluminium foil, so we could sleep.\n\nSleep is so important. It gives our bodies the peace they need to carry out their other functions, such as repair tissue, flush and rebuild brain cells, store memories, forget things that don\u2019t matter, and get rid of waste.\n\nIf we don\u2019t get enough, we become more susceptible to conditions such as type 2 diabetes and obesity.\n\nNight shifts, which can lead to less sleep and a disrupted circadian rhythm, have been linked to strokes, heart attacks and some forms of cancer.\n\nThirty per cent of us sometimes have trouble sleeping, while ten per cent always do, and this figure seems to be increasing. It is a global epidemic. Of course, sleeplessness has many causes, but might it have something to do with all the artificial light we are now exposed to?\n\nNight shifts have been linked to strokes, heart attacks and some forms of cancer (Stock image)\n\nIt was only after 1950 that most Norwegian homes had electric lights. When the incandescent bulb was introduced, our sleep time was reduced by 90 minutes, on average. The EU banned these in 2012.\n\nAs LED bulbs are more energy-efficient, there are lights on everywhere now. More electricity was used in Norway in 2017 than ever before. And it\u2019s not just here: pictures taken by Nasa show a dramatic increase in light pollution in the past 20 years worldwide. Sleep disorders are on the rise, too.\n\nThe key to the problem is melatonin, the \u2018darkness\u2019 hormone produced by our pineal gland when the photoreceptors in our eyes register that it\u2019s getting dark.\n\n64 per cent of British adults admit they're still scared of the dark\n\nIt readies us for sleep by making us tired, but artificial light can interfere with its production \u2014 especially the blue light used by LEDs. (The red and yellow light emitted by incandescent bulbs is far more calming.)\n\nUnfortunately, LEDs dominate not only street lights and outdoor lighting, but also all the screens we use: iPads, computers, mobile phones.\n\nAs well as having a different temperature and shorter wavelength, blue light also has a different frequency. It flickers instead of flowing.\n\nSome people think that the temperature is the biggest problem; others believe it is the frequency. Whichever it is, studies show artificial light can have a negative effect on our health. There is a higher risk of morbid obesity, breast cancer, diabetes and depression. It can also cause early puberty.\n\nThe use of light for therapeutic purposes is old news, but the world is finally opening its eyes to the concept of dark therapy, too. We are discovering that orange glasses can block out blue light, ensuring that melatonin production doesn\u2019t stop despite all the artificial light we are exposed to.\n\nIn a study at Valen Hospital in Norway, researchers reported astonishing results on bipolar patients and people with sleep disorders. They\u2019d been trying to treat them for months with medication, but after only a week of wearing the glasses the patients greatly improved.\n\nIf they used them from 6pm, their manic hyperactivity disappeared and they slept better.\n\nThe Norwegian doctor who worked on this, Tone Elise Gjotterud Henriksen, thinks the glasses might help shift workers, adults with ADHD, young people who stay up gaming, those with postnatal depression and people working late.\n\nTone\u2019s husband and two sons, 13 and 15, put on their orange glasses two hours before bed to shut out blue light.\n\nThe book is being sold at \u00a312.99\n\nI now do the same and find I can sleep more easily; the brand I use is Melamedic (melamedic.dk) but they are widely available online. Tone thinks this is a return to the way things were before screens and LEDs.\n\n\u2018In an artificially lit existence, there is relatively little difference between night and day, and this has a negative impact on us,\u2019 she says. \u2018It\u2019s unnatural and can cause trouble in our bodies.\u2019\n\nIf, for example, you wake up and check your phone, it only takes a second for the blue light to reach the receptors in your eyes. These send a signal to the alarm centres in your brain, which wakes you up properly \u2014 stopping the secretion of the darkness hormone.\n\nIn Israel, research has shown that the amount of light you are exposed to at night is a contributing factor to breast cancer. It has been proven that nurses who work at night are at greater risk of it, too.\n\nTone says that there is too little research on psychiatric conditions, but darkness therapy has been very effective so far.\n\nShe and other researchers want to equip us with a new concept: light hygiene. Imagine what it would be like if everyone was a bit more conscious of their exposure to darkness and light.\n\nNot only could we save resources, we could also mitigate a lot of suffering.\n\nWe need to realise how much unnecessary artificial light we are surrounded by, and how much harm it\u2019s doing.\n\nI\u2019ve started introducing routines at home: all screens must be switched off at least an hour before bed. I\u2019ve bought an old alarm clock so my phone can stay switched off in the kitchen. I also avoid turning the lights on in the twilight \u2018blue hour\u2019, letting the darkness embrace me.\n\nAnd, whenever I can, I go out to look at the night sky. I try to see the Big Dipper, North Star and constellation Cassiopeia.\n\nThe universe is mankind\u2019s greatest mystery, and when we hide the night sky behind too much light we deprive ourselves of infinite knowledge.\n\nWe all need natural darkness. I\u2019m still afraid of the dark, but now I know darkness can be as kind as light.", "description": "Night shifts have been linked to strokes, heart attacks and some forms of cancer, writes authors Sigri Sandberg and Sian Mackie in their new book 'An Ode to Darkness'", "authors": ["Sigri Sandberg For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/00/19375364-0-image-a-5_1570405242953.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
