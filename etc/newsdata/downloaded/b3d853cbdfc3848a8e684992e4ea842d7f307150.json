Keith Wheeler, R-Oswego, sponsored a bill that would ban the practice.\n\nPreckwinkle sought $17 million from the Illinois Retail Merchants\u2019 Association for challenging the constitutionality of the tax and holding up collections for a month. The county eventually withdrew its retribution request against IRMA.\n\nWheeler says a government shouldn\u2019t be able to use the legal system to punish a citizen challenging its authority.\n\n\u201cA lot of people have given the ultimate sacrifice to ensure that our liberties are intact and this is one way to start taking them away,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can stop people from asking questions about a tax, you can stop them from asking about anything. That\u2019s a horrible precedent to set.\u201d\n\nPreckwinkle withdrew her lawsuit earlier this month after receiving criticism for filing it in the first place.\n\nThe penny-per-ounce tax adds $1.44 to the cost of a 12-pack of canned soda, or 68 cents to a 2-liter bottle. It also is imposed on fountain drinks.\n\nWheeler\u2019s bill is waiting a committee assignment in the state House.", "description": "Illinois lawmakers are pushing to keep governments from suing citizens .09/02/2019 3:01:55AM EST.", "authors": ["Watchdog News", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png"}
