(Ian Carbutt)\n\nPietermaritzburg - A 27-year-old man is on the run after police pounced on his home in Gezubuso, on the outskirts of Pietermaritzburg and found stolen cars and car parts.\n\nYesterday afternoon Taylor\u2019s Halt police received information about stolen cars being stripped at the house.\n\nPolice spokesperson Mthokozisi \u00adNgobese said, \u201cWhen the police got to the home of the suspect they found a Toyota Avanza which was reported stolen at the Umbilo police station and a Mazda 323 which had been stripped. It could not be identified because the engine number and serial number had been scratched out.\u201d\n\nAccording to a source, the suspect is a well-known man in the area.\n\n\u201cWe have never suspected anything because when asked about these cars, he would say they belonged to a friend,\u201d said the source.\n\n\u201cThe suspect is still on the run but we have arrested a 24-year-old woman for the possession of stolen goods,\u201d said Ngobese.\n\nThe woman told The Witness before she was arrested that she knew \u201cnothing about this\u201d.\n\n\u201cI only came here last week to visit [the suspect]. I am from Dambuza. It\u2019s the first time I have seen these items.\u201d\n\nAccording to a neighbour, the suspect has never given anyone a reason not to trust him.\n\n\u201cHe is a very good child. This came as a shock to everyone,\u201d said the neighbour.", "description": "A 27-year-old man is on the run after police pounced on his home in Gezubuso, on the outskirts of Pietermaritzburg and found stolen cars and car parts.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/1128/e2db12283fe24c3f97cbb2d9206f3aa0.jpg", "published_at": "2015-11-12"}
