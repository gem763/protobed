How could he have so blithely ignored the lessons of the nearly three-year investigation? But those who know him best say this is merely the latest episode in a lifelong pattern of behavior for the congenitally combative Trump. He\u2019s always been this way. He doesn\u2019t stop to reflect. If he wins, he barely basks. If he loses, he doesn\u2019t take the time to lie low or lick wounds; he invariably refuses to even admit that he lost. Regardless of the outcome\u2014up, down or somewhere in between\u2014when one tussle is done, Trump reflexively starts to scan the horizon in search of a new skirmish.\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s not in a fight, he looks for one,\u201d former Trump publicist Alan Marcus told me this weekend. \u201cHe can\u2019t stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always in an attack mode,\u201d former Trump casino executive Jack O\u2019Donnell said. \u201cHe\u2019s always got adversaries.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe does love a confrontation\u2014there\u2019s no question about it,\u201d added Barbara Res, a former Trump Organization executive. \u201cTrump thinks he\u2019s always going to win\u2014he really does believe that\u2014and he fights very, very, very dirty.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Michael Kruse", "Politico.Com Magazine Story"], "top_image": ""}
