David Wright made a couple of creaky appearances at third base with the Mets last year, just as Joe Mauer was winding down with the Twins. In all three cases, tributes were appropriate, because their careers in the only cities for which they played were coming to a close. October offered nothing but golf.\n\nAD\n\nZimmerman\u2019s case is different, because we don\u2019t know whether the last time we\u2019ll see him is Tuesday night in that wild-card game, or in the division series that follows, or later this autumn \u2014 or even next year, at a reduced rate. But he is tribute-worthy around here, and not just because he played his first game as a National a couple months before Alex Ovechkin played his first game as a Capital, pre-dating any athlete or coach or exec in Washington.\n\nHere are Zimmerman\u2019s totals, with ranks in Nats history: 1,687 games (first), 1,782 hits (first), 270 home runs (first), 1,014 RBI (first), 935 runs (first), 401 doubles (first), 630 walks (first). Think it\u2019s all a function of longevity? Well, extend the parameters back to 1969, the first year of the Montreal Expos. Zim drops to second in just three categories: games (behind Tim Wallach\u2019s 1,767), runs (Tim Raines, 947) and walks (Raines, 793).\n\nAD\n\nThe Nationals have been so good it\u2019s hard to figure out who to use in the NL wild-card game\n\nThat, folks, is the face of the franchise. Because he signed two extensions to stay \u2013 five years and $45 million in 2009, then the nine-digit doozy three years later that came with a no-trade clause \u2013 he has never entered an offseason not knowing where he would play. He is forever a foundational piece. Though he\u2019s not thinking about it right now \u2013 \u201cThe contractual stuff, that\u2019ll all take care of itself,\u201d he said \u2013 he has thought about it, and deeply. It has to start with the question: After 15 seasons, injuries to his shoulder and both his feet and his thumb and his hamstring and Lord knows what else, is the desire to play still there?\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think the desire to play here is there, for sure,\u201d Zimmerman said Thursday. \u201cEveryone\u2019s like, \u2018Would you play anywhere else? I\u2019ve never said, \u2018No.\u2019 I wouldn\u2019t say never.\n\n\u201cBut my kids are getting older. A lot of these guys, even when they\u2019re at \u2018home\u2019 \u2014 which is here \u2014 their kids and their family aren\u2019t here. So 81 games, at least I\u2019m actually at home with my wife and kids. So that\u2019s actually a huge factor. At the end of the day, I don\u2019t have to play anymore, either. So I\u2019ve got that going for me.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe laughed. Seems clear, doesn\u2019t it? He\u2019s either a Nat in 2020, or he\u2019s not playing at all.\n\nMan, for the first draft choice this franchise made in Washington \u2014 fourth overall in 2005, a third baseman out of the University of Virginia \u2014 the only player still in the majors who pulled on a Nationals uniform in that inaugural season, doesn\u2019t that seem appropriate?\n\nHe\u2019s the only Nat remaining who dressed in the dank home locker room at RFK Stadium, who endured all the losing that begat this run of five playoff appearances in eight seasons. I remember sitting on the bench in the home dugout at RFK one day in September 2005, the month the Nats called up Zimmerman as a 20-year-old. Nick Johnson, the former Nats first baseman, sat next to me.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHow about this kid?\u201d Johnson said, nodding toward Zimmerman on the field. \u201cSo poised.\u201d\n\nHe had to be. In his first five full seasons \u2014 2006 to 2010 \u2014 the Nats averaged 66 wins a year. Only Pittsburgh lost more games. Every night of his early 20s, Zimmerman had to answer questions about it all, because what other constant did the Nats have?\n\n\u201cI was so young then, I didn\u2019t even grasp it,\u201d Zimmerman said. \u201cThe first five years were just about not getting in the way and learning as much as you can. You\u2019re like a sponge.\u201d\n\nMore Svrluga: Playoff-clinching win was perfect bookend to the Bryce Harper chapter in Nationals history\n\nIt might be hard for the 2019 Nats fan to fathom this, what with the plantar fasciitis that has limited Zimmerman to 50 games, but he was a stud back then. He was runner-up to Florida shortstop Hanley Ramirez in the 2006 N.L. rookie of the year race that was so close, had one voter flipped Ramirez to second and Zimmerman to first on his or her ballot, they would have tied. In 2007, he played all 162 games. When Nationals Park opened in 2008, Zimmerman\u2019s image was on the back of the giant scoreboard in right-center field, welcoming people as they walked to the park \u2014 the only choice.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo in all those games, in 7,124 plate appearances as a Nat, he must have a few favorite memories.\n\n\u201cI think we had a lot of cool memories as an organization,\u201d Zimmerman said.\n\nHe\u2019s too in-the-moment. Fine. I\u2019ll pick mine.\n\nStart with Father\u2019s Day, 2006, when the New York Yankees played here for the first time since the old Senators days. The previous two nights, Yankees Manager Joe Torre had turned to his closer, Mariano Rivera, who nailed down one save and blew another. On the Sunday, that led Torre to stick with his starter, Chien-Ming Wang, to protect a 2-1 lead in the ninth. After a one-out single from Marlon Anderson, Zimmerman got a first-pitch sinker that stayed up. He drove it into the visiting bullpen at RFK, where 45,157 fans just lost it.\n\nThat day, it felt like baseball created a buzz in Washington. The Nats weren\u2019t any good, but Zimmerman represented some sort of hope for the future. Two years later, when the Nationals christened their new yard with a season-opening Sunday night game against Atlanta on ESPN, Zimmerman was chosen to accompany President George W. Bush for the ceremonial first pitch. And then, with the score tied in the ninth, Zimmerman drove Peter Moylan\u2019s sinker on a low line into both the Red Porch seats and the night.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of guys who are sick and tired of losing around here,\u201d Zimmerman said in the dugout interview on ESPN. And then they lost 102 games.\n\nThrough all that, he has 11 walk-off homers. Only one player has been part of the entirety \u2014 the losing, the winning, the old ballpark, the new, as a star and, now, as a sub.\n\nA year into a rebuild, the Orioles have been shaken up and (they hope) straightened out\n\nWhat next? What if this fall ended in something other than agony?\n\n\u201cYou win the World Series and just go home?\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I still feel like I would want to come back and have another year. I think my role is going to change drastically which, honestly, I would be okay with. I think a lot of guys push themselves out early because they\u2019re not willing to take a lesser role or maybe take a little less money.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s how this lifelong marriage could be extended, at least on the field. Zimmerman insists his body feels terrific, and he looks strong. Since he returned from the injured list Sept. 1, his on-base-plus-slugging percentage is .819 \u2014 right at his career mark of .818. Sharing first base in 2020 with a left-handed hitter \u2014 a la Matt Adams \u2014 could make sense. Whenever he has been asked whether he would want Zimmerman back, General Manager Mike Rizzo has said, \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re paying someone $18 million to [play part-time], it stings a little bit,\u201d Zimmerman said. \u201cBut whatever the number, it could work. Rizz knows what I think. There\u2019s no reason to talk about it now. That\u2019s the least of my worries.\u201d\n\nHe and his wife Heather are raising their daughters, 5-year-old Mackenzie and 3-year-old Hayden, in Great Falls. His contract calls for the Nats to pay him $2 million annually for five years after his retirement, deferred money from when he signed. \u201cI\u2019ve made more than I could ever use,\u201d he said. Whenever his career is over \u2014 Tuesday night, next year, the year after \u2014 he will find a new interest.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about finding something that drives you, something that kind of gives you a purpose,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause we\u2019re competitors.\u201d\n\nRyan Zimmerman will compete again this weekend, and then Tuesday night. Beyond that, who knows? So as you steel yourself for all the angst and action the wild-card game will bring, take a moment when he comes to the plate. Stand and clap. Tip your cap. Remember what he meant here for 15 years, even as we can\u2019t be sure about what\u2019s to come.\n\nRead more Nationals coverage from Post Sports:\n\nStephen Strasburg makes one final case for a chance to start the NL wild-card game\n\nBryce Harper\u2019s wife says \u2018classless\u2019 Nats Park fan yelled about newborn son\n\nHow Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera evolved to become the utility player the Nationals need", "description": "Washington\u2019s first baseman was a third baseman when he played his first game in DC a couple months before Alex Ovechkin made his Capitals debut.", "authors": ["Barry Svrluga", "Sports Columnist With Beat Writing Experience On Baseball", "Golf", "The Nfl", "College Basketball", "College Football", "Sports Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/vdN_jtEcsPkHLUblI_tV_wHuMKY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/V7R4WAGPLYI6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
