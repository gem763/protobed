(AP) - Tampa Bay\u2019s kicking woes cost the Buccaneers another game.\n\nRookie Matt Gay\u2019s 34-yard field goal attempt sailed right wide as time expired Sunday, leaving the Bucs on the short end of a 32-31 loss to the New York Giants. The sixth-round draft pick also missed an extra point and had another blocked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to make that every single time,\u201d said Gay, who placed the blame on himself even though Tampa Bay\u2019s defense allowed Giants rookie quarterback Daniel Jones to lead four long touchdown drives - 75, 75, 80 and 75 yards - in his first start for New York.\n\n\u201cI had some good warmup kicks on the side, kicking into the net. I was super confident going on the field. I felt really good about it,\u201d Gay said. \u201cI went out there, still felt really good and took my steps, went through my whole process, got back there, had my line, and just didn\u2019t hit it clean.\u201d\n\nFinding a reliable kicker has been a challenge for the Bucs, who drafted Roberto Aguayo in the second round in 2016 only see him struggle as a rookie and eventually released in training camp the following year.\n\nGay\u2019s strong leg makes the Bucs a threat to score any time they cross an opponent\u2019s 40-yard line. He was drafted this year to compete with incumbent Cairo Santos in training camp. He excelled on long kicks in practice and during the preseason, but was not nearly as consistent on shorter kicks.\n\nJameis Winston moved the Bucs into position to attempt the possible game winner with a 44-yard completion to Mike Evans at the Giants 9. The Bucs deliberately took a delay of game penalty, then had Winston run to the middle of the field before taking a knee to center the ball at the 16.\n\nArians defended taking the penalty, saying the extra yardage didn\u2019t matter.\n\n\u201cThat field goal is easier back 5 yards, no sense hurrying,\u201d coach Bruce Arians said. \u201cWe wanted to move the ball over, put it in the middle and make it an easy field goal.\u201d\n\nWinston said it never should have come down to a kick at the end.\n\nThe Bucs scored on all six of their offensive possessions in the first half - three touchdowns and three field goals - to build a 28-10 lead. The Giants began their comeback with Evan Engram\u2019s 75-yard TD reception on the first play of the second half.\n\n\u201cWe just have to play better football and we\u2019ve got to finish,\u201d Winston said.\n\n\u201cI told (Gay) keep grinding - keep digging in. We\u2019ve all got to do our part,\u201d the quarterback added. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have put him in that situation. He\u2019s going to have another chance, and he\u2019s going to make more game-winning field goals.\u201d\n\nGay appreciated the support.\n\n\u201cMy team\u2019s been really good, just making sure I keep my head up and that I\u2019ve got to put it behind me and that going forward, it\u2019s not going to help to look back on this one,\u201d the kicker said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to live and learn from what I did. \u2026 It doesn\u2019t take away from the fact that I\u2019ve got to make that field goal, though.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Tampa Bay's kicking woes cost the Buccaneers another game.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Fred Goodall"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/22/giants_buccaneers_football_91943_c0-11-4454-2607_s1770x1032.jpg?15c90453d9a9e830618453b0b1ea52c7d3d078a4", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
