During the summer months, it had previously moved at a rate only occasionally exceeding 30cm a day.\n\n\"These phenomena show once more how the mountain is experiencing a period of great changes due to climate factors, so it is especially vulnerable,\" Mr. Miserocchi said.\n\nHe said there was no immediate risks to residential areas.\n\nRead more: Greta Thunberg and 15 other kids have filed a legal complaint against 5 countries, joining a growing group of young people bringing the climate fight to court\n\nThe warning prompted Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte to mention the increased risks the climate crisis poses during an address at the UN General Assembly on Wednesday.\n\n\"News that a glacier on Mont Blanc risks collapsing is a warning that can't leave us indifferent, it must shake us up and we have to mobilize,\" he said.\n\nThere's no warning system in place to warn of a collapse\n\nBut experts have said there is no way of knowing exactly when the glacier will collapse, and there is currently no warning system in place.\n\nItaly's Fondazione Montagna Sicura (Safe Mountain Foundation) wrote on Facebook: \"From 19.30 pm today, the municipal road of Val Ferret will be closed \u2013 between the locations Montitaz and Planpinceux \u2013 and the road road for the location location for the potential glacial risk linked to the glacier of Planpinceux.\"\n\nAcross the Alps there is concern warmer temperatures are increasing the danger of melting permafrost and disappearing glaciers.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organisation warned in a new report released this week that if average temperatures continue to rise at current levels, the ice in the eastern and central areas of the Alps could disappear completely within two or three decades. Year round glaciers would remain only in the western Alps, which are the tallest part of the mountain range.\n\nAdditional reporting by Reuters.", "description": "A glacier located on Mont Blanc in Italy is at risk of melting and collapsing, leading to closing roads and evacuations.", "authors": ["Harry Cockburn", "The Independent"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8b81692e22af34a247e119?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
