They like playing good football, but I was so happy to play against them, because I knew I was going to win.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nThough Arsenal have lost four of their last seven away matches against newly-promoted teams, Xhaka played down claims that the side have a mentality issue when playing on the road.\n\n\u2018We have to stop talking about [the mental side of the game] and bulls*** like this,\u2019 the Arsenal captain said.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m sorry to say that, but for me it\u2019s the same whether you play at home or away.\n\n\u2018You have to win and show big character and not look for the same excuse.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsked specifically about Evra\u2019s comments, Xhaka replied: \u2018A lot of people speak too much.\n\n\u2018I have a lot of respect for him because he was a great player, but you have to be careful what you say.\n\n\u2018He knows what these situations well, but it\u2019s not only him. A lot of people speak a lot of bulls*** and it\u2019s always the same.\n\n\u2018For me it\u2019s strange because they [ex-footballers] have been in the same situation as us \u2013 maybe it was sometimes good, sometimes not so good.\n\n\u2018But like I said, if you speak bulls*** like this every weekend, then what they say doesn\u2019t get respected.\u2019\n\nMORE: Ian Wright reacts to Nicolas Pepe missing sitter and fumes at Unai Emery after Arsenal defeat", "description": "Granit Xhaka has hit back at Patrice Evra's 'bulls***' claims after the Frenchman referred to Arsenal players as 'my babies' in the wake of their 1-0 defeat at Sheffield United....", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GRANITT-369d_1571749004.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
