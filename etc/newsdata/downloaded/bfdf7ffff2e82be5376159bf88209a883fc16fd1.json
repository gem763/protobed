He fatally shot a woman outside the synagogue and a man inside a nearby kebab shop.\n\nTwo other people were seriously injured, but regional broadcaster MDR said their condition was not critical.\n\nPolice said they had detained one person, reported by German magazines Spiegel and Focus Online to be a 27-year-old German named Stephan B. His full name cannot be published under German privacy laws.\n\nVideo broadcast on Amazon\u2019s (AMZN.O) gaming subsidiary Twitch showed a young man with a shaven head first reciting a short statement in broken English while sitting in a parked car.\n\n\u201cI think the Holocaust never happened,\u201d he began, before adding \u201cfeminism is the cause of decline in birth rates in the West\u201d and mentioning mass immigration. He concluded: \u201cThe root of all these problems is the Jew\u201d, before embarking on his shooting spree.\n\nA spokeswoman for Amazon said Twitch \u201cworked with urgency to remove this content and will permanently suspend any accounts found to be posting or reposting content of this abhorrent act.\u201d\n\nIn the video, the man drove to the synagogue, found the gates shut and unsuccessfully sought to force the gates open. He then shot several rounds at a woman passerby.\n\n\u201cWe saw via the camera system at our synagogue that a heavily armed perpetrator with a steel helmet and a gun tried to shoot open our doors,\u201d Max Privorozki, Halle\u2019s Jewish community chairman, told the Stuttgarter Zeitung newspaper.\n\n\u201cWe barricaded the doors from inside and waited for the police,\u201d he said, adding that about 70 to 80 people were inside the synagogue observing Yom Kippur, known as the Day of Atonement which is marked by fasting and solemn prayer.\n\nPolice officers are seen at the site of a shooting, in which two people were killed, in Halle, Germany October 9, 2019.

Merkel\u2019s spokesman tweeted: \u201cWe must oppose any form of anti-Semitism.\u201d\n\n\u2018CALM, LIKE A PROFESSIONAL\u2019\n\nRifat Tekin, who worked at the Halle kebab outlet, said he was making a kebab for two construction workers when a perpetrator threw an explosive at the restaurant before shooting.\n\n\u201cHe was very calm, like a professional,\u201d Tekin told n-tv television. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say anything. He just kept coming and shooting ... I was hiding behind the salad counter.\u201d\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent condolences to the victims\u2019 families and said in a Twitter post: \u201cThe terrorist attack against the community in Halle in Germany on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of our nation, is yet another expression that anti-Semitism is growing in Europe.\u201d\n\n\u201cI call upon the authorities in Germany to continue to work determinedly against the phenomenon of anti-Semitism.\u201d\n\nAnti-semitism is a particularly sensitive issue in Germany, which during World War Two was responsible for the genocide of 6 million Jews in the Nazi Holocaust. Around 200,000 Jews live today in the country of around 83 million people.\n\nInterior Minister Horst Seehofer said the shooting was anti-Semitic, adding: \u201cAccording to the federal prosecutors\u2019 office, there are enough indications that it was possibly a right-wing extremist motive.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nDespite comprehensive de-Nazification in the post-war era, fears of resurgent anti-Semitic hatred have never completely gone away, whether from fringe, far-right neo-Nazis or more recently from Muslim immigrants.\n\nOccasional past attacks have ranged from the scrawling of Nazi swastikas on gravestones to firebombings at synagogues and even several murders. In recent years, cases of assault or verbal abuse, in some cases directed against people wearing traditional Jewish skullcaps, have raised an outcry.", "description": "A gunman who denounced Jews opened fire outside a German synagogue on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish year, and killed two people as he livestreamed his attack.", "authors": ["Thomas Escritt", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438994904&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF981AQ", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
