Bush at Cowboys Game", "language": "en", "text": "In a clip that will air as part of her daytime talk show on Tuesday, Ellen DeGeneres addressed the backlash she received over the weekend when cameras caught her sharing a laugh with former President George W. Bush in the owner\u2019s box at the Dallas Cowboys game.\n\nAs the comedian explained, she and her wife Portia de Rossi were invited to the game by Charlotte Jones, the daughter of Trump-supporting Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, and ended up seated in the luxury box next to the former president and his wife Laura Bush.\n\n\u201cWhen we were invited, I was aware that I was going to be surrounded by people with very different views and beliefs,\u201d DeGeneres said, before joking that it was not because of \u201cpolitics\u201d but because she was rooting for the Green Bay Packers.\n\n\u201cDuring the game, they showed a shot of George and me laughing together,\u201d she continued, putting a still of the moment on screen beside her. \u201cAnd people were upset. They thought, why is a gay Hollywood liberal sitting next to a conservative Republican president? Didn\u2019t even notice I\u2019m holding the brand new iPhone 11.\u201d\n\nDeGeneres said she knew \u201ca lot of people were mad\u201d because \u201cthey did what people do when they\u2019re mad: they tweet.\u201d Instead of addressing any of their specific criticisms\u2014including one from actor John Cusack that simply read, \u201c fuck normalizing mass murderers\u201d\u2014 the host highlighted one tweet that read, \u201cEllen and George Bush together makes me have faith in America again.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the thing: I\u2019m friends with George Bush, and in fact, I\u2019m friends with a lot of people who don\u2019t share the same beliefs that I have,\u201d DeGeneres said, comparing it to \u201cbeing friends with people who wear fur\u201d even though she doesn\u2019t believe in wearing fur. \u201cJust because I don\u2019t agree with someone on everything doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not going to be friends with them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I say, \u2018Be kind to one another,\u2019 I don\u2019t just mean the people who think the same way that you do,\u201d she said, referring to her well-known mantra. \u201cI mean be kind to everyone.\u201d", "description": "The talk-show host received blowback online for appearing on screen next to the former Republican president.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1439,w_2558,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570508301/Ellen_1_lxwezn", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
