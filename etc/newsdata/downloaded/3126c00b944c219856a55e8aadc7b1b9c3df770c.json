She said that while she was pushing for a \"stronger\" deal, that it was better than no deal.\n\n\"I think there are some flaws right now with it. But ultimately, when it came down to it, that nuclear agreement prevented war. And that's the danger of what the Trump administration is doing right now, pushing us closer and closer to war with Iran by ripping up that deal,\" Gabbard said.\n\nTensions between the U.S. and Iran have escalated in recent months. In June, Iran shot down a U.S. drone. Mr. Trump had approved a strike on Iran, but he said he backed off after learning how many lives could be lost. Instead, the Pentagon went ahead with a cyber attack.\n\nMr. Trump also signed new sanctions against Iran at the end of June, and the Department of Defense has sent thousands of troops to the region.\n\n\"Deploying U.S. troops to the region, they basically set the dynamite fuse and lit it, for another war that will be far more devastating [than what] we saw throughout Iraq, the war that I served in,\" said Gabbard, who served in Iraq as a member of the Hawaii National Guard.\n\nGabbard also said that the U.S. would rejoin the United Nations Human Rights Council if she became president, saying that the U.S. needs to be a \"force for good\" in the world. Gabbard's controversial foreign policy has faced a lot of scrutiny, and she has been heavily criticized for going to Syria and meeting with dictator Bashar al-Assad.", "description": "Gabbard also said that she believed the U.S. should rejoin the UN Human Rights Council", "authors": ["Grace Segers", "Grace Segers Is A Politics Reporter For Cbs News Digital.", "Nicole Sganga"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/01/26/7c01a638-bd41-4d54-a839-dd6b71f9d7be/thumbnail/1200x630/29cf9380e808cbbfaa563cb9caddf8f6/ap-653718579809.jpg"}
