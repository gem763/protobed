That is the simplest conclusion to draw from Eliud Kipchoge\u2019s incredible feat in Vienna in the early hours of Saturday morning, when the Kenyan became the first man to break a barrier that for so long had been deemed impossible.\n\nAnd irrespective of anything else, it truly was astonishing. It was certainly captivating. It was, perhaps, superhuman. His finishing time of one hour, 59 minutes and 40 seconds will be remembered forever and he deserves every accolade that will be bestowed upon him.\n\nYet for all the undoubted brilliance of the greatest marathon runner in history\u2019s accomplishment, this was also a feat of technology. For many, it was not sport but a science experiment conducted by people with self-serving interests, despite the stated tag line of wanting to prove \u201cNo Human Is Limited\u201d.\n\nThe chemical company Ineos had spent a reported \u00a315 million on this event and every element was conducted with impressive military precision. From the relaid road cutting through the Prater park to the bright green grid projected by laser from the pacing car and ensuring a near-perfect even speed; from the flawless mid-run changeovers in pacemaker personnel to every steward being equipped with a broom to sweep away any falling leaves. Nothing - absolutely nothing - was left to chance.", "description": "We have proof:", "authors": ["Ben Bloom", "Athletics Correspondent", "Oliver Brown"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/athletics/2019/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000212797525-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqcM9aBJczjGu2JtrWg8AaNebpMG9uWgcnc3MvHmUFhjA.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
