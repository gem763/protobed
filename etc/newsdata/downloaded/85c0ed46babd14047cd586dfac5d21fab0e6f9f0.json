The V \u2013 which many inside New Zealand took to stand for \u201cvictory\u201d \u2013 was widely praised by New Zealanders, many of whom commented on the dignified and low-key response of the English side to what can be a confronting and emotional experience.\n\nNumerous haka experts in New Zealand have attested that England\u2019s move to confront the haka was in no way offensive to the All Blacks side, and did not violate M\u0101ori cultural protocol, known as tikanga.\n\nThe All Blacks themselves dismissed the significance of the incident at the time, with their scrum-half Aaron Smith also revealing English captain Owen Farrell was winking at him during the performance.\n\nEngland\u2019s response to the haka should be encouraged, not penalised | Liam Napier Read more\n\nHowever, World Rugby regulations state opponents must not cross the halfway line while the Maori war dance is being performed and six England players could be seen in breach of that rule.\n\nIt is believed England have been fined a four-figure sum but less than the \u00a32,500 France had to pay when they adopted a similar formation before the 2011 World Cup final. On that occasion, almost all of the squad advanced beyond the halfway line.\n\nTapeta Wehi, a haka expert from Rotorua in the North Island, praised the English side\u2019s bold move and said he wished more teams would respond to the haka with such panache.\n\nWehi said the haka was widely misunderstood and was intended as a challenge to the opponents \u2013 and any side that met the challenge deserved respect \u2013 not a fine. \u201cA haka is laying down the challenge and they were challenging the All Blacks back \u2013 so no problem with that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a regulation problem about whether they were allowed to cross that line but that\u2019s got nothing to do with our culture. Whatever England did, that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. The Irish did it too, that was great. For me it\u2019s all good, no problem at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost M\u0101ori love it when the challenge is met \u2013 I love it,\u201d said Wehi. \u201cPeople have to understand more what the haka is about. People think what they are doing is disrespectful. But if you ask M\u0101ori, they\u2019ll tell you that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. It\u2019s laying a challenge and if the other team want to challenge you back \u2013 then it\u2019s all good. That\u2019s what it is all about.\u201d\n\nOther haka and tikanga M\u0101ori cultural experts have echoed Wehi\u2019s sentiments.\n\nOn Thursday many New Zealanders expressed their disappointment in the fine issued to England, saying it was nit-picking and unfair, with one senior New Zealand Herald editor slamming it as \u201cutterly ridiculous\u201d.\n\nMiriyana Alexander (@miriyananz) Utterly ridiculous.
