Ator died when officers intercepted him outside a movie theater.\n\nTwo victims died overnight Saturday, officials confirmed, raising the death toll to seven. Twenty-two others were injured, according to law enforcement. Those killed ranged in age from 15 to 57.\n\nA local student was killed in the attacks, the Ector County school district wrote on Facebook . A 17-month-old girl was among the wounded. Three law-enforcement officers were shot: a Texas Department of Public Safety trooper, an Odessa police officer and a Midland police officer, officials said.\n\nIn a news conference Sunday, officials praised local law enforcement for stopping the shooter, speculating that he may have been heading into the Cinergy movie theater when he was killed.\n\n\u201cWhy would you go to a theater if you\u2019re not planning on going into the theater?\u201d Police Chief Michael Gerke said, adding that the movie theater is one of the most crowded places in Odessa on a Saturday.\n\nFBI Special Agent Christopher Combs said hundreds of federal personnel are on the ground, from the FBI and other agencies. He confirmed federal authorities were executing a search warrant on a home on the western side of the city and said, with over 15 crime scenes, locals should expect to see FBI activity.\n\nMr. Turner said there is no indication that the shooter had any particular ideology. \u201cI think it\u2019s just someone with some problems,\u201d he said. Law-enforcement officials Sunday said they didn\u2019t suspect that Ator had ties to domestic or international terror groups.\n\nMr. Turner added that the rampage hit the city hard.\n\nThe shooter was killed by the police after opening fire in Midland and Odessa PHOTO: MARK ROGERS/ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\u201cThe city is hurting,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re already starting to see the politicization of what happened, but right now, we\u2019re coming together as a city. The outpouring of prayer and support has been amazing, from blood, to food, to water, to taking care of our first responders. Today begins the healing process.\u201d\n\nThe shooting began at around 3:15 p.m. local time Saturday when the DPS trooper attempted to stop a gold sedan for failing to signal.\n\nBefore the vehicle came to a stop, the suspect pointed a rifle toward the rear window of his car and fired several shots toward the DPS patrol unit, hitting a trooper, according to a statement from the DPS.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS How should officials respond to this latest shooting incident? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe suspect then drove into Odessa, where he began targeting people at random. At some point, the suspect ditched his car, stole a U.S. mail truck and continued shooting people. Officers ultimately shot the suspect, Chief Gerke said. He was killed at the Cinergy movie theater in Odessa.\n\nThe trooper is in serious but stable condition, and the two other officers are in stable condition at a local hospital, according to the DPS statement.\n\nThe 17-month-old girl was sent to University Medical Center in Lubbock, where she was in satisfactory condition Saturday night, said Eric Finley, marketing director at UMC Health System. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said Sunday that the girl was slated to have surgery Monday.\n\nThe shooting comes less than a month after mass shootings in Texas and Ohio left at least 31 dead and about 50 injured in the space of 24 hours. Twenty-two of the dead were killed by a gunman in an El Paso Walmart .\n\nOn Sunday, Gov. Abbott recounted the string of mass shootings he has seen during his tenure in Texas, saying \u201cthe status quo in the state of Texas is not acceptable.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have been to too many of these events as governor,\u201d he said. \u201cI am heartbroken by the crying of the people of the state of Texas. I\u2019m tired of the dying of the people of the state of Texas.\u201d\n\nGov. Abbott said he and other lawmakers are meeting daily to discuss possible solutions to such shootings. He said this most recent rampage \u201cabsolutely\u201d gives greater urgency to that effort.\n\nStill, he defended 15 new laws that went into effect Sunday, largely loosening restrictions on guns. He said some of them, including a provision making it easier to arm officers at schools, aim to make communities safer.\n\nFriends of Leila Hernandez, one of the victims of the Saturday shooting in Odessa, gather at a memorial service on Sunday.

Mr. Trump said better background checks \u201cwould not have stopped\u201d many recent mass shootings.\n\nThe shootings in Texas \u201creally hasn\u2019t changed anything\u201d in terms of the policy options being considered, he said.\n\nDuring a briefing on Hurricane Dorian Sunday afternoon, Mr. Trump called for \u201cstrong measures to keep weapons out of the hands of dangerous and deranged individuals and substantial reforms to the nation\u2019s broken mental health system.\u201d He also said it is his goal to identify \u201cseverely disturbed individuals\u201d and stop them before they can harm the public.\n\nTrump administration officials have been meeting with lawmakers and congressional staffers since mass shootings in Ohio and Texas last month left 31 dead. But it remains unclear whether there is enough political will in Congress to move gun control legislation.\n\nActing Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan said Sunday the shootings across the nation are \u201cabsolutely a homeland security threat\u201d and that what he called domestic terrorism has taken a \u201cfrontline focus\u201d within the department\u2019s counterterrorism strategy and approach.\n\nSen. Rick Scott (R., Fla.), speaking on \u201cNBC\u2019s Meet the Press,\u201d said Sunday Congress should focus on the kind of legislation Florida passed after the Parkland, Fla., shooting more than a year ago, which he supported, that helped to identify individuals who exhibit troubling behavior.\n\nA \u201cred-flag law\u201d gives law enforcement and courts the authority to potentially seize all weapons from anyone who has threatened to harm themselves or someone else, he said. Florida legislators also added a provision that will provide law-enforcement officers to each school and more mental-health counselors to help identify problems before they happen, he said.\n\nMr. Scott stopped short of saying he would support an assault-weapons ban or other measures that would remove weapons from the streets.\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic presidential candidates pressed for tighter gun laws. Former Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, a Texan, told MSNBC that stricter gun controls should be in place, as well as higher taxes on firearms and ammunition.\n\n\u201cThis, just three weeks after what we saw in El Paso, is tremendously heartbreaking for the entire nation but, of course, especially for those of us in Texas,\u201d he said. \u201cHow many of these incidents do we have to see before we understand that we have to take action?\u201d\n\nThe League of United Latin American Citizens asked the governor Saturday to call a special legislative session on guns. The Texas legislature meets every other year for five months, and isn\u2019t set to convene until 2021.\n\n\u2014Ken Thomas, Andrew Restuccia, Sadie Gurman and Dan Frosch contributed to this article.", "description": "The death toll from a shooting rampage in West Texas rose to seven as officials identified the gunman, but remained unsure about his motive.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Findell"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103227/social"}
