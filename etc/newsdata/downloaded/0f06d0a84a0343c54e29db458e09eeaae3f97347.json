He said he would respect the law but went on to hint at the possibility of another prorogation to allow a Queen\u2019s speech.\n\nPlay Video 1:34 Boris Johnson: supreme court ruling has made getting Brexit deal harder \u2013 video\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the justices remotely excluded the possibility of having a Queen\u2019s speech but what we will certainly do is ensure parliament has plenty of time to debate Brexit,\u201d he said.\n\nCorbyn, who brought forward his Labour conference speech by 24 hours to Tuesday afternoon in order to return to parliament on Wednesday, led calls for the prime minister to consider his position.\n\n\u201cIt demonstrates a contempt for democracy and an abuse of power by him,\u201d he told conference delegates in Brighton. \u201cI will be in touch immediately to demand that parliament is recalled so that we can question the prime minister, demand that he obeys the law that has been passed by parliament, and recognise that our parliament is elected by our people to hold our government to account.\n\n\u201cI invite Boris Johnson, in the historic words, to consider his position and become the shortest-serving prime minister there\u2019s ever been.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 2:30 Supreme court ruling shows Boris Johnson's contempt for democracy, says Corbyn \u2013 video\n\nNicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, said Johnson should resign and called for a no-confidence vote in his leadership if he refuses to do so.\n\nShe told Sky News: \u201cIf the rules of democracy are to mean anything then I think a prime minister with any honour would tender his resignation today \u2026 If the prime minister isn\u2019t prepared to do the decent and honourable thing then I think parliament should quickly come together to force this prime minister from office.\u201d\n\nJo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, said: \u201cThis confirms what we already knew \u2013 Boris Johnson isn\u2019t fit to be prime minister. He\u2019s misled Queen and country, and unlawfully silenced the people\u2019s representatives. I\u2019m on my way to resume my duties in the Commons and stop Brexit altogether.\u201d\n\nTimeline The plan to prorogue parliament and the court cases against it Show Hide\n\nThe story breaks The Observer breaks the story that Boris Johnson has sought legal advice on closing parliament for five weeks Leaks spread Other media organisations begin to receive leaks that Johnson will make a statement on prorogation Visit to Balmoral Three privy counsellors, including Jacob Rees-Mogg, travel to Balmoral to tell the Queen of the prorogation plan. Cabinet ministers are informed by conference call Protests and protestations Tens of thousands protest against prorogation. Cross-party group of MPs steps up preparation for blocking no deal when parliament makes a brief return Parliament returns Parliament returns and the prime minister loses six votes in six days. MPs vote to prevent a no-deal Brexit, and refuse Johnson's attempts to force them into a general election. Gina Miller case fails Legal campaigner Gina Miller vows to continue her \u201cfight for democracy\u201d after the high court dismissed her claim that the prime minister acted unlawfully in giving advice to the Queen to suspend parliament at a time of momentous political upheaval. Parliament dissolved Parliament is dissolved amid chaotic scenes as some MPs hold up signs saying they have been silenced, try to prevent Speaker John Bercow leaving the chamber, and sing the Red Flag. Scottish court ruling The court of session in Scotland rules that Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks was unlawful. The case will go to the supreme court. Supreme court hearing The Supreme court begins three-day hearing to join together all the appeals and legal challenges to the prorogation. Supreme court finds prorogation was unlawful The judges unanimously decided that prorogation was justiciable, and it was in the power of the court to rule on it. They additionally found that the prorogation was unlawful, as it had the effect of preventing parliament from being able to carry out its constitutional functions. The court found that the prime minister\u2019s advice to the Queen was unlawful, void and of no effect. Their unanimous judgement was that parliament had not been prorogued. Parliament is due to go back to work.\n\nCondemnation also came from Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, who stopped short of calling for Johnson to resign but urged the prime minister to sack Dominic Cummings, his most senior aide who is thought to have been behind the prorogation plan. \u201cThe calling of a Queen\u2019s speech and prorogation is the worst political decision ever. Dominic Cummings must go,\u201d he said.\n\nIn New York, where the verdict was delivered at 5.30am, the prime minister and his aides had a series of instant and tricky decisions to make.\n\nOfficials with Johnson had said it would take time to digest what they called an \u201cextraordinary\u201d ruling and provide a response, and there was no indication when or how this would come.\n\nThe prime minister was scheduled to make what had been billed as the major Brexit-related speech of his two-day trip at about 8am (1pm BST), telling US business leaders and investors about how the country would change after departure.\n\nJohnson was expected to have a series of bilateral talks, including with President Donald Trump and Ireland\u2019s Leo Varadkar, and to make his speech to the general assembly.\n\nJohnson and his team face a difficult decision on whether to keep to this agenda, or to head to London. One option could be to take the prime ministerial plane back to London late on Tuesday rather than, as planned, first thing on Wednesday.\n\nIf the current schedule is maintained, Johnson would not be back in No 10 until late Wednesday night \u2013 a long delay amid calls for his resignation. Speaking to reporters on the flight over, Johnson had said he would not resign if the case went against him.\n\nConservative MPs were largely silent on the issue but Rory Stewart, who lost the whip over Brexit last month, called for a new cross-party effort to pass a Brexit deal.", "description": "Speaker says Commons will reconvene on Wednesday amid calls for Boris Johnson to resign", "authors": ["Rowena Mason", "Peter Walker", "Martin Kettle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c488ed94989922a404e5a4eed06f3f6992168bda/0_288_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1557dc1888d082c80b50e1c31306260b", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
