Why would there be? Except the president\u2019s detractors don\u2019t consider Barr\u2019s investigation above-board, in fact consider it another form of Trump\u2019s perfidy.\n\nIn its report on Trump\u2019s call with the Australian prime minister, the New York Times says\u2014in a news report, mind you\u2014that the call \u201cshows the president using high-level diplomacy to advance his personal political interests.\u201d Trump is pleased with Barr\u2019s investigation, and would be even more pleased if it unearthed anything untoward. That doesn\u2019t make it merely a pet political project, or mean that there isn\u2019t a genuine public interest in knowing in greater detail how and why the Russia story got started.\n\nThe Times of London reported of Trump\u2019s call to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson that he wanted \u201cto gather evidence to undermine the investigation into his campaign\u2019s links to Russia.\u201d There\u2019s not really anything to undermine, though, since the investigation has been over for months.\n\nTrump is basically being accused of the entirely new offense of obstruction after the fact. There were many novel theories of obstruction advanced during the Mueller probe, but this is the most creative.\n\nThe Russia investigation figures into the Ukraine story in another way. It\u2019s not clear that even Democrats would consider his Ukraine call impeachable if it weren\u2019t for their belief that Trump has gotten away with so much previously, as cataloged in the Mueller report. There was already significant backing in the House for impeachment prior to the news of the Ukraine whistleblower complaint, and Judiciary Chair Jerry Nadler already said he was conducting an impeachment inquiry.\n\nEven the framework of the Ukraine matter reflects the Russia story. Trump\u2019s critics say he was asking for Ukrainian \u201cinterference\u201d in our elections, when what was really going on was that he and Rudy Giuliani were interfering in Ukrainian politics. They were pushing the Ukrainians to undertake investigations, including, of course, into Joe Biden\u2019s actions in the country.\n\nIf you accept the premise that any information developed in a foreign country and used in American politics is election interference, then Trump\u2019s opponents themselves were masters at leveraging Ukrainian interference during the 2016 election. As POLITICO reported in 2017, Ukrainian government officials \u201chelped Clinton\u2019s allies research damaging information on Trump and his advisers.\u201d\n\nGiuliani\u2019s Ukraine adventure was motivated, in large part, by the desire to get to the bottom of this activity in 2016, and turn the tables on Trump\u2019s critics. (Instead, he appears to have turned the tables on himself.)\n\nThere will be lots of comparisons with the 1990s as the House moves toward impeachment. Yet, the 1790s might be the more apt comparison. Back then, at the outset of the republic, each nascent political party was consumed with the idea that the other was a tool of a foreign power (either France or Britain), and believed that the other was a fundamental threat to American democracy. It made for particularly vitriolic politics.\n\nToday, the Democrats still have not gotten beyond the idea that Trump is somehow a a tool of Russia, while Republicans point to Democratic coordination with shadowy foreign forces to get the Russia investigation rolling. Books fly off the shelves about Trump being an alleged fascist, and Republicans are gripped by a Flight 93 mentality that fears if they lose a presidential election, they will never win another one again.\n\nThe Russian story contributed to and fed off this feverish atmosphere. For the longest time, it offered Democrats the hope of deliverance from a president whose election they never truly accepted. When Mueller didn\u2019t have the goods, House Democrats were at sea for a while, until Trump\u2019s call and the whistleblower complaint brought impeachment deliciously back into play.\n\nUkraine is more an epilogue of the Russian investigation than the beginning of a new book.\n\n", "description": "Ukraine is more an epilogue of the Russian investigation than the beginning of a new book.", "authors": ["Rich Lowry"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/38/83/bf8ad0a646e893ebf53731f19c3c/191002-trump-press-conference-getty-773.jpg"}
