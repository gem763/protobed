In 2019, more than 700,000 self-employed workers missed the January 31 tax deadline due to a lack of knowledge and support. This picture is likely to get worse.\n\nIn April next year, changes to the IR35 rules will directly impact a large proportion of freelancers and many are still confused about what they will need to do (if they\u2019ve even heard of it).\n\nThis will add complexity and intricacy to a sector already waylaid by administrative burden.\n\nIn the UK, admin tasks cost freelancers more than \u00a328billion a year. I believe that freelancers need better access to education, more support, and better infrastructure.\n\nWhile, in an ideal world, this wold come from the government, I believe private companies will lead the way due to their ability to act fast and be as agile as the workforce itself.\n\nAnother area where freelancers lack sufficient protection and remedy is around getting paid. From speaking to and working with countless freelancers, I know this is a constant cause of stress and anxiety which particularly impacts the creative sector.\n\nAccording to research conducted earlier this year, virtually half (48 per cent) of those working in the creative industries are regularly paid late, while previous research from IPSE has found that freelancers spend an average of 20 days a year chasing invoices for late payment.\n\nYoung people choosing this type of employment are often exploited, with almost half having completed work they were never paid for. The FSB estimates late payments alone cost the UK economy \u00a32.5billion a year.\n\nOne of the problems is that the infrastructure around payments is outdated \u2013 we need more automation and reduced fees on electronic payments so that companies and freelancers can feel confident when it comes to payment and human error can be taken out of the equation.\n\nAlbert's essentials to getting life sorted as a freelancer \u00b7 Speak to peers in the freelance world: Do you know any other freelancers in your field with similar experience? If so, what do they charge for a project or for an hourly rate? Perhaps you only know people with far more or far less experience than you, in which case you should adjust your quote accordingly \u00b7 Don\u2019t forget your overheads/work out your bottom line: You need to be asking for enough money not just to provide a good salary but to cover the numerous overheads that full-time employees don\u2019t need to think about \u2013 for example, office supplies, internet costs, subscriptions, insurance fees \u00b7 Upskill yourself: The main ingredients to making yourself more valuable are your skills, experience and reputation. Look for training courses and certifications which you can complete and add to your CV \u00b7 Go above and beyond your client\u2019s expectations: It sounds simple, but going the extra mile for your client can quickly make you indispensable. They\u2019ll view you as a team player instead of just someone working for a paycheck and you\u2019ll put yourself in a great position to ask for more money \u00b7 Do your research: Before asking for a raise, try arming yourself with as much knowledge as possible. This means including any relevant work-related statistics on revenue you\u2019ve brought to the company, projects you\u2019ve successfully taken on, or initiatives you may have spearheaded. Just because you aren\u2019t a full-time employee doesn\u2019t mean you haven\u2019t made a difference for your clients \u00b7 Be willing to walk away: Pitch a rate to your client initially that\u2019s on the high end of your scale and leaves you a little room for negotiation, but give yourself a baseline. If your baseline isn\u2019t met, walk away.\n\nAt UnderPinned, we\u2019ve built a one-stop back office for freelancers and clients to navigate managing project-based work.\n\nThrough a collaboration with an innovative open banking payment firm called Banked, we will soon be able to provide a simplified, automated payment service which employers and freelancers can both benefit from, commission free.\n\nWe believe this will be a vast improvement on the current situation and help solve late payments.\n\nAs it stands, the law currently offers little to no protection and many freelancers, especially those in competitive sectors, choose to keep quiet for fear of a backlash from potential clients.\n\nOthers simply don\u2019t know what recourse is available to them when they are paid late or not at all, and don\u2019t have the time or resources to pursue employers. I believe introducing better technology and regulatory support for ensuring contracts are in place for freelance work will go a long way in helping build security around payments\n\nThe government must do more to solve these issues and there should be a minister dedicated to representing freelancers. We must also have better policies and should take heed of New York\u2019s recently passed freelancer bill, which offers various protective measures against non-payment while enforcing the use of contracts in certain situations.\n\nThis area of the workforce also desperately needs better regulation to promote financial wellbeing \u2013 unless there is urgent change, 3.3 million self-employed people could be left without a pension within the next 10 years, with 55% of self-employed people currently without one.\n\nAs the population of freelance workers grow, these problems will only become more pronounced. It is time for the government to acknowledge the contribution of freelance workers and engage with these issues negatively impacting this two-million strong group.", "description": "Albert de Symonds Azis-Clauson, of freelancer platform UnderPinned, discusses the future of freelance, the challenges the self-employed face and what they can do about it.", "authors": ["Albert De Symons Azis-Clauson", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
