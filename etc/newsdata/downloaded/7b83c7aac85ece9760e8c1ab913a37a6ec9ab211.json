CAT, +1.10% tumbled 4.5% in premarket trading Wednesday, after the mining, construction and agricultural heavy equipment maker reported third-quarter profit and revenue that missed expectations, and slashed its full-year outlook, as dealers reduced inventory and demand failed to meet forecasts. Net income fell to $1.49 billion, or $2.66 a share, from $1.73 billion, or $2.88 a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share came to $2.86, below the FactSet consensus of $2.90. Revenue declined 6.2% to $11.97 billion, missing the FactSet consensus of $13.41 billion, as dealers decreased their inventories by $400 million after increasing them by $800 million a year ago. Caterpillar cut its 2019 EPS guidance range to $10.90 to $11.40 from \"the low end\" of $12.06 to $13.06. \"Our volumes declined as dealers reduced their inventories, and end-user demand, while positive, was lower than our expectations,\" said Chief Executive Jim Umpleby. \"In the fourth quarter, we now expect end-user demand to be flat and dealers to make further inventory reductions due to global economic uncertainty.\"", "description": "Shares of Caterpillar Inc. tumbled 4.5% in premarket trading Wednesday, after the mining, construction and agricultural heavy equipment maker reported...", "authors": ["Tomi Kilgore", "Reporter"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
