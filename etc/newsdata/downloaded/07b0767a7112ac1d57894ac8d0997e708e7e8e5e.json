As we walked through the market, an assistant pushed a cart full of ingredients, which puzzled me until we arrived at one of For\u00e9s\u2019 favourite stalls, which had a lavish display of locally caught fish, sea urchins, shrimp and other seafood.\n\nThere was a flurry of activity as For\u00e9s pulled ingredients out of the cart, and her assistant and the fishmonger extracted the edible bits from the sea urchins, sliced some fish and shelled shrimp. Within minutes, we were eating the freshest kinilaw \u2013 raw seafood mixed with calamansi juice, vinegar and other seasonings. It was a delicious, quickly made snack.\n\nThe dressing for different types of kinilaw is not one-recipe-fits-all; the flavours should be tailored to the seafood. Sweet and more delicately flavoured seafood needs lighter, more subtle seasoning that doesn\u2019t over\u00adwhelm, while strong, oily fish can stand up to stronger flavours. Different areas of the Philippines use different ingredients, often including fish sauce, chillies or coconut milk.\n\nThe constants in almost all recipes are vinegar and calamansi. Avoid using cheap \u201cwhite vinegar\u201d for kinilaw; look for coconut or palm vinegar in shops specialising in ingredients from the Philippines, where you can also buy fresh calamansi. If you can\u2019t find coconut or palm vinegar, use rice vinegar.\n\nI prefer strong, oily fish for kinilaw \u2013 mackerel is my favourite, but any larger types are good (although I don\u2019t use salmon). We used a whole fish for this dish. A fish that weighs 1.2kg (42 1/3 oz) will yield about 500 grams (17 3/4 oz) of skinless fillet.\n\nFor ginger juice, grate fresh ginger on a ceramic grater, then drain the liquid and pulp in a small, fine sieve, pressing the solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Calamansi is a small lime with a distinctive taste and scent. It's essential to Filipino cooking, but if you can't find it, use Persian lime.", "description": "One of my most vivid food memories is visiting the Cubao Farmers Market, in Manila, with Margarita For\u00e9s, voted Asia\u2019s Best Female Chef in the 2016 Asia\u2019s 50\u2026", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_cooking/public/d8/images/2019/10/23/scmp_22aug19_fe_cooking13.jpg?itok=W5uYno4h", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
