The protest march is planned for Sunday, with organizers vowing to hold the event even though it failed to win approval from police, who cited risks to public order.\n\nAs the semi-autonomous Chinese territory\u2019s political crisis extends into a fifth month, protesters are trying to keep the pressure on the government to respond to their demands, including full democracy and an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality.\n\nThey\u2019re also using Sunday\u2019s rally to raise a more recent demand for the government to scrap a ban installed this month on face masks at public gatherings.\n\nOrganizers said demonstrators would defy the police because Hong Kong\u2019s constitution guarantees the right to protest.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think that because police haven\u2019t given their approval we shouldn\u2019t demonstrate,\u201d Figo Chan, vice-convener of the Civil Human Rights Front, told reporters. \u201cEven though they have rejected our appeal, there will surely be many residents taking to the streets.\u201d\n\nPolice said they arrested a 22-year-old man Saturday after a teenager was stabbed and wounded. The 19-year-old man was attacked while he was handing out leaflets near a wall decorated with pro-democracy messages, media reports said.\n\nMeanwhile, a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers including Republican Sen. Ted Cruz and Democratic Rep. Alexandra Ocasio Cortez wrote to tech company Apple and video game studio Activision Blizzard to condemn what they called protest-related censorship on behalf of China.\n\nThe group urged Apple to reverse its decision to remove from its app store the crowdsourced mapping app HKMaplive that was used to report police locations so that they could be avoided.\n\nThey also wrote separately to Activision to reconsider its decision to suspend a Hong Kong gamer after he voiced support for the protesters during an interview.\n\n\u201cCases like these raise real concerns about whether Apple and other large U.S. entities will bow to growing Chinese demands rather than lose access to more than a billion Chinese consumers,\u201d said the letter sent Friday and cosigned by Sens. Marco Rubio and Ron Wyden and Reps. Mike Gallagher and Tom Malinowski.\n\nThe lawmakers also cited China\u2019s pressure on the NBA after Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey\u2019s tweet in support of the protesters. On Friday night, some basketball fans held signs, wore shirts and chanted support for Hong Kong at a Brooklyn Nets preseason game.\n\nOne sign called out LeBron James and Nets owner Joe Tsai, co-founder of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, who were critical of Morey\u2019s tweet. Tsai wrote a Facebook post explaining why the since-deleted tweet upset China.\n\nAlso Saturday, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said the murder suspect whose case inadvertently helped ignite the city\u2019s protest movement wants to surrender to authorities in Taiwan after he\u2019s released from prison later this week for a different offense.\n\nLam said on a radio show that Chan Tong-Kai\u2019s decision to surrender has led to a \u201crelatively relieving\u201d conclusion to the case.\n\nChan is wanted by Taiwanese authorities for allegedly killing his girlfriend during a trip to the self-ruled island last year but wasn\u2019t sent back to face charges because there\u2019s no extradition agreement, though he was jailed in Hong Kong on money laundering charges.\n\nLam had tried to resolve the case by proposing extradition amendments, but the bill sparked massive protests over fears they would put Hong Kong residents at risk of being sent into mainland China\u2019s Communist Party-controlled judicial system.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Hong Kong anti-government protesters are set for another weekend of civil disobedience as they prepare to hold an unauthorized protest march to press their demands.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kelvin Chan"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/19/hong_kong_protests_76395_c0-208-5000-3124_s1200x700.jpg?74d48b7b24509088c15947da9892024c1a07cb57", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
