Obviously, any agreement must work for everyone, the whole of the United Kingdom and the whole of the European Union.\n\n\u201cLet me add also that it is high time to turn good intentions into a legal text.\u201d\n\nThis is a crunch week for Brexit negotiations as European leaders are set to meet for a two-day summit in Brussels from Thursday, at which Prime Minister Boris Johnson hopes to secure an exit treaty before the weekend.\n\nThe Remainer-dominated parliament passed the Benn Act which forces the prime minister to ask an extension of Article 50 \u2014 delaying Brexit \u2014 if London and Brussels fail to agree on an exit deal. The law also stops Mr Johnson delivering a clean-break Brexit on October 31st without the consent of parliament.\n\nThe British and Europeans have been holding confidential negotiations on a new deal that eliminates the Irish backstop. MPs had voted down Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal treaty three times in the House of Commons.\n\nPoll: Just One in Seven Britons Trust MPs on Brexit, Plurality Back No Deal https://t.co/pEPoIadOva \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 14, 2019\n\nSources speaking to The Telegraph said that there was \u201ccautious optimism\u201d over a deal being struck. It is understood that negotiators are discussing a hybrid compromise involving a \u201cdual customs\u201d territory in Northern Ireland.\n\n\u201cThese talks are really getting down to the nitty-gritty now. It is complicated, but it comes down to political will to get a deal done,\u201d the government source said.\n\nIf the EU and Mr Johnson\u2019s team agree, then it would then be voted on in the House of Commons on Saturday. It would be the first time that Parliament has sat on a weekend since the Falklands War.\n\nSpeaker of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg told LBC radio this morning that \u201cthe votes are there for a deal\u201d.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s desperate to finish this. It will get through the Commons,\u201d Mr Rees-Mogg said.", "description": "The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has said it is still \"possible\" to agree on an exit agreement \"this week\".", "authors": ["Victoria Friedman"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Michel-Barnier-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
