In the middle of the night, it\u2019s a guaranteed tripping hazard.\n\nMuseum Visitor Falls Into Giant Hole That Looks Like A Cartoonish Painting On The Floor Like a real-life version of a Looney Tunes cartoon, a visitor to a Portuguese museum was injured last week when he stepped into an art installation resembling an inky void. Currently on exhibit at the Serralves Museum in Porto, Descent Into Limbo by Anish Kapoor includes an actual 2.5m hole that\u2019s painted black \u2014 so it appears to have no depth at all.

The resulting effect is that most of the chair\u2019s contours are impossible to discern, making it look more like an amorphous blob to the naked eye.\n\nIt\u2019s a neat effect, and you\u2019ll certainly have fun watching visitors cautiously sit down in it, not exactly sure where their posterior is going to land.\n\nBut the Black 3.0 pigment used here technically isn\u2019t the blackest material around. That honour used to belong to Surrey NanoSystems\u2019 Vantablack which, using lab-grown nanotubes as one of its ingredients, is able to absorb 99.965 per cent of light. The title now belongs to researchers at MIT who created a new super-black material that absorbs 99.995 per cent of incoming light.\n\nUnfortunately, in 2016 artist Anish Kapoor secured the exclusive rights to Vantablack, and MIT hasn\u2019t made its material available to the masses yet, which is why this chair instead uses Stuart Semple\u2019s slightly less effective alternative, as it\u2019s actually commercially available.\n\nDespite being painted with a material that sounds like it\u2019s straight out of science fiction, the Supervoid S-Chair can be yours for just $US299 ($442) plus shipping. There are chairs at IKEA that are more expensive than that, and the only gimmick they boast is a flat-pack design and free wrenches.", "description": "It doesn\u2019t take your eyes long to adjust to the dark of night \u2014 or at least adjust enough so you can safely stumble your way to a midnight bathroom break.
