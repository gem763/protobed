I really cannot understand how people chose him to be driver of the day,\" he added.\n\nAnother former driver, Vitaly Petrov, added: \"Again and again, he shows that he is still a boy who cannot restrain his emotions.\"\n\nAnd former Red Bull driver and Verstappen's fellow Dutchman Robert Doornbos told Ziggo Sport: \"In Spa, Japan and now in Mexico, he had collisions.\n\n\"That's why he is missing so many points. You may have race incidents, but it is unacceptable that it is happening as often as it is at the moment.\"", "description": "'On the one hand it creates many fans for him, but he also finds many critics who find him immature and arrogant,' according to Italian newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8230/d24910b8eb454be8b163fec1322e44d0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
