I have death threats constantly. There are a number of people who have been convicted for threatening to kill me,\u201d Ms. Waters said. \u201cI can\u2019t go to the grocery store anymore by myself. I have to pay for security all the time. I can\u2019t move around the country without security.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Wash Times", "Washingtontimes.Com News Oct Maxine-Waters-Trump-Setting-Some-Of-Us-Up-To-Be-Ki"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
