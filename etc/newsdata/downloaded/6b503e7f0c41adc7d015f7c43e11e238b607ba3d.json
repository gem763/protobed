It is not an outcome we seek at all. But let me tell you this conference it is an outcome for which we are ready,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also warned. \"I am afraid that after three and a half years people are beginning to feel that they are being taken for fools. They are beginning to suspect that there are forces in this country that simply don\u2019t want Brexit delivered at all.\n\n\"And if they turn out to be right in that suspicion then I believe there will be grave consequences for trust in democracy. Let\u2019s get Brexit done on October 31.\"\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium Brexit service for professionals: Brexit Pro.
