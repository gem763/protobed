Yet his Northern Irish allies are opposed to a deal and the three main opposition parties have pledged to vote it down.\n\n\"We\u2019ve got a great new deal that takes back control \u2014 now parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday,\" Johnson said ahead of the first Saturday sitting of parliament since the 1982 Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands.\n\nIf he wins the vote, Johnson will go down in history as the leader who delivered Brexit - for good or bad. If he fails, Johnson will face the humiliation of Brexit unfurling after repeatedly promising that he would get it done.\n\nJohnson won the top job by staking his career on getting Brexit done by the latest deadline of Oct. 31 after his predecessor, Theresa May, was forced to delay Britain's departure date after parliament thrice defeated her deal by a margin of 58 to 230 votes.\n\nDowning Street is casting the Saturday vote as a last chance to get Brexit done with lawmakers facing the option of either approving the deal or propelling the United Kingdom to a disorderly no-deal exit that could divide the West, hurt global growth and trigger violence in Northern Ireland.\n\n\"PRETTY CLOSE\"\n\nYet the future of Brexit remains uncertain as Johnson's opponents have passed a law demanding he delay Brexit unless he gets a deal approved.\n\nThe government has said it will both comply with this law and that Britain will leave the EU on Oct. 31 whatever happens. Johnson has not explained how he plans to take these two apparently contradictory steps.\n\nAs lawmakers mull one of the United Kingdom's most significant geopolitical moves since World War Two, hundreds of thousands are due to march towards parliament demanding another referendum on EU membership.\n\nParliament will sit from 0830 GMT on Saturday. Johnson will make a statement to lawmakers, followed by a 90-minute debate and then there will be a vote.\n\nThe Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said it would oppose the deal and lobby a faction of around 28 hard line Brexit supporters in Johnson's Conservative Party to do the same.\n\n\"We will be encouraging (other lawmakers to vote against) because we believe it does have an impact on the unity of the United Kingdom, will spark further nationalist sentiment in Scotland and will be detrimental to the economy of Northern Ireland,\" the DUP's Sammy Wilson said.\n\n\"Voting this down tomorrow is not the end of the game, in fact it probably opens up possibilities for the government which are not available at present after a general election.\"\n\nWithout the DUP's 10 votes, Johnson will need Brexit-supporting Labour Party rebels to support his deal.\n\nSaturday's vote will be \"pretty close\" but likely just fall short, John McDonnell, the second most powerful man in the opposition Labour Party said.\n\n\"I don't believe it will pass, I think it will be defeated but... the numbers are going to be pretty close,\" McDonnell told Sky News.\n\nIf the vote is a tie, then the speaker of parliament, John Bercow, would hold the deciding vote. According to vague convention, the speaker would seek to keep the issue open for further discussion.", "description": "Brexit on a knife edge as PM Johnson stakes all on 'Super Saturday' vote", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9H0LP-OCATP_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
