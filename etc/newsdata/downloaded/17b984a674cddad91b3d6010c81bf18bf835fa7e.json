The intention is still there.\"\n\nTulagi \u2014 a slug-shaped strip of land across from Guadalcanal with around 2,000 residents \u2014 has a natural deepwater port. John F. Kennedy was sent there to recover after his torpedo boat, the PT-109, was attacked in 1943, and before the war, the island was the Solomons' capital under British and then Japanese rule.\n\nThe signing of the agreement for Tulagi had been initially heralded locally as a way to spur long-awaited development. But once details of the signed deal emerged through leaked copies reported in The New York Times and elsewhere, residents mobilized, demanding clarifications on property rights, plans for payment, and China Sam's plans.\n\n\"They were called out,\" Kenilorea said. \"If whoever took those snapshots didn't take them, I think this would have gone ahead without anyone knowing.\"\n\nHe and other opponents of the agreement noted that despite the announcement, Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare's government had previously welcomed China Sam executives to the country. And during Sogavare's recent trip to China, which followed the country's decision to cut ties with Taiwan and establish formal relations with Beijing, he met with China Sam's senior leaders.\n\nThe company has not commented on its plans and could not be immediately reached for comment on Friday.\n\nBut Kenilorea said there were many other deals in motion between Chinese investors and the Solomon Islands' government that also deserve more scrutiny.\n\nFive memorandums of understanding were signed with Chinese entities after the Solomons cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan. But beyond broad-brush descriptions, few details are known. Kenilorea said he was still waiting for a response to his request for copies of the actual agreements.\n\nEarlier this week, the government held a news conference about the national telecom provider, where officials suggested working with Huawei, the Chinese technology giant, whose products the Trump administration has contended could be used by the Chinese government for spying.\n\n\"Those kinds of utterances reveal to me that their interests go to other parts of the country and other sectors,\" Kenilorea said.\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "The attorney general's office says the the agreement should be terminated because it lacked vital details, and encroached on the powers of the national government.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_28/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/10d7dfaca8d6a13716c92de6432dec7e652acad2", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
