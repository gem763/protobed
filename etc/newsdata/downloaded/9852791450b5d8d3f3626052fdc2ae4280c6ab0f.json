Join the race directly.\u201d\n\nClinton has not directly responded, but her spokesman, Nick Merrill, told CNN, \u201cIf the nesting doll fits.\u201d\n\nMerrill, in an interview Saturday, said Clinton was \u201cnot saying Americans are Russian spies but that Russia has found ways to take advantage and is not being held responsible by anyone in government.\u201d\n\nFew outside Clinton\u2019s immediate orbit defended her comments. The closest anyone came was Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who retweeted Gabbard\u2019s reaction to Clinton with a viral GIF from the June debate when he glanced \u201cside eyed\u201d \u2014 a look that often conveys shock or disdain \u2014 at another candidate. That garnered a reply from Clinton \u2014 a viral GIF of her own from a 2016 debate where she exhales, says, \u201cokay,\u201d smiles and shimmies her shoulders.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMinnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, whose Iowa bus tour had been overshadowed by the Gabbard-Clinton fight, told reporters on Friday that Clinton could \u201cdefend herself, and will.\u201d Asked about the story again on Saturday, she pivoted to talk about her election integrity legislation.\n\n\u201cThis is something I\u2019m not getting into right now,\u201d she said. \u201cI will talk about election security, because I think that\u2019s much more significant than any Twitter fight going on right now.\u201d\n\nBut two of the nonpoliticians in the Democratic primary, entrepreneur Andrew Yang and author Marianne Williamson, sided with Gabbard.\n\nYang tweeted that Gabbard, a veteran, \u201cdeserves much more respect and thanks than this.\u201d Williamson accused the Democratic establishment of \u201csmearing women it finds inconvenient.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe character assassination of women who don\u2019t toe the party line will backfire. Stay strong @TulsiGabbard. You deserve respect and you have mine,\u201d Williamson tweeted.\n\nAD\n\nNotably, Clinton \u2014 who made the comments on a podcast hosted by David Plouffe, a former adviser to President Barack Obama \u2014 never used Gabbard\u2019s name. But Gabbard is the only female candidate in the Democratic primary who has been accused of having ties to Russia.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not making any predictions, but I think they\u2019ve got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nGabbard has repeatedly ruled out running as a third-party candidate. But she has been courted to run in the general election outside the Democratic Party by activists who believe the two-party system is corrupt and should be cast aside.\n\nAD\n\nStein has suggested in the past that Gabbard \u201cshould become a Green\u201d because her comments were \u201csimilar to our message.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn the podcast interview, Clinton also accused Stein, who won more votes in several states than Trump\u2019s margin of victory over Clinton, of being a tool of the Russians.\n\n\u201cYes, she\u2019s a Russian asset, I mean, totally,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThey know they can\u2019t win without a third-party candidate.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump weighed in on on the dispute Saturday afternoon, urging a third party Green Party candidate to run in 2020, which would benefit him by peeling off Democratic voters.\n\n\u201cCrooked Hillary Clinton just called the respected environmentalist and Green Party candidate, Jill Stein, a \u2018Russian Asset.\u2019 They need a Green Party more than ever after looking at the Democrats disastrous environmental program!\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nAD\n\nWhile it\u2019s unclear why Clinton initiated this fight, the bad blood between her and Gabbard goes back to 2016, when Gabbard quit her post as a Democratic National Committee vice chair so she could endorse Clinton\u2019s primary opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I) of Vermont.\n\nAD\n\nGabbard is an unconventional Democrat, whose message of an isolationist foreign policy and willingness to buck the party establishment has gained her fans among the far right. She\u2019s a frequent guest on Fox News, often Tucker Carlson\u2019s show. She went on Friday night to talk to Carlson about her clash with Clinton.\n\nShe has also gained a following with some white nationalists. A neo-Nazi website called Daily Stormer said it deserved credit for getting her the support necessary to qualify for the first two debates.\n\nAD\n\nBut the main reason many Democrats, including Clinton, are wary of her is because she\u2019s a favorite topic on Russian websites and social media.\n\n\u201cHillary is absolutely going to continue to call balls and strikes as she sees them because while she knows she was on the receiving end of it in 2016, our 2020 nominee will face the same threat,\u201d said Philippe Reines, a former Clinton adviser.\n\nGabbard was back on the campaign trail Saturday, holding two town hall meetings in Iowa, including one in the town of Clinton.\n\nDavid Weigel in Ames, Iowa and Michael Scherer contributed to this story.\n\nAD", "description": "Hillary Clinton suggested that Rep.
