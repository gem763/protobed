She was the vice president of marketing at Amazon in the late 1990s.\n\nNakedPoppy was born out of Bisharat's frustrated attempts to find clean makeup and skin-care products \u2014 those that are sustainably sourced and free of harmful chemicals. Today, NakedPoppy customers get help finding those products, which are all algorithmically matched to their precise skin tones.\n\nWith any new NakedPoppy hire, Bisharat said, she wants to feel that if that person couldn't accomplish something, \"nobody could because they're so resourceful and so creative and so determined and relentless that they will solve any problem.\"\n\nBisharat explained why doggedness was important in startup hires. \"Most companies hit their hiccups and their tough points,\" she said. \"The question is whether you have the team that can learn from and adjust to the market, adjust to the learning, and be sure it's solving a problem that customers really care about.\"\n\nBeing an autonomous problem solver may get you promoted too\n\nEven executives at more established organizations say they seek candidates who take initiative \u2014 and who don't stop until they get the job done.\n\nTraci Wilk, the senior vice president of people at The Learning Experience and a former human-resources exec at Starbucks, previously told Business Insider that she was most inclined to promote someone \"willing to step up and be a leader and say, 'OK, I'm going to take this challenge\" \u2014 for example, volunteering for a project in another department \u2014 \"and I'm going to either go off and do the research on my own, or I'm going to help others.'\"\n\nMeanwhile, an anecdote in Dale Carnegie's 1948 book, \"How to Stop Worrying and Start Living,\" illustrates just how much bosses value independent problem-solving. Leon Shimkin, who was then a general manager at the publishing house Simon & Schuster, told Carnegie that he'd devised a way to cut meeting times by 75%: He informed his team that they couldn't present any problems unless they'd first tried to think of a solution.\n\nRead more: Becoming a 'big picture' thinker is one of the best ways to succeed at work. Here's how.\n\nBuilding a team of problem solvers is crucial to a startup's success\n\nAn employee's ability to solve problems independently doesn't appear to be a function of raw intelligence.\n\nJoe Folkman, the president of the leadership consultancy Zenger Folkman, wrote in Forbes that his research on 6,000 individual contributors and 76,000 managers pointed to five skills underpinning problem-solving prowess: technical expertise, a desire to innovate, an understanding of the organization's overall strategy, drive and tenacity, and exceptional interpersonal skills.\n\nAs for NakedPoppy, Bisharat said building a team of problem solvers was essential to a startup's success. \"When you start a company, there's some risk there,\" she said. \"But actually, the biggest risk is in not assembling the right team to see their way around every corner.\"", "description": "Startup job candidates should be able to solve problems on their own, without hand-holding from their manager, NakedPoppy CEO Jaleh Bisharat said.", "authors": ["Shana Lebowitz"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7fc2e12e22af2118280309-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
