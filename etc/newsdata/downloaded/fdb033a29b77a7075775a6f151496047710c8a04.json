The Turkish air strikes killed at least five civilians and three fighters from the SDF and wounded dozens of civilians, the SDF said.\n\nReuters journalists at Akcakale on the Turkish side of the frontier watched as explosions struck Tel Abyad. After dark, the red flare of rockets could be seen fired across the border into Tel Abyad, and flames burned near the town. Explosions from Tel Abyad could be heard eight hours into the bombardment. A witness reached by telephone said civilians were fleeing en masse.\n\nSDF fighters repelled a ground attack by Turkish troops in Tel Abyad, SDF spokesman Mustafa Bali said on Twitter.\n\nThe assault on the Kurds - for years Washington's main allies on the ground in Syria - is potentially one of the biggest shifts in years in the Syrian war that has drawn in global and regional powers. The Kurds played a leading role in capturing territory from Islamic State, and now hold the largest swathe of Syria outside of the hands of President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nRussia, Assad's strongest foreign ally, urged dialogue between Damascus and Syria's Kurds.\n\nTrump's decision to pull forces out of the way was denounced by some Kurds as a \"stab in the back\".\n\n\n\n\n\n'BAD IDEA'\n\nTrump called the Turkish assault a \"bad idea\" and said he did not endorse it. He expected Turkey to protect civilians and religious minorities and prevent a humanitarian crisis, he said.\n\nBut one of Trump's closest fellow Republican allies, Senator Lindsey Graham, said failing to support the Kurds would be \"the biggest mistake of his presidency\".\n\nRepresentative Liz Cheney, a Republican hawk, said: \"The U.S. is abandoning our ally the Kurds, who fought ISIS (Islamic State) on the ground and helped protect the U.S. homeland. This decision aids America\u2019s adversaries, Russia, Iran, and Turkey, and paves the way for a resurgence of ISIS.\"\n\nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan, announcing the start of the action, said the aim was to eliminate what he called a \"terror corridor\" on Turkey's southern border.\n\nEuropean and Arab countries called on Ankara to halt.\n\nTurkey had been poised to enter northeast Syria since the U.S. troops who had been fighting alongside Kurdish-led forces against Islamic State started to leave.\n\nA Turkish security source told Reuters the military offensive, dubbed \"Operation Peace Spring\", opened with air strikes. Turkish howitzer fire then hit bases and ammunition depots of the Kurdish YPG militia. Turkey says the YPG, the main component of the U.S.-backed SDF, is a terrorist group linked to Kurdish insurgents that have fought in Turkey for years.\n\nThe artillery strikes, which also targeted YPG gun and sniper positions, were aimed at sites far from residential areas, the Turkish source said.\n\nThe Turkish army has hit a total of 181 militant targets with air strikes and howitzers since the start of the operation, the defense ministry said on Wednesday.\n\nExplosions also rocked the Syrian border town of Ras al Ain, according to a reporter for CNN Turk. The sound of warplanes could be heard above and smoke rose from buildings in the town, the CNN reporter said.", "description": "Turkish troops and their Syrian rebel allies attacked Kurdish militia in northeast Syria on Wednesday, pounding them with air strikes and artillery before starting a cross-border ground operation that could transform an eight-year-old war.
