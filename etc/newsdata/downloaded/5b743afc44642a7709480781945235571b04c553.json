This is almost entirely her own fault because I don\u2019t recall anyone else bringing it up until she started telling the tale repeatedly on the campaign trail. A bit of investigation by the Washington Free Beacon soon revealed that she had actually been offered another term teaching and her resignation had been accepted \u201cwith regret.\u201d\n\nReporting on the story is, however, apparently some sort of sin, at least in the eyes of Margaret Sullivan at the Washington Post. It\u2019s a \u201csmear.\u201d And this terrible attack on Warren\u2019s honesty and credibility must be put to rights one way or another. With that in mind, the author launches into a defense of Warren, opening with the mindboggling sentence, \u201cA news report can be narrowly factual, and still plenty unfair.\u201d\n\nLady, you had me at \u201cnarrowly factual.\u201d Let\u2019s see what this is about.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the next day that some much-needed perspective began to emerge, thanks to a CBS News report. It included crucial context that would have been ever-so-helpful in the initial piece, like this interview with a retired Riverdale teacher, Trudy Randall: \u201cThe rule was at five months you had to leave when you were pregnant. Now, if you didn\u2019t tell anybody you were pregnant, and they didn\u2019t know, you could fudge it and try to stay on a little bit longer. But they kind of wanted you out if you were pregnant.\u201d\n\nThe author goes on to quote Warren\u2019s latest explanation of this apparent contradiction, saying that she was pregnant but \u201cnobody knew it.\u201d And when it became too obvious to hide, the principal called her into the office, wished her luck and said he was going to \u201chire somebody else for the job.\u201d That\u2019s a statement full of implications, but notice how she still never comes out and says the words \u201che fired me\u201d or any variation along those lines.\n\nAnd why would the official record show that the school accepted her resignation \u201cwith regret\u201d if the official policy was to ask female teachers to leave at five months into their pregnancy?\n\nThis all supposedly took place almost fifty years ago in 1971, before many people reading this were even born. Presumably, anyone who had been around long enough to rise to the rank of principal or sit on the school board was at least in their thirties or forties by then, so they\u2019re likely no longer alive. Certainly someone would have sought out an interview with the principal were he still among the living. So what we have here is Warren\u2019s word against that of a dead man.\n\nThe statement from the retired teacher offers no indication that she was familiar with the circumstances of Warren\u2019s departure or if the two even knew each other. She\u2019s describing her impression of what could generously be called an unofficial policy. In other words, you can believe what was reported in the minutes from the Riverdale, N.J. school board or what Warren is now saying. (I specify \u201cnow\u201d because it\u2019s also been pointed out that she described her departure from the school during a 2007 interview without ever mentioning being fired.)\n\nIn other words, this entire piece builds a case for why it\u2019s still possible that Warren is telling the truth without offering a single bit of factual evidence or even first-person testimony from anyone involved in the situation in 1971. It\u2019s pure speculation, but apparently sufficient to call any reference to the school\u2019s records a \u201csmear.\u201d Of course, Sullivan later goes on to describe Warren\u2019s claims of significant Native American heritage as a \u201cblunder.\u201d (Which sounds so much nicer than a lie.)\n\nBut hey\u2026 just because something is \u201cnarrowly factual\u201d doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s true, right?", "description": "The unfairness of it all", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/EWarren.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
