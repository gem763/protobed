Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nCampaign flagging? Reboot it. Strategy not working? Reset it. Running for president in a crowded field of Democrats and desperate for attention? Flip your campaign upside down and tell the world you\u2019re starting over.\n\nWith so many Democrats angling for a breakout moment in the party\u2019s presidential primary, reboots, resets, and rethinks have become as much a part of the race as arguing over health-care policy. Here\u2019s a look back at all of the 2020 Democratic candidates\u2019 attempts to change course.\n\nKamala Harris\n\nThe latest candidate to shake things up is California senator Harris. Late Wednesday, Politico reported that Harris is \u201cputting her stumbling campaign on the line with a new Iowa-or-bust strategy.\u201d She\u2019s turning her attention away from high-dollar fundraisers and toward the folks on the prairie who, in four short months, could decide her fate. That means doubling her 65-person staff in Iowa and making weekly visits to the state she hasn\u2019t touched down in since August. As she joked to Hawaii senator Mazie Hirono on Wednesday, \u201cI\u2019m fucking moving to Iowa.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t even the first reboot for Harris, who in May attempted to \u201creset her campaign after stagnating in Democratic-primary polls, using her strengths as a prosecutor \u2026 to mount a sharp indictment of Mr. Trump,\u201d the Times reported.\n\nJoe Biden\n\nFor a guy who has been atop the polls since the moment he entered the race, Biden has seen more than his fair share of reboots. Following the first debate, and in the face of mounting criticism of his record on issues including busing and working with segregationists, Biden sought a \u201creboot\u201d that Axios called the \u201cwrap the bow\u201d strategy. The idea was to deflect any criticism on issues regarding race by saying something like \u201cIf I was good enough for Obama, then I can\u2019t be all bad.\u201d\n\nSeveral weeks later, ahead of the second Democratic debate, Senator Jack Reed told the Washington Examiner that Biden was \u201creconfiguring\u201d his campaign. The plan? Start attacking rivals head-on. Presumably, this is why Biden said of Elizabeth Warren in the third debate, \u201cI know that the senator says she\u2019s for Bernie. Well, I\u2019m for Barack. I think Obamacare worked.\u201d\n\nCory Booker\n\nAny moment now, Booker is going to have his breakout moment in the Democratic primary. Any. Moment. Now. Frustrated with his standing as a second-tier candidate, Booker sought a shake-up back in April. That\u2019s when he launched a two-week national tour. Politico described it as a \u201cnew phase designed to sharpen his message and distinguish himself from the pack.\u201d The tour also served as an acknowledgement that his \u201cmessage of love and unity\u201d had fallen flat. So it was time to reboot.\n\nPete Buttigieg\n\nThe South Bend mayor\u2019s out-of-nowhere success might suggest that he needs to change nothing. But even wunderkinds need resets. Buttigieg\u2019s came in late August when it became clear that after raising gobs of money, he also needed to get to work on the ground. So his campaign entered what his senior adviser Lis Smith called \u201cphase three:\u201d \u201cBlow them out of the water with our organization and our organizational abilities.\u201d It seems that means working to catch up to other campaigns in early caucus and primary states, and hiring a black outreach director.\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke\n\nNo candidate has rebooted more than O\u2019Rourke, who been trying for months to recapture the acclaim he won when he launched. In May, he tried to \u201creinvigorate\u201d his campaign, the Washington Post reported, with an appearance on The View and an acknowledgement of his privilege. Up until that point, he\u2019d shunned national TV in favor of standing on bar tops and diner counters to talk to voters.\n\nThat new strategy lasted about two months. By late July, after his lackluster showing in the first debate, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s aides told Yahoo News he was planning to reintroduce himself at the second debate by \u201ctrying to achieve a delicate balance, coming across forcefully without seeming overly aggressive.\u201d\n\nThen, in early August, a gunman went on a rampage in El Paso, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s hometown. The candidate spent nearly two weeks off the campaign trail and emerged with yet another new strategy: a campaign focused on gun control. The late-August shooting spree in West Texas further solidified the strategy, which had come to include a new catchphrase: \u201cThis is fucked up.\u201d He followed this with a declaration in the third debate, \u201cHell, yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,\u201d drawing criticism from Republicans and some Democrats who think the line may make it harder to pass bipartisan gun legislation.\n\nBernie Sanders\n\nWith perhaps the most die-hard fan base of any of the Democrats, it stands to reason that Sanders would just need to keep on doing what he\u2019s doing. But in late May, he unveiled what CNN called a \u201cnew strategy\u201d: He started taking selfies after campaign events. Then in August, Politico reported that the \u201cstalled Sanders campaign orchestrated [a] reboot\u201d with \u201ca renewed focus\u201d on Medicare for All.\n\nElizabeth Warren\n\nThe Massachusetts senator caused trouble for herself several months before she even launched her campaign with an ill-considered DNA test meant to address the questions around her claims of Native American ancestry. By the time she launched her campaign, it was itself seen as a reboot of her image, or as the Post put it, a chance to \u201creset the conversation about her candidacy and refocus it on her message of bolstering the middle class.\u201d", "description": "With so many Democrats angling for a breakout moment, regular strategy shifts have become the norm in the primary race.
