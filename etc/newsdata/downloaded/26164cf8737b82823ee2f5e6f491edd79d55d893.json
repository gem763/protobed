There has to be some sort of attraction and tension, whether you are photographing a man or a woman.\u201d\n\nFRANK SINATRA\u2019S ATTORNEY WARNED STAR NOT TO MARRY MARILYN MONROE OVER HER SUICIDAL THOUGHTS, PODCAST CLAIMS\n\nOn Tuesday Christie\u2019s is auctioning the camera from that session, a 1958 Hasselblad, along with the lenses that captured the photos, as well as two prints from the shoot. It is expected to fetch $200,000 - $300,000. According to Christie\u2019s, the buyer will also have the opportunity to host Kirkland for dinner, where he\u2019ll shoot his or her portrait with the same camera.\n\nKirkland was only 27 years old when he received his first assignment \u2014 to photograph Monroe for Look magazine\u2019s 25th anniversary issue. According to the outlet, Kirkland was worried the Hollywood star would sense his inexperience and demand another photographer.\n\nInstead, Monroe requested Dom Perignon champagne and Frank Sinatra records.\n\nThe outlet revealed that Monroe was two hours late for the session when she arrived as \u201ca burst of ethereal beauty\u201d at 9:30 p.m. A nervous Kirkland immediately poured the champagne and played a Sinatra record as she \u201csashayed into a dressing room\u201d with her hair and makeup team.\n\nMARILYN MONROE WAS 'JUST IN AWE' OF ARTHUR MILLER, DIDN\u2019T SEDUCE \u2018NERVOUS\u2019 PHOTOGRAPHER\n\nMARILYN MONROE GAVE TEEN 'GROUPIES' COMPLETE ACCESS TO HER LIFE, DOC REVEALS: \u2018SHE ALWAYS MADE HERSELF AVAILABLE\u2019\n\nHowever, Kirkland claimed Monroe wasn\u2019t thrilled with his initial idea to photograph her wearing an ankle-length dress with a long piece of white cloth. He claimed \u201cshe stomped\u201d and complained the fabric was \u201ccheap cheesecloth.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a cheesecloth kind of girl,\u201d said Monroe.\n\nThe moment provided an epiphany for the young photographer.\n\n\"I was learning another important lesson of my profession,\" Kirkland said. \"You must treat a star like the princess you want her to be in front of your lens if you are to elicit her most outstanding performance.\u201d\n\nKirkland feared Monroe was going to walk out. She didn\u2019t. Instead, Monroe wore a white dressing gown that she \u201cimmediately took off.\u201d Then she slipped into bed, under a single silk sheet.\n\n\u201cI stole little glances of her backside and breasts as she moved,\u201d said Kirkland. \u201cShe may have intended for me to catch those little glimpses.\u201d\n\nMARILYN MONROE FILMED LOST NUDE SCENE TO PLEASE AUDIENCES, WAS 'FURIOUS' ON HER LAST DAY ALIVE, BOOK CLAIMS\n\nMARILYN MONROE AVOIDED THE CASTING COUCH, FOUGHT TO SHED SEX SYMBOL STATUS, BOOK CLAIMS\n\nKirkland shared it was \u201cvery exciting for me in my young man way\u201d and Monroe \u201cwas within arm\u2019s reach, twisting and turning under the sheet, which was semi-transparent.\u201d\n\nKirkland started snapping away when Monroe suddenly declared, \u201cI know what we need \u2014 I need to be alone with this boy. I find it usually works better that way.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Monroe] showed me how she felt, slithering erotically between the sheets,\u201d he reflected. However, he insisted nothing came from the night and instead, it \u201cwas just an exciting tease.\u201d\n\n\u201c[She] was just being Marilyn and playing to the camera as she knew how to do very well,\u201d he explained.\n\nAnd the photographer, who was married to his high school sweetheart at the time, said his photos of Monroe from that night would not have turned out as captivating if he had given in to temptation.\n\nMARILYN MONROE\u2019S ICONIC COSTUMES FROM \u2018GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES,\u2019 \u2018RIVER OF NO RETURN\u2019 UP FOR AUCTION\n\nBLANCA BLANCO STRIPS DOWN LIKE MARILYN MONROE FOR 60-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF \u2018SOME LIKE IT HOT\u2019\n\n\u201cWe were both on such a fine, teetering edge,\u201d he said. \u201cUltimately, all of that fused energy was channeled directly into the lens.\u201d\n\nAt one point, Kirkland claimed, Monroe \u201cpleaded\u201d for him to join her in bed.\n\nTwo ended up lying next to each other as they spoke about their lives.\n\n\u201cShe told me about her difficult beginnings,\" he said, \"and I told her about coming from a small town in Canada and never dreaming I would someday be photographing the goddess she had become.\"\n\nMonroe and her team didn\u2019t leave the studio until well past midnight. Kirkland told the outlet he had trouble sleeping that night at the Chateau Marmont hotel, wondering what might have been.\n\n\u201cWe had nearly been lovers an hour earlier and now she was gone,\u201d he reflected. \u201cThe Marilyn Monroe I had been with on that night of the shoot unquestionably took a firm hold on me. She arrived in a misty vision, and when she left it was as if she had evaporated. I admitted to myself with some embarrassment that I missed her already.\u201d\n\nJACK LEMMON\u2019S SON SAYS ACTOR ALMOST MISSED OUT ON \u2018SOME LIKE IT HOT,' PUT \u2018TROUBLED\u2019 MARILYN MONROE AT EASE\n\nJANE SEYMOUR RECALLS AWKWARD LOVE SCENE WITH RICHARD CHAMBERLAIN: \u2018IT WAS VERY DEVASTATING\u2019\n\nKirkland said he was stunned when he went to Monroe\u2019s home the following day to show her the photographs he\u2019d taken.\n\nThe woman who answered the door wasn\u2019t the glamorous screen siren he spent the night with, Kirkland said, but rather a \u201cdarker, sadder\u201d woman who sounded \u201cdrawn, tired and disturbed\u201d while wearing sunglasses and a scarf over her head.\n\nKirkland claimed that initially, Monroe bluntly told him that the photographs \u201caren\u2019t great\u201d and cut up half of them with scissors. However, the star lit up when she finally found a photo she liked.\n\n\u201cI like this girl because she\u2019s the kind of woman every man would like to be in there with,\u201d Monroe told Kirkland about a photo of her clutching a white pillow. \u201cThe kind of girl a truck driver would like to be in that bed with.\u201d\n\nAccording to Kirkland, Monroe told him, \u201cI want to do this with you again, real soon.\u201d\n\nMAE WEST\u2019S ASSISTANT SAYS \u201830S SEX SYMBOL WASN\u2019T A FAN OF NUDITY IN FILMS\n\n'AVENGERS' STAR ELIZABETH OLSEN EXPLAINS WHY WE NEED 'ALL REPRESENTATIONS OF SUPERHEROES'\n\nThe two never worked together again.
