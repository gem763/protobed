The year before that marked flu\u2019s highest death toll in recent decades.\n\nSo far, it doesn\u2019t look like the flu season is getting an early start, Jernigan said. The CDC urges people to get their flu vaccine by the end of October. Typically flu starts widely circulating in November or December, and peaks by February.\n\nScientists are hunting for better flu vaccines, and the Trump administration last week urged a renewed effort to modernize production. Most of today\u2019s vaccine is produced by growing flu virus in chicken eggs, a 70-year-old technology with some flaws. It takes too long to brew new doses if a surprise strain pops up. And intriguingly, newer production techniques just might boost effectiveness.\n\nFor now, people who get vaccinated and still get sick can expect a milder illness - and a lower risk of pneumonia, hospitalization or death, stressed Dr. William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University and the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.\n\nHe\u2019s been known to tell such patients, \u201cI\u2019m always glad to see you\u2019re still here to complain.\u201d\n\nHere are some things to know:\n\nWHO NEEDS VACCINE?\n\nEverybody, starting at 6 months of age, according to the CDC.\n\nFlu is most dangerous for people over age 65, young children, pregnant women and people with certain health conditions such as heart disease, asthma or other lung disorders, even diabetes.\n\nBut it can kill even the young and otherwise healthy. On average, the CDC says flu kills about 24,000 Americans each year.\n\nHOW MANY GET VACCINATED?\n\nNot enough, the CDC says. Because flu mutates rapidly, a new vaccine is needed every year. Last year, 45% of adults and 63% of children got vaccinated, according to figures released Thursday.\n\nSome groups do a little better. Nearly three-quarters of children under age 5 were vaccinated last year, and just over two-thirds of seniors.\n\nHOW BAD WILL THIS YEAR BE?\n\nFlu is one of medicine\u2019s most unpredictable foes.\n\nFor example, last fall started off fairly mild. But in February, a strain notorious for more severe illness, called H3N2, suddenly popped up. Worse, even though each year\u2019s vaccine contains protection against H3N2, the circulating bug had mutated so it wasn\u2019t a good match. A vaccine that had worked well for the first few months of flu season suddenly wasn\u2019t much use.\n\nBut if that harsh bug returns, this year\u2019s vaccine has been updated to better match it.\n\nLOTS OF OPTIONS\n\nManufacturers say 162 million to 169 million vaccine doses will be available this year, and people can ask about different choices. Most will offer protection against four flu strains.\n\nTraditional flu shots are for all ages. For needle-phobic adults, one brand uses a needle-free jet injector that pushes vaccine through the skin. And the FluMist nasal spray is for generally healthy people ages 2 through 49.\n\nTwo brands are specifically for the 65-plus crowd, whose weakened immune systems don\u2019t respond as well to traditional shots. One is high dose, and the other contains an extra immune-boosting compound. Those brands protect against three flu strains, including the more typically severe ones.\n\nAnd people allergic to eggs have two options, one brand grown in mammal cells instead and another made with genetic technology and insect cells.\n\nNO-EGG VACCINES GAINING NEW INTEREST\n\nNewer technologies could speed production, which is currently a six-month process.\n\nBut there\u2019s another reason going egg-free is getting scientists\u2019 attention: Certain strains change a bit while growing in chicken eggs, an adaptation that can make the resulting vaccine a little less protective.\n\nIt\u2019s mainly a problem for those worrisome H3N2 strains. While it\u2019s not clear how much difference that makes, Schaffner said some doctors already consider using egg-free brands for high-risk patients.\n\nOTHER STEPS TO TAKE\n\nCover coughs and sneezes. Wash your hands frequently during flu season. One recent study showed washing is better than hand sanitizers.\n\nAsk about anti-flu treatments if you\u2019re at high risk of complications.\n\nAnd most important, stay home if you\u2019re sick to keep from spreading the misery.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.
