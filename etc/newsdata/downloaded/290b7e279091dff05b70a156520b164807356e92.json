It shouldn't be legal for anyone. Police are not above the law.'", "description": "Officers across England and Wales will be able to have greater confidence in carrying out 'tactical contact' after the IOPC said new guidance acknowledges the procedure as legitimate.", "authors": ["Henry Martin For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/19/17985236-0-image-a-32_1571336342773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
