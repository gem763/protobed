Four were compromised, but they do not belong to the presidential campaign or government officials, according to the tech giant.\n\nReuters and other news media outlets reported Friday that the hackers targeted President Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMicrosoft said it notified the customers attacked and has worked with those whose accounts were compromised to secure them. It declined to disclose the names of the account holders, including the presidential campaign that had been targeted. Microsoft declined to comment beyond a blog post disclosing the news Friday.\n\nTim Murtaugh, a spokesman for President Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign, said he has \u201cno indication that any of our campaign infrastructure was targeted.\u201d Asked to clarify whether Microsoft had contacted the campaign about Iranian targeting of either the campaign or campaign personnel\u2019s personal email accounts, Murtaugh said: \u201cWe have no further comment.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just the Russians anymore as Iranians and others turn up disinformation efforts ahead of 2020 vote\n\nThe news Friday is the latest reminder that the U.S. is likely still vulnerable to security threats when it comes to the 2020 presidential election -- and not just from Russia. Analysts have seen an increase in cyber activity by Iran and its proxies in recent months targeting the United States and other countries, as tensions heightened between Iran and the west in the Persian Gulf region.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTech giants like Facebook and Twitter, as well as politicians and security officials have all made the next presidential election a priority as they race to combat hackers -- some of whom are working for foreign governments.\n\nStill, recent technology developments like increasingly realistic \u201cdeepfake\u201d or otherwise manipulated videos have many cybersecurity experts concerned about how hackers might be able to manipulate public perception.\n\nDuring the last presidential election, U.S. officials uncovered a sprawling effort backed by the Kremlin to trigger social and political unrest on major social media sites. Russian hackers also targeted Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton by hacking the emails of one of her top lieutenants, the contents of which were later dumped on Wikileaks.\n\nAD\n\nSince then, other countries have come to adopt more of Russia\u2019s playbook. Iran, for instance, for years had targeted U.S. officials through \u201clarge-scale intrusion attempts,\u201d said John Hultquist, the director of intelligence analysis at the cybersecurity firm FireEye. But it has become more aggressive recently in response to President Trump, who has imposed massive sanctions and pulled out of an international deal over the country\u2019s nuclear program, Hultquist said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe Iranians are very aggressive, and they could leverage whatever access they get for an upper hand in any kind of negotiations,\u201d Hultquist added. \u201cThey could cause a lot of mayhem.\u201d\n\nOther tech companies also have been warning about the rising Iranian threat, largely out of concern that malicious actors originating in the country were spreading disinformation online. In May, for example, Facebook and Twitter said they had removed a sprawling Iranian-based propaganda operation, including accounts that mimicked Republican congressional candidates and appeared to try to push pro-Iranian political messages on social media. Some of those accounts similarly took aim at U.S. policymakers and journalists, researchers said at the time.\n\nAD\n\nChristopher Krebs, director of DHS\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said in a statement that the agency is working with Microsoft \"to assess and mitigate impacts.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhile much of this activity can likely be attributed to run-of-the-mill foreign intelligence service work, Microsoft\u2019s claims that a presidential campaign was targeted is yet more evidence that our adversaries are looking to undermine our democratic institutions,\u201d he said in the statement. He urged Americans to be on their guard.\n\nIn June, Krebs told The Washington Post that \u201cIranian hackers and their proxies \u201care not just garden-variety run-of-the-mill data thieves,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are the guys that come in and they burn the house down.\u201d He urged companies and organizations to take computer security seriously.\n\nAD\n\nMicrosoft software is present in far more computers around the world than U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies, giving the company a broader window into the threat than government authorities.\n\nAD\n\nMicrosoft says it has found Iranian hackers targeting U.S. agencies, companies and Middle East advocates\n\nThe Democratic National Committee warned campaigns about the Phosphorus attacks Tuesday, noting that the group has been targeting personal and professional email accounts. The DNC recommended that members review logs for connection attempts in August and September.\n\n\u201cThey create believable spear phishing emails and fake LinkedIn profiles as primary tactics,\u201d according to the email from the DNC obtained by The Post. Microsoft also owns the LinkedIn professional social network.\n\nAD\n\nSpokespeople for Democratic candidates including Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.), did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Spokespeople for former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) declined to comment. Ian Sams, a spokesman for Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), said he had \u201cno indication that our campaign is the one Microsoft referenced or that we have been targeted by this attack.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTo target political and government officials\u2019 emails, Phosphorus hackers tried to figure out how to reset passwords or otherwise trigger account recovery features to take over accounts, Microsoft said. In some instances, Microsoft found that the group gathered phone numbers belonging to its targets to try to authenticate password resets.\n\nThe attacks were not \u201ctechnically sophisticated,\u201d Microsoft\u2019s vice president of customer security and trust, Tom Burt, wrote in the blog post. But he noted that they used significant amounts of the targets\u2019 personal information, suggesting that Phosphorus was willing to invest \u201csignificant time and resources engaging in research and other means of information gathering.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMicrosoft says it has found another Russian operation targeting prominent think tanks\n\nThis isn\u2019t Microsoft\u2019s first brush with Phosphorus. The company, which names hacking groups after elements on the periodic table, seized 99 websites in March it said were used by the group to launch cyberattacks against government agencies, businesses and users in Washington. Microsoft said it had been tracking the group for six years. Other researchers have tagged the group Ajax Security Team, APT 35 and Charming Kitten.\n\nAD\n\nAt the time, Microsoft said Phosphorus had targeted activists and journalists, \u201cespecially those involved in advocacy and reporting on issues related to the Middle East.\u201d\n\nPhosphorus used the websites Microsoft seized this spring to trick visitors into downloading malicious software that appeared authentic. But that was only one of the group\u2019s tactics. In Phosphorus\u2019s latest attempts, the group tried to trick users into give up codes that are used for two-factor authentication.\n\nAD\n\nThe fact that these attacks rely on social engineering, rather than technical skill, makes them particularly difficult to thwart. Tech giants can often detect digital anomalies intended to undermine email and server software. But it\u2019s much harder to use algorithms to detect phishing attempts aimed at tricking users. In May, Microsoft offered software to federal campaigns and national political committees to help prevent such breaches.\n\nAD\n\nAllison Wikoff, a researcher with Atlanta-based Secureworks who has conducted previous analysis on Phosphorus, said Microsoft\u2019s report marked the first public disclosure of attempted intrusion on a 2020 presidential campaign. It is possible, however, that similar activities have unfolded but gone unobserved, she noted.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s president chides Facebook, urges new approaches to combat weaponization of tech\n\nThe level of research that went into identifying targets, as social media and other tools become more and more central to the tactics of the suspected hackers, was particularly noteworthy, Wikoff said.\n\n\u201cThis group and other Iranian groups are very focused on the credentials of particular people of interest, whether they be U.S. government officials or people working for other types of companies that may be of strategic interest to the Iranian government,\u201d Wikoff said.\n\nIsaac Stanley-Becker contributed to this report.", "description": "The software giant said it detected a campaign linked to the Iranian government attempted to breach email addresses belonging to a U.S. presidential campaign, government officials and journalists.", "authors": ["Jay Greene", "Reporter Focused On Technology Coverage In The Pacific Northwest", "Tony Romm", "Senior Tech Policy Reporter", "Ellen Nakashima", "National Security Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2fmS8EiI8wLVTpXzhIiyjwzObWo=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/thumbnails/5d97c3bd46e0fb000970812b/2019-10-04T220530Z_1_OVAZOTNMN_RTRMADC_0_CYBER-SECURITY-IRAN.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
