They\u2019ll focus on developing the Human Landing System that will be used to achieve this goal.\n\nBlue Origin will serve as lead contractor for this new industry collaboration, which will also include Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Draper. The partnership will serve to pursue NASA\u2019s stated mission of getting the first American woman and next American man to the surface of the Moon by 2024.\n\nEach partner in this new alliance will take on specific roles pertaining to helping NASA achieve its goal. Blue Origin is going to be acting as the primary contractor and lead the program management of the partner involvement, as well as take on systems engineering, and responsibilities for safety and mission assurance. They\u2019ll also provide the descent element of the overall the human landing system, which will consist of the Blue Moon lander and the BE-7 engine that will provide its propulsion.\n\nMeanwhile, Lockheed Martin will be developing the \u2018Ascent Element\u2019 vehicle and Northrop Grumman is building the \u2018Transfer Element\u2019 to get the whole landing element Blue Origin is providing in place towards the Moon. Longtime space industry non-profit Draper will lead the descent guidance efforts and produce flight avionics.\n\n\u201cNorthrop Grumman built the original lander that now delivers cargo to ISS,\u201d Bezos said during an award ceremony at the IAC where he made the announcement. \u201cLockheed Martin is, as far as I know, the only company that actually lands on the surface of Mars. They are unbelievably competent in space. They are experts in life support systems [\u2026] and Draper is doing the guidance and control \u2013 an incredibly complex job for landing on the Moon, especially when you want to do a precision landing. And of course they did that for the original Apollo Program way back then, but today it will be done in a completely new way.\u201d", "description": "At the International Astronautical Congress in Washington, D.C. today, Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos announced a new \u201cnational team\u201d that will join forces in order to help return humans to the Moon via NASA\u2019s Artemis program.
