The company has said it expects revenue in the region to grow to 1 trillion yen by fiscal 2022 from 502.5 billion yen last year.\n\nAnother strong point last year was Uniqlo's sister brand GU, where operating profit jumped 139% to 28 billion yen. The brand was previously dismissed by some analysts as too similar to Uniqlo, but has proved popular for its more affordable and trendy items such as oversized sweatshirts.\n\n\u00a9 (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2019.", "description": "Japanese fashion group Fast Retailing Co Ltd on Thursday reported a record annual profit for a third consecutive year, helped by strong sales at its Uniqlo stores in China and strong performance of its cheaper line GU.
