I could never have imagined a thing like that in Russia, playing at the age of 15 in front of a few thousand people in Donnybrook (Stadium) and getting my photo in the newspaper the next day,\u201d Artemyev, now 32 and sporting a thick moustache, told Reuters sat amongst the empty seats at the Kobe Misaki Stadium.\n\n\u201cI blended in quite well because of rugby, as soon as I came out for the first few training sessions, it got easier. My English improved quite quickly and I was really trying to blend in, so I was trying to work on my accent as well,\u201d he says in an tone that has an unmistakable Dublin lilt to it.\n\nPlaying against Ireland\u2019s Johnny Sexton, Cian Healy and Rob Kearney in those \u201chuge\u201d school games, Artemyev made his name a few months after arriving, almost single-handedly winning the Leinster Junior Cup final with a hat-trick of scores which the Irish Times match report called \u201cone of the great schoolboy individual performances\u201d.\n\nTwo Senior Cup wins followed - one more than O\u2019Driscoll - before Artemyev played with Ireland at underage level, finished his studies and joined Northampton en route back to Russia, whom he will represent for the 89th time in Kobe.\n\nDescribing the Irish set-up as \u201clike out of a fairytale\u201d where century-old team photos cover school corridors, Artemyev, who plays on the wing, hopes Russia can build similar fundamentals after a difficult 90-year history for a sport which this World Cup could help transform.\n\n\u201cAMAZING FEELING\u201d\n\nArtemyev\u2019s time in Dublin comes in handy for McDermott when he needs to communicate with a Russian pack that have surprised many in competitive outings against Japan and Samoa.\n\nMcDermott, who coached at Irish underage level for a number of years and led his country to the 2004 Junior World Cup final, was well out of the professional game and working in telecoms in Trinidad and Tobago when, partly based on the recommendation of Italy coach Conor O\u2019Shea, he got a call out of the blue.\n\n\u201cI commute over and back. When it started it was seen maybe as a 20-24 week of the year. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever been just that in three years and this calendar year has been particularly hectic,\u201d he told Reuters.\n\n\u201cThe nature of this situation is that there are periods of time when you\u2019re gone for three, three-and-a-half weeks but then the flip side is you could be back for four weeks. It\u2019s actually easier than Trinidad when I\u2019d be gone for three to five months at a time. I\u2019ve a huge admiration for my wife and children.\u201d\n\nIreland beat Russia 62-12 in the last World Cup in which Artemyev left Kearney for dead to score a superb consolation try and the Russian captain is backing his improved side to be a far tougher opponent this time.\n\n\u201cIt was an absolutely amazing feeling having played against them in Russia\u2019s first ever World Cup,\u201d he said, recalling when he first heard about the Pool A draw.\n\n\u201cWe know Ireland have something to play for so it\u2019s a huge honour for us to be playing against a powerful and motivated Ireland side so we\u2019ll do our best to withhold their pressure and hopefully we can do some damage ourselves.\u201d\n\nStill stunned that Ireland lost to hosts Japan last week, McDermott is a little more circumspect, noting how this will only be Russia\u2019s second test against tier-one opposition since the 2011 World Cup.\n\n\u201cI just couldn\u2019t believe it and I\u2019m still a bit shocked. It\u2019s unfortunate that Russia play them next because the backlash is coming,\u201d said McDermott who, in another link to home, will face his nephew, Ireland winger Andrew Conway, on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe way they have played in the first two games has raised eyebrows and profile in Russia and that\u2019s really important for them. I want them to be competitive, go out and express what\u2019s good about Russian rugby and do it for as long as they can.\u201d", "description": "When Russia take on Ireland in Kobe on Thursday, captain Vasily Artemyev and assistant coach Mark McDermott will bring a unique insight into the team ranked 16 places above them in the world.", "authors": ["Padraic Halpin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436261816&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF91131"}
