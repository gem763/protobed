Kenneth McKenzie said the mission, which he ordered to commence from Centcom headquarters in Tampa, Fla., began around 9 a.m. Eastern Standard Time on Saturday.\n\n\"...at the compound, fighters from two locations in the vicinity of the compound began firing on U.S. aircraft participating in the assault.\"\n\n- Gen Frank McKenzie CDR USCENTCOM pic.twitter.com/SkrtHNDs7w \u2014 U.S. Central Command (@CENTCOM) October 30, 2019\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOffering new details of the raid, McKenzie spoke as reporters at the Pentagon were shown footage of the special operations team assaulting al-Baghdadi\u2019s compound and the strikes on the facility afterward.\n\nA video shows the assault force\u2019s arrival at the compound \u2013 described as an area not traditionally operated in by U.S. forces and roughly an hour flight from the U.S. staging base in Syria.\n\nFighters from two locations can be seen gathering to fire on U.S. aircraft. Though the individuals were not assessed to be affiliated with al-Baghdadi, \u201cthey demonstrated a hostile intent against U.S. forces and were killed by two airstrikes from supporting helicopters,\u201d McKenzie said as the strike was shown.\n\nThe assault force can then be seen closing in on the compound, where they first removed the none-hostile inhabitants that surrendered, which included 11 children.\n\n\u201cDespite the violent nature of the raid, and the high-profile nature of this assault, every effort was made to avoid civilian casualties and to protect the children that we suspected would be at the compound,\u201d McKenzie said.\n\nFive ISIS members inside - four woman and one man - \u201cpresented a threat to the force. They did not respond to commands in Arabic to surrender . . . and were then engaged by the raid force and killed.\u201d\n\nU.S. forces then discovered al-Baghdadi hiding in a tunnel, where he detonated a suicide vest as troops closed in, killing himself and two children, not three children as was originally assessed.\n\nMcKenzie said it\u2019s believed that al-Baghdadi fired from the tunnel in his final moments and that the two children he was with were under 12 years old.\n\nIn total, six ISIS members died during the raid. They included al-Baghdadi and one other man, and four women.\n\nAl-Baghdadi\u2019s remains were buried at sea after he was identified through DNA testing.\n\nAfterward, U.S. forces fired precision stand-off munitions from aircraft to destroy the compound, footage that was also shown to reporters.\n\n\u201cIt looks pretty much like a parking lot with large potholes right now,\u201d McKenzie said.\n\nShowing side-by-side pictures of the compound before and after the raid, McKenzie added that forces made sure the area would \u201cnot be a shrine or otherwise memorable in any way, it\u2019s just another piece of ground.\u201d\n\nIn addition, he provided some background of the now-famous dog that chased al-Baghdadi into the tunnel and was injured in the suicide vest explosion.\n\n\u201cThis dog is a four-year veteran of [Special Operations Command] canine program and has been a member of approximately 50 combat missions,\u201d McKenzie said.\n\nThe dog was injured by exposed live electrical cables in the tunnel after al-Baghdadi detonated his vest but has since been returned to duty.\n\nMcKenzie, Defense Secretary Mark Esper Mark EsperOvernight Defense: House approves Turkey sanctions in rebuke of Trump | Trump attacks on Army officer testifying spark backlash | Dems want answers from Esper over Ukraine aid House approves Turkey sanctions in rare bipartisan rebuke of Trump Democrats want answers from Pentagon chief on withheld Ukraine aid MORE and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley \u201cextensively briefed the president on all aspects of the plan and the risks involved in its execution,\u201d on Friday, McKenzie said.\n\nAsked about Trump\u2019s comments on al-Baghdadi\u2019s final moments \u2014 Trump described him as \"whimpering and crying\" and in \"panic\" as U.S. forces closed in on him \u2014 McKenzie said that he could not say where the president had heard such details.\n\n\u201cI can tell you this, he crawled into a hole with two small children and blew himself up while his people stayed on the ground. You can deduce what kind of person it is based on that activity. \u2026 I\u2019m not able to confirm anything else about his last seconds. I just can\u2019t confirm that one way or another.\u201d\n\nMilley told reporters on Monday that he assumed Trump had heard details of al-Baghdadi's last moments during the raid.\n\n\u201cI know the president had planned to talk down to the unit and unit members,\u201d Milley said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know what the source of that was. I assume it was talking directly to unit and unit members.\u201d\n\nMcKenzie also warned that though al-Baghdadi\u2019s death is a blow to ISIS, \u201cyou\u2019re never going to be able to stamp it out.\u201d\n\n\u201cISIS is first and last an ideology, so we\u2019re under no illusions that it\u2019s going to go away just because we kill Baghdadi. It will remain,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI suspect at the highest levels it\u2019ll be a little disrupted, it will take them some time to reestablish someone to lead the organization, and during that period of time their actions may be a little bit disjointed. They will be dangerous.\"\n\nHe added that national security officials suspect that ISIS will try some form of retribution attack \u201cand we are postured and prepared for that.\u201d", "description": "The Pentagon on Wednesday released new images and\u00a0video of the\u00a0weekend raid that killed the\u00a0ISIS head Abu", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/baghdadiraid_103019centcom.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
