But Trump, before leaving the White House for a South Carolina event on criminal justice reform, maintained that he has done \u201cnothing wrong\u201d in the Ukraine controversy -- and stressed the importance of the Durham probe instead.\n\nFBI AGENTS MANIPULATED FLYNN FILE, AS CLAPPER ALLEGEDLY URGED 'KILL SHOT': COURT FILING\n\n\u201cInvestigate the investigators,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s [former FBI officials Peter] Strzok and [Lisa] Page, whether it\u2019s [James] Clapper or [James] Comey, and all of these people because terrible things went on for our country.\u201d\n\nHe went on to tout Attorney General Barr as a \u201cprestigious\u201d and \u201chonorable\u201d man.\n\n\u201cI will tell you this\u2014I think you\u2019re going to see a lot of really bad things,\u201d he said. \u201cI leave it all up to the attorney general and I leave it all up to the people working with the attorney general who I don\u2019t know. I think you will see things that nobody will ever believe.\u201d\n\nTrump went on to blast the original Russia investigation as \u201cthe worst hoax in the history of our country.\u201d\n\nFox News reported on Thursday that the Durham probe has turned into a criminal investigation. One source told Fox News that Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz\u2019s forthcoming report, which will focus on alleged abuses of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), will shed light on why Durham\u2019s investigation has become a criminal inquiry.\n\nHorowitz also announced Thursday that his report would be available to the public soon, and would have few redactions.\n\nThe elevation in status for Durham\u2019s investigation is significant. The status means that the U.S. attorney from Connecticut will be able to subpoena witnesses, file charges and launch grand juries.\n\nFox News has also learned that Durham is \u201cvery interested\u201d in questioning former CIA Director John Brennan and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. According to a source familiar with the situation, Brennan has received word from his attorney that he may be contacted by Durham\u2019s office, but Clapper has received no such communication at this time.\n\nTrump and his allies have long claimed that investigators involved in the start of the Russia collusion probe were politically motivated and mishandled everything from surveillance warrants to interviews. Just this week, former national security adviser Michael Flynn's lawyer said her client's FBI interview memo was manipulated -- as he still awaits sentencing for a guilty plea of lying to investigators about contacts with Russia.\n\nBut Democrats fumed Friday over the reports on the Durham probe, accusing Barr of essentially leading a political investigation.\n\n\u201cThese reports, if true, raise profound new concerns that the Department of Justice under Attorney General William Barr has lost its independence and become a vehicle for President Trump\u2019s political revenge,\u201d said House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., in a statement.\n\nDURHAM'S INVESTIGATION INTO POSSIBLE FBI MISCONDUCT IS NOW A CRIMINAL PROBE, SOURCES SAY\n\n\u201cIf the Department of Justice may be used as a tool of political retribution or to help the President with a political narrative for the next election, the rule of law will suffer new and irreparable damage,\u201d they continued.\n\nBut House Judiciary Committee ranking member Doug Collins, R-Ga., blasted Nadler, saying that the \u201cempty accusations\u201d against Trump in the Russia investigation left Americans with \u201cunanswered questions\u201d about the FBI.\n\n\u201cChairman Nadler is wrong to suggest that John Durham\u2019s investigation is anything less than an effort to deliver truth and accountability,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cIf Mr. Durham finds that crimes were committed, I have confidence that he will pursue justice and help restore America\u2019s confidence in its premier law enforcement agency.\u201d\n\nOn the other side of the Capitol, Senate Intelligence Committee ranking member Mark Warner, D-Va., said Barr should testify.\n\n\u201cSenate Intel is wrapping up a three-year bipartisan investigation, and we\u2019ve found nothing remotely justifying this,\u201d Warner tweeted. \u201cMr. Barr\u2019s \u2018investigation\u2019 has already jeopardized key international intelligence partnerships. He needs to come before Congress and explain himself.\u201d\n\nAs part of the probe, Barr and Durham have traveled to Italy and also had conversations with law enforcement officials in the U.K. and Australia about their investigation, according to multiple sources familiar with the meetings.\n\nThe team \u201cis gathering information from numerous sources, including a number of foreign countries. At Attorney General Barr\u2019s request, the president has contacted other countries to ask them to introduce the attorney general and Mr. Durham to appropriate officials,\u201d Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said last month.\n\nThe developments coincide with the formal impeachment inquiry into the president, which began after details emerged from his highly controversial July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he pressured him to launch an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden\u2014specifically Hunter\u2019s role on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas firm and the elder Biden's role in the ouster of a prosecutor looking into the firm's founder.\n\nA whistleblower first complained about the contents of the phone call to the intelligence community inspector general in August, stating the call seemed to show the president soliciting a foreign power to help in influencing the 2020 presidential election by opening an investigation into his political opponent. This has since led to a parade of witnesses testifying behind closed doors about the president's effort to pressure Ukraine, including allegations that he held back military aid as leverage.\n\nThe White House and the president\u2019s allies have maintained there was no such quid pro quo, though a top diplomat this week provided testimony to the contrary.\n\nAs part of the House impeachment inquiry, Schiff, Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., and Oversight Committee acting Chair Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., on Friday also subpoenaed two Office of Management and Budget officials -- Associate Director for National Security Programs Michael Duffey and Acting Director Russel Voight -- for depositions next month.\n\nThe chairs on Friday also notified State Department Counselor T. Ulrich Brechbuhl of a subpoena compelling his testimony next month.\n\n\u201cYour failure or refusal to appear at the deposition, including at the direction or behest of the President or the White House, shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry and may be used as an adverse inference against the President,\u201d the Democratic lawmakers wrote in their letter to Brechbuhl.\n\nFox News' Ed Henry and Gregg Re contributed to this report.", "description": "President Trump said Friday it\u2019s time to \u201cinvestigate the investigators,\u201d after it was revealed that\u00a0U.S. Attorney John Durham\u2019s review of alleged misconduct at the Justice Department in the run-up to the 2016 election has turned into a full-fledged criminal probe.", "authors": ["Brooke Singman", "Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News.
