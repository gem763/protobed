The US has also imposed sanctions on Turkey's defence and energy ministries, as well as the ministers of defence, energy and interior.\n\nMeanwhile, Syria's army - which has done a deal with Kurdish-led forces - has entered the area, prompting concerns that it could become involved in a confrontation with Turkey. Reports say dozens of civilians have been killed so far and up to 160,000 people have been displaced. Here is the situation they are facing.\n\nTurkey's offensive began last week after Mr Trump removed dozens of US troops from north-east Syria. But Vice-President Mike Pence said this did not give the \"green light\" for the actions against Syrian Kurds, who are America's ally. We analyse the effect Mr Trump's actions have had.\n\nAnd will the situation allow Islamic State to re-emerge?\n\nBulgaria-England match halted twice due to racist abuse\n\nEngland's men's football team beat Bulgaria 6-0 last night, to put them close to qualifying for the Euro 2020 finals. But the match in Sofia had to be halted twice because of racist behaviour, including the chanting of monkey noises and giving Nazi salutes. \"Not an easy situation to play in and not one which should be happening in 2019,\" tweeted forward Marcus Rashford.\n\nBulgaria's coach said he hadn't heard any racist chanting. But England defender Tyrone Mings said the abuse had been \"as clear as day\".\n\nHere is our report on the match.\n\nGet news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning\n\nBrexit: EU ministers to be updated as talks continue\n\nIn two days' time EU heads of government meet in an attempt to reach a Brexit deal. Talks between officials have intensified and chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier is due to update EU ministers meeting in Luxembourg later today.\n\nBBC Europe editor Katya Adler gives her thoughts on whether a deal - which would then need to be agreed to by MPs on Saturday if it is to be in place by the 31 October Brexit deadline - is possible in such a short time.\n\nSir Elton John: I still want my dad's approval\n\nBy Mark Savage, entertainment reporter\n\nHe may have started out singing cover versions on cheap compilation albums, but Elton John went on to become the fifth-highest-selling recording artist of all time. He was the first musician to enter the US album charts at number one. He has won a Brit award for outstanding achievement three times. And his tribute single for Princess Diana, Candle In The Wind, has sold 33 million copies worldwide.\n\nNone of this, however, impressed his father. Stanley Dwight, a flight lieutenant in the Royal Air Force, never attended one of Elton's shows, and never expressed pride in his son's success. Their relationship was strained until his death from heart disease in 1991.\n\nRead the full article\n\nWhat the papers say\n\nThere is disgust at the racist abuse of England players and staff in the match against Bulgaria. The Daily Mirror calls the team \"heroes\" for the way they dealt with it, while the Sun shows some Bulgaria fans making Nazi salutes. Meanwhile, the Times says MPs are \"all but certain\" to reject the government's legislative programme, laid out in Monday's Queen's Speech. But the Daily Telegraph reports that Boris Johnson could be edging towards a Brexit deal, with sources on both sides expressing \"cautious optimism\".\n\nDaily digest\n\nExtinction Rebellion Police impose London-wide ban on protests\n\nVoter ID Plans discriminate against ethnic minorities, says Corbyn\n\nVaping Children illegally sold e-cigarettes, report finds\n\nBill Turnbull Broadcaster backs cannabis for medicinal use\n\nIf you see one thing today\n\nViewpoint: We need to stop the schizophrenia stigma\n\nIf you listen to one thing today\n\nWomen working in war zones\n\nIf you read one thing today\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nWho gets the tips in a restaurant?\n\nSign up for a morning briefing direct to your phone\n\nLookahead\n\n09:30 UK unemployment figures for the three months to August are released.\n\n09:30 The Commons Treasury Committee hears evidence on the Bank of England's financial stability report.\n\nOn this day\n\n1969 Millions of Americans take part in marches protesting against the Vietnam war.
