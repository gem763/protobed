The Milk Marketing Board had sent me up to Newcastle for a campaign, and the Stones happened to be staying at the same hotel. We\u2019d just been to their concert, and were having a late dinner. They were sitting next to us. Various women were coming up to Mick Jagger and asking for his autograph. So my girlfriend, Julie \u2013 who became my wife of 55 years \u2013 went over, but she didn\u2019t even get a chance to ask, because Mick just waved her away saying: \u201cNo, love, you\u2019re too young.\u201d I had my camera ready, but unfortunately I didn\u2019t take a picture. That would have been fantastic, Mick waving his arms around.\n\nThe next morning, the band were lounging around in the hotel foyer. To their evident annoyance I got my camera out and was about to snap them, but then their car arrived and they left before they had a chance to say to me: \u201cWho do you think you are?\u201d When I got chosen to do their album cover I was dreading the thought that Mick was going to recognise me, so I had my hair cut much shorter and changed my clothing.\n\nI was known for doing group scenes \u2013 a shoot with up to 50 people became known as a \u201cMichael Joseph\u201d in the business \u2013 and my early shot of a boardroom for a White Horse whisky ad in 1965 had been used as a giant poster all over England. That was what got me the Beggars Banquet job. The shoot location was wonderful, up in Sarum Chase, in Hampstead, north London, where Frank O Salisbury, the Victorian society painter, had lived and worked.\n\nBrian Jones was very happy playing with a labrador. Charlie Watts was chatting up the stuffed monkey\n\nThe caretaker there \u2013 a very careful, grey-haired man \u2013 said: \u201cSo this is for the Rolling Stones?\u201d I said: \u201cYes, I\u2019m afraid they\u2019re a bit wild.\u201d He said: \u201cNo, that\u2019s not a problem. But I\u2019m a bit worried. Will there be any naked ladies?\u201d And I said: \u201cNo, it\u2019ll just be the band. Why, what\u2019s the problem with naked ladies?\u201d And he told me: \u201cWell, for naked ladies, we charge \u00a310 extra.\u201d\n\nThe 1961 film Viridiana, directed by Luis Bu\u00f1uel \u2013 which has a famous scene of beggars at a banquet \u2013 was probably in the mind of Mike Peters, the art director. There\u2019s meant to be a look of decadence about the photo. That word sums up the era. The swinging 60s was considered a period where people did what they liked.\n\nThe Stones arrived punctually. They were impressed with my lighting setup, and this fantastic, beautiful room. I was already there, talking through a megaphone to the goats, dogs and all the other animals we had for the shoot, getting them to understand what it was all about. I was good with animals and they behaved very nicely. Most of the feast on the table was prop food, but luckily, I\u2019d put down a bowl of real cherries, and the goat was munching away on those. There were some cats knocking around the set, too, and they didn\u2019t seem to be put off by 20,000 joules of light flashing away.\n\nWe only had two hours for the whole session, so literally within 10 minutes, the band were all changed. They just put on whatever costume they fancied and we didn\u2019t bother with makeup \u2013 it wasn\u2019t necessary. I put Keith Richards in the centre of the photo because he was the best-looking and the youngest. Bill Wyman, not so good-looking, so we put him further back. On the right, Brian Jones was very happy playing with a labrador. Charlie Watts was chatting up the stuffed monkey that\u2019s on the table. Mick was happy to be centre-stage, standing on the table, cuddling some of the animals. There were other shots from this session where he\u2019s holding a baby eagle, but then he got bored with that.\n\nThe Rolling Stones \u2013 every album ranked! Read more\n\nBrian had been busted the night before. The police knew the band were smoking drugs, so they\u2019d raided his place, but didn\u2019t find anything. So he wasn\u2019t actually arrested, but he was a bit subdued for the whole shoot. I obviously didn\u2019t bring it up. Presumably, they\u2019d been out drinking all the night before, but none of them even brought a cup of coffee in to the shoot.\n\nThe band were very well-behaved and it all went like clockwork. My girlfriend was also at the shoot and at the end of the session, Mick came up to me and said: \u201cYou and your bird can come in my limo up to Swarkestone\u201d \u2013 where we were doing more pictures for the album. But I never had any dealings with the Stones after that.\n\n\u2022 Best of Proud is at London\u2019s Proud Galleries until 27 October, featuring rare shots of JFK, David Bowie, Mick Jagger and more, by photographers Michael Joseph, Brian Duffy and Norman Seeff.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Always keep a camera handy, every minute of your living day\u2019 \u2026 Michael Joseph whose shot of the rolling stones for Beggars Banquet.
