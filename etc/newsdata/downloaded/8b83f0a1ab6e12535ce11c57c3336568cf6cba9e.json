In some games, players can be finished by 23 as their reactions slow.\n\nPlayers from nine countries will compete in six titles at the SEA Games \u2014 Mobile Legends, Arena of Valor, Dota 2, Starcraft II, Tekken 7, and Hearthstone.\n\nSupporters hope the tournament could be a step towards a spot at the Olympics although that seems unlikely any time soon, with the venerable institution so far unenthusiastic about the discipline.\n\nPlayers who cut short their education and made a success of eSports say their families have, for the most part, accepted their choice \u2014 although they stress they are not encouraging other gamers to follow their lead.\n\nKang used to be part of a team in the United States, where his accommodation was paid for and he received a salary and prize money. He currently plays for a Thailand-based team.\n\n\u201cEventually they (my parents) were convinced,\u201d he said. \u201cI could pay for my own food, live on my own.\u201d\n\nburs-sr/qan", "description": "Singapore (AFP) \u2013 In a country highly focused on academic achievement, Singaporean Galvin Kang Jian Wen did something almost unthinkable \u2014 he", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/05/ae4983_teenage-gamers-worldwide-are-shunning-mainstream-education-booming-esports-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
