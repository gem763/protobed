WarnerMedia's offering is banking on the HBO brand, and building on it with original series and programming from Warner Bros. and DC. And NBCUniversal is looking to its library programming for its streaming complement to parent company Comcast's cable service.\n\nHere's everything we know about these services so far. Business Insider will continue to cover them as plans develop.\n\nDisney Plus\n\nDisney\n\nDisney will be the first out of the gate with the November launch of its family-friendly streaming service, Disney Plus.\n\nThe platform will rely heavily on flagship Disney brands, including Marvel, Star Wars, and Pixar, as well as National Geographic, which Disney recently acquired along with other assets from 21st Century Fox.\n\nDisney is leveraging Marvel, in particular, to get the streaming service off the ground. It's making Marvel series exclusively for Disney Plus that will be pivotal to the plots of future films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which has grossed more than $22 billion at the box office across 23 movies.\n\nDisney Plus will also have a robust collection of Disney films, which could make it indispensable to parents.\n\nThe service will be available for a subscription fee, and will not include advertising.\n\nDisney said it will bundle Disney Plus at launch with its sports hub ESPN Plus and the ad-supported version of Hulu, which is Disney's newly controlled home for adult programming.\n\nThe company plans to start marketing Disney Plus in August, and offer attendees to its biannual fan convention, D23, first access to the platform.\n\nLaunch date: November 12, 2019 (US, Canada, and the Netherlands); November 19, 2019 (Australia and New Zealand)\n\nPrice:\n\n$6.99 per month, or $69.99 per year\n\n$12.99 per month for bundle including Disney Plus, ESPN Plus, and Hulu with ads\n\nProgramming highlights: Star Wars spinoff \"The Mandalorian\"; Marvel series \"The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,\" \"WandaVision,\" \"Loki,\" \"Hawkeye,\" and \"What If...\"; Disney Channel spinoffs like \"High School Musical: The Musical: The Series\"; new and old releases from Disney's movie studios, as the rights becomes available, like \"Avengers: Endgame\" and \"The Lion King.\"\n\nRead more about Disney's streaming strategy:\n\nHBO Max\n\nAssociated Press\n\nWith Disney leaning on family-friendly franchises, AT&T's WarnerMedia appears to be going all-in on its adult network HBO.\n\nThe company's upcoming streaming service will be called HBO Max. It will feature programming from HBO, as well as other WarnerMedia brands like Warner Bros., DC Entertainment, TBS, TNT, and CNN. HBO Max will have original series and movies, some of which may tie into WarnerMedia titles off of the platform. The series, \"Dune: Sisterhood,\" for example, is based on Frank Herbert's \"Dune\" universe, which Warner Bros. is also adapting for film.\n\nHBO Max will have a back catalog of old Warner Bros. movies and TV shows, like \"Friends\" and \"The Fresh Prince of Bel Air,\" as well, to keep subscribers interested in between new releases. It also has a licensing deal with BBC Studios to stream \"Doctor Who\" and other shows on the service.\n\nUnlike Netflix, HBO Max will also have live sports and news, though likely not at launch.\n\n\"You should assume that, ultimately, HBO Max will have live elements,\" Randall Stephenson, chairman and CEO of AT&T, said on the company's second quarter conference call. \"Those live elements \u2014 both unique live sports, premium sports, the ones we just went through, NBA, Major League Baseball, NCAA basketball \u2014 those are going to be really, really important elements for HBO Max. The same with news.\"\n\nWarnerMedia has talked about a few different business models for HBO Max. At launch, it's expected to be available for a subscription fee, and without ads. Some programming, such as the live sports and news, will probably feature advertising down the line.\n\nUS launch date: Spring 2020\n\nPrice: TBD; likely more than the $14.99 per month that HBO Now costs\n\nProgramming highlights: Original shows \"Dune: Sisterhood\"; \"Love Life,\" a romantic comedy starring Anna Kendrick; an animated \"Gremlins\" series, and a revival of \"Gossip Girl.\" Upcoming HBO programming like Stephen King's \"The Outsider\"; \"The Undoing,\" from David E.
