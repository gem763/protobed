His famous law asserts that whatever can go wrong, will. Well, things sometimes actually can go right.\n\nStocks rallied this past week, breaking their three-week losing streak, while the bond market\u2019s much-feared economic barometer flipped to positive from negative. Progress appeared in an apparent de-escalation of the U.S.-China trade war. At the same time, global economic policies have turned from a headwind to a tailwind. Even the seemingly unending drag from Brexit might finally be coming to a less-than-disastrous end. Take that, Murphy!\n\nRelated Data Market Data Center: Bonds\n\nOK, not everything\u2019s perfect on the geopolitical front (Turkey, Hong Kong) or back at home (impeachment, et cetera), but stocks surged on Friday in anticipation of what President Donald Trump described as a \u201cvery substantial phase one deal\u201d with China, including a suspension of tariffs slated to take effect on Tuesday. That capped a 0.9% weekly advance in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite and a 0.6% gain in the S&P 500 index.\n\nGood news was bad news for bond prices, and that sent yields sharply higher. But the more important result was that the dark cloud of an inverted yield curve was removed, as the benchmark 10-year note\u2019s yield rose to 1.75%, above the 1.68% on the three-month bill. The significance is twofold: The rise in longer-term yields means that investors no longer are panicking to lock in returns before a recession pulls them lower. And policy makers have pushed down short-term rates to stave off a downturn.\n\nGlobal growth expectations, recently depressed, are apt to improve, observes Cornerstone Macro. That\u2019s just as stimulus from the decline in interest rates\u2014including 45 central bank cuts in the past six months\u2014kicks in, along with fiscal and monetary measures taken by China. The global easing cycle suggests that the third \u201cmini-recession\u201d of the decadelong expansion should bottom soon, notes Evercore ISI.\n\nFriday\u2019s announcement of progress in the U.S.-China tiff \u201cis likely a reflection and recognition that both economies are slowing and would benefit from a de-escalation of trade tensions,\u201d writes Stephen Pavlick, Washington policy analyst at Renaissance Macro Research. \u201cDe-escalation is different from a deal,\u201d he avers, so it\u2019s important to watch what happens from here. The practical import to investors is that stocks have overtaken bonds for this year. Through Friday, the SPDR S&P 500 exchange-traded fund (ticker: SPY) was up 18.5% for the year, while the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) was up 15.6%. At the end of July, the bond ETF was leading the stock ETF by about 20% to 8%. Fearing the worst, investors this year have poured $379 billion into bond funds and yanked $217 billion from equity funds, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. In the past week, investors added $11.1 billion to bond funds and pulled $9.8 billion from stocks.\n\nMore Up & Down Wall Street The Long Rally in Bonds Might Be Near Its End\n\nWhether the downbeat sentiment implied by those flows is justified will be tested by third-quarter earnings reports, which will start arriving in earnest this coming week. Even more telling will be managements\u2019 outlook for future quarters. It may be too soon for recent positive developments to be reflected in their expectations. Still, the markets may anticipate Murphy being proved wrong.\n\nWrite to Randall W.
