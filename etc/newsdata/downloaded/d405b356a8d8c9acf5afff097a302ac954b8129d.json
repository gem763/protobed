Back in 2013 Dish lost out in a bidding war with SoftBank for control of Sprint.\n\nSo it's not surprising that Sprint and T-Mobile are looking in Dish's direction, nor that regulators see it as a potential way to avoid admitting the deal will reduce competition.\n\nBe smart: Even if the DoJ signs off on the deal, several states have already sued to block the merger, so they would have to be persuaded as well.\n\nAnd many experts doubt that Dish alone will be a significant rival.\n\nIt's not so much a question of \"Can Dish compete?\" but rather whether it has the stomach to do so, New Street Research argued in a report Wednesday.\n\nIf they build a low-cost network, the firm argues, such a network can probably get customers. But whether Dish has the interest or skill to really build a network is far from certain.\n\nEven if Dish does build a network, wireless consultant Chetan Sharma predicted that it won't want to be in the business for the long haul. Instead Dish would look to run it for a few years and ideally sell it back to one of the big three operators.", "description": "Regulators want Dish to keep 4-way mobile competition alive, but the firm might not be able to fill the role.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/Ug8sxDkBPHV7Gb_xmN2ssLm588U=/0x864:4608x3456/1920x1080/2019/07/25/1564064071217.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-25"}
