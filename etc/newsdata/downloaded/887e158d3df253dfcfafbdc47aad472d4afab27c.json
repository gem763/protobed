Happy anniversary, Bill!\u201d Hillary wrote on Friday night, sharing a photo of the couple dressed to the nines on a red carpet.\n\nBill responded just as sweetly, tweeting a retro photo of him and his wife on their wedding day. \u201cAnd after forty four years I\u2019m still looking up to you, as happy today as I was then,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe power couple met at Yale Law School in 1970 and began dating one year later. They wed on October 11, 1975, at their Fayetteville, Arkansas home. According to Biography, prior to the proposal, Bill bought the home in secret after Hillary noted her appreciation. The moment they became engaged, Bill told Hillary she was a homeowner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForty-four years later, and he still cleans up pretty well.\n\n\n\nHappy anniversary, Bill! pic.twitter.com/T4Emcah1r8 \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 11, 2019\n\nAnd after forty four years I\u2019m still looking up to you, as happy today as I was then. pic.twitter.com/cplH2kxHOf \u2014 Bill Clinton (@BillClinton) October 12, 2019\n\nIn 2015, Bill told Time that he worked hard to convince Hillary to settle down. \u201cI asked her to marry me three times before she said yes,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the first time I said, \u2018I want you to marry me but you shouldn\u2019t do it.\u2019\u201d\n\nInstead, Bill told his future wife to pursue a political career. Bill said Hillary replied, \u201cOh my God \u2026 I\u2019ll never run for office. I\u2019m too aggressive, and nobody will ever vote for me.\u201d\n\nThat year, Hillary told Lena Dunham why she hesitated to marry the two-term president. \"I was terrified about losing my identity and getting lost in the kind of wake of Bill's force-of-nature personality. I actually turned him down twice when he asked me to marry him. He asked, we were in England on a trip after law school graduation. He asked me to marry him. I said, 'You know, I can't say yes. No, I can't do that right now.' And then, about a year later he asked me again, and I said 'No.' He said, 'Well, I'm not asking you again until you're ready to say yes.' And that was a large part of the ambivalence and the worry that I wouldn't necessarily know who I was or what I could do if I got married to someone who was going to chart a path that he was incredibly clear about.\"\n\nRecently, Hillary said staying married to Bill was her \u201cgutsiest\u201d move yet during an appearance on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d to promote her new project, The Gutsy Book of Women, co-written with daughter Chelsea Clinton. Answering a direct question on the topic, Hillary said, \"I think the gutsiest thing I\u2019ve ever done, well, personally, [is] make the decision to stay in my marriage.\u201d\n\nIn the 1990s, while president, Bill had an affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky, which lead to his 1998 impeachment. Bill was acquitted and continued serving in office but the scandal rocked his presidency.\n\nHillary expanded on her answer by telling GMA, \"Publicly, politically, run for president and keep going. Just get up every day and keep going.\"\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "The couple of 44 years wished each other a happy anniversary on social media.", "authors": ["Elise Sol\u00e9"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eaaND0fRV6DzYIvJjvR4DQ--~B/aD0xOTQ5O3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/67342200-ed05-11e9-af37-b90b1d0f2247", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
