Peacock fired the ball to Astros first baseman Yuli Gurriel, but it struck Turner as he made his move to get to the base.\n\nFirst, the play:\n\nTrea Turner was called out on this play. \"That's a potentially series changing call.\" \u2013 Joe @Buck pic.twitter.com/E3Po7hSNcR \u2014 FOX Sports: MLB (@MLBONFOX) October 30, 2019\n\nAftermath:\n\nI just want to point out that this meltdown happened during \"Take Me Out To The Ballgame\" which is not clear on the Fox broadcast, and it's hilarious pic.twitter.com/pHFJwSmLMQ \u2014 Timothy Burke (@bubbaprog) October 30, 2019\n\nMartinez became the first manager to be ejected from a World Series game since Braves Manager Bobby Cox got tossed during the 1996 World Series.\n\n\u201cEven though first base is in fair territory, the runner is required to run in the lane in foul territory. Turner was just inside the foul line \u2014 although the rule raises the question of where exactly Turner is supposed to run on his final step to the bag,\u201d ESPN reports.\n\n\u201cFor me, I mean, what else do you do?\u201d Turner said. \u201cI don\u2019t know. The batter\u2019s box is in fair territory. First base is in fair territory. I swung, I ran in a straight line, I got hit with the ball and I\u2019m out. I don\u2019t understand it.\u201d\n\nMLB Chief Baseball Officer Joe Torre delivered an explanation that didn\u2019t help most people understand the call any better. Torre claims that the call was correct and in any event, was a judgment call and not subject to review.\n\n\u201cTorre said Turner was called out because he interfered with Gurriel trying to catch the ball by running into Gurriel\u2019s glove. He went on to say that had Turner run in the proper lane outside the foul line, he could have avoided hitting Gurriel\u2019s glove. Torre did not say what would have happened had Turner run in the proper lane and still hit Gurriel\u2019s glove,\u201d ESPN reports.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a judgment call on the umpire,\u201d Torre claims. \u201cSam Holbrook made the call. It was the right call. Of course, then you watch Davey Martinez, and I can relate to that. When you wear a uniform, you know what you want to have happen, basically.\u201d\n\nIn any event, Washington\u2019s Anthony Rendon came on after the play and hit a home run which made the potentially series altering call, not decisive. MLB is probably pretty happy Rendon hit that home run.\n\nFollow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn", "description": "Washington Nationals Manager Dave Martinez was ejected in the 7th inning of Game 6 of the World Series, after arguing a controversial", "authors": ["Dylan Gwinn"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AP-Photo_Matt-Slocum2-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
