The blocked complaint is both \u201cserious\u201d and \u201curgent,\u201d the government\u2019s intelligence watchdog said.\n\nThe administration is keeping Congress from even learning what exactly the whistleblower is alleging, but the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general said the matter involves the \u201cmost significant\u201d responsibilities of intelligence leadership. One report said it involved a promise Trump made in a phone call to a foreign leader. A lawmaker said the complaint was \u201cbased on a series of events.\u201d\n\nThe inspector general appeared before the House intelligence committee behind closed doors Thursday but declined, under administration orders, to reveal to members the substance of the complaint.\n\nThe standoff raises fresh questions about the extent to which Trump\u2019s allies are protecting the president from oversight and, specifically, if his new acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, is working with the Justice Department to shield the president from the reach of Congress.\n\nTrump, though giving no details about any incident, denied Thursday that he would ever \u201csay something inappropriate\u201d on such a call.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said he was prepared to go to court to try to force the Trump administration to open up about the complaint.\n\n\u201cThe inspector general has said this cannot wait,\u201d said Schiff, describing the administration\u2019s blockade as an unprecedented departure from law. \u201cThere\u2019s an urgency here that I think the courts will recognize.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post reported the complaint involves an intelligence official\u2019s allegation that Trump made a promise to an unidentified foreign leader in a telephone call. The Post cited two anonymous former U.S. officials.\n\nThe Associated Press has not confirmed the report.\n\nSchiff said he, too, could not confirm whether the Post report was accurate because the administration was claiming executive privilege in withholding the complaint. But letters from the inspector general to the committee released Thursday said it was an \u201curgent\u201d matter of \u201cserious or flagrant abuse\u201d that must be shared with lawmakers.\n\nThe letters also made it clear that Trump\u2019s new acting director of national intelligence, Maguire, consulted with the Justice Department in deciding not to transmit the complaint to Congress in a further departure from standard procedure. It\u2019s unclear whether the White House was also involved, Schiff said.\n\nBecause the administration is claiming the information is privileged, Schiff said he believes the whistleblower\u2019s complaint \u201clikely involves the president or people around him.\u201d\n\nTrump dismissed it all.\n\n\u201cAnother Fake News story out there - It never ends!\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cVirtually anytime I speak on the phone to a foreign leader, I understand that there may be many people listening from various U.S. agencies, not to mention those from the other country itself. No problem!\u201d\n\nHe asked: \u201cIs anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially \u2018heavily populated\u2019 call.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats are fighting the administration separately for access to witnesses and documents in impeachment probes. This new situation has led to their public concerns that government intelligence agencies and the recently named acting director might be under pressure to withhold information from Congress.\n\nTrump tapped Maguire, a former Navy official, as acting intelligence director in August, after the departure of Director Dan Coats, a former Republican senator who often clashed with the president, and the retirement of Sue Gordon, a career professional in the No. 2 position.\n\nMaguire has refused to discuss details of the whistleblower complaint, but he has been subpoenaed by the House panel and is expected to testify publicly next Thursday. Both Maguire and the inspector general, Michael Atkinson, are also expected next week at the Senate intelligence committee.\n\nAtkinson wrote in letters that Schiff released Thursday that he and Maguire had hit an \u201cimpasse\u201d over the acting director\u2019s decision not to share the complaint with Congress.\n\nWhile Atkinson wrote that he believed Maguire\u2019s position was in \u201cgood faith\u201d it did not appear to be consistent with past practice. Atkinson said he was told by the legal counsel for the intelligence director that the complaint did not actually meet the definition of an \u201curgent concern.\u201d And he said the Justice Department said it did not fall under the director\u2019s jurisdiction because it did not involve an intelligence professional.\n\nAtkinson said he disagreed with that Justice Department view. The complaint \u201cnot only falls under DNI\u2019s jurisdiction,\u201d Atkinson wrote, \u201cbut relates to one of the most significant and important of DNI\u2019s responsibilities to the American people.\u201d\n\nThe inspector general went on to say he requested authorization to at the very least disclose the \u201cgeneral subject matter\u201d to the committee, but had not been allowed to do so. He said the information was \u201cbeing kept\u201d from Congress. These decisions, the inspector general said, are affecting his execution of his duties and responsibilities.\n\nIllinois Rep. Mike Quigley, a member of the panel, said Atkinson said that the complaint was \u201cbased on a series of events.\u201d\n\nIn calling the inspector general to testify, Schiff said Atkinson determined the whistleblower complaint was \u201ccredible and urgent\u201d and should be \u201ctransmitted to Congress.\u201d\n\nThe inspector general\u2019s testimony was described by three people with knowledge of the proceedings. They were not authorized to discuss the meeting by name and were granted anonymity.\n\nSeveral lawmakers suggested the failure to disclose the complaint\u2019s contents amounted to a failure to protect the whistleblower, another violation. However, the general counsel for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Jason Klitenic, wrote in a letter Tuesday to the committee that the agency was indeed protecting the whistleblower.\n\nAndrew Bakaj, a former intelligence officer and an attorney specializing in whistleblower reprisal investigations, confirmed that he was representing the whistleblower but declined further comment.\n\nRep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., said on MSNBC that the acting director \u201cbroke the law when he decided to basically intercept the inspector general\u2019s report to Congress.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s \u201cnever been done before in the history of inspector general reports to the Congress,\u201d Himes said. \u201cAnd the American people should be worried about that.\u201d\n\nHimes said, \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly what is in the substance of this complaint. It could be nothing. It could be something very, very serious.\u201d", "description": "The Trump administration plunged into an extraordinary showdown with Congress on Thursday over access to a whistleblower\u2019s reported complaint about incidents...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ717_19trum_ZG_20190904201152.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
