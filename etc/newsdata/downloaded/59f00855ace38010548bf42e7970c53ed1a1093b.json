Mandatory credit Kyodo/via REUTERS\n\nAuthorities lifted rain and flood warnings for the Kanto region around a becalmed Tokyo before dawn as the typhoon plowed up Japan\u2019s northeast coast. Warnings for areas north of the capital began to be lifted by Sunday morning.\n\nTyphoon Hagibis was expected to head out to sea on Sunday evening after churning its way up the northern island of Hokkaido.\n\nSeven people were killed in areas including the Chiba, Gunma, Kanagawa and Fukushima prefectures surrounding Tokyo, NHK said. Among them was a man in his 60s who was found in a flooded apartment in Kawasaki, it said. Fifteen people were also missing early on Sunday, it said.\n\nMillions of people had been warned earlier to evacuate.\n\nSome 425,000 homes were without power, the government said, reviving fears of a repeat of the weeks-long power outages suffered after another typhoon hit east of Tokyo last month.\n\nIn Fukushima, north of the capital, Tokyo Electric Power Co reported irregular readings from sensors monitoring water in its Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant overnight. The plant was crippled by a 2011 earthquake and tsunami.\n\nHeavy rain caused rivers to flood their banks in parts of Fukushima and Nagano prefectures, submerging houses and rice paddies and forcing some people to climb onto their roofs for safety.\n\nHouses along the Chikuma river in Nagano were nearly under water and at least one person was rescued from the roof of a house by helicopter, NHK said. Part of a road was swept away in flooding.\n\nAuthorities issued evacuation advisories and orders for more than 6 million people across Japan as the storm unleashed the heaviest rain and winds in years. Some 100 injuries have been reported so far, NHK said.\n\nMORE FLOODING POSSIBLE\n\nThe storm, which the government said could be the strongest to hit Tokyo since 1958, brought record-breaking rainfall in many areas, including the popular resort town of Hakone, which was hit with 939.5 mm (37 inches) of rain over 24 hours.\n\nHagibis, which means \u201cspeed\u201d in the Philippine language Tagalog, made landfall on Japan\u2019s main island of Honshu on Saturday evening. A magnitude 5.7 earthquake shook Tokyo shortly after.\n\nMajor shinkansen bullet trains from Tokyo would begin on schedule Sunday, NHK said, while the Tokyo subway system was also operating.\n\nOne expert, Nobuyuki Tsuchiya, director of the Japan Riverfront Research Center, had earlier told Reuters that further flooding could occur as several surrounding prefectures began releasing water from dams, letting it flow downstream.\n\nAbout 1.5 million people in Tokyo live below sea level.\n\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency had issued the highest alert level for 12 prefectures, warning of the potential for once-in-decades rain totals, but lifted them early on Sunday.\n\nJust last month, another strong storm, Typhoon Faxai, destroyed or damaged 30,000 houses in Chiba, east of Tokyo, and caused extensive power outages.\n\nThe capital\u2019s main airports, Haneda and Narita, stopped flights from landing and connecting trains were suspended, forcing the cancellation of more than a thousand flights.\n\nMany people in and around Tokyo took shelter in temporary evacuation facilities before the worst of the storm arrived.\n\nYuka Ikemura, a 24-year-old nursery school teacher, was in one such facility at a community center in eastern Tokyo with her 3-year-old son, 8-month-old daughter and their pet rabbit.\n\nShe said she decided to move before it was too late.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got small children to take care of and we live on the first floor of an old apartment,\u201d Ikemura told Reuters.\n\n\u201cWe brought with us the bare necessities. I\u2019m scared to think about when we will have run out diapers and milk.\u201d\n\nThe Rugby World Cup match between Namibia and Canada in Kamaishi on Sunday was canceled, although the crucial Japan-Scotland match was set to go ahead. Two matches were canceled on Saturday.\n\nFormula One Grand Prix organizers had also canceled all practice and qualifying sessions scheduled for Saturday.", "description": "Seven people were killed and 15 were missing after the most powerful typhoon to hit Japan in decades paralyzed Tokyo, flooding rivers and leaving almost half a million homes without power, public broadcaster NHK reported on Sunday.", "authors": ["Makiko Yamazaki", "Kiyoshi Takenaka", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191013&t=2&i=1440208634&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9C004-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
