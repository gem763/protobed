After it failed to sell its stock to the public last month, throwing its funding plans into disarray, the company was bailed out Tuesday by SoftBank, its largest outside investor.\n\nSoftBank\u2019s takeover values WeWork, which leases office space to co-working tenants, at about US$7 billion. That is a far cry from the US$47 billion that the company was valued at in January.\n\nWeWork, which is based in New York, might be the most extreme example of the rebuke that public stock investors have delivered to high-flying startups, but it is hardly alone.\n\nAcross Wall Street, in Silicon Valley and at some of the world\u2019s largest companies, a reckoning is unfolding as valuations slide for the so-called unicorns \u2014 startups worth at least US$1 billion \u2014 that everyone was once so eager to buy.\n\nSince going public this spring, Lyft and Uber have shed about US$40 billion in market value and are trading well below their private market valuation. SmileDirectClub is trading at about half of its IPO price, and Peloton about 23 per cent below its debut.\n\nAnd since 2011, one-third of startups valued at US$1 billion or more priced their IPOs below where they were in their last round of private fundraising, according to data provider PitchBook. A year later, nearly 40 per cent of the unicorns that have gone public are valued at less than their final private market value.\n\nEven before WeWork was bailed out, its struggle to go public had caused some of its early investors to write down the value of their holdings. In recent weeks, Goldman Sachs and Jefferies, a smaller investment bank, reduced the value of their stakes in WeWork by about US$80 million and US$146 million during the third quarter. Both investments remained profitable at the end of the third quarter.\n\nAnd those who bought shares of some of the most valuable startups during later funding rounds are in many cases underwater. A 2017 investment in Lyft by mutual fund giant Fidelity valued the company\u2019s stock at about US$47.35, according to EquityZen, a marketplace for private stocks, while Toyota\u2019s investment in rival Uber last year valued that company\u2019s stock at US$48.77.\n\nOn Friday Lyft\u2019s stock closed at US$44.54, while Uber\u2019s ended the day at US$32.71.\n\nAll of this is fallout from an investment bubble that had formed in the private markets that fund startups, as big investors with billions of dollars piled in. Behind this wave of investment was a change in rules on private investments, record-low interest rates and a fear of missing out on the next transformational tech company like Google or Amazon.\n\nFund companies including Fidelity and T. Rowe Price, which had typically invested only in public companies, started taking part in private funding rounds \u2014 and so-called megafunds, which could make huge bets on a single firm, most notably SoftBank, were born.\n\nSoon the sums raised in private markets were dwarfing the money from IPOs. Over the past six years, companies have raised about US$550 billion from venture capital funds, easily exceeding the US$320 billion of proceeds generated from IPOs over that period, according to data from PitchBook and Dealogic.\n\nBut the private money meant companies could grow without the scrutiny of public market investors \u2014 no quarterly financial updates or demands for proof that they would find a way to become profitable. Now that they are moving into the glare, it has become evident that a number are still far from being ready to live up to the market\u2019s demands.\n\n\u201cThese companies are still not mature,\u201d said Kathleen Smith, principal at Renaissance Capital, which provides research on IPOs and manages exchange-traded funds that track their performance. \u201cMaturity isn\u2019t measured by the number of years you have been around. It\u2019s measured by whether you can earn money. That\u2019s maturity.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "WeWork might be the most extreme example of the rebuke that public stock investors have delivered to high-flying startups, but it is hardly alone", "authors": ["Stephen Grocer", "The New York Times"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/wework-8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
