Some injured terrorists \u201chave \u201corgans spilling out of open wounds,\u201d AFP noted.\n\nThe AFP was granted access to the Kurdish-run detention facility in Hasakeh, a city in northern Syria.\n\nAmong the detained Islamic terrorists are teenagers and men who, according to Kurdish sources, represent over 50 nationalities.\n\nAccording to Kurdish forces, the final territorial remnant of ISIS\u2019s Islamic \u201ccaliphate\u201d in eastern Syria was liberated in March when approximately 2,000 ISIS jihadists surrendered to the Syrian Democratic Forces, a U.S.-allied coalition largely made up of Kurdish fighters.\n\nSince stripping ISIS of its control of its \u201ccapital\u201d Raqqa in 2018 with the help of U.S. air support, Syrian Democratic Forces have continued in intermittent conflict with remaining jihadis still present there. Those under custody in northwest Syrian Kurdistan (Rojava) are demanding to go back to the nations they abandoned to join the establishment of the caliphate.\n\n\u201cI want to leave the prison and go back home to my family. \u2026 I want to go back to Britain,\u201d said 22-year-old Aseel Mathan.\n\n\u201cMy organs are spilling out,\u201d said Aballah Nooman, a Belgian national, who lifted his shirt to reveal an open wound he said he sustained from a fellow jihadist who accidentally shot him while cleaning his weapon.\n\nA 42-year-old ISIS terrorist told the AFP that he deceived his wife into traveling to the \u201ccaliphate\u201d by promising her a vacation in Turkey:\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t tell her, I didn\u2019t want her to be scared,\u201d Abdel Azim says, explaining he has no idea where she and their five children are now. \u201cI would like to see her again. They can hang me after that, I just want to tell her I\u2019m sorry I took them in a country at war.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, President Donald Trump highlighted the Supreme Court\u2019s upholding of the constitutionality of his executive order banning nearly all travel \u2014 and immigration \u2014 from failed Muslim-majority states Chad, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, and Yemen. Democrats and the broader left derided the presidential directive as a \u201cMuslim ban.\u201d\n\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter @rkraychik.", "description": "Diseased and wounded Islamic State terrorists under Kurdish custody in Syria are requesting to be returned home to the West.", "authors": ["Robert Kraychik"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1178786960-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
