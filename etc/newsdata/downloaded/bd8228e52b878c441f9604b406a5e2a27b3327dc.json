And just 24 percent understand that private browsing only hides your browsing history from other users, not from the sites you\u2019re browsing. About half (48 percent) are unsure what private browsing actually does, in fact.\n\nThe survey featured 10 questions, each designed to test the knowledge level of American adults on a variety of digital topics, ranging from cybersecurity and social media, to the businesses that power the internet\u2019s biggest platforms.\n\nOf those surveyed, the median number of correct answers was just four. Only 20 percent of adults answered seven or more questions correctly. Two percent answered all of the questions correctly.\n\nThere were a handful of questions that most answered correctly, such as knowing that phishing scams can occur across multiple platforms (67 percent). 63 percent of Americans understand the purpose of cookies in web browsing. And 59 percent know that advertising is the main source of revenue for most social media sites.\n\nOnly 30 percent of adults know that the \u201chttps\u201d prefix means a website is encrypted. A similar number (29 percent) were aware that Facebook owned both WhatsApp and Instagram. Only 15 percent of Americans could identify Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the biggest correlation among respondents was in education level. Adults with a four year (or better) degree answered a median of six questions correctly, compared with just four for those without a college diploma.\n\nYounger adults \u2014 again, unsurprisingly \u2014 fared better than older respondents. 18 to 29-year-olds, for example, answered a median five out of 10 questions correctly compared to those 65 and older, with a median correct response rate of three.\n\nYou can take the quiz yourself, here.", "description": "", "authors": ["Bryan Clark"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F08%2Fai_security.png&signature=f2aa0a88f0c8a966cfa66c6afbcd62fc", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
