The outspoken director sounded off on the most controversial movie of the year via a Facebook post Saturday morning. Todd Phillips\u2019 revisionist DC origin story, starring Joaquin Phoenix, has already collected $40 million for its opening day, and is on track to become the biggest October opener ever. Below, read Moore\u2019s Facebook post, pasted and embedded.\n\nMore from IndieWire\n\n\u201cOn Wednesday night I attended the New York Film Festival and witnessed a cinematic masterpiece, the film that last month won the top prize as the Best Film of the Venice International Film Festival. It\u2019s called \u2018Joker\u2019 \u2014 and all we Americans have heard about this movie is that we should fear it and stay away from it. We\u2019ve been told it\u2019s violent and sick and morally corrupt \u2014 an incitement and celebration of murder. We\u2019ve been told that police will be at every screening this weekend in case of \u2018trouble.\u2019 Our country is in deep despair, our constitution is in shreds, a rogue maniac from Queens has access to the nuclear codes \u2014 but for some reason, it\u2019s a movie we should be afraid of. \u201cI would suggest the opposite: The greater danger to society may be if you DON\u2019T go see this movie. Because the story it tells and the issues it raises are so profound, so necessary, that if you look away from the genius of this work of art, you will miss the gift of the mirror it is offering us. Yes, there\u2019s a disturbed clown in that mirror, but he\u2019s not alone \u2014 we\u2019re standing right there beside him.\n\nMoore goes on to discuss Donald Trump, China, Robert Mueller, Joe Biden, the media, Sandy Hook and the Columbine shooting, among other topics.\n\n\u201c\u2018Joker\u2019 is no superhero or supervillain or comic book movie,\u201d he writes. \u201cI loved this film\u2019s multiple homages to \u2018Taxi Driver,\u2019 \u2018Network,\u2019 \u2018The French Connection,\u2019 \u2018Dog Day Afternoon.\u2019 How long has it been since we\u2019ve seen a movie aspire to the level of Stanley Kubrick?\u201d\n\nYou can check out Michael Moore\u2019s full impassioned \u201cJoker\u201d defense on Facebook.\n\nBest of IndieWire\n\nSign up for Indiewire's Newsletter.
