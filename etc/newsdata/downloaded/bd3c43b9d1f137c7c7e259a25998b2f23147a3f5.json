The ref let the game run because he has VAR, but VAR then says it was not clear so they don\u2019t overrule it. That doesn\u2019t make too much sense.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s just wow. I saw it was a foul and nothing else. Mr Atkinson I\u2019m sure would have whistled if there was no VAR involved, but now we have somebody else who can make the decision. But somebody else is not making the decision.\n\n\u2018Like the penalty Manchester City did not get yesterday (against Crystal Palace). Come on, that is 100 per cent a penalty. Not clear enough to overrule? They sit in the studio, they see it. Just take it away.\n\n\u2018Pretty much everything went against us. Like our goal, eh? I heard that both players were there with the hand, but the other one is first then it should have been allowed.\u2019 However, United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer insisted it was not a foul by Lindelof and it was right to allow the goal.\n\nLiverpool manager vented his frustrations with the decision at the time with Jon Moss\n\n\u2018No chance, we\u2019re not playing basketball,\u2019 said Solskjaer. \u2018He touched him but it\u2019s not a clear and obvious error.\n\n\u2018I think it was a slight touch but it\u2019s still a man\u2019s game with tackles allowed. That (the handball) was a clear one from Mane. We were on the right end of the VAR decisions.\u2019 The Sky Sports pundits disagreed including former United defender Gary Neville.\n\n\u2018I thought it was a foul,\u2019 said Neville. \u2018They\u2019ve set the bar so high that we\u2019re not going to see it change now, and they\u2019re backed into a corner. I always think the measure is if it\u2019s against my team, and if that was against United I\u2019d want a foul.\u2019\n\nGraeme Souness: \u2018Any way you look at it, if you\u2019re kicked from behind, there\u2019s a foul. He doesn\u2019t get anything on the ball and I think they\u2019ve got that wrong.\n\nThe German coach vented his frustrations after the game with how VAR technology is used\n\n\u2018What influences them is that Origi goes down spectacularly. He has a poor first touch, the ball has gone away from him, he\u2019s lost possession and I think he overeggs it with the way he goes down.\u2019 Klopp was also unhappy over United\u2019s tactics as Solskjaer played with five at the back and looked to hit Liverpool on the break.\n\nUnited had 32.1 per cent possession, their second lowest in a Premier League game at home since the 2003-04 season, and Klopp said: \u2018They were set out to defend us. We should have done better, but it\u2019s the easy thing to do to set up like this.\n\n\u2018When I\u2019m England Man United pretty much set up like this. Everyone built it up like a mountain, but one team set out to defend and one team made the game.\u2019 Jose Mourinho, who was in charge when United only had 32.0 per cent possession in March 2018, had no sympathy for the German.\n\nKlopp also criticised how Manchester United approached the game on Sunday afternoon\n\nJose Mourinho slammed Klopp after Liverpool boss criticised United for their defensive tactics\n\nMourinho told Sky Sports: \u2018He [Klopp] didn\u2019t like the menu. He likes meat and he got fish.\n\n\u2018United, with the limitations they have at the moment, they played with five at the back, were solid and didn\u2019t give the chance of transition. Jurgen Klopp didn\u2019t like the menu.\n\n\u2018Liverpool missed quality to play against a team with a low block. They have a fantastic record of so many victories. But they have limitations against teams with low blocks. They can smash opponents that play the way they want to play against.\n\n\u2018Jurgen clearly has frustrations. It\u2019s a fantastic situation for his team. But at Old Trafford - which is a special place to win - he never did it.\u2019", "description": "Klopp was angry that Marcus Rashford's goal was allowed to stand after referee Martin Atkinson refused to give Liverpool a foul for Victor Lindelof's challenge on Divock Origi in the build-up.", "authors": ["Chris Wheeler For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/22/19967572-0-image-a-68_1571608113529.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
