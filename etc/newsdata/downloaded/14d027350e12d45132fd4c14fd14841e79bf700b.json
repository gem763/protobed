For years, the government has battled Islamist insurgents but now authorities are also turning to a new challenge: schools like Muhudin\u2019s.\n\nPrimary school students attend a class at school that uses a new unified Somali curriculum, at Banadir zone school in Mogadishu, Somalia September 22, 2019. REUTERS/Feisal Omar\n\nThe start of this school year marks the first time since the civil war broke out in 1991 that the government has issued a new curriculum for primary and secondary school students.\n\nAs clan warlords battled each other and armed factions rose and fell, schools had to make do with whatever materials came to hand. More than 40 curricula were used across Somalia, creating a hodgepodge of competing education systems in a variety of languages, the government said.\n\nMuhidin\u2019s school, for example, used Kenyan textbooks but 2 million textbooks printed in Somali have been issued to pupils in most of Somalia since August and their schools have synchronized academic terms, the ministry of education said.\n\n\u201cThis new syllabus is better than the old Kenyan syllabus, which was in English. The new curriculum is the best,\u201d Muhidin said, sitting three-abreast at a desk in his year seven maths and physics class.\n\nSomalia has one of the world\u2019s lowest enrolment rates, with only four out of 10 children here in school, according to the United Nations. Education accounted for $16 million out of this year's budget of $344 million.\n\nSchools sourced textbooks from more than 10 countries during the civil war and English and Arabic replaced Somali as the language of instruction.\n\nThe new books cover English, Arabic, Somali, maths, Islamic studies, science, physical education, technology, and social studies.\n\n\u201cStudents have coped well with the new curriculum because it is based on their religion, culture and vernacular,\u201d said Muhidin\u2019s teacher, Abdulkadir Mohamed Sheikh.\n\nReligious education is particularly important, said State Minister of Higher Education And Culture Abdirahman Mohamed Abdulle. The al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab insurgency also regularly launches deadly bomb attacks in Somalia in a bid to impose its own strict version of Islamic law.\n\nThe government hopes the new textbooks will help counter their message.\n\nClerics helped the government train teachers in Islamic ethics and create a syllabus that \u201cwill produce students who are sound, who are free from terror ideology, moderate students who have Islamic knowledge as well as other subjects\u201d, Abdulle said.\n\nHowever, challenges remain. Only 22% of Somalia\u2019s 30,000 teachers are certified, Abdulle said.\n\n\u201cThe quality of students depends on the quality of the quality of teachers,\u201d he said.", "description": "Every school day, Shuayb Muhidin travels Mogadishu's battle-scarred streets to get to Banadir Zone School.
