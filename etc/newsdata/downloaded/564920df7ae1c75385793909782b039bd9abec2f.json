Would a man working in the White House be asked to account for his wife\u2019s political activities?\n\nTo which I would say: Uh, yes. If Kellyanne Conway was actually senior White House advisor Ken Conway and Ken\u2019s wife happened to be a well-known corporate lawyer who now spent every waking hour dumping publicly on Trump, I feel like that WTF detail *would* routinely be included in profiles of Ken.\n\nA few days ago reporter Caitlin Yilek of the Washington Examiner wrote a piece about Kellyanne being in the running for chief of staff and dared to mention the factoid that her spouse is now the most outspoken Never Trumper in America. Kellyanne didn\u2019t like it. You can read the transcript of her call today with Yilek but I recommend listening to the audio below to savor the flavor. It\u2019s hard to choose the best part but Conway ending the call by idly threatening to \u201ccover\u201d Yilek\u2019s personal life might be it:\n\nConway: So, listen, if you\u2019re going to cover my personal life, if you\u2019re going to cover my personal life, then we\u2019re welcome to do the same around here. If it has nothing to do with my job, which it doesn\u2019t, that\u2019s obvious, then we\u2019re either going to expect you to cover everybody\u2019s personal life or we\u2019re going to start covering them over here.\n\nAlthough actually I think this part is the newsiest:\n\nConway: Um, yes, so, always, right, exactly. You\u2019re really going places. Let me tell you something, from a powerful woman. Don\u2019t pull the crap where you\u2019re trying to undercut another woman based on who she\u2019s married to. He gets his power through me, if you haven\u2019t noticed. Not the other way around. And if these are the, quote, standards, unquote, at the Washington Examiner, then yes, I\u2019d be happy to talk to your editor. But I\u2019ve known your editor since before you were born. So, I can call your editor either way. I\u2019m just trying to give you a chance to explain why you think what you wrote qualifies as breaking news or reporting.\n\nIt\u2019s true that George gets much of his media \u201cpower\u201d from her. He has the giant following that he does on Twitter because of the fascination inherent in watching the spouse of one of the president\u2019s top advisors tweet himself into a frenzy about POTUS every day. But George does have some \u201cpower\u201d of his own. He\u2019s not just a filthy-rich and successful attorney, he\u2019s one of the guys who helped get the Federalist Society off the ground in the 1980s when he founded the chapter at Yale. He has many friends in the top strata of conservative legal circles to this day. Him attacking Trump is part of the \u201cReaganite GOP vs. Trumpist GOP\u201d tensions that keep recurring in Trump\u2019s presidency. His critiques are hugely amplified because of his marriage to Kellyanne but he\u2019s also independently part of the storyline about how influential right-wing lawyers and judges are or aren\u2019t reconciling themselves to Trump.\n\nI don\u2019t think he liked Kellyanne\u2019s jab about \u201cpower\u201d because not long after the Examiner story appeared he tweeted \u2026 this:\n\nI\u2019ve learned a lot about narcissism over the past couple of years that I didn\u2019t know previously. In fact, I didn\u2019t know it had a label, although I had seen it without knowing it. \u2014 George Conway (@gtconway3d) October 24, 2019\n\nGeorge tweets about narcissism every day, as it\u2019s become one of his core critiques about Trump. But I, uh, don\u2019t think it\u2019s Trump at whom this particular tweet was aimed. The bit about how he \u201chad seen it without knowing it\u201d previously is \u2014 hoo boy.\n\nI want to have Thanksgiving at the Conways\u2019 house this year to take in the mood, but I feel like it\u2019d end up being just me and George eating TV dinners.\n\nKellyanne has two complaints about the Examiner piece ultimately. One is that this call was supposed to be off the record. You can read the Examiner\u2019s own defense on that point here; essentially, Conway\u2019s aide called Yilek, they agreed that *his* conversation with her should be off the record, then Kellyanne jumped on the line without clarifying that her part of the call was supposed to be off the record too. The Examiner took the lack of clarity as justification to print what Conway said in full. I would have assumed that the \u201coff the record\u201d agreement with the aide meant that everything was off the record, but oh well.\n\nHer other, more substantial complaint is that George\u2019s tweets about Trump simply have no relevance to a story about Kellyanne possibly becoming chief of staff. Trump hasn\u2019t talked or tweeted about George lately, has he? Well, then, why mention George at all? But that\u2019s ridiculous. Kellyanne can pretend all she wants that Trump has completely tuned out George but any boss would weigh harsh daily public criticism by a deputy\u2019s spouse in choosing whether to promote her. If he makes Kellyanne chief of staff, the media will obsess even more about George\u2019s critiques. The sheer engrossing weirdness of the president being savaged nonstop by the husband of his most powerful aide would be irresistible to them. If he elevates Kellyanne, he\u2019ll inadvertently elevate George too. It\u2019s perfectly correct to say that it\u2019s unfair of George to put her in that position, where her chances of advancing professionally are being held back by his refusal to hold his tongue, but undeniably it\u2019s relevant to stories about Kellyanne being considered for the position. In fact, the Kellyanne/George freak show is really a microcosm of the GOP under Trump: You have one wing of the party that enjoys power and influence because of its proximity to Trump and you have another much smaller and less influential wing that excoriates him relentlessly but attracts an outsized media following because of it. And these two wings are stuck with each other, at least for the moment. Neither one will give so this incredibly awkward marriage stumbles along intact.\n\nUpdate: And here\u2019s Kellyanne Conway\u2019s response to the Examiner, in which, interestingly, she *doesn\u2019t* claim that she thought the call was off-the-record. Although I suppose claiming that at this point would look bad. Better to take the \u201cnothing to hide\u201d approach.", "description": "\"He gets his power through me, if you haven\u2019t noticed.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/k-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
