He presents TV and radio shows (including on RT). He is a film-maker, writer and a renowned orator.\n\nWhen supporters of Catalan leaders jailed for organizing a democratic vote advance on Barcelona airport, media make a fuss over \u2018separatists\u2019 causing chaos. When the same tactic\u2019s used in Hong Kong, it\u2019s a \u2018pro-democracy\u2019 protest.\n\nIn George Orwell\u2019s 1984, The War Ministry was renamed the Ministry of Peace. Truth was Lies, Hate was Love. But author Lewis Carroll got there first.\n\nIn \u2018Through the Looking Glass,\u2019 first published in 1871, Humpty Dumpty tells Alice, and in rather a scornful manner, \u201cWhen I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean \u2013 neither more nor less.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe question is,\u201d said Alice \u201cwhether you CAN make words mean so many different things.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe question is,\u201d said Humpty Dumpty, \u201cwhich is to be master \u2013 that's all.\u201d\n\nHumpty Dumpty has indeed been put back together again, in our newsrooms and in the mouths of our politicians. As so often happens, it finds its apogee in Syria.\n\nOne man\u2019s \u2018terrorist\u2019 is, of course, another man\u2019s \u201cfreedom-fighter\u201d \u2013 but now it\u2019s becoming ridiculous. The so-called \u2018Free\u2019 so-called \u2018Syrian\u2019 so-called \u2018Army\u2019 \u2013the FSA\u2013 are now being denounced all over the world for the savagery of their conduct in the Turkish incursions in north-east Syria.\n\nAlso on rt.com Westerners who propped up Islamist \u2018moderate rebels\u2019 suddenly realize they're terrorists as they launch \u2018genocide\u2019 of Kurds\n\nThe problem is that the Humpty Dumpties fulminating into their fountain-pens against it are the very same Humpties who told us for years that these were \u2018moderate-rebels,\u2019 \u2018secular\u2019 soldiers fighting for \u2018democracy\u2019 against \u2018dictatorship\u2019 in Syria. So much so, we had to give them the guns with which they are now reportedly gunning down Kurdish civilians, and over which we are now oh so appalled\u2026\n\nThose of us who drew attention to the fact that one of the FSA commanders had, in a former role, cut out a prisoner\u2019s heart and eaten it on YouTube, were banned from social media-platforms, branded \u201cAssad-apologists\u201d or \u201cPutin-apologists\u201d or, in my case, both. That the so-called \u2018democratic\u2019 opposition was merely an alphabet-soup of Islamist fanatic forces in white-helmets wearing Mrs Clinton\u2019s lipstick was a truth which simply could not be uttered.\n\nThis tragic farce is, in fact, ending as it began, when Hillary Humpty Dumpty Clinton's launch of the Coalition for a Democratic Syria literally died on her lips when it was pointed out that many of the countries in the coalition were the unfree-est, most anti-democratic countries on earth!\n\nThe name changed but the flow of guns, money, political and propaganda support never did.\n\nAlso on rt.com Protesters shut down key Catalonian transport routes after night of violence (PHOTOS, VIDEOS)\n\nSpace and ennui precludes my adumbrating the full set of the false-teeth in the Syria story, so let me pay homage to Catalonia.\n\nThe democratic government of Spain in the democratic European Union has just handed out a hundred years of prison sentences on democratic Catalan politicians for organising a democratic vote in Catalonia. Worse, a \u201cmob\u201d of their supporters have advanced on...the airport in Barcelona! Commerce, holidays, trade are being WRECKED, wrecked I tell you, by this undemocratic form of protest.\n\nBut, when the exact same tactic is used in Hong-Kong, the demonstrators are NOT a mob, they are not wreckers, they are \u2018democracy-protesters.\u2019\n\nWhen the Hong-Kong protesters confront the Chinese police with Molotovs, knives, even guns, it is the policeman stabbed in the neck who is the villain. When the French police literally disarm Yellow-Vest protesters \u2013that is, to blow their hands off\u2013 even Humpty Dumpty runs out of words, so a complete media veil of secrecy is thrown over the removal of eyeballs, hands and even lives by the gendarmes.\n\nAlso on rt.com Hong Kong phooey! Would you like any hypocrisy with that?\n\nGeorge Orwell\u2019s novel 1984 was supposed to be a dystopian work of fiction, a warning of the perversions of truth which would be required to sustain totalitarianism if we were not careful.\n\nIn 2019, it has become a User\u2019s Manual, a play-book, and some of the worst hypocrites in the world \u2013 otherwise known as the free-media in free-countries \u2013 deploy it to the nodding approbation of the political-classes they serve.\n\nAs Humpty Dumpty said, \u201cThe question is, which is to be master \u2013 that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
