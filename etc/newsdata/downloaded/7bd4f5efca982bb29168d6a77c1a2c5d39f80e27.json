Their final group game was cancelled due to the threat of Typhoon Hagibis.\n\nThe Irish began their own campaign with a resounding win against Scotland, but fell spectacularly unstuck against hosts Japan. However, they since bounced back with second-gear victories against Russia and Samoa. Follow our rolling coverage below:\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

It's Joe Moody off all people who breaks the game line, picking the hole off a neat inside ball. He offloads to Jack Goodhue to carry it another 5 metres or so, leaving the Irish scrambling to recover deep inside their own 22. Relentless, overwhelming, deadly and penetrative. This is New Zealand at their best. Ireland are being cut to shreds here. 43 min: New Zealand 22-0 Ireland New Zealand get their mitts on Rory Best's throw but knock it on in the process. That could have turned ugly. Ireland have the scrum, and Conor Murray boots clear from the base - though it doesn't go very far, mind. 41 min: New Zealand 22-0 Ireland The All Blacks picking up from where they left off, zipping play back and forth across the Irish 22, looking to pick the holes where they can. Aaron Smith spots a gap on the left and threads through the ball with a grubber kick that bounces its way into touch. Ireland line-out on their own five metre line. KICK-OFF! Johnny Sexton gets play back under way. Off we go. Advertisement And back come the players. The second half to follow shortly. Some half-time stats and facts for you... HALF-TIME: New Zealand 22-0 Ireland That's perhaps the most galling thing about this. Twelve of the players to make up the starting XV tonight featured against the All Blacks last November. They've certainly got the talent and means to match New Zealand. It just goes to show how decisive a fragile mental constitution can be. Ireland look like they simply just don't believe anymore. HALF-TIME: New Zealand 22-0 Ireland I've got to say: It's been somewhat embarrassing from the Irish at times. To think how sublime, how assertive, how commanding they were 11 months ago in Dublin during that tense 16-9 victory - it's almost painful to see them so lifeless and limp tonight. What on earth is going on? Advertisement HALF-TIME: New Zealand 22-0 Ireland A masterclass from New Zealand. And the stuff of nightmares for Ireland. The gulf in quality between the two teams has been vast, with the All Blacks simply too hot for handle. Every time the Irish have got their hands on the ball, momentum has been lost through either a knock-on or a disastrous lapse in concentration that has allowed the world champions to reclaim possession. New Zealand, in contrast, have looked menacing with every surge forward. They're capitalising on their opponents' mistakes but also carving them open with some lovely, free-flowing rugby that the Irish have been helpless to stop. HALF-TIME: New Zealand 22-0 Ireland 43 min: New Zealand 22-0 Ireland We've gone to TMO. Ireland had the original penalty but Nigel Owens overturns his decision after the replays show Peter O'Mahony flying into the breakdown with his shoulder. 42 min: New Zealand 22-0 Ireland A quick maul forms off the line-out but New Zealand disrupt Irish efforts to force the recycle. Joe Schmidt's men come back again in numbers, this time taking play up to a few metres out from the All Blacks' try line. Advertisement 40 min: New Zealand 22-0 Ireland Ireland ramp up the pressure. They're making good progress here, hitting their opponents with wave after wave to take play up to the 22. The penalty is drawn - and Johnny Sexton uses it to his advantage, dinking over the top for a chip-and-chase. It's no good, but it doesn't matter. We go back to the penalty for an Irish kick as the half-time gong rings out. 39 min: New Zealand 22-0 Ireland A crushing push from the Irish sees the All Blacks shunted backwards, but there's no penalty - despite the protestations of the crowd. Conor Murray gets his hands on the ball from the back and quickly hacks at it with angled slice-kick that pings off Richie Mo'unga in the process before bouncing out for an Ireland line-out. A final first-half flourish for the men in green? 37 min: New Zealand 22-0 Ireland Well, there's a first. Richie Mo'unga has failed to find touch. I didn't think the All Blacks did mistakes... We go back for an Irish scrum on the centre point. 36 min: New Zealand 22-0 Ireland Ireland are looking short of ideas and creativity as another dropped ball fumbles forward, with Joe Scmidt's men struggling to get out of their own half at the moment. Oh, and there's a penalty against the Irish too. Connor Murray has been pinged for tackling Beauden Barrett off the ball. Richie Mo'unga to kick for touch. Advertisement 32 min: New Zealand 22-0 Ireland (Barrett try) So under pressure from the New Zealand rush defence, the ball was knocked out of the hands of Johnny Sexton's hands following a crunching tackle from Sevu Reece. The question was whether the ball had bounced off the All Black in the process, with Richie Mo'unga punting it forward before Beauden Barrett gave chase to dive over down in the right, but TMO revealed there was no knock-on. Ireland's night already looks to be over... No, it's good, it's a try! Right, time to put that into words... Wait, wait, wait! We've gone to TMO... TRY! Beauden Barrett is over for New Zealand!
