If you\u2019re not a writer, most of what you know about Bread Loaf might come from an episode of \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d \u201cMoe\u2019N\u2019a Lisa,\u201d in which the series\u2019s mendacious bartender, Moe, winds up at \u201cWord Loaf\u201d along with Lisa Simpson, who has helped him with his poetry. The episode concludes with a cartoon Jonathan Franzen and a cartoon Michael Chabon in a fistfight. (Chabon: \u201cYou fight like Anne Rice!\u201d)\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that virtually everything in that episode is wrong, except the hayride. Yes, there\u2019s a hayride.\n\nThe conference has changed from its early days, though. No longer are there pitchers of Bloody Marys at lunch, and it has been decades now since John Gardner\u2019s wife hired a crop duster to litter the mountain campus with leaflets accusing him of ducking out on his child support. No longer does Robert Frost somehow light his papers on fire during a reading by Archibald MacLeish, after loudly complaining, \u201cArchie\u2019s poems all have the same tune!\u201d Gone are the luminaries of earlier eras, including Norman Mailer, Ralph Ellison, Truman Capote, Stanley Elkin, Toni Morrison, Anne Sexton, Richard Yates, Eudora Welty, John Irving and George R.R.
