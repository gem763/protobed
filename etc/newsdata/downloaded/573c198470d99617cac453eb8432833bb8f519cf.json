He was 75.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Producer Ric Ocasek arrives at the 2015 MusiCares Person of the Year tribute honoring Bob Dylan in Los Angeles, California February 6, 2015. REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni/File Photo\n\nOcasek was pronounced dead at his townhouse after someone called 911 about 4 p.m. EDT (2000 GMT) to report that he was unresponsive, a New York Police Department spokesman said. The cause of death will be determined by the city\u2019s coroner.\n\nHis representatives could not be reached for comment on Sunday.\n\n\u201cSo sad. Such a great writer, singer, player, producer,\u201d fellow classic rocker Peter Frampton said on Twitter of Ocasek. \u201cMy thoughts are with his family. Rest in peace.\u201d\n\nOcasek, born Richard Theodore Otcasek in Baltimore in 1944, met bass player and future band mate Benjamin Orr after moving to Cleveland for high school.\n\nThe pair joined with guitarist Elliot Easton, keyboard player Greg Hawkes and drummer David Robinson to form the Cars in mid-1970s Boston. Ocasek was the main songwriter, sang lead vocals on most songs and played rhythm guitar.\n\nThe band\u2019s self-titled debut album, featuring the singles \u201cJust What I Needed,\u201d \u201cMy Best Friend\u2019s Girl\u201d and \u201cGood Times Roll,\u201d reached Number 18 on the Billboard album charts and put them on the leading edge of pop rock.\n\nThe Cars scored their first top-20 single, \u201cLet\u2019s Go,\u201d in 1979 and launched a succession of hits throughout the 1980s such as \u201cShake It Up\u201d and \u201cDrive,\u201d always identifiable through Ocasek\u2019s distinctive vocals.\n\nThe band split up in 1988, and Orr died of pancreatic cancer at age 53 in 2000. The surviving members reunited for a final album, \u201cMove Like This,\u201d in 2010.\n\nThe band was inducted into the Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Hall of Fame in 2018.\n\nAfter the final dissolution of the Cars, Ocasek, who often spoke of his dislike for touring, produced dozens of albums, released solo material, wrote poetry and made visual art.\n\nOcasek was married three times and had six sons, two from each relationship.\n\nHis third wife, supermodel Paulina Porizkova, announced in May 2018 that the couple had separated after 28 years of marriage.", "description": "Ric Ocasek, the idiosyncratic lead singer and chief songwriter of the 1970s and 80s hook-heavy hitmakers The Cars, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan.
