(Oct. 2) AP, AP\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 A recent speech about \u201cBeing a Christian Leader\u201d by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was promoted on the State Department\u2019s homepage Monday, and has been met with criticism that it potentially violates the principle of separation of church and state enshrined in the Establishment Clause of the Constitution.\n\nThe speech was delivered at the America Association of Christian Counselors on Friday in Nashville, Tennessee. Pompeo touts Christianity throughout the remarks, describing how he applies his faith to his government work, referencing God and the Bible during the entirety of the speech.\n\nThe remarks, posted and promoted on the department's homepage, begin with Pompeo, America\u2019s top diplomat, saying he wanted to \u201cuse my time today to think about what it means to be a Christian leader,\u201d continuing that he, \u201clearned how to lead at whatever level I'm blessed with during my time at West Point and other experiences, but I want to talk today about being a Christian leader. I learned that through a very different experience, an experience with God and my own personal faith in Christ.\"\n\n\u201cNow, I know that even having just said that, I know some people in the media will break out the pitchforks when they hear that I ask God for direction in my work,\u201d he continued.\n\nThe home page for the U.S. Department of State promoting Secretary Mike Pompeo's speech. (Photo: U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE)\n\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) National, a Muslim civil rights and advocacy group, said that Pompeo \u201cshouldn't be a Christian leader, he should be an American leader...leading a nation of people who have different faiths and no faiths.\"\n\nQasim Rashid, a Muslim state Senate candidate in Virginia, tweeted, \u201cWhen do we get to see 'Being a Jewish or Muslim or Sikh or atheist leader?'\"\n\nFormer head of the National Jewish Democratic Council Aaron Keyaksaid that \"There's obviously no issue with the Secretary of State being a leader, nor his being a proud Christian. But it's a problem that Secretary Pompeo thinks it's appropriate to put those two words together and hold an official State Department event on being a Christian leader.\"\n\n\"Him talking as a Christian leader and billing it as such is an affront to our separation of church and state,\" added Keyak.\n\nMore critics have expressed their dismay at the remarks, and the promotion of the speech on the State Department's homepage.\n\n\u2757Friday: Attorney General Barr denounced secular Americans\n\n\u2757Saturday: President Trump declared that Americans will \u2018forever and always\u2019 believe in \u2018the eternal glory of God\u2019\n\n\u2757Monday: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declares himself a 'Christian Leader' https://t.co/tX8eySqgygpic.twitter.com/TmZkeYOrgO \u2014 Americans United (@americansunited) October 14, 2019\n\nMore Pompeo: \"On Being a Christian Leader\": \"I know some people in the media will break out the pitchforks when they hear that I ask God for direction in my work.\" It's fine to have faith.

In March, Pompeo agreed \"it's possible\" God sent Trump to save Israel from Iran.\n\nAnother Trump administration official, Attorney General William Barr, also gave a speech on religion on Friday, decrying secularism as a root of some of society's problems, including drug overdoses, mental health issues, and violence.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to the State Department for comment.\n\n\u201cScripture calls us to be \u2018transformed by the renewing of minds,'\u201d Pompeo said Friday. \u201cAnd so I keep a Bible open on my desk, and I try every morning to try and get in a little bit of time with the Book. I need my mind renewed with truth each day. And part of that truth is, as my son reminds me, is to be humble.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will all be in my prayers as you do God\u2019s work, and I covet yours as I lead American diplomacy,\u201d Pompeo concluded in his remarks last week.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/14/state-dept-website-promotes-mike-pompeo-speech-critics-decry/3980544002/", "description": "The speech and promotion of it on the department's website were met with criticism that it violates the principle of separation of church and state.", "authors": ["Savannah Behrmann", "Published P.M.
