San Francisco quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo was 20-for-29 for 181 passing yards.\n\nThe 49ers (4-0), the only unbeaten team in the NFC, held Cleveland to 180 yards. Defensive end Nick Bosa recorded two sacks and made two other tackles for loss.\n\nQuarterback Baker Mayfield threw for 100 yards, completing just 8 of 22 throws for the Browns (2-3), who committed four turnovers. For Mayfield, a second-year pro, it marked his first career start without a passing touchdown.\n\nBreida ripped off an 83-yard touchdown run on the 49ers' first snap for the first of his 11 carries. He also scored on a 5-yard pass from Garoppolo later in the first quarter.\n\nThe 49ers went 90 yards on the first possession of the second half, with Garoppolo throwing 22 yards to George Kittle for a touchdown and a 28-3 advantage.\n\nSan Francisco rushed for 185 first-half yards, so it didn't matter that Garoppolo had thrown for only 46 yards.\n\nMayfield was intercepted and lost a fumble in the first 11 1/2 minutes before he completed a pass.\n\nThe 49ers failed to convert after the second of those turnovers when Robbie Gould's 47-yard field goal attempt drifted wide.\n\nCleveland broke through early in the second quarter, with a 10-play drive resulting in Austin Seibert's 30-yard field goal.\n\nThe Browns moved into scoring position on their next possession, but Antonio Callaway failed to make a catch at the goal line and the batted ball was picked off by K'Waun Williams and returned 49 yards.\n\nThe 49ers made the most of the turnover on Coleman's 19-yard touchdown run. He finished with 16 carries.\n\nMayfield had 80 passing yards in the first half.\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "Matt Breida set the tone with a long run as part of 114 rushing yards as the  San Francisco 49ers dominated the visiting Cleveland Browns in a 31-3 victory ...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
