Can Mr. Biden, nostalgic and blunder-prone, really convince an anxious party that he is a man in tune with the times? Can the Brooklyn baritone of Mr. Sanders really move the masses to the political revolution he promises? Can Ms. Warren erase voters\u2019 concerns, sometimes whispered even at her own rallies, about her general election viability?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just a real anxiety about not making a mistake,\u201d said David Axelrod, the former chief strategist to President Barack Obama, citing the party\u2019s angst about defeating Mr. Trump. \u201cThat may raise the sensitivity to people\u2019s potential liabilities. But I think what campaigns are about in certain ways is to put these theories to the test and explore people\u2019s strengths and weaknesses and see who emerges. In 2007, there still was this chatter about \u2018can Obama actually win a general election?\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Biden and the two progressive senators are making radically different bets on the electorate.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s enormous, enormous opportunities once we get rid of Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Biden said in his opening, before pledging to build on the Affordable Care Act, unlike rivals who prefer a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d system.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear,\u201d Ms. Warren said in one exchange with Mr. Biden, joining Mr. Sanders in suggesting that the former vice president was not being bold enough, \u201cI\u2019ve actually never met anybody who likes their health insurance company.\u201d\n\nBut the three do share some surface similarities as prospective opponents for Mr. Trump, aside from their age. They are all veterans of the public eye, their weaknesses familiar to many Americans. And they have all been underestimated at various points in this primary, their manifest campaign warts \u2014 Mr. Biden\u2019s gaffe-making, Ms. Warren\u2019s fraught history with Native American ancestry, Mr. Sanders\u2019s competition from Ms. Warren for liberal hearts and minds \u2014 misdiagnosed as politically lethal.\n\nFor Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders, a clash at center stage was perhaps inevitable. Over their decades in Washington, they have taken divergent paths to the top of Democratic politics.\n\nMr. Biden has played the unrepentant insider, firm in his belief that making change is a matter of gradual progress and warm relations with ideological foes. And Mr. Sanders has been the unkempt agitator, long convinced that his uncompromising liberalism would take hold through sheer force of organizing.", "description": "The top 10 candidates took the debate stage together for the first time, as the time to draw contrasts begins to run out.", "authors": ["Matt Flegenheimer", "Katie Glueck"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/12/us/politics/12debate-moment/12debate-moment-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
