After the account opening, the investor has to approach his brokerage firm and send buy orders. As far as orders are concerned, they are the critical tools for a forex trader which he can use while executing a trading strategy. Orders help the traders in protecting returns and limiting the risks.\n\nUnderstanding the different types of order in the forex market can help forex traders to identify which order can help him reach his trading goals.\n\nTypes of Order in the Forex Market\n\nAs you know that the forex market is open 24 by 7. That means, the value of trader\u2019s holdings keep changing 24 by 7. If the trader does not properly manage open positions, he can see the value of his holdings change drastically. Therefore, in such situations, the orders come in handy; ensure the trader or investor\u2019s trades remain in a limit even of the market moves 24 by 7.\n\nHere, we\u2019ve mentioned the different types of order used in the forex market listed below:\n\nMarket Order:\n\nA market order is an order that you use to enter the market at the current market price. It is the most common and popular order in the forex market where trader places the order to tell his broker to buy or sell the currency pair at the current market price.\n\nIf you have a habit of buying things online then think of market order as the \u2018Buy Now\u2019 button that you click to buy a specific product. It is the order that always executed since the order automatically searches for the best possible price for the moment and becomes open position immediately.\n\nLimit Order:\n\nLike market order, the limit order is also quite popular since it is used to buy or sell at a specific price or better. When this order is placed, it means the trader will buy or sell a defined amount of units of a currency pair at a specific value or better.\n\nHowever, there is no guarantee that the order will be executed on your specified amount. Because if your specified price does not meet, the order will not be executed. With the limit order, you won\u2019t have to continuously monitor the market. You can place your order after putting the price and wait until a specific price does not meet.\n\nStop-Loss Order:\n\nEarlier two orders were the orders that help us enter the market at the specified price while this \u2018Stop-loss\u2019 order is the order that helps us exit the market safely. It is an order that is placed to prevent the trade from additional losses. There are two types of stop order \u2013 \u2018buy order\u2019 which triggers when the ask price is met and \u2018sell order\u2019 which triggers when the bid price is met.\n\nWhen in losses, the stop-loss order can help in preventing further loss. It helps in saving time and closing open-positions.\n\nTrailing Stop-Loss Order:\n\nA trailing stop-loss order is almost like the stop-loss order where the yooou will exit the trade in case the price drops and hits the stop-loss level, reducing the additional losses. Only, the difference is, it will automatically trail position as the market moves in your favour.\n\nOr we can say, that the order will sell off an open position when the price hits the stop-loss price but trail and move upwards in case of profiting.\n\nDIFFERENT TYPES OF ORDER IN THE FOREX MARKET\n\nThese are some common different types of order use in the forex market.
