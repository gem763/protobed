You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nSpeaking in Helsinki alongside Belgian prime minister Charles Michel, who is the next European Council president, Mr Rinnie told reporters: \u201cI think there is no time in a practical or legal way to find an agreement before the EU Council meeting. We need more time.\u201d\n\nSpanish foreign minister Josep Borrell, who is set to take over as the EU\u2019s foreign affairs chief, meanwhile told reporters outside a meeting in Luxembourg that there might be a need to \u201cstop the watch\u201d and ask for more time.\n\n\u201cYou know, in Europe, we always take decisions on the edge of the precipice, on the edge of the cliff,\u201d he said. \u201cEven when the last minute comes, then we stop the watch and say that we need technically more time to fulfil all the requirements, all the last minute requirements.\u201d\n\nThere was little progress to show from technical talks in Brussels, despite discussions continuing over the weekend and both sides labelling negotiations as \u201cconstructive\u201d. A negotiating \u201ctunnel\u201d covering the talks means that there is little official information about what is being discussed in the room between the two sides.\n\nThe two sides are understood to be working on a legal text covering customs arrangements for the Irish border \u2013 with the need for more time potentially down to the painstaking legal nature of the work as much as disagreement in principle. The EU insists that any proposals must be \u201clegally operable\u201d before being signed, meaning the plans must be a complete watertight legal text.\n\nA delay to talks beyond this week\u2019s gathering of EU leaders would complicate matters as under UK law the prime minister will have to request an extension to Article 50. The Commons is expected to hold an unprecedented emergency weekend sitting on Saturday to assess progress.\n\nDelays could also mean that further emergency summit may be required to sign off a deal, if one were reached \u2013 as it was in November when Theresa May got her last minute agreement.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

It\u2019s too early to say whether it\u2019s possible to get a breakthrough this week or whether it will move into next week,\u201d Mr Coveney, the T\u00e1naiste, told Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9 at a ministerial meeting in Luxembourg.\n\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re attempting to do here is to write a legal text for an international treaty, that is a Withdrawal Agreement. That means it\u2019s got to be watertight, it\u2019s got to stand up to full scrutiny and legal challenge potentially, and what they\u2019re trying to do is complicated.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to put in place an arrangement that is NI-specific, that protects UK interests and EU interests, in a way that\u2019s quite complex. So we need to give negotiating teams space to do that, I think there is good will and a political determination to get this done.\n\n\u201cIt is being left very late in the day but we shouldn\u2019t write off this summit as a potential opportunity for agreement.\u201d\n\nDowning Street again on Monday ruled out any delay. The PM\u2019s official spokesman told a Westminster briefing: \u201cThe talks remain constructive but there is still a lot of work still to do.\u201d\n\nAsked whether the PM was sticking to his 31 October pledge, the spokesman said: \u201cI think the prime minister has always said we need to leave the EU on the 31.\n\n\u201cWe need to leave the EU on 31 October to restore trust in our democracy. That is what the prime minister is committed to achieving.\u201d\n\nThe spokesman said it was \u201cnews to me\u201d that a technical extension could be possible.\n\nAsked if this was the last chance to get a deal, he said: \u201cThe PM has set out we are under great time pressure and has repeatedly stressed the importance of us completing this process so we can leave on 31 October.\u201d\n\nThe spokesman added: \u201cIf after three years of debate we are able to secure a deal that parliament can support, the public would expect parliament to work around the clock to pass that legislation in order to allow us to leave on that date.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The DUP signalled again at the end of last week that it would not back any plan that treated Northern Ireland differently in customs terms to the rest of the UK \u2013 though to be the only way to solve the border deadlock.\n\nAsked about Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg hinting he may \u201ceat his own words\u201d and back a new customs plan, the Northern Irish party\u2019s Brexit spokesperson Sammy Wilson said on Monday: \u201cWhatever appetite he has for his own words ... we will not be eating our own.\u201d", "description": "EU leaders have told Boris Johnson there is no way to strike a Brexit agreement before this week\u2019s summit, destroying his hopes of presenting a deal to parliament at a special sitting on Saturday.", "authors": ["Jon Stone"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/14/19/boris-johnson-opening.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
