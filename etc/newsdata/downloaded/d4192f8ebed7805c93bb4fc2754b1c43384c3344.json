Hours after announcing the death of one of the world\u2019s most notorious terrorists, President Trump found little love at the World Series.\n\nIn his first appearance at a Major League Baseball game since taking office, Mr. Trump was not invited to throw the first pitch when he showed up Sunday night at Game 5 between the Washington Nationals and the Houston Astros. Instead, when he was shown on the stadium\u2019s large screen, the crowd booed robustly and began chanting, \u201cLock him up!\u201d In the upper decks, fans held up a giant \u201cImpeach Trump!\u201d banner.\n\nThe unfriendly reaction may explain his reluctance to take himself out to the ballpark until now. Although he has boasted of his time as team captain for the baseball squad at the New York Military Academy and in the past happily offered regular commentary on the game, before Sunday Mr. Trump had never attended a professional baseball contest while living in the White House, an unusually prominent break from the national pastime for a sitting president.\n\nConceding nothing to the moment, Mr. Trump arrived at the park dressed in his trademark dark suit, white shirt and red tie.
