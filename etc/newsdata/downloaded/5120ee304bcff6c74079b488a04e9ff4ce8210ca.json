Some schools canceled classes on Monday, and the city said in a press release there are reports of gas leaks.\n\nDallas Fire-Rescue spokesman Jason Evans said the department was responding to a structural collapse, from which seven people made it out safely. He said the department responded to multiple calls from people injured in their homes by broken glass.\n\nMeteorologist Jason Godwin said radar confirmed the twister struck the ground near Love Field Airport and moved northeast through the city. Local media outlets reported several homes and businesses were damaged, power lines downed, and tree limbs were scattered across roadways.\n\nGodwin said the size and severity of the tornado won't be known until crews arrive to survey the damage.\n\nThe storm happened as multiple severe thunderstorm watches and warnings covered portions of four counties, including Dallas County, and more stormy weather was expected in the area.\n\nLew Morris, one of the DJs of Reckless Rock Radio, said he was at the station when tornado touched down.\n\n\"The power went out first,\" Morris said. \"Within two to three minutes of the power going out I heard the distinctive whistle of a tornado.\"\n\nHe said the building started shaking and he could hear the windows shattering along with debris banging around.\n\nDallas police said officers in one part of the city were going door-to-door to check on residents.", "description": "The fire department responded to multiple calls from people injured in their homes by broken glass in US state of Texas.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/21/63802a39ee8c4870b2eed868e012463c_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
