She was only 13, and had recently moved to California from Jalisco, Mexico, with her parents and six siblings.\n\nCarrillo had tried to explain that her family hadn\u2019t crossed any river, but it didn\u2019t matter. \u201cThey looked at us differently,\u201d she recalled.\n\nCarrillo, who is now 44 and works for a commercial loan company, would never forget the remark. It stung, as did the sideways glances at her worn white sneakers and the grocery bag in which she carried her textbooks. It was difficult then, Carrillo says. But she doesn\u2019t remember feeling scared, not like she is today, eight weeks after 22 people were killed in the worst hate crime against Latinos in modern US history.\n\n\u201cEvery day when I take my daughter to school we pray. I ask God to protect her,\u201d Carrillo said \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to see my daughter or my husband at the end of the day.\u201d\n\nFor Carrillo and many Latinos across the US, the August violence in El Paso, wrought by a gunman who intended to shoot \u201cas many Mexicans as possible\u201d, marked a day they long feared would come. The killings came less than a week after a gunman, who had previously complained about \u201chordes of mestizos\u201d, shot three people at a food festival in Gilroy, California. And they followed years of belligerent rhetoric by Donald Trump, who launched his presidential campaign in 2015 by calling Mexicans rapists and has directed his administration to crack down on undocumented immigrants and asylum seekers.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lidia Carrillo, 44, says she prays for her daughter every day. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to see my daughter or my husband at the end of the day.\u201d Photograph: Sarahbeth Maney/The Guardian\n\nHate crimes are up across the United States, said Brian Levin, the director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, rising steadily since 2016. Crimes targeting Latinos have increased nearly 80% in California since 2016. In 2018, nearly four out of ten Latinos in the US said they had experienced discrimination in the last year.\n\n\u201cThe more that negative stereotypes are accessible and the more that they\u2019re amplified by peer groups or leaders, it\u2019s not unexpected they\u2019ll be acted on,\u201d Levin said.\n\nCarrillo and others have changed their lives in subtle ways in response to a country that seems increasingly hostile toward them, forced to reckon not only with deadly violence, but day-to-day harassment: racial slurs screamed out of car windows, and insults for speaking Spanish in public.\n\nRicardo Castillo, who lives in Eustis, Florida, and is originally from Puerto Rico, generally feels safe in his city, but still saves family grocery trips for nighttime when stores are less busy. His family avoids crowded places, and Castillo tries to always be aware of the nearest exit. The El Paso shooting shocked him, but it didn\u2019t surprise him. \u201cThere\u2019s hate out there,\u201d Castillo said.\n\nCastillo\u2019s own experience with racial harassment was seen more than 200,000 times on Facebook. A video of two women telling Castillo, the manager of a Burger King, to stop speaking Spanish went viral in July.\n\n\u201cGo back to Mexico if you want to keep speaking Spanish,\u201d a woman, seated with another woman in the restaurant, told Castillo. \u201cGo back to your Mexican country.\u201d\n\nThe more that negative stereotypes are accessible and the more that they\u2019re amplified ... it\u2019s not unexpected they\u2019ll be acted on. Brian Levin\n\n\u201cGuess what, ma\u2019am? I\u2019m not Mexican,\u201d Castillo responded. \u201cI\u2019m not Mexican, but you\u2019re being very prejudiced and I want you out of my restaurant right now.\u201d\n\nSuch behavior seems more common and blatant than ever before, said Carlos Romero, who works in student services at a community college in Tucson, Arizona.\n\n\u201cI know it was always here in Arizona,\u201d Romero said, citing the state\u2019s efforts to ban ethnic studies in public schools, the \u201cshow your papers\u201d law, and the echoes of former governor Jan Brewer\u2019s rhetoric in Trump\u2019s campaign. \u201cBut because of Trump, people are more willing to show that part of themselves now.\u201d\n\nThe El Paso shooting, perpetrated by a 21-year-old who parroted Trump\u2019s own words, made Romero worry for Latinos across the US, as well as his own family. \u201cIt made me think \u2018what are we going to do now?\u2019 My wife and I talked about whether we need to get passports.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Carrillo family had planned to go to the Gilroy garlic festival on the day the shooting happened, but weren\u2019t able to.

The 36-year-old educator struggled to figure out how to explain the events to her six-year-old son.\n\n\u201cI had to explain to him why mommy didn\u2019t feel well,\u201d she recalled. There was this bad man and he went and killed people. There\u2019s certain people who don\u2019t like brown people, she told him. It wasn\u2019t the first time they\u2019d had such a conversation. They discussed gun violence because of the active shooter drills he participates in at school and they\u2019ve been forced to talk about prejudice, and racism. In kindergarten, the boy had come home from school one afternoon telling her she shouldn\u2019t speak to him in Spanish because he was going to get \u201cpushed over the wall\u201d.\n\nSanchez lived in California in the 1990s, when then-Republican Governor Pete Wilson backed a ballot measure that cut off state services such as healthcare and public education to undocumented immigrants. There was an animosity toward immigrants then, Sanchez recalled, but it wasn\u2019t as bad as this.\n\n\u201cThe climate of fear is heightened more than I\u2019ve ever seen it in my life,\u201d she said.\n\nThe climate of fear is heightened more than I\u2019ve ever seen it in my life. Irene Sanchez\n\nIncidents such as the El Paso shooting impact people far beyond those experiencing the violence firsthand, according to Lisseth Rojas-Flores, a clinical psychologist and professor at Fuller Theological Seminary. Mass violence should be thought about like an earthquake, she argued. There is the epicenter, the people directly impacted by the shooting, and there are layers around that: those who live in El Paso, and even further out to people who don\u2019t necessarily have a direct connection to the event or city.\n\n\u201cIt still impacts you because it rattles you at your core, especially if you realize they were aiming at Latinos, you ask: \u2018I am Latino what does it mean for me?\u2019\u201d Rojas-Flores said. \u201cI was very troubled by it because I understand the levels of exposure and impact, it keeps on adding to an already anti-immigrant climate.\n\n\u201cIt brings to the forefront more fear.\u201d\n\nThe fear and violence are the results of a president who is openly anti-Latino, said Thomas Saenz, the president of Maldef, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund.\n\n\u201cThe discrimination is certainly more direct, more open than in my lifetime and certainly emanates from the president of the United States,\u201d Saenz said, adding that Trump\u2019s policies and practices seem, \u201cintent on eliminating the Latino community as an essential part of the country\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Adriana Lopez, Lidia Carrillo\u2019s 13-year-old daughter, avoids wearing anything that could make her a target. Photograph: Sarahbeth Maney/The Guardian\n\nSince the shootings, the 13-year-old daughter of Lidia Carrillo won\u2019t wear her Mexican soccer jersey outside the house.\n\n\u201cIt could make me a target,\u201d said Adriana Lopez, a ninth-grader who likes skateboarding and reading the bible.\n\nThe Carrillo family had planned to go to the Gilroy food festival the day of the shooting, but weren\u2019t able to. Thank God, Carrillo thought.\n\nFor her daughter, coming of age in an era of mass shootings has meant she\u2019s always been worried about such violence, but it\u2019s even harder knowing people who look like her are being targeted.\n\n\u201cI always thought this just happened in history, like this stuff didn\u2019t happen anymore,\u201d Lopez said. She thinks about the shooters in El Paso and Gilroy \u2013 a colleague of her mother\u2019s knew the man responsible for the deaths at the garlic festival \u2013 and wonders why. What would make someone want to commit such violence?\n\nShe wants people to understand that immigrants come to the US to make better lives for themselves, not to make things worse. It\u2019s personal for her, the daughter of immigrants. Earlier this year her aunt was deported.\n\nIn school, classmates have made jokes about \u201cbuilding the wall\u201d. The US is all she\u2019s ever known, and she is patriotic, but thinks sometimes about how some of her fellow Americans are against her.\n\nHer mother tries to remind her that what other people think doesn\u2019t matter. Carrillo tells Lopez that she\u2019s not less than anyone else, she was born here and she can do anything. Carrillo, who is also a US citizen, is grateful that her family is in America, but wishes it were a kinder place to people like her.\n\n\u201cI just wish it could be different for us minorities and Hispanics. I know it\u2019s not our country,\u201d she said, her voice trailing off before she corrected herself. \u201cI wasn\u2019t born here, but I work just like anyone else. I contribute. I pay taxes. It is my country, too.\u201d", "description": "Hate crimes have risen steadily since 2016, and Latinos say they feel vulnerable: \u2018It rattles you at your core\u2019", "authors": ["Dani Anguiano"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c262b46fda82da0e5997ef2152683aed307905b/636_288_2360_1417/master/2360.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=99e8b074360718d617fb961413e93a79", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
