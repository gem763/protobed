On 16 and 17 September she is hosting a workshop at Hoi Polloi in London, with proceeds going to the Judy Blame Charitable Trust.\n\nWhen were you happiest?\n\nCamping with my parents in the south of France. We went every year with the beautiful bell tent they made on a sewing machine. We even had a lavatory tent which was fabulous except, one day, it blew away with my father in it.\n\nWhat is your earliest memory?\n\nFights in the sandpit.\n\nWhat is the trait you most deplore in yourself?\n\nCraziness.\n\nWhat is the trait you most deplore in others?\n\nIdiocy.\n\nWhat do you most dislike about your appearance?\n\nThat I am approaching 100.\n\nWho would play you in the film of your life?\n\nSusan Sarandon or Barry Humphries.\n\nWhat do you owe your parents?\n\nWhen I was a fashion student, my mother would say, \u201cWhy can\u2019t you get yourself a nice suit from Jaeger?\u201d She didn\u2019t really get it, but she gave me support.\n\nTo whom would you most like to say sorry, and why?\n\nTo my parents, for being such a bitch.\n\nWhat or who is the greatest love of your life?\n\nMy children, my grandson, my dog.\n\nWhat is the worst job you\u2019ve done?\n\nHop-picking in Kent when I was 13.
