We wanted to smother them.\n\n'We wanted a good and fast start, and Leeds broke and scored very quickly it was a terrible start in the second half.'\n\nThe hosts had the first opportunity, in front of a atmospheric Den, when Mahlon Romeo found space on the right hand flank, and delivered a low drive that Leeds goalkeeper Kiko Casilla had to turn away with his feet.\n\nTom Bradshaw managed to double the hosts' lead with a flicked header before half-time\n\nMillwall took the lead after fifteen minutes, when Gaetano Berandi fouled Tom Bradshaw in the area, leading to the dismissal of the Leeds defender. Jed Wallace stepped up to fire into the top right hand corner to give the hosts first blood.\n\nThe home team continued to look for the second goal, and Ben Thompson forced Casilla to collect on 26 minutes.\n\nSubstitute Shaun Williams almost put his name on the scoresheet two minutes before the interval, when he flicked a Shaun Hutchinson corner just wide of the post.\n\nHowever, the lead was doubled just before the break, when a low cross from the left by Ferguson was poked home by Bradshaw to leave Casilla standing flat.\n\nLeeds needed inspiration, and they made a half-time replacement with Helder Costa being replaced by Barry Douglas.\n\nIt seemed to be the spark they needed, and they got back into the game less than twenty seconds after the restart, when a Jack Harrison delivery saw Ezgjan Alioski tap home from less than six yards out.\n\nThe goal rejuvinated the visitors, who looked a lot more lively in their all-round play.\n\nGjanni Alioski scored shortly after the break to give Leeds hope but it would not be enough\n\nMateusz Klich fired wide for Leeds on 68 minutes, as Millwall appeared to lose their way and were starting to look jaded.\n\nThe hosts were standing off their opponents, although a free kick by Jed Wallace on 86 minutes was matched by Casilla.\n\nBodvarsson should have done better with an effort in injury time that bounced tamely to the goalkeeper.\n\nHowever, after forcing a number of corners at the end the home side ran out with a deserved victory.\n\nWith their second defeat in south London in the space of a week, with a loss at Charlton last weekend, head coach Marcelo Bielsa felt he was too late in making changes before the break.\n\nHe said: 'The second Millwall goal was important in the match, after the first half I took some decisions to improve the team.\n\n'We should have taken those decisions in the first half.\n\n'We realised this superiority more in the second half than the first, and maybe I could have made the decision before.\n\n'We played without freedom in defence, the second goal was important for them because I was waiting for the second half to reorganise.'", "description": "Millwall caretaker manager Adam Barrett was thankful he was able to give the departing Neil Harris a victory as his side beat ten-men Leeds.
