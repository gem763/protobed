API/S\n\nAnalysts had estimated U.S. crude inventories rose around 2.8 million barrels last week.\n\n\"An enormous U.S. inventory build hits at precisely the wrong moment when the markets are overly focused on demand devastation due to the latest run of weaker global economic data,\" Stephen Innes, Asia Pacific market strategist at AxiTrader, said in a note on Thursday.\n\nIf confirmed by the government data, the build-up would be the biggest U.S. inventory swell since February, 2017, Innes said.\n\nMeanwhile concerns about the future of the global economy - and therefore oil demand - grew as data from the United States showed that retail sales fell for the first time in seven months in September. That followed data earlier this month showing a moderation in job growth and services sector activity in the same month.", "description": "Oil prices fall as data points to huge build in U.S. stocks", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEBA20ZO_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
