Photo: Getty Images, Hulu\n\nBig day today: Across the country, agitated swarms of concerned citizens have assembled to force the government\u2019s hand on issues of immediate importance. To be clear: I\u2019m not talking about the Global Climate Strike, although given the urgency of the goal there \u2014 hammer the must-act-yesterday nature of the climate crisis into diplomats\u2019 brains ahead of the United Nations Climate Action Summit \u2014 I can see where you might think that. No, I\u2019m talking about a strange happening unfolding in Nevada, where hundreds of extraterrestrial enthusiasts have descended upon a mysterious desert military base.\n\nYes, friends, it\u2019s finally time to \u201csee them aliens.\u201d The big Area 51 raid is happening now, and it looks every bit as unhinged as we ever could have hoped.\n\nOn our way to \u201csee them aliens\u201d! Photo: George Frey/Getty Images\n\nArea 51 raid? Sorry, huh?\n\nBack in June, a California Man named Matty Roberts made what he thought would be a hilarious joke: a Facebook event inviting any and all interested parties to \u201cstorm Area 51\u201d on September 20, because \u201cthey can\u2019t stop all of us\u201d from barging in if we \u201cNaruto run\u201d as a unit.\n\n\u201cThey,\u201d in that equation, seemed to refer to the United States Air Force, which uses Area 51 as a base; \u201call of us\u201d would appear to mean anyone who clicked attending, a digital army that quickly ballooned to roughly 2 million people. This was, as you might imagine, a more enthusiastic response than Roberts anticipated. \u201cI waited for like three days and there were like 40 people and then it just completely took off out of nowhere,\u201d Roberts told CNN affiliate KLAS-TV in July. \u201cI was just like, the FBI\u2019s going to show up at my house, and it got a little spooky from there.\u201d\n\nObviously, though, the only way a large group of humans stands a chance of gaining entry into a government stronghold as shadowy as Area 51 is by ambushing it in giant screaming hordes. Realizing, perhaps, that some people might actually be willing to do this (the truth has been withheld from us for so long!), the Air Force issued a stern reminder to potential participants that \u201cany attempt to illegally access military installations or military training areas is dangerous.\u201d\n\nWhy Area 51, though?\n\nBecause if you believe the rumors-slash-conspiracy-theories, Area 51 is where the government conducts tests on the bodies of dead aliens and on their wrecked flying machines. The government has classically gone out of its way to keep Area 51 off the public\u2019s radar, which naturally only makes people more curious about what goes on in there.\n\nGot it. So did people actually show up?\n\nOh hell yes, although not millions of them. CBS estimates turnout to be somewhere in the \u201chundreds,\u201d basically a lot of people doing this:\n\nSick.

Instead of storming the base, the crowds would peaceably assemble for a music festival called \u201cAlienstock\u201d in nearby Rachel, Nevada, a tiny town with a single motel.\n\nRoberts planned to put on the event with the help of his original co-host, Brock Daily, and a woman named Connie West. According to the New York Times, however, Roberts and Daily abandoned ship over concerns that Alienstock would turn out to be \u201cFYREFEST 2.0,\u201d and directed their followers to a Bud Light-sponsored event in Las Vegas instead. Still another gathering \u2014 Storm Area 51 Basecamp in nearby Hiko, Nevada \u2014 beckoned believers to two days of alien talks, starting today.\n\n\u201cNo one is gonna actually try to raid Area 51, it\u2019s a joke...\u201d pic.twitter.com/7PspRc19ga \u2014 Kendall Rae\ud83d\udcab (@KendallRaeOnYT) September 20, 2019\n\nThe Las Vegas event happened yesterday (see below), but Alienstock and Storm Area 51 Basecamp are ongoing.\n\nAlien Stock in Las Vegas, Nevada, not to be confused with Alienstock, in Rachel, Nevada (and nearer to Area 51 proper).

Based on on-the-ground footage posted to Twitter, this cohort was small but jazzed: One person blasted \u201cThe Final Countdown,\u201d an Arrested Development-famous tune by the band Europe, from a boombox. Meanwhile, a few amped dudes chanted \u201cclap them cheeks,\u201d apparently a reference to aliens\u2019 preferred methods of human testing: the anal probe.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of all kinds,\u201d a motel worker in Rachel told the New York Times.\n\nAll kinds. Photo: BRIDGET BENNETT/AFP/Getty Images\n\nDespite the obvious enthusiasm, some attendees reportedly wished the crowd had been bigger. \u201cI\u2019m a little disappointed because it\u2019s a lot less people than they said online,\u201d Nathan Brown, of Oregon, told the Law Vegas Review-Journal. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be back [to the area]. This was kind of the thing.\u201d\n\nDid anyone do a Naruto run, as per the plan?\n\nYou bet!\n\nHas anyone made it into Area 51 so far?\n\nAccording to CBS, the local sheriff\u2019s office has detained two people, but whether or not they actually made it past the gates is presently unknown: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear if a woman who began ducking under the gate and a man who urinated nearby were arrested after the crowd gathered about 3 a.m.\u201d\n\nAbout a week before the shit-show actually got underway, however, two Dutch vloggers managed to stroll a full three miles into Area 51 before the law caught up with them. Presumably their brains have since been wiped and their extraterrestrial memories replaced with dust.\n\nDid any aliens show up?\n\nDifficult to say, with so many people wandering around in alien garb. But, you know, the aliens are always watching!\n\nStay in touch.
