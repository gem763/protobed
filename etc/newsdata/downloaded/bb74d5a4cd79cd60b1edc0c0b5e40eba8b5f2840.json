(TSX: GCM; OTCQX: TPRFF) is pleased to announce that Eric Sprott has agreed to purchase 3,260,870 Units of the Company in a non-brokered private placement (the \u201cPrivate Placement\u201d) at a price of C$4.60 per Unit, representing a 4% discount to the five-day volume weighted average price of $4.79 for the period ended October 29, 2019, for a total investment of $15 million. The proceeds of the Private Placement will be used for general working capital and corporate purposes. Closing of the Private Placement is subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals, including the Toronto Stock Exchange, and is expected to close two business days following receipt of such approval. Each Unit consists of one common share and one common share purchase warrant exercisable into a full common share at $5.40 per share for a period of four years from the date of issuance.\n\n\n\nSerafino Iacono, Executive Chairman of Gran Colombia, stated, \u201cOn behalf of the Board and Management of Gran Colombia, I am pleased to welcome Mr. Eric Sprott as a major investor in our Company. Our success in the turnaround of Gran Colombia has led to an increase in gold production, earnings and free cash flow and has strengthened the Company\u2019s financial position. In September, we were recognized in the inaugural TSX30 based on the increase in our share price over the last three years. We see the investment by Mr. Sprott, a well-known gold investor, as solid endorsement of the potential for further appreciation in Gran Colombia\u2019s shares. We are about to ramp up our near-mine and regional exploration programs at our high-grade Segovia Operations with approximately 70,000 meters of drilling over the next 18 months and we are unlocking value in our Marmato Project through a spin out to a separate-listed vehicle, in which we will maintain a control position, to fund a major underground mine expansion. We look forward to the relationship with Mr. Sprott as we continue to execute our strategy.\u201d\n\nAbout Gran Colombia Gold Corp.\n\nGran Colombia is a Canadian-based mid-tier gold producer with its primary focus in Colombia where it is currently the largest underground gold and silver producer with several mines in operation at its Segovia and Marmato Operations.
