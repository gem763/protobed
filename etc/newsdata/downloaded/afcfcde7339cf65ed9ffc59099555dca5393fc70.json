The Cameroonian also said he was spat at and had bottles thrown at him.\n\nBoth sets of players later returned to the pitch after the abandonment in a \"show of solidarity\".\n\nHaringey supporter Ben James attended the game and told the Press Association: \"We were stood toward the other end so can't comment on what we heard. But it all began when the referee gave Yeovil a penalty.
