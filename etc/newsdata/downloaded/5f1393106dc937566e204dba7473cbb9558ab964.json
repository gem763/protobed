All right.\u201d And they depantsed him, just as they\u2019re doing to all of baseball at the moment.\n\nGet off the tracks, because these Nationals, they are a runaway train right now. The first National League Championship Series game in the history of this city began under perfect conditions \u2014 packed park, 71 degrees, home team and home fans with unprecedented swagger \u2014 and only got better.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThey won going away, 8-1. They lead the series, three games to none. They play Tuesday for the right to go to this town\u2019s first World Series in 86 years. They have two losses in the past three weeks.\n\nThey are, somehow and suddenly, a machine. From 12 games under .500 in May and left for dead to one win from the pennant and roaring through October. Kinda miraculous.\n\n\u201cThis team is not a miracle,\u201d right fielder Adam Eaton said. \u201cLook who\u2019s in here.\u201d\n\nHe is speaking of Stephen Strasburg and Max Scherzer, of Anthony Rendon and Juan Soto and all the rest. The pieces and parts, they were around since spring. They\u2019re just now humming at the perfect time.\n\nAD\n\nThis run, dating back to the eight-game winning streak that closed the regular season, is now 15 wins in 17 games. During it, the Nats snuffed the postseason hopes of both the Philadelphia Phillies and the Cleveland Indians. Since the playoffs started, they kneecapped the 106-win Los Angeles Dodgers and are in the process of absolutely suffocating the Cardinals. Pick your stat to show the dominance, but here\u2019s a favorite: There have been 27 innings played in this series. The Nats have been tied after five of them \u2014 and led after the other 22.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHard to win a game if you can\u2019t get a lead,\u201d Shildt said.\n\nA legitimate lament. For the Nats, it\u2019s the opposite. Confidence has replaced doubt. Joy has replaced dread. Smiles all around.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have fun in this game, or in anything that you do,\u201d said third baseman Anthony Rendon, \u201cthen in the end, you shouldn\u2019t be doing it.\u201d\n\nThe Nats are doing it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done nothing yet,\u201d first baseman Ryan Zimmerman countered.\n\nTechnically, yes. But think of it like this: In order for the Cardinals to push this series back to St. Louis, they have to beat the Nationals in back-to-back games, games that will be started by $140 million lefty Patrick Corbin and veteran right-hander An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez, who was last seen carrying a no-hitter into the eighth inning of his start against the Cards in Game 1. The last time the Nats lost consecutive games: a month ago, Sept. 13 and 14, to the Atlanta Braves.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHere\u2019s about what went wrong Monday night, in front of a sellout crowd of 43,675: Soto slipped in left field, allowing the Cards their only run, and Stephen Strasburg had to pace around the mound for Michael Buffer, the legendary (and out-of-place) boxing ring announcer, to finally belt out, \u201cLet\u2019s get ready to rumbllllllllllllle \u2014 and play ball!\u201d\n\nStrasburg was so thrown off by the theatrics that he needed three pitches to discard Cardinals leadoff hitter Dexter Fowler.\n\nThat\u2019s where these Nats are right now, with more October moxie than any of the four previous versions that played in the postseason. Instead of shrinking from the moment, they are swelling in it.\n\nAD\n\nHow they dealt with Flaherty is a glimpse into that attitude. He has developed into the Cardinals\u2019 ace, as important to their NL Central championship as any player. Over his past 18 starts, including two in the playoffs, his numbers were remarkable: a 1.13 ERA in which he allowed opposing hitters a .151 average and a teeny-weeny .435 on-base-plus-slugging percentage. Not once, in those 18 starts, did he allow more than three runs.\n\nAD\n\nIn the third inning, the Nats tagged him for four.\n\nSo put Flaherty\u2019s pelt on the wall, if there\u2019s space left. Pitchers Washington has victimized this postseason throw with different arms and have vastly different r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, but there are some choice names.\n\nAD\n\nThey beat Josh Hader, Milwaukee\u2019s nasty left-handed reliever, who entered the eighth inning of the wild-card game with a two-run lead and walked out of Nationals Park with his season over, the losing pitcher. They beat Clayton Kershaw, the legendary Dodgers lefty, essentially twice \u2014 first in his start in Game 2 of the division series, then on back-to-back homers that tied Game 5 in the eighth. On Saturday, they ground it out against Adam Wainwright, the 38-year-old St. Louis mainstay who \u2014 when the 20-year-old Soto was still playing coach-pitch Little League \u2014 helped pitch the Cards to the 2006 World Series title as an up-and-coming closer.\n\nAD\n\nAnd now, Flaherty, who lasted all of four innings, and was tagged by the Nats\u2019 pass-the-baton offense in that third \u2014 Eaton\u2019s RBI single to Rendon\u2019s run-scoring double to Soto\u2019s full-count walk to Howie Kendrick\u2019s two-run double.\n\nOther teams don\u2019t know these names? Study up, Houston and New York.\n\nAD\n\nThe names those teams and towns know, though, are the Nats\u2019 spine of a rotation \u2014 Strasburg and Scherzer, Corbin and S\u00e1nchez. They are why this team withstood that lousy start. They are the reason they are plowing through the postseason. They are the reason it\u2019s unimaginable that they\u2019ll lose four straight.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re what our team\u2019s built around,\u201d Zimmerman said. \u201cThose guys, the horses that take the ball every fifth day.\u201d\n\nTo the Cardinals, they look like Clydesdales. Strasburg essentially broke club bylaws by not taking a no-hitter into \u2014 or beyond \u2014 the seventh, as both Sanchez and Scherzer did in the two games in St. Louis. But he ended a 117-pitch outing with snarling strikeouts of Matt Wieters and the helpless Fowler on Strasburg\u2019s unhittable change-up.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo add up the numbers, and use them to further present the case that the Nats\u2019 formidable rotation has made them a formidable postseason team: 21\u2154 innings, nine hits, no earned runs, three walks and 28 strikeouts. In three games against Nats pitchers, the Cards are hitting .121 with a .167 on-base percentage and a .143 slugging percentage.\n\nPatrick Corbin, your turn.\n\n\u201cI know Corbin\u2019s going to go out and try to be just as lights out as they have been,\u201d Rendon said.\n\nThe poor Cards. They just happen to be in the way of the only Nationals team that has ever been playing its best ball headed into October, that had to survive a no-fingernails-left wild-card game, that found its groove in the division series.\n\nRight now, the venue doesn\u2019t matter. The opposing pitcher doesn\u2019t matter. The Nats are rolling. Best to get out of the way. They have four chances to reach the World Series. What evidence is there they\u2019ll need more than one?\n\nAD\n\nFor more by Barry Svrluga, visit washingtonpost.com/svrluga.\n\nRead more on the Washington Nationals and the NLCS:", "description": "Washington is one win from an NLCS sweep and its team is a runaway train right now.
