After all, she left her paying gigs to marry into the House of Windsor last year, shutting down her lifestyle site The Tig and leaving the USA Network\u2019s \u201cSuits\u201d after acting on the show for seven years.\n\nRead more: What Meghan Markle is giving up to marry Prince Harry\n\n\u201cThe royals do work hard but it isn\u2019t like they\u2019re stacking shelves or anything,\u201d tweeted one HuffPost reader, \u201dand risk losing their jobs if they have to leave early to look after a sick child and they can afford excellent child care.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you have servants and unlimited money!!\u201d Posted another. \u201cIt\u2019s no sweat compared to everyone else.\u201d\n\nIf you need a good laugh -- Meghan Markle called herself a working mom... \u2014 \u2661\u2661 (@aaachristiine) September 26, 2019\n\nDid Meghan Markle really describe herself as a \u201cworking mum\u201d? That\u2019s mental. And suggesting it\u2019s difficult is absolutely right, for actual working mums! \u2014 Mike Harris (@mikeharrisbsc) September 25, 2019\n\nIndeed, Markle is fortunate enough to be free from two of the biggest struggles most working mothers face: finding affordable child care and paid leave.\n\nOnly 17% of civilian workers, and 16% of private industry workers, have access to paid family leave such as maternity leave, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And once the baby comes, only 15% of private sector workers get paid leave for things like sick days, which leaves most parents struggling to arrange child care if their kids fall ill.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, child-care costs have jumped to almost $10,000 a year for just one child\u2019s day care. Almost 2 million parents with kids under five had to quit their job, refuse an offer or switch jobs in 2016 because of child-care issues. And about one-third of mothers in a recent FlexJobs survey said that having kids threw their careers off track, because their jobs were too inflexible for them to work and raise kids. And 70% of those women who left the workforce to raise children have had difficulty coming back.\n\nRead more: 7 in 10 parents admit to sending sick kids to school, but they have 3 good reasons why\n\nAnd that doesn\u2019t even get into the financial and child-care issues faced by single moms, considering about one in four U.S. mothers are raising their children on their own \u2014 including Markle\u2019s own mother, Doria Raglan, once upon a time. Women already earn just 80 cents for every dollar a man makes, on average, with black women making just 61 cents for every dollar earned by white men, and Latina women earning 53 cents. And single mothers are statistically almost five times more likely to be poor than married-couple families. (That\u2019s not stopping single moms from raising kick-ass kids, however.)\n\nLauren Pullar, a mother of two from Long Island, sympathized with Markle\u2019s working mom guilt \u2014 with some caveats. \u201cRegardless of your job, there is always a feeling of guilt that you\u2019re missing out on something,\u201d said Pullar, 41. \u201cHowever \u2026 her experience of motherhood is far different from mine. Having an army of nannies, and staff at beck and call, makes the \u2018struggles\u2019 of working a lot easier.\u201d\n\nGetty Images How relatable are the royals?\n\nBut Meredith Bodgas, editor in chief of Working Mother and a mother of two, told MarketWatch that Markle is, in fact, probably experiencing many of the same learning curves and emotional struggles as new parents everywhere.\n\nRelated: Child-care costs forced this single mom to give up her job\n\nAnd yes, she considers both Markle and fellow duchess and sister-in-law Kate Middleton working moms.\n\n\u201cThey are out and about for long hours, the way working mothers are. And I will not pretend that they have it just as hard as we have it; they don\u2019t, it\u2019s much easier. But they are working, and I don\u2019t consider them to be stay-at-home moms,\u201d said Bodgas.\n\n\u201cYes, their lives are probably much better and much easier, much richer, than the average working mother\u2019s life. They have the best nannies in the world. They have every comfort that they could possibly want,\u201d she added. \u201cBut they still have royal duties which take them away from their children. They still have royal duties that take them places that they might not necessarily want to go.\u201d And while the royals technically don\u2019t have to worry about being fired, per se, \u201cthere probably are repercussions that we don\u2019t know about,\u201d said Bodgas.\n\nDenise Albert, a mother of two and co-founder of TheMOMS.com and Mamarazzi, agreed.\n\n\u201cMeghan is a working mom. It\u2019s obviously different for her than the rest of the moms in the world, but any woman, regardless of their status and lifestyle, goes through many of the same struggles internally when trying to find a way to do their \u2018all\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cI 100% believe she does struggle, and though she\u2019s a duchess and might look like she lives in a fairy tale, at the beginning and end of every day, she is a new mom adjusting and learning how to be the best mom to Archie, while working and doing it all in the public eye.\u201d", "description": "Mothers are divided on the Duchess\u2019 remarks that being a working mom is \u201ca lot.\u201d", "authors": ["Nicole Lyn Pesce"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS155_Meghan_ZG_20190926152021.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
