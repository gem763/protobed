Under a law passed in Westminster last month, Johnson is not allowed to negotiate to shorten whatever extension the EU chooses.\n\nRather than seek to compromise with opponents who want proper time to scrutinize the Brexit deal, Johnson responded to the 322 to 308 vote defeat on fast-tracking it by halting the passage of his deal altogether while Britain waits to see what extension the EU will grant.\n\n\u201cWe will pause this legislation,\u201d he said, a phrase that sounded innocuous but could well trigger an epic new election showdown between the forces of Remain and Leave.\n\nA snap vote could take place before Christmas.\n\nJohnson had earlier won a vote on his deal\u2014the first time his government has won a single significant vote in the Commons. That was a major step towards securing Brexit, as Parliament has always refused to back any formal arrangement that would result in leaving the EU.\n\nThe next phase of the legislation\u2019s progress is where things become more difficult, however, as lawmakers are able to amend the bill in order to clarify sections or\u2014as No. 10 fears\u2014introduce so-called wrecking amendments that would collapse the bill entirely.\n\nJust last week, Johnson had secured a compromise deal that many thought was impossible in Brussels, but that came at a serious cost. The EU had sworn they would not re-open the Withdrawal Agreement that had been negotiated with Theresa May, but then Johnson did what he said he would never do and he caved on one of his key red lines.\n\nHe signed up to a version of the deal that May had rejected, which would effectively create a customs border in the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and the mainland.\n\nThat concession led to a breakthrough in Europe but it meant the Democratic Unionist Party, which had been propping up the Conservative government, fled from the deal.\n\nIt was lawmakers who made the most aggressive speeches attacking the prime minister during a contentious debate in the House of Commons. Sammy Wilson of the DUP said he felt they had been betrayed by the Conservatives. \u201cI nearly choked when the prime minister said it,\u201d he said on Tuesday.\n\nWilson and his nine DUP colleagues voted against Johnson\u2019s expedited deal.\n\nWilson was particularly aggravated that Johnson had been unfamiliar with the precise details of the deal he had agreed that would govern Northern Ireland\u2019s relationship with the rest of Britain.\n\nThere were doubts about exactly how familiar Johnson was with the customs rules that he was attempting to rush through Parliament.\n\nJill Rutter, an independent former civil servant who worked at the Treasury and No. 10, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think Johnson understands what he has agreed for Northern Ireland\u2026\u201d", "description": "The prime minister put Brexit deal on hold after Parliament refused to let him fast-track it into law by Halloween.
