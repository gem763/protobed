She said: \u201cI hate that I did that but it\u2019s the truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want this new chapter in my life to be about being authentic to who I am rather than trying to meet someone else\u2019s standards,\u201d she said.\n\nLovato, who said that she was \u201cworking on an anthem\u201d in the studio said, \u201cJust so everyone\u2019s clear.. I\u2019m not stoked on my appearance BUT I am appreciative of it and sometimes that\u2019s the best I can do. I hope to inspire someone to appreciate their body today too.\u201d", "description": "Demi Lovato repents for posting a photoshopped bikini pic earlier in the week with a glorious, unedited image, cellulite and all.
