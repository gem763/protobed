The former vice president, Joe Biden, is a front-runner in the 2020 Democratic presidential contest.\n\nIn an ABC News interview that aired Tuesday, Hunter Biden concedes he may have made a mistake \u201cin the grand scheme of things\u201d for failing to see the political repercussions for his father.

That\u2019s where I made the mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I take full responsibility for that. Did I do anything improper? No, not in any way.
