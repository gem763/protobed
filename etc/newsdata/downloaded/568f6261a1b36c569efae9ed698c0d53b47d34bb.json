The implosion triggered the end of Antonio Brown\u2019s tenure in the Steel City and ushered in a new era at wide receiver led by JuJu Smith-Schuster.\n\nAt running back, the new era already had begun. Le\u2019Veon Bell didn\u2019t play the entire season and eventually hit free agency. James Conner took over and it was almost like Pittsburgh didn\u2019t skip a beat.\n\nAs the Steelers have been the dominant force in the AFC North for several years over the last decade, the Baltimore Ravens and Cleveland Browns now appear to have loaded rosters ready to control the division for years to come.\n\nIt\u2019s time to see what Ben Roethlisberger can do with legitimate contenders in the division.\n\nThe defense will also be put to the test with several starters returning for the 2019 season. The team also added linebacker Mark Barron and defensive back Steven Nelson in free agency to give opponents some extra threats to worry about.\n\nWhile the Steelers are still a contender to win the division, it will be interesting to see how they respond to a bit of a whirlwind of an offseason and how they recover from missing the playoffs in 2018.\n\nRead below for more about the Steelers heading into the 2019 season.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n--\n\n2019 SCHEDULE\n\nWeek Date Time (ET) Channel Opponent 1 Sept. 8 8:20 pm NBC @ New England Patriots 2 Sept. 15 1:00 pm FOX Seattle Seahawks 3 Sept. 22 4:25 pm CBS @ San Francisco 49ers 4 Sept. 30 8:15 pm ESPN Cincinnati Bengals 5 Oct. 6 1:00 pm CBS Baltimore Ravens 6 Oct. 13 8:20 pm NBC @ Los Angeles Chargers 7 Bye 8 Oct. 28 8:15 pm ESPN Miami Dolphins 9 Nov. 3 1:00 pm CBS Indianapolis Colts 10 Nov. 10 4:25 pm FOX Los Angeles Rams 11 Nov. 14 8:20 pm FOX/NFL @ Cleveland Browns 12 Nov. 24 1:00 pm CBS @ Cincinnati Bengals 13 Dec. 1 4:25 pm CBS Cleveland Browns 14 Dec. 8 4:25 pm CBS @ Arizona Cardinals 15 Dec. 15 1:00 pm CBS Buffalo Bills 16 Dec. 22 1:00 pm CBS @ New York Jets 17 Dec. 29 1:00 pm CBS @ Baltimore Ravens\n\n--\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH\n\nQB: Ben Roethlisberger\n\nRB: James Conner\n\nWR: JuJu Smith-Schuster\n\nDE: Cameron Heyward\n\nLB: T.J.
