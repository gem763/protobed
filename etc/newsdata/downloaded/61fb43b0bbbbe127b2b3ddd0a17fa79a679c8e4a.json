Independents, however, have slowly started to support impeachment or impeachment proceedings.\n\nAs of Oct. 10, an average of impeachment polls calculated by FiveThirtyEight, a polling analysis website, shows 49.3% of respondents supporting impeachment and 43.5% not supporting it.\n\nHere is what the individual polls say about impeachment, separated by each question.\n\nImpeachment: All of the people who have been subpoenaed so far in House Democrats' impeachment inquiry\n\nApprove of the House opening an inquiry?\n\nA poll conducted by NPR/Marist/PBS NewsHour from Oct. 3 to Oct. 8 shows 52% of adults support House Democrats starting an impeachment inquiry into Trump \u2014 43% disapprove.\n\nThis is an increase from their earlier polling of the same question the night of Sept. 25, one day after Pelosi announced the impeachment inquiry. The poll showed Americans supported the opening of an inquiry at 49% to 46%.\n\nIndependents' views also appeared to have shifted in the early October poll: 54% of independents supported the opening of an inquiry, and 41% disapproved. In contrast, 50% disapproved and 44% approved in the Sept. 25 poll.\n\nPolling by The Washington Post/Schar School released on Oct. 8 and conducted from Oct. 1-6 mirrored the finding: 58% of adults said they supported the opening of an inquiry and 38% opposed it.\n\nTrump in Minnesota: Trump lashes out at Democrats over impeachment inquiry at Minneapolis rally\n\nVoting to impeach?\n\nA USA TODAY/Ipsos poll released on Oct. 3 and conducted from Oct. 1-2, just one week after the beginning of the inquiry, found 45% of Americans approved of a vote in the House to impeach Trump, and 38% disapproved of a vote. Forty-four percent of people in the same poll approved of the Senate voting to convict the president, and 35% did not.\n\nIn June, previous polling conducted for USA TODAY by Suffolk University found that only 31.8% of registered voters thought the House \"should seriously consider impeaching President Trump,\" with 60.6% opposing it. That poll had been conducted prior to special counsel Robert Mueller's testimony before the House, and far before the emergence of details of Trump's Ukraine controversy.\n\nApprove of impeachment and removal from office?\n\nFox News asks the question slightly differently in its poll. A Fox News poll conducted from Oct. 6-8 among registered voters shows 51% of voters supported Trump's impeachment and removal from office, 4% supported impeachment but not removal, and 40% opposed impeachment.\n\nThis result drew a rebuke from Trump, who tweeted on Oct. 10 to say \"Whoever [Fox's] Pollster is, they suck.\"\n\nWhen Fox had asked the same question in July of this year, 42% of voters supported impeachment and removal, 5% supported impeachment but not removal, and 45% opposed impeachment.\n\nMore: Trump renews attacks on Fox News after poll found 51% of voters support impeachment, removal\n\nViews on Trump and Ukraine?\n\nThe NBC/WSJ poll conducted from Oct. 4-6 asks about impeachment by asking adults what actions they think should be taken about Trump's dealings with Ukraine.\n\nAdults were asked whether there was sufficient evidence to impeach and remove Trump, whether to hold an impeachment inquiry, whether there was insufficient evidence to hold an inquiry, or if they were not sure.", "description": "Public opinion polling has shown noticeable shifts\u00a0in attitudes towards impeachment, though every single poll has asked about impeachment differently.", "authors": ["Nicholas Wu", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TdnHDxyPpYUyH4aZ7h93.w--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/a3e81f547f99bb6c459e5c3bd881223f", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
