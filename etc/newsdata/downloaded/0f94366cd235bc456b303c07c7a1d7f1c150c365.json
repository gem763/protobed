He \u201cwent into all the reasons why it means so much, because he can be so sweet. He can be the sweetest.\u201d\n\nWhen it came time for West to accept the award, the Yeezy mogul claimed on stage that it actually had been MTV that roped Swift into the presentation duties as a way to boost ratings.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m standing in the audience with my arm around his wife, and this chill ran through my body,\u201d Swift recalled of watching with Kardashian from the crowd. \u201cI realized he is so two-faced. That he wants to be nice to me behind the scenes, but then he wants to look cool, get up in front of everyone and talk shit. And I was so upset.\u201d\n\nSwift said she still wasn\u2019t ready to tank their growing relationship just yet, and accepted West\u2019s apology, along with a big bouquet of flowers the next day, pledging to \u201cmove past this.\u201d\n\nAnd now we arrive at that phone call. Swift said she initially was \u201ctouched that he would be respectful\u201d and run the line from his song past her before releasing it.\n\nBut hearing the line in full \u2015 Swift maintained that she did not approve the \u201cI made that bitch famous\u201d lyric \u2015 nailed shut the chance of a Swift-West detente, and she posted her famous \u201cI would very much like to be excluded from this narrative\u201d entreaty on Instagram.\n\n\u201cWhen I heard the song, I was like, \u2018I\u2019m done with this,\u2019\u201d Swift said. \u201cIf you want to be on bad terms, let\u2019s be on bad terms, but just be real about it.\u201d\n\nAnd so they were.\n\nRead the profile of Swift at Rolling Stone.", "description": "The singer gives her blow-by-blow view of her long feud with the rap mogul in a revealing Rolling Stone profile.", "authors": ["Entertainment Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8229142300001c05571664.jpeg?cache=fufraempbc&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
