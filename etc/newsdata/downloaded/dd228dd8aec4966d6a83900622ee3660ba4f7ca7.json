Police fired teargas and water cannon to disperse the demonstrators.\n\nIf passed, the new laws would usher in sweeping changes that activists have described as a disaster for human rights and democratic freedoms.\n\nAmong a series of contentious articles are those that would outlaw adultery, unmarried couples living together, as well as make insulting the president a criminal offence that could carry a jail sentence.\n\nProtesters also demanded the government repeal a law passed last week that is widely believed will curtail the investigative powers of Indonesia\u2019s anti-corruption agency the Corruption Eradication Commission, known as the KPK.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Protesters allow an ambulance to pass through in Jakarta.

As several demonstrators attempted to break in, police fired rounds of teargas and water cannon.\n\nAt least 20 killed and 70 injured in day of violence in West Papua Read more\n\nAfter being pushed back from the building some protesters burned tyres and damaged a police post by a nearby bridge. At least three people have reportedly been arrested in Jakarta.\n\nBy nightfall at least 100 protesters remained, singing and waving the Indonesian flag, while some managed to tear down the parliament gates.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An Indonesian police officer shouts during a clash with protesters outside the parliament building in Jakarta.

At least 40 protesters have been hospitalised with injuries in South Sulawesi, and 28 in Palembang, South Sumatra.\n\nThe parliament had initially scheduled to pass the proposed criminal code on Tuesday, but has faced mounting pressure to delay.\n\nHuman Rights Watch has described the draft code as \u201cdisastrous not only for women and religious and gender minorities, but for all Indonesians\u201d.\n\nBesides outlawing adultery, and effectively gay sex, the draft code could also result in women who have unlawful abortions being jailed for four years, and would expand the country\u2019s controversial blasphemy law, which has been used to repeatedly prosecute religious minorities. The article that would criminalise insulting the president or Indonesian state, activists feared, could roll back hard-won press freedoms since the fall of Suharto.\n\nIn an apparent U-turn, President Joko Widodo announced last Friday that he had ordered parliament to postpone the bill, saying more time was needed to hear revisions, but students around the country feared the government might still attempt to push it through in the final days of their term.\n\nOn Tuesday the head of the parliamentary commission overseeing legal affairs confirmed the bill had been postponed and would be carried over to the next set of legislators.", "description": "At least 40 injured in student protests over plans that include outlawing extramarital sex", "authors": ["Kate Lamb"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b2f56546704246a91a85210a7f7ea94ba95c965/0_318_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=48f190c65447e8d6c3c538c965b268ea", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
