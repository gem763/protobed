But it could be triggered by heat, cold, friction, pressure on the skin, sun and even water.\n\nCold-induced urticaria makes up about one to three per cent of all urticaria cases, according to the National Organisation of Rare Disorders.\n\nPatients are advised to go to A&E if they have difficulty breathing, swallowing, dizziness or are vomiting, as this can be a sign of anaphylactic shock, the NHS say.\n\nAngioedema is similar to hives, but the swelling occurs beneath the skin, such as around the eyes, lips and sometimes hands feet and the tongue.\n\nEpisodes involving the intestinal tract cause severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.\n\nAngioedema is estimated to affect one in 50,000 people, according to the US National Library of Medicine.\n\nMs McDonald said: 'I am always on guard as we never know when it is going to happen which makes it even scarier.\n\n'Tommy starts to worry as soon as he sees the rash which I think makes the rash worse.\n\nMs McDonald can't wrap Tommy up in layers because he must stay around room temperature\n\n'As the years have gone on, we have noticed it is both hot and cold weather conditions that cause him to have a flare up.'\n\nThe unpredictable flare ups have put a strain on family activities because Ms McDonald is often too 'anxious' in case Tommy has a reaction.\n\nShe and her partner Ben Leitch, 32, have postponed their dream wedding abroad as they are frightened the urticaria and angioedema will flare up.\n\nMs McDonald said: 'He has missed out on lots of play dates with his friends and as a family we have been unable to go on holiday or on day trips as I am too anxious in case it happens when we are on the plane or abroad.'\n\nTreatment for urticaria and angioedema involves anti-histamines and oral steroids or injections in severe cases.\n\nMs McDonald and her partner Ben Leitch, 32, have postponed their dream wedding abroad as they are frightened the urticaria and angioedema will flare up.

He is pictured with his sister\n\nMs McDonald said she had to turn to Facebook groups for help because there was no information at her local GP surgery. Her two children are pictured in hospital\n\nTommy must always stay around 20\u00b0C because if he is exposed to a temperature too low or high then his skin begins to break out.\n\nHis mother ensures he wears suitable clothing in summer and winter to try and avoid reaction.\n\nHe can wear a coat and t-shirt during the winter and must avoid fleecy pyjamas at night as he will overheat.\n\nDuring the summer, he wears UV swimwear and spends no longer than 20 minutes outside in both weather conditions.\n\nTommy is now able to recognise the first stages of a flare up and requests an anti-histamine from Ms McDonald, but often he still ends up in hospital.\n\nShe said: 'I had no idea people could be allergic to temperatures before Tommy which I think makes it even more difficult.\n\n'There aren't any leaflets in my local GP so I have had to turn to Facebook support groups to learn more and try and find remedies on how to reduce the flare ups.'", "description": "Tommy Leitch, of Amersham, had to be hospitalised every month last winter, his mother, Abigail McDonald, said.
