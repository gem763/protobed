The lawsuits, seeking billions of dollars in damages, claim the company and family aggressively marketed prescription painkillers while misleading doctors and patients about their addiction and overdose risks.\n\nPurdue and the Sacklers have denied the allegations.\n\n\u201cThis settlement framework avoids wasting hundreds of millions of dollars and years on protracted litigation,\u201d Steve Miller, chairman of Purdue\u2019s board of directors, said in a statement, \u201cand instead will provide billions of dollars and critical resources to communities across the country trying to cope with the opioid crisis. We will continue to work with state attorneys general and other plaintiff representatives to finalise and implement this agreement as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\n'Purdue and the Sacklers must be shut down completely': critics slam opioids settlement Read more\n\nThe family agreed to pay at least $3bn in the settlement and cede control of the company itself, which is to be reformed with its future profits going to the company\u2019s creditors.\n\nOpposing states, including Massachusetts, New York and Connecticut, want the Sacklers to guarantee more of their own money will go toward a settlement, and have questioned Purdue\u2019s calculations valuing the overall deal at more than $10bn.\n\nIn a statement, members of the Sackler family said they hoped those opposing the current settlement offer would eventually change their minds. \u201cIt is our hope the bankruptcy reorganisation process that is now underway will end our ownership of Purdue and ensure its assets are dedicated for the public benefit,\u201d the family said.\n\nOxyContin maker filing for bankruptcy may shed light on wrongdoings Read more\n\nThe outcome of Purdue\u2019s attempted bankruptcy reorganisation and settlement negotiations will help determine how much money US communities receive to address harm from opioids.\n\nPurdue chairman Miller said the company had not admitted wrongdoing and does not intend to. \u201cThe alternative is to not settle but instead to resume the litigation,\u201d he said on a conference call with reporters. \u201cThe resumption of litigation would rapidly diminish all the resources of the company and would be lose-lose-lose all the way around. Whatever people might wish for is not on the table now.\u201d\n\nBecause so many states balked at the settlement, it could complicate the bankruptcy process. The Sackler family members said they\u2019re still trying to get more states to sign on.\n\n\u201cWe are hopeful that in time, those parties who are not yet supportive will ultimately shift their focus to the critical resources that the settlement provides to people and problems that need them,\u201d they said.\n\nKey issues that could be decided include whether the suits against the Sacklers in state courts will be able to move ahead, and what will happen to the company itself. Under the tentative settlement deal, it would continue to operate, but with profits used to pay for the settlement. Another option could be for a judge to order it be sold.", "description": "Move comes days after the company reached tentative deal with more than 2,000 plaintiffs", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/091cafb8eb8d51c28e1c726e6f91c8a1c631ac9b/0_117_3243_1947/master/3243.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=323f51caae07fcca9cf15aa9dd16b11f", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
