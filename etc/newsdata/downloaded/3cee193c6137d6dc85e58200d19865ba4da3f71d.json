Of these respondents, 10% think they're much worse off, while 27% think they're somewhat worse off.\n\nThat might be because many millennials are suffering from stagnant wages, facing living costs outpacing income growth, struggling to afford staples like housing, and dealing with staggering student-loan debt. This combination can leave millennials with paltry savings and other forms of debt like credit-card debt.\n\nIf they identify with any of these financial woes but know of peers who aren't, it makes sense they would feel financially worse off.\n\nEven more millennials feel good about their money compared to their peers\n\nBut while things may be rough for the generation, perhaps the fundamentals aren't as bad as the story they're told in the press. More millennials are positive when it comes to the peer comparison \u2014 46% think they're much better or somewhat better off than their peers (the remaining 17% said they didn't know). If millennials are overall thinking they're doing better than their peers, the situation on the ground may be better than we believe.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the Great Recession split the millennial generation down the middle \u2014 the older cohort bore the brunt of the financial crisis and entered a tough job market, which made it more difficult to save. Younger millennials experienced the recovery period and entered a better job market.\n\nIf millennial respondents interpreted the term \"age\" more broadly in the question, they could be comparing themselves to those in their generation a few years older or younger than them, which may influence perceived differences.\n\nBut these results are on par with what overall respondents in the survey said \u2014 38% think they're much or somewhat worse off than their peers, while 43% think they're somewhat or much better off.\n\nMillennials are just as likely to compare themselves to the Joneses as anyone else.", "description": "Ten percent of millennials think they're much worse off and 27% think they're somewhat worse off financially compared to the rest of their generation.", "authors": ["Hillary Hoffower"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db85437dee0195c4319992b?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
