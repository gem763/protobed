The overall unemployment rate held steady at a historically low 3.7%.\n\nThe jobless rate for black workers last month fell to its lowest rate since the government began keeping track in 1972 \u2014 5.5%. The rate for black women was even lower, a record 4.4%.\n\nThe unemployment level among Hispanic workers also fell in August to 4.2%, equaling a record low set earlier this year.\n\nIn terms of equality, the U.S. economy has never been better. The gap between white unemployment, 3.4%, and black unemployment is now the smallest in history.\n\nThe total number of Americans considered employed rose to a record 157.9 million.\n\nIf nothing changes, how does a Democrat campaign against Mr. Trump\u2019s economic record next year? Front-runner Joseph R. Biden, the former vice president, still hopes that voters will credit former President Barack Obama for the strong job market.\n\n\u201cHe inherited a pretty good economy from Barack Obama \u2014 just like he inherited everything in his life,\u201d Mr. Biden said of Mr. Trump in New Hampshire on Friday. \u201cAnd now he\u2019s in the process of squandering it just like he\u2019s squandered everything else he\u2019s inherited.\u201d\n\nLike most of his rivals, Mr. Biden is banking on the president\u2019s trade war with China causing an economic slump within the next 12 months.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re teetering on a recession,\u201d insisted Mr. Biden, who asserted that the looming downturn is causing the president to become \u201cmore erratic.\u201d\n\nWhite House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the August job growth was \u201ca mediocre number.\u201d But he told reporters to check \u201cunder the hood,\u201d citing an increase of 571,000 workers in the civilian labor force and calling that \u201ca blockbuster report.\u201d\n\nAsked about soft manufacturing and mining job growth, Mr. Kudlow replied, \u201cThese numbers ebb and flow. They roared, now they\u2019ve kind of stabilized. I think they\u2019re going to roar again.\u201d\n\nMr. Kudlow also said that he expects legislation known as \u201ctax cuts 2.0,\u201d which would make permanent the individual tax cuts of 2017, to be introduced in Congress during campaign season next year.\n\nPeople who see signs of a recession on the horizon point to job growth missing the expected target of 145,000 last month, and the hiring of 25,000 temporary Census workers as part of the gains in August. Job growth this year has averaged 158,000 per month, down from last year\u2019s average of 223,000 per month.\n\nThe White House said an economy that has been expanding for 122 consecutive months is bound to fall slightly short of monthly projected job growth occasionally.\n\n\u201cConsidering the unprecedented length of the expansion and the low unemployment rate, continued job growth at this rate is outstanding,\u201d said the White House Council of Economic Advisers. \u201cIn August 2019, just over 6 million people were unemployed, compared with more than 14 million in July 2009 at the beginning of the economic expansion. The August employment data demonstrate that the American economy remains strong, with robust wage growth, a low unemployment rate, and strong job gains.\u201d\n\nEconomist Joel Naroff of Holland, Pennsylvania, said the softening in job growth \u201cshould surprise no one but it doesn\u2019t mean the economy is headed toward a recession right away.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe details are hardly negative,\u201d Mr. Naroff said in his monthly note. \u201cHealth care, professional and technical services, finance and construction all posted solid increases in payrolls. Manufacturing was up a touch as well. But retail keeps shrinking and transportation and warehousing, which were expected to lead the way, has been largely flat lately. That may be an early sign that the slowdown is gaining steam.\u201d\n\nStill, he said, \u201cwe are adding workers at a slower pace that is more consistent with the expansion. But it is clearly enough to keep the unemployment rate from rising. Thus, while this is not a very good report, it is hardly a bad one, especially given the rebound in earnings. Households still have the income to keep spending and I suspect their level of confidence, which has been shaken by the trade war, will likely either stabilize or slow its decline.\u201d\n\nMr. Kudlow pointed Friday to a new round of trade talks with China that will take place in Washington in October, saying the administration wants \u201cnear-term\u201d results from the negotiations.\n\nDespite the uncertainty from the trade war and the lower-than-forecasted jobs report, stocks closed slightly up on Friday, wrapping up a second consecutive week of solid gains.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
