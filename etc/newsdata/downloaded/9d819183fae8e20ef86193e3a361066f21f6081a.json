The estate of the late pop icon - who passed away in 2016 - rebuked Trump's campaign for using their song\n\n'The Prince Estate will never give permission to President Trump to use Prince's songs,' the tweet stated.\n\nThe estate then shared previous correspondence from lawyer, Megan Newton, dated October 2018, which read: 'We write to confirm the Campaign will not use Prince\u2019s music in connection with its activities going forward.'\n\nSeveral people left comments in support of Prince's estate for calling out the Trump campaign's breach of oath.\n\nOne person poked fun at the high turnover in the Trump Administration, by joking that Newton may no longer be associated with the President's campaign.\n\nThe venue was at full capacity on Thursday night, with nearly 20,000 people turning out to see the Commander-in-chief\n\nThe estate then shared previous correspondence from lawyer, Megan Newton, dated October 2018, which read: 'We write to confirm the Campaign will not use Prince\u2019s music in connection with its activities going forward\n\nTrump supporters waiting in line outside as Prince\u2019s purple rain plays. #TrumpMinneapolis pic.twitter.com/fIOmJmI3bn \u2014 bengarvin (@bengarvin) October 11, 2019\n\n'The people you told last year don't work there any more. You might want to consider just sending them the same memo with a new date every, oh, 6-8 weeks,' they joked.\n\nHowever, others had a different point of view.\n\n'I'm guessing it was just homage to Prince and his being from Minneapolis where the rally was being held. No need for anyone to get bent out of shape about it and cause strife. Accept it as an honor and move on,' one popular response read.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, 'politicians generally have the right to use songs at rallies as long as they get a \u201cblanket license\u201d for the artist\u2019s entire catalog' from licensing companies.\n\nHowever, Prince's estate aren't the only ones to go after Trump for having their songs used at his rallies.\n\nRihanna and Pharrell Williams have both blasted the Commander-in-chief.\n\nPresident Trump's posting of a parody video mocking former VP Joe Biden was taken down from Twitter last week after complaints from Canadian band Nickelback\n\nMeanwhile, Canadian group Nickelback last week objected to Trump's use of their song 'Photograph' in a Tweet used to ridicule his 2020 rival, Joe Biden.\n\nAfter Biden claimed he hadn't spoken about his son Hunter's controversial foreign corporate ties, Trump unearthed a snap of the former vice president and his son playing golf with a Devon Archer.\n\nArcher is a former business partner of Hunter's, and both men served on the board of a Ukranian gas company which was being investigated for corruption.\n\nTrump paired the seemingly-incriminating picture with the Nickeblack song, which includes the lyrics: 'Look at this photograph, every time I do it makes me laugh'.\n\nAfter complaints from Nickelback, Twitter quickly removed the video.\n\nTrump supporters deluged Twitter with their own posts of the video and the hashtag '#ParodyIsFairUse' \u2013 which trended on the social media platform.\n\nThe video Trump posted included a clip of Biden denying he had ever spoken with his son Hunter about his foreign business ties", "description": "The star's 1984 smash 'Purple Rain' boomed from the speakers of the Target Center shortly before the President arrived at the venue.", "authors": ["Andrew Court For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/16/19595954-0-image-a-8_1570808052341.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
