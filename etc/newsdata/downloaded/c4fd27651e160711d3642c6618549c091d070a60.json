Indeed, many journalists seem to be channeling not Edward R. Murrow, the fabled CBS newscaster, but Florence Hartley, the author of the \u201cLadies Book of Etiquette, and Manual of Politeness\u201d in 1872. Hartley warned her readers to \u201cavoid, at all times, mentioning subjects or incidents that can in any way disgust your hearers.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFor news shows on MSNBC, CNN and other cable networks, nothing is more disgusting than the mention of what Hunter Biden actually was doing in Ukraine.\n\nFor those brave enough to read on, I wish to dispense with one threshold issue: I was critical of claims over the last three years of \u201cproven\u201d crimes and impeachable offenses in the Russia investigation. However, the first day that Trump\u2019s Ukraine call was disclosed, I stated that \u2014 if a quid pro quo were proven \u2014 the alleged self-dealing with military aid would be an impeachable offense. My point: Raising concerns over Hunter Biden does not mean you are excusing Trump\u2019s actions.\n\nWhat is most remarkable about the paucity of coverage of Hunter Biden\u2019s dealings is the conclusory mantra that \u201cthis has all been investigated.\u201d Many TV hosts prefer to focus on President Trump Donald John TrumpFederal prosecutors investigating Giuliani: report House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman and top Republican to introduce sanctions bill against Turkey Trump lashes out at 2020 Dems, impeachment inquiry MORE\u2019s dubious claim that Joe Biden Joe BidenFederal prosecutors investigating Giuliani: report Trump lashes out at 2020 Dems, impeachment inquiry In marathon testimony, Dems see an ambassador scorned, while GOP defends Trump MORE forced the firing of Ukraine\u2019s chief prosecutor to protect his son. I, too, fail to see compelling evidence to support Trump\u2019s charge.\n\nThere is, however, that other problem of Hunter Biden landing a windfall contract with one of Ukraine\u2019s most corrupt figures after his father took charge of potentially billions in U.S. loans and aid for Ukraine. That is what no one seems to want to discuss.\n\nIndeed, the Biden campaign has been remarkably open in demanding that news organizations stop airing interviews or publishing articles about the allegations. Instead of calling it \u201cfake news\u201d (which is virtually copyrighted by Trump), the Biden campaign calls such coverage \u201cconspiracy theories.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThus, the campaign wrote to various networks, demanding that they stop airing interviews on the scandal with figures like Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani Rudy GiulianiFederal prosecutors investigating Giuliani: report In marathon testimony, Dems see an ambassador scorned, while GOP defends Trump Arrested Giuliani associate attended Trump's invite-only 2016 election night party: report MORE. Kate Bedingfield, deputy manager of the Biden campaign, also denounced the New York Times for publishing an opinion by author Peter Schweizer on the controversy. The campaign apparently expected the Times and the networks to fall in line and bar others from even expressing a view.\n\nMost recently, the campaign fired off letters to Facebook, Twitter and Google, demanding that they take down Trump ads referencing the Hunter Biden contracts. This normally would be viewed as unbridled hubris and arrogance \u2014 except that many TV news hosts are doing precisely what the campaign has demanded.\n\nWhen Rep. Lee Zeldin Lee ZeldinIn marathon testimony, Dems see an ambassador scorned, while GOP defends Trump Ex-Ukraine ambassador arrives to give testimony GOP, Trump look to smother impeachment inquiry MORE (R-N.Y.) raised the issue on CNN, host Erin Burnett cut him off: \u201cThere is no evidence of Joe Biden doing anything wrong and this is something that has been looked into, and I think \u2014 I want to make a point here, I think what we need to talk about right now is what did the president right now do or not do.\u201d Other CNN hosts have repeated the line of \u201cno evidence of wrongdoing\u201d like a virtual incantation.\n\nWhether the energy company involved with Hunter Biden was fully investigated by Ukraine or not is hardly a measure of culpability. Ukraine is widely considered one of the more corrupt places on Earth, where paying the children and spouses of powerful people is routine. Indeed, it is quite common in this country, too \u2014 and I\u2019ve criticized that practice for more than 30 years, in Republican and Democratic administrations alike.\n\nYet, Ukraine was a virtual gold rush for Washington\u2019s elite. Paul Manafort Paul John ManafortSchiff should consider using RICO framework to organize impeachment Giuliani consulted with Manafort on Ukraine info: report 9 conspiracy theories impeachment will expose and debunk MORE made millions working for Ukraine\u2019s corrupt former president, Viktor Yanukovych. Obama White House Counsel Gregory Craig and his firm, Skadden Arps, tapped into Yanukovych, too. Tony Podesta, Democratic powerbroker and brother of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta, and Vin Weber, a former Republican congressman, were implicated in Ukraine dealings.\n\nHunter Biden\u2019s quest for Ukrainian gold took him to one of Yanukovych\u2019s most controversial and corrupt associates, Mykola Zlochevsky, who leveraged his post as minister of ecology and natural resources to build a fortune. Before fleeing Ukraine, Zlochevsky paid Hunter Biden and several other Americans to be directors of his energy company, Burisma Holdings. Hunter Biden had no experience in the field \u2014 but he did have a notable connection to the vice president, who publicly has bragged about making clear to the Ukrainians that he alone controlled U.S. aid to the country.

He later told The New Yorker that \u201cthe decisions that I made were the right decisions for my family and for me.\u201d\n\nHis decisions certainly were profitable, but they were not \u201cright\u201d as an ethical matter, for himself or his father.\n\nJoe Biden has insisted he never spoke with his son about his foreign dealings \u2014 an incredible but categorical statement. The then-vice president flew with his son on Air Force Two on an official trip to China but suggests they never discussed his son\u2019s deal seeking $1.5 billion in investments with the state-backed Bank of China. During the trip, Hunter reportedly introduced his father to Chinese private equity executive Jonathan Li, who was part of that deal. Yet, Biden insists he was never told of any business linkage or dealings.\n\nIf true, Biden was, at a minimum, willfully blind not to ask his son about potential conflicts or controversies. But it does not appear to be true, at least in part \u2014 because Hunter Biden has said he informed his father about the Ukraine deal.\n\nAll of this should be of some interest to the media, which has exhaustively \u2014 and rightfully \u2014 pursued foreign deals by the Trump family. And there is no reason why the media cannot pursue allegations against both the Trumps and the Bidens.\n\nThat, however, would counter the narrative that there\u2019s \u201cnothing wrong\u201d with Hunter Biden\u2019s dealings and it\u2019s all a \u201clie\u201d that\u2019s best to ignore. As Miss Hartley explained in 1872, good manners dictate that you \u201cnever attempt to disparage an absent friend. It is the height of meanness.\u201d\n\nJonathan Turley is the Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington University and previously represented the House of Representatives and also served as the last lead defense counsel in a Senate impeachment trial.
