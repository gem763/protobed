Now, 30 months after Donald Trump entered the Oval Office, the Senate\u2019s new normal for considering judicial nominations seems to be raw, partisan politics that all but ignores the qualifications of nominees.\n\nHow partisan is it? The average Democratic senator has now voted against 48 percent of Trump\u2019s judicial nominees. And no Democrat has voted against fewer than 26 percent of the nominees.\n\nThis unprecedented opposition has nothing to do with the nominees\u2019 qualifications. Compared to nominees presented by Barack Obama, George W. Bush, or Bill Clinton, Trump\u2019s nominees have received comparable or higher ratings from the American Bar Association. The ABA is a useful source here for two reasons. First, Democrats have often said that ABA ratings are the \u201cgold standard\u201d for evaluating judicial nominees. Second, at least four studies (here, here, here, and here) have shown systematic ABA bias against Republican nominees.\n\nPartisan opposition to Trump judicial nominees may be standard confirmation procedure today, but it\u2019s far from normal. Go back as far as you want. During the first 30 months of the previous six presidents, the average senator of the other party voted against only three percent of judicial nominees. Add another Republican and another Democrat \u2013 all the way back to President John F. Kennedy \u2013 and the average drops even further.\n\nDemocratic opposition to Trump\u2019s judicial nominees today, therefore, is more than 16 times what it was in the past. If that\u2019s not abnormal, I don\u2019t know what is.\n\nThe only thing that does explain this confirmation transformation is the identity of the president making these nominations. Senate Democrats \u2013 not individual senators, but the entire Democratic Caucus \u2013 have decided to treat Trump\u2019s judicial nominees as proxies for Trump himself. They have turned the confirmation process into another front in their war against Trump.\n\nThis new battle plan rejects how America\u2019s founders designed the judicial appointment process. The Constitution gives the power to appoint judges to the president, not to the Senate. America\u2019s founders designed the Senate\u2019s role of \u201cadvice and consent\u201d to be, as Alexander Hamilton wrote, a \u201csilent operation,\u201d an \u201cexcellent check\u201d that would \u201ctend greatly to prevent the appointment of unfit characters.\u201d\n\nThrough nearly all of American history, only a small number of \u201cunfit characters\u201d were nominated, and their unfitness was evident from their qualifications and record. For most Democrats today, \u201cunfit characters\u201d are a large group, defined not by their qualifications but by one common factor: they were nominated by President Donald Trump. Period. This is certainly new, but it is not normal by any measure.", "description": "\u201cThe new normal\u201d refers to a new standard or baseline expectation.
