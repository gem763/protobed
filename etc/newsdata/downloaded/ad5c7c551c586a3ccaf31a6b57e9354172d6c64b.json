So, a lot has happened in the meantime.\n\n\"The guys who were part of that 2015 side certainly learnt from the mistakes we made, and hopefully we can improve on that in this play-off series.\n\n\"But it\u2019s not a big focus. We want to play our best rugby on Sunday and win, by one point or whatever \u2013 we\u2019ve just got to win.\"\n\nPollard was also asked if he would be resorting to drop goals more now that the tournament had reached the knockout stages.\n\n\"I'm not going to give away any secrets here,\" he joked.\n\n\"But it\u2019s play-off rugby. We all know the history of penalties in World Cups, so it\u2019s no secret \u2013 it\u2019s very important and could play a massive role in this match.\n\n\"It\u2019s something we are always ready to do, if it is time to do it.\n\n\"I\u2019m not going to force anything. If the opportunity presents itself, I will do that. Any points \u2013 whether it\u2019s three, five or seven, it\u2019s very valuable points.\"", "description": "Springbok flyhalf Handre Pollard says he will take a one-point win in Sunday's Rugby World Cup quarter-final against Japan in Tokyo.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5525/6bd3efd906e34c4782aadef3c028cca4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
