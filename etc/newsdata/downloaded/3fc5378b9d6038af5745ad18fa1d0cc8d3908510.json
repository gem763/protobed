For most people, this has less to do with loyalty and more to do with the perceived time and effort involved. However, the days of spending hours on the phone trying to close your account are long over.\n\nA recent Australian Bankers' Association (ABA) survey found the majority of customers who switch banks find the process easy - and you can currently score some tasty cashback offers and shopping perks as an extra incentive. Here are the best deals you can get right now.\n\nWith the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cash rate sitting at just one per cent, Australians are seeing some of the lowest interest rates on savings and term deposit accounts in years. This could be a problem if you were relying on the interest earned on those accounts to fund your lifestyle, but when compared to some foreign banks, we are still the 'lucky country'.\n\nGerman bank, Skatbank flipped the idea of earning interest on your savings on its head in 2014. Instead of savers being able to benefit from the interest earnt on their hard-earned cash, they have to pay for the privilege, with the bank charging wealthy depositors 0.4 per cent to hold their money \u2013 that\u2019s a fee of \u20ac2,000 to hold \u20ac500,000.\n\nThankfully for us, Aussie banks are hungry for new business and so are offering cashbacks and shopping perks to court you into a new financial relationship.\n\nAustralian banks are hungry for new business\n\nRateCity has crunched the numbers and found some of the best sign-up bonuses available for Australian consumers. So, if you're thinking about switching banks, you'll want to check out the offers of shopping perks and cold hard cash, to stir up new transaction account customers.\n\nWhich banks?\n\nWestpac and its subsidiaries St George and Bank of Melbourne are giving new transaction account customers a $50 bonus, just for signing up. Whilst NAB, on the other hand, is looking for a longer-term connection, offering up to $10 cashback each month with a Platinum Visa Debit Card.\n\nThe biggest cashback currently available is from HSBC, with an offer of a $100 sign-up bonus and 2 per cent cash back on tap-and-go transactions. Of course, this is providing all conditions are met \u2013 which includes making a deposit of $2000 per month for three consecutive months, and you are only eligible for your 2 per cent cashback on up to $50 of purchases.\n\nInsider Tip: Make sure you check the PDS before you decide to move your money. These may seem like fantastic deals, but you need to meet terms and conditions to qualify. For instance, the NAB Platinum Visa Debit Card has a monthly fee of $10, so the cashback offer only covers the fee of the Platinum Visa and doesn\u2019t technically equate to cash in your hand.\n\nCashback sign up bonuses and offers\n\nAccount Offer Conditions HSBC - Everyday Global Account $100 sign-up bonus & up to $500 a month cashback $100 bonus when you deposit $2,000+ for 3 consecutive months within the first 6 months.

Banks are using their partnerships with major brands to their advantage.\n\nConsumer spending is currently as low as the 1991 recession, so these perks offer the banks a way to woo customers, and also offer retailers a chance to turn new customers into loyal repeat buyers.\n\nThese perks include discounts, free bottles of wine and Qantas frequent flyer points \u2013 all for making the switch.\n\nInsider Tip: Look out for bank accounts that offer both shopping perks and great account features like free ATM access, no foreign exchange fees or additional benefits like no monthly fees or overdraft charges. Don't be persuaded by the perks alone, as there are often conditions that need to be met.\n\nShopping perks and free bottles of wine\n\nAccount Offer Conditions Citi - Global Currency and Plus Accounts Free bottle of wine + fee wavier No currency conversion or foreign exchange fees.

Cashback for switching bank accounts may sound great at face value, but the fine print may stipulate certain conditions \u2014 like several deposits and transactions \u2014 to get the cashback and potentially other perks.\n\nRead more...", "description": "It's no secret that Aussies are notoriously reluctant to switch banks.
