When sorting cover for it via a comparison website, we inputted our annual mileage to be 8,000.\n\nThis was based on previous years driving our old vehicle and the fact typical usage is around 8,000 for the average driver in Britain.\n\nHowever, we're now 10 months into our policy and have just ticked over the 8,000 mile mark.\n\nDo you have to tell your car insurer if you have underestimated your yearly mileage?\n\nIt is likely we'll do around 10,000 by the time we come to renew, and thus have undercooked our usage \u2013 albeit not on purpose \u2013 by 2,000 miles.\n\nShould we contact our insurer Diamond to confess? Will it want to up our premium? Most importantly, will we invalidate our cover by getting it wrong? D.B, via email.\n\nGrace Gausden, This is Money, replies: It can be tricky to know exactly how many miles you are going to drive over the course of a year and it can be tempting to just guess. However, this could lead to problems further down the line.\n\nIf you are unsure of how many miles you are likely to drive, the best way to figure out what your mileage might be is to check your annual MOT certificate, which will show the miles you drove the year before.\n\nIt is also worth checking your service record as your mileage will be noted in your logbook every time your car has its annual service.\n\nBut, seeing as you have a brand new car, that doesn't apply here.\n\nBasing your mileage on your previous usage of your old vehicle, as you have already done, is a sensible route to take as it is the most accurate way of predicting how many miles you are likely to drive.\n\nIt is important to be as accurate as possible as car insurance premiums are based on risk. Therefore, the further and more often you drive, the more likely you are to be involved in an accident and need to make a claim.\n\nThis means that the higher your annual mileage, the higher your premium is likely to cost.\n\nAccording to Compare the Market, the average top premium for 12,000 to 12,999 miles is \u00a3566.89 while for those driving over 15,000 miles, it increases to \u00a3692.48, demonstrating how a difference in miles can impact prices.\n\nIf you inform your insurer about the change to mileage, this won't invalidate your cover\n\nWith regards to telling your insurer, it is best to be as honest as possible and let them know that you are likely to go over your original estimation.\n\nIf you inform them about the change to mileage, this won't invalidate your cover and it will most likely change your policy and up the price you are paying to reflect the new mileage.\n\nAlthough paying more is not the ideal result, it is best to make sure there will be no problems with your insurance should you ever need to make a claim later on.\n\nA spokesperson for Diamond car insurance replies: We rely on customers to accurately estimate their mileage when they take out a policy.\n\nGiving us the correct mileage is important, just as with other details on a policy, such as where the car is kept overnight. Any incorrect details could cause issues if the customer needed to make a claim.\n\nFor relatively minor variations in mileage such as the example you've given, we'd amend the policy and adjust the price accordingly.\n\nWhere the discrepancy is more substantial, this could be seen as a misrepresentation and the consequence could be more serious and could in theory reduce the amount the customer is able to claim or invalidate the insurance policy.\n\nHowever, we've not encountered any cases where we've invalidated a policy for mileage misrepresentation alone.\n\nCustomers should call to adjust their mileage if they realise that they've significantly under or overestimated it, we'll then adjust the premium if there is any impact.\n\nObviously, they should also update their mileage at renewal if applicable.\n\nAn Association of British Insurers spokesperson replies: The golden rule is to always speak to your insurer if you know that you will exceed your annual mileage set out in your policy.\n\nThe extent to which this may impact on your motor insurance is likely vary from insurer to insurer, and may be dependent on how many miles you go over.\n\nGrace Gausden, This is Money, adds: If you are someone who has massively underestimated how much you are driving in a year, you could get into some problems with your insurer when letting them know.\n\nHowever, if it is just a couple of thousand miles, as in this case, your insurer is likely to make the necessary adjustments and your cover will still be valid.", "description": "I told my insurer that my annual mileage would be 8,000 but I think it will be 10,000 by the time I come to renew my policy.
