REUTERS/Hamad l Mohammed\n\nAramco is shipping equipment from the United States and Europe to rebuild the damaged facilities, Fahad Abdulkarim, Aramco\u2019s general manager for the southern area oil operation, told reporters on a tour organized by the company to the two sites east of the capital Riyadh.\n\nReuters reporters were shown repair work under way at both locations, with cranes erected around burnt-out stabilization columns, which form part of oil-gas separation units.\n\n\u201cWe are working 24/7,\u201d Abdulkarim said in Khurais. \u201cThis is a beehive.\u201d\n\nAt Abqaiq, a number of spheroids, used to separate oil from other elements contained in crude oil, were surrounded by scaffoldings and had two-yards wide punctures in the dome.\n\nKhalid Buraik, Saudi Aramco vice-president for southern area oil operations, said 15 towers and facilities had been hit at Abqaiq, but it would regain full output capacity by the end of September.\n\n\u201cWe are confident we are going back to the full production we were at before the attack (on Khurais) by the end of September,\u201d Abdulkarim said.\n\nThe Saudi defense ministry said on Wednesday 18 drones and three missiles were fired at Abqaiq, the world\u2019s largest oil processing facility. The missiles targeting Abqaiq fell short, the ministry said, while the Khurais facility was hit by four missiles.\n\nThe attacks halved the crude output of the world\u2019s top oil exporter, by shutting down 5.7 million barrels per day, of which 4.5 million bpd in Abqaiq an 1.2 million bpd in Khurais.\n\nAbout 2 million bpd have been brought back already at Abqaiq and as well as 30 percent of Khurais\u2019s output, according to Aramco executives. There was no casualties reported at the two sites even though thousands of workers and contractors work and live in the vicinity.\n\nYemen\u2019s Houthi group claimed responsibility for the attacks but a U.S. official said they originated from southwestern Iran.\n\nTehran, which support the Houthis, has denied any involvement in the attacks.\n\nThe United States has imposed sanctions on Iran\u2019s central bank, U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday, nearly a week after the attacks.\n\nTrump did not give any other details about the sanctions.\n\nAsked about the possibility of a military response on Iran, Trump said the United States was always prepared and that a military strike was always a possibility.", "description": "Saudi state oil company Aramco said it will bring back by end September full crude output at Abqaiq and Khurais, the two oil facilities damaged by attacks last weekend that U.S. officials have blamed on Iran.", "authors": ["Rania El Gamal", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1432035651&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J1MS", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
