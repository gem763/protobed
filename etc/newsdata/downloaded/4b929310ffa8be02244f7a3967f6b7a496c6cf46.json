He is serving his sentence in a Virginia prison.\n\nBut the Supreme Court delivered rulings in 2012 and 2016 that made mandatory life without parole sentences unconstitutional for most juvenile offenders.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMalvo challenged his sentence in light of the rulings, and the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with him. But the prison\u2019s warden appealed the decision, with the state arguing the appeals court incorrectly expanded the ban.\n\nThe Supreme Court said in March that it would review the case.\n\nThe high court's ruling will also impact the sentences of other convicted juveniles.\n\n\"Invalidation of 'mandatory' life without-parole sentences is premised on the court's recognition that the qualities of youth -- immaturity, vulnerability, and changeability -- must be taken into account when sentencing a juvenile offender because those qualities will typically make life without parole an excessive punishment for a juvenile,\" Malvo\u2019s attorneys wrote in court documents, according to ABC News.\n\nAttorneys for the state of Virginia said the case \u201cis about how and when decisions announcing new constitutional interpretations are made retroactive to other cases that have long become final when those interpretations are announced,\u201d ABC News reports.", "description": "The Supreme Court on Wednesday heard oral arguments in a case involving the sentence of Lee Boyd Malvo, one of the two so-called D.C. snipers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/malvoleeboyd.getty_.101619.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
