Bush at a weekend NFL game in Arlington, Tex. (Screengrab via YouTube/The Ellen DeGeneres Show)\n\nA few minutes into the second quarter of Sunday\u2019s game between the Dallas Cowboys and the Green Bay Packers, TV cameras at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Tex., cut to owner Jerry Jones\u2019s exclusive suite. Many viewers were perplexed by what they saw.\n\n\u201cIs my vision screwed up?\u201d one person asked.\n\nClinton Yates, a columnist with ESPN\u2019s The Undefeated, tweeted that the sight \u201cdefinitely qualified as a Sunday shocker.\u201d\n\nSitting side-by-side in black padded seats with prime views of the cavernous stadium were former Republican president George W. Bush and liberal television host Ellen DeGeneres, an outspoken LGBT activist. The pair was joined by their spouses, former first lady Laura Bush and Australian actress and model Portia de Rossi. At one point, DeGeneres and Bush were caught on camera sharing a laugh.\n\nLaura & George Bush sitting with Ellen Degeneres and Portia de Rossi is not something I expected to see at an NFL game pic.twitter.com/AbWbhXd3RC \u2014 Paid man gets bored (@cjzero) October 6, 2019\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t long before confusion transformed into outrage as detractors slammed DeGeneres over appearing to share friendly exchanges with a president who started the Iraq War, and once endorsed a constitutional amendment against same-sex marriage. Some noted that Bush also lobbied for Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, who faced multiple sexual misconduct allegations last year ahead of his confirmation. (Kavanaugh has denied the allegations.)\n\nThe intense outcry prompted DeGeneres to take time address her relationship with Bush on her show. In a joke-filled monologue scheduled to air Tuesday, DeGeneres defended her interactions with the former president and urged people to \u201cbe kind to everyone.\u201d Bush was a guest on DeGeneres\u2019s show in 2017.\n\n\u201cDuring the game, they showed a shot of George and me laughing together and so people were upset,\u201d the host said in an advance clip shared to social media late Monday. \u201cThey thought, \u2018Why is a gay Hollywood liberal sitting next to a conservative Republican president?\u2019\"\n\nShe later added: \u201cHere\u2019s the thing, I\u2019m friends with George Bush. In fact, I\u2019m friends with a lot of people who don\u2019t share the same beliefs that I have. We\u2019re all different and I think we\u2019ve forgotten that that\u2019s okay that we\u2019re all different.\u201d\n\nBy early Tuesday, the roughly four-minute video had been watched more than 2 million times across Twitter and YouTube.\n\nYes, that was me at the Cowboys game with George W. Bush over the weekend. Here\u2019s the whole story. pic.twitter.com/AYiwY5gTIS \u2014 Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) October 8, 2019\n\nWhile some applauded DeGeneres for putting aside her political differences, critics argued that the segment illustrated her privilege, sparking a fresh round of backlash Monday night.\n\nIn the clip, DeGeneres explained that she and de Rossi were invited by Jones\u2019 daughter, Charlotte Jones Anderson, who is also a Cowboys executive. One of Anderson\u2019s unofficial duties is working with her mother, Gene Jones, to decide which guests will join them in the coveted seats on the 50-yard-line, the New York Times reported in 2015.\n\nAccording to the Times, the goal is to fill the box with a \u201cdiverse crowd.\u201d And for Gene Jones, the \u201ctask that concerns and vexes her like no other\u201d is the seating chart.\n\n\u201cAs if hosting a dinner party, she sketches out a schematic in pencil, always mindful of guests\u2019 interests and personalities, and then solicits thoughts from her daughter up until their guests arrive,\u201d the Times wrote, noting that the Bushes and family members are among the select few with standing invitations.\n\n\u201cWe went because we wanted to keep up with the Joneses,\u201d DeGeneres quipped in the segment. \u201cHis suite is fancy and he\u2019s got fancy friends. I don\u2019t mean fancy like \u2018Real Housewives\u2019 fancy, I mean like fancy.\u201d\n\nThe daytime television host then played a video she shot from her seat that captured Bush making a funny face and laughing, drawing loud cheers from her studio audience.\n\nIn the aftermath of Sunday\u2019s game, however, the sight of DeGeneres and Bush together sparked a different reaction online. The two appeared next to each other on Fox\u2019s game broadcast several times, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care how nice of a guy George W Bush is,\u201d Vox journalist Aaron Rupar tweeted. \u201cHe was one of our worst presidents and left our country and world in bad shape. \u2026 This is a bad look for @TheEllenShow.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t care how nice of a guy George W Bush is. He was one of our worst presidents and left our country and world in bad shape. The mess he helped create we\u2019re still trying to dig out of. This is a bad look for @TheEllenShow. https://t.co/FMYgpbrq6A \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) October 7, 2019\n\nThe Advocate and Out Magazine, both LGBT news organizations, published articles Monday that highlighted Bush\u2019s push in 2004 for a constitutional amendment that would have prohibited marriage equality. Several critics pointed out that the amendment was a wedge issue in the then-president\u2019s reelection campaign, contrasting his stance with DeGeneres\u2019s activism.\n\n\u201cAs one of America\u2019s most visible (and powerful) queer celebrities, Ellen pal\u2019ing around with those who have actively tried to harm us feels disappointing, irresponsible, and dangerous,\u201d Out Magazine wrote.\n\nThis is Ellen\n\n\n\nEllen donates to Pete Buttigieg and goes to ball games with George W Bush\n\n\n\nDon't be like Ellen pic.twitter.com/6ODS0wUXVq \u2014 Aisha Ahmad \u262d (@aishaismad) October 7, 2019\n\nSome were angered that DeGeneres would spend time with the architect of the Iraq War, which The Washington Post\u2019s Paul Waldman called \u201cthe worst foreign policy disaster in American history.\u201d It is estimated that tens of thousands were killed fighting, including 5,000 U.S. service members, The Post\u2019s Philip Bump reported. A much higher number of civilians died during the ensuing years of conflict and an exact death toll remains unclear.\n\nActor John Cusack tweeted to suggest DeGeneres was \u201cnormalizing mass murderers.\u201d\n\nHey @TheEllenShow - how does it feel to watch a game with a mass murdering genocidal war criminal? https://t.co/tIdWrBGFBQ \u2014 Josh Fox (@joshfoxfilm) October 7, 2019\n\nMeanwhile, other people were just confused.\n\nIf you told me George Bush would be sitting next to Ellen DeGeneres at a Cowboys game, I'd ask how long I've been in a coma. \u2014 Matt Johnson (@VivaMattyVegas) October 6, 2019\n\nGeorge Bush and Ellen DeGeneres are sitting next to each other at the Cowboys/Packers game. What is life?\ud83d\ude02 \u2014 Sam Adami-Norgan (@SamRock630) October 6, 2019\n\nIn the segment for her show, DeGeneres did not address any specific criticisms, only saying that \u201ca lot of people were mad and they did what people do when they\u2019re mad, they tweet.\u201d\n\nThe host did point to a tweet she said she loved, which read in part, \u201cEllen and George Bush together makes me have faith in America again.\u201d\n\nDeGeneres also defended being kind to people regardless of their views. \u201cFor instance, I wish people wouldn\u2019t wear fur,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t like it, but I\u2019m friends with people who wear fur.\"\n\nShe continued: \u201cJust because I don\u2019t agree with someone on everything doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m not going to be friends with them. When I say, \u2018Be kind to one another,\u2019 I don\u2019t mean only the people that think the same way that you do. I mean be kind to everyone.\u201d\n\nDeGeneres\u2019s explanation drew a flurry of mixed reactions Monday night.\n\nSupporters praised her \u201cbeautifully crafted message\u201d and insisted she didn\u2019t need to offer a defense.\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to apologize for sitting next to anyone as a guest in a suite,\u201d one person tweeted. \u201cBut you did a great job descalating the \u2018all or nothing\u2019 approach of todays fringe (on both sides). America is diverse and all people deserve kindness and respect.\u201d\n\nBut others remained unswayed, continuing to echo criticisms that DeGeneres and Bush\u2019s Sunday afternoon represented \u201cclass solidarity,\u201d as one user put it.\n\n\u201cSounds about white,\u201d one person wrote in response to the video.\n\nAnother tweeted: \u201c'Look, I\u2019m too rich for his decisions to really affect me.' Is what this boils down to.\u201d\n\nSeveral people asserted that Bush\u2019s history amounted to more than just a difference of opinion.\n\n\u201cDisagreeing with friends that wear fur is not the same as being friends with an anti-gay war criminal President that directly and negatively impacted millions of lives,\u201d one person tweeted.", "description": "\"I\u2019m friends with a lot of people who don\u2019t share the same beliefs that I have,\" the liberal TV host said in a clip shared Monday. \"We\u2019re all different and I think we\u2019ve forgotten that that\u2019s okay that we\u2019re all different.\u201d", "authors": ["Allyson Chiu", "Reporter With The Morning Mix Team", "October At Am", "Allyson Chiu Is A Reporter With The Washington Post'S Morning Mix Team.
