It was the first time a titanium sternum combined with a synthetic polymer had been used to replace bone, cartilage, and tissue in a patient.\n\nIn 2015, the CSIRO-Anatomics partnership saw a 54-year-old cancer patient from Spain receive a 3D-printed titanium sternum and rib implant that was designed and manufactured out of Lab22.\n\nRelated coverage\n\nCSIRO's Data61 develops 'vaccine' against attacks on machine learning\n\nData61 claims its new set of vaccination-like techniques show it's possible to prevent adversarial attacks made on machine learning algorithms.\n\nData61 using machine learning to track human infectious diseases in Australia\n\nThe tool uses statistical machine learning to hopefully prevent the spread of infectious diseases in Australia.\n\n\n\nCSIRO's Data61 opens Mixed Reality Lab in Melbourne\n\n\n\nThe lab will allow industries to create digital copies of physical objects, systems, or people.\n\n\n\nCSIRO using serverless compute to analyse the human genome\n\n\n\nThe CSIRO is using AWS Lamba to allow analysis of the 20 exabytes of data coming from genomics every year.", "description": "The heart valve is made from the same material that is used for Australia's bank notes.", "authors": ["Aimee Chanthadavong"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/27/8d89e735-bfbb-475c-a80a-f1dd197ac591/thumbnail/770x578/3ed0b360d7a3b20b2754eded6326a00c/tria-heart-valve.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
