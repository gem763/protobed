Shortly afterwards, jets wiped out US military position at the Lafarge Cement Factory, between Ain Issa and Kobani near the Turkish border in the retreat.\n\nOn Wednesday Mr Trump backed a Russia-Turkey brokered ceasefire in Syria and confirmed US troops \u201cwere getting out\u201d.\n\nHe urged Syria\u2019s neighbours to take on the mantle of securing the Middle East, adding: \u201cLet someone else fight over this long-bloodstained sand.\u201d\n\nBut amid fears Isis could stage a comeback, the US also confirmed it planned to maintain a small 200-strong foreign the southern city of Tanf as well as a small force to guard the oil fields in the north.\n\nMr Esper said his Turkish counterpart had told him that Ankara had recaptured some of 100 Isis militants who are believed to have escaped from prison in Syria as a result of the Turkish incursion.\n\nThe partial withdrawal of the US has widened the space for Russian influence in Syria.\n\nVladimir Putin, who is a close ally of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, brokered the latest ceasefire between Turkey and the Kurds, which includes joint Russian-Turkish patrols of the border.\n\nSo far around 300 more Russian military police have arrived in Syria, the Russian defence ministry said on Friday.\n\nMeanwhile, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that about 180 vehicles carrying over 1,000 Syrian government forces arrived to Kobani city, on the border with Turkey, also as part of the accord.\n\nOutgunned, the Kurdish forces were forced to strike a deal with the Syrian government to help defend the borders from Turkey and its Syrian rebel allies.\n\nUnder the Moscow deal, regime forces would help the Kurds withdraw past a 32km wide buffer zone along the borders with Turkey.", "description": "The United States is set to deploy hundreds of troops and tanks to guard oil fields in northeast Syria from\u00a0Isis\u00a0fighters\u00a0in another U-turn\u00a0on\u00a0President Trump\u2019s original promise to \u201cbring soldiers home\u201d.", "authors": ["Bel Trew"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/25/15/gettyimages-1166726820.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
