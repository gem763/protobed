She has a herniated disk that\u2019s pinching on her nerve. She\u2019s made some progress, but she\u2019s not at the point as of today to play basketball. She could get up tomorrow and test it out and see where she is and we\u2019ll leave it as day-to-day, but the reality is, I don\u2019t know any more than that. She has not done anything athletic all week other than lay on the table and get treatment and do whatever else you can do with physical therapy.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNo one has more WNBA victories than Mike Thibault. He needs two more for his first title.\n\nDelle Donne, who along with Atkins did not practice with the Mystics on Saturday and did not speak to members of the media, exited Tuesday\u2019s Game 2 loss early in the first quarter because of back spasms and had an MRI exam Wednesday that revealed a small herniation of a disk. She had been dealing with ongoing but manageable tightness in her back late in the season.\n\nWashington had been preparing for the league MVP\u2019s potential absence all week, but Atkins\u2019s back injury was a surprise that occurred Thursday night.\n\n\u201cBasically, just one of those ones, stood over, stood up \u2014 couldn't stand up,\u201d Thibault said.\n\nStarting guard Kristi Toliver said the Mystics\u2019 focus on defense going into Game 3 remains the same now that they know both Delle Donne and Atkins could sit out. Toliver said the team is zeroing in on what it can control.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cStarts with our effort, starts with playing harder, starts with committing to the defensive end, and that\u2019s something that we have complete control over, all of us,\u201d Toliver said. \u201cWe just have to be a little bit better, and that\u2019s regardless of any injury or anything that\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nWithout Delle Donne to help guard Jonquel Jones, the Sun\u2019s 6-foot-6 leading scorer who scored 32 points and grabbed 18 rebounds in Game 2, Thibault said Myisha Hines-Allen could come off the bench to help LaToya Sanders, Emma Meesseman and reserve big Tianna Hawkins defend in the post.\n\nLaToya Sanders has found her place as Mystics\u2019 glue player after years outside WNBA\n\nHines-Allen averaged 10.5 minutes in 24 games in the regular season but has appeared in just one playoff game, playing three minutes in the Mystics\u2019 loss to Las Vegas in Game 3 of the semifinal round. Thibault occasionally uses her when the Mystics need help defending a bigger body under the basket. At 6-1, Hines-Allen is an undersized big but one of Washington\u2019s strongest players.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShould Atkins not play, the Mystics would need to replace a player who was both a reliable shooter in the regular season, if not as much in the playoffs, and a quick, high-energy perimeter defender. Atkins averaged 10.3 points in 24.3 minutes during the regular season, starting in 33 games. In the playoffs, Atkins has started all six games, averaging 7.3 points.\n\nBackup guards Shatori Walker-Kimbrough and Aerial Powers could received increased minutes in Atkins\u2019s absence. Powers started seven games when Toliver was out with a knee injury late in the year and ended the regular season as the team\u2019s fourth-leading scorer, averaging 11.4 points per game.\n\nThibault said Delle Donne has remained upbeat as preparations for Game 3 continued without her. It\u2019s an attitude he has encouraged the entire squad to adopt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNobody else is going to feel sorry for us, so go play,\u201d Thibault said. \u201cThat\u2019s the way it is: Life deals you certain things, you go deal with it, play the hardest you can, and if you walk out of the arena tomorrow and you\u2019ve played the best you can play, as hard as you can play, then you live with whatever happens. I\u2019m okay with that.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nWith Delle Donne\u2019s status in doubt, Mystics vow to be more physical on defense\n\nKevin B.
