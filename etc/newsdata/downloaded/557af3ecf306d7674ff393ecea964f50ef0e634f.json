He\u2019s wearing a black polo shirt and when I ask his age he mumbles something inaudible. (He turned 54 this month.) Earlier on, the waitresses have to coax an order out of him; his first answer to everything is \u201cjust tap water\u201d. But at least he\u2019s at one with his awkwardness.\n\n\u201cDespite the apparent trappings of modest success in television and so on,\u201d he says, \u201cI have always been an uneasy person. I can\u2019t change that. I can\u2019t change that part of my psychological makeup. The slight tension when you wake up: \u2018Who am I? Who are these people I live with? What\u2019s going on?\u2019 But this is why I do this. If I was a very stable person, I would not have to do comedy. Nobody would have to listen to me.\u201d\n\nHe continues his new tour, the Showing Off Must Go On, in November. It\u2019s his first in six years and represents not a departure from previous shows so much as a journey further into who he actually is \u2013 a guy who hates show-offs but loves showing off, who takes everything seriously but himself, then practically self-immolates if he can\u2019t make people laugh with it.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest O\u2019Hanlon as Father Dougal with Dermot Morgan as Father Ted Photograph: handout/Handout\n\n\u201cThe unifying theme is me. Any comedy show, no matter what it purports to be, is ultimately about where the comedian\u2019s at in his or her life. I definitely bring more of my personal life into it the older I get, and now it\u2019s gone another step. It is much more satisfying in the long run to be more vulnerable, not arrive with something fully formed, and flawless.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the latest step in a slowly evolving comedy journey that didn\u2019t really get going for a while. At 28, he was living in Dublin, doing two or three gigs a month on a non-existent comedy circuit, living extremely frugally but also off the girlfriend who is now his wife. (They\u2019ve been together since they were teenagers.) He moved to London to give it one proper shot; a couple of years, and if it didn\u2019t work, he\u2019d go back home.\n\nOf course, it did work. In the mid-90s he was cast as Father Dougal in Father Ted and turned in a performance of such exquisite nitwittery that the show lived way beyond its time. You can still make anyone laugh, from cold, at any age, just with a picture of Father Dougal in his pyjamas. And, if his original standup chimed with what the Father Ted writers were looking for, then his Dougal persona has definitely permeated his standup since.\n\n\u201cThat was my armour as a fledgling comedian, adopting this bewildered persona where I was pretending to be much more stupid than I actually am. I was kind of stiff\u201d \u2013 he does a seemingly reflexive impression of that awkward posture, arms swinging from hunched, nervous shoulders \u2013 \u201cand it worked well for a few years.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018If I was a very stable person, I would not have to do comedy\u2019 \u2026 O\u2019Hanlon on stage in 2012. Photograph: Andy Sheppard/Redferns/Getty Images\n\nHe says his success was all just a lucky strike. He didn\u2019t go into comedy as a career move; in those days, he says, no one did. \u201cIt didn\u2019t attract careerists. It was slackers, people shuffling on to the stage with very little. I loved it. Fame and money weren\u2019t possibilities even, when my generation started. That wasn\u2019t the plan at all. On a typical bill, you would have all sorts of misfits. People with ukuleles. There was a guy called Woody Bup Moddy who used to come on and smash records. So that was his job. It was fantastic. A really exciting time to be part of that generation. To feel part of something.\u201d\n\nBut the 90s couldn\u2019t last for ever, nor could youth. O\u2019Hanlon\u2019s shtick has changed, not just with his segue from being cast as the hilarious idiot (after Father Ted, My Hero) to taking a relatively straight lead in Death in Paradise (which is one of the three most popular shows on TV). \u201cBefore, I hid behind the persona,\u201d he says, \u201cI hid behind the surreal one-liners, because that\u2019s all about craft and there\u2019s a lot of pride in that. But it\u2019s ultimately limiting. It\u2019s better to let people in a bit more.\u201d\n\nThis means engaging with the issues of now. The day we meet, the government has put forward its latest suggestions for the Irish border issue (which seems to amount to four borders), after weeks of callow, ahistorical bilge about how easily it could be solved. O\u2019Hanlon is not impressed.\n\n[I was] dragged out of my bed at the age of seven, my mother screaming, six kids under the age of 12\n\n\u201cFor us, this is existential,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a danger of economic collapse in [the rest of the UK], but for us, we could return to a state of war. You know, people are worried about that. How anybody in political leadership in this country could demonstrate such wilful ignorance of Irish history, and such blithe disregard for the people of Northern Ireland. Thousands of people died. Hundreds of British soldiers lost their lives. I grew up on the border\u2026\u201d He pauses, still averse to sounding at all aerated. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t like to overstate the impact the Troubles had on me and my life.\u201d\n\nBut the impact, it transpires, was pretty significant: the son of a politician, Rory O\u2019Hanlon, south of the border, they had death threats, a bomb scare. \u201cDragged out of your bed at the age of seven, my mother screaming, six kids under the age of 12. I\u2019m not equating my experience with the people who lived in Northern Ireland. But my dad was always out and about late at night, and I could not go to sleep until I knew he was in. There were assassinations, for one reason or another. And I could not relax until I heard his footsteps on the garden path.\u201d\n\nThat gnawing anxiety didn\u2019t translate \u2013 unsurprisingly \u2013 into a burning political passion. \u201cI always shied away from it. I was always detached, I never supported his party [Fianna F\u00e1il]. I always liked him, I wished him well. If push came to shove, I might even vote for him. But I always stood well back.\u201d\n\nYet now he\u2019s on stage, talking about politics from a comic\u2019s perspective. \u201cWe postcolonials, we hold Britain up on a pedestal, as a beacon of sanity and wisdom,\u201d he says. \u201cBut what we realise now is that you\u2019re just as irrational as the rest of us. And that\u2019s sort of the arc of what I\u2019m doing. But, you know, with jokes. As a comedian, you can\u2019t tell people that they\u2019re wrong or that they\u2019re stupid. But you can say, \u2018What you did is very irrational.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u2022 Ardal O\u2019Hanlon tours the UK and Ireland until 7 March.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.
