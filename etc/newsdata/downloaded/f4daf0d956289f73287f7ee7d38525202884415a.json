However, as far as veteran quarterback Tom Brady is concerned, he\u2019s not aware of the moves being made by the Patriots heading into the trade deadline or if they will make any move at all.\n\n\"No idea,\" Brady replied when asked by Jim Gray during an interview on Westwood One before the Patriots was about to take on the New York Jets on Monday Night Football.\n\nBrady said he has no first-hand knowledge about any transaction because he has stayed out of it all year. \u201cLike I said before, I am just going to do the best I can do each time I take the field,\u201d said the 42-year-old Brady.\n\nThe veteran quarterback said he won\u2019t change his approach and would come ready to play whoever the Patriots\u2019 personnel department put in the lineup. \u201cThat\u2019s up to the personnel department and what they think they need to do to help our team win,\u201d said Brady.\n\nEarlier, it was reported that the team inquired with the Denver Broncos and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers about wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders and tight end O.J. Howard, respectively.\n\nBrady, defense carry Patriots past Jets\n\nThe Patriots remained unbeaten in seven games following a 33-0 rout of the Jets in their Monday Night Football (MNF) clash at MetLife Stadium. Brady completed 31 of 45 passes for 249 yards and one touchdown with an interception as the Patriots completed a season sweep of the Jets for the 20th time, 13th under team CEO Robert Kraft.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news!

Second-year rusher Sony Michel also stepped up, carrying the ball 19 times for 42 yards and a career-high three touchdowns as the Patriots improved to 7-0 for the third time in team history (2007, 2015 and 2019).\n\nThe defense also played a key role in the win as it forced Jets quarterback Sam Darnold to five turnovers \u2013 four interceptions and a lost fumble. The defense also kept Darnold on his feet all game as he completed just 11 of 32 passes for 86 yards and no touchdown.\n\nJets newspapers insult Darnold, Jets\n\nThe Jets did not get any respite from the New York media following their latest loss that dropped them to 1-5.\n\nThe headline of the New York Daily News\u2019 back page read \u201cDaaamn, Sam!\u201d with the subtitle \u201cPats force Darnold into five turnovers in 33-0 debacle.\u201d The New York Post was also unforgiving, carrying a headline that reads \u201cBoo!\u201d with the subtitle \u201cScared-looking Darnold sees \u2018ghosts\u2019 in ghastly \u2018L\u2019 to Pats.\u201d The New York Post was referring to Darnold\u2019s statement that he was seeing \u201cghosts\u201d when he was mic\u2019d up for the ESPN broadcast.\n\nThe 33-point margin was more than enough to cover the spread as the Patriots entered as a 10-point favorite over the Jets.", "description": "The Patriots remained unbeaten in seven games following a 33-0 rout of the Jets.", "authors": ["Music Crowns", "Zeegee Cecilio", "Ken Kluska", "Read More On The Same Topic Zeegee Cecilio", "Patriots Betting Favorite To Land Broncos", "Wr Sanders", "Inquired About Bucs", "O.J.
