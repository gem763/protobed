They then found the body of a 43-year-old man.\n\nThe victims were confirmed to be members of the same family, Cruz said. Their identities have not been released because other family and next-of-kin have yet to be notifed about the deaths, he said.\n\n\"This appears to be an isolated incident,\" Cruz said.\n\nAuthorities said they were not aware of any ongoing domestic issues in the home.\n\n\"There was no indication whatsoever and no previous calls that would certainly indicate any type of an issue going on at that household,\" Abington Police Chief David Majenski said during the news conference.\n\nThe deaths were all a result of gunshot wounds, according to a preliminary investigation, he said. A medical examiner would determine the official manner and cause of death. Cruz said he expected police to find the weapon or weapons involved.\n\n\"This is an incredibly terrible event. ... It's a crime. ... A crime occurred in that building and three little children are gone forever as a result of this,\" he said. \"There's not a lot of answers to a heck of a lot of questions.\"\n\nMassachusetts State Police were reportedly helping Abington police in the active and ongoing investigation.", "description": "Authorities said a preliminary investigation showed that the deaths resulted from gunshots.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/police-01-as-gty-190813_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
