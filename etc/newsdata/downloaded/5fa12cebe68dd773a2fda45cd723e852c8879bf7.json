Barrett, who was police reporter for the Philadelphia Bulletin, the term \"Black Friday\" came out of the old Philadelphia Police Department's traffic squad.\n\nIn an article from 1994 , the late journalist wrote that the cops used the term to describe the horrible traffic jams that happened when people poured into town on the Friday after Thanksgiving.\n\nHe wrote: \"It was the day that Santa Claus took his chair in the department stores and every kid in the city wanted to see him. It was the first day of the Christmas shopping season. Schools were closed. Late in the day, out-of-town visitors began arriving for the Army-Navy football game.\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\n\"Every 'Black Friday', no traffic policeman was permitted to take the day off. The division was placed on 12 tours of duty, and even the police band was ordered to Center City.\"\n\n\"Today the term seems lost in antiquity, but it was a traffic cop who started it, the guy who directed traffic with a semaphore while standing on a small wooden platform, in the days before traffic lights.\"\n\nIn the early 1960s, Barrett put together a front-page story for Thanksgiving and appropriated the police term \"Black Friday\" to describe the terrible traffic conditions.\n\nThe name stuck and began spreading across the US, and then the globe.\n\nOther uses around the world\n\nBlack Friday has also been used historically to refer to any awful event that happens on that day.\n\nThe first recorded use of Black Friday was applied not to holiday shopping but to the crash of the U.S. gold market on September 24, 1869, caused by two unscrupulous criminals.\n\nTwo ruthless Wall Street financiers, Jay Gould and Jim Fisk, worked together to buy up as much as they could of the nation\u2019s gold, to drive the price sky-high and sell it for huge profits.\n\nBut on that Friday, the conspiracy collapsed and the market went into free fall and bankrupted everyone from Wall Street bankers to farmers.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nAnother Black Friday, January 31 1919, refers to the Battle of George Square in Glasgow - one of the most intense riots in the city's history.\n\nThe dispute revolved around a campaign for shorter working hours, backed by widespread strike action.\n\nDozens were injured, and as a result the working day was shortened.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nIt has also been used to refer to bad days of battle in the Second World War, devastating Australian bush fires and a peaceful protest in Mal\u00e9, the capital of the Maldives, which saw police firing teargas on protestors.\n\nMore famously, it was the day in November 1910 when hundreds of suffragettes marched on Parliament in peaceful protest and were assaulted and arrested by police.\n\nIf you want to find out more about this year's event - take a look at our detailed guide on when Black Friday 2019 will take place and early predictions for the biggest deals.", "description": "The history and origin behind Black Friday as the countdown to 2019's biggest bargain binge begins - and it has little to do with shops making a profit", "authors": ["Ruth Halkon", "Image", "Mirrorpix", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article6884162.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Black-Friday-Deals-Shoppers-TVs-fighting.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
