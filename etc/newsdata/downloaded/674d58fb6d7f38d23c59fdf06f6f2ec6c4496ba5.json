Folks have openly wondered about Durant deciding to leave the best team ever assembled and strike it out with the mercurial Irving and friend DeAndre Jordan.\n\nBut what\u2019s done is done, and Durant is now on the injured list rehabbing for the 2020-21 NBA season. Meanwhile, the talk recently has been about Irving and his mood swings \u2014 with Nets players and staff trying to refute the story from Jackie MacMullan about whether they exist at all.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThat aside, Durant did have one thing to say about the Warriors that at least let us know he understands the perspective of folks who believe Golden State was a great place to play. Speaking to MacMullan, Durant said that he does not expect things in Brooklyn to be any better than they were in Golden State.\n\nVia ESPN:\n\n\u201cObviously leaving Golden State, I\u2019m not expecting anything better than that,\u201d he says. \u201cI see this situation as, \u2018All right, I\u2019m coming to a young organization that has championship aspirations but doesn\u2019t quite know what that feels like.'\u201d\n\nThis is a nice check-in to the rationale of a player in Durant who famously goes back and forth on how he views his public life. There\u2019s no doubt that Brooklyn, even next season, probably won\u2019t compare to the overwhelming swath of championship hopes that existed in Golden State when he played with Klay Thompson, Stephen Curry, and Draymond Green.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut it looks like Durant wants to build something of his own, and that includes a legacy what has more resources available to him as the top-billed star in Brooklyn. From that perspective, Durant striking out on his own \u2014 whether it can never really be called that \u2014 is sort of endearing.\n\nWho knows if that\u2019s what narrative we will settle on for this time in his career? For now, Durant appears to understand that things with the Nets will be more difficult than they were with Golden State. Perhaps that\u2019s this point of all this? He wouldn\u2019t be the first \u00fcber successful athlete to take the more difficult path even if it wasn\u2019t as certain.\n\nHopefully Durant won\u2019t grow to regret his choice simply because the Nets looked grassy and wanted wear.", "description": "Hopefully Durant won\u2019t grow to regret his choice simply because the Nets looked grassy and wanted wear.", "authors": ["Dane Delgado"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/SxYVmW3HcTrCQd5SqZXO2Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/VEdcLNBybdXRcuObUIqsdw--~B/aD01NzY7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/63976b8bd5969f098ad1fa75d5b34715", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
