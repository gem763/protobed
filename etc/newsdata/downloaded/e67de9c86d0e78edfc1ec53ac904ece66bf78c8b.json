And Baghdadi\u2019s death is indeed a turning point in the War on Terror, just as Osama bin Laden\u2019s was in 2011. It\u2019s just not clear what the war is turning to.\n\nMuch like the end of the territorial caliphate, Baghdadi\u2019s death won\u2019t end the group as a whole, or the threat it poses. The so-called kingpin strategy of pursuing terrorist leaders to defeat the groups they lead has had mixed results historically. In some cases, a group simply carries on with a designated successor, like al-Qaeda under Ayman al-Zawahiri following the death of bin Laden; in others, the death of a leader can fracture a terrorist group into violent, competing factions, as has been observed among some Mexican drug cartels. When the kingpin strategy \u201cworks\u201d to end a terrorist group, the terrorism scholar Audrey Kurth Cronin has written, it tends to be in groups that are \u201chierarchically structured, young, characterized by a cult of personality, and lacking a viable successor.\u201d\n\nISIS is young but famously loose in its structure; to the extent Baghdadi did enjoy a cult of personality, it may have faded with the loss of land, because much of the group\u2019s propaganda appeal came from holding territory. By the time he died, Baghdadi was a caliph without a caliphate.\n\nHis real operational role is, moreover, unclear. Bin Laden, who died in a similar special-operations raid into Pakistan in 2011, did offer direction and guidance to al-Qaeda from hiding, as documents recovered from his compound after his death show. But Baghdadi, rumored to have been killed or injured numerous times before yesterday\u2019s announcement, spent his last years on the run, reportedly with very little contact outside a small circle of people, avoiding the modern communications technology the group was otherwise famous for exploiting, for fear that cellphones could give away his location. He sometimes released recorded speeches to threaten the West and rally his followers\u2014most recently in April. But a spokesman for the counter-ISIS coalition said in 2017 that Baghdadi had been \u201cirrelevant for a long time\u201d; earlier this year, a coalition spokesman told me via email that \u201chis presence or absence within Daesh [ISIS] has no bearing on their current status.\u201d\n\nRead: The \u2018caliphate\u2019 is dead, but Americans may not be any safer\n\nSo why does the United States pour so many resources and risk so many lives in pursuit of such dubiously effective ends? \u201cThe kingpin strategy provides instant gratification, and of course [addressing] root causes is something \u2026 that takes years if not decades,\u201d Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism scholar at the Council on Foreign Relations, told me. Long-term investments in, say, political reform in the Sahel are not going to yield the kinds of results campaign ads are made of. The words Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is dead speak to an immediate and tangible achievement, as well as a kind of justice.", "description": "Killing terrorist leaders gets attention, but it doesn\u2019t stop terrorism.", "authors": ["Kathy Gilsinan"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTR4V68F/facebook.jpg?1572194453", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
