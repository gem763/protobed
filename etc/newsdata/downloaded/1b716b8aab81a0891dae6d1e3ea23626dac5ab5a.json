An intrepid Eibar side raced into a 2-0 lead inside 19 minutes, with the left side of Simeone\u2019s new-look defence quite easily cut open and Charles Diaz and Arbitz Arbilla taking advantage.\n\nThe famous aggression and intensity was missing as Eibar at times dominated proceedings with some long spells of possession. Although Atletico did get one back by half-time, as Diego Costa showed power and awareness to get in behind the defence and square for new Portuguese sensation Joao Felix to tap home his first [of many] La Liga goals.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Bayer Leverkusen They've lost Julian Brandt, but in Jonathan Tah, Leon Bailey and particularly Kai Havertz possess some of the best young talent in Germany. They'll be in the Round of 16 mix. Bongarts/Getty Images 19/33 15. Chelsea Untested manager, untested squad, and lost their only true attacking difference-maker in the summer. The Champions League could go very, very badly for Chelsea. AFP/Getty Images 20/33 14. Ajax Last year's semi-finalists, although they were made to sweat in qualifying this time around, and have lost star players Frenkie de Jong and Matthijs de Ligt. AFP/Getty Images 21/33 13. Napoli Dark horses part one. Kostas Manolas and Kalidou Koulibaly might be the best centre-half pairing in the competition, and they have plenty of attacking resources from which to draw. AFP/Getty Images 22/33 12. RB Leipzig Dark horses part two. The installation of Julian Naglesmann as manager will further stimulate a squad that, if it clicks, can cause serious damage. AFP/Getty Images 23/33 11. Inter Milan Antonio Conte is a shrewd appointment who will drill his side well defensively, and Romelu Lukaku is a proven goalscorer, scoff as you might. Diego Godin could be talismanic. Getty Images 24/33 10. Tottenham Hotspur Calm yourselves, Spurs fans, but it is hard not to forecast a regression to something resembling the mean. Rode their luck a bit last time out all the way to the final, and already flirting with a soft implosion. They may yet turn it around, of course. Getty Images 25/33 9. Atletico Madrid Probably not Atletico's year given the summer talent drain, but Diego Simeone's ability to grind out wins cannot be fully discounted. Getty Images 26/33 8. Bayern Munich Interesting defensive additions, but probably another year or two away from re-assembling themselves for another proper tilt for the crown. Bongarts/Getty Images 27/33 7. Borussia Dortmund Dortmund above Bayern? Yep! Lucien Favre is putting something special together. The re-signing of Mats Hummels shores up an inexperienced defence. Bongarts/Getty Images 28/33 6. PSG Neymar leaving could be a blessing in disguise, should he indeed depart for Barcelona, with the forward line's roles better clarified and Kylian Mbappe fulfilling his destiny as a super-club's key player. AFP/Getty Images 29/33 5. Real Madrid It could all come tumbling down in Madrid this year, but do not rule out Zinedine Zidane cobbling together a meaningful Champions League run from a squad that has plenty of pure talent. AFP/Getty Images 30/33 4. Juventus The Ronaldo project worked, to some extent, in year one, and Juventus are making the right moves to improve the team around him and properly contend in the Champions League this year. Matthijs De Ligt's development will be fun to watch, though Maurizio Sarri's rigidity may hinder the Italians. AFP/Getty Images 31/33 3. Liverpool Right in the mix, again. Jurgen Klopp's side are possibly due a slightly less successful campaign, though, and an injury drastically alters the appearance of such a settled lineup in key areas. Getty Images 32/33 2. Barcelona Lionel Messi wants another Champions League. That should be reason enough to rank Barcelona this highly, even after their recent misfires. Antoine Griezmann has arrived, Neymar may be on his way, Frenkie De Jong is the best young player in Europe - this might just be the Catalans' year. Getty Images 33/33 1. Manchester City Pep Guardiola's City tenure will not feel fully complete without taking them to the top of the Champions League mountain, and they are shaping as favourites, with squad depth, consistency and an ability to rip teams apart in four or five different ways.

Manchester City Pep Guardiola's City tenure will not feel fully complete without taking them to the top of the Champions League mountain, and they are shaping as favourites, with squad depth, consistency and an ability to rip teams apart in four or five different ways. Getty Images\n\nSimeone made his first change at the break, withdrawing holding midfielder Marcos Llorente and sending on winger Vitolo. That move did not take long to pay off as Vitolo ran onto left-back Renan Lodi\u2019s weighted pass and poked past visiting goalkeeper Marko Dimitrovic.\n\nAtletico kept pushing and twice the Wanda thought that Costa had got in behind Eibar\u2019s notoriously high defensive line to slot home a winning goal, but they were twice disappointed after long VAR waits to confirm offside flags.\n\nWith nerves getting increasingly frayed around the stadium, there was puzzlement when Simeone\u2019s second substitute was to give youth teamer Rodrigo Riquelme a La Liga debut in place of \u20ac80 million France international Thomas Lemar. Riquelme, 19, is a talented playmaker, but made little apparent impact as Eibar appeared set to hold out for a third successive draw at the Wanda.\n\nThen came the strangest switch of all. With six minutes of normal time remaining, Simeone withdrew the rojiblanco faithful\u2019s new favourite Joao Felix. The \u20ac126 million teenager had not been too involved as Atletico played very direct through the second half, but there was still general bewilderment at taking off someone of such quality. Especially as the replacement was midfielder Thomas Partey, meaning that Atletico were going all out for a late winner with Costa their one recognised forward on the pitch.\n\nBut with the 90 minutes already up Ghana international Thomas took advantage of a couple of fortunate ricochets and broke into the box to slam home the winner. Cue delirium around the stadium and one of Simeone\u2019s trademark manic celebratory dashes into the ample arms of his assistant German Burgos, before he pumped his fists to the stands and roared to the heavens.\n\nThe Argentine had calmed down by his post-match news conference, when the first question asked whether he felt \u201cso loved, so great\u201d by the Atletico fans but was answered with an explanation of his substitutions.\n\n\u201cNo, because I know the risks you take when you make these type of changes,\u201d Simeone said. \u201cIt is easy for people to say you made a defensive change, and maybe lost the game. But we always live with that risk, on a fine line, and you have to do what you feel. Joao looked tired, and I knew Thomas had strength coming from deep. The three players who entered brought a radical change to the game. It\u2019s not the first time, it happened at Leganes too, when the changes also improved the team. A change which looked defensive to some, became positive for others.\u201d\n\nThe reference to last week\u2019s game at Leganes was apt. Atletico started at Butarque with three centre-backs, but Simeone ditched that on the hour mark, with Vitolo also the first player introduced. 10 minutes later the Canary Islander hit the winner, and Atletico then switched again to finish the game with a five man defence and see out victory in a hard-fought local derby.\n\nSuch tactical flexibility has helped a lot as Atletico are now the only team with three wins from three through the early weeks of La Liga, and sit top on their own, two points clear of Athletic Bilbao and Sevilla. It\u2019s the first time they have been in this position since October 2016, when just five of the 14 players used on Sunday were at the club.\n\nAtletico are already five points ahead of Barca \u2013 who have not been so far off the top after three games since 1946-47. Substitutions from blaugrana coach Ernesto Valverde also appeared to have brought a comeback win for his team at Osasuna on Saturday, when a 0-1 half-time scoreline was turned around by 16 year old substitute Ansi Fati\u2019s flying header and fellow replacement Arthur Melo\u2019s neat curler.\n\nBut a late Gerard Pique handball was punished by Roberto Torres\u2019 penalty and 2-2 was a fair result. With talisman Lionel Messi so obviously missing, Barca have just one point from their two away fixtures so far, and have conceded the first and last goals in each of their three games.\n\nReal Madrid have also stumbled through their opening fixtures. Blancos coach Zinedine Zidane started new signings Luka Jovic and Ferland Mendy at Villarreal on Sunday evening, but his team were reliant on two equalisers from back in favour Gareth Bale \u2013 the second a superb solo effort \u2013 to get a 2-2 draw.\n\nBale added to the drama by picking up two late yellow cards, while attention around the Bernabeu now turns to whether president Florentino Perez will make a big splash before Spain\u2019s transfer window shuts on Monday night.\n\nAtletico got their business done early this summer, and Simeone\u2019s squad now has more depth and further options than in previous seasons. Victories against Getafe, Leganes and Eibar are maybe to be expected, but so far at least it looks possible that the old toughness and character can be married to more flair in attack and tactical flexibility.\n\nThe last time Atletico won their first three games was 2013/14, when they took advantage of below par years from both Barca and Madrid to win their only La Liga title of the last two decades.\n\n\u201cThat year we had a lot more men in the team \u2013 David Villa, Raul Garcia, Tiago, Gabi,\u201d Simeone said on Sunday night when reminded of this stat. \u201cWe are much younger this year \u2013 Thomas, Joao, Lemar, [Mario] Hermoso, Lodi. We need to build now another team. We have lots of kids who must adapt to what we need from them, which is to win, win, and win again, which is not easy. Today we began with three new defenders [Hermoso, Lodi and Kieran Trippier]. It is not easy for eight to leave, eight to come in, and for the team to compete. But the players are adapting and are motivated. We must be relaxed as this will be very long. We need to think each game is a final, there is no other way.\u201d", "description": "Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone\u2019s reputation as a motivator and organiser is well known, but an ability to change a game with substitutions and tactical tweaks has seen his team take early control of the La Liga table.", "authors": ["Dermot Corrigan"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/02/10/Diego-Simeone-has-inspired-Atletico-Madrid-to-the-top-of-La-Liga.jpg"}
