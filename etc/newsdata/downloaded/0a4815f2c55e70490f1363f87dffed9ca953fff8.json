Even though the story takes place in the 18th century, the themes are still relevant today,\" he adds.\n\nBack in London after fighting in the Seven Years War, Alfie's character Isaac wants to take over London. He, and his brother Hal lease a tavern, the Saracen's Head, which serves as a front for their ever-growing pimping business.\n\n\"Isaac is a complex character, and there are dark things within him,\" says Alfie.\n\nIsaac is driven by his ambitions to achieve wealth and power, and this is also reflected in the elaborate costumes and hair.\n\n\"He is trying to appear gentry. I asked the costume department if they could make it seems like he is fancier than what he is. This is achieved through the elaborate waistcoasts,\" he says.\n\nAlthough Alfie didn't have much knowledge about being a pimp, he says that a big part of the job description entails running a business, and that is what he embraced.\n\nA big challenge when portraying the character was bringing out Isaac's human side, especially when taking into consideration that his dealings are rather unsavoury at times.\n\nBut what he admires about Isaac is his spontaneity and romantic side. \"Perhaps if you caught us both on a good day, we would be friends,\" he laughs.\n\nAccording to Alfie, Isaac feels like a natural progression after saying goodbye to Theon.\n\n\"Harlots worked at a different pace, tempo. I worked with different people, and it was a different environment. It felt like it flowed naturally,\" he says, adding: \"I enjoyed the challenge, and to play a thought-provoking role.\"\n\nTheon and Isaac share several similarities: both go down for crimes they didn't commit, have complicated relationships with their siblings, and struggle to find their place in the world.\n\nBut nothing will prepare you for the most glaring similarity of all...\n\nWATCH THE TRAILER HERE:\n\nHARLOTS IS AVAILABLE TO STREAM ON SHOWMAX NOW", "description": "After Theon Greyjoy's heroic death in the Battle of Winterfell on 'Game of Thrones', Alfie Allen makes his triumphant return to TV on the period-drama, 'Harlots'.", "authors": ["Graye Morkel"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9442/427c02d4c4b5492d8f7162bb8f0367c8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
