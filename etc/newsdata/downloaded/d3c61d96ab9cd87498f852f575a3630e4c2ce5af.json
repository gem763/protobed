There is a wealth of documentation of a very dark and frightening past of true events. Not to mention that after spending some time there, what we personally experienced was truly unnerving.\u2019\n\nThe Hayes brothers have teamed up with Doug McKay, Cindy Bond and Michael Whelan to bring the story to life.\n\nThe LaLaurie Mansion is one of the most haunted houses in the world (Picture: Wiki Commons)\n\nThe Hayes brothers are set to work their magic on another horror franchise (Picture: FilmMagic)\n\nA fire in 1834 mostly destroyed the property but before it did, exposed LaLaurie\u2019s crimes before she fled the city. She was never arrested and died in December 1849 in Paris, France at the age of 62.\n\nAlthough the mansion\u2019s interior is off limits to the public, it\u2019s still one of the most popular tourist attractions in the city, with ghost tours making sure to stop off at the stunning yet haunting property.\n\nSurprisingly, LaLaurie\u2019s crimes have barely been explored in Hollywood save for Kathy Bates playing a fictionalised version of the character in American Horror Story: Coven.\n\nPerhaps even more of a surprise, Nicholas Cage claimed to have bought the property in 2007 for a rumoured $3.4 million (\u00a32.6 million).\n\nIn an interview with the Mail on Sunday\u2019s Event magazine, the Face/Off actor revealed: \u2018I once lived in the most haunted house in America.\n\n\u2018The LaLaurie Mansion in New Orleans used to belong to Madame LaLaurie, a well known 19th century socialite and serial killer. I bought it in 2007, figuring it would be a good place in which to write the great American horror novel. I didn\u2019t get too far with the novel.\u2019\n\nKathy Bates portrayed a version of LaLaurie in AHS (Picture: FX)\n\nLaLaurie was never seen again after the fire at the mansion (Picture: Wikipedia Commons)\n\nNicholas claims to have once owned LaLaurie Mansion (Picture: WireImage)\n\nTeasing what to expect from the franchise, McKay said: \u2018The LaLaurie Mansion is as scary a place as there is in the world and we won\u2019t hold back in giving audiences the full effect.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Chad and Carey will have their hands full, but they are true masters in cinematic retellings of disturbing material. We wouldn\u2019t want this diabolical material in the hands of anyone else.\u2019\n\nBond added: \u2018Building a horror franchise starts with the IP, and for us to be able to tap the LaLaurie Mansion, and its twisted history, is a major coup for Faster Horse.\n\n\u2018Put in the hands of such gifted storytellers like Chad and Carey, we feel there are many chapters to tell \u2013 one frightening occurrence after the next.\u2019\n\nThe LaLaurie story certainly couldn\u2019t be in more capable hands as Chad and Carey are responsible for giving us The Conjuring, undoubtedly one of the best horror franchises ever.\n\nPrinciple photography is expected to begin on the LaLaurie murders in 2020.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
