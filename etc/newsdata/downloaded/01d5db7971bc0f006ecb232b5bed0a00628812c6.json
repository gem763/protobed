It was the pace of that spike... It didn\u2019t last very long\".\n\n\"It's all over the place. The market has been very short of sterling so when we have news that is a little bit more positive, those shorts are being covered,\" she said.\n\nThat is a reference to traders taking positions that assume the price of sterling will fall.\n\nShe said markets were now looking ahead to Saturday and the vote by MPs.\n\n\"There is so much uncertainty connected to Saturday,\" she said. If MPs do not back the deal \"that opens up a lot more political uncertainty\".\n\nThe pound is up 5% on the week.", "description": "The latest news, views and analysis from the world of business and global markets.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://m.files.bbci.co.uk/modules/bbc-morph-news-waf-page-meta/4.0.1/bbc_news_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
