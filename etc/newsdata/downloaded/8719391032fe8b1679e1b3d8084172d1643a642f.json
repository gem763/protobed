'You contact [Monzo] on the online chat and they'll just say exactly the same thing, as if they are reading from a script,' she added.\n\nOne mother told the BBC Monzo had directed her to food bank after she was left unable to pay her rent, bills or buy food after the bank had shut down her account (file picture)\n\nShe said she had not been able to speak to anyone at the bank, explaining: 'They've blocked my mobile number.'\n\nAnother customer said Monzo told them to seek help from a homeless shelter.\n\nFinancial crime solicitor Arun Chauhan said Monzo was 'going too far' and that 'the wrong people's accounts are being frozen'.\n\nHe added: 'It seems their compliance procedures haven't kept up with their growth.'\n\nMonzo chief executive Tom Blomfield said that Monzo was no 'more or less exposed than any other bank'.\n\nHe said, on average, it takes the bank 2.7 weeks to return money to a customer once their account has been given the all- clear and that it is 'working hard to make this shorter'.\n\nThe bank said: 'No conclusions can be drawn based on a bank refunding those whose accounts have been closed.\n\n'It does not mean that they have been treated unfairly.\n\n'Without context, which we are prohibited from sharing by law, it is incorrect to reach a conclusion about why accounts have been frozen or closed.'\n\nm.dilworth@dailymail.co.uk", "description": "More than 3 million people have opened an account with Monzo since it was granted a banking licence in 2017.
