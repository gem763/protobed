You see a player who learns really quick at Melwood. Who learns the values of the club and is very polite. He is a team player. You see something special in him. The game is so complex, you see so many different things. We have to see an identity. For each player that is different. We always want to see a hunger towards the ball. If you lose it, get it back. It\u2019s ours.\n\n\"Those certain values should always be there - passion, ambition. We have to see that identity. Harvey is a player who has super play between the lines and can create. You don\u2019t have that many players as an example. We have to see that identity constantly.\u201d", "description": "Liverpool teenager Harvey Elliott is poised to make Anfield history by featuring in Wednesday\u2019s Carabao Cup tie.", "authors": ["Chris Bascombe"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/29/TELEMMGLPICT000212741242-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqlR5zyMJ-WrbyVyY7FYq9O6bQRa8Ro6XZeHm0cQsmbM4.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
