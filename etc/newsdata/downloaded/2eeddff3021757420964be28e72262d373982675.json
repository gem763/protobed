Police and protesters have been clashing for months over concerns the mainland Chinese government is eroding Hong Kong's more liberalized political system.\n\nApple has seen the brunt of the rebukes over spiking the police-tracking app, dubbed HKmap.live, whose supporters say helps protesters avoid being drawn into confrontations with police.\n\nAs far back as 1998, Apple has faced criticism for complying with demands placed upon it by the Chinese government. But this development comes as China increasingly seeks to exert pressure on multinational corporations as the country seeks to assert global power and recapture aggressive growth to turn around its flagging economy.\n\nThe NBA and Disney are among a growing list of giant companies and organizations also drawing blowback for taking action that appears designed to appease China (in their cases, quelling employee statements of support for Hong Kong protesters).\n\nBut tech companies have long billed themselves as champions of free expression and defenders of their users against government abuses. Apple drew plaudits from civil libertarians both right and left for refusing to comply with the Obama administration\u2019s demands to unlock an iPhone used by one of the perpetrators of a 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif.\n\nNow, Capitol Hill critics contend the company is allowing itself to be cowed by China, which represents a multibillion-dollar market for the company and is the origin point for many Apple products' supply chains.\n\nApple began investigating the HKmap.live app after receiving complaints from \"many concerned customers\" and it was removed for violating both Apple's guidelines and local laws, the company said.\n\n\"The app displays police locations and we have verified with the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau that the app has been used to target and ambush police, threaten public safety, and criminals have used it to victimize residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement,\" Apple said in a statement.\n\nThe Google version of the HKmap.live app, meanwhile, is still available globally, a company spokesperson said.\n\nThe Hong Kong Police Force did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nApple's explanation wasn't enough to placate lawmakers like Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), who first criticized the company last week, after reports surfaced then that the app had been banned.\n\n\"Apple assured me last week that their initial decision to ban this app was a mistake,\" Hawley tweeted Thursday. \"Looks like the Chinese censors have had a word with them since. Who is really running Apple? Tim Cook or Beijing?\"\n\nAnd last night, Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) had a rebuke of his own for the company: \"It\u2019s time for Apple to stand up to Communist China. American companies should never be censored or told what to do by foreign adversaries,\" he tweeted.\n\nA Twitter account appearing to represent the creators of HKmap.live defended the app in a series of posts, asserting there is zero evidence to indicate the app has been used to target police or victims, and that the app does not \"solicit, promote, or encourage criminal activity.\"\n\n\"We once believed the App rejection is simply a bureaucratic f up, but now it is clearly a political decision to suppress freedom and human right [sic] in Hong Kong,\" the creators tweeted.\n\nFor its part, Google took down a game called \"The Revolution of Our Times\" that allowed users to role play as Hong Kong protesters. A Google spokesperson said the company has a long-standing policy against applications \"capitalizing on sensitive events\" and denied that the company removed the app at the request of Hong Kong police, as the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\n\"After careful review, we found this app to be violating that particular policy and suspended it, as we have done with similar attempts to profit from other high-profile events such as earthquakes, crises, suicides and conflicts,\" the spokesperson said.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/ff/1d/339ebba748bb86c0b084699955e5/191010-apple-logo-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
