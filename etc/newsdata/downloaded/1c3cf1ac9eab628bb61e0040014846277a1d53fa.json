And Blizzard, the developer and publisher of Hearthstone, quickly responded with blanket punishments for everyone involved. It\u2019s the latest example of an American company caught between business interests in China and western-world freedom of speech.\n\nOutrage over Blizzard\u2019s reaction swiftly came from players, industry titans and politicians. It also came at a time when international attention on the protests and wariness over China\u2019s response to it has grown. Eventually, Blizzard reduced the punishment, but it doesn\u2019t seem like the negative fan sentiment will disappear any time soon\u2014especially after the video game giant disciplined another group for supporting Hong Kong.\n\nDuring a Hearthstone championship match stream on Oct. 8, the day Blizzard announced its ruling on Blitzchung, three American University esports players raised a sign that read \u201cFree Hong Kong. Boycott Blizz.\u201d\n\nBlizzard told CNN that it had banned the three students for six months from esports tournament play for \u201cknowingly breaking the rules.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about the Blitzchung, Blizzard and the Hong Kong protests:\n\nWho is Blitzchung?\n\nBlitzchung is a professional esports player of the online collectible card game Hearthstone, who hails from Hong Kong. He has played in multiple tournaments and according to the Hearthstone esports player profile, he is currently ranked seventh in the Hearthstone Grandmasters for the Asia-Pacific region in the second season of 2019.\n\nAccording to Liquipedia, he has earned more than $20,000 playing in various games and tournaments connected to the game.\n\nWhy did Blizzard punish Blitzchung?\n\nOn Oct. 6, Blitzchung appeared on the official Taiwan Hearthstone stream after the Grandmasters second season of 2019 ended. During an interview with two streamers, Blitzchung put on a ski mask and gas mask, similar to ones worn by Hong Kong protesters to protect themselves from tear gas and banned by the government earlier this month.\n\nThe streamers, apparently aware of Blitzchung\u2019s motivations, ducked down to hide their faces. For his part, Blitzchung reportedly said in Chinese, \u201cLiberate Hong Kong. Revolution of our age.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to Inven Global later on Oct. 6, Blitzchung defended his message on the stream.\n\n\u201cAs you know there are serious protests in my country now. My call on stream was just another form of participation of the protest that I wish to grab more attention,\u201d his statement read. \u201cI put so much effort in that social movement in the past few months, that I sometimes couldn\u2019t focus on preparing my Grandmaster match. I know what my action on stream means. It could cause me lot of trouble, even my personal safety in real life. But I think it\u2019s my duty to say something about the issue.\u201d\n\nTwo days later, Blizzard issued a \u201cruling\u201d that Blitzchung\u2019s message on the stream violated a section of the Grandmasters\u2019 rules that states players would refrain from \u201cEngaging in any act that, in Blizzard\u2019s sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cGrandmasters is the highest tier of Hearthstone Esports and we take tournament rule violations very seriously,\u201d the ruling stated.\n\nBlizzard punished Blitzchung by taking away any prize money he won in the Grandmasters second 2019 season and banned him from playing in Hearthstone esports professionally for a year.\n\nIn the ruling, Blizzard also said it would cut ties with the two streamers who attempted to hide themselves from Blitzchung\u2019s actions, saying \u201cWe will also immediately cease working with both casters.\u201d\n\nBlizzard is a huge developer and publisher of video games, responsible for some of the most popular titles worldwide like World of Warcraft, Overwatch, the Starcraft series and the Diablo series.\n\nBesides the cited rule violation, the most obvious reason for Blizzard to punish all those involved is China\u2019s enormous, and expanding market. Esports is big business in China, with analyst reports speculating that the sport could be worth $3 billion as the government moves to recognize it as a profession.\n\nAdditionally, the largest gaming investor company in the world, China\u2019s Tencent, owns a 5% stake in Blizzard, according to multiple reports. Tencent has also partnered with Activision Blizzard (Blizzard Entertainment\u2019s parent company) on projects such as Call of Duty Online for the Chinese market.\n\nActivision Blizzard is among the largest gaming companies in the world, with revenue of $7.5 billion in 2018.\n\nHow have other gamers responded?\n\nIn the English-speaking world, backlash to Blizzard\u2019s ruling came quickly and loudly from Hearthstone players, as well as other gamers. They blasted the decision, and proudly aligned themselves with Hong Kong protesters.\n\nShortly after Blizzard\u2019s decision, a moderator from the Hearthstone subreddit (which boasts more than 1 million subscribers), decided to step down from that position saying, \u201cAfter four years of being a moderator for the sub and an advocate for this game, I am leaving the moderation team as this is no longer a company I want to support or follow.\u201d\n\nThe Reddit moderator\u2019s post received more than 48,000 upvotes and an outpouring of respect for the moderator\u2019s decision and remorse for Blizzard\u2019s. In the past week, the subreddit has been flooded with posts calling out Blizzard, which have received hundreds of thousands of upvotes. This reaction isn\u2019t just seen on reddit.\n\nA notable esports commentator, Brian Kibler, wrote a long Medium post that tried to understand Blizzard\u2019s perspective, but ultimately told the company he would no longer work on Hearthstone Grandmasters finals.\n\n\u201cThe heavy-handedness of it feels like someone insisted that Blizzard make an example of Blitzchung, not only to discourage others from similar acts in the future but also to appease those upset by the outburst itself,\u201d Kibler wrote. \u201cThat kind of appeasement is simply not something I can in good conscience be associated with.\u201d\n\nFans of one of Blizzard\u2019s other huge properties have joined in to protest the company and support Hong Kong. Players of Overwatch, an online multiplayer shooter, have taken to using the ice-gun wielding character Mei as a symbol of protest against the Chinese government and Blizzard.\n\nThe idea took hold with parts of the internet and has inspired a great deal of fan art, all in the service of shaming Blizzard.\n\nHow have Blizzard employees responded?\n\nThe day after Blizzard\u2019s initial punishment, a group of employees at the company walked out in protest, according to a report from The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m disappointed,\u201d a Blizzard employee told the Daily Beast. \u201cWe want people all over the world to play our games, but no action like this can be made with political neutrality.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Beast\u2019s reporting said that up to 30 people gathered at the company\u2019s famed orc statue in Irvine, Calif. Later that day, a post on Reddit from someone who claimed to be a Blizzard employee showed a picture of the apparent protest, with employees holding umbrellas, which are a continued symbol of Hong Kong protests.\n\nHow have the video games industry and politicians responded?\n\nBlizzard\u2019s decision made waves through some of the biggest players in the video games industry, some of whom reacted in opposing ways.\n\nRiot Games, creator of the another popular esports game, League of Legends, put out a stern reminder to esports competitors to keep their commentary on the game and away from sensitive issues. Last week, Global Head of League of Legends Esports John Needham issued a statement that made that clear to players saying, \u201cWe serve fans from many different countries and cultures, and we believe this opportunity comes with a responsibility to keep personal views on sensitive issues (political, religious or otherwise) separate.\u201d\n\nEpic Games, the company behind the cultural behemoth Fortnite, took the opposite approach. Founder and CEO Tim Sweeney simply said on Twitter last week, \u201cEpic supports the rights of Fortnite players and creators to speak about politics and human rights.\u201d\n\nBlizzard\u2019s move against Blitzchung and the ensuing backlash also caused a headache for Nintendo, as the affair came right before the release of Blizzard\u2019s Overwatch title for the Nintendo Switch. On Oct. 14, the Twitter account for the Nintendo store in New York City tweeted out the cancellation of an Overwatch event planned for Oct. 16. The tweet put the cause of the cancellation squarely on Blizzard.\n\nAs this whole affair comes on the heels of a very similar recent story that pitted the NBA versus China, politicians from both sides of the aisle have also weighed in on Blizzard\u2019s move. Both Sens. Ron Wyden and Marco Rubio tweeted their repudiation of censuring the Hearthstone player.\n\nHow did Blizzard reduce the punishment?\n\nAfter days of silence as the outrage grew louder, Blizzard President J. Allen Brack responded to the criticism with a blog post on Oct. 12.\n\nIn the post he announced that the company would be reducing Blitzchung\u2019s punishment and giving him the prize money from the tournament he had competed in, though Brack defended the cause the company initially cited.\n\n\u201cIn the tournament itself blitzchung *played* fair. We now believe he should receive his prizing,\u201d the post read. \u201cBut playing fair also includes appropriate pre-and post-match conduct, especially when a player accepts recognition for winning in a broadcast. When we think about the suspension, six months for blitzchung is more appropriate, after which time he can compete in the Hearthstone pro circuit again if he so chooses.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Brack explicitly denied that any speculation that sensitivities about China was the cause of this decision is false.\n\n\u201cThe specific views expressed by blitzchung were NOT a factor in the decision we made,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI want to be clear: our relationships in China had no influence on our decision.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Here\u2019s what you need to know about the Blitzchung, Blizzard and the Hong Kong protests.", "authors": ["Peter Allen Clark"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/gettyimages-1031637634.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
