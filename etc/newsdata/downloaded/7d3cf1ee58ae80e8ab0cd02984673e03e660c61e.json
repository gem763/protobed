Get rid of him. And good things will follow.\u201d\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "Alec Baldwin is urging voters in Virginia to punish the Trump administration's \"bottomless corruption\" by voting Democrat.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/alecbaldwinVA1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
