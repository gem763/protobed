In December 2008, the mall, which forms part of a mixed-use development, was valued at just $32.3 million, 23 per cent less than the 2007 purchase price.\n\nIt declined further to $29.8 million by December 2010 but then began to recover as commercial real estate values globally rebounded, rising to $32 million in 2014, and $45.5 million in December 2015 and $49 million in December 2016", "description": "Stockland purchased Cammeray Square for $42 million in 2007.
