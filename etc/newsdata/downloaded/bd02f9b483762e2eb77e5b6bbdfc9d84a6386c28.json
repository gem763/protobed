Do not read on unless you have watched episode eight.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s made a wasteland \u2013 and called it an empire\u2019\n\nRhea has shown some brazenness to insinuate herself into pole position for the CEO position at Waystar ahead of the siblings. She is also inveigling herself very publicly into the affections of Logan, putting on an event for him in his hometown of Dundee, Scotland to mark the 50th anniversary of his life\u2019s work. She has even arranged a surprise party. Everyone will be there. However, amid all the sycophancy of the tributes paid, he must endure some damning home truths from those close to him.\n\nPassing a bandstand on a drive through Dundee, Roy finds himself reminiscing on the death of his mother, but his broken dialogue \u2013 \u201cit was so complicated \u2026 I don\u2019t know what it was \u2026 what they say, you know\u2026\u201d \u2013 suggests a man with barely any vestige of soul who is perturbed by the past. He would clearly rather be someplace else. Lovers of Citizen Kane might suspect he is fixating on the bandstand as a symbol of his humble origins, but the writers slap that down. \u201cRosebud \u2013 is a dollar bill \u2013 whatever it took to get me the fuck out of here.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Shiv is the most agitated by \u201ctraitorous viper\u201d Rhea and attempts to drum up support from her brothers to repel her. But they are indifferent to her calls for a family truce, more amused by Shiv\u2019s annoyance than angered at the usurper. She gets similarly short shrift when she tries to enlist Marcia, who knows full well what Shiv is up to. But she is mad at Rhea and makes her own quiet threat to her: \u201cWhen I lose, the other one will generally lose an eye or so.\u201d Kendall does his bit by having her mention in a toast to Logan his \u201csister Rose\u201d. Rose? This, evidently, does not go down well with the old man.\n\nRhea makes her own rounds, suggesting to Roman that they go into partnership, but rebuffed with a succinct \u201cFuck off\u201d, then trying to flatter Kendall but he is too busy with Jennifer, the star in Willa\u2019s dismal-looking new theatre show, and brushes her off too.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018There\u2019s a persuasive argument to be made that he\u2019s worse than Hitler\u2019 ... Brian Cox as Logan. Photograph: Home Box Office\n\nAt Gerri\u2019s behest, Roman makes a move of his own, seeking out Eduard in a local pub where the latter is engrossed in what Roman dismissed as \u201cScottish kickyball\u201d on the TV. Eduard suggests they buy Hearts FC \u2013 a little present for the old man, a longtime football fan. Sadly, Roman\u2019s ignorance of football kicks him in the ass. Logan is a lifelong fan of Hearts\u2019 bitter rivals Hibernian. He could not have made a worse error.\n\nLogan\u2019s brother, Greg\u2019s grandfather, has turned up at the banquet, a living ghost of reproach to Logan. He also has a message for Greg; leave Waystar or be cut out of the will. Ewan\u2019s condemnation of Logan is a reminder, amid all its familial intrigue, that Waystar\u2019s day-to-day business reflects the actual existing, media-driven horrors of this world. They are toxic on a global scale. \u201cHe\u2019s morally bankrupt. He\u2019s a nothing man who may be more responsible for the death of this planet than any other single human being \u2026 there\u2019s a persuasive argument to be made that he is worse than Hitler.\u201d Greg gulps. But when he tries to submit his resignation to Logan, he tells him his brother is a \u201cfucking coward\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe centrepiece of the party tributes is \u2013 oh, but it is \u2013 a rap by Kendall which has Roman climbing up the wall in embarrassment. It\u2019s not the rap itself so much \u2013 as bad TV drama raps go, it\u2019s pretty good \u2013 but the grovelling depths it plumbs. Is all of this part of some long, strategic game, or a conscious act of submission to his father by a fatally weakened son?\n\nMarcia, too, has seemed steadfastly loyal to Logan, but tonight we realise that her recent marginalisation has galled her deeply. Logan has used his speech to announce his successor. She said nothing to her about stepping aside, she hisses, then stalks off. His brother then sidles up and refers to Rose, a \u201cRosebud\u201d in reverse, it seems, to whom he feels remorseful for some action earlier in his life. \u201cAll those years blaming yourself for Rose \u2013 that wasn\u2019t your fault. This empire of shit \u2013 this is your fault.\u201d Damnation of an Ozymandias-in-waiting on an epic scale.\n\nThe heir apparent?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Shiv and \u2018traitorous viper\u2019 Rhea. Photograph: Home Box Office\n\nThat\u2019s obvious enough. Rhea, who Logan announces as his successor, despite confiding his misgivings about her to Shiv. And Shiv is pretty cool about it. Why? Because she has just been in a huddle with Gerri, Cyd, Frank and others in which they discuss an emerging crisis with a former Parks employee threatening to spill the beans about malfeasance there, who is refusing any amount of hush money, probably has a backer and is about to spill all on TV. \u201cAny new (CEO) face is going to get ripped to shreds,\u201d says Gerri. Shiv can live with that.\n\nNotes and observations\n\n\u2022 Coincidentally, Logan actor Brian Cox was born in Dundee, albeit eight years later than Logan, in 1946. Given that, it\u2019s strange that Logan should support Hibernian, when he had not one but two local teams to choose from \u2013 Dundee and Dundee United.\n\n\u2022 Connor\u2019s presidential bid seems to have run temporarily out of steam. This week, he is reduced to trying to tap his Dad for funds for Willa\u2019s moneypit of a theatre production. Would that Donald Trump had had his level of tenacity in the climb for high office.\n\n\u2022 Roman may have screwed up monumentally in his club purchase, a move that would provoke gales of laughter in the football media, but as a font of acid dialogue he is unmatched. This week\u2019s choice lines include \u201cslicker than cum on a dolphin\u2019s back\u201d and, in a fresh proposal to Gerri: \u201cYou eat me, I eat you, like I do in Germany.\u201d Lines like this are all but the raison d\u2019etre of this show.", "description": "At a surprise party for Logan, the sycophants come out in force \u2013 topped by a grovelling rap from Kendall.
