His teachers became concerned, too.\n\n\u201cYou hear about junk food and obesity all the time \u2014 but he was as thin as a rake,\u201d she added.\n\nThe mother told the Guardian the teenager suffered from the eating disorder AFRID (Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder), which causes people to have aversions to certain textures, smells and tastes of food.\n\nShe said at the age of 7, he began to avoid fruits and vegetables and stuck to eating processed snacks, meats, french fries and white bread.\n\nThe mother said they only realized there was a problem when he began losing his hearing and eyesight at age 14, and was diagnosed with B12 deficiency.\n\n\u201cHis sight went downhill very fast \u2014 to the point where he is now legally blind,\u201d she said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t believe it when we were told what had happened. We are told the damage is irreversible. It\u2019s been a nightmare.\u201d\n\nThe mother said that, despite the consequences he\u2019s received, the teenager still can\u2019t eat fruit and stopped drinking fruit smoothies they were attempting to add.\n\nThe now 19-year-old has allowed the Annals of Internal Medicine to publicize his case to raise awareness of a poor diet\u2019s consequences.\n\nWhile it\u2019s widely known that junk food can increase the risk of obesity, cardiovascular problems and cancer, studies have shown it can also severely damage the body\u2019s nervous system as well.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
