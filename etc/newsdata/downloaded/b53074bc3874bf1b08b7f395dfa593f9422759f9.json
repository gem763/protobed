If we are to change violent criminal acts across our state, we must work together, we must do our jobs, we must support our law enforcement officers to accomplish these goals, and we must start prioritizing the prevention of crime.\u201d\n\nNote what Parsons didn\u2019t say. He didn\u2019t say that in order to change violent criminal acts, legal gun owners are just going to have to sacrifice their rights. He didn\u2019t call for a gun ban, or rationing gun purchases, or allowing the government to decide who gets a license to own a firearm or not. He called for \u201ctargeting violent criminals and getting them off our streets.\u201d The focus is squarely on the perpetrators of violent crime, instead of targeting lawful gun owners in the hopes that there\u2019ll be some sort of trickle-down effect on street gangs.\n\nAccording to the governor, the 25 state employees being sent to St. Louis have a very specific mission.\n\nThe Republican governor said he\u2019s sending a trooper \u201csurge\u201d to patrol four major Missouri highways, including I-70, to help arrest violent criminals using the interstates. This move, he said, will free up local officers to focus on known \u201chigh-crime\u201d areas. \u201cLaw enforcement has the greatest impact on taking violent criminals off the highways when we work collaboratively at all levels of government throughout the criminal justice system,\u201d Missouri State Highway Patrol Colonel Eric Olson said in a statement. \u201cThe Patrol is committed to this plan and working with our partners and citizens to help make the region safer.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s going to take a lot to clean up some of St. Louis\u2019s most dangerous neighborhoods, but it can be done, and if the city can harness the various law enforcement agencies and their task forces to focus like a laser on the most violent offenders in the city\u2019s most violent gangs, the city could start to see some real results soon.\n\nAcross the Mississippi River in East St. Louis, Illinois, however, it\u2019s another story. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker hasn\u2019t announced any plans to send additional resources to the troubled city, which currently has the nation\u2019s highest homicide rate at 111 per 100,000 people, compared to a national average around 5 per 100,000. In Illinois, the governor is focused on things like targeting Illinois gun stores and fingerprinting legal gun owners rather than cracking down on East St. Louis\u2019s gangs.\n\nEven the death of Illinois State Trooper Nick Hopkins, who was serving a search warrant when he was shot, hasn\u2019t prompted Pritzker to change his tactics. He\u2019s still seemingly convinced that the key to reducing violence in Illinois cities like Chicago, Joliet, and East St. Louis lies in making it a dangerous proposition to try to legally exercise your 2nd Amendment rights.\n\nThere\u2019s no guarantee that Governor Parsons plan will bring down the violence in St. Louis, but there\u2019s no chance that Governor Pritzker\u2019s anti-gun agenda will make the streets of East St. Louis any safer. As long as he\u2019s more interested in going after gun owners instead of gang members, the good people in some very bad neighborhoods are going to continue to try and live with murderers in their midst.", "description": "Missouri Governor Mike Parsons says he's sending\u00a0more than two dozen\u00a0state troopers to St. Louis in an attempt to crack down on the city's wave of homicides.", "authors": ["Cam Edwards", "Author'S Bio", "Cam Edwards Has Covered The Amendment For More Than Years As A Broadcast", "Online Journalist", "As Well As The Co-Author Of", "Heavy Lifting", "Grow Up", "Get A Job", "Start A Family", "Other Manly Advice"], "top_image": "https://bearingarms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/5fe9d3444b5ab114a6da837ec32f2a7f1039d7e55057734176_1280.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
