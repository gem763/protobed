On a chilly Wednesday night at Boston Common, he\u2019s speaking to a crowd of more than 500, the kind of audience most outsider candidates would kill for. His staff has primed the crowd to respond, telling us to cheer \u201cmath\u201d when he talks numbers and leading us in a three-beat cheer. \u201cAn! Drew! Yang! An! Drew! Yang!\u201d\n\nWhen Yang gets on the bandstand, he seems to find the whole thing sort of funny. \u201cChant! My! Name!\u201d he yells back. \u201cChant! My! Name!\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s an iRobot engineer holding a \u201chumanity first\u201d sign\n\nYang has been campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination all year, but audiences like this have only started to show up in the past couple weeks. The tipping point was an appearance on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast in February. It was a deep, analytic, two-hour interview, which is catnip for Rogan\u2019s Reddit-centric audience. Yang\u2019s pitch was simple: automation is destroying American jobs, and we need a president with some kind of answer. If you believe that, the robot-obsessed startup guy could be your only option.\n\nYang\u2019s answer looks a lot like socialism, although he doesn\u2019t use the word himself. The centerpiece of Yang\u2019s campaign is a $1,000 monthly check to every person in America, paid for with a Nordic-style Value Added Tax. That\u2019s normally called a basic income, although the Yang campaign calls it a \u201cfreedom dividend,\u201d since focus group testing found the idea was more popular in the language of corporate ownership. Left-wing think tanks like the Roosevelt Institute and Data for Progress have been pushing a basic income for years as an alternative to the current labyrinth of federal aid programs, but Yang is the first presidential candidate to build a campaign around it.\n\nThe Boston crowd is mostly techies and earnest college kids. I catch a few whiffs of weed but nothing unreasonable given the venue. An iRobot engineer is holding up a \u201cHumanity First\u201d sign. (\u201cPeople say immigrants are taking the jobs,\u201d he tells me, \u201cbut really it\u2019s me.\u201d) Farther back, a man named Joe is selling bootleg Yang2020 hats, copies of the \u201cvaporwave\u201d hats used in Yang memes. According to his Etsy store, he\u2019s made 10 sales online, with at least two more made in person at the rally.\n\nIn the eastern corner, a group of four visibly libertarian stragglers is gathered by a green, vaguely fascist Kekistan flag, one of 4chan\u2019s many in-jokes. One holds up a Shepard Fairey-style portrait of Thomas Jefferson bearing the caption \u201cI want YOU to end the Fed.\u201d I present as a reasonable, sympathetic listener, and they seem genuinely surprised when I say the flag makes me nervous. When I first saw it, I thought they might be some obscure group of Irish Nazis.\n\n\u201cOne guy got furious about that!\u201d the larger libertarian says, not believing I could make the same mistake. \u201cHe got in my face and said, \u2018This guy\u2019s a fascist!\u2019\u201d He does a pantomimed finger-point, showing me how intense and unreasonable the man had been. \u201cCome on,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt\u2019s a piece of cloth with some stripes.\u201d\n\nIn the background, Yang is laying out the imminent threats to retail work, already half-crushed by the juggernaut of Amazon. \u201cUnfortunately, the most common job in the United States is working in retail,\u201d Yang says. He\u2019s kicking into numbers mode, but there\u2019s no pause and it\u2019s hard to tell if we should be chanting \u201cmath\u201d or not. The average retail worker makes less than $11 an hour, he tells us, and there are millions. \u201cSo when 30 percent of malls and stores close in the next four years, what is her next move going to be?\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t an applause line, and the crowd isn\u2019t sure what to say. One man near me yells out weakly, \u201cDie?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a very particular approach to things. There are problems, and there are solutions.\u201d\n\nNormally, a politician would be rousing here, angry, but Yang barely raises his voice. Like a good businessman, he acts like his feelings are beside the point. He\u2019s coming back to the core pitch now, picking up momentum. \u201cThe first time you heard about me and the $1,000 a month you probably thought, \u2018That sounds fantastic but it\u2019s too far out,\u2019\u201d he tells the crowd, coming into the home stretch. \u201cBut then they think, \u2018Wait a minute, he\u2019s talking a lot of sense. Cars and trucks are going to drive themselves. AI is going to do a lot of the work. My mall did just close. Donald Trump is our president. I do have a supercomputer in my pocket. He is Asian.\u2019\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s some laughter there, but he\u2019s too wound up to slow down for it.\n\n\u201cAnd all this stuff starts clicking in their minds and they\u2019re like, \u2018Holy crap\u2026 He\u2019s right\u2026 We should totally give ourselves $1,000 a month.\u2019\u201d\n\nOne on one, Yang\u2019s self-deprecation makes more sense. He comes off like a fun boss, ready to make a few jokes to keep people listening, but quickly jumping back to the language of a pitch deck. When I ask him about his unusual rally style, he acknowledges it, but he has a hard time thinking of it as anything but the natural thing to do. \u201cI have a very particular approach to things,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are problems, and there are solutions.\u201d\n\nThe business-minded approach makes sense: until recently, Yang was firmly on the executive track, moving from Phillips Exeter to Brown to Columbia Law, starting one company and serving as senior management in a string of others. In his 2018 book, The War on Normal People, he attributes his success to his ability to be \u201cvery good at standardized tests\u201d \u2014 a weird brag, but a skill that ultimately put him in charge of the test preparation startup Manhattan GMAT. In 2009, the company was acquired by Kaplan, a huge windfall for anyone holding stock. He was 34.\n\nHe was gripped by two nagging questions: \u201cWhat is happening to America?\u201d and \u201cWhy am I turning into such a tool?\u201d\n\nYang stayed on as CEO after the acquisition, but the flush of money set the stage for his next move. He had been troubled by all the young graduates going into banking or corporate law as a default, then growing disillusioned with their new careers while smaller cities withered for lack of ambitious young people. He imagined \u201can army of smart, enterprising graduates building businesses in Detroit, New Orleans, Providence, Baltimore, Cleveland, St. Louis, and other cities that could use a boost.\u201d In 2011, he donated $120,000 of his own money to start Venture For America (VFA), an accelerator meant to build new startups and new jobs in emerging cities outside of coastal startup hubs.\n\nArriving at a moment of tech-fueled optimism, VFA was a hit, earning Yang the title of \u201cPresidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship\u201d from the Obama White House and a spot on the thought-leader circuit. Conferences and ideas festivals were eager to present VFA as a new hope for devastated regional economies, a way to solve social problems with the familiar tools of entrepreneurship and venture capital. That circuit came with immense opportunities, a chance to raise funds by peddling hope to the rich and powerful. At the same time, Yang was shaken by the social disintegration he saw in the cities VFA was trying to help. Detroit was still dying, and more cities were joining it each year, collapsing into drug addiction, poverty, and despair. The world of TED Talks and cocktail parties didn\u2019t seem capable of doing anything about it \u2014 himself included. In his book, he says he was gripped by two nagging questions: \u201cWhat the heck is happening to the United States?\u201d and \u201cWhy am I becoming such a tool?\u201d\n\nThe numbers show us losing everything that makes us human: our intelligence, our sense of purpose, and our will to live\n\nWhen I ask Yang about that period, his frustration starts to show through. \u201cImagine being this celebrated entrepreneur,\u201d he says, \u201cand then feeling like your work is like a wall of sand in front of a tidal wave. And people keep asking, \u2018How did you build the wall of sand?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the things I pride myself on is a degree of intellectual honesty,\u201d he continues. \u201cSo then if you say, \u2018I honestly do not believe that I am solving the problem doing the work that I am doing,\u2019 then you have to go to the drawing board and say, \u2018How would I solve that set of problems?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe set of problems has hardened into a set of bleak statistics about America, which Yang summons up at a moment\u2019s notice. The story starts with economics: The top 1 percent of earners have accrued more than half of US income growth over the past decade. Only 63 percent of Americans are actively engaged in full-time work, a number that\u2019s stayed flat since 2014 while the nominal unemployment rate has plummeted. 62 percent of Americans say they wouldn\u2019t be able to cover an emergency medical bill of $1,000 or more. One of Yang\u2019s favorite statistics is that persistent financial insecurity lowers a person\u2019s IQ by 13 points, making us more impulsive, less creative, and angrier.\n\nThat financial desperation is already destroying lives. For the first time in over a century, US life expectancy has declined for three years running, driven by a rise in opioid overdoses and suicides. A 2017 paper explored an unusual spike in the death rates of white men between 50 and 55, who had become 5 percent more likely to die from alcohol, drug use, or suicide since 2000. (Morbidity researchers classify these as \u201cdeaths of despair.\u201d) Taken together, the numbers show us losing everything that makes us human: our intelligence, our sense of purpose, and, finally, our will to live.\n\nBehind all of it, Yang sees automation, driven by the unstoppable will of the market. The story starts with the decline of American manufacturing, something politicians are used to talking about. But Yang thinks that decline is driven less by globalization and more by automated assembly lines, which have allowed the sector to maintain roughly the same output levels as 2007 while dropping nearly a million jobs. In a few years, self-driving freight trucks will follow, unlocking tens of billions of dollars for investors and displacing millions of truck drivers, to be followed shortly by cab drivers, clerks, service workers, and radiologists. There will be no profit motive to reintegrate them, no training program that can make their skills valuable again. Yang predicts an epidemic of depreciating human capital hitting profession after profession until society disintegrates, overwhelmed by the sheer volume of human despair.\n\n\u201cThe end state looks unthinkably terrible.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s grim, with obvious echoes of Marx (who was writing about automation too). But where Marx saw a struggle between discrete classes, Yang sees a tidal wave hitting group after group in sequence. In his reading, no one is safe and we\u2019re all in it together. \u201cRelying on the market is going to get more and more destructive as it zeroes out more and more people,\u201d he says, \u201cunless we come together and build a different kind of economy as fast as possible. And the first concrete step in that direction is to give everyone $1,000 a month in cash.\u201d\n\nThat unremitting bleakness has led some of the more rabid online fans to name Yang as the \u201cchaos candidate,\u201d a title previously held by Donald Trump. It\u2019s an \u201caccelerationist\u201d idea, working from the premise that the present society cannot be saved. For accelerationists, the most humane course of action is to bring about collapse as quickly as possible, like ripping off a Band-Aid, to prepare for the next societal order.\n\nI explain the idea to Yang, who seems to be hearing it for the first time.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s highly interesting,\u201d he says. \u201cIs there a view of what that end state looks like?\u201d\n\nI tell him it\u2019s hazy at best.\n\n\u201cMy choices are to watch the society come apart or try and galvanize energy around meaningful solutions.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause to me, the end state looks unthinkably terrible,\u201d he says, loading up the mental cache of numbers again. \u201cEven now, we have an epidemic not just of drug overdoses, but of anxiety, depression, and mental health problems. If you load pervasive financial insecurity and scarcity on top, you will have a population that starts dying younger, is less rational, does not know what to do.\u201d\n\nHe is looking off to the side in concentration now, his voice still low but more forceful. \u201cPeople think Donald Trump is a problem. No, Donald Trump is a symptom of this ongoing transformation,\u201d he says. \u201cThe path from here to figuring it out is fraught with a lot of misery and suffering. And right now, our political feedback mechanism in this country is breaking down... So the accelerationism idea, it might be satisfying, but do we really want to sit around and watch our society come apart?\u201d\n\nA politician\u2019s sincerity is always in doubt, and Yang is more doubtable than most. This is his first campaign, his first venture in electoral politics of any kind. Before 2017, he had no history of anti-capitalist activism. It\u2019s easy to paint him as a vanity candidate who is indulging in fashionable socialism to build his thought-leader credentials, like a smarter, more detail-oriented Howard Schultz. But describing this collapse in person, Yang seems genuinely shaken and moved to do something \u2014 anything \u2014 to stave off the collapse. If his campaign comes off as doomed or absurd, it\u2019s simply because he didn\u2019t know what else to do.\n\n\u201cThat is literally what drove me to run for president,\u201d Yang says. \u201cI thought to myself, realistically, my choices are to watch the society come apart or try and galvanize energy around meaningful solutions.\u201d\n\nWhen I visit the Yang campaign in March, it\u2019s in the middle of a fundraising tear, with more than $2 million raised including high-profile donations from Jack Dorsey, Noah Centineo, and Nicolas Cage. But the campaign still does most of its work out of a small office in New York\u2019s Garment district, sharing the floor with a math-tutoring business and at least three fashion companies. One corner of the office has become a make-shift supply closet, stacked with coat hangers, tripods, brochures, and \u201cYang2020\u201d bumper stickers.\n\nIt\u2019s the deputy campaign manager\u2019s second week on the job and another staffer\u2019s second day. The new bodies are sorely needed: the campaign is still unwinding from a visit to Al Sharpton\u2019s National Action Network, where Yang had spoken alongside Eric Holder, Tom Perez, and Stacey Abrams. He\u2019d arrived with only one campaign worker, which the team realized too late had left no comms staffer to hand out business cards and make connections with potential supporters and donors at the event.\n\n\u201cOnce we secure the bag,\u201d the caption reads, \u201cI can quit my job and rap about Harambe.\u201d\n\nOnline, the landscape seems more favorable. Yang\u2019s CNN town hall was announced just a few days earlier, and the meme crew quickly noted it would be on the same day as the return of Game of Thrones. The campaign\u2019s digital director Andrew Frawley saw the chatter and started thinking about how to play off it, something that would get some viral lift. What if they put Yang on the Iron Throne, with a caption, \u201cThe Robots Are Coming\u201d? There is an Iron Throne at the HBO Shop in Bryant Park, just a few blocks west. It would be easy enough to get a Jon Snow-style fur coat to drive the point home. Campaign manager Zach Graumann nixes the coat as off brand. Does he really need a photo at all? Photoshop would be faster and more authentic, and lots of online supporters are happy to do some quick cut-and-paste work on behalf of the campaign. The final product arrives a few days later on Yang\u2019s Instagram and Twitter accounts, presenting the town hall and GoT premiere at 8PM and 9PM, like a two-hour doubleheader.\n\nIf that seems corny, it\u2019s nothing compared to most of the Yang memes out there. A turn through the #YangGang Twitter tag shows a crying MAGA-hat Wojak finding comfort in a vaporwave Yang hat and a $1,000 bill. Another shows a blunt-smoking Elon Musk, with ghostly overlays of Harambe (a beloved gorilla slain by zookeepers in Cincinnati) and a Bombay Sapphire bottle. \u201cOnce we secure the bag,\u201d the caption reads, \u201cI can quit my job and rap about Harambe.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re under the age of 25, your first awareness of Andrew Yang probably came from an image like this, dropped in a Discord channel or a Reddit thread. For reasons that seem unclear even to the campaign, Yang has become the meme candidate. Most of the memes revolve around the promise of $1,000, simple enough to be the punchline at the bottom of an image macro.\n\nBy now, people make Yang memes because they\u2019ve seen Yang memes. Some outsiders wonder if the campaign is secretly behind the meme explosion, but Frawley tells me he has little to do with most of what\u2019s out there. Still, they do what they can to boost the good ones. The campaign merchandise is full of meme-y in-jokes, including Bitmoji bumper stickers of Yang\u2019s face and tote bags reading \u201cSecure the bag,\u201d all boosted through the campaigns official accounts.\n\nFrawley is skeptical of Facebook, seeing it as useful mostly for reaching an older audience, and only when the campaign is willing to pay. Most importantly, it\u2019s not where Yang\u2019s young supporters are spending their time. \u201cMost of our under-35 reach out is Twitter and Instagram,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s really Boomers and Gen-X that have embraced Facebook.\u201d\n\nSometimes, when you put an idea into the world, you lose control of what it means\n\nSometimes, the enthusiasm goes somewhere uglier. 4chan\u2019s /pol/ board seized on Yang after the Rogan interview too, and some of the subsequent memes were shot through with anti-Semitism, showing Jewish bankers and other gleefully racist /pol/ cartoons. When I first wrote about the racist memes, Yang was quick to push back, telling me frankly, \u201cfor anyone with this agenda, we do not want your support.\u201d But the trolls haven\u2019t been so easy to shake. Weeks later, the campaign scrambled to cut ties with a far-right podcaster who had worked his way onto the Michigan volunteer staff. At CNN\u2019s town hall, the moderator told Yang straight out, \u201cWhite nationalists are supporting you online,\u201d even as he tried to distance himself. The next morning, a tweet tagged as \u201c#YangGang for #SystemCollapse\u201d showed the candidate Photoshopped into a Nazi salute, with anti-Semitic slurs and clown-wigged Pepe frogs pasted below. Soaked with toxic irony, it was hard to tell if the tweet was attacking Yang or supporting him.\n\nThis tornado seems to have caught the campaign off-guard, but it didn\u2019t come out of nowhere. An outsider candidate, Yang has embraced outsider media. That approach started with the Rogan appearance, but it carried over to later interviews with Sam Harris and Ben Shapiro, both of whom often walk the line between earnest skepticism and neo-reactionary racism. In one campaign video, Yang uses his usual matter-of-fact tone to describe the shrinking of the white population, driven by declining birth rates and the raging opioid crisis. This logic can be a dog whistle to white nationalists, a signal that someone secretly shares their view that the white race is under attack.\n\nWhen I tell Yang that, he is alarmed. \u201cI never really set out to talk to a specific group,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is going to have an impact on all of us.\u201d\n\nSometimes, when you put an idea into the world \u2014 or, more specifically, the internet \u2014 you lose control of what it means. Yang has succeeded so far by throwing out as many new ideas as possible: not just basic income, but federal marriage counseling, campaigning by hologram, backing off on medical circumcision, implementing new nuclear launch fail-safes, seemingly anything he decides is a good idea. It\u2019s a conscious break from the narrow, unimaginative grind of professional politics. But campaigning is about people as much as ideas, and the right idea can sometimes come with the wrong people. And then, sometimes those people Photoshop a joint into your mouth and caption it \u201cYang Weed\u2026Gamers Rise Up.\u201d\n\nThe day after the rally, Yang is back in New York, meeting with staff. We\u2019ve arranged a photo shoot in the campaign\u2019s new office space. It\u2019s two floors above the main office and completely bare, rented out to accommodate the rush of incoming staffers.\n\nYang is tired, but he\u2019s in a good mood. He\u2019s been watching a documentary about disgraced Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, who visited the Obama White House with Yang in 2012 as a Champion of Change. A few interviewers have asked him about Holmes, and he hasn\u2019t been sure what to say. \u201cSome people are odd and impressive,\u201d he says. \u201cShe just seemed odd.\u201d\n\nYang has surged ahead in the polls. The most recent numbers put him at 3 percent, tied with Juli\u00e1n Castro and ahead of party favorites like Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar. He\u2019s eighth in a field of twenty, and Nate Silver, icon to political professionals everywhere, has gone on record saying, \u201cWe actually can\u2019t discount the possibility that Andrew Yang will just grow and grow and take the whole thing.\u201d The campaign likes the quote so much that they print it out at poster size and tape it to the wall.\n\n\u201cAre you pulling my leg?\u201d\n\nThe main elevator is out, so when we\u2019re finished, we take the freight elevator to back down. Waiting outside, one of the other tenants, an older man with gray hair and a heavy New York accent, sees the camera equipment and asks what\u2019s up. We say we\u2019re taking photos of Mr. Yang.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s Mr. Yang?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d says Yang.\n\nThis only makes the man more confused. A staffer pipes in that Yang is running for president.\n\n\u201cOf the United States?\u201d\n\nWe assure him that it\u2019s true. He knows most of the tenants, but, of course, the campaign is new, and something doesn\u2019t seem to be clicking. He knows about the primary race, surely, but this guy in front of him just doesn\u2019t seem like the type. There\u2019s a pause. He seems worried he might be on some kind of hidden-camera show, roped into a gag he doesn\u2019t yet understand.\n\n\u201cAre you pulling my leg?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get the word out,\u201d Yang says, as amused as anyone. \u201cWatch CNN on Sunday. You\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nAnother pause. \u201cFor president?\u201d", "description": "He\u2019s a fringe Democratic candidate who thinks automation is the country\u2019s greatest threat, and the answer is to give every American human $1,000 a month.", "authors": ["Russell Brandom", "Apr"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/13ISNGqzTkuMBlCRBg_Qq1o5c0Y=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16125246/akrales_190411_3346_0152.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-17"}
