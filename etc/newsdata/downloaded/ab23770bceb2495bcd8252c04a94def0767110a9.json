But the full 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Tuesday it will hear the case again, with all the judges sitting.\n\nIt scheduled oral argument for Dec. 12.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision by the Fourth Circuit granting the District of Columbia and Maryland a rehearing in our anti-corruption case against President Trump is significant,\u201d said D.C. Attorney General Karl A. Racine and Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh, who are fighting Mr. Trump in the lawsuit.\n\nThe three-judge panel had said neither D.C. nor Maryland had standing to bring the suit. The judges did not rule on the merits of the case against the president.\n\nThat didn\u2019t stop Mr. Trump from gloating at the time, proclaiming a \u201cunanimous decision in my favor.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has kept his ownership in his business empire, though he has turned over day-to-day operations to his children.\n\nHis political opponents say he\u2019s enriching himself through money U.S. government officials and foreign officials pay for rooms, bar tabs and other expenses at his properties, such as the Trump International hotel in Washington, D.C.\n\nThat, they say, violates the \u201cEmoluments Clauses\u201d of the Constitution, which restrict the president from making money off the federal government beyond his official salary, and restrict him from accepting things of value from foreign governments.\n\nThe D.C. and Maryland lawsuit is one of a series of challenges to the president over the Emoluments matter.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
