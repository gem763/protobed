We\u2019re very excited about the possibilities with this new technology and we encourage everybody to get in touch with us and give it a try.\u201d\n\nThe Thelma & Louise star runs the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, a group she founded in 2004 to advocate for gender representation in Hollywood.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one category of gross gender inequality where the underrepresentation of women can be fixed absolutely overnight \u2014 and it\u2019s onscreen,\u201d Davis said at the New Zealand event. \u201cThe very next project somebody makes \u2014 the next movie, TV show \u2014 can be gender-balanced. We can make this change happen very fast. In the time it takes to create a new show or a new film, we can present a whole new vision of the future.\u201d\n\nDavis reportedly said that the goal of the new application is not to \u201cshame and blame,\u201d but instead to reveal unconscious bias.\n\nFollow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg.
