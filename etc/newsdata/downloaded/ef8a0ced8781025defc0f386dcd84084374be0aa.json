Injured. Carson Wentz? Work in progress. Matt Ryan? Got stats, not wins. Jared Goff? Can\u2019t yet carry a team. Aaron Rodgers? Still da man, but currently uncomfortable in Coach Matt LaFleur\u2019s offense.\n\nRussell Wilson? The best he has ever been.\n\nIt is a most frightening no-brainer in modern NFL business, handing over gobs of money to a franchise quarterback. Teams can\u2019t manage the salary cap easily with them; they can\u2019t win without them. So they must pay and then pray. It\u2019s almost accepted now that a franchise must do all its ascending when the quarterback is young and making a digestible salary. When it\u2019s time to pay him money that resets the ever-robust QB market, the next phase is more about sustaining a lower level of success. It is about leveraging the quarterback\u2019s talent to build a consistent winner that, while lacking a high ceiling, still tries to compete for a championship by hanging in and hoping to be in the right place at the right time.\n\n[How Gardner Minshew went from college nomad to mustachioed cult hero to NFL\u2019s top rookie]\n\nThe downgrade is from \u201canything is possible\u201d to, hopefully, \u201cwe\u2019ll always have a chance because of our franchise quarterback.\u201d This is better than starting over because it is so hard to find a long-term solution at the most difficult position to play in team sports.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t always have to feel like settling, however. As evidence, we present Wilson, the 30-year-old Seattle Seahawks quarterback, who is off to the best start in his career a few months after signing the third and most lucrative contract of his career. His team is 4-1, which matches the best start in franchise history. On Thursday, the Seahawks outlasted the defending NFC champion Los Angeles Rams, 30-29, on an emotional and taxing night in which they inducted their late owner, Paul Allen, into their ring of honor.\n\nIn five games, Wilson has staked his claim as a legitimate MVP candidate. If not for Patrick Mahomes\u2019s extraterrestrial talent, Wilson would be the talk of the NFL. His statistics are a ridiculous testament to productivity and efficiency. The numbers to know: 1,409 yards, 12 touchdowns, zero interceptions, 126.3 passer rating, 9.0 yards per attempt, completing 73.1 percent of his passes.\n\nAccording to the NFL, Wilson is the first quarterback in the Super Bowl era to throw for at least 1,400 yards, 12 touchdowns and no interceptions through his team\u2019s first five games. On Sunday, Mahomes will have the chance to match the feat. But no one in the NFL does as much with so few passing attempts as Wilson. He makes everything count.\n\nOn Thursday, Goff threw 49 passes and amassed 395 yards. But Wilson stole the show and willed Seattle to victory by completing 17 of 23 passes for 268 yards and four touchdowns. He was a creative genius, escaping danger and slinging the pigskin all over CenturyLink Field, exhibiting a rare combination of aggressive, let-it-fly performance and flawless ball protection.\n\n[Finding the next Sean McVay has proved elusive as losses pile up for first-year coaches]\n\nWilson made at least a half-dozen plays, with his arm and with his feet, that no quarterback should be capable of, not even someone with his history of Houdini highlights. All of his touchdowns were gems. But the first score, a 13-yard strike to Tyler Lockett, left a stadium and entire national television audience in awe.\n\nIt felt like a 73-yard pass, considering all that Wilson did to make it happen. He was flushed out of the pocket, sprinted to his left and then released a pass while on the run as defenders chased him. From the angle he threw, there seemed to be no chance for a completion.\n\n\u201cI thought he was throwing it away,\u201d center Justin Britt said.\n\nWilson doesn\u2019t give up on plays, though. He was actually throwing the football to Lockett in the corner of the end zone. It required arm strength and touch and accuracy while on the move. There were only a few inches of space to make the completion. Wilson made the throw, and Lockett caught it and stayed in bounds with an epic toe-tap.\n\n\u201cWhen he threw it, I knew he was throwing it to me,\u201d Lockett said. \u201cI knew he was giving me a chance.\u201d\n\nFor all of Wilson\u2019s accomplishments, this season might end up being considered the ultimate breakthrough. In his eight seasons in Seattle, Wilson hasn\u2019t had a losing year. He won the Super Bowl in his second season and advanced to another the next year. He has been to six Pro Bowls. But there has always been an assumption that he had at least one more gear. That\u2019s why the Seahawks had no choice but to make him the highest-paid player in NFL history in April.\n\nHis four-year, $140 million contract breaks down to $35 million per season. It includes $107 million in guaranteed pay, which forces the Seahawks to make some hard roster decisions and perhaps cut a few corners to comply with the salary cap. But, interestingly, his rising salary isn\u2019t anchoring the team to mediocrity.\n\n[Best bets for NFL Week 5: Count on the Cowboys, Steelers and Raiders]\n\nRight now, they\u2019re still in a good-not-great phase, but the recent trade for defensive end Jadeveon Clowney improved their top-end talent. They expect to have 10 draft picks in April and a cap situation in which they could re-sign Clowney and pursue another major piece in free agency. They still have work to do, and even though they\u2019re 4-1, they aren\u2019t overpowering. Three of their victories have come by a combined four points.\n\n\u201cOur record could definitely be a lot different than it is now,\u201d Lockett admitted.\n\nBut it\u2019s not. They\u2019re winning because Wilson won\u2019t let them lose.\n\nAnd if it continues, the Seahawks could be an anomaly in a league that often requires teams to pay extraordinary money to a quarterback just so they can be ordinary.\n\n\u201cWrite it down: The Seahawks are back,\u201d Britt said, before repeating a favorite Wilson line. \u201cWhy not us? With Russell, we have that unwavering confidence.\u201d", "description": "As top-paid NFL quarterbacks try to maintain their levels, Seattle\u2019s is playing the best football of his career.", "authors": ["Jerry Brewer", "Sports Columnist", "October At Am", "Jerry Brewer Is A Sports Columnist At The Washington Post.
