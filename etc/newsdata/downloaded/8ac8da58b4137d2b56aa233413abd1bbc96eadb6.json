Currently still predicted to hit Suzuka on Saturday it will bring winds of between 100 and 140mph and exceptionally heavy rain. Drivers were unequivocal that they could not take to the track under such conditions but confident that the right decision would be made on whether to hold qualifying.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s pretty clear if the typhoon is going to come here there\u2019s no way we can drive,\u201d said Ferrari\u2019s Charles Leclerc. \u201cBut off my previous experience \u2013 and I\u2019ve only done one year and a half in F1 \u2013 they\u2019ve always been quite safe with the conditions\u201d\n\nThe director of the Grand Prix Drivers Association, Romain Grosjean, echoed his opinion. \u201cThere\u2019s supposed to be gusts of wind at 120kmh on Saturday and if that is the case, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s safe to be on track or in the grandstands or anywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any point in discussing it. I believe they are going to take the best decision.\u201d\n\nSafety will be of paramount importance. Five years ago at this race the accident which ultimately led to Jules Bianchi\u2019s death occurred during very wet conditions inflicted by Typhoon Phanfone. Qualifying has been postponed until Sunday morning twice here before in 2004 and 2010. Contingency plans are already in place to do so again, in which Hamilton was confident.\n\nSign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n\n\u201cThey are doing the utmost they can,\u201d he said. \u201cI am sure they are preparing, are aware that it is coming, and have procedures in place. It is cool when the format changes. You have to enter into two different mindsets, and two different rhythms. It is a different challenge so I like that.\u201d\n\nThe FIA and F1 are hopeful however that the storm may yet not make an impact on Suzuka. They are holding meetings with the circuit and local authorities and will await developments before changing the weekend\u2019s timetable. Their stance is backed by Sebastian Vettel: \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody wants to put lives in danger. There is a forecast, but how many times has a forecast changed?\u201d he said. \u201cWe will see what happens as the weekend goes on. It makes sense that when we have more evidence tomorrow night to put together a proposal or an action for qualifying then.\u201d", "description": "Formula One drivers believe qualifying for the Japanese Grand Prix cannot take place on Saturday if the Suzuka circuit is hit by Typhoon Hagibis", "authors": ["Giles Richards"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f9efff8170c3d750f1321314cb027bf8f8743ff/0_140_4794_2876/master/4794.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d77b610ff1ffeaf87e9ef4fbb59e67eb", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
