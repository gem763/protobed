According to the Met Office, there will be a ridge of high pressure across the UK on Monday evening, producing dry weather and clear skies for most.\n\nClear skies will give most of us a good chance to spot the shooting stars (AFP)\n\nWhile some in the far north west and far south east of the country may have some clouds to contend with, most will get a good view.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe phenomenon gets its name from the Orion constellation \u2013 which is one of the brightest groups of stars in the sky.\n\nAnna Ross, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, told the PA news agency: \u2018Meteors will be visible all over the sky but they will appear to originate from close to the star Betelgeuse in the constellation of Orion, which will be in the east of the sky during that peak time.\u2019\n\nMeteoroids from Halley\u2019s Comet strike the Earth\u2019s atmosphere at a speed of 148,000mph, burning up in streaking flashes of light. The result is a dazzling galactic spectacle that many won\u2019t want to miss.\n\nMs Ross told PA: \u2018As both the Earth and Halley\u2019s comet have elliptical orbits around the Sun, these two intersect twice per year. This causes not only the Orionids, but also the Eta Aquarids meteor shower in May.\u2019\n\nThe Orionids will be visible until November 7 (PA)\n\nThe Orionids will be visible in both northern and southern hemispheres until November 7.\n\nMs Ross said: \u2018For the best chances to spot the Orionids, find a dark area of clear sky and allow around 20 minutes to let your eyes adapt to the dark.\u2019\n\n\u2018It may also be advisable to lie down as you will be looking up for a long time.\u2019", "description": "You can expect up to 25 shooting stars per hour", "authors": ["Jeff Parsons"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/gettyimages-1016873386_1571640998.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
