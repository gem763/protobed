My mom cannot lay and watch TV without one and neither can I. This has translated to owning way too many throw blankets to snuggle under no matter the weather. If there\u2019s one home accessory I can\u2019t get enough of, it\u2019s a throw blanket. It\u2019s even a running joke with my boyfriend\u2019s family that when they get on their Sunday FaceTime session, I\u2019m going to be under a blanket on the couch. They\u2019re right 9 out of 10 times. If you have a throw blanket addiction you want to feed, might we suggest some of these top-rated covers?\n\nChunky Knit Throw Blanket, $30 at Target: Just one look at this blanket and you can see why it\u2019s a best-seller with great reviews. The sweater-knit blanket is hefty but not stuffy. It\u2019s made from a lightweight, breathable acrylic so you can wear it all year.\n\nLOMAO Sherpa Fleece Blanket, $33 on Amazon: Most sherpa blankets are single-color and a bit dull. This patterned one from Amazon not only has a crazy-high 4.9-star rating on over 300 reviews, but it also comes in a handful of bold colors with a starburst pattern that\u2019s chic, not boring. It\u2019s the grown-up version of a fuzzy blanket.\n\nLight Grey Faux Fur Throw, $129 at CB2: There\u2019s always something luxurious about faux fur. This soft blanket is big enough to fit two people under and will be the only thing you\u2019ll want to wrap yourself in when the temperature drops. The faux fur is double-sided, so you get two-times the plushness. Plus, it looks pretty badass draped over the side of the couch.\n\nWindowpane Alpaca Throw, $249 at Parachute: Some people are Merino people and some people are alpaca people. I am the latter. This throw from Parachute has all the makings of becoming the perfect blanket. The bold, black-and-white windowpane plaid is subtle but enough to make a statement, even against a patterned couch or chair.\n\nScouted is internet shopping with a pulse.
