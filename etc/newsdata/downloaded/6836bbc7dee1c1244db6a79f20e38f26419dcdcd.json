Mattel\n\nThere are six different dolls in the collection, all of which have different skin tones.\n\nEach doll comes with two hairstyle options and various outfits.\n\nUnlike Mattel's best-known doll, the iconic Barbie, the Creatable World dolls do not have overly (and often unrealistically) feminized facial features or figures.\n\nThere are no Bambi-esque lashes or tiny waists, and equally there aren't particularly muscular shoulders or defined jawlines.\n\nMattel\n\n\"Toys are a reflection of culture and as the world continues to celebrate the positive impact of inclusivity, we felt it was time to create a doll line free of labels,\" Kim Culmone, Senior Vice President of Mattel Fashion Doll Design said in a statement sent to Insider.\n\n\"Through research, we heard that kids don't want their toys dictated by gender norms. This line allows all kids to express themselves freely which is why it resonates so strongly with them.\n\n\"We're hopeful Creatable World will encourage people to think more broadly about how all kids can benefit from doll play.\"\n\nRead more: 11 hilariously bad dolls that look nothing like the celebrities they're modeled after\n\nThe new line comes following a changing culture in recent years that has seen parents complaining about gender-segregated toy aisles, gender stereotyped products, and sexist clothing for children.\n\nUK organisation Let Toys Be Toys frequently calls out potentially damaging toys and campaigns aimed at children.\n\nCommenting on the new Creatable World dolls, Let Toys Be Toys campaigner Megan Perryman points out that the dolls are likely to appeal to children because they'll be able to create one that resembles themselves.\n\n\"We know that boys and girls are more alike than they are different, but it takes an inclusively-marketed toy like this to make that really apparent,\" she wrote in a blog for the company.\n\n\"This move by Mattel should not be underestimated,\" she added.\n\n\"As a major player in the toy industry this signals something that parents have known for a while \u2014 many children love dolls. They just need to know they are allowed to.\"\n\nMattel\n\nThe dolls will be available across the globe \u2014 US consumers can purchase one from Amazon for $29.99, and UK shoppers can pick up a doll for \u00a334.99 from Amazon, Smyths, Argos, and Very.\n\nThis isn't the first move by Mattel to create more inclusive and realistic doll options, though \u2014 in 2016, it launched Barbie dolls with three new body shapes: tall, petite, and curvy.\n\nThey also had new face shapes, eye colors, and skin tones.\n\nIn March 2019, the company released its most diverse range of Barbies to date, the Fashionista line.\n\nCelebrating both the brand's 60th birthday and International Women's Day, each new Barbie was designed to look like a particular remarkable woman, such as tennis player Naomi Osaka, model Adwoa Aboah, and actress Yara Shahidi, Insider's Ellen Cranley reported.\n\nIn June this year, Mattel was also widely praised after launching a black, disabled Barbie in a wheelchair.\n\nRead more:\n\nMattel is releasing glamorous 'Star Wars' Barbie dolls for $100 that every collector will want\n\nHere's what Barbie looked like the year you were born\n\nWe compared our bodies to Barbie.
