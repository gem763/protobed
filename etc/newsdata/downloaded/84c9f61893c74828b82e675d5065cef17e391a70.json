Hardshells are very versatile as they\u2019ll be waterproof, windproof and breathable \u2013 therefore ideal for ski touring and warmer days \u2013 yet by layering with a fleece or thermals you\u2019ll be set for cold days or resort skiing. Insulated jackets on the other hand are ideal for resort and on piste skiing, or for all types of skiing in the colder months \u2013 if you\u2019re touring or going at Easter, you won\u2019t want this.\n\nWaterproofness is of course key. It\u2019s worth knowing that waterproof garments are often tested against a universal performance scale and rated from 0-50,000mm+. The lowest you\u2019d really want is 10,000mm, with high end performance gear up at 20-30,000mm (being highly waterproof yet still flexible and breathable).\n\nAlso, more premium options might feature a concealed Recco reflector. This is a neat plaster sized passive reflector meaning you can be detected by an avalanche transceiver in that worst case scenario.\n\nWe have selected a range of jackets suitable for all conditions and types of skiing, and tested them in terms of their fit, comfort, build and materials quality, and importantly their performance in adverse weather.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

Made from a two-layer Gore-Tex fabric it\u2019s highly waterproof (min. 20,000mm), durable, and the synthetic insulation (50 per cent recycled) is thicker in the body than the arms, but with generous pit vents you can cool you down if you get hot (there\u2019s always Norrona\u2019s brilliant uninsulated version if that suits you better). The stretchy snowskirt (nb not non-removable) will help keep snow out, as will the elasticated hand gaiters and generous big helmet compatible hood. The arm length, body length and general cut is ideal (not too baggy / tight), the fleece lined hand warming pockets are a nice luxurious touch (plus there\u2019s three other external and two internal). This is the essence of the ski jacket and will have you totally set for a first-to-last lift day on the slopes.\n\nBuy now\n\nPicture Organic harvest jacket: \u00a3389.90, Picture organic\n\nIf sustainability and the environment are a priority to you, Picture is all about this, while still turning out very capable products indeed. The brand has nailed aesthetics with this jacket \u2013 it\u2019s great looking \u2013 and importantly it\u2019s feels great and is really comfortable. It\u2019s well cut and proportioned (not too long) with enough bagginess for layering and free movement whilst not making you feeling swamped. It uses a three layer highly waterproof (20,000mm) and breathable bio-based fabric which uses a renewable castor oil, as well as more earth friendly water repellent treatment to provide its waterproofness. All seams are fully taped, all zips are fully waterproof YKK and there\u2019s a great pocket configuration (four on the front exterior, non on the inside) with two zippered pit vents to keep you cool.

Immediately noticeable is it\u2019s generously sized \u2013 the arms are quite long and baggy \u2013 if you\u2019re skinny you could find it too bulky (drop down a size?), but then again it makes the jacket more versatile, ideal to generously layer underneath, plus it will never restrict your movement. Length wise in the body, coming to just below your crotch it is long, so it\u2019s ideal for backcountry skiing. Made of a super durable three layer Gore Tex with soft flannel backer plus taped seams, it\u2019s a highly waterproof jacket with snow skirt and velcro wrist tabs (nb, there\u2019s no wrist gaiters).

All importantly too, it\u2019s highly waterproof (20,000m) with taped seams, so both the synthetic insulation and you will stay dry in all but the wettest conditions. Utilising two types of fabric \u2013 a stretchy one around the lower parts (torso and arms) with more hard wearing one around the upper shoulders for durability \u2013 it\u2019s super comfortable plus it\u2019s a great length in the arms, body and fit around the waist (nb with toggles to for adjustment).

It\u2019s a highly breathable and durable more minimal shell distilling those elements you\u2019ll need and discards those it deems you won\u2019t. For instance, it has no snowskirt or hand gaiters, but with a three layer Gore-Tex nylon combined with super stretchy Gore-Tex panels around the back of the shoulder blades and pits, it affords a great range of movement and is comfortable. It would also even double up perfectly as a general outdoors waterproof shell or around town too because its sizing isn\u2019t excessive \u2013 it\u2019s more trim and just feels right and nicely roomy without too much space for cold air to find. There\u2019s a generous vent on either side from the hem up to the pit \u2013 it\u2019s very well suited to ski touring \u2013 and in keeping with the minimal vibe the backs of all the pockets inside the jacket are mesh.\n\nBuy now\n\nJack Wolfskin powder mountain: \u00a3260, Jack Wolfskin\u200b\n\nA great all rounder for on piste skiing, its two layer outer shell is really waterproof (20,000mm) and breathable, plus with a nice level of insulation, it\u2019s ideal for colds day on the slope.

With one internal phone pocket three external pockets, Recco reflector and arm pit vents, at the price this is ideal for resort skiers.\n\nBuy now\n\nPatagonia snowdrifter jacket: \u00a3360, Patagonia\n\nMade from 70 per cent post-consumer (eg bottles, mattresses, clothing) recycled polyester, this is a top choice for the environmentally conscious.

The fit is certainly on the generous side and, coming to below crotch level, it\u2019s the longest cut of any in this line up, and the arms are long too. It\u2019s fitted with a stretch drawcord snowskirt (nb, not removable), Recco reflector, and \u2013 as is the case with many more snowboard style jackets \u2013 completes most of the features on this more minimal jacket.\n\nBuy now\n\nSalewa sesvenna active Gore-Tex jacket: \u00a3360, Salewa\n\nSalewa is a lesser known brand in the UK, however founded in 1935, this Italian Dolomites based brand has a rich heritage and is very popular on the continent, reputed for turning out functional and technical mountaineering kit.

At just 312g, it\u2019s lightweight, extremely waterproof (28,000mm) and highly breathable. The fit is on the slimmer side of things and there\u2019s less features \u2013 just two outside pockets, no vents and no snowskirt \u2013 but it\u2019s still very well suited to the purist.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Men\u2019s ski and snowboard jackets 2019/2020\n\nThe best all rounder jacket is the Norrona Lofoten insulated jacket: lightly insulated to take the edge of colder days, yet good vents still mean it\u2019d cross over to some touring too. Very well cut, great attention to detail, and little luxuries like the fleece lined pockets add up to make this our top pick.\n\nBut if you\u2019re solely an in resort skier, the Eider camber jacket is a fantastic jacket \u2013 well built, very well insulated and great fitting.\n\nIf ski touring or backcountry skiing is more your thing, the Picture harvest jacket is a great option, and the Arc\u2019Teryx sabre AR jacket is good if you like more generously sized gear.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
