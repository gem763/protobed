This combination of images provided by NASA shows a series of photographs made by the New Horizons spacecraft as it approached the Kuiper belt object Ultima Thule on January 1\n\nThe high-resolution photos which were Scientists say the two lobes of Ultima Thule came together in a 'gentle' accretion process, with two objects bound together by each other's gravity.\n\nThe latest movie of Ultima was put together from photos taken New Year's Eve and New Year's Day as the spacecraft made its closest approach, but not sent back to Earth until the last few days.\n\nUltima Thule rotates about every 16 hours so the time-lapsed movie shows seven of those hours.\n\nScientists from NASA's New Horizons mission released the first stitched together animation of Ultima Thule (TOO-lee), the most distant object ever explored by humans.
