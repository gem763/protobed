One person was arrested and one person was detained by sheriff's deputies early Friday.\n\nThe \"Storm Area 51\" invitation spawned festivals in the tiny Nevada towns of Rachel and Hiko nearest the military site, and a more than two-hour drive from Las Vegas. Lincoln County Sheriff Kerry Lee estimated late Thursday that about 1,500 people had gathered at the festival sites and said more than 150 people also made the rugged trip several additional miles on bone-rattling dirt roads to get within selfie distance of the gates.\n\nAuthorities say one person was arrested on a charge of public urination and another was detained early Friday at a gate to Area 51 on Friday. Lee scheduled a media briefing later Friday.\n\nAlien-hunters gather to \"storm\" Area 51 at an entrance to the military facility near Rachel, Nevada on September 20, 2019.

Before it was taken down, 2 million people had said they were interested in attending the event \u2014 and Roberts didn't want to let them down.\n\nThe military responded with stern warnings that lethal force could be used if people entered the Nevada Test and Training Range, and local and state officials said arrests would be made if people tried.\n\n\"It's public land,\" the sheriff said. \"They're allowed to go to the gate, as long as they don't cross the boundary.\"\n\nA music group called Wily Savage erected a stage Thursday near the Little A'Le'Inn in Rachel and began playing after dark for several hundred campers who braved overnight temperatures about 45 degrees.\n\nDaniel Martinez, 31, a Pokemon collectible cards dealer from Pomona, California, was among the first to whirl and dance at the dusty makeshift festival grounds - warm beneath a wolf \"spirit hood\" and matching faux fur jacket.\n\n\"Here's a big open space for people to be,\" he said. \"One person starts something and it infects everybody with positivity. Anything can happen if you give people a place to be.\"\n\nThe entertainment kicked off weekend events that also feature a gathering Friday and Saturday at the Alien Research Center souvenir store in Hiko.\n\nA mans holds an inflatable alien at an entrance to the Nevada Test and Training Range near Area 51 Friday, Sept. 20, 2019, near Rachel, Nev. People gathered at the gate inspired by the \"Storm Area 51\" internet hoax. John Locher / AP\n\nOwner George Harris said it would focus on music, movies and talks about extraterrestrial lore.\n\nAuthorities reported no serious incidents related to festivals scheduled until Sunday. Hiko and Rachel are about a 45-minute drive apart on a state road dubbed the Extraterrestrial Highway, and a two-hour drive from Las Vegas.\n\nEarlier, as Wily Savage band members helped erect the wooden frame for a stage, guitarist Alon Burton said he saw a chance to perform for people looking for a scene in which to be seen.\n\n\"It started as a joke, but it's not a joke for us,\" he said. \"We know people will come out. We just don't know how many.\"\n\nMichael Ian Borer, a University of Nevada, Las Vegas, sociologist who researches pop culture and paranormal activity, called the festivities sparked by the internet joke \"a perfect blend of interest in aliens and the supernatural, government conspiracies, and the desire to know what we don't know.\"\n\nThe result, Borer said, was \"hope and fear\" for events that include the \"Area 51 Basecamp\" featuring music, speakers and movies in Hiko, and festivals in Rachel and Las Vegas competing for the name \"Alienstock.\"\n\n\"People desire to be part of something, to be ahead of the curve,\" Borer said. \"Area 51 is a place where normal, ordinary citizens can't go. When you tell people they can't do something, they just want to do it more.\"\n\nEric Holt, the Lincoln County emergency manager, said he believed authorities could handle 30,000 visitors at the two events. Still, neighbors braced for trouble after millions of people responded to the \"Storm Area 51\" Facebook post weeks ago.\n\n\"Those that know what to expect camping in the desert are going to have a good time,\" said Joerg Arnu, a Rachel resident who can see the festival grounds from his home. \"Those who show up in shorts and flip-flops will find no protection against \"critters, snakes and scorpions.\"\n\n\"It will get cold at night. They're not going to find what they're looking for, and they are going to get angry,\" Arnu said.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration closed nearby airspace, although Air Force jets could be heard in the sun-drenched skies, along with an occasional sonic boom.", "description": "Call to \"storm\" the secretive U.S. military base in the Nevada desert known as Area 51 attracted several dozen revelers to entrance", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/20/04c45d1f-bf0c-4486-989c-4b72423bd730/thumbnail/1200x630/ece04397836df5c19d16e8280f224170/area-51-gettyimages-1169830898.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
