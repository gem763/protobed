Talks have been mired in disagreements around how to regulate e-commerce and labor migration, among other issues.\n\nNow, under the weight of trade-war pressures, regional trade spats and a global economic slowdown, that deadline is looking less realistic.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not done in November, you don\u2019t get an RCEP,\u201d Deborah Elms, executive director of the Asian Trade Centre, a Singapore-based think tank, said in an interview Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to take on liberalization moves in a recession.\u201d\n\nNegotiators already had resigned themselves to making little progress this year as a spate of elections -- including in India, Indonesia and Thailand -- interrupted progress. Elms sees fewer catalysts for a deal, and even more obstacles, in 2020.\n\nSome economies in the region are already seeing early signs of recession. Next year, you\u2019ll have \u201ceconomies going south and supply chains getting ruptured,\u201d said Elms, who has participated in almost all of the 27 rounds of RCEP negotiations.", "description": "Dreams of an Asia-Pacific Trade Pact by Year-End Fading Again", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic3ef9ce734b5a3c5b49a23c4c18b37304.jpg"}
