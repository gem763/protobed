Revenue fell 23% to $14.7 billion.\n\nAnalysts polled by FactSet had expected net profit of $1.06 billion on revenue of $16.04 billion.\n\nAdjusted earnings fell 46% to $2.59 billion against expectations of $2.68 billion.\n\nThe company, which is 67%-owned by the Norwegian state, proposed a maintained dividend of 26 cents for the third quarter.\n\nEquinor said its earnings were weighed by lower average prices and lower volumes for both liquids and gas, in addition to impairment losses, mainly related to unconventional onshore assets in North America.\n\nIt posted net impairments of $2.79 billion, provisions of $560 million and changes in fair value of derivatives and inventory hedge contracts of $444 million, with a positive gain from sale of assets of $849 million.\n\nProvisions and impairments were related to damage at its South Riding Point oil terminal in the Bahamas, in addition to onerous contract provisions in North America, it said.\n\nEquinor delivered total equity production of 1.909 million barrels of oil equivalent a day in the third quarter, down from 2.066 million barrels a day in 2018.\n\nThe company still expects exploration spending of around $1.7 billion and production around the 2018 level.\n\nFor the 2019 to 2025 period, production growth is still expected from new projects, resulting in a compound annual growth rate of around 3%.\n\nWrite to Dominic Chopping at dominic.chopping@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 24, 2019 01:55 ET (05:55 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
