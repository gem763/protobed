I'm sorry, I'm not going to put myself in a position for you to weaponize my answer.\"\n\nBut she insisted the prime minister \"never, ever gave me favoritism.\"\n\n\"Categorically Boris had nothing to do with my achievements in London,\" she said.\n\nArcuri also claimed she had made up the existence of a letter written by Johnson recommending her for the \u00a3100,000-a-year job as chief executive of tech quango Tech City.\n\nIn a lengthy first broadcast interview since multiple allegations of impropriety surfaced in the Sunday Times, Arcuri revealed she had saved Johnson's number on her phone as \u201cAlex the Great,\u201d and that they bonded over their \u201cmutual love of classic literature.\u201d\n\n\u201cI care about him deeply as a friend. We shared a very close bond,\" she said.\n\nArcuri joked she had asked Johnson to have a go on a pole-dancing pole in her home office, which she said Johnson had visited \"a handful\" of times, but wouldn't reveal whether he took her up on the offer, saying: \"I'm never going to tell you that.\"\n\nPressed on when she had last spoken with or texted the now-PM, she said, \"I stopped speaking to Boris regularly when I got pregnant at the end of 2016,\" and added she had \"absolutely not\" had contact with him since the allegations about their relationship emerged.\n\nAsked whether she had ever loved Johnson, Arcuri said: \"I've been asked that many times, and I care about him deeply,\" adding: \"I wish Carrie well,\" referring to the prime minister's girlfriend Carrie Symonds.", "description": "PM is facing several inquiries over claims he broke a code of conduct by not declaring a relationship with Arcuri.", "authors": ["Annabelle Dickson", "Zoya Sheftalovich"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1178137098-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
