However not all of those votes have been verified.\n\nAfter a recent visit to the IEC, Canada\u2019s ambassador to Afghanistan Dave Metcalfe said he was \u201cimpressed\u201d by the commission\u2019s attempts to fight voter fraud.\n\n\u201cThe checks and balances implemented by the IEC represent a new standard for Afghan elections,\u201d he said in a statement.", "description": "Kabul (AFP) \u2013 Afghanistan\u2019s election commission is orchestrating \u201csystematic fraud\u201d following presidential polls last month, a top", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/12/b354fe_afghan-presidential-candidate-abdullah-abdullah-claimed-victory-two-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
