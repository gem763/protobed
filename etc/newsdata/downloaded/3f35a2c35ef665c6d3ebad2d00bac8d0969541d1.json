Or Chair Airlines, a Swiss airline that flies throughout Europe and is not a figment of your imagination. There\u2019s even OK Airways, which provides flights to China and Thailand, and hey, at least they\u2019re honest about their quality of service.\n\nBut is it worth booking through an airline you know nothing about? Well, that depends, particularly on your budget, necessity for comfort and travel plans. Before you decide to book through unfamiliar airlines, below are several things to keep in mind; just make sure to confirm your reservation\u2019s airports and read the small print.\n\nCheck for fees and partnered airlines\n\nFirst, before you book, always check for fees that may not be included in your reservation\u2014think fees for checked bags, carry-ons or just to reserve a seat. Allegiant Airlines, a low-cost airline that operates throughout the U.S, will charge you just to print a boarding pass at the airport. (It\u2019s true and it costs about $7.)\n\nIn the end, your ticket might seem like a deal, but probably less so when an airline tacks on fees you aren\u2019t initially made aware of. In this instance, the best course of action is to do an online search for that airline and \u201cservice optional fees\u201d or more generally \u201cfees.\u201d If you have any doubts or the airline\u2019s website leads you astray, contact an airline representative instead and ask them about bag or seat reservation fees.\n\nAfterward, do an online search for that airline to see if it\u2019s partnered with a major airline; if you have points through an airline, you may be able to use those to purchase a flight. American Airlines, for instance, is partnered with a bunch of smaller airlines, including Air Tahiti Nui, Etihad Airways and InterJet.\n\nConfirm the airports and check for reviews\n\nIf you\u2019re flying a small, commuter airline, it\u2019s possible your proposed itinerary\u2019s airports aren\u2019t major hubs. As CNBC Make It recommends, always, always make sure to double-check both airports before confirming your reservation. You don\u2019t want to end up an hour outside of your destination because you weren\u2019t sure where the airport was based\u2014better yet, map out your hotel from the airport, just to be sure. (And if you need a rental car, make sure that airport offers that availability. At the very least, make sure you can get a ride from the airport to a car rental agency.)\n\nAnd, it goes without saying, but checking reviews of the airline is pretty critical. You can use websites like airlinequality.com to find reviews for just about every airline. Here\u2019s one review of a flight through OK Airlines: \u201cSeats bit cramped, I had to stretch my legs in the aisle ... No screens of any kind just magazines in the seat pocket acceptable for a regional flight, but that does not mean that there should be chewing gum gluing the pages together! Nothing to eat or drink, no bottled water no bags of nuts. The only flight attendant was invisible throughout the flight.\u201d If several reviews like this scare you off, maybe you should take a moment to consider your other options.\n\nTripAdvisor also crowdsources reviews for airlines to help you avoid an especially terrible flight. \u201cThe whole plane is dirty but wait until you see the toilets,\u201d writes MartaKent in a review of Air Mediterranean. \u201c... At some point, I even saw the cabin crew pouring hot water in one of the loo trying to unblock it. (Are you even supposed to pour hot water in a plane\u2019s toilet?)\u201d Good question!\n\nAnd lastly, before you book, make sure you know the airline\u2019s refund policy in the event your trip doesn\u2019t go off as planned. Generally, U.S. airlines stick by the 24-hour rule and allow you up to a day to cancel without incurring costs. Elsewhere, it\u2019s entirely up to them as to how or whether they\u2019ll refund you if you decide to change or cancel your plans altogether. For these reasons, always look at the small print before booking, and if you have any doubts, again, contact the airline directly or find reviews of other travellers who may have dealt with customer support nightmares with that airline.", "description": "In your quest to find an especially great deal for a flight, you\u2019ll likely come across airlines that seem made up\u2014take Bearskin Airlines, for example, which operates out of Ontario, Canada and is very real.
