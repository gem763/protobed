BTC could rise steadily as long as there is no close below the $10,000 support area.\n\nBitcoin Price Weekly Analysis (BTC)\n\nIn the last weekly forecast, we saw bitcoin price holding the key $10,000 support area against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair climbed higher and traded above the $10,000 resistance area. Moreover, there was a break above the $10,800 level and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours). However, the price failed to continue higher and topped below the $11,000 resistance.\n\nA swing high was formed near $10,954 and recently the price started a fresh decline. It broke the key $10,500 support area and the 100 SMA. Moreover, the price spiked below the $10,000 support area. Finally, a swing low was formed near $9,903 and the price is currently correcting higher. It broke the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $10,954 high to $9,903 low.\n\nHowever, the upward move is facing hurdles near the $10,400 and $10,500 levels. Additionally, the price is also struggling to climb above the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $10,954 high to $9,903 low. If there is a break above the $10,450 and $10,500 levels, the price could continue to rise. The next key resistance is near the $10,800 level.\n\nOn the downside, there are many supports near the $10,100 and $10,000 levels. Additionally, there is a major bullish trend line forming with support near $10,140 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair. If there is a downside break below the trend line and the $10,000 support, the price could resume its decline.\n\nLooking at the chart, bitcoin price seems to be consolidating in a contracting range below the $10,500 resistance. It might soon break the $10,500 resistance and continue higher. Conversely, a downside break below $10,000 could start a strong decline in the coming sessions.\n\nTechnical indicators\n\n4 hours MACD \u2013 The MACD for BTC/USD is slowly moving back into the bullish zone.\n\n4 hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) \u2013 The RSI for BTC/USD is currently stable above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $10,000\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $10,500", "description": "Bitcoin price is showing positive signs above $10,000 against the US Dollar.
