To me, home means conversation. It's the place where my family comes together, and that's the most beautiful part of home. But there are over 100 million people in the world that don't have a place to call home.'\n\nDoing their part: Will Smith, Chris Martin, and Helen Mirren are encouraging people to help fight homelessness by taking part in The World's Big Sleep Out\n\nAlongside Will, Helen has also joined the cause, as she appeared in the video to encourage people to take part in the event, which will be taking place on December 7.\n\nShe said: 'On December 7 2019, we are hoping for 50,000 people to sleep out in the world's largest display of solidarity and support for homeless and displaced people. Major sleep out events will be happening in Trafalgar Square, in Times Square, and in 50 cities across the world.'\n\nThe World's Big Sleep Out is hoping to raise a whopping $50 million for the cause, and people can even take part just by sleeping outside in their garden.\n\nJosh Littlejohn, the campaign founder, said: 'We're asking you to come and join us, whether you're sleeping out at an official event, or you're hosting your own \"Sleep Out\" in your back garden.\n\nDoing his part: Chris Martin was among the big names taking part in the campaign\n\nHelping out: Helen Mirren urged viewers to participate in the big sleep out\n\nGlobal event: The sleep-out is set to take place December 7 in cities around the world\n\nShow of support: Participants will unite to show their solidarity with those suffering from homelessness\n\n'For one night, let's walk in the shoes of people that we would normally walk past, and let's try and raise $50 million to make a difference to people in your area and all around the world.'\n\nAnd the video was closed by Coldplay frontman Chris. He said: 'Thank you for choosing to sleep out this one night, and helping out so many people who don't have a choice.'\n\nThe World's Big Sleep Out will take place December 7, 2019 in major cities including New York, London, Los Angeles, Edinburgh, Chicago, Madrid, and Hong Kong.\n\nThe goal of the event is to raise $50,000,000 in order to help charities assisting people struggling with homelessness.\n\nFifty percent of funds raised will be given to charities assisting homelessness in their local towns.
