Without Transit, SeaLink is exposed to the domestic and inbound tourism markets, and has approximately two-thirds of revenue generated from tourism activities.\n\n\"Post-acquisition, the company is more diverse and less reliant on tourism, which is a volatile sector,\" he says. \"The more stable earnings stream should attract a higher earnings multiple from the market and this has already started to happen with the strong run in the share price post-deal.\"\n\nPerennial Value's Andrew Smith says that after the acquisition, SeaLink will be a more diversified company and less reliant on tourism. James Brickwood\n\nHe also notes that the larger shareholder base means SeaLink is likely to enter the S &P/ASX300, and potentially the S &P/ASX 200, next March, providing a potential boost to the share price.\n\nAnd what about the bear case? In a nutshell, it's this: SeaLink is in effect a roll-up, with weakening earnings. This latest transaction puts two companies with similar headwinds together and doesn't address the core problem: the business is reliant on contract renewals and vulnerable to margin erosion.\n\nIt's not a death-knell call, more a buyer-beware of the slowing earnings.\n\n\"This movie has happened many times before. Over-earn. Get bashed, outperform, bar gets moved. Pass the parcel,\" says one fund manager.\n\nWhat he's effectively saying is this: many government contracts are structured in a way that if they are run more efficiently, the operator gets to keep the upside. In other words, they can over-earn for a period.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut when it comes to contract renewal, the government will re-examine the cost base, and restructure the contract accordingly. That means the company won't deliver the same margins if the contract is restructured.\n\nSeaLink doesn't always reveal details of its contracts, as it demonstrated this month when it noted that Transit contracts to operate Perth's Claremont and Marmion bus services had been re-awarded for 10 years from 2020; as well as the awarding of a new 10-year contract for Perth's Joondalup bus services.\n\nBut it is interesting to consider just how many contracts are shortly up for renewal.\n\nIn the independent experts' report, Grant Thornton noted that contracts accounting for 56 per cent of Transit's revenues were up for renewal in the next two years, and those for about 33 per cent of revenues were up for renewal before June 2020.\n\nBut the report also noted the risk was \"materially mitigated\" by Transit renewing 85 per cent of the contracts.\n\nAbout $3.5 billion per annum of bus tender opportunities were being identified by management by 2025, the report said. For the more risk-averse, particularly those who are aware of how fiddly and variable contracts can be, that's a big trust-us.\n\nPerennial's Smith says contract risk is actually reduced with this latest transaction because the Adelaide to Kangaroo Island contract is now diluted. \"Yes, there are now more contracts in the group (and therefore more contract risk) but this risk is better diversified,\" he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeaLink has a long history of acquisitions, and this isn't the first purchase it has made in the bus sector.\n\nCritics say the success of the acquisitions has been mixed and the company has been buying businesses with better margins to offset declining earnings in other parts of the business.\n\n\"It seemed to us [before the acquisition] they were spending a lot of time of small gains but taking a lot of risk,\" says a fund manager, talking about the expansion into smaller routes such as Bruny Island and Rottnest Island.\n\nSmith says that to date, SeaLink's acquisitions have made strategic sense, barring the travel app, but he agrees that performance has been mixed. The Sydney earnings have been eroded by strong competition, and the management is responding sensibly, he says.", "description": "The operator of Sydney Harbour's Captain Cook Cruises has pleased supporters with a company-transforming acquisition, although not everyone's coming on board.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_115%2C$y_35/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e1bff81af8b39fe6559b8ecf42634b263c3d3833", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
