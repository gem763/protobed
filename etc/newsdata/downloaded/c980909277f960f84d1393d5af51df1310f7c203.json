The organization faced dozens of protesters this summer in Birmingham, Alabama, where it is constructing a new clinic, according to local news outlets.\n\nThe new Illinois facility will replace Planned Parenthood's current clinic in the same area. While the organization's Reproductive Health Services department plans to continue working with patients at the nearby St. Louis health center, it plans to expand abortion services at the new clinic, according to a press release from the organization.\n\nIn addition to offering both medication and surgical abortion services, the new clinic plans to provide family planning services, including: birth control, annual exams, cancer screenings, STI testing, and HIV prevention, including PrEP.\n\nThe St. Louis center will continue offering surgical abortions.\n\n\u201cClose to 5,000 people sought care at our Fairview Heights health center last year alone, and this new center will allow us to serve even more,\" Yamelsie Rodriguez, President and CEO of PPSLRSWMO, said in the press release.\n\nThe new facility will begin seeing patients in mid-October. Planned Parenthood told CBS News that the clinic can accommodate up to 11,000 patients a year.\n\nIllinois Right to Life, a pro-life organization, lambasted the announcement in a press release Wednesday, calling the new clinic a \"money-making venture.\"\n\n\"The construction of this new facility was a strategic business move\u2014certainly not a defense of women,\" Illinois Right to Life Executive Director Mary Kate Knor said in the release. \"Let the executives of Planned Parenthood be aware that their stronghold here is temporary. We aren\u2019t going anywhere.\"\n\nUS abortion rate is at its lowest: Restrictive laws aren't the likely cause, study says\n\nPlanned Parenthood's announcement comes as national abortion rates fell to the lowest level since the procedure became legal in 1973.\n\nAccording to a recent report from the Guttmacher Institute, the increase of state abortion restrictions in recent years does not appear to be the primary driver of declining abortion rates. Instead, much of the recent decline has occurred in states that did not adopt restrictions.\n\nAt the same time, support for legal abortion has reached its highest level in more than two decades. According to a July Washington Post-ABC News poll, 60% say abortion should be legal in most or all cases.\n\nMissouri is among six states with a single abortion provider, along with Mississippi, Kentucky, West Virginia, North Dakota and South Dakota. As of August, Missouri had lost four abortion providers since 2008 because of restrictive state laws, according to Planned Parenthood.\n\nThe St. Louis location nearly closed in June, after state officials refused to renew the facility's license to perform abortions. But a judge issued a stay just hours before the license was set to expire.\n\nThe Planned Parenthood clinic in St. Louis is the last remaining abortion clinic in the state.
