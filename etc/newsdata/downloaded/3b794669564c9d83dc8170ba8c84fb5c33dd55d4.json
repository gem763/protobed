REUTERS/Gary He\n\nSabine Lautenschlaeger, a German who had criticized the ECB\u2019s easy-money policy under Mario Draghi, said on Wednesday she would quit the central bank after finding herself \u201cin a situation in which this is the best course of action\u201d.\n\nShe was one of just a third of the 25 members of the Governing Council who had dissented with a decision to resume bond purchases as part of an easing package that also included a rate cut and a pledge to keep money cheap for a long time.\n\nLane did not mention Lautenschlaeger but he acknowledged \u201cdifferences of view\u201d among ECB policymakers on issues such as the massive purchase of government bonds - something that he found \u201cperfectly reasonable\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat is true that on individual elements of what we do there are differences of view,\u201d he told a Reuters event in New York. \u201cSome of it are structural about the role of sovereign bond purchases in monetary policy, others are technical.\u201d\n\nHe added there was \u201ca very high degree of consensus\u201d on the need to ease policy and that talk of \u201cdeep divisions\u201d was exaggerated.\n\nEarlier on Friday, Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann, who had also expressed his opposition to the new bond purchases on Sept 12, said that he found the rate cut appropriate.\n\nSTRONG DEMAND\n\nLane also defended two elements of the package that have raised eyebrows on the market: the tiered system of interest rates and a new series of cheap multi-year loans to banks known as Targeted Long-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO).\n\nThe first TLTRO auction received few bids, a disappointment for the ECB that had portrayed the facility as a powerful tool to keep credit flowing to the economy.\n\nBut Lane had not given up hope.\n\n\u201cWe expect a significant TLTRO take up over time,\u201d he said.\n\nThis would also be crucial to offset some tightening in inter-bank rates, particularly in Italy, since the ECB announced it would tier its deposit rate, currently set at -0.5%, from Oct. 30.\n\nThe tiering system will exempt banks from paying the ECB a charge on their idle cash on a portion of their excess reserves.\n\nEuropean Central Bank Chief Economist Philip Lane speaks during a Reuters Newsmaker event in New York, U.S., September 27, 2019. REUTERS/Gary He\n\nThis had fueled expectations that banks will trade their reserves to profit from the tiered system, effectively reducing the amount of cash available on the money markets.\n\nLane took note of this \u201cminor issue\u201d but did not expect this to jeopardize the pass-through of the ECB\u2019s policy stance.\n\n\u201cIn the grand scheme of things this is a minor issue,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is complete pass-through.\u201d", "description": "The European Central Bank's chief economist Philip Lane played down divisions at the institution on Friday after the shock resignation of a fellow board member earlier in the week in contrast with the ECB's ultra-aggressive stimulus policy.", "authors": ["Howard Schneider", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434595021&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q1CZ", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
