The rule change would remove an estimated 3 million people from SNAP, including more than 500,000 children who were also automatically enrolled in free school-lunch programs.\n\nThe comment period for the rule change closed on Monday, and if it takes effect, school children will be affected next year. In a letter Monday, Democrats on the House Committee on Education and Labor asked Agriculture Department Secretary Sonny Perdue to withdraw the proposed rule, in part because the department failed to make its school lunch estimate public. A spokeswoman for Republicans on the committee said Democrats\u2019 concerns were unwarranted, since most students who could be removed due to the rule change will still qualify for free lunches under other criteria.\n\nLike what you're reading?
