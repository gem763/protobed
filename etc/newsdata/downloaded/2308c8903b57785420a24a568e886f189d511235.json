(CIA via AP)\n\nHamza bin Laden, the son of Osama bin Laden whom some considered the possible heir to the al-Qaeda terrorist network, was killed in a U.S. counterterrorism operation in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, President Trump said Saturday \u2014 an announcement that comes more than a month after officials suggested he was killed.\n\nOsama bin Laden\u2019s son was \u201cresponsible for planning and dealing with various terrorist groups,\u201d Trump said in a statement released by the White House. His death is a blow to al-Qaeda\u2019s leadership acumen, Trump said, and symbolic given the connection to his father, who was killed in a Navy SEAL raid on his Pakistani refuge in 2011.\n\nHamza\u2019s death could have significant influence on al-Qaeda\u2019s future. Unifying and young, and carrying the name of terrorist royalty, bin Laden lent his voice and face in messages calling for attacks worldwide. But relatively little is known about the 9/11 mastermind\u2019s youngest son \u2014 not even his formal role in al-Qaeda or his age, which is believed to be around 30.\n\nSome analysts say his role in al-Qaeda was overstated, with little evidence Hamza was particularly influential or on track to take the reins of the entire operation, said Peter Bergen, a vice president focused on international security at New America, a Washington think tank.\n\n\u201cOther than the president\u2019s statement claiming an operational role, I have never seen any evidence of [Hamza] being involved in operations besides releasing audio and video tapes calling for violence,\u201d Bergen told The Washington Post on Saturday.\n\nWhile it is clear that bin Laden was being groomed for senior leadership at a time al-Qaeda is putting a young face forward, Bergen said, \u201cthe people who led the organization for a long time are still alive,\u201d including Ayman al-Zawahiri, the 68-year old co-founder of al-Qaeda and the successor of Osama bin Laden.\n\nTrump gave no further details about the operation that killed the younger bin Laden, and it is unclear when and where he was killed. No recordings featuring Hamza bin Laden have been released for several months, and al-Qaeda has not issued a formal announcement of his death, even though it is typical for the group to do so when leaders are killed.\n\n[Yemen rebels claim responsibility for drone attack on major Saudi oil facilities]\n\nU.S. officials for months have telegraphed the possibility of his death. In July, NBC reported it obtained intelligence he was killed.\n\nBergen said his own discussions on July 31 with people close to the bin Laden family indicated Hamza was already dead by then. Trump\u2019s statement indicated he may have been killed in the tribal region of Pakistan by a drone strike similar to ones the CIA used to target other al-Qaeda leaders there, he said.\n\nHamza bin Laden was an appealing figure for a younger generation of Islamist militancy, terrorism experts have said, as al-Qaeda competes with the Islamic State for visibility and recruits.\n\nHe was \u201cbeloved\u201d by the \u201cglobal jihadi community\u201d because he \u201cstressed unity\u201d in his speeches and never criticized the Islamic State, Rita Katz, a terrorism expert with the Search International Terrorist Entities Intelligence Group, said on Twitter in July, when public reports of his death began to circulate.\n\nThough he was never given a formal title within the group, Katz wrote, his death would be a \u201cmajor blow to the movement.\u201d U.S. officials described him as an emerging al-Qaeda leader as recently as March.\n\nDespite fighting between the Islamic State and al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, Islamic State militants still view Osama bin Laden with high regard and maintained respect for his son Hamza.\n\n\u201cIf he had a different last name, he would be less important,\u201d Bergen said.\n\nDocuments recovered from the raid to kill Osama bin Laden, which included directions to aides on how to care for and educate his son, indicated plans to prepare him for senior militant leadership, though Bergen said it was unclear at what level. Hamza spent nearly a decade under house arrest in Iran, which would have stunted his growth and experience, Bergen said.\n\nThe State Department offered a $1 million reward for information about bin Laden\u2019s son, saying he released audio and video messages that called on followers to \u201claunch attacks against the United States\u201d and threatened revenge for his father\u2019s killing.\n\nThat figure may indicate a lower priority for U.S. officials than some acknowledge. His reward on the State Department\u2019s page for other terrorist leaders and suspects is the lowest listed among bounties between $3 million and $25 million.\n\nWhile Osama bin Laden favored large and intricate terrorism strikes, such as the 9/11 attacks, his son called for quick, spontaneous worldwide violence against Americans, Europeans, Jews and pro-Western Muslims using any weapon the militants could muster.\n\n\u201cIf you are able to pick a firearm, well and good; if not, the options are many,\u201d he said in a 2017 recording.\n\nAl-Qaeda itself \u201cis out of business,\u201d Bergen said, while its affiliates are focused on local conflicts, like in Afghanistan and Syria, rather than on attacks in the West. Hamza\u2019s death, then, \u201cis one more nail in its collective coffin,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Pentagon and U.S. Central Command, which oversees military operations in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, referred queries to the White House.\n\nWhile Trump hailed the killing of Hamza bin Laden as a victorious moment, a resolution in the 18-year-old conflict in Afghanistan \u2014 where al-Qaeda was harbored by the Taliban \u2014 has proved to be elusive.\n\nU.S. military activity in Afghanistan has focused on containing Taliban and Islamic State militants while peace negotiations and decisions on a U.S. troop withdrawal have sputtered along. Trump declared those peace talks \u201cdead\u201d on Monday.\n\nPamela Constable in Kabul, and Shane Harris, Missy Ryan and Dan Lamothe in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump vets candidates to replace Bolton amid GOP divisions on foreign policy\n\nU.S. imposes sanctions on North Korean hackers accused in Sony attack, dozens of other incidents", "description": "The White House confirmed Hamza bin Laden\u2019s death on Saturday, but U.S. officials for months have telegraphed the possibility of his killing at the hands of U.S. forces.", "authors": ["Alex Horton", "General Assignment Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News", "September At Pm", "Alex Horton Is A General Assignment Reporter For The Washington Post.
