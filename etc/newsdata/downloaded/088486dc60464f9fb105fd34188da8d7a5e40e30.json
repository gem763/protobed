Up to that point the deaths had not been treated as suspicious because of the timeframe.\n\nThomas, a popular member of the community in Kozhikode, was allegedly motivated by wanting control of the family finances and property, police said.\n\nAccording to police, the first poisoning was of Thomas\u2019s mother-in-law, who died in 2002 after eating mutton soup. In 2008, her-father-in-law died, followed by her husband in 2011, who police said died after eating rice and curry. An autopsy conducted on his body at the time confirmed poisonous substances in his stomach, but police treated his death as suicide.\n\nThomas\u2019s husband\u2019s uncle was then allegedly given coffee laced with cyanide as punishment for insisting that a postmortem be carried out on his nephew.\n\nIn 2014, police said Thomas killed the two-year-old daughter of her dead husband\u2019s cousin, Scaria Shaju. The cousin\u2019s wife was then killed in 2016. A year later Thomas and Shaju married.\n\nShaju told police he had no idea that Thomas was behind his wife and daughter\u2019s death but he has been arrested along with a third person.\n\nOn Friday, police exhumed remains from the local cemetery and said that they confirmed cyanide poisoning in each of the deaths. On Monday, they said Thomas confessed to all the murders.", "description": "Murders took place over 14-year period and each victim ate a meal prepared by the killer", "authors": ["Amrit Dhillon"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dd5be43ee8d58329febeb011f0d4df1c073d8e2/24_0_722_433/master/722.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cc1091e22a12f968fb11a13578e85ff3", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
