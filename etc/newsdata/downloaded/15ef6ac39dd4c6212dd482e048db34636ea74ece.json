Prosecutors have since widened their probe to include an allegation that Seungri and Yoo treated Yoon to illicit meals.Prosecutors recently arrested a former head of specialty ink maker Nokwon C&I, surnamed Jeong, who reportedly acted as a link between Yoon and Yoo, on charges of embezzlement.They are also investigating an allegation that Yoon had accepted stock worth several tens of millions of won from Jeong in 2016 in return for helping cover up corruption charges against the businessman.Meanwhile, prosecutors said they will look into whether the presidential office and other ranking police officers played a role in the previous police investigation into the Seoul nightclubs, as Yoon had worked at the Blue House from 2017 to 2018 under the supervision of Justice Minister Cho Kuk, then senior presidential secretary for civil affairs.Prosecutors are paying attention to Jeong\u2019s relations to the Cho family\u2019s private equity fund, due to its investment in Cubes, the predecessor of Nokwon C&I, in 2014.Yonhap", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
