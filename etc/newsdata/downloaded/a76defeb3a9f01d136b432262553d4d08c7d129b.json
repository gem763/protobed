The fires were extinguished by volunteer firefighters before causing any harm, according to LiveScience. Government field analysis of the scorched areas turned up no sign of meteorites, the fragmentary remains of meteors, however.\n\nAs a result, geologists from Chile\u2019s National Geology and Mining Service (Sernageomin) said meteorites weren\u2019t linked to the fires, according to a report released on Saturday. Meteorites have been falsely blamed for igniting fires on previous occasions, and scientists say it is exceedingly unlikely that these objects can cause fires unless they are relatively large.\n\nIt\u2019s still entirely possible that the fireball streaking across the Chilean skies was a meteor that simply coincided with the fires, however. Harvard University astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell tweeted that the event was \u201cprobably a meteorite\" the day after the fireball lit up the sky.\n\nBut if the fireball wasn't a meteor, regardless of whether it started the fires or not, what else could it be? If your instinct is to guess \u201cextraterrestrial spaceship,\u201d you might be right, but don\u2019t start channeling your inner Fox Mulder yet. It\u2019s vastly more likely that the fireball was caused by our own civilization\u2019s space trash than any spacefaring alien species paying a visit.\n\nThere are millions of small objects in orbit, and thousands of pieces larger than 10 centimeters. This debris is composed of tiny chipped-off parts of spacecraft, dead satellites, spent rocket boosters, and other human-made junk. Hundreds of pieces of space junk and thousands of meteorites fall to Earth each year, though they mostly land in the oceans and unpopulated areas on land.\n\nMcDowell said that he couldn\u2019t find any \u201cobvious space debris candidates\u201d to explain the object, or objects. But he added that \u201csometimes takes a few days for relevant data to come in\u201d on databases such as Space Track.\n\nThis space debris data \u201cis based on radar tracking of objects and, sometimes, detection of reentry fireballs by infrared surveillance satellites,\u201d McDowell explained in an email.\n\nSernageomin officials collected soil samples from the sites of the fires and will conduct a more thorough analysis of them in the laboratory. Closer examination could reveal debris that is not visible to the naked eye, which would help solve the mystery of what type of object flamed out in the skies of Chilo\u00e9 Island last week.", "description": "A meteor?
