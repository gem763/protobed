Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), urged her fellow Democrats to stop their bickering, warning that \u201ca house divided cannot stand.\u201d\n\nThursday night brought into sharp relief the way America\u2019s two major political parties have been reshaped by Trump. After an unexpected 2016 loss, Democrats have struggled with whether to bolster or restrain the party\u2019s leftward shift. Republicans, meanwhile, have completely ceded the party\u2019s orthodoxy to a president whose views on trade, entitlements and political decorum bear little resemblance to traditional conservatism.\n\nBoth approaches carry major risks ahead of next year\u2019s presidential election. Democrats are desperate to unseat an unpopular president but divided about how to do it without alienating chunks of their base. Republicans, meanwhile, have largely coalesced around Trump, but it\u2019s far from clear that the president has a winning message for 2020.\n\nFor both parties, Trump is the main driver of the disruption, said Amy Walter, national editor of the Cook Political Report.\n\n\u201cDemocrats are trying to figure out who is the candidate that can play on Trump\u2019s terrain, which is different from any terrain we\u2019ve ever seen in modern politics,\u201d she said. \u201cFor Republicans, the ones who have criticized the president have either lost or left. . . . Distancing yourself from the top of the ticket is almost impossible now.\u201d\n\nThe competing trends are in some ways a reflection of a political landscape where a party in power rallies around its standard-bearer while the opposition seeks new strategies as it tries to regroup.\n\nBut, like many things involving Trump, they have been supercharged by a polarizing president who dominates the politics of both parties, Walter said.\n\nDuring Thursday\u2019s debate, several hopefuls used their opening statements to assert that Democrats were mostly united on the major issues of the day and shared the goal of defeating Trump.\n\nBut the veneer of unity quickly gave way as the 10 candidates onstage sparred over whether the party should pursue an agenda of transformational change or embrace a more incremental approach.\n\nThe debate began with a fierce exchange on health care, an issue that has come to represent a broader struggle within a party riven by ideological and generational fault lines.\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s yet said how much it\u2019s going to cost the taxpayer,\u201d Biden said after a lengthy discussion of the Medicare-for-all idea backed by Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).\n\nHe called Sanders a \u201csocialist\u201d with unrealistic ideas about how the private sector would respond to his plan.\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro jumped in and inaccurately accused Biden of changing his position within minutes, alluding to questions about the 76-year-old\u2019s age and mental acuity.\n\n\u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is why presidential debates are becoming unwatchable,\u201d South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg said after Castro claimed that he was the rightful bearer of Barack Obama\u2019s legacy, rather than Biden.\n\nThose fights underscore the deeper identity crisis roiling the party. Concerned that the president could repeat his 2016 performance in key states like Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, Democrats are conflicted over whether to focus on converting Trump voters or juicing enthusiasm among Democratic base voters who stayed home in 2016.\n\nNeither tactic is a sure bet. A Biden campaign makes it harder to engage the party\u2019s leftward flank.\n\nBut Warren or Sanders could drive away support among the suburban voters who have been turned off by Trump\u2019s presidency. And both have struggled to connect with nonwhite voters, a core Democratic constituency.\n\nThe candidates are also trying to determine how to address the legacy of Obama, a popular Democratic president who nonetheless faced criticism from some liberals over immigration and other issues.\n\nBiden, who served as Obama\u2019s vice president for eight years, has hewed most closely to the record and policies of the former president.\n\n\u201cI stand with Barack Obama all eight years, good, bad and indifferent,\u201d Biden said at the debate when challenged over the Obama administration\u2019s record on deportations.\n\n\n\nSanders and Warren have promised broader change than what Obama pursued, arguing that a more ambitious approach is needed to address income inequality and the conditions that gave rise to Trump.\n\nAs Democrats debate, Trump has repeatedly celebrated the support he has received from his party.\n\n\u201c94% Approval Rating in the Republican Party!\u201d Trump tweeted Saturday, repeating a \u201chigh and very beautiful number\u201d not backed by public polling. Various polls have put Trump\u2019s approval rating among Republicans at 80 to 90 percent.\n\nBut at the House GOP retreat in Baltimore, the president could easily get the impression of unanimous party support from a caucus that lost its majority in last year\u2019s midterm elections.\n\n\u201cThe Republicans have never been more united,\u201d McCarthy said at one point.\n\nTrump\u2019s takeover of the party was evident throughout the three-day retreat in Baltimore. The schedule included breakout sessions on foreign policy, the military and politics but nothing on reducing the national debt or entitlement reform.\n\nThose once fundamental conservative priorities largely have been left behind in the Trump era. In 2018, Republicans passed a massive tax cut that ballooned the deficit. Then Trump, never keen on big spending cuts, shot down then-speaker Paul D. Ryan\u2019s plea to tackle entitlements.\n\nOn Thursday, the Treasury Department reported that the government\u2019s budget deficit had surpassed $1 trillion, with a month left in the fiscal year.\n\n\u201cIt used to be the case that establishment Republicans were very attentive to the fiscal situation,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cBut there is no political anchor now around fiscal discipline.\u201d\n\nThe president has been able to consolidate Republican support by pushing an us-against-them message that many in the party have replicated on the campaign trail.\n\n\u201cWith the grim specter of socialism descending on the Democrat party, it\u2019s up to all of us to ensure the survival of American liberty,\u201d Trump said during his speech Thursday. He mocked Buttigieg\u2019s height, described Biden as \u201csleepy Joe\u201d and referred to Sanders as \u201ccrazy.\u201d\n\nPrivately, Republicans acknowledge that Trump\u2019s divisiveness has created a problem for them in suburbs. In 2018, Republicans lost 40 seats to Democrats, including 29 incumbents. GOP leaders, now in the minority, had tried to explain to the president that they needed his help stopping the suburban bleeding.\n\nHighly educated suburban voters are leaving the party, making it harder for Republicans to take back control of the House. At least 17 House Republicans, including the caucus\u2019 only black member, have already announced their intention to retire, resign or seek another office.\n\nBut Trump has encountered little public resistance within his party for his scorched-earth political strategy, which has at times included racist language. Republican senators including Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Lindsey O. Graham of South Carolina, both onetime Trump critics facing reelection this year, have either gone silent or transformed into cheerleaders for a president who prizes loyalty.\n\nTrump\u2019s erratic approach to foreign policy and trade has forced the party to abandon many of its core tenets and left an ideological hole that\u2019s often filled by the president\u2019s Twitter account.\n\nA spat between Rep. Liz Cheney (Wyo.) and Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.) laid bare the internal divisions that persist within the GOP between its hawks and its libertarians. As Trump has vacillated between muscular rhetoric and an \u201cAmerica first\u201d approach to foreign policy, both Cheney and Paul have sought to claim the mantle of Trumpism despite their very different views on foreign policy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just grateful for a president who, unlike you, supports stopping these endless wars,\u201d Paul tweeted at Cheney on Thursday.\n\nA day earlier, Cheney tweeted: \u201cI stand with @realDonaldTrump and our men and women in uniform who will never surrender to terrorists, unlike @RandPaul.\u201d\n\nStill, Trump\u2019s campaign says the party will be unified going into 2020 in part because Democrats have moved far to the left. Trump has said publicly that even Republicans who don\u2019t like him \u201chave no choice\u201d but to vote for him.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign has worked to stifle any internal challenges to the president\u2019s reelection, working with state party leaders to ensure a smooth path to the GOP nomination for the president. Republican parties in South Carolina, Arizona, Nevada and Kansas have canceled their primaries and caucuses, all but ensuring that Trump will win their states\u2019 delegates. The moves have led to outcry from Trump\u2019s primary challengers.\n\nBut the president has made it clear that party unity will be a key part of his political strategy as 2020 approaches.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ve always said about the Democrats, they\u2019re lousy politicians but they have one thing that\u2019s incredible: They stick together,\u201d Trump told the GOP leaders in Baltimore. \u201cAnd you people have to stick together. And you do. I know you.\u201d", "description": "Democrats are locked in an identity crisis and Republicans have ceded the party\u2019s orthodoxy.", "authors": ["Toluse Olorunnipa", "White House Reporter", "Rachael Bade", "Congressional Reporter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/85wf9JJ-wDlmLZluQrW1kUsZyAo=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RSN3W6GXE4I6TBVMB4SQZSIXLA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
