The NYPD could not confirm the report.\n\nCharles Kiwacz, 31, said he saw the Aurora shooting as \"an isolated incident.\"\n\n\"I don't think there's any fear at all. I think it's the exact opposite - people wanting to go out and show that this movie can be just that - just a movie,\" the podcast host and producer said as he bought a ticket for \"Joker\" near New York's Times Square.\n\nCostumes and face masks have been banned for moviegoers at two U.S. theater chains - AMC and Landmark - while the Alamo Drafthouse cinema group warned parents not to bring their children.\n\nThe Parents Television Council (PTC), a media watchdog, issued a similar warning on Thursday. \"Parents may believe that this film is appropriate for kids given that is an extension of the popular Batman franchise,\" the PTC said in a statement.\n\nMovie studio Warner Bros. said last week that the film was not an endorsement of real-world violence.\n\n\"It is not the intention of the film, the filmmakers or the studio to hold this character up as a hero,\" Warner Bros. said in a statement.\n\nDespite the controversy, the movie is expected to take in a bumper $80 million or more on its opening weekend in North America, according to box-office analysts.\n\n\"Joker\" director Todd Phillips criticized people who have attacked the film without seeing it.\n\n\"I didn't imagine the level of discourse that it's reached in the world, honestly,\" Variety reported him as saying at the New York Film Festival on Wednesday.\n\n\"I think it's OK that it sparks conversations and there are debates around it. The film is the statement and it's great to talk about it, but it's much more helpful if you've seen it.\"\n\n(Reporting by Jill Serjeant in Los Angeles and Maria Caspani in New York; Editing by Peter Cooney)", "description": "NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Police in major U.S. cities were on alert on Thursday as \"Joker\" opened in movie theaters after weeks of publicity surrounding its disturbing portrait of a bullied loner raised fears it might spark violence.", "authors": ["Maria Caspani"], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
