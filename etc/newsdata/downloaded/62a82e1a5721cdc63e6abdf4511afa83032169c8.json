Mark Milley on Friday insisted that the fight against ISIS in Syria had not stopped.\n\nThe SDF \u201cis still guarding prisoners in the area that have been detained over time,\u201d he told reporters at the Pentagon while acknowledging the Turkish incursion \u201chas had some effect\u201d on the ISIS fight.\n\nThe administration insists Turkey will be responsible for detaining ISIS fighters, but Brett McGurk, who resigned as Trump\u2019s special envoy to the anti-ISIS coalition in December, warned Turkey \u201chas neither the intent, desire, nor capacity\u201d to manage ISIS detainees.\n\n\u201cBelieving otherwise is a reckless gamble with our national security,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nUS reputation damaged for future partnerships\n\nIn defending his decision to pull back U.S. troops, Trump has claimed he is fulfilling a campaign promise to halt \u201cendless wars.\u201d\n\nBut in leaving the SDF to fend for itself, lawmakers warn Trump has sent a chilling message to allies and potential U.S. partners who may want help in future conflicts.\n\nThe Trump administration \"cut deal with [Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan] allowing him to wipe [the Kurds] out.

MORE (R-Texas) are among the Republicans who have supported the legislation so far.\n\nThe Democratic chairman and ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee said Friday they will also introduce legislation to slap sanctions on Turkey.\n\nWashington's relationship with Ankara is further strained\n\nThe relationship between the U.S. and Turkey has been tense over the last several years and was made all the worse in July after Ankara purchased a Russian air defense system.\n\nThe system is incompatible with other NATO systems and led the United States to remove Turkey from the F-35 joint strike fighter program, with U.S. national security personnel fearing the Russian system would allow the Kremlin to glean sensitive and protected information from the advanced fighter jet.\n\nEsper on Friday said the United States is \u201cgreatly disappointed\u201d by Turkey\u2019s offensive in Syria and that it had damaged the already tense relationship between the two countries.\n\nMaking matters worse, U.S. Special Forces troops stationed in Syria came under artillery fire from Turkey late Friday, even as Milley earlier in the day said the Turkish military \u201cis fully aware, down to explicit grid coordinate detail, of the locations of U.S. forces.\u201d\n\nThe Pentagon maintained it \u201cremains opposed\u201d to the operation, especially \u201cin areas where the Turks know U.S. forces are present,\u201d and warned Turkey it may respond if U.S. troops are threatened.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. demands that Turkey avoid actions that could result in immediate defensive action,\u201d Navy Capt. Brook DeWalt said in a statement.\n\nRising tensions were underscored when the leaders of the House Foreign Relations panel signaled their support for legislation to slap sanctions on Turkey. The bipartisan bill would sanction Turkish officials and banks until the country ends its military operations in Syria.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Friday also threatened \u201cpowerful sanctions\u201d against Ankara and said the United States \u201ccan shut down the Turkish economy if we need to.\u201d\n\nErdo\u011fan said the same day, however, that Turkey \u201cwill not take a step back\u201d from its offensive.\n\nRussia, Iran empowered by move\n\nTrump\u2019s decision in northern Syria has left a potential power vacuum in the area, with security experts and former U.S. officials calling the move \u201ca gift\u201d to U.S. adversaries such as Russia and Iran.\n\n\u201cTrump tonight after one call with a foreign leader provided a gift to Russia, Iran, and ISIS,\u201d McGurk said Monday on Twitter.\n\nMoscow and Tehran have both inserted their militaries into Syria\u2019s eight-year civil war, bolstering Syrian President Bashar Assad, while the United States has imposed sanctions on Russia for its support of the Assad government.\n\nNational security experts fear that Russian President Vladimir Putin Vladimir Vladimirovich PutinEx-top Trump Russia aide to testify about 'shadow policy' on Ukraine: report The Russian offensive in Africa and America's feeble response Cheney says Congress 'must and will' act after Turkey launches 'sickening' offensive in Syria MORE, who has made no secret of extending the Kremlin\u2019s influence into the Middle East, will use Trump\u2019s move as an opportunity to gain more of a foothold in Syria.\n\nPutin late this week called on foreign militaries to leave Syria as Turkey continued to wage its offensive while signaling that Russian forces would stay in the country until a new Syrian government tells Moscow it doesn't need any more help.\n\nRussia already counts Turkey as a friend, with Moscow selling a missile defense system to Ankara earlier this year, drawing the ire of Washington.\n\nFormer CIA Deputy Director John McLaughlin slammed Trump for \"impulsive and reckless instincts,\" calling his move this week \u201ca disaster on multiple levels.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe kingmakers will be U.S. rivals Russia and Iran, working with a wandering U.S. ally, Turkey,\u201d McLaughlin wrote Thursday.", "description": "President Trump this week showed no sign of backing down on his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria, stoking fears in Washington of worst-case scenarios from abandoning a crucial defense partner.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/syria_kurds_101119getty_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
