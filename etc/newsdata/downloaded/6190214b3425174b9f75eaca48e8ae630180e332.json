To put it bluntly, they are caravans without wheels,\" said the chief executive.\n\nBut Ms McVey said the modular building industry had the potential to create \"skilled, high-quality jobs for life\".\n\nThe former Cabinet minister said the burgeoning construction sector had the potential to be the next \"Silicon Valley\" - a reference to San Francisco's technology home where Google and Facebook are based.\n\n\"With our emphasis on safety, quality and beauty, we could be the global leaders in housing standards,\" she said.\n\n\"And, if we get it right, once the industry matures it could be worth an estimated \u00a340 billion to this country. A new post-Brexit industry.\"\n\nShe said there would need to be a \"brand-new workforce\" to make homes offsite and pushed for the North of England to \"embrace\" the technology.\n\n\"The North of England has the potential to be the construction capital of the country for this new technology, and we need to fully embrace this,\" said the former broadcaster, who was giving the speech on her birthday.\n\n\"This could be a new hub. Think Silicon Valley - the 'construction corridor'.\"\n\nHuge names in the construction industry, such as Laing O'Rourke and Manchester-based Urban Splash, have already started investing in the technology in a bid to cut costs and speed up delivery.\n\nAs well as the \u00a338 million announced on Thursday, the Government has already issued \u00a32.5 billion in funding to support small-to-medium-sized businesses and innovators through its Home Building Fund.", "description": "The Government's housing agency has given \u00a338 million of construction-boosting cash mainly to councils in the South", "authors": ["Patrick Daly", "Nicola Bartlett", "Image", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20724543.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_BRITAIN-EU-POLITICS-BREXIT.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
