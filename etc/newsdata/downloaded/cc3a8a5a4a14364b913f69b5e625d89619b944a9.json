That means they\u2019re cutting down on the \u201clow-quality\u2019 carbohydrates they eat.\n\nUnhealthy eating habits, of course, can hurt your health. These include -- but are not limited to -- a higher risk for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and some cancers.\n\n\u201cObesity is related to 13 types of cancers, so there is an implication for cancer risk,\u201d Dr. Fang Fang Zhang, an associate profession at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University and an investigator in this study, said in an interview with ABC News. She added that low-quality carbohydrates contribute to obesity.\n\nThe CDC highlights a healthy eating plan, as recommended by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2015-2020. They recommend a balanced diet that focuses on whole grains, lean meats, fish, eggs, poultry, nuts, fruits, vegetables, and fat-free/low-fat dairy products.\n\nIn this study, researchers in Boston examined the dietary habits of over 43,000 US adults. Data was collected from multiple cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey which looked at American\u2019s diets.\n\nWhat percentage is carbohydrates, or proteins, or fat? Look at the imbalance: low-quality carbohydrates account for 42% of the calories we consume daily, and only 9% of our calories are from high-quality carbohydrates. Believe it or not, that\u2019s better than it used to be. Data from 1999 showed that low-quality carbohydrates made up over 45% of our diets while high-quality carbohydrates only accounted for about 7% of our diets.\n\nZhang explained, \u201cour findings suggest that Americans are improving their diets overall and have made some progress in some areas. However, the progress that we have made has not yet brought us to where we want to be. We still consume a large proportion of total calories from low-quality carbohydrates.\u201d\n\nLiz Weinandy, MPH, RD, is the lead outpatient dietician at Ohio State University\u2019s Wexner Medical Center. She explained, \u201chigh-quality carbohydrates are less processed, like millet, quinoa, or fruit.\u201d Low-quality carbohydrates are more processed and, as a result, \u201cyou strip them of their vitamins and nutrients,\u201d she added. Weinandy was not involved in the study.\n\nSTOCK PHOTO/Shutterstock\n\nWhy are people changing what they eat?\n\nZhang believes \u201cthese are related to increased public awareness of health benefits related to whole grains and the health risks associated with added sugar.\u201d\n\nWeinandy agrees. \u201cResearch is really starting to clearly show how bad sugar is in our bodies. People are trying to avoid it.\u201d She has even noticed changes in her daily practice. She reports seeing more people adopting low-carbohydrate diets like the ketogenic diet and eating more whole-food, plant-based diets.\n\nOne reason, they believe, is the impact of policy change. Zhang shared, \u201cWe have some movements in policy to reduce added sugar consumption. Several cities have enacted a tax on sugar. Also, the FDA now requires disclosure on added sugars in nutritional labels on packaged foods.\u201d\n\nA recent study even evaluated the effects of a \u201csugar tax.\u201d\n\nHowever, there is still more that we need to do.\n\nThe changes the study found were not universal for all groups of people. Zhang shares, \u201cpeople with lower education and income levels, had a lower improvement in diet.\u201d She believes, \u201cwe need to make efforts to increase availability and affordability in low resource communities.\u201d\n\nOne way to combat this may be through adding resources through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Plan (SNAP) for healthier eating. Weinandy shares that the Environmental Working Group also has resources for eating well on a budget.\n\nAnother target would be focusing on refined or processed grains. \u201cHighly processed packaged foods have more low-quality carbohydrates\u201d and are eaten more often because of their convenience, says Zhang. \u201cI think this is an area we need to focus on in the future.\u201d\n\nThe overall changes are promising but Americans will need to continue to improve our diets. It\u2019s one of the keys to \u201clive longer and have a better quality of life,\u201d says Weinandy.\n\nTulsie N.
