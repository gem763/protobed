They served as a source of inspiration, you can go all the way back to 'Swingers\"... They can express whatever opinion they like.\u201d\n\n'AVENGERS' STAR ELIZABETH OLSEN EXPLAINS WHY WE NEED 'ALL REPRESENTATIONS OF SUPERHEROES'\n\nEarlier this month, Scorsese, 76, compared Marvel movies to theme parks, and said they're \"not cinema.\"\n\nCoppola, 80, agreed with him, calling the movies \"despicable.\"\n\n\u201cWhen Martin Scorsese says that the Marvel pictures are not cinema, he\u2019s right, because we expect to learn something from cinema, we expect to gain something, some enlightenment, some knowledge, some inspiration,\u201d Coppola said at a recent award ceremony. \u201cI don\u2019t know that anyone gets anything out of seeing the same move over and over again. Martin was kind when he said it\u2019s not cinema. He didn\u2019t say it\u2019s despicable, which I just say it is.\u201d\n\nVeteran director Ken Loach jumped on board as well while speaking with Sky News.\n\n\"They're made as commodities like hamburgers, and it's not about communicating, and it's not about sharing our imagination,\" said Loach, 83. \"It's about making a commodity which will make a profit for a big corporation \u2013 they're a cynical exercise. They're a market exercise, and it has nothing to do with the art of cinema.\"\n\nJames Gunn, director of \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" and its sequel, fired back on Twitter, saying that he remembers being upset when people slammed Scorsese's \"The Last Temptation of Christ,\" and is \"saddened by how (Scorsese's) now judging my films in the same way.\"\n\nSimilarly, on his Instagram, Gunn, 53, shared a message saying: \"Many of our grandfathers thought all gangster movies were the same, often calling them \u201cdespicable.\" Some of our great grandfathers thought the same of westerns, and believed the films of John Ford, Sam Peckinpah, and Sergio Leone were all exactly the same.\"\n\n\"...not everyone will be able to appreciate them, even some geniuses. And that's okay,\" added Gunn.\n\nGunn and Favreau aren't the only members of the Marvel family to weigh in. Robert Downey Jr., Samuel L. Jackson, Natalie Portman and Sebastian Stan have all expressed their opinions.\n\nDowney, 54, who famously played Tony Stark in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, also spoke about Scorsese's comments in an interview with Howard Stern, expressing thoughts similar to Favreau's.\n\n\"I appreciate his opinion because I think it\u2019s like anything \u2014 we need all of the different perspectives, so we can come to center and move on,\u201d Downey Jr. said, prompting Stern to ask if he was insulted by the dig.\n\nWhen asked whether Scorsese's comments insulted him, Downey responded: \u201cIt would be like saying Howard Stern isn\u2019t radio... It makes no sense to say it.\u201d\n\nROBERT DOWNEY JR. STARS IN FIRST POST-MARVEL ROLE: DR. DOLITTLE\n\nJackson, 70, another staple of the franchise also fired back.\n\n\"I mean, that\u2019s like saying Bugs Bunny ain\u2019t funny. Films are films. Everybody doesn\u2019t like his stuff, either,\u201d Jackson told Variety. \u201cEverybody\u2019s got an opinion, so I mean it\u2019s okay. Ain\u2019t going to stop nobody from making movies.\u201d\n\nPortman, 38, who was once a very vocal critic of the franchise, is set to return for \"Thor: Love and Thunder,\" and said to The Hollywood Reporter: \"I think there's room for all types of cinema. There's not one way to make art.\"\n\nIn a press junket, Stan, 37, refuted Coppola's claims.\n\n\"People have been going up to me like, 'Thank you so much for this character,' 'This movie helped me out so much,' 'This movie inspired me. Now I feel better. Now I feel less alone,' so how can you say these movies are not helping people?\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe next Marvel film slated for release is \"Black Widow,\" which will hit theaters in May of 2020.", "description": "\"Iron Man\" and \"Iron Man 2\" director Jon Favreau has opened up about the recent debate surrounding the quality of Marvel films.", "authors": ["Nate Day"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Jon-Favreau.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
