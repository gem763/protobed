Despite his staggering, the league\u2019s concussion spotters did not step in to have Shepard checked for a concussion.\n\nGiants beat writer Pat Leonard pointed out that two of Shepard\u2019s teammates were \u201cpointing\u201d at Shepard at the time, perhaps to get a team trainer to help him, but Shepard remained in the game.\n\nShepard is not fully healed yet and will be out for the Giants\u2019 Week 2 game against Buffalo.\n\nBut Kevin Zeitler and Jon Halapio are pointing at Shepard after the play, down on the ground. So the #Giants saw it. And Shepard stayed in the game.
