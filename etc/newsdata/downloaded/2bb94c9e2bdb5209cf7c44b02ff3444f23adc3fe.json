The page for that stream is already live, and there is an option to set a reminder on the page to be alerted when the event actually starts.\n\nThe YouTube event, and the reminder, can be found here.\n\nIt will be streaming the event in its traditional way, too, on its own website. That can be found by heading to this link, either on an up-to-date iOS device or a newer desktop operating system and browser.\n\nAs ever, Apple will offer the option to stream through the Apple TV, too. The \"special events\" app should already have appeared on your dashboard, if you have an Apple TV, and the live stream will appear at the relevant time.\n\nApple will also allow people to watch the event in real life, at various stores. Which ones, and details to sign up, can be found on the Today at Apple page.\n\n\"Come and join us at the Apple Store for a livestream of the Apple Special Event from the Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino,\" the description of the event on Apple's website reads. \"We\u2019re excited to watch some of the latest news from Apple with you.\"\n\nEverything will kick off at 10am local pacific time.
