The headbands, priced at $25 apiece, have raised more than $30,000 for the hospital, according to Davis.\n\n\"We've been able to turn it into a positive and use it to raise funds for a hospital that's trying to rebuild this emergency room. And just to have the support of the community -- and pretty much nationwide -- it's been amazing,\u201d Davis said, according to ESPN. \u201cAnd then on top of that, being blessed to win the appeal and be able to take those funds that I was already counting as a loss and further contribute to the cause, it's just a major blessing. And I don't take it for granted.\"\n\nLOS ANGELES RAMS' CLAY MATTHEWS HAS JAW WIRED SHUT AS HE RECOVERS FROM INJURY\n\nDavis said he didn\u2019t know why the NFL rescinded his fine. \u201cI didn't get the specific reason why it was overturned. I mean, when you get something like that overturned and you get $7,000 coming back to you, you ain't asking too many questions,\u201d he said.\n\nThe NFL fines players for wearing \u201cpersonal messages\u201d on their uniforms, except during the \u201cMy Cause, My Cleats\u201d program, in which players can promote causes important to them with decorated cleats during Game Weeks 13-15. In his appeal, Davis said his agents had included \u201cnot knowing about it [the rule], it not being something that was offensive, that I wasn't going to wear it again and that I was going to use it for charity.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"No matter the case, whether I'm wearing a headband, or whether I'm not wearing a headband, whether I'm talking about a headband, I'm not talking about a headband, I'm always using my platform to glorify God,\" Davis said. \"And that's never going to change. Because I believe he's the one who gave me this platform for that purpose to make his name known. So I'll always be about that.\"", "description": "New Orleans Saints linebacker Demario Davis won an appeal for a $7,000 fine from the NFL for wearing a religious headband and said he would give the fine money to a hospital in his home state of Mississippi.", "authors": ["Morgan Phillips"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/DeMario-Davis.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
