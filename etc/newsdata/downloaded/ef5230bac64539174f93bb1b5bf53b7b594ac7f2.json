Federal prosecutors alleged StarKist conspired with others to fix canned tuna prices from November 2011 to December 2013.\n\n\"We have cooperated with the DOJ during the course of its investigation and accept responsibility,\u201d said Andrew Choe, StarKist president and CEO.\n\nThe company, which is owned by South Korean company Dongwon Industries, had asked U.S. District Court Judge Edward Chen to reduce the fine to $50 million, arguing the penalty could result in bankruptcy since it faces other civil damages. Chen said he found the company had assets and the ability to borrow money to pay up.\n\nThe scheme was revealed when Chicken of the Sea unsuccessfully attempted to purchase San Diego-based Bumble Bee Foods in 2015. Chicken of the Sea executives alerted federal authorities and agreed to cooperate in exchange for avoiding criminal prosecution.\n\nBumble Bee pleaded guilty to the same charge as StarKist in 2017 and paid a $25 million fine.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTwo former executives of Bumble Bee and one from StarKist have also each pleaded guilty to price-fixing charges.
