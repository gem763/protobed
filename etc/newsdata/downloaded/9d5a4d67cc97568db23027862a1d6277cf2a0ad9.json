It produced 11.31 million dry metric tonnes of the\n\nmaterial between January and June, compared with 11.01 million\n\ntonnes in the same period last year, the Mines and Geosciences\n\nBureau (MGB) said on Tuesday.\n\nThe Philippines and Indonesia are the top two producers\n\nglobally.\n\nSixteen of the Philippines' 31 nickel mines were shut in the\n\nfirst half for either maintenance or suspension of operations\n\nfor environmental and other offences, the MGB said in its\n\nquarterly industry report.\n\nThe Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR)\n\nlast year issued a resolution suspending the operations of\n\nseveral mines, including some nickel producers, following audits\n\nto assess their compliance with environmental\n\nregulations. The DENR lifted the suspension order on three mines over the\n\npast nine months, while the MGB has recommended the same action\n\nfor two others, Environment Undersecretary Analiza Teh said in a\n\nspeech at a Philippine mining conference on Tuesday.\n\nFive other mines suspended have yet to comply fully with the\n\nrequirements for lifting the suspension, she said.\n\n\"We expect output in the number one global producer, the\n\nPhilippines, to begin to rise in 2019 as some of the currently\n\nsuspended mines become operational,\" Fitch Solutions Macro\n\nResearch said in a note.\n\nLast year the Philippines' nickel ore output dropped 4% to\n\n25.9 million dry metric tonnes, putting it behind Indonesia. It\n\nretook the top spot in the first half of this year.\n\nFitch expects nickel ore output in the Philippines \"to\n\nremain modest over the coming years due to a stringent\n\nregulatory environment and high levels of policy uncertainty,\n\nwhich will constrain project development\".\n\nIt forecasts average annual growth of 2.5% in Philippine\n\noutput over 2019 to 2028.\n\nPhilippine nickel miners are likely to boost ore production\n\nnext year, but may still not be able to fill up a supply gap to\n\nbe created when Indonesia halts its ore exports, industry\n\nexecutives have said. Indonesia has decided to stop nickel ore exports from Jan.\n\n1, 2020, two years earlier than initially flagged as it speeds\n\nup efforts to process more of its resources at home.\n\n", "description": "UPDATE 1-Philippines H1 nickel ore output rises 3% despite mine shutdowns", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_2_800x533_L_1412601599.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
