You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nTo help put a stop to the mistreatment members of the community face and to also mark its 20th anniversary, the charity is planning to launch a unique festival that will celebrate people\u2019s \u201cunique identities and bring some joy into the world\u201d.\n\nSpeaking to Metro, Anjum Mauj, a lesbian campaigner and a trustee at Imaan, said that while the charity is doing its best to supports LGBT+ Muslims, many still feel unable to come out, which is why a festival that gives marginalised people a voice is so important.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

You can donate to the cause here.\n\nThe festival follows ongoing anti-LGBT+ education protests outside primary schools across the country.\n\nIn July, a primary school that faced weekly protests from parents over LGBT+ lessons announced it would be bringing back an equality programme after it was suspended following a series of demonstrations.\n\nThe No Outsiders programme, which uses story books to teach about same-sex couples, was relaunched at Parkfield Community School in Birmingham after months of consultation.\n\nThe row at the school gates sparked more protests at the nearby Anderton Park primary school and led to a political debate over what age was appropriate to teach children about LGBT+ couples.", "description": "A UK charity has announced plans to launch the first ever pride festival dedicated to celebrating LGBT+ Muslims.", "authors": ["Sarah Young"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/23/10/muslim-london-pride.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
