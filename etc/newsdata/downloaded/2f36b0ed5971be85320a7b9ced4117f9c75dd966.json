It is said to have been shifted to a separate system meant for high-risk security information, despite the call allegedly not including any information that merited such a move.\n\nThe root of such a move can be traced back to calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia early in the Trump presidency, according to reports in the Wall Street Journal over the weekend. Both calls in early 2017 were politically damaging to the president, including rubbishing a refugee agreement former president Barack Obama had set up with Australia and Trump calling out \u201cbad hombres\u201d during the call with Mexico.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

In that case it is easy to see how such action could have led to how the Ukraine call was handled.\n\nSuch leaks is also said to have fed into Trump\u2019s constant claims that a \u201cdeep state\u201d of government officials were seeking to damage his damage from the off. In such a climate the president has repeatedly out his trust in a number of people outside the government and has allowed them to interact with state apparatus.\n\nTrump\u2019s personal lawyer, the former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, is the latest to wield that access. He is mentioned in the call with Zelensky and for months has been seeking to support Trump\u2019s unproven theory that there is something rotten at the heart of the Democrats \u2013 and particularly Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden.\n\nWhen that outside influence rebounds \u2013 as it has done this time with Giuliani becoming the current centre of the impeachment investigation \u2013 there is fallout. Trump\u2019s envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker is said to have offered his resignation to secretary of state Mike Pompeo after the whistleblower complaint alleged that Volker had helped connect Giuliani to Ukrainian officials.\n\nTrump and Giuliani rage about the \u201cwitch hunt\u201d that is being perpetrated against them \u2013 insisting they have done nothing wrong \u2013 but the spark that created the current scandal can be traced back right to the start of the 45th president\u2019s beginnings in the White House.", "description": "Donald Trump promised a presidency unlike any other and a decent argument to be made that he has offered just that \u2013 but he is now reaping the dubious rewards of his freewheeling nature.
