Detained me,\" in text messages seen by AFP.\n\nHe was released late Friday evening, though said police confiscated two computers, several cameras and phones and other electronics and books.\n\nA local police officer earlier told AFP he was not aware of the arrest, while the ministry of foreign affairs did not return a request for comment.\n\nHuman Rights Watch swiftly deplored Thinh's disappearance, saying it \"shows the authorities' incredible intolerance for any sort of criticism,\" according to deputy Asia director Phil Robertson.\n\nThinh's work has irked officials in Vietnam, a one-party state where critics and activists are routinely jailed.\n\nIn a 2018 exhibition, he featured art by three death row prisoners he believes were wrongly accused.\n\nThe palm-size figurines of animals made from plastic bags were smuggled out by the inmates' relatives, and Thinh hoped the show would help raise awareness.\n\n\"These animals were the voices of the death row prisoners,\" he told AFP in a 2018 interview.\n\nThinh also exhibited photos of Hanoi residents who claimed they had been displaced from their land, and on Facebook posted about Hong Kong democracy protests and environmental issues.\n\nAll artworks must be approved by official censors before being displayed publicly in conservative Vietnam, where scores of critics are behind bars.\n\nThe country has seen an uptick in arrests for online posts since a controversial cybersecurity bill was passed in January, according to Amnesty International.", "description": "A Vietnamese artist who exhibited controversial works on land rights issues and death row inmates said he was briefly detained in the communist state intolerant of dissidence of any kind.
