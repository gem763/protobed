Bianca Andreescu Captures the U.S. Open Title", "language": "en", "text": "Tennis used to be famous for its young comets\u2014preternatural talents who arrived early and quickly ascended to the top.\n\nLately, however, the sport has been consumed by greatest-of-all-time G.O.A.T.s\u2014still-active, virtual living statues like the 37-year-old Serena Williams, and 33-year-old Rafael Nadal, both of whom made it once more to the final weekend at the U.S. Open.\n\nOn Saturday, the sprightly kids took one back.\n\nBianca Andreescu, a 19-year-old rising star from Canada, defeated Williams 6-3, 7-5 to win the 2019 U.S. Open women\u2019s singles tournament, becoming the first teenager to capture a major since Maria Sharapova won here in 2006.\n\nIt was a not-so-close-match which turned thrillingly competitive late. Showing a champion\u2019s heart, Williams rallied from a 1-5 second set deficit to even the set, and lift an enthralled, sold-out Arthur Ashe Stadium to its feet.\n\nBut in the end, The Kid halted The Comeback.\n\nSerena Williams reacts during Saturday\u2019s match.

Andreescu, the 15th seed, is the first Canadian player\u2014men\u2019s or women\u2019s\u2014to win a major singles tournament ever.\n\nBut her victory\u2014which follows Naomi Osaka\u2019s win here last September at age 20\u2014is not a shock.\n\nAfter starting the season ranked outside of the women\u2019s top 100 players, the Mississauga, Ontario-raised Andreescu has lately established herself as perhaps the most promising young player on tour, winning singles titles at Indian Wells and her hometown Canadian Open, where she prevailed when Williams retired with an injury in the final.\n\nFiery and fearless, Andreescu is fun to watch. She possesses a powerful, all-court game, and on Saturday, she used it to deconstruct an opponent widely considered the greatest women\u2019s tennis player of all time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so crazy,\u201d Andreescu said. \u201cI\u2019ve been dreaming of this moment for the longest time.\u201d\n\nWilliams, who turns 38 later this month, remains stuck on 23 major singles trophies, second behind only Margaret Court. Saturday\u2019s loss at the Open is her fourth consecutive defeat in a women\u2019s singles final. Her last tournament victory was at the 2017 Australian Open, which Williams won when she was seven weeks pregnant.\n\n\u201cAll of it is super frustrating,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI\u2019m so close, so close, so close and yet so far away.\u201d\n\nHeading into Saturday, there was optimism Williams would finally notch No. 24. She had played impressive tennis over the past two weeks, including dominant wins like her 44-minute demolition of Qiang Wang in the quarterfinals.\n\nBut in the final\u2014with onlookers including her friend Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex\u2014the 8th-seeded Williams struggled early. After jumping to a 40-15 lead, Williams dropped her serve in the first game of the match with a pair of double faults, and Andreescu held to go up 2-0.\n\nBianca Andreescu celebrates after winning the U.S. Open.

It was the Canadian teen\u2019s first appearance in a major final\u2014but she showed few of the nerves which often come with such a large-stage moment.\n\nEven with the crowd pulling heavily for Williams\u2014and also doing that tennis-tacky thing where they cheered Andreescu\u2019s mistakes\u2014Andreescu didn\u2019t back down. Williams late-second set rally appeared to briefly rattle Andreescu, but she seemed to steady once Williams tied the set at five-all.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to block everything out, but I think I did a pretty good job,\u201d Andreescu said.\n\nLike so many tennis up-and-comers, Andreescu worships Williams, who, amazingly, won her first U.S. Open before Andreescu was born. She even gives herself one of Williams\u2019s signature \u201cCome on!\u201d shouts during key points.\n\nWilliams counts herself as a fan. \u201cIf anyone else could win this tournament\u2026outside of [Williams\u2019s older sister] Venus\u2026I\u2019m happy it could be Bianca,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen it was over, Andreescu dropped her racket to the court, then crossed over to the other side of the net and collapsed to the ground in celebration.\n\n\u201cI just cannot believe it myself,\u201d Andreescu said.\n\nBelieve it. Canada has its first-ever NBA title\u2014and a brand new U.S. Open champion.\n\nShare Your Thoughts Is Bianca Andreescu the most exciting new player in women\u2019s tennis?
