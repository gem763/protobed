It is coated in a special substance that will begin to evaporate as it approaches the Sun, giving the ship a boost of jet acceleration without having to carry heavy engines.\n\nUsing the pressure of sunlight in this ingenious manner will allow the sailboat to speedily get to the mysterious Oort cloud at the edge of the solar system, where it\u2019s believed that comets are born.\n\n\u201cThe duration of flights to other stars is gigantic. The Voyager 1 high-speed space probe will take 300 years to reach the Oort cloud. Our sail can reach it in 20-30 years,\u201d said Professor Olga Starinova, of Samara University\u2019s Department of Space Engineering.\n\n\u201cThis means that we or the next generation will be able to obtain evidence of existence clouds, presumably generating all comets, and examine what remains of the formation of the solar system about 4.6 billion years ago,\u201d she explained.\n\nAlso on rt.com Russia invents self-destroying satellite to solve burgeoning \u2018space junk\u2019 problem\n\nThe highly advanced technology will also make it possible to prove fundamental laws of physics, such as Einstein\u2019s famous theory, that cannot be achieved under Earth\u2019s conditions. It will also be able to \u201cwarm\u201d Mars by reflecting the Sun\u2019s rays, helping to enable the colonization of the Red Planet.\n\nThe researchers have already calculated flights to all the other planets in the solar system and learned that small sailboats can be in orbits near Jupiter, Saturn or Mars for a long time, relaying scientific data back to Earth. They are now figuring out how to fly as close to the Sun as possible without burning in order to enable long-distance missions to neighboring star systems.\n\nLike this story?
