Mueller III\u2019s investigation; 3) the readout that the president released of his phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky; 4) the president\u2019s continuing refusal to produce documents or allow testimony by current and former government employees for pending investigations, as well as for oversight matters; and 5) other information now publicly available, including State Department text messages indicating that the release of essential military aid to Ukraine was conditioned on Ukraine\u2019s willingness to commence a criminal investigation designed to further the president\u2019s political interests.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the 1970s, we investigated serious abuses of presidential power by President Richard M. Nixon, including obstruction of justice, concealment of government records and misuse of government agencies to punish his political enemies. We prosecuted many of Nixon\u2019s aides for their complicity in Nixon\u2019s offenses. Rather than indicting the president, the grand jury named him an unindicted co-conspirator, delivered to the House a \u201croad map\u201d of the evidence implicating him in wrongdoing and deferred to the House\u2019s constitutional responsibility to address such presidential wrongdoing through the impeachment process.\n\nThe House, through its Judiciary Committee, fulfilled that responsibility by reviewing the evidence, interviewing witnesses and concluding that the facts warranted adopting three articles of impeachment: one for obstruction, one for abuse of power and one for contempt of Congress. Shortly thereafter, the president resigned rather than face a Senate trial.\n\nIn our considered view, the same three articles of impeachment could be specified against Trump, as he has demonstrated serious and persistent abuses of power that, in our view, satisfy the constitutional standard of \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d For example:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u25cf Trump conditioned protection of the military security of the United States and of an ally (Ukraine) on actions for his personal political benefit.\n\n\u25cf Trump subordinated the integrity of our national electoral process to his own personal political interest by soliciting and encouraging foreign government interference in our electoral process, including by Russia and China. He also appears to have demanded that Ukraine investigate a potential 2020 political opponent and pursue the conspiracy theory that Ukraine had interfered in the 2016 presidential election, despite the unanimous conclusion of the U.S. intelligence community that it was Russia that had interfered.\n\n\u25cf According to the evidence laid out in the Mueller report, Trump engaged in multiple acts of obstruction of justice in violation of federal criminal statutes and of his oath of office to \u201ctake care that the laws be faithfully executed.\u201d Because Mueller viewed Justice Department policy as precluding him from filing criminal charges against the president, the special counsel appropriately stated that these abuses are for Congress to address.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u25cf Trump obstructed lawful congressional investigations by systematically withholding evidence and by directing government agencies and employees to refuse to cooperate with legitimate oversight by Congress. Most significantly, the president\u2019s blanket refusal to honor requests for relevant information sought by House members conducting an impeachment inquiry constitutes impeachable contempt and obstruction. The public is entitled to know the facts, and Congress is the body our democracy has entrusted with uncovering them.\n\nThe Constitution provides for the elected representatives of the people to resort to impeachment in extraordinary circumstances showing that this drastic remedy is necessary to restrain, and possibly remove, a president who has engaged in high crimes and misdemeanors. Proper regard for reestablishing and protecting the rule of law requires firm and resolute action by the House. Lawmakers should not allow any refusal by the president to cooperate in its process to frustrate the performance of its constitutional duties.\n\nIf a bill of impeachment comes before the Senate, we urge all members of the Senate to put aside partisan loyalties and carry out their own constitutional duties courageously and honestly. In 1974, it was a group of Republican senators who put national interest over party loyalty and informed Nixon that his conduct was indefensible and would compel conviction by the Senate and removal from office. We hope the current Senate would similarly put honor and integrity above partisanship and personal political interest.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe following signers are all former members of the Justice Department\u2019s special prosecutor team that investigated the Watergate scandal:\n\nNick Akerman, former assistant U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York\n\nRichard Ben-Veniste, former member of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States\n\nRichard J.
