It will be empowered to make binding rulings on whether posts or ads violate the company\u2019s standards. Any other findings it makes will be considered \u201cguidance\u201d by Facebook.\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg announced plans to establish the board last November after FB, +1.00% ame under intense scrutiny for failures to protect user privacy and for its inability to quickly and effectively remove disinformation, hate speech and malign influence campaigns on its platform.\n\n\u201cFacebook should not make so many important decisions about free expression and safety on our own,\u201d he wrote at the time.\n\nCritics call the oversight board a bid by Facebook to forestall regulation or even an eventual breakup. The company faces antitrust investigations by the Federal Trade Commission, Congress and a group of state attorneys general.\n\n\u201cFacebook is attempting to normalize an approach to containing hate speech internally,\u201d said Dipayan Ghosh, a former Facebook policy adviser and a fellow at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School. \u201cIf it can illustrate that this approach can work, it can pacify the public itch to regulate the business model behind Facebook.\u201d\n\nThe multinational board will eventually comprise 40 members, who will collectively decide a few dozen cases a year, company executives told reporters in a conference call. It will at first hear only cases initiated by Facebook but will begin hearing appeals initiated by users in the first half of 2020, the company said. It will get to work as soon as 11 members are named.\n\nPriority cases will involve content that \u201cthreatens someone else\u2019s voice, safety, privacy, dignity or equality\u201d and affects a large number of people, Facebook said in blog post.\n\nExperts say the panel will have a limited range for decision-making, however. Local laws or directives from repressive governments might clash with its rulings, and Facebook might heed them for business reasons.\n\n\u201cHow to deal with authoritarian regimes is a deep issue for the platform, and for the world really,\u201d said Harvard law student Evelyn Douek, an Australian expert on content moderation.\n\nDouek says the group\u2019s charter, also released Tuesday, should insulate board members from public pressure and Facebook\u2019s commercial imperatives. But she believes the conditions under which members could be removed are still too vague.\n\nThe first few board members will be directly chosen by Facebook; they will then choose additional members. Facebook will also name the administrators of the trust that manages the Oversight Board and pays its members\u2019 salaries.\n\nBrent Harris, Facebook\u2019s director of governance, told reporters the company had not yet decided how much board members would be paid. He did not respond when asked how many hours a week would be expected of them in the part-time job. Facebook expects panelists will include former judges, editors, publishers and journalists, he said.\n\nThe board members\u2019 access to Facebook data will also be limited. \u201cThe board will have access to data that\u2019s pertinent to the case but no more,\u201d said Harris.\n\nOversight board members are to serve three-year terms with a maximum of three terms.\n\nThey can be removed by trustees for violations of a code of conduct that has yet to be drawn up. Panels of five will convene to review individual cases and decisions will be public, though data and privacy restrictions could apply. Harris said the board will have a staff that will initially consist of Facebook employees seconded from their jobs.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear where the permanent staff will eventually be located and how often oversight board members would meet in person to decide cases.", "description": "Facebook says it expects to name the first members of a quasi-independent oversight board by year-end.
