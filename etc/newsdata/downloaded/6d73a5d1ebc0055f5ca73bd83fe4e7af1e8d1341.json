warn over `appalling state of crisis\u00b4 in prison system", "language": "en", "text": "The prison system is in an \u201cappalling state of crisis\u201d and the Government has no clear plan for \u201cdesperately needed change\u201d, MPs have warned.\n\nSafety, security and decency are all lacking in jails across the country, according to a critical report from the Commons Justice Committee.\n\nMPs condemned the lack of a clear plan for reform and a long-term strategy to \u201creverse the fortunes\u201d of the prison estate and called for detailed plans of how the Government will meet a series of pledges it has made to increase funding and the number of cells, according to the findings.\n\nThe report said: \u201cToo often, prisons are identified as needing extra support, but their performance continues to decline.\n\n\u201cThere is little point in identifying poor performance if the necessary resources are not then provided to drive improvement.\u201d\n\nCommittee chairman Bob Neill said: \u201cThe prison system in England and Wales is enduring a crisis of safety and decency.\n\n(Michael Cooper/PA)\n\n\u201cToo often we have seen what might be called \u2018policy by press notice\u2019 without any clear or coherent vision for the future of the prison system.\n\n\u201cNew prison places might be welcome, but they do nothing to improve the appalling condition of much of the current prison estate, nor the prospect of offering a safe environment in which to rehabilitate offenders.\u201d\n\nAmid estimations that reoffending costs \u00a318 billion, Mr Neill said violence would not reduce in prisons without proper investment into rehabilitation and activities for inmates.\n\n\u201cAt any rate, given Government\u2019s poor track record in building prisons, we now want to see the detailed plans for the promised \u00a32.5 billion for 10,000 more places, what they\u2019ll look like and when they\u2019ll be up and running,\u201d he added.\n\nThe report also found:\n\n\u2013 The latest Government announcements had \u201crefreshed concerns over the near \u00a31 billion maintenance backlog on the appalling state of existing prison estate\u201d.\n\n\u2013 A funding plan stretching across several years is \u201curgently required\u201d, it said, adding: \u201cPrisons should be safe and decent environments that rehabilitate offenders \u2013 this not currently the case.\u201d\n\n\u2013 There were no guarantees that \u201cnecessary infrastructure\u201d would be put in place to avoid overcrowding of prisons in the future.\n\n\u2013 It added: \u201cThe Government\u2019s recent announcements on sentencing may over time result in a significantly increased prison population, without any guarantees that the necessary infrastructure will be put in place to avoid further overcrowding of prisons.\u201d\n\n\u2013 It urged the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) to move away \u201cas soon as possible\u201d from national contracts for management of facilities and look at smaller, localised arrangements so governors have more control and can adapt work to meet the needs of their prison.\n\n\u2013 There was still no clear accountability for individual prisons and whether the governor or the justice department were responsible.\n\n\u2013 It is taking too long to get important security equipment like body scanners into prisons.\n\n\u2013 The committee also reiterated its \u201cwide-ranging concerns\u201d about recruitment, retention of staff and the training and incentives available for them.\n\nPeter Dawson, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: \u201cThis report is a scathing indictment of a political failure.\n\n\u201cThe Government doesn\u2019t hesitate to promise more jail time for more people, but it has no plan for how to deliver a decent, safe or effective prison system to accommodate them.\n\n\u201cPeople\u2019s lives and public safety are at stake, and making \u2018policy by press notice\u2019 isn\u2019t good enough.\n\n\u201cThe people who live and work in prison deserve to be told when overcrowding will end, and dilapidated prisons finally be shut.\u201d\n\nFrances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: \u201cNow that we are heading into a volatile election period, it is important that all policy announcements are tempered with the use of evidence \u2013 and it starts with this vital report by the Justice Committee, which lays bare many of the problems in the prison system.\u201d\n\nShe accused politicians of too often using plans for prisons for \u201cpersonal political gain\u201d or to come up with \u201csuperficial quick-fix answers when, clearly, a more fundamental solution is needed\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u201cThe idea of constantly expanding the number of people in prison is simply untenable and at the root of the problem.\u201d\n\nA Ministry of Justice spokesman said: \u201cWe know many prisons face challenges but we have been confronting those head-on by recruiting over 4,400 extra officers in the last three years.\n\n\u201cThis Government is investing tens of millions in security and improving conditions, an extra \u00a3156 million for maintenance, \u00a3100 million to ramp up security and tackle drugs issues, and \u00a32.5 billion to create 10,000 additional prison places.\n\n\u201cWe also fully recognise the value of purposeful activity to reduce re-offending and cut crime, which is why we launched our Education and Employment Strategy which has led to hundreds of new businesses signing up to work with prisoners and help their rehabilitation.\u201d", "description": "Safety, security and decency are all lacking in jails across the country, according to a critical report from
