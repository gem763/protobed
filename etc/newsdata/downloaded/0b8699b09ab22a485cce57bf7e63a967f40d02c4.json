The anniversary coincides with a controversial debate in the U.S. about whether the country owes reparations to the descendants of slaves as compensation for centuries of injustice and inequality. It is a moment for posing questions of historic guilt and responsibility.\n\nBut the American side of the story is not the only one. Africans are now also reckoning with their own complicated legacy in the slave trade, and the infamous \u201cMiddle Passage\u201d often looks different from across the Atlantic.\n\nRecords from the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database, directed by historian David Eltis at Emory University, show that the majority of captives brought to the U.S. came from Senegal, Gambia, Congo and eastern Nigeria. Europeans oversaw this brutal traffic in human cargo, but they had many local collaborators. \u201cThe organization of the slave trade was structured to have the Europeans stay along the coast lines, relying on African middlemen and merchants to bring the slaves to them,\u201d said Toyin Falola, a Nigerian professor of African studies at the University of Texas at Austin. \u201cThe Europeans couldn\u2019t have gone into the interior to get the slaves themselves.\u201d\n\nChukwuma Hope Nwaubani in Umuahia, Nigeria, this month.

That silence is echoed in many African countries, where there is hardly any national discussion or acknowledgment of the issue. From nursery school through university in Nigeria, I was taught about great African cultures and conquerors of times past but not about African involvement in the slave trade. In an attempt to reclaim some of the dignity that we lost during colonialism, Africans have tended to magnify stories of a glorious past of rich traditions and brave achievement.\n\nBut there are other, less discussed chapters of our history. When I was growing up, my father Chukwuma Nwaubani spoke glowingly of my great-grandfather, Nwaubani Ogogo Oriaku, a chief among our Igbo ethnic group who sold slaves in the 19th century. \u201cHe was respected by everyone around,\u201d he said. \u201cEven the white people respected him.\u201d From the 16th to the 19th centuries, an estimated 1.4 million Igbo people were transported across the Atlantic as slaves.\n\nSome families have chosen to hide similar histories. \u201cWe speak of it in whispers,\u201d said Yunus Mohammed Rafiq, a 44-year-old professor of anthropology from Tanzania who now teaches at New York University\u2019s center in Shanghai. In the 19th century, Mr. Rafiq\u2019s great-great-great-grandfather, Mwarukere, from the Segeju ethnic group, raided villages in Tanzania\u2019s hinterland, sold the majority of his captives to the Arab merchants who supplied Europeans and kept the rest as laborers on his own coconut plantations. Although Mr. Rafiq\u2019s relatives speak of Mwarukere with pride, they expunged his name from family documents sometime in the 1960s, shortly after Tanzania gained independence from British colonial rule, when it was especially sensitive to remind Africans of their role in enslaving one another.\n\nYunus Mohammed Rafiq in Bagamoyo, Tanzania, Aug. 6.

Join the conversation below.\n\nLike Mr. Rafiq, I also felt apprehensive before deciding to write about my own family\u2019s history. I live in Nigeria but have extended family all over the U.S. How would black Americans respond to the descendants of a man who sold some of their ancestors into slavery? And if my own background was tainted with inhumanity, what authority would I have to lend my voice to the human rights issues in Nigeria and around Africa that cause me such grave concern?\n\nSome families feel no qualms about publicizing their own history. \u201cI\u2019m not ashamed of it because I personally wasn\u2019t directly involved,\u201d said 58-year-old Donald Duke, a lawyer who ran for president in Nigeria\u2019s 2019 elections. He is from the port town of Calabar, home to the Efik ethnic group of Nigeria\u2019s Cross River state. In the 18th century, some 1.2 million slaves were sold through Calabar, according to the Tulane University historian Randy J. Sparks. The Efik were mostly stevedores and middlemen. They negotiated prices between the white traders and their African partners from the hinterlands, then collected royalties. \u201cFamilies like mine benefited from that process,\u201d Mr. Duke told me.\n\nDonald Duke in Lagos, Nigeria, Aug. 1.

One of its exhibitions depicts various currencies of the slave trade, such as flutes, Dane guns and brass bells. \u201cIt is not a glorious past, but it is the truth,\u201d Mr. Duke said. \u201cThat is why I went out to document it.\u201d\n\nThe Zambian pastor Saidi Francis Chishimba also feels the need to go public with his family\u2019s history. \u201cIn Zambia, in a sense, it is a forgotten history,\u201d said the 45-year-old. \u201cBut it is a reality to which history still holds us accountable.\u201d Mr. Chishimba\u2019s grandfather, Ali Saidi Muluwe Wansimba, was from a tribe of slave traders of the Bemba kingdom, who moved from Zanzibar to establish slave markets in Zambia. He grew up hearing this history narrated with great pride by his relatives.\n\nIn 2011, he decided to see the place of his ancestor\u2019s origin and traveled with his wife to Zanzibar, an island off the coast of Tanzania. As they toured a memorial in what used to be one of the world\u2019s largest slave markets, the photos of limbs amputated from runaway slaves and the airless chambers that once held dozens of slaves at a time shocked him into silence. \u201cIt brought a saddening in my heart that my own family lines were involved in this treatment,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was so painful to think about.\u201d\n\nMr. Chishimba decided that this gruesome history should be openly acknowledged and has since become popular in Zambia for his sermons, radio talks and articles on the impact of the slave trade. He uses them as an opportunity to \u201cdemonstrate the grace of God\u201d even in so wicked a practice. He believes, for example, that mixing the races was always in God\u2019s plan and the slave trade was an effective device for dispersing black people from Africa to other parts of the world. \u201cWhat the devil meant for evil, God used it for good,\u201d he said.\n\nSaidi Francis Chishamba in Ingombe Ilede, Zambia, Aug. 8. Photo: Jonathan Torgovnik for The Wall Street Journal\n\nSome families feel cursed or burdened by their history and wish that they could be rid of it. \u201cWhat our ancestors did wasn\u2019t right,\u201d said 48-year-old Teddy Nwanunobi, a journalist from southeastern Nigeria. \u201cIf they had thought about the consequences, they wouldn\u2019t have done those things.\u201d His great-grandfather was an Igbo slave trader, and Mr. Nwanunobi and his male relatives think that their own failure to produce children, in a patrilineal society, is a result of their family\u2019s role in bringing other people\u2019s lineages to an end. \u201cI didn\u2019t think twice about believing it,\u201d Mr. Nwanunobi told me. He quoted a portion from the Book of Exodus, which refers to God \u201cvisiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children\u2026to the third and fourth generation.\u201d\n\nSimilar Bible passages have become popular in certain religious circles in Nigeria. The pastors encourage their congregations to identify patterns in their afflictions and to investigate their histories for root causes, then to ask God for forgiveness, usually after a period of fasting. In collaboration with his younger brother in England, Mr. Nwanunobi is now making arrangements for priests to visit the family and advise on what steps to take to free them from their past. \u201cIf not, the family will continue to go down,\u201d he said.\n\nMy own family held a similar intervention in January 2018, organized by my father, who, at 79, is the oldest male and head of the extended family. Members of the Nwaubani family in Nigeria and around the world participated in the three days of prayer and fasting. On the final day, a few dozen who lived nearby gathered in my father\u2019s home, then accompanied him to the local Anglican Church, where a priest invoked God\u2019s mercies on us. In December, my father organized another ceremony. Hundreds of family members who were home for the Christmas holidays joined in the thanksgiving service. This time, we dressed in our Sunday best and danced merrily to the altar to present a special money offering as a token of gratitude to God for granting us a new beginning.\n\nStill, my father does not believe that the descendants of those who took part in the slave trade should now pay for those wrongs. As he points out, buying and selling human beings had been part of many African cultures, as a form of serfdom, long before the first white people landed on our shores. And though many families still retain the respect and influence accrued by their slave-trading ancestors, the direct material gains have petered out over time. \u201cIf anyone asks me for reparations,\u201d he said sarcastically, \u201cI will tell them to follow me to my backyard so that I can pluck some money from the tree there and give it to them.\u201d\n\nMr. Chishimba takes a similar view. \u201cSlavery was wrong, but do I carry upon my shoulders the sins of my forefathers so that I should go around saying sorry? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said. Mr. Duke doesn\u2019t believe that Africans should play much of a part in the American reparations conversation, because the injustices the descendants of slaves suffer stem primarily from their maltreatment and deprivation in the U.S. \u201cThe Africans didn\u2019t see anything wrong with slavery,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if the white man wasn\u2019t there, they would still use these people as their domestics. However, because the white man was now involved and fortunes were being made\u2026that was when the criminality came in.\u201d\n\nMr. Nwanunobi wishes the matter were as straightforward as paying reparations in cash. He says that he would be willing to hand over all his family\u2019s land and houses to anyone that suffered from his grandfather\u2019s slave trading, whether in Nigeria or the U.S. \u201cI am happy to give anything as long as it would bring an end to this suffering,\u201d he said. \u201cI will do whatever it will take to appease anybody, if only I can identify the particular people we offended.\u201d\n\nAs for Mr. Rafiq, he agrees that Africans owe something to the descendants of slaves in America\u2014a forthright acknowledgment of their own complicity in the trans-Atlantic trade. \u201cEducated Africans need to rewrite their history, especially postcolonial history, which was a kind of restorative history that tended to marginalize issues like slavery,\u201d he said. \u201cPart of the compensation is telling the story of our part in what is happening to African-Americans today.\u201d\n\nMs. Nwaubani is a Nigerian writer and journalist.
