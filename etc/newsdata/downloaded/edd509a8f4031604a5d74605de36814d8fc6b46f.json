'The Supreme Court has upheld that principle time and time again.'\n\nLystad and the group believe hate speech should be denounced but don't believe censorship to be the solution.\n\n'Hate speech should be condemned, but legally, the answer to speech we don't like is more speech, not censorship,' he said. 'Our primary focus is education, and to help people better understand the First Amendment, free speech, free press, and why it's so vital to our democracy.'", "description": "The study, conducted by the Campaign for Free Speech, found that some 51 percent of Americans believe the amendment - adopted in 1791 - 'should be updated to reflect the cultural norms of today.'", "authors": ["Matthew Wright For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/14/20179282-0-image-a-6_1572010615504.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
