Reporting structures were also changed, Manik said.\n\nThe LBC, at its peak, accounted for 30% of the total annual revenue collection for SARS and was specifically focused on providing an \u201cend-to-end\u201d service for corporates - a one stop shop to resolve tax queries, VAT refunds and audits.\n\nUnder the restructuring undertaken by Moyane, at a cost of R300m \u2013 the LBC was essentially dissolved in 2016.\n\nConsultancy firm Bain and Company was hired to advise SARS on what its \"new\" operating model should be.\n\nThe role Bain played is likely to come under scrutiny, as former commissioner Pravin Gordhan also testified on Tuesday that he did not believe the restructuring was necessary.\n\nThese sentiments were shared by both Hore and Manik.\n\nManik told an altogether far more concerning story over the dismantling of the LBC \u2013 which has been described as the backbone of revenue collection agency - and how she was sidelined. She said the only good reason she could think of for breaking down the LBC, would be to reconstitute it in an even better format.\n\nThis never happened.\n\nWhen pushed by evidence leader adv. Carol Steinberg on her suspicions over why the LBC was broken down, in light of a lack of evidence, Manik said fraud could lie at the heart of it.\n\nRecent reports in the media have shown dubious VAT repayments to businesses owned by the Gupta family, for instance.\n\nIn May acting SARS commissioner Mark Kingon said in an interview with Business Day that he would not be reversing the new operating model implemented under Moyane \u2013 but it required a few \u201ctweaks\u201d in key areas to improve service delivery and revenue collection, particularly for large businesses.\n\nFor the past four years, SARS has fallen short of revenue collection targets with a cumulative shortfall of R100bn.\n\nFixing this would involve rebuilding relationships between SARS and big business.\n\nManik\u2019s departure from SARS was not amicable. She said she felt intimidated and scared, and even lodged a grievance with then finance minister Gordhan.\n\nProf. Michael Katz, a member of the panel under retired judge Robert Nugent, asked Manik if it could be determined, through looking at the data, if the dismantling of the LBC was a cause of the decline in revenue collection.\n\nManik said it would indeed be possible.\n\nBoth Manik and Hore were pushed to elaborate on a meeting in December 2014 when Moyane disbanded the executive committee of SARS \"after he read a report on the rogue unit in the Sunday Times,\" Hore said.\n\nThe theme of the disbanded exco was recurring and seems to be a key focus area of the commission.\n\nIn December 2014 Moyane dissolved the exco \u2013 three months after his appointment \u2013 without consultation, according to Hore.\n\n\u201cIf my recollection was correct, it was after one of the rogue unit reports he had read in the Sunday Times,\u201d Hore told the inquiry.\n\nHore left SARS shortly thereafter, under a cloud, following a verbal spat with a colleague. But allegations leaked into the media, which Hore maintains are not true.\n\nAs part of an agreement surrounding his departure, these perceptions in the public domain were supposed to have been corrected, but this, he told the inquiry, was never done.\n\nEarlier in the day the inquiry heard from other witnesses, who spoke of a culture of fear at the institution following Moyane\u2019s appointment.\n\nTshebeletso Seremane, the former group executive for integrity, also testified how she was sidelined after raising issues over the restructuring.\n\nOn Thursday, former enforcement executive Gene Ravele and former deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay are expected to give evidence\n\n* Sign up to Fin24's top news in your inbox: SUBSCRIBE TO FIN24 NEWSLETTER", "description": "The commission of inquiry into SARS hears how restructuring under Tom Moyane \u201cbroke\u201d the Large Business Centre and \"sidelined\" those seen as close to former leadership.", "authors": ["Kyle Cowan"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6814/7cf0f16c198440039a9c1d365c91c808.jpg", "published_at": "2018-06-27"}
