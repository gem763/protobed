Gluten is out and chicken is in today. Tomorrow, beef may be back and pasta may once again be nutritionally correct. And all of it will be served up via hype-hungry mass media, reported by people who know little about nutrition, much less the pleasures of the table.\n\nBee Wilson sifts through fad, fiction and fanciful half-truths in her search for common sense solutions to real food problems. It isn\u2019t always easy. Consider the case of nutritional epidemiologist Fumiaki Imamura, who, for 15 years, has been studying \u201coutlines of diet across whole populations to arrive at a more accurate account of how food and health are related.\u201d Ms. Wilson explains that Mr. Imamura\u2019s research \u201cshows that most countries in the world are currently eating more healthy food than we ever did but also more unhealthy food. Many of us have a split personality when it comes to food, but then that is hardly surprising given how schizophrenic our food supply has become. We have access to more fresh fruit nowadays than we ever did but also more sugar-sweetened cereals and french fries.\u201d\n\nOne result is a statistical fluke reflected in evaluations of global data by scientists like Mr. Imamura. The (statistically) \u201chighest-quality overall diets in the world are mostly to be found not in rich countries but in the continent of Africa, mostly in the less developed sub-Saharan regions,\u201d where \u201cnourishing grains such as sorghum, maize, millet, and teff are made into healthy main dishes.\u201d Thus the 10 countries with supposed \u201chealthiest diet patterns\u201d are: Chad, Mali, Cameroon, Guyana, Tunisia, Sierra Leone, Laos, Nigeria, Guatemala and French Guiana. By contrast, countries with \u201cthe least healthy diet patterns\u201d include some the world\u2019s most affluent.\n\nSub-Saharan Africa also \u201cdoes very well on the consumption of beans, pulses, and vegetables\u201d with the average Zimbabwean eating 17.3 ounces of vegetables a day, compared with just 2.3 ounces for the average Swiss. But, as Bee Wilson points out, \u201cZimbabweans may eat more vegetables than the Swiss, but there is more to health than vegetables, given that life expectancy in Zimbabwe in 2015 was just fifty-nine years of age compared with eighty-three for the average Swiss person.\u201d\n\nA happy medium of sorts seems to have been reached in prosperous South Korea where vegetable consumption has remained high \u2014 including very healthy fermented vegetable products like kimchi \u2014 in spite of consumer affluence and access to the dubious delights of \u201cmodern\u201d convenience foods.\n\nMeanwhile, back in the West, trendy faddists have actually been driving people away from many healthy traditional dishes. It\u2019s almost as if a conspiracy existed to make comfort food uncomfortable. A glaring example is gluten hysteria.\n\n\u201cOn the basis of such pseudoscience,\u201d Ms. Wilson writes, \u201cmillions of us have started to look with terror on a range of basic and nourishing foods, including pasta and noodles \u2026 gluten has come to be viewed as a pollutant \u2026 Only around 1 percent of the population actually suffers from celiac disease, an autoimmune disease in which the gut lining is damaged by gluten \u2026 A further small segment of the population may be suffering from a much milder \u2014 and still controversial \u2014 condition known as nonceliac gluten sensitivity, whose symptoms include brain fog, stomach pain, and bloating. But these two conditions cannot begin to explain why one hundred million Americans, or a third of the population, say (according to industry data) that they are now actively avoiding gluten.\u201d\n\nIt is sad, she concludes, that so many people \u201cshould have forced themselves to abandon once-beloved foods and buy expensive gluten-free replacements for no good reason, in the name of wellness.\u201d\n\nBee Wilson is not on a gluten-free diet, but she shows no signs of succumbing to \u201cbrain fog.\u201d She believes that what we eat should not only be healthy but also a source of spiritual nourishment. She knows the difference between mere food and a good meal, and she is a gallant foe of those who, in the name of \u201chealth,\u201d would render our daily bread joyless and soul-less.\n\n\u2022 Aram Bakshian Jr., a former aide to Presidents Nixon, Ford and Reagan, has written widely on politics, history, gastronomy and the arts.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nTHE WAY WE EAT NOW: HOW THE FOOD REVOLUTION HAS TRANSFORMED OUR LIVES, OUR BODIES, AND OUR WORLD\n\nBy Bee Wilson\n\nBasic Books, $30, 356 pages\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
