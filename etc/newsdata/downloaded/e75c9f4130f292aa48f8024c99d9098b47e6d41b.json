NFL scouts point to talent gap: 'Ohio State would definitely beat Clemson'", "language": "en", "text": "COLUMBUS, Ohio \u2013 Scouts from 14 NFL teams lined the sideline in pre-game on Saturday night here, clad in their slick windbreakers, custom coaching pants and logoed dry fits.\n\nThey came from every corner of the NFL universe to see Ohio State and Michigan State, with Miami\u2019s Chris Grier the only general manager of the bunch. The robust showing offered some clarity to the proceedings on the field, where Ohio State simultaneously sputtered through its first modest challenge of the season yet managed to dominate No. 25 Michigan State, 34-10.\n\nHow can you explain a team looking listless for parts of two quarters and still muddling its way to eventual dominance? Well, those scouts weren\u2019t in town to go to the Short North or see the Blue Jackets\u2019 blueliners. \u201cI\u2019ve seen both Ohio State and Clemson,\u201d a veteran scout told Yahoo Sports this week. \u201cOhio State would definitely beat Clemson.\u201d\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nWe\u2019ve crossed the threshold in the college football season where talent and performance need to cancel out the biases of expectations and brands. We\u2019ve hit the juncture where wins can be gauged against the opposition\u2019s performance in other games, and there\u2019s just enough flavor from conference play for identities to have formed.\n\nOhio State\u2019s aura of infallibility faded amid the brisk fall evening, as they\u2019d been ripping apart teams at an unsustainable clip. But considering Alabama\u2019s youth, Clemson\u2019s puzzling offensive struggles and the questions about Georgia\u2019s skill on the outside, it\u2019s not unreasonable to make an argument that the Buckeyes are the best team in the country. LSU fans could argue themselves in the conversation, Oklahoma has a prove-it game against Texas in Dallas next week and Wisconsin has the same here at the Horseshoe in three weeks.\n\nJ.K. Dobbins #2 of the Ohio State Buckeyes takes off on a 67-yard touchdown run in the second quarter of his team's win over the Michigan State Spartans. (Getty)\n\nStory continues\n\nBut halfway through Ryan Day\u2019s first season, the highest compliment to the re-jiggered staff, juiced-up defense and evolved offensive identity he\u2019s brought is that the Buckeyes are a heavy favorite to return to the College Football Playoff for the first time since the 2016 season.\n\nThe story of Day\u2019s 6-0 journey through the first half of the schedule begins with talent. This is a team that\u2019s flush on both sides of the ball, with defensive end Chase Young and cornerback Jeffrey Okudah projecting as top-10 NFL draft picks. (Defensive back Shaun Wade could join them in the first round if he keeps progressing). On offense, tailback J.K. Dobbins showcased his continued evolution on Saturday, rushing for 172 yards, including a 67-yard touchdown burst that Day termed a \"home run\" that \"really changed the game.\" Some of the credit needs to go to Urban Meyer and the robust recruiting operation that director of player personnel Mark Pantoni built under Meyer\u2019s watch. \u201cThis is the most talent that Ohio State has had since 2015,\u201d another NFL scout told Yahoo Sports. \u201cThey\u2019re talented, they\u2019re deep and they play really hard. This team is a monster.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s where the credit needs to be shifted to Day, as there are plenty of teams where the sum doesn\u2019t become greater than their parts. He\u2019s fast-forwarded the development of quarterback Justin Fields and overseen the resuscitation of a defense from historically bad to top five under new defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley. Perhaps more importantly, he\u2019s kept a program that spent 2018 ensconced in drama without a single tense moment on or off the field. The highest compliment to Day is that this Ohio State team has taken on his personality \u2013 focused, understated and highly competitive.\n\nIn a quiet moment as Saturday night merged into Sunday morning, Day went through the identity of his team through six games. And it turned out the identity is that there are a lot of identities.\n\nThe offense is diverse, as Day rattled off \u201cthe combination of run-pass 12 and 11 personnel, QB run, spread run, heavy run, play-action, dropback pass, there\u2019s a lot going on there with tempo.\u201d The defense can play both man and zone, and he lauded Drue Chrisman as perhaps the country\u2019s best punter (48.2 average on Saturday).\n\nDay gave the Michigan State gameball to old sage strength coach Mickey Marotti, Meyer\u2019s longtime wingman, for keeping the program\u2019s ethos of toughness. (Ohio State\u2019s defense held Michigan State to 285 yards total offense on 65 plays.)\n\n\u201cMy biggest thing coming in was, what was it going to look like when we faced some adversity, when it\u2019s hard,\u201d Day told Yahoo Sports. \u201cI thought we worked through that tonight. It wasn\u2019t clean. It\u2019s pretty exciting when it\u2019s not clean and you have the numbers that you have.\u201d\n\nHis recruiting chops have helped, including luring Fields on transfer and bringing in stud freshman receiver Garrett Wilson, as both have flashed the potential for gilded NFL futures of their own. (Day has also assembled the No. 4 class for 2020, again assuring the Buckeyes will have the most talent in the Big Ten.)\n\nBut what\u2019s emerged in this Ohio State season is a team that\u2019s playing as the best version of itself. It all starts with Fields, who looked limited in spots at Georgia, and his sporadic struggles in the spring in Columbus didn\u2019t portent inevitable success. But Day\u2019s offense, with the help of coordinator Mike Yurcich and assistant quarterback coach Corey Dennis, has turned Fields from a quarterback with an isolated run-first package at Georgia to one of the country\u2019s best.\n\nFields threw the first interception of his college career on Saturday night, but he\u2019s still got an 18-1 touchdown-to-interception ratio and finished 17-of-25 passing for 206 yards and two touchdowns. He\u2019s also rushed for eight touchdowns and has kept the quarterback run threat a lethal option in the Ohio State offense.\n\nChase Young #2 of the Ohio State Buckeyes rushes against the Michigan State Spartans on Saturday. (Getty)\n\nDay admitted that he\u2019s in a constant battle with himself over how much he should run Fields, as they are playing this season without a comparable available backup on the Buckeye roster.\n\n\u201cEvery second of my night,\u201d Day said when asked about how much he ponders the risk/reward of running Fields. \u201cThat's constant. And we called some [QB runs] when we needed them. When he needed to, he did a good job with his feet. He had 84 yards rushing [61 after accounting for sacks]. Those were big yards. The impact he can have is huge, as you can see.\u201d\n\nWhy has he developed so quickly when he looked limited at times at Georgia? Noted quarterback tutor Quincy Avery, who works with Fields, said that the quarterback reads in Ohio State\u2019s offense are pure progression reads that are simpler than the safety-based reads in Georgia\u2019s offense. Avery also works with Dwayne Haskins, the former Buckeye standout, and said that Day\u2019s offense is quarterback friendly in the way that \u201cit really ties your feet with your eyes to work the progressions.\u201d\n\nAvery adds: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of NFL teams that run the offense the same way as Ohio State. That ways guys are prepared for NFL, but also in position for success.\u201d\n\nThe progression of the defense has been even more distinct. Ohio State shut out Michigan State in the second half on Saturday night, forced three turnovers and looked every bit of the top-five defense the statistics say the Buckeyes are. (Ohio State\u2019s points per game on defense will actually be worse after giving up 10 tonight.)\n\n\u201cThey are playing a completely different scheme,\u201d said Lane Kiffin, who coached FAU against the Buckeyes in the opener. \u201cThere\u2019s much more of an NFL influence, with Cover 3 match-up. They really fixed what had been the issue.\u201d\n\nOn a Blackout night in Columbus, the Buckeyes sleepwalked their way to a blowout. They had enough adversity to at least be tested, and showed enough mettle and flashed enough talent where they stated a strong case for being considered the nation\u2019s best team.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Halfway through Ryan Day\u2019s first season, the Buckeyes appear to be a heavy favorite to return to the College Football Playoff for the first time since the 2016 season \u2014 and they just might be the best team in the country.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/qVEk0nehhz9ORtxvu4XZRg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6r7hv0ZHtS.DjX2R_HC.9A--~B/aD0yNDcyO3c9MzcwNztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/8e0a4bf0-e7e4-11e9-9b7d-ac494e2ce382", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
