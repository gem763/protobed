He has been held by immigration officials since he completed his 41-month prison term last March after pleading guilty to multiple charges of fraud in 2014.\n\nA judge ruled in October 2018 that he would be deported upon completion of his prison sentence.\n\nHe was detained to \"a facility in western Pennsylvania which houses immigration detainees,\" their family lawyer, James J. Leonard Jr., told Entertainment Tonight.\n\nJoe has said he came to the U.S. as an infant and wasn't aware he wasn't an American citizen.\n\nHowever, according to U.S. law, even though Joe has lived in America since he was an infant, he never became a legal U.S. citizen and immigrants may be deported if they are convicted of \"a crime of moral turpitude\" or an \"aggravated felony.\"\n\nLeonard told Fox News in a statement last Friday: \"Our system of justice has failed this family. These draconian immigration laws are destroying families, and the time for serious immigration reform is here. It\u2019s absolutely gut-wrenching what is happening. Our country is so much better than this.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhile Teresa has stood by her husband publically, she has also expressed doubt about their marriage if he is deported.
