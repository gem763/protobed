He was 95 years old.\n\nZimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa, the former deputy who toppled him, confirmed Mr. Mugabe\u2019s death in a message from his official Twitter account Friday. \u201cCde Mugabe was an icon of liberation, a pan-Africanist who dedicated his life to the emancipation and empowerment of his people,\u201d Mr. Mnangagwa said. \u201cHis contribution to the history of our nation will never be forgotten.\u201d\n\nOn the streets of Zimbabwe\u2019s capital Harare, the former strongman\u2019s death was received in quiet, with small groups of people gathering to discuss the news on their way to a monthly, government-mandated cleaning campaign. Their silence stood in contrast with the jubilation that greeted Mr. Mugabe\u2019s ouster in November 2017.\n\nFor most Zimbabweans, the end of the Mugabe era hasn\u2019t brought the change they once expected. The country\u2019s official annual inflation rate spiked once again in June, to 176%, with many economists estimating that real price increases for consumers are closer to 600%. In recent weeks, there have been brutal crackdowns on protesters, opposition activists and other government critics.\n\n\u201cThe author of our problems is dead,\u201d said Tinotenda, a 22-year-old student who declined to give his last name. \u201cI am in college now, but I don\u2019t know whether or not I will get a job. Mugabe got us where we are now.\u201d\n\nMr. Mugabe\u2019s topsy-turvy rule became the narrative of Zimbabwe\u2019s independence story. In 1980, he was elected prime minister of the newly independent nation and initially went to great lengths to cultivate goodwill among white people. He would frequently invite Ian Smith, the erstwhile leader of the white-minority government that ran the country then known as Rhodesia, to tea. The former colony had detached itself from the British Empire 15 years earlier, but many white settlers retained deep ties to Britain.\n\nWhen his Zanu-PF party lost control of Parliament in 2000, in part because white farmers had swung their support behind a rival, Mr. Mugabe felt betrayed. In keeping with a pattern that would define his long political career, he moved to neutralize his opponents, giving the green light for veterans of Zimbabwe\u2019s liberation war to invade white-owned farms.\n\nRobert Mugabe in Libya in 2010.

Thousands of Zimbabwe\u2019s black professionals followed, many crossing the border to South Africa in search of work. Elections in 2002 and 2008 turned violent. Inflation spun out of control and the country began to import a main food staple\u2014maize\u2014to stave off hunger. As hunger and poverty spread, the man who came to power as a new African democrat ended up as another African despot.\n\nIt was an ailing Mr. Mugabe\u2019s failure to control an intensifying succession battle that ended his reign. On the evening of Nov. 14, 2017, tanks and soldiers directed by Mr. Mnangagwa, whom Mr. Mugabe had purged as vice president days earlier, moved into the capital, Harare. Locked in his opulent \u201cBlue Roof\u201d mansion on the outskirts of the city, Mr. Mugabe watched his hold over the country and party evaporate within days.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Zimbabweans took to the streets to celebrate his impending departure. He resigned from the presidency on Nov. 21, 2017, as his Zanu-PF colleagues were preparing to impeach him.\n\nMr. Mugabe didn\u2019t cease to chide his opponents, even in retirement. In one of his final public appearances, on the eve of 2018 elections that were eventually won by Mr. Mnangagwa, a frail and at times disoriented Mr. Mugabe endorsed the opposition over the party he had led for much of his life.\n\n\u201cI cannot vote for those who have tormented me,\u201d he said, slouched behind a pile of microphones at his Harare mansion. \u201cPray that tomorrow brings us good news.\u201d\n\nRobert Gabriel Mugabe was born in Matibiri village on Feb. 21, 1924, the son of a carpenter father who later abandoned his young family, in a country that was then a British colony known as Southern Rhodesia. He was educated at Jesuit schools and studied at the University of Fort Hare in South Africa, where he was introduced to Marx and Gandhi\u2014egalitarian thinkers who inspired his opposition to white minority rule.\n\nThe bookish Mr. Mugabe went on to become a schoolteacher in Ghana, where he met his first wife, Sally, also a teacher, who would turn\u2014like her husband\u2014to political activism. She died in 1992.\n\nIn 1960, Mr. Mugabe returned home to join a liberation movement that evolved in 1972 into a guerrilla war against white leadership. Rhodesian authorities arrested him in 1963, after linking his party, Zimbabwe African National Union, or ZANU, to the murder of a farmhand. Colonial authorities banned ZANU and locked up its leader.\n\nMr. Mugabe used the jail time to devour books on law and economics. In 1966, when his young son died, his jailers denied him permission to attend the funeral. Friends say Mr. Mugabe never forgave the Rhodesian government.\n\nHe emerged from 11 years of prison, writes Martin Meredith, author of \u201cMugabe: Power, Plunder and the Struggle for Zimbabwe\u2019s Future,\u201d even more committed to overturning white domination, his genteel manner disguising \u201ca hardened and single-minded ambition.\u201d\n\nRobert Mugabe, center, is flanked by vice presidents Phelekezela Mphoko, right, and Emmerson Mnangagwa at State House in Harare in late 2014.

Rhodesian government troops lashed back, and as many as 30,000 people died before independence in 1980. Elections then propelled Mr. Mugabe to power.\n\nAt first, he won over many of his critics\u2014including Mr. Smith\u2014with pledges of racial reconciliation. The British knighted Mr. Mugabe in 1994. He persuaded many white settlers to stay in a country where they remained a tiny minority\u201422 blacks to every white\u2014but no longer exercised the levers of political power.\n\nYet in other ways, Mr. Mugabe remained a guerrilla fighter. In the 1980s, at a time when the world hailed him as a peacemaker, he allowed a North Korean-trained military brigade to kill thousands of people in the Western Matabeleland region, a stronghold of his old political partner and sometime-foe Joshua Nkomo.\n\nMr. Mugabe later expressed regret for the slaughter, describing it as a dark period, but he continued to cow opponents with a mix of violence and politics that doomed Zimbabwe\u2019s economy, prompting a flight of skilled workers and private capital.\n\nHe supported forcible seizures of farmland belonging to whites, a violent and chaotic process that triggered Western sanctions and started Zimbabwe\u2019s steep economic descent. The land often ended up in the hands of Mr. Mugabe\u2019s political allies, rather than those of poor black farmers.\n\nLong lines formed outside stores and shelves emptied. Between 2000 and 2008, Zimbabwe\u2019s economy contracted by nearly half; by the end of 2008, inflation had peaked at 500 billion percent, according to the International Monetary Fund. Toward the end of what became known as the \u201cLost Decade,\u201d the price of a loaf of bread soared to 80 trillion Zimbabwean dollars.\n\nWestern humanitarian aid and the adoption of the U.S. dollar helped avert a total collapse of the economy, but Mr. Mugabe became bitterly anti-West after the U.S. and the European Union imposed sanctions on him and his loyalists for human-rights abuses and undermining his country\u2019s democracy.\n\nMr. Mugabe could be urbane and witty, but also calculating and coldblooded. Longtime opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai once described a dinner meeting that captured those paradoxical personal qualities.\n\n\u201cCan we eat?\u201d Mr. Mugabe asked.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Mr. Tsvangirai replied. \u201cI\u2019ve already had something.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Zimbabwe\u2019s president implored, Mr. Tsvangirai recalled. \u201cIf you don\u2019t eat with me, they will say it\u2019s because Robert Mugabe kills people.\u201d\n\nMr. Tsvangirai laughed, and sat down.\n\nThroughout his presidency, Mr. Mugabe refused to groom a successor, frequently dismissing allies he feared were becoming too powerful. Yet his final spin on the carousel proved one too many.\n\nIn November 2017, Mr. Mugabe installed his second wife, Grace, a former typist nearly four decades his junior, as his vice president, ousting Mr. Mnangagwa, a longtime ally who had been nicknamed \u201cThe Crocodile\u201d for his political ruthlessness. Dubbed \u201cthe First Shopper of Zimbabwe\u201d and \u201cdis-Grace\u201d for embarking on extravagant retail expeditions to Asia, Mrs. Mugabe had a long list of enemies in the Zanu-PF party, who soon plotted to remove her from the line of succession.\n\nFrom temporary exile in South Africa, Mr. Mnangagwa worked with the head of Zimbabwe\u2019s armed forces, Constantino Chiwenga, to direct soldiers to take over Harare. Mr. Mugabe woke up in his \u201cBlue Roof\u201d mansion to find himself under house arrest, shut in by the security forces that had so long propped up his rule.\n\nBut the \u201cOld Man,\u201d as he had come to be known, clung on to power for nearly a week. In a televised address at which he was widely expected to formalize his exit, Mr. Mugabe, flanked by the generals who turned against him, insisted he was still commander in chief.\n\n\u201cYou and I have work to do,\u201d Mr. Mugabe said in a rambling speech two days before stepping down from the presidency. \u201cGoodnight.\u201d\n\nHe is survived by his second wife, Grace, and their three children, Bona, Robert Jr. and Chatunga.\n\nWrite to Peter Wonacott at peter.wonacott@wsj.com and Gabriele Steinhauser at gabriele.steinhauser@wsj.com", "description": "Robert Mugabe, a schoolteacher-turned-guerrilla fighter who helped topple white colonial rule in Zimbabwe only to lead the country to the brink of economic ruin, died at 95.", "authors": ["Peter Wonacott", "Gabriele Steinhauser", "Peter.Wonacott Wsj.Com", "Gabriele.Steinhauser Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104556/social", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
