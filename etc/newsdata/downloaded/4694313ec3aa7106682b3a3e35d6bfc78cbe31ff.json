Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected 215,000 claims.\n\n--The four-week moving average of claims, which smoothes out volatility in the weekly data, was 214,750. That was up slightly from the previous week's 213,750 average.\n\n--Claims for the week ended Oct. 5 were unrevised from an initially reported 210,000.\n\n-Continuing claims, those filed by workers unemployed for longer than a week, fell by 10,000 to 1.68 million in the week ending Oct. 5.\n\nThe Labor Department report on jobless claims can be accessed at: https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf\n\nWrite to Kate Davidson at kate.davidson@wsj.com and Harriet Torry at harriet.torry@wsj.com.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 17, 2019 08:45 ET (12:45 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
