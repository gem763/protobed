They're an extension of a bigger piece that also has the same soft and velvet looking surface. (Sofia Rodriguez/CBC)\n\n\"I was surprised with the difference between [Dublin] and London in the amount of interest ceramic has here,\" she said.\n\n\"The LCAC make it so easy to access and it helps educate a lot of people. Back home, there weren't that may places where you could just come in for a couple of hours to spin the wheel, so it's really great to see that here.\"\n\nShe adds that peoples' love for this kind of art really makes it special.\n\n\"Handmade things have more meaning. People love them more because they know someone put their blood, sweat and tears.\"\n\nStirbyte says these are part of her wall-hanging beetle collection. They're all made of porcelain with hand painted details. (Sofia Rodriguez/CBC)\n\nStirbyte makes sculptural ceramic pieces that are based on things found in nature.\n\n\"I've always been fascinated with little things that go by unseen or unnoticed as we go about our very busy lives. That's the stuff I like to highlight,\" she said.\n\nLately, she's been particularly inspired by deep-sea creatures and insects.\n\n\"I end up combining all the different elements and turn them into a brand new life form of strange and unusual creatures that don't exist in our world.\"\n\nThis weekend, Stirbyte, along with other artists from LCAC, will be showing off their work at the Fusion Clay and Glass Show in Toronto.", "description": "The London Clay Art Centre is celebrating it's 10 year anniversary.
