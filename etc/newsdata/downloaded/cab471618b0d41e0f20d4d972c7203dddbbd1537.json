Adam Kinzinger, a high-profile Republican critic of the president, said on Face the Nation Sunday. \u201cThe message this is sending to our allies around the world I think is really going to be bad.\u201d\u2026\n\nTrump responded with a rant about how Graham wants troops to stay in the Middle East \u201cfor the next thousand years\u201d and implied a potential threat to Graham\u2019s reelection next year if he continues fighting the president on the issue. Trump said Graham should focus on judicial issues \u2014 including investigating former president Barack Obama, former FBI director James Comey, and several other of Trump\u2019s frequent punching bags \u2014 because his constituents in South Carolina want American troops brought home.\n\nWhen reporters read these comments to Graham, he insisted that Trump\u2019s moves will be a disaster. \u201cThe president\u2019s decision here I think is the biggest mistake of his presidency. And I will not ever be quiet about matters of national security,\u201d he said. He later added, \u201cI think this is a mistake worse than what Obama did\u201d in withdrawing from Iraq.", "description": "", "authors": ["Buzzfeednews.Com Article Addybaird Trump-Republicans-Impeachment-Inquiry-Syria-Turkey"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
