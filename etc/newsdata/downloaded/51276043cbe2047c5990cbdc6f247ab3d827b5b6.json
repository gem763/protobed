Those included in the study were, on average, roughly 44 years of age, and approximately two thirds were either overweight or obese, based on body mass index.\n\nOverall, more than 12 percent of the adults studied had moderate to severe tooth wear, with an average of 3.4 tooth surfaces affected. In those who regularly drank soda and other soft drinks, the number of teeth affected by wear was 1.4 times higher per sugary beverage consumed per day. Conversely, consumption of unsweetened, non-carbonated drinks seemed to reduce levels of moderate-to-severe tooth wear, the authors reported.\n\n\u201c[As] dentists\u2026 we should be asking our patients who are obese and/or have tooth wear what calories they are drinking,\u201d O\u2019Toole noted. \u201cI think the message\u2026 is to limit acidic drinks. We don\u2019t have any evidence to suggest that the occasional drink will cause harm.\u201d", "description": "Oct. 28 (UPI) \u2014 If you\u2019re looking to lose weight and improve the health of your teeth, limiting your intake of soda and other sugary soft", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
