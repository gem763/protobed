But that\u2019s not ridicule, you say? Well, that\u2019s the point: Who should be trusted to decide such things when fines, jail time and expulsion from college loom as possible consequences?\n\nSecond, federal courts consistently have struck down speech codes at public universities that punished students who engaged in undefined \u201cacts of intolerance\u201d or who \u201cstigmatized\u201d others based on their race, religion, sexuality or other characteristic. One such decision invalidated a university speech code that imposed discipline for \u201cthreats, insults, epithets, ridicule or personal attacks.\u201d\n\nThe reasoning in those cases \u2014 that speech may not be censored or punished for its content \u2014 also applies in the University of Connecticut case. Here, there was not even an identifiable target of the offensive speech, just a bystander with a cellphone. (Moreover, it appears that the Connecticut law, which was enacted a century ago, was intended to apply only to some form of \u201cadvertisement,\u201d making the use of the law to criminalize the students\u2019 speech even more misguided.)\n\nTo be sure, speech may be punished when the words used are likely to produce what the Supreme Court has called \u201cimminent lawless action,\u201d such as physical violence. But this leads to the third reason Connecticut\u2019s anti-ridicule statute is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court case that established that rule, Brandenburg v. Ohio in 1969, involved the prosecution of Ku Klux Klansmen who were filmed uttering repulsive racist statements \u2014 including the N-word. But as in the case of the University of Connecticut students, the Klansmen\u2019s words provoked no action, and the Ohio law under which the men were prosecuted was struck down under the First Amendment.\n\nIn the face of an absurd statute like Connecticut\u2019s anti-ridicule law, it is tempting to extol the value of satire, irreverence and cheek as part of our country\u2019s robust free-speech traditions. But this is not the time for that. Racial, ethnic, sexual and religious slurs exact a social cost. They deprive members of the affected groups of their dignity and inhibit their participation in our democracy as equal citizens.\n\nBut it is possible to hold that thought in mind while keeping in mind another thought: that we do not want the police or prosecutors \u2014 or university administrators, who too often cave in to public pressure in such situations \u2014 wielding the power to decide what constitutes \u201cridicule\u201d and when someone should be hauled up on charges for engaging in it.\n\nSteve Sanders (@SteveSSanders) is a professor at the Maurer School of Law at Indiana University.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
