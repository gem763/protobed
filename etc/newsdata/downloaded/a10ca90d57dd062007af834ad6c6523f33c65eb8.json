This war between secular and liturgical music, between soul and gospel, raged in Green throughout his early-\u201970s hot streak, where romantic fare like \u201cCall Me\u201d and \u201cTired of Being Alone\u201d was balanced out by religious favorites and faithful originals like \u201cGod Is Standing By\u201d and \u201cJesus Is Waiting.\u201d The scales tipped in 1974, when Green\u2019s sometime girlfriend, Mary Woodson, scorned by his refusal to get married, doused him in boiling grits in the bath, and shot herself. By 1976, Green had renounced secular music and become pastor of a Memphis Baptist church. The gospel records bricked on the charts (perhaps unfairly, considering the unbridled fire of performances captured in the 1984 documentary The Gospel According to Al Green), and Green returned to secular music in the \u201990s and aughts, but he never left the church.\n\nBob Dylan had a silver cross thrown his way by a fan at a San Diego gig late in his lengthy 1978 world tour, a comeback of sorts after the whimsical Rolling Thunder Revue excursion. Instinctively, he picked it up. Ill in Arizona the next day, he put the cross around his neck. Things got mystical from there. Dylan says an apparition appeared to him in the night. \u201cThere was a presence in the room that couldn\u2019t have been anybody but Jesus,\u201d he told the Washington Post in 1980. His next three albums \u2014 1979\u2019s Slow Train Coming, 1980\u2019s Saved, and 1981\u2019s Shot of Love \u2014 explored spiritual themes and Christian eschatology, to what critics considered to be diminishing returns. Dylan\u2019s abrupt gospel detour broke his lengthy streak of gold- and platinum-selling studio albums and incurred the wrath of admirers like John Lennon, who, in the last months of his life, rebuffed Slow Train Coming\u2019s \u201cGotta Serve Somebody\u201d with the caustic answer song \u201cServe Yourself.\u201d Dylan wouldn\u2019t see another platinum album until 1997\u2019s Time Out of Mind.\n\nThere comes a time, when musicians devote themselves to big questions, where the biggest question of them all comes calling, the question of what, if anything, orders the universe. Sometimes, mercurial ones whose work views the world and its processes from a bird\u2019s-eye view see purpose and intent behind the rhythm and balance of human life. Some take to calling that intent \u201cGod.\u201d Inquisitive ones might go long, poring over readings as one might sponge up culture in a trip to another country, as Dylan did in an intensive three-month Bible-study course in the late \u201970s, as Kanye West has this year, meeting with pastor Adam Tyson of Santa Clarita\u2019s Placerita Bible Church on Tuesdays to flesh out questions of faith that have informed his art since \u201cJesus Walks.\u201d \u201cI was being convicted that I was running away from God,\u201d Tyson recalled West saying, interviewed on the Pure Flix podcast this fall, \u201cand I knew I needed to make things right, so I came to Christ.\u201d West\u2019s new album and Imax short film Jesus Is King turn sharply away from the druggy, horny moods of The Life of Pablo and Ye, but can music\u2019s biggest ego be tamed?\n\nKing\u2019s \u201cFollow God,\u201d built on a sample of Whole Truth\u2019s 1974 Christian soul nugget \u201cCan You Lose by Following God,\u201d suggests that Kanye will always be provocative and difficult, nestling a casual boast \u2014 \u201cI was looking at the Gram, and I don\u2019t even like likes\u201d \u2014 in the middle of a verse about the hard work that goes into being less hardheaded. (In an interview promoting the new album, Kanye told Zane Lowe he is the \u201cgreatest artist in human existence\u201d and complained about flak for his recent political affiliations with Atlanta radio personality Big Boy. More on that in a bit.) \u201cFollow God\u201d feels like a bridge out of the breakneck oversharing of Ye\u2019s \u201cYikes\u201d and Pablo\u2019s \u201cNo More Parties in LA.\u201d The new album splits the difference between rousing choir exercises, Christian trap tunes, and holy chipmunk soul workouts that call back to College Dropout, an album that sampled the old spiritual \u201cI Want Jesus to Walk With Me\u201d and covered the 1929 hymn \u201cI\u2019ll Fly Away.\u201d In that sense, Jesus Is King is the man coming full circle.\n\nKanye West\u2019s present rejection of secular music is bound to divide the fandom. People who have come to his music in the past to bask in honesty, affluence, and arrogance won\u2019t find as much of that among the liturgical verses and choruses here. When the old Kanye does show face, it\u2019s to grouse about criticism from inside the church (\u201cWhat have you been hearing from the Christians? / They\u2019ll be the first ones to judge me\u201d) or else to flex on people who don\u2019t support the new direction (\u201cSwitch my, switch my attitude / I\u2019m so, I\u2019m so radical\u201d). These moments bear out the newness of the enterprise. Gospel is a music of the overwhelmed, the weary. Songwriting titan Thomas A. Dorsey wrote the classic \u201cTake My Hand, Precious Lord\u201d having just received news that his wife and infant son passed away in childbirth. The standards of the form \u2014 \u201cRough Side of the Mountain,\u201d \u201cMary Don\u2019t You Weep,\u201d \u201cWhy We Sing,\u201d \u201cNever Would Have Made It,\u201d \u201cTake Me to the King\u201d \u2014 are songs of black perseverance. This energy comes and goes on Jesus Is King. West opens \u201cOn God\u201d with encouragement for single mothers and incarcerated men but descends precipitously into listing off personal achievements. The message is immediately lost (unless the message is the prosperity gospel, which would explain why Joel Osteen is circling Kanye this month).\n\nThe writing here is about on par with what West achieved last year with Ye, as far as the ratio of quality to cringe apparent in the lyrics. The hook to \u201cClosed on Sunday\u201d \u2014 \u201cYou\u2019re my Chick-fil-A\u201d \u2014 gives a serious message about the downside to fame an undeserved silliness. \u201cEverything We Need\u201d detours into corn in verse two: \u201cWhat if Eve made apple juice / You gon\u2019 do what Adam do?\u201d When Kanye avoids his worst impulses, these songs get compelling. \u201cUse This Gospel\u201d achieves it by slotting him in between verses from the reunited Clipse, whose story of narrowly missing Fed time is the kind of miraculous testimony this album could use more of. \u201cHands On\u201d tells a horror story in four lines: \u201cCut out all the lights, He the light / Got pulled over, see the brights / \u2018What you doing on the street at night?\u2019 / Wonder if they gonna read your rights.\u201d Like the bright spots in West\u2019s back catalogue, \u201cHands On\u201d uses hip-hop as a bully pulpit to deliver a word about American injustice. A few more cuts like these might\u2019ve helped reconnect the artist with the abrasive radicalism of his music before Yeezus, Pablo, and Ye, Kanye\u2019s \u201cMe\u201d trilogy.\n\nJesus Is King\u2019s secret weapon is one Kanye has employed before in songs like \u201cTwo Words,\u201d \u201cBring Me Down,\u201d and \u201cUltralight Beam.\u201d He can wield a chorus of voices like a sword of fire. \u201cEvery Hour\u201d opens the album in the middle of a brilliant choral exercise by West\u2019s Sunday Service Choir. They lift the invocation \u201cSelah\u201d into the stratosphere on a booming \u201cHallelujah\u201d chorus. \u201cEverything We Need\u201d adds Ty Dolla $ign, who delivers a hair-raisingly good lyric about a passing night storm, bouncing silky harmonies off himself. \u201cWater\u201d sends voices careening around the mix like a school of fish. Kanye, who excels by slotting friends with varied skill sets into teams greater than the sum of their parts, is uplifted by singers hitting the notes he can\u2019t. (That said, \u201cGod Is,\u201d where West shreds his voice singing joyously over a towering sample of King of Gospel James Cleveland\u2019s Southern California Community Choir, is proof there\u2019s passion in this change of heart. The triumphant vocal feels like a photo negative of the self-excoriation of \u201cRunaway.\u201d)\n\nThe Sunday Service Choir takes center stage in Jesus Is King\u2019s Imax film, a half-hour performance inside Roden Crater, James Turrell\u2019s Arizona observatory and art installation. In the crater, the choir revisits exercises performed on tour with Kanye since the Sunday Service group debuted at Coachella. They\u2019re airtight and spirited, as they\u2019ve been in pop-up performances at churches across the country, and they keep those gigs\u2019 taste for hokey Christian trap covers at a minimum. In this cycle\u2019s most notable act of humility, Kanye plays a fly on the wall in most of these scenes, until the end, where he sings a revamped version of 808s & Heartbreak\u2019s \u201cStreet Lights\u201d dramatically as dusk draws in, and sings a bit of \u201cUse This Gospel\u201d to Psalm West for the touching conclusion. The crater is both a wise and an odd place to think to shoot a gospel movie. The acoustics are incredible, but the placid, eerie quiet of the crater, accentuated by the use of the circular frame the Coachella performance was shot through, is tough to shake.\n\nGospel is communicative music. Testimony is shared. Audience and performer have a rapport; they stew and stir each other til the room bubbles over. You can see it happen in the selections at any church service. You can watch it in any of the classic gospel documentaries. (See Aretha Franklin and Sydney Pollack\u2019s Amazing Grace, Al Green\u2019s aforementioned The Gospel According To \u2026, George Nierenberg\u2019s Say Amen, Somebody, and the \u201980s concert package Gospel and its sister film Oh Happy Day!) The air of exclusivity in staging a praise service at a remote location matches the invite-only nature of the early Sunday Service events. Kanye approaching spirituality the way he does his sneakers and clothing lines runs the risk of the streetwear-ification of the faith. As is the case with West\u2019s apparel, some fans came out of the Imax experience complaining that the price point is too high. The line in \u201cOn God\u201d where he tries to sanctify a reference to his own merch \u2014 \u201cOff the 350s, He supplied\u201d \u2014 ain\u2019t, as Twitter folk say, it.\n\nThis all could\u2019ve gone over catastrophically poorly (and there is still the chance that the box office and streaming numbers will reflect an audience not fully willing to follow Kanye West into his Christian era). The finished product feels equal parts polished and rushed, especially if you\u2019ve heard the leaks for the abandoned Yandhi album. Jesus Is King\u2019s Clipse reunion and Kenny G collaboration \u201cUse This Gospel\u201d originally contained Grand Theft Auto references and lines about money and time being fake. \u201cEverything We Need\u201d was home to a verse full of threats from the late XXXTentacion. In a recent interview with The Shade Room, Nicki Minaj let slip how abrupt and taxing this change of concepts has been, saying she wrote three different verses for the snide Yandhi track \u201cNew Body\u201d \u2014 which, if snippets are to be trusted, was in store for a coat of Christ-like paint after scrubbing vocals from Tekashi 6ix9ine \u2014 only to see the song get shelved. At 11 songs in 27 minutes, Jesus Is King feels even choppier than Ye, though it houses better beats and less embarrassing lyrics. The temptation to call it a serviceable Christian trap project and a necessary step back from the brink of destruction hinted at in songs like \u201cYikes\u201d is strong, but the (orange) elephant in the room and the gaping hole in the logic animating this project deserve mention.\n\nLike many affluent Evangelicals, Kanye fails to see the glaring flaw in casting in his lot with the American president, separator of families and divider of peoples, how a message of love is tainted by silence in the face of real cruelty. West positions himself as an advocate for prison reform while supporting a regime that\u2019s caging immigrants at the border and denying them due process. He stuck his neck out speaking up for LGBTQ hip-hop fans in 2005, but now he\u2019s petulant about the blowback for his Chick-fil-A shoutout (as if dispensing common sense in an interview once shores you against all future criticism), and making nice with Jerry Falwell Jr., president of the Virginia Christian school Liberty University, which has been in hot water under three different presidential administrations for poor treatment of LGBTQ students. The music of Jesus Is King is pretty, and the message is mostly positive. But unless this organization distinguishes itself from the divisive ideologies of political figures angling to jack into the considerable cultural cachet of Kanye West and his star-studded expanse of collaborators, it runs the risk of playing Hillsong to hip-hop. Does Kanye fix up and change course, or does he tarry awhile, like Dylan and Al Green, bleeding public interest until he sorts out the balance? Three years into his red-hat era, there\u2019s no end on the horizon.", "description": "\u2019Jesus Is King\u2019 splits the difference between rousing choir exercises, Christian trap tunes, and holy chipmunk soul workouts that call back to \u2018College Dropout.\u2019 In that sense, Jesus Is King is the man coming full circle.", "authors": ["Craig Jenkins"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/25/kanye-west/kanye-2.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
