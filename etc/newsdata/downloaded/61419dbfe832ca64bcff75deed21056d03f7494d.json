It was named as firm of the year at the annual Australian Investment Council awards last month and won the best small cap investment for its stake in dips and hummus maker Yumi's Quality Foods.\n\nAnacacia, which is perhaps best known for its early backing of $2.7 billion technology company Appen, was founded in 2007 by Jeremy Samuel and invests in listed and unlisted companies, typically with annual revenue worth $20 million to $200 million and at least $5 million profit.", "description": "Australian private equity firm Anacacia Capital is seeking a slice of the $288 billion infrastructure pipeline.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_3.5476%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/309245e89da1fbff2a69f363362a486773247038", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
