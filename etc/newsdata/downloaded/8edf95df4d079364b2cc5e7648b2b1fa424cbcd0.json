So far the state has released seven of the ship\u2019s crew, with a further 16 still left aboard.\n\nAnd on Saturday the Iranian coast guard seized a vessel carrying 284,000 litres of diesel for allegedly smuggling fuel in the Gulf, detaining 12 crew members from the Philippines in the process.\n\nThe nation has been fighting rampant smuggling heightened by the decline of the Iranian Rial and the low price of fuel brought about by heavy state subsidies introduced to keep the nation competitive amidst international pressure.", "description": "An Iranian tanker that sparked a diplomatic standoff between Tehran and western states has been spotted off the coast of Syria\u00a0according to US officials \u2013 despite assurances the vessel would not deliver its 2.1 million barrels of crude oil to the country.", "authors": ["Vincent Wood"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/07/10/iran-tanker-tartus.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
