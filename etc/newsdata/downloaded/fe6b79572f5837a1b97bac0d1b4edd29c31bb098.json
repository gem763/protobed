He raised about $18 million in each of the first two quarters of the year.\n\nSanders' aides said that the second best fundraising day of the year was Monday, when Sanders announced a plan to tax high-earning CEOs in an effort to reduce the widening gap between the nation's rich and poor.\n\nThough Shakir did not mention his rival by name, his statement could be interpreted as a reference in part to Warren, who said that she would not participate in big-money fundraisers in the primary but would not unilaterally disarm against President Donald Trump in a general election. Sanders has sworn off high-dollar fundraisers for the entire campaign.\n\nSanders' team said he also transferred an extra $2.6 million from his other campaign accounts, but that figure is not included in the his reported haul of $25.3 million.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/3a/56/3c2d90084ef394ef6f89088f106b/191001-bernie-sanders-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
