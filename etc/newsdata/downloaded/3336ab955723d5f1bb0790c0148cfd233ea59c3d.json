However, episode five (of 11) feels like a step backward, and not just because, for the first time, there\u2019s no update on what 2054-era Joanie Lockhart is up to.\n\nInstead, Sierra gets her own long point-of-view section (another first-timer this season, following Janelle and Whitney\u2019s individual segments). This feels like a wise choice on some level, as she\u2019s a character who has always \u2014 as seen through the eyes of others \u2014 lacked a degree of depth, and is easily judged for her wealth, hippie-ish beliefs, or loose sexuality. Time is running out for us to get to know her better. However, this episode\u2019s primary insights into her life include the reveal that, like everyone else on this show, she is prone to making terrible decisions.\n\nWell, also, there\u2019s this: While she was initially introduced in season four as the jobless daughter of a famous movie star, Sierra is now pursuing acting \u2014 and leaves her crying baby in the car when she goes into a casting office for a big audition. Sierra gets doubly lucky here: No one at the studio notices the infant in her back seat, and while she initially thinks she blew the audition, she later finds out she got the job.\n\nBecause this show is at times lacking subtlety, Sierra is cast as the titular Madame Bovary in a new film adaptation by hot new director Leif Devlin, winning the role after doing a scene in which Bovary, an unhappy mother, literally pushes her child away. A little more subtle, though, is the question of whether Sierra, in playing the part, is channeling her ambivalence toward motherhood or her feelings toward her own mother, who is finally introduced here. (Played by Jennifer Jason Leigh! One of the greats!)\n\nAdeline pops by to finally meet her grandson and give Sierra some acting advice, saying things like, \u201cThis little daughter is like an albatross around her neck,\u201d because again, subtlety is not always this show\u2019s primary concern. The Affair has a track record of showcasing terrible mothers, but it is impressive how many different types of passive aggression the writers are able to build into these characters, ensuring that Vik\u2019s mom and Helen\u2019s mom and Sierra\u2019s mom are all harsh in their own unique ways.\n\nThe next day, Sierra struggles with her scene on set but eventually manages to nail it, going out afterward to celebrate with the director \u2014 which leads to some fun with cocaine and bathroom-stall sex. (Sleeping with your director: better or worse than sleeping with your dying next-door neighbor? Either way, not a great idea.)\n\nWhen she arrives late at the Solloway house, having left Eddie with 12-year-old Stacey as a babysitter, she has to face Helen\u2019s disapproval, as well as Eddie\u2019s continued tears \u2026 which leads to one of the show\u2019s most emotionally stressful sequences of all time, as Sierra, probably still a little high, takes Eddie for \u201ca quick little drive around the block.\u201d The ride devolves into a frantic spin through the Hollywood hills, ending with Sierra slamming her Range Rover into a dumpster. Eddie appears to be okay, but the car looks bad and Sierra looks worse. Just utterly broken.\n\nIt\u2019s a little hard to figure out how to feel about Sierra at this stage, because the show does do a thorough job of setting up just how tough this experience has been for her \u2014 new motherhood is a massive trial, especially when the father is no longer in the picture. While Sierra refers to Helen as being \u201clike a second mother to me,\u201d her perspective of Helen\u2019s refusal to babysit is condescending and harsh; there are definite reasons to feel sympathetic towards her \u2026 though, also, she did nearly kill herself and her child, which is the furthest thing possible from a good look.\n\nWhile there\u2019s no word yet as to how this will resolve, when things switch to Helen\u2019s perspective, Sierra\u2019s emotional fragility is nowhere on display. Instead, she brazenly sweeps into the Solloway house to swipe coffee, demand free babysitting, and attempt to steal Helen\u2019s vape pen. None of which is welcome, because Helen\u2019s having a turbulent day already.\n\nFor one thing, that morning Sasha tells her that he loves her. Then, after meeting with Carolina, her new friend and decorating client \u2014 whose producer husband is hoping to work with Sasha on his next movie \u2014 she has yet another face-off with Noah, who is now convinced that he loves her and that they\u2019re meant to be together. \u201cI don\u2019t want your love,\u201d she tells him. \u201cIt terrifies me and causes me nothing but pain.\u201d\n\nBut then, later, Helen seems to hit that point in a new relationship where you\u2019ve gotten to know the other person well enough to see some of their hidden ugliness. Not that Sasha is particularly repellant, but he\u2019s not at his best when dealing roughly with the untrustworthy daughter of his deceased fiancee. Later, at Carolina\u2019s party, he coldly decides to prioritize a third Maze movie instead of a project that would help out his struggling friend. In neither instance does he come off as \u201cthe perfect man,\u201d as previously advertised.\n\nWhich is fine. He\u2019s human, and he\u2019s allowed his flaws (especially if he wants to fit in with the rest of the characters on this show). But it leaves Helen ambivalent enough about him to go back to her place that night \u2014 where Priya, Vik\u2019s mother, confronts her. Over the course of the day, Priya has been trying to get Helen to orchestrate a meeting between baby Eddie and Priya\u2019s visiting brother (without Sierra being involved, since Priya doesn\u2019t want her family to know about that whole aspect of Eddie\u2019s existence), something which Helen doesn\u2019t want to do. But not only is Priya upset, she\u2019s also shocked that Helen has seemed to move on so quickly after Vik\u2019s passing, sneering at her as she leaves.\n\nIt\u2019s a scattered episode that ends with a ton of loose threads, random moments, and other distractions \u2014 there could be more setup for the ultimate ending here than is evident on the surface, but that\u2019s the optimistic viewpoint. One fact shines out, though, among all this emotional chaos: Nothing good happens when someone on The Affair drives a car, especially at night. I mean, just this week, Sierra has her accident and Helen and Sasha have an upsetting conversation as they drive home. No wonder these characters use Uber so much. It\u2019s self-preservation.\n\nThere Is No Objective Truth (Just Bullet Points)\n\n\u2022 What purpose does it serve, having Eden the publicist come back for a brief appearance at Carolina\u2019s party? It\u2019s hard to say, but her astonishment at Helen dating Sasha (and her happiness that Helen \u201cgot away from Noah Solloway\u201d) was a fun beat.\n\n\u2022 Today in \u201cwhy does that person look familiar?\u201d: Jessica Hecht, Helen\u2019s new bestie, has had a long and interesting career spanning several decades, but two roles of note \u2014 not only did she play Walter White\u2019s ex-partner, Gretchen, on Breaking Bad, but she was Susan, Ross\u2019s ex-wife\u2019s lesbian partner, on Friends.\n\n\u2022 Emily Browning faced quite the accent challenge this week, as a native Australian playing a Californian actress playing a character from a period drama \u2014 Madame Bovary is, of course, a French character, but in true period-drama tradition, Browning uses an upper-class British accent. The latter isn\u2019t flawless, but given Sierra\u2019s supposed lack of experience, it makes sense.\n\n\u2022 For those trying to keep track of the timeline (join me in the madness!), we learn that Eddie is four months and one week old here, which means that Vik has been dead for the same length of time. Also, as this episode seems to take place largely the day after Sasha\u2019s Halloween party, this means Eddie\u2019s birthday (and Vik\u2019s death day) was the last week of July.\n\n\u2022 12 might be too young to start babysitting, but don\u2019t forget that the girls of The Babysitter\u2019s Club ranged in age from 11 to 13.
