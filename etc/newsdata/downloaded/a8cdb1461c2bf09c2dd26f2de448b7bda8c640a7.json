Thebes was once the bustling royal capital of ancient Egypt. Digging in the area \u2060\u2014 around the modern-day city of Luxor \u2060\u2014 has led to a series of findings since efforts began in December 2017.\n\nThe coffins are estimated to be 3,000 years old, far older than most other ancient relics in the area. Still, they were found sealed and intact, featuring vibrant color inscriptions and well-preserved engravings.\n\nArchaeologists opened the coffins at a ceremony on Saturday to reveal perfectly preserved mummies inside.
