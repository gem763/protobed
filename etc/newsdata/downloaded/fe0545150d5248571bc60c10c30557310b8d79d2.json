(Arun Sankar/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\"There are lots of parallels to the ways in which China or Russia or even Qatar with Al Jazeera see information today,\" she said.\n\nFor countries that feel threatened, but lack the money or ability to fight back in conventional ways, Tworek says information manipulation is a \"cheaper and more efficient way to undermine a global geopolitical situation that seems stacked against them.\"\n\nTworek gave the example of state-run television stations, which deliver government messaging directly to citizens.\n\n\"There are multiple TV channels being funded by the Russian government [and] the Chinese government ... and a lot of those are spreading in other places,\" she said.\n\nWhat's really changed?\n\nDespite the arrival of troubling new technology \u2014 like deepfakes, videos that use artificial intelligence to manipulate clips of real people, and microtargeting, in which increasingly specific audiences can be targeted online based on their data and demographics \u2014 Tworek says not as much has changed about the modern disinformation landscape as we might think.\n\nFirst of all, she says, despite the internet's dominance in modern discourse, traditional media like television and radio remain a major force in many countries.\n\n'I'm uncomfortable with any solution that thinks that it's just about platforms and government,' said Tworek. (Heidi Tworek/Twitter)\n\nAs for online disinformation \u2014 the subject of much recent hand-wringing, including in the lead-up to Canada's federal election \u2014 Tworek points out that governments still have a number of ways to exert control.\n\nFirst, there's the physical infrastructure like fibre optic cables, which she calls \"a key place where where fighting is happening.\"\n\n\"I think we should be paying attention to like Africa, for example, where China has created a lot of the infrastructure for television, but also for things like 4G and 5G\" wireless coverage, she said.\n\nFinding a 'better balance' for regulation\n\nTworek says it's also important to note that the internet is run largely by private companies, which, just like they were a century ago, continue to be subject to government intervention and regulation.\n\n\"Social media companies in the U.S. have some forms of regulation and there's currently huge debates about whether there will be more of it,\" she said.\n\nOne of Tworek's messages to an anxious public is to give up on the idea that disinformation can be stamped out once and for all.\n\n\"This is not a problem we're going to solve,\" she said.\n\nWhen his popularity ratings faltered in 2018, footage of Russian President Vladimir Putin on vacation in Siberia was disseminated by a Russian state-owned television channel.
