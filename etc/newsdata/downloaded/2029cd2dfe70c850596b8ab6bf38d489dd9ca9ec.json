About 3 a.m. on Thursday he was jolted awake because his sleep apnea breathing machine stopped working.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden, I was like, \u2018I can\u2019t breathe,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nThe decision to turn electricity off for large areas of Northern California inconvenienced and frustrated hundreds of thousands of residents, but it became increasingly dangerous for people like Mr. Faus and the state\u2019s most vulnerable.\n\nAround 600,000 customers were still without power on Thursday afternoon and there was no clear indication of when it might be restored. That uncertainty heightened residents\u2019 anger as food spoiled and businesses and schools stayed closed.", "description": "As the widespread outages in the state continued a second day, fears grew for sick and older residents and those who rely on medical equipment.", "authors": ["Thomas Fuller"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/09/us/pge-outages-map-1570740121217/pge-outages-map-1570740121217-facebookJumbo-v4.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
