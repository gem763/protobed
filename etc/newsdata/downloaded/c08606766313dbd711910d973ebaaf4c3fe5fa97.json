That's the allegation that came out of an anonymous whistleblower complaint, which Trump accused of being partisan this week.\n\nWhile Congress was still technically on recess this week, key developments took place. Here's what happened:\n\nGiuliani associates, witnesses in probe, arrested\n\nOn Wednesday evening, two Ukrainian-born businessmen and associates of Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani were arrested on campaign finance charges.\n\nIgor Fruman and Lev Parnas helped Giuliani meet with a Ukrainian prosecutor as part of Giuliani's involvement with the push for Ukraine to investigate Biden. They were both scheduled to appear before Congress this week, but were arrested shortly before their slotted appearances. The two were then subpoenaed by House Democrats to testify.\n\nFederal authorities said the businessmen's campaign contributions \u201cconspired to circumvent the federal laws against foreign influence by engaging in a scheme to funnel foreign money to candidates for federal and state office so that the defendants could buy potential influence with candidates, campaigns and the candidates\u2019 governments.\"\n\nThe two were mega donors to Republican campaigns.\n\nOn Friday, The New York Times reported Giuliani is under investigation by federal prosecutors for his dealings in Ukraine.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhite House ramps up opposition to the inquiry\n\nThe administration is refusing to comply with requests for documents and witnesses related to the Ukraine scandal, the White House said on Tuesday, calling it a \"partisan inquiry.\"\n\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in response that the White House's actions may be considered evidence of obstruction.\n\nA key figure in the Ukraine controversy, Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, was scheduled to appear before Congress on Tuesday, but the State Department blocked him from testifying at the last minute. So, House Democrats subpoenaed him.\n\nI would love to send Ambassador Sondland, a really good man and great American, to testify, but unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court, where Republican\u2019s rights have been taken away, and true facts are not allowed out for the public.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 8, 2019\n\nRead more:\n\nSondland says he'll testify anyway\n\nSondland said Friday he will testify Thursday instead, an effort to comply with the House subpoena.\n\nDemocrats are interested in text messages he is believed to have on his personal phone, some of which were revealed after Kurt Volker's closed-door testimony last week.\n\n\"Are we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\" Top Ukraine diplomat Bill Taylor asked in a text message to Volker and Sondland on Sept. 1.\n\n\"Call me,\" Sondland texted back.\n\nRead more:\n\nOusted Ukraine ambassador appears before Congress\n\nFormer Ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, testified on Friday in a 10-hour session before Congress that Trump \"pressured\" the State Department to remove her from her post in a \"concerted campaign\" against her.\n\nYovanovitch appeared despite a State Department direction not to testify.\n\n\"We need to rebuild diplomacy as the first resort to advance America\u2019s interests and the front line of America\u2019s defense,\" she said in her opening statement. \"I fear that not doing so will harm our nation\u2019s interest, perhaps irreparably.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump and Biden escalate rhetoric\n\nIn campaign stops this week, Trump dished out new rally material targeting the Bidens and top Democrats involved in the impeachment probe.\n\n\"They want to erase your vote like it never existed. They want to erase your voice and they want to erase your future. But they will fail because in America the people rule again,\" Trump said in Minnesota on Thursday.", "description": "Week three of the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump has wrapped - and so much happened.
