The XLM/USD pair broke many key supports near $0.0620 and $0.0600 to enter a bearish zone. Moreover, there was a close below the $0.0620 level and 55 simple moving average (4-hours). Finally, the price traded to a new monthly low at $0.0525 before starting an upside correction.\n\nThere was a break above the $0.0550 level to start the correction. Moreover, there was a break above a connecting bearish trend line at $0.0592 on the 4-hours chart. However, the upward move was capped by the $0.0620 resistance area. Additionally, the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the last major decline from the $0.0888 high to $0.0525 low also prevented gains.\n\nThe price is now trading well below the $0.0620 level and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours). To start a solid recovery, the price must move above $0.0620 and $0.0650. The next key resistance is near the $0.0700 level. Besides, the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the last major decline from the $0.0888 high to $0.0525 low is near the $0.0707 level.\n\nConversely, if the price fails to break the $0.0620 resistance, it could continue to move down. An immediate support is near the $0.0550 level. If there is a downside break below $0.0550, the price could retest the $0.0525 low. Any further declines might call for a push towards the $0.0500 support area.\n\nThe chart indicates that XLM price is clearly trading below a strong resistance area near the $0.0620 level and the 55 SMA. If there is a successful close above the 55 SMA, there are chances of a solid recovery to $0.0700. If not, the price might retest the $0.0525 low or it could even test the $0.0500 support.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\n4 hours MACD \u2013 The MACD for XLM/USD is currently losing pace in the bullish zone.\n\n4 hours RSI \u2013 The RSI for XLM/USD is struggling to move above the 50 level.\n\nKey Support Levels \u2013 $0.0620 and $0.0650.\n\nKey Resistance Levels \u2013 $0.0550, $0.0525 and $0.0500.", "description": "Stellar lumen price is trading in a bearish zone below $0.0650 against the US Dollar.
