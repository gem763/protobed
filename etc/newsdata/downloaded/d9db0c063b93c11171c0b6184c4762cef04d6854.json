A parent discovered the kids after police had started a search.\n\nIn a correspondence from the school\u2019s principal, Sarah Simmons, shared by a local ABC affiliate, she informed parents of the incident, writing, \u201cAt approximately 2:50 this afternoon, the third-grade students lined up to return to the building at the end of recess. Upon entering the building, the teachers determined that two students were missing. I was immediately notified and we began a search of the campus and called their parents. I also notified the Holly Springs Police Department that the children were missing.\n\n\u201cAfter receiving a call from a concerned citizen (that also happens to be a Holly Grove parent), the police found the students at a McDonald\u2019s about one mile from campus and returned them to school. I will be determining appropriate disciplinary action to ensure that the students understand the severity of their actions.\u201d\n\nSgt. Tom Brienzi of the Holly Springs Police Department told ABC 11 that the police force had started strategically placing officers in the area to set up a perimeter when the citizen call came in.\n\n\"All of us began breathing again at that point,\" said Sgt. Brienzi.\"Once they maintained custody of those children and confirmed we had exactly who we thought we had, we were all able to take a sigh of relief at that point.\"\n\nThe school, which did not immediately reply to Yahoo Lifestyle\u2019s request for comment, is now using this as a lesson learned, and as Principal Simmons wrote in her email to parents, \u201cOur staff will use this as a learning opportunity to continue to improve our supervisory practices.\u201d\n\nBoth Principal Simmons and the Holly Springs police are also using this as an opportunity to remind parents to teach their children important lessons about following rules, especially rules about not wandering off. As local parent Korey Tibbet said in an interview with the local affiliate, \u201cThank God everything worked out well. Nobody got hurt.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "A parent discovered the kids at McDonald's after police had started a search.", "authors": ["Elena Sheppard", "Wellness Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0peSAgLcXUU.hEbtPCQpMw--~B/aD0yMjUwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-07/92cd23e0-aefc-11e9-be77-2e143a17010b", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
