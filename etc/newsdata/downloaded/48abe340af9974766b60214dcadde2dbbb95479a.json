Its first leader was Charles Beckwith, who had spent time with the British Army\u2019s Special Air Service in the 1960s and was influenced by his experience there.\n\nA Special Operations Forces soldier in Afghanistan.

That mission was aborted before Delta Force could act because not enough helicopters made it to the Desert One staging area in the Iranian desert in operational condition. Delta was also involved in the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu in Somalia, an event that was portrayed in the book and film \u201cBlack Hawk Down.\u201d The unit was responsible for the capture of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein and also played a role in the operation that led to the deaths of his sons Uday and Qusay. The group has also worked on operations in Latin America, including the hunts for Colombian drug kingpin Pablo Escobar and Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega.\n\nThe process of becoming a Delta Force operator is long and rigorous. Applicants undergo a series of grueling tests, including a timed 40-mile hike across the mountains of West Virginia and a \u201ccommander\u2019s board,\u201d in which current and former senior Delta members ask questions and ultimately decide a candidate\u2019s fate. If selected, candidates go through a six-month operator training course that teaches specialized skills, like hostage rescue and compound breaching. If they make it through the operator training, they\u2019re officially part of \u201cthe Unit,\u201d as the group has been called.\n\nDelta Force operates under Joint Special Operations Command, or JSOC, which was formed in 1980 and also oversees other units, including the Army\u2019s 75th Ranger Regiment and Navy SEAL Team 6. By 2009, JSOC had organized itself so that one unit would have primary responsibility for each combat theater: the Rangers in Afghanistan; SEAL Team 6 in the Horn of Africa and Yemen; and Delta Force in Iraq and Syria.\n\nIn addition to its being featured in \u201cBlack Hawk Down,\u201d the unit has been referenced elsewhere in popular culture, starting with the 1986 film \u201cThe Delta Force,\u201d starring Chuck Norris and Lee Marvin. It was also the basis for the CBS series \u201cThe Unit,\u201d which ran from 2006 to 2009. Jack Bauer, the lead character in \u201c24,\u201d was described as an ex-Delta Force captain. The unit also served as the inspiration for a series of computer games in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "While SEAL Team 6 made headlines for the 2011 Osama bin Laden operation in Pakistan, Delta Force, the unit that hunted ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, has been quietly at the heart of the more recent campaign that destroyed the Islamic State\u2019s physical caliphate.", "authors": ["Christopher Wilson", "Sean Naylor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/NObU7vhT3eMP.APvi2oFnw--~B/aD0yMTQzO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/571479e0-f9b4-11e9-bdff-7d9ae9808b65", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
