The fixtures do not get any easier for him, with United hosting bitter rivals Liverpool on Sunday looking to end their 100 per cent start to the season.", "description": "The club are looking for an overhaul of the squad following a woeful start to the season which sees United in 12th place after eight games", "authors": ["Alex Milne", "Image", "Simone Arveda Epa-Efe Rex", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20570475.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Newcastle-United-v-Manchester-United-Premier-League-St-James-Park.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
