The hard part will be calming energy markets, where oil prices have jumped faster than at any time in over a decade.\n\nThe attack on a Saudi Arabian plant that accounts for 5 percent of global oil supplies and a nearby facility took 5.7 million barrels a day of production off line for at least a few days. It also uncovered the significant danger that drones pose to the sprawling processing plants, pipelines and refineries of the Persian Gulf.\n\n\u201cThe psyche has been altered,\u201d said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for Oil Price Information Service. \u201cNow you have the thought, `What if the other shoe drops and we have a wider conflict?\u2019\u201d\n\nFor years, American and Saudi security analysts have worried about the Abqaiq processing center, which removes sulfur impurities and makes crude oil less volatile so it can be safely exported on tankers.
