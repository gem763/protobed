He took to social media to announce that after covering the cost of a case of Busch Lite, he would be donating the rest of the proceeds to the University of Iowa Stead Family Children's Hospital.\n\nAfter the \"GMA\" broadcast, money transfers and donations flooded his Venmo account. Within hours, he'd received more than 2,000 notifications, King told \"GMA.\"\n\nBusch Beer and Venmo announced on Twitter that they would match King\u2019s donation. As of Friday, King had raised $157,000.\n\nKing told \"GMA\" he intends to keep his Venmo account open for donations as they continue to appear until the end of the month. After that, he will cut a check from the money in his account and present it to the hospital in person, where he will go on a tour of the hospital facilities and get to meet some of the kids who will benefit from the massive donation.\n\n\"We can\u2019t think \u2013 our minds are blown by this,\" tweeted an account which states is the official Twitter account of University of Iowa Stead Family Children's Hospital. \"Thank you to everyone who helped reach this milestone! We\u2019re so grateful!\"\n\nABC News\u2019 Laura Laughead contributed to this report", "description": "Carson King, 24, in a tweet said that donations just hit the $1 million mark.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/CarsonKing_190918_CA3_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
