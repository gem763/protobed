That\u2019s my mission, that\u2019s what President Trump certainly wants me to work to achieve and I hope that the Islamic Republic of Iran sees it that way,\u201d Pompeo told reporters.\n\nHe did not provide details about the coalition. The United States has however been trying to create a global maritime security alliance since attacks on oil tankers in Gulf waters, which Washington also blamed on Iran.\n\nUAE, Saudi Arabia, Britain and Bahrain have said they will participate. Iraq said it would not join, and most European countries have been reluctant to sign up for fear of stoking regional tensions.\n\nPompeo described his proposed coalition as \u201can act of diplomacy\u201d while Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Mohammed Javad Zarif, told CNN on Thursday that the Islamic Republic \u201cwon\u2019t blink\u201d if it has to defend itself against any U.S. or Saudi military strike, which he said would lead to \u201call-out war\u201d.\n\nLater on Friday, Zarif called Kuwait\u2019s foreign minister Sheikh Sabah al Khalid Al Sabah where the two discussed measures to de-escalate tensions in the region, state news agency KUNA reported.\n\n\u2018B TEAM\u2019\n\nZarif mocked Pompeo, saying he was part of a so-called \u201cB-team\u201d, along with Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, which is trying to dupe Trump into opting for war.\n\nPompeo on Wednesday met Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has called the assault on oil plants a \u201ctest of global will\u201d.\n\nRiyadh has displayed what it described as remnants of 25 Iranian drones and missiles used in the strike, saying it was evidence of Iranian aggression.\n\nSaudi minister of state for foreign affairs Adel al-Jubeir said on Thursday the attacks were an \u201cextension of the Iranian regime\u2019s hostile and outlawed behaviour\u201d and called on the international community to \u201cshoulder its responsibilities and take a firm stance towards Iran\u2019s criminal behaviour.\u201d\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo takes part in a meeting with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, September 18, 2019.

U.S. and Saudi officials rejected the claim, saying the attack had not come from the south.\n\nOil prices, which soared following the attack, steadied after Saudi Arabia pledged to restore full oil production by the end of September. [O/R]\n\nU.N. MEETING IN FOCUS\n\nProof of Iranian responsibility could provoke a response from Riyadh and Washington, which want to curb Iranian influence in the region.\n\nPompeo said the attacks would be a major focus of next week\u2019s annual U.N. General Assembly meeting and suggested Riyadh could make its case there.\n\nThe U.S. issued visas allowing Rouhani and Zarif to travel to New York to attend the U.N. General Assembly, Iranian U.N. mission spokesman Alireza Miryousefi confirmed to Reuters.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nZarif is to leave for New York on Friday to attend the General Assembly, the ministry spokesman tweeted on Thursday, after earlier reports of a U.S. delay in issuing a visa for the visit.\n\nTehran says the U.S. accusations are part of Washington\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d policy on Iran to force it to renegotiate a 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which Trump exited last year, reimposing sanctions to choke off Iran\u2019s oil exports.\n\nTehran, which has gradually scaled back its nuclear commitments, has rejected any talks unless sanctions are lifted.\n\n\u201cThe United States is now using oil as a weapon; oil is not a weapon,\u201d Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zangeneh said.", "description": "The United States said on Thursday it was building a coalition to deter Iranian threats following a weekend attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities.", "authors": ["Tuqa Khalid", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431674108&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I110", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
