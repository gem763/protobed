That was the last time we saw her,\u201d claimed the insider.\n\nHowever, another well-placed source, also close to the production, alleged that Khumalo was shown the door by the production house after she made difficult demands on set.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t want to share her wardrobe room with other actors and made everyone\u2019s job difficult. They had to let her go,\u201d claimed the source.\n\nKhumalo\u2019s manager, who goes only by the name Pat, told City Press yesterday his client was not in a position to comment.\n\n\u201cDue to a contractual agreement between my client and the production house we cannot comment at this stage.

According to the insider, the Mamosadi hitmaker was also at the Pyramid on the same day Khumalo was seen there.\n\nMany people would remember Motsilanyane as Lucille Vilakazi on Rhythm City, which ran from 2007 to 2015.\n\nMotsilanyane, who made her first TV debut on e.tv youth soap opera Backstage as KB, did not respond to our calls and messages.\n\nThe Lebo Mathosa Story tells the story of the late Boom Shaka singer\u2019s incredible life.\n\nThe viewers will have a glimpse of Mathosa\u2019s incredible journey as a member of the popular group, which became one of the most successful kwaito groups in South Africa in the early 1990s.\n\nCity Press can reveal that other actors who will be part of the biopic are legendary actor Sello Maake Ka-Ncube, dancer Khabonina Qubeka, veteran actress Connie Chiume and socialite Somizi Mhlongo\u2019s daughter Bahumi Madisakwane, who will be playing a young Lebo Mathosa.\n\nThe final cast will be revealed at the media set visit tomorrow.\n\nDo you think KB is the perfect singer to play Lebo?\n\nSMS us on 35697 using the keyword LEBO and tell us what you think.
