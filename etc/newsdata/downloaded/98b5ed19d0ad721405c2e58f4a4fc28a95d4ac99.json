He also noted the pleasant weekend weather that made it \u201can ideal time for motorcyclists to ride.\u201d\n\nTownsend said Prince George\u2019s County is one of the deadliest areas for motorcyclists in the region, along with Fairfax County and the District.\n\nPrince George\u2019s police reported two deaths in separate motorcycle crashes, the latest about 8 p.m. Sunday on Baltimore Avenue north of the University of Maryland campus in College Park.\n\nAuthorities have not released details of how the crash occurred or the identity of the motorcycle\u2019s driver.

The driver of the BMW and a passenger were not injured.\n\nPolice said they had not reached the victim\u2019s family as of early Monday and his name was not immediately made public. The crash shut down all lanes of the major highway on Sunday night.\n\nAlso in Prince William, a motorcyclist and his passenger were killed when the cyclist, who police said was speeding, ran a red light and collided with an SUV about 5 a.m. Saturday in Gainesville.\n\nPolice said James Edward Beach II, 41, of Gainesville, and his passenger, Shannon Nicole Meyer, 22 of Bristow, were thrown from the 2006 Kawasaki Ninja.
