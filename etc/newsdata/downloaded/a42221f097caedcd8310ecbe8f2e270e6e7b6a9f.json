You likely have one or two of these magic shirts in your closet and you could likely use an upgrade. We found some of the best ones around, with particular focus on options that take modern fabric technology and infuse it into their offerings.\n\nCommuter Dress Shirt, $118 at Rhone: This is one of the strongest button-down upgrades you can make. I loved it when I first tried it and naturally shared Rhone\u2019s expansion of the line with some great new colorways. Its Italian-made fabric is wrinkle-resistant, 4-way stretching, moisture-wicking, and machine washable for easy maintenance.\n\nHybrid Denim Shirt, $88 at Hill City: Ah, denim. A blend of cotton and polyester meets the brand\u2019s cooling technology to give you the best of all worlds. Quick-drying and soft to the touch, this versatile shirt is your go-to whether you\u2019re boarding a plane or planning a board meeting.\n\nWrinkle-Free Performance Short-Sleeve, $98 at UNTUCKit: I\u2019m short and I hate tucking in. That means button-downs are tough sometimes. But not with UNTUCKit, whose goal is to give you shirts that look great hanging free. This shirt is a workhorse of specs. Stretchy, moisture-wicking, wrinkle-resistant, you name it. And it looks fantastic in nearly any setting (I\u2019ve tried).\n\nStellar, $108 at Buttercloth: A step up in both style and fit, Buttercloth isn\u2019t messing around with this dress shirt. Wrinkle-free fabric and built-in collar stays make it easy to maintain. And a 6-way stretch design lets you move however you want to. The contrasting details in the buttons, cuffs, and collar will give your look an accent that\u2019s sure to get some attention, to boot.\n\nThe Air Oxford Short-Sleeve Shirt, $58 at Everlane: This is likely one of the most comfortable shirts I\u2019ve ever worn and it works great casually or at work. A lightweight design and seven different colors give you versatility for days.
