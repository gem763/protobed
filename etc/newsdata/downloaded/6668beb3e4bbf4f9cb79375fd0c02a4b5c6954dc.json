Whether it\u2019s potential antitrust violations or historic data breaches, Google and Facebook have been forced to beef up their lobbying arms to stave off regulation and shut up members of Congress.\n\nOn Friday, 2020 presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) announced a new plan aimed at making lawmakers less susceptible to these lobbyists and their \u201cdisinformation\u201d over sensitive issues like tech consolidation and climate change: an army of government-mandated tech nerds housed in a reinstated Office of Technology Assessment (OTA).\n\n\u201cMembers of Congress aren\u2019t just dependent on corporate lobbyist propaganda because they\u2019re bought and paid for,\u201d Warren said. \u201cIt\u2019s also because of a successful, decades-long campaign to starve Congress of the resources and expertise needed to independently evaluate complex public policy questions.\u201d\n\nOver the years, offices like the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the Congressional Research Service were created to provide better resources for lawmakers when making policy decisions. They conduct independent reports over government spending and act as a nonpartisan check on partisan lawmakers. Over time, some groups have been defunded, including the OTA.\n\n\u201cWhen Congress decides whether it should break up big tech companies, our representatives shouldn\u2019t have to rely on Google\u2019s policy team.\u201d\n\nThe OTA was established in the 1970s to help Congress understand and legislate complicated issues involving science and technology. But in the 1990s, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich led a successful effort to dissolve it. Warren wants to reinstate it.\n\nIn her plan proposal, Warren argues that a reinstated OTA would help lawmakers grapple with policy issues involving some of the country\u2019s largest tech firms, like Google and Facebook. Under her administration, the OTA would compile short-term requests from members as they prepare for hearings and house experts on specific issues like climate change and technology consolidation.\n\nWarren specifically calls out how members like Sens. Roy Blunt (R-MO) and Orrin Hatch (R-UT) behaved in last year\u2019s hearing with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Blunt bragged about putting his \u201cFacebook address\u201d on his business cards, and Hatch questioned the company\u2019s business model, resulting in the iconic \u201csenator, we run ads,\u201d remark from Zuckerberg.\n\n\u201cEven Senators well-versed in social media struggled to ask about difficult concepts like end-to-end encryption, location tracking, and the competitive landscape of Silicon Valley,\u201d Warren said. \u201cWhen Congress decides whether it should break up big tech companies, our representatives shouldn\u2019t have to rely on Google\u2019s policy team to understand the effects of technology consolidation.\u201d\n\nCongress isn\u2019t the only government body having a difficult time forcing tech to change. The Federal Trade Commission could only get $5 billion out of Facebook for its Cambridge Analytica scandal, a measly sum in comparison to the company\u2019s total profits. As a response to these tech companies, the FTC created its own body, the tech task force, to focus on these issues, specifically. The OTA could be that, but for Congress.\n\nIt\u2019s not just Warren calling for OTA to make a comeback. Over the past few months, other members of Congress have led efforts to reinstate it. Sens. Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Mazie Hirono (D-HI) have led a bipartisan effort in the Senate and Reps. Bill Foster (D-IL) and Mark Takano (CA) have led a corresponding one in the House by introducing the Office of Technology Assessment Improvement and Enhancement Act.\n\nWarren\u2019s plan also calls for competitive salaries for congressional staffers and an increase in funding for congressional support agencies like the Congressional Budget Office and the GAO.", "description": "On September 27th, 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren put out a new plan expanding on how she would fight political corruption if elected president. This plan would work to provide Congress with the nonpartisan resources it needs to better understand the growing issues around technology and science without the help of lobbyists.", "authors": ["Makena Kelly", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dzXOMguJyuYJ2noNYXysSh4kGgw=/0x412:5760x3428/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19237832/1169640282.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
