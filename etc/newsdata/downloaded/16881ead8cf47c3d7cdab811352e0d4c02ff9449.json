Guilty if the former, not guilty if it were the latter.\n\n\u2018This is a case, we submit, about truth and lies. There is a stark difference between the two and we submit that if you approach this case by deciding which facts you are sure about, that will lead you to a conclusion one way or the other.\u2019\n\nMiss Heeley, defending, told jurors the former footballer kissed a woman who was not expecting it and did not like it, but that did not make him a sex offender.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe added: \u2018A kiss could mean many things, including a celebration when you score one of the greatest goals England has ever seen, against Scotland in Euro 96.\u2019\n\nThe trial continues.", "description": "Paul Gascoigne was accused of 'lying through his teeth' when he said he only sounded slurred when he kissed a woman on a train because he had removed a dental...", "authors": ["Zoe Drewett"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_90118228-e1571236382210_1571236709.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
