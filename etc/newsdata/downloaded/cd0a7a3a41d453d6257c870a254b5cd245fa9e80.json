This has made his job much, much more difficult.\n\nHe has somehow still dragged a potential majority of MPs towards him. But it's a crew that is prone to mutiny. On one side of his motley vessel stand the Brexiteers. They know his deal is far from perfect, but they know it isn't going to get any better than this. On the other side are the potential Labour rebels and excommunicated Tories. They want to get Brexit done, but are uneasy about Johnson's methods and about his ultimate destination.\n\nEvery time he offers a bit of snuff to one side, there's a risk that the boat tilts too far and the other side starts looking to abandon ship. He'll be lucky to keep everyone on deck over the coming fractious few days.\n\nThere's also a bit of fog about. The Europeans want to be helpful, as they've invested heavily in this deal. But they have to make a call as to whether to offer him the supposed lifeline of a delay to Brexit.\n\nJohnson doesn't want it, but he may well need it. He's just not sure how much rope they're going to give him. And the offer they make will structure the choices of a lot of other players in the British parliament as well.\n\nNo Brexit delay from the Europeans? Johnson's deal will then surely pass, as MPs face a straight choice between a deal they don't like and a no-deal they like even less. But for the Europeans it's a big political and reputational risk if this ends up as a no-deal Brexit by mistake.\n\nA short Brexit delay? Enough time to square the remaining circles, so Johnson will probably get his Brexit deal through - after a few more weeks of parliamentary squalls.\n\nA long Brexit delay? This is a temptation to more interminable British parliamentary infighting, and probably an election or even a referendum. But Johnson is in the box seat to win the election: he's ahead in the polls, the opposition is weak, and he has the better argument.\n\nThere's one thing all these three scenarios have in common: Johnson gets there in the end. He may not have enough of a fair wind to get there by Halloween, but it seems more and more likely he'll win the offshore marathon even if he loses the short-course sprint.", "description": "Johnson has wind in his sails but he's tacking dangerously close to the rocks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.384%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_23/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/9d03d43bcc262a7f25d8a3c08112ea59b89f88c1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
