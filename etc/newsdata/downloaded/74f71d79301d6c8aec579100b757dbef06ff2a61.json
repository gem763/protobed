I\u2019m determined to get a picture of all of us while we are here but for now it\u2019s just me, Rexy and Leighton\u2019s butt.\n\n\u2018The boys are having far too much fun for pictures. Feeling so lucky to spend precious time in, what I can only describe as paradise, with them making memories. Hurry up and get here Joe Joe we miss you.\u2019\n\nFans were quick to praise Stacey for posting the unedited photos on her Instagram, as she rocked her natural post-baby body five months after giving birth to baby Rex.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer followers posted: \u2018Amazing, you look beautiful and so real, my little boy is nearly 4 months old so I love watching the journey you and Rex have\u2019.\n\nOthers added: \u2018You look amazing, enjoy your holiday with your beautiful boys\u2019 and \u2018you seriously are an amazing example to young mums or any mums for that matter! Beautiful girl with a beautiful life.\u2019\n\nStacey, 30, has always been honest with her fans about the realities and occasional struggles of motherhood, rather than just posting the \u2018perfect\u2019 photos on Instagram.\n\nStacey is waiting for Joe Swash to fly out to join them (Picture: @staceysolomon)\n\nShe recently shared a heartfelt post about feeling like a \u2018failure\u2019 for not being able to breastfeed Rex for very long.\n\nStacey wrote: \u2018Lots of people have been asking me if I\u2019m still breast feeding. It\u2019s taken me a bit of time to feel okay about saying no.\n\n\u2018I stopped a couple of months ago & I really struggled to come to terms with it & actually say it out loud. Breastfeeding never happened for me the way that I imagined.\n\nFans love seeing Stacey\u2019s honest social media posts (Picture: @staceysolomon)\n\n\u2018I did my best to try & master it, but it wasn\u2019t to be. On day 5 we ended up back in hospital because of weight loss & I ended up pumping in between feeds to make sure he put it back on so we could be discharged, then I continued this at home until he reached his birthweight.\u2019\n\nShe added: \u2018By the time I did two full days back at work without him on the boob or pumping my milk dried up & before I knew it my breastfeeding journey was over. I felt sad for quite some time, every time he rooted my gut ached.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I felt like I\u2019d failed & that I\u2019d lost the chance to have that special time & bond with Rex. I felt like everyone else was going to feed him & I\u2019d lose my baby.\u2019\n\nShe explained that ultimately she wanted to do what was best for her baby to help him gain weight and bottle feeding also gives other members of the family a chance to get involved with feeding time.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
