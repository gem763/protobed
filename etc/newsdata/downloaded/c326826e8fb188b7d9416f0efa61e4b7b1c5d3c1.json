The closures will include 40 Bed Bath & Beyond stores and 20 \u201cconcept\u201d stores.\n\nOther brands in the Bed Bath & Beyond portfolio include Cost Plus World Market and Harmon.\n\n\u201cWith this action, we are increasing the profitability of our remaining portfolio and believe that our remaining fleet will benefit from our renewed focus on driving traffic and operating efficiency,\u201d Winston said, according to a FactSet transcript.\n\nRead: Costco earnings: Texas and Florida alone could get dozens more warehouses and it wouldn\u2019t be enough\n\nThe company also has more than 400 leases expiring over the next couple of years that the company said.\n\n\u201c[W]e are encouraged about the progress the interim leadership is making around gross margins and SG&A as well as the accelerated store closures,\u201d wrote Raymond James analysts in a note. \u201cMoving forward, the potential for non-core asset sales and new CEO announcement are two catalysts that should move Bed Bath & Beyond higher over the coming weeks/ months.\u201d\n\nBed Bath & Beyond\u2019s CEO stepped down in May.
