United have been terrible in the last few weeks, leading to fevered speculation over Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s future and the wisdom of appointing him in the first place, while Liverpool have sailed on so serenely that J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team building and tactics are now attracting more attention than Pep Guardiola\u2019s at Manchester City.\n\nAlisson ready for injury return as Liverpool visit Manchester United Read more\n\nAs a long-established football clich\u00e9 would have it City are looking for a favour from United on Sunday, in which case they might be looking in entirely the wrong place. United are struggling to do themselves any favours at the moment, and after City\u2019s second defeat of the season arrived at the hands of Wolves the defending champions have yet to prove they are capable of taking advantage of any Liverpool slips in any case.\n\nA combination of City\u2019s fragility and Liverpool\u2019s consistency has brought about a remarkable turnaround in English football in an unexpectedly short space of time. Clearly it is too early in the season for talk of the title being Liverpool\u2019s to lose or City giving up on the league in order to concentrate on Europe, but a division which last season prided itself on providing one of the few close-run contests among the major leagues is already running counter to type.\n\nShould Liverpool win at Old Trafford to equal City\u2019s Premier League record of 18 successive victories there will be a gap of at least eight points at the top of the table with a quarter of the season completed. Not only would this have been hard to predict last season, when only a point separated the top two teams after 38 games, but it is a new departure for the rest of Europe to take in.\n\nIn this country we are accustomed to looking a little sneeringly at some of the lop-sided leagues around Europe, with their regular winners and big gaps between title hopefuls and the rest, yet this season England is an exception to its own rule. Look around the rest of the bigger European leagues and the widest margin separating first and second to be found anywhere is a mere two points. Just one win potentially allows Barcelona to overtake Real Madrid in Spain, and the same is true for Nantes behind Paris Saint-Germain in France, Sivasspor behind Alanyaspor in Turkey and even Celtic behind Rangers in Scotland. In Germany, Italy and Portugal only a single point splits first and second, while in the Eredivisie at the moment Ajax and Eindhoven are level on points.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pep Guardiola has been forced to use Fernandinho at centre-half.

That is last season\u2019s top six, obviously, though as Leicester City are top four at the minute they should probably count too. So it is not the case that Liverpool have not yet played anyone, and while we should perhaps wait until the next two obstacles in United and Tottenham Hotspur have been cleared, the initial theory that the title will be decided by games between Liverpool and City \u2013 their first league meeting of the season is on 10 November at Anfield \u2013 is weakening by the day.\n\nManchester City flirt with defensive dark side as Death Star\u2019s flaws emerge | Jonathan Wilson Read more\n\nShould City\u2019s woes continue, or put another way should Guardiola persist in playing a high defensive line with Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi at the heart of it, another pre-season theory will soon bite the dust. It may turn out that the top two are not engaged in a private duel with the rest of the league as spectators after all. City are only a point ahead of the chasing pack, and should a few more opponents come up with the equivalent of Adama Traor\u00e9 in the coming weeks the two-horse title race everyone predicted may not materialise.\n\nIt is a safe bet that City will improve significantly when Kevin de Bruyne returns, though with Europe in mind the player Guardiola currently needs as soon as possible is Aymeric Laporte. While City were unlucky with injuries to the French defender and John Stones coming so soon after Vincent Kompany\u2019s release, a situation where Fernandinho is the most reliable centre-back is unsustainable. Guardiola may have to buy in January even if Laporte recovers on schedule in the new year, because it would be a lot to ask of a player returning from a cruciate injury to both slot in seamlessly and restore authority.\n\nLiverpool and City\u2019s continental rivals look on with interest, even if we are still only in October. There has been a progression at the Etihad in the last four years, City have steadily improved with each campaign to the extent where they saw off a challenge from Liverpool last season that would have overwhelmed anyone else. That process has now been interrupted, if not yet halted, and if Liverpool are to be beneficiaries they must adapt to the subtly different pressure of holding their nerve while out in front. In his time in England Klopp has seen Leicester, Chelsea and City do exactly that. He has waited patiently for his own chance, and a perfect start has brought it about. Liverpool have stepped out of City\u2019s shadow, and the story of the rest of the domestic season will be how well they cope with the relentless expectation.", "description": "After a perfect Premier League start J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team must adapt to the pressure of holding their nerve while well ahead", "authors": ["Paul Wilson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c88004f044b18c42574e0152c8dc862c8535da76/0_56_4250_2550/master/4250.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=665ea91894b8f0597546333c21d2beee", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
