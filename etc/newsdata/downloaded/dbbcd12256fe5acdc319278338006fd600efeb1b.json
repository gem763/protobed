To be honest, first half I wasn\u2019t happy with our performance,\u201d Pochettino said.\n\n\u201cFrom the beginning we had a plan. We didn\u2019t respect the plan. I told the players at halftime. We scored two goals but if you only analyse the performance it wasn\u2019t great.\n\n\u201cWe conceded a lot of chances to them and the first goal was painful. We didn\u2019t show the aggression these games demand.\u201d\n\nIt was a strange display by Tottenham who appeared to be playing in second gear at times and failed to show the ruthless streak needed to see out games in Europe.\n\nSince scoring a last-gasp winner at Fulham in the Premier League in January, Tottenham have managed just only two victories on the road \u2014 both in the Champions League against Borussia Dortmund and Ajax.\n\nNo team has conceded more Champions League goals (21) than Tottenham since the start of last season.\n\n\u201cAt this level you need to match your opponents. That is the first demand,\u201d Pochettino said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about tactics or quality players but the level of fight. You need to match the opponent in aggressivity, excitement, motivation.\u201d\n\nFrench midfielder Valbuena praised his side\u2019s response after finding themselves in trouble so early.\n\n\u201cIt was hard seeing Tottenham taking a 2-0 lead, when we had wasted several opportunities of our own,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t despair though and we had a great performance tonight.\n\n\u201cWe are proud of ourselves and our fans who helped us a lot. We were two goals down and everyone thought we would give up. But that wasn\u2019t the case. We continued and showed excellent mentality and strength of character.\u201d", "description": "Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino accused his players of \"not respecting the plan\" after they squandered a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 away to Olympiakos Piraeus in their Champions League opener on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431373630&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H1YL", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
