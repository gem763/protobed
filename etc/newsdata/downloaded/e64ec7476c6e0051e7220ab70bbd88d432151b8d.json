REUTERS/Mariana Greif\n\nThe liberal Frente Amplio coalition has run Uruguay for more than 14 years, but Martinez, a former mayor of the capital Montevideo, faced a significant challenge from lawyer Luis Lacalle Pou, 46, who may now form a right-wing coalition with small parties to oust him.\n\nWith 27% of polling stations counted, Frente Amplio had 36% of the vote compared to the National Party of Lacalle with 35%, the electoral body said.\n\nIf no candidate gets over 50% of the vote, the two with the most votes will meet in a run-off on the last Sunday of November.\n\n\u201cI offer my congratulations to my opponent in the second round,\u201d Martinez told journalists outside his campaign headquarters.\n\nHe added in a tweet: \u201cWe will continue doing all we can to ensure stability and certainty. Uruguay has to continue growing, distributing wealth and being a nation of justice.\u201d\n\nLacalle looks likely to lead a coalition of conservative groups into the second round that could displace the Frente Amplio.\n\nSpeaking after polls closed, Lacalle suggested he could lead a \u201cmulticolored front, headed by the National Party\u201d and that there was \u201cfertile ground\u201d for agreements with other parties.\n\nErnesto Talvi, leader of the smaller, centre-right Colorado party, said on Sunday he would throw his weight behind Lacalle.\n\n\u201cUruguay needs a change, we invite our voters to support Lacalle Pou,\u201d he said.", "description": "OkRuling liberal coalition candidate Daniel Martinez was narrowly leading the Uruguay election in the early hours of Monday, according to an official count of just over a quarter of votes, but a determining second round will be needed.", "authors": ["Fabien Werner", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445719606&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R08Z", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
