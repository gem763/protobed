Earnings came in at $1.66, or $0.05 ahead of estimates, but is breaking to record highs and out of an almost-two-year inverse head and shoulder pattern. Entries may develop as the stock consolidates gains in the days ahead. The nearly 2% dividend yield doesn't hurt either.\n\nOn the flip side, Exxon Mobil (XOM) , which reports on Nov. 1, remains a worrisome chart, as it eyes significant lateral support reaching back to mid-2011, which, if breached, could lead to a quick and perhaps unsustainable spike in its already high 5% yield.\n\n-- Written by Jim Koford\n\n(Caterpillar is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS member club.
