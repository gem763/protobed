An unmistakable picture of a tot will pop up, in the same way that a standard airline map will indicate which seats are in an exit row or have simply been booked.\n\nRead more: A mom traveling with her 4-month-old baby gave passengers earplugs to keep everyone happy on a 10-hour flight\n\nThe airline map shows passengers where babies are sitting\n\nIt\u2019s a concept that could potentially benefit everyone involved. It keeps children only near passengers who aren\u2019t bothered by crying and other disruptions, and puts passengers who want nothing to do with a fussy baby aisles away from young families.\n\ncaption Some say flying near children is simply part of the process. Others say they shouldn\u2019t have to be subjected to a baby\u2019s cries on a long flight. source Getty/encrier\n\nBut it\u2019s been met with mixed reactions online, with some fliers expressing relief that they can avoid sitting near babies and others saying that flying near a crying child is simply par for the (flight) course.\n\nThank you, @JAL_Official_jp for warnings me about where babies plan to scream and yell during a 13 hour trip. This really ought to be mandatory across the board. Please take note, @qatarairways: I had 3 screaming babies next to me on my JFK-DOH flight two weeks ago. pic.twitter.com/kQYQFIqqCD \u2014 Rahat Ahmed \u2708\ufe0f Tokyo (@dequinix) September 24, 2019\n\n\u201cI have no issues with babies, but if I can avoid the risk of a parent who lets their child run amuck, I\u2019m happy to take advantage,\u201d Rahat Ahmed, a passenger who has flown with Japan Airlines, told USA Today. \u201cAnd when you have transoceanic flights, you want greater certainty.\u201d\n\nOne particularly incensed flier noted that airlines should go even further and set age restrictions on flying.\n\nI\u2019ve been saying for ages we need a 21+ or 18+ only flight. I would gladly pay a fee for such a flight. \u2014 Tarek Haidar (@TarekHaidar) September 26, 2019\n\nSome people say they want babies prohibited from flying altogether\n\nOther people noted that air travel is a form of public transportation, and that passengers simply have to figure out how to cope with some inconveniences, which come with that.\n\nSounds like you survived. However, I think if you have that much of an issue with travelling next to babies then you should consider coughing up for private. You realise you\u2019re using public transport, right? \u2014 jonjparr (@jonjparr) September 26, 2019\n\nBesides the seat map feature, Japan Airlines also offers families accommodations that could make traveling with babies a little easier. The airline rents car seats free of charge, serves juice, offers warm water for heating up bottles, and has a selection of toys for children, among other items.\n\nOther airlines have also introduced offerings that could make traveling with children more comfortable, too.\n\nLast year, Air New Zealand announced that it would be building on its \u201cskycouch\u201d feature. That\u2019s a row of three seats in the economy section, which turns into a couch, so passengers can lay down. The airline then added on a harness and belt, which would allow infants to rest next to their parents for the entirety of a flight.\n\n\u201cParents can relax while their children are able to have their own space and flat area to play without interrupting other passengers,\u201d Anita Hawthorne, Air New Zealand\u2019s general manager of customer experience, said in a statement.\n\nRead more:\n\n11 tips for making traveling with a baby easier\n\n7 times flight attendants went above and beyond for their passengers\n\nWatch a flight attendant save the day by singing to a crying baby on a long-haul flight", "description": "Business Insider - Japan Airlines's new feature shows passengers where children between the ages of 8 days and 2 years will be sitting on the plane..
