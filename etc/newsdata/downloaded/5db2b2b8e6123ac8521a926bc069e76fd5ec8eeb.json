I\u2019ve never come across so much racism as when I moved to Wales.\u201d\n\nHeidi Mirza, a visiting professor of race, faith and culture at Goldsmiths, University of London, said the EHRC\u2019s inclusion of anti-British sentiment watered down the impact of racism on people of colour.\n\n\u201cAnti-black, anti-Asian and Islamophobic and antisemitic racism is on a different scale to the anti-English sentiment,\u201d she said. \u201cThe experience that the Scottish and the Welsh students might experience will not equate to what skin colour and visible difference means to students on campus.\u201d\n\nFope Olaleye, the black students\u2019 officer at the National Union of Students, said the EHRC had ignored pleas made at a roundtable event with the inquiry team earlier this year to exclude anti-white harassment from their report.\n\nShe tweeted: \u201cI remember sitting at one of the round tables and a bunch of students and myself had to explain in excruciatingly detail that \u2018anti-white prejudice\u2019 should have no place in a report on racial harassment but I see we were not listened to.\u201d\n\nShe later added: \u201cThere was a definite tension with the students in the room who were concerned by how they were defining racism in the report and many of us pressed and challenged it.\u201d\n\nHowever, Rebecca Hilsenrath, the EHRC chief executive, denied that including anti-white harassment minimised racism against black and minority ethnic staff and students.\n\nShe said: \u201cYou\u2019re talking about people\u2019s thresholds to life and to employment and to future economic wellbeing. It may be because you\u2019re black or because you\u2019re Welsh in an English university. But often these things are cumulative. You\u2019re away from home and still a young person. And it\u2019s difficult to argue that there are different grades of racism in that sense because clearly we\u2019re looking at an objectively tough outcome for people in terms of what the impact is.\u201d\n\nBut Priyamvada Gopal, a reader in the faculty of English at Cambridge University, said this was a false equivalence because it ignored the political and historical context of racism in the UK. She added: \u201cAnti-English sentiment in Wales is emphatically not the same as targeting or disadvantaging black people as a vulnerable minority.\u201d", "description": "Academics and student leaders accuse equalities watchdog of drawing a false equivalence", "authors": ["David Batty", "Ilyas Nagdee", "Clive Nwonka"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73b1219776db479a8033557746e44e4693189d43/326_329_4570_2742/master/4570.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7bd85abd9279ff86aa0a0c7826e029ae", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
