He is an unbelievable cricketer.\n\n\"I was happy with Marco Jansen, who made his debut, and then also another young man batting out of position, Raynard van Tonder, went well too. So, the future of Knights cricket is looking bright.\"\n\nFirst-class debutant Coetzee finished with a match haul of six wickets, four of those in the second innings, Jansen claimed three wickets and contributed a total of 41 runs, spinner Shaun von Berg nabbed six wickets as well as scores of 19 and 61. Van Tonder hit scores of 52 and nine.\n\nKruger believes there is plenty for his side to now build on against their opponents from the coast.\n\n\"We played them in the pre-season up in Port Shepstone, so we know what they're about. They're a little bit inexperienced in terms of their bowling attack, so it's going to be different compared to playing them in the past,\" he added.\n\n\"Also, with Imraan (Khan) now as their new coach, so it will be different to previous games. But knowing their never-say-die attitude, you always know it's going to be a difficult game against them.\"\n\nKhan, meanwhile, would have been disappointed by the way the Dolphins capitulated in their season-opener against the Titans.\n\nThey looked on course to save the game on the final day but lost their last six wickets for a poor 37 runs.\n\nThe new coach is hoping for better in the Free State. \"We played a few pre-season games against the Knights, so we have an idea of who they have in their side and know them fairly well,\" he added.\n\n\"They are a good team, but every team at franchise level is a good side. We have to make sure that we put together four solid days of cricket.\"\n\n- Cricket South Africa", "description": "Coach Alan Kruger is excited about the future of the Knights following their strong start to the 2019/20 4-Day Domestic Series campaign.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8718/ae4714639ae0461580abd7c17afe5cfc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
