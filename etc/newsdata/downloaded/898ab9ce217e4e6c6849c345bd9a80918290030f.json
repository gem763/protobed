It wasn't long before big names, including Dwayne (The Rock) Johnson and Michelle Obama, made appearances on her channel.\n\nA Little Late with Lilly Singh airs at 1:35 a.m. on NBC. (Evan Agostini/Invision/Associated Press)\n\n\"She essentially has been doing the job on YouTube for like the last 10 years,\" said John Irwin, the executive producer of A Little Late with Lilly Singh, in an interview with CBC News.\n\nThat experience self-producing sketches and engaging interviews makes her a natural fit to host a talk show, he added.\n\nIrwin said he first learned of Singh a few years ago, because his daughter used to watch her videos.\n\n\"YouTube and all of these various platforms have opened the door for basically \u2026 anybody to be a star. There's just so many ways to now find new talent,\" he said. \"It's going to be interesting to watch how our business continues to morph.\"\n\nJohn Irwin is an executive producer with A Little Late with Lilly Singh. (CBC)\n\nSingh's talent and charisma sets her apart from traditional comedians who enter late-night and struggle to find their sweet spot, said Irwin, who has worked for Saturday Night Live's Lorne Michaels, as well as produced for Conan O'Brien and Mad TV.\n\n\"There's just that, like, uncomfortableness, where you're watching the host trying to procure an interview, and feel natural and be funny \u2014 and Lilly just, like, had it.\"\n\nSingh's first episode Monday featured comedians and stars of The Office, Rainn Wilson and Mindy Kaling. Saturday Night Live funnyman Kenan Thompson, sitcom starTracee Ellis Ross and comedian Chelsea Handler also made appearances.\n\nSingh is pictured with NBC colleagues and fellow late-night hosts Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers. (Andrew Lipovsky/NBC)\n\nWhile A Little Late boasts a gender-balanced and inclusive writer's room, another distinct feature is Singh's decision to steer away from politics \u2014 a topic that dominates late-night TV.\n\n\"[It's] sort of a refreshing sort of stance right out of the gate, because I think you can turn on any one of these shows right now and, for the most part, you're getting the same messaging every single day,\" said Irwin.\n\nMarty Younge, a Toronto-based arts and culture writer, has been watching Singh's career over the years and says her versatility and existing fan base is a huge plus for NBC.\n\n\"She has tremendous crossover potential, because she's already demonstrated, as a Youtuber, the ability to make a lot of content \u2026 content that resonates with a large fan base and a younger fan base that is advantageous to them.\"\n\nMarty Younge is a Toronto-based arts and culture writer. (Sharon Wu/CBC)\n\nYounge also points to the changing nature of late-night TV, with hosts creating catchy, viral videos that live beyond the early-morning audience and rack up millions of views online. It's likely another reason NBC plans to make sure A Little Late has a strong online presence.\n\n\"Who better to make that digital content other than Lilly Singh?\" she said.\n\nStill, Singh, who is used to working with a small team, will have to adapt to performing in front of a studio audience and working with a large team of writers. \"It will be interesting to see how she transitions into the new medium without alienating her old fans,\" said Younge.\n\nOne of the first examples of someone who has successfully made the transition from YouTube to mainstream television is Emmy-nominated actress Issa Rae.\n\nRae is the star, executive producer and writer of HBO's Insecure, now headed into its fourth season. But Rae got her start on YouTube, where she launched her comedy web-series Awkward Black Girl in 2011.\n\nIssa Rae first drew attention with her YouTube series Awkward Black Girl.

(AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe show soon caught the attention of comedian and producer Larry Wilmore, who gave Rae her first break and helped her write and create her first TV pilot.\n\n\"I'm here because the internet,\" Rae said in an interview with CBC News, talking about her unconventional path. \"There wasn't a blueprint for getting your show on television.\"\n\nWatch Issa Rae talk about paving a new path in Hollywood:\n\nThe actress, creator of Insecure and executive producer of Black Lady Sketch show talks about making her own way, representation and how the Internet is giving creative people more opportunities than ever. 2:54\n\nSince the success of Insecure, Rae has starred in a number of film projects, including Little and The Hate U Give. She's also the executive producer behind HBO's A Black Lady Sketch Show, a sketch-comedy late-night series that features a black female director, cast, and writer's room. It was recently renewed for a second season.\n\nRae says it's inspiring to see how talent born out of the digital space can break barriers in film and television today.\n\n\"I see a lot of leaders, I see a lot of people opening doors,\" she said. \"I see us taking the reins on a lot of our content.\"", "description": "Lilly Singh, Issa Rae both got their start on YouTube, carving out an unconventional path to mainstream success on their own.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5287302.1568858201!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/a-little-late-with-lilly-singh.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
