The Fed was unclear about further rate cuts, but the ECB hit the markets with enough stimulus to suggest it was out of bullets. Meanwhile, Swiss National Bank (SNB), Bank of England (BOE) and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) policymakers decided to sit on their hands and watch how their domestic economies unfold given the outside threat of a global economic slowdown.\n\nThe SNB left its key policy rate and expansionary monetary policy unchanged, but said it \u201cremains willing to intervene in the foreign exchange market as necessary.\u201d The BOE held its policy rate unchanged at 0.75% with a unanimous vote. The BOJ kept monetary policy on hold but hinted at possible action in October.\n\nSwiss National Bank\n\nThe SNB left its base rate unchanged while cutting growth and inflation view. In doing so, it said it \u201cremains willing to intervene in the foreign exchange market as necessary.\u201d\n\nThe SNB also said, \u201cNegative interest and the willingness to intervene are important in order to counteract the attractiveness of Swiss Franc investments and thus ease pressure on the currency. In this way, the SNB stabilizes price developments and supports economic activity.\u201d\n\nThe SNB also lowered its conditional inflation forecast for the current year to 0.4% from 0.6% in the previous quarter, and its growth forecast was cut to between 0.5% and 1% for 2019 as a whole, compared to around 1.5% in June.\n\nBank of England\n\nThe BOE surprised no one when it held its policy rate unchanged at 0.75% in a unanimous vote. Its asset purchase facility remained steady at 435 billion British Pounds as well.\n\nBOE policymakers also reiterated their view that leaving the EU without an exit deal would slow growth and raise rates. They also warned that another delay to Britain\u2019s departure date could lead to further economic weakness.\n\n\u201cIt is possible that political events could lead to a further period of entrenched uncertainty about the nature of, and the transition to, the United Kingdom\u2019s eventual future trading relationship with the European Union,\u201d the BOE said in a press release.\n\n\u201cThe longer those uncertainties persist, particularly in an environment of weaker global growth, the more likely it is that demand growth will remain below potential, increasing excess supply.\u201d\n\nBank of Japan\n\nThe BOJ kept monetary policy on hold but hinted at possible action in October. Policymakers held overnight interest rates at minus 0.1 percent, its target for 10-year bond yields at around zero percent, and the pace of its asset purchases at 80 trillion Yen ($740 billion) a year.\n\nThe BOJ\u2019s board voted for the decision by a majority of 7-2, with the dissents coming from policymakers who wanted greater stimulus.\n\nCentral bankers also gave an explicit warning that it was concerned about risks to the economic recovery and promised a review at its next meeting, after Japan\u2019s consumption tax rises from 8 percent to 10 percent at the end of this month.\n\n\u201cWith the slowdown in overseas economies continuing and downside risks on the increase, we judged it\u2019s becoming necessary to pay closer attention to the possibility of losing momentum towards our price stability goal,\u201d said Haruhiko Kuroda, BOJ Governor, in a press conference after the decision.\n\n\u201cBearing that in mind, we\u2019ll re-examine trends in activity and prices at our next meeting, when we publish our economic outlook report.\u201d\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n\nMore From FXEMPIRE:", "description": "The SNB left its base rate unchanged while cutting growth and inflation view.
