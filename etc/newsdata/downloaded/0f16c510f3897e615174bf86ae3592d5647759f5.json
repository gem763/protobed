The deal is already hugely controversial and has been rejected both by opposition parties in London and Johnson's governing partners in Northern Ireland.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the deal and its chances of ever coming into force.\n\nThe Brexit 'backstop' has been scrapped\n\nTheresa May and Boris Johnson REUTERS/Leon Neal/Pool\n\nThe controversial so-called \"backstop\", which would have kept the whole of the UK bound in the EU's customs union indefinitely, has been scrapped by Johnson.\n\nThe backstop was deeply unpopular with Conservative MPs who believed it would have kept the UK in the EU in all but name. Johnson's success in removing it will mean he should secure a lot more support from his party when it comes to a vote on Saturday.\n\nWe now have a Northern Ireland-only backstop\n\nUnder the terms of Johnson's new deal Northern Ireland will formally leave the EU Customs Union with the rest of the UK.\n\nHowever, there will be a \"special arrangement\" for Northern Ireland, with the province remaining subject to EU regulations in certain areas, including on goods, agriculture, VAT, excise duties, and state aid rules.\n\nThis means there will be a new border on the Irish Sea\n\nThe deal means there will be no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.\n\nBut it also means there will need to be a new border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom in the Irish Sea, covering customs and regulations.\n\nThis will lead to big new costs for trade on both sides of the United Kingdom and is opposed by Johnson's governing partners the Democratic Unionist Party.\n\nRead more: Boris Johnson has finally agreed a Brexit deal with the EU\n\nRead more: Boris Johnson's own official government figures shows his Brexit deal will make British people much poorer\n\nWill the deal pass?\n\nJohnson has secured a series of concessions from the EU that should help him win support from former opponents of May's Brexit deal.\n\nThe removal of the backstop will assuage the fears of some, if not all, pro-Brexit Conservative MPs. The Northern Irish assembly veto will also persuade some of those who were worried about a deal being imposed on the province.\n\nThe suggestion, contained in the accompanying political declaration, that the UK will retain a \"level playing field\" with EU rules and regulations could also persuade some opposition Labour MPs to back the deal.\n\nHowever, the lack of a legally binding commitment on this (as opposed to May's deal) means he will struggle to win the vast majority of potentially sympathetic Labour MPs over.\n\nThis combined with the continuing opposition of the DUP, who say they will be \"unable to support these proposals in Parliament,\" means that Johnson's prospects of passing the deal look very slim.\n\nWhy do the DUP object to the deal?\n\nBoris Johnson and Arlene Foster Reuters The DUP principally objects to the proposals because it is a unionist party, meaning it opposes any barriers being erected between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.\n\nThey said Johnson's plan to subject Ireland to EU customs rules would \"undermine the integrity of the Union.\"\n\nThe party's other objection relates to the so-called \"consent mechanism\" which would allow Northern Ireland's politicians to approve or veto the new backstop arrangements which would apply to Ireland.\n\nUnder the plan, Northern Ireland would have no choice but to enter the new backstop once the transition period ends in two years.\n\nThe province would have the chance to reject the arrangement after four years, but would require a two-year notice period before it expired.\n\nThe DUP demanded a veto on the plan, which was rejected. Instead, the Northern Irish assembly as a whole will decide how to vote, meaning republican parties \u2014 who are politically opposed to the DUP \u2014 will have to give consent to arrangements as well.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nJeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson Getty Johnson will now hold a vote on the deal in the UK Parliament on Saturday. The vote looks unlikely to pass as things stand, for all of the reasons listed above.\n\nIf he loses, as appears likely, Johnson will then be obliged under the terms of a law passed last month, to seek a three month extension from the EU.\n\nThis will be politically very difficult for Johnson, who has repeatedly insisted that Britain will leave the EU on October 31 \"do or die.\"\n\nWill the EU agree an extension?\n\nSpeaking alongside Johnson on Thursday, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said that there would be \"no need for any kind of prolongation\" if MPs back a deal.\n\nThis came close to the UK government's hopes that the EU would help Johnson turn Saturday's vote in the UK Parliament into a \"deal or no deal\" issue.\n\nHowever, Juncker stopped short of saying that the EU would reject a request to delay, meaning a vote against the deal would still likely lead to an extension.\n\nElection or referendum\n\nIf and when an extension is agreed, the UK would then face the decision of what to do next in order to finally break the Brexit deadlock.\n\nWith no apparent majority for a deal, the UK parliament would then have to decide whether to hold a general election, which some opposition parties have signaled they would support.\n\nIf Johnson were to win a majority in that election then the current deal could then pass. Were he to lose however, then the prospect of MPs instead moving towards backing a second referendum on Brexit would quickly loom into view.", "description": "Here is everything you need to know about Boris Johnson's new Brexit deal which he has agreed with the EU.", "authors": ["Thomas Colson", "Adam Bienkov"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da8685bcc4a0a2fb6733d28?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
