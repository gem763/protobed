Players also are off Tuesday. They are expected to return midday Thursday.\n\n\"We'll have our work in,\" Marrone said. \"I'm not concerned about that.\"\n\nMarrone said the team got \"quite a bit\" of the game plan for the opener installed last week, making any weather-related adjustments relatively easier.\n\n\"Most of the work is done, which not to say, 'If there's ever a good time,'\" Marrone said. \"But in the beginning you have a chance to have more done than, obviously, if something happened during the middle of a season.\"\n\nThe Jaguars were able to secure a block of hotel rooms for players, coaches, staff and families in case they needed to evacuate. Some coastal areas near Jacksonville already are under mandatory evacuation orders.\n\nMarrone said there have been internal discussions about possibly needing to move practices slated for later in the week out of Jacksonville, but added there are no plans to do so until the hurricane gets closer.\n\n\"People who have been through this before know that things can change and you have to be ready,\" Marrone said. \"There's been a lot of discussions about a lot of different things. I think the first thing was, the priority was, to make sure everyone's safe and have a plan, and then once we know that everyone is safe and has a plan of what they're doing. Then I think we'll just take things as they come.\"\n\nThe Jaguars have dealt with hurricanes before. Recently, too.\n\nThey were forced to stay two extra nights in Houston following the 2017 season opener because of Hurricane Irma.\n\nDorian hovered over the Bahamas on Monday, pummeling the islands with sustained winds in excess of 150 mph.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center in Miami extended watches and warnings across the Florida and Georgia coasts. Forecasters expected Dorian to stay just off shore, but caution that a small deviation could draw the storm's dangerous core toward land.", "description": "The Jacksonville Jaguars will have one less day to prepare for their season opener.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/NFL-Doug-Marrone.jpg"}
