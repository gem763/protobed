[Photo provided to chinadaily.com.cn]\n\nSpanish artist Nuria Carrasco specializes in creating fake magazines that look very much like genuine high-brow publications.\n\nThe 57-year-old has received widespread critical acclaim since 2013 when she published the first fake magazine.\n\nWorks from her Fake Magazines project are on display at the Cervantes Institute in Beijing, as part of an ongoing exhibition entitled Original or Copy?.\n\nVowei, Carrasco's latest work \u2013 the centerpiece of her Beijing show \u2013 focuses on Chinese millennials, the children of first-generation Chinese immigrants living and working in Madrid.\n\nCarrasco in 2018 copied both the title and format of global fashion trendsetter Vogue for her work titled Vowei.\n\nSpanish artist Nuria Carrasco (right) is at a roundtable prior to the opening of Fake Magazines held at the Cervantes Institute in Beijing, Sept 27, 2019.

Apart from Chiu, a dozen Chinese millennials from the Spanish capital appear in the publication.\n\n\"The younger Chinese in Madrid are so different from their parents, which impressed me deeply and inspired me to showcase their lives through my art,\" said Carrasco during an interview with China Daily Website.", "description": "Spanish artist Nuria Carrasco specializes in creating fake magazines that look very much like genuine high-brow publications.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/12/5da183dea310cf3e97a0e8af.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
