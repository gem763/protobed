A further 31 people were injured.\n\nIn his written determination following five months of oral evidence in a fatal accident inquiry, the sheriff principal Craig Turnbull said: \u201cCaptain Traill consciously took a risk in proceeding on the basis that the low fuel warnings were in some way erroneous (when they were not). That decision had fatal consequences.\u201d\n\nTurnbull added: \u201cThe central issue was why Captain Traill allowed the supply tanks to deplete to the point that they did when there was more than sufficient usable fuel available to him in the main tank to allow [the helicopter] to return safely to [base].\u201d\n\nHe said it was clear from the evidence that the accident was caused by Traill\u2019s failure to ensure that at least one of the fuel transfer pump switches was set to on.\n\nThe inquiry heard that the helicopter\u2019s engines flamed out sequentially as a result of fuel starvation while the craft was airborne.\n\nTurnbull found that there was enough time between the first and second engine flame-outs for Traill to have switched on the fuel transfer pumps.\n\nHe said he did not believe he could offer guidance to prevent further deaths occurring in similar circumstances, because the particular circumstances of this crash \u201cappear to be unique\u201d. He said: \u201cHad Captain Traill performed the actions set out in the pilot\u2019s checklist, the accident would not have happened.\u201d\n\nThose who were in the helicopter were Traill, 51, PC Tony Collins, 43, and PC Kirsty Nelis, 36. The seven Clutha customers who were killed were Gary Arthur, 48, Joe Cusker, 59, Colin Gibson, 33, Robert Jenkins, 61, John McGarrigle, 58, Samuel McGhee, 56, and Mark O\u2019Prey, 44.\n\nWitnesses told the inquiry that they heard a spluttering and grinding noise before the helicopter fell.\n\nThe inquiry, roughly equivalent to an inquest, was charged with establishing what caused the fatal crash and how the victims died. It took place in a temporary court at Hampden Park football stadium to accommodate scores of witnesses, aviation experts and family members. Breaks in the hearings were scheduled to fit around football matches and concerts.\n\nAn Air Accidents Investigations Branch (AAIB) report published in 2015 found two fuel supply switches were off and the pilot did not follow emergency procedures after a fuel warning in the cockpit.\n\nThe Crown Office, Scotland\u2019s prosecution authority, ruled there was not enough evidence to justify criminal proceedings. The police interviewed 2,000 witnesses and amassed 1,400 pieces of evidence for the FAI.", "description": "Fatal accident inquiry in Glasgow finds pilot David Traill \u2018consciously took a risk\u2019", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96411c337c3e8759f1ea309eed6d0c29a142a6ad/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ba1bcac3abbe0357b1d649712df21b28", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
