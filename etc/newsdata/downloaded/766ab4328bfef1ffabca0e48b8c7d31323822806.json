Adam Schiff, D-Calif., ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, speaks after a closed meeting on Capitol Hill, Tuesday, June 6, 2017, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nThe Volker testimony has now been released and once again, we find that the Democrats\u2019 version of the facts is false.\n\nThat fact explains why Republicans yesterday said there was no case after hearing his testimony and why Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) ran scurrying away from reporters refusing to comment.\n\nThe full transcript pretty much blows their theory of the case for impeachment out of the water.\n\nKurt Volker was a U.S. diplomatic envoy to Ukraine for two years. He said that contrary to the whistleblower complaint there was never any effort to get Ukraine to dig up dirt on Hunter or Joe Biden.\n\nFrom The Federalist:\n\n\u201cAs you will see from the extensive text messages I am providing, which convey a sense of real-time dialogue with several different actors, Vice President Biden was never a topic of discussion,\u201d he said. Volker testified that he never even mentioned a delay on U.S. military assistance to Ukrainian officials until late August, when news reports indicated that funding had been put on hold. Volker\u2019s statement directly undercuts claims that the funding was part of a deliberate quid pro quo meant to force the Ukrainians to take certain actions in order for the military aids to be released.\n\nVolker\u2019s testimony also reflected badly on Democrats. Volker said that Trump didn\u2019t have the best view of the Ukraine because of their involvement in allegedly helping the Democrats undermine him during the 2016 election and Trump was not happy with corruption in the country.\n\nVolker testified that he believed the allegations of Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections on behalf of the Democrats were \u201cplausible.\u201d\n\nHe said on the other hand that no one on the Trump team was trying to do that in the 2020 election. \u201cThe point about Ukraine avoiding anything that could play into U.S. elections in 2020 is a message that I know our Charg\u00e9 in Ukraine, Amb. Bill Taylor, reinforced in other meetings,\u201d Volker asserted.\n\nHe said that he was not on the Ukraine phone call being looked at, but that overall it was a \u201cgood\u201d call and in no way was there any quid pro quo or linkage of aid related to the Bidens.\n\n\u201cAll said it was a good, congratulatory call, that they discussed the importance of fighting corruption and promoting reform in Ukraine, and that President Trump reiterated his invitation to President Zelensky to visit the White House,\u201d he testified. \u201cI was not made aware of any reference to Vice President Biden or his son, which I only learned about when the transcript of the call was released on September 25, 2019.\u201d\n\nSo if he didn\u2019t even know Biden was mentioned he couldn\u2019t really be helping to push for an investigation, blowing another whistleblower claim the Volker helped demands to look into Hunter Biden. The testimony also kills the whistleblower claim that aid was held up because they didn\u2019t even know about it, so it couldn\u2019t be any pressure. It wasn\u2019t public until August.\n\nLooks like Schiff and the other Democrats are flailing desperately, because their case is going down in flames.", "description": "Volker Testimony Released, Blows Impeachment Narrative and Schiff\u2019s Story Out of the Water", "authors": ["Nick Arama", "Alex Parker", "Sarah Lee", "Sister Toldjah", "Posted At Pm On October"], "top_image": "https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ap-adam-schiff.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
