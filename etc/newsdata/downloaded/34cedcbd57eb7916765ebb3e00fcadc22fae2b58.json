Paul Getty Museum in the Brentwood section of L.A., the Associated Press reported. \u201cSome 2.2 million people lacked electricity after California\u2019s biggest utility, Pacific Gas & Electric PCG, +16.77%, shut it off over the weekend in the northern part of the state to prevent its equipment from sparking blazes during windy weather,\u201d it reported. Service has since been restored to hundreds of thousands of customers.\n\nHowever, a wildfire or volcanic eruption can be less complex to process \u2014 at least from an insurance perspective.\n\nSee more: Footage from Florida Panhandle shows the incredible force of Hurricane Michael\n\nFor homeowners, what precisely caused the damage to their home will prove important for insurance purposes, because coverage will depend on how the damage was caused. During a tornado, for instance, if high winds cause roof damage that leads to significant water accumulation within the house, most insurance policies will cover it. But if a nearby river crests because of the storm\u2019s heavy rainfall and then causes flooding, the damage to homes will only be covered if the owners have flood insurance.\n\nDamage caused by flooding isn\u2019t covered by standard home insurance policies. Only homeowners who bought separate flood insurance for their homes were covered if water from Florence damaged their house. And there weren\u2019t many people in that boat. Hurricane Florence caused between $20 billion and $30 billion in losses to both commercial and residential properties last year across the Southeast due to flood and wind damages, according to estimates from property data firm CoreLogic CLGX, -1.71%.\n\nIn volcanic eruptions, damage caused by lava flows or resulting fires is covered by a standard homeowner\u2019s policy.\n\nWindstorm and hurricane deductibles vary from policy to policy, but are often assessed as a percentage of the home\u2019s overall value. Buying additional insurance policies for disasters like floods and earthquakes might seem like a no-brainer, but it\u2019s an expensive proposition.\n\n\u201cThey have to do a cost benefit analysis,\u201d said Michael Crowe, co-founder and CEO of Clearsurance, a site where consumers can review and compare insurance companies.\n\nThe average annual premium for a policy through the National Flood Insurance Program was $699. But flood insurance premiums can easily cost thousands of dollars in regions that are determined to be at the highest risk of flooding.\n\nIn some coastal states and counties, including in Florida and Texas, homeowners may need to purchase separate windstorm coverage. Coverage for other disasters operates similarly. In volcanic eruptions, damage caused by lava flows or resulting fires is covered by a standard homeowner\u2019s policy, but if the eruption causes seismic activity, homeowners will not be reimbursed unless they have purchased a separate earthquake policy.\n\nWhat is covered under a standard homeowner\u2019s insurance policy\n\nSome natural disasters are almost always covered by homeowner\u2019s insurance, including wildfires and hail storms. But other natural disasters are never or rarely covered under a standard homeowner\u2019s insurance policy. They generally fall into two categories: floods and \u201cearth movements.\u201d\n\nThe first category comprises disasters caused by rising water, which includes everything from floods caused by extensive rainfall and hurricane-induced storm surges to dam failures and tsunamis. \u201cEarth movements\u201d include disasters such as earthquakes, landslides and sinkholes.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: How to find a contractor after a hurricane\n\nUnfortunately, many Americans are unaware that these disasters are not covered by a standard homeowner\u2019s policy, according to the Insurance Information Institute.\n\nCertain natural disaster typically aren\u2019t covered because of the level of the destruction they create, said Lynne McChristian, a spokeswoman for the Insurance Information Institute and executive director of the Center for Risk Management Education and Research at Florida State University.\n\nWith these disasters, \u201cthe damage is usually so widespread, and it\u2019s typically a total loss,\u201d McChristian said. \u201cInsurance companies can\u2019t price it appropriately to make it a viable line of business for them.\u201d\n\nAre you covered with a standard homeowner's insurance policy? Typically covered Sometimes or partially covered Rarely covered Tornado Hurricane Flooding (including storm surge and tsunamis) Wildfire Volcano Earthquakes Hail storm Sinkhole Mud- and landslides Blizzard or ice storm Sewer backup\n\nHow to get to the front of the line when you need help\n\nRegardless of whether or not a homeowner has insurance coverage for a specific natural disaster, getting their property assessed is critical in beginning the rebuilding process.\n\nFollowing a natural disaster, a consumer\u2019s first step should be to contact their insurance agent or company immediately. That is critical because insurance claims are handled on a triage basis, McChristian said.\n\n\u201cThose with the most damage get to the front of the line because those people have the most need for recovery assistance,\u201d McChristian said.\n\nBy clarifying how to file a claim and conveying the state of their property, homeowners can improve the chances of having their case handled more quickly by their insurer. Homeowners should also learn the ins and outs of how to file their claim, including what information is needed and how long they have to file. Now is also the time to determine what their policy\u2019s deductible is.\n\nAlso see: What to do about your home and mortgage if you\u2019re hit by a disaster\n\nMake a head-start on assessing damage\n\nThe insurance company will send its own adjuster free of charge to inspect the property and assess the total cost of the damage. Homeowners can take steps to prepare for this by documenting what was damaged or destroyed by the natural disaster, getting bids from contractors and keeping track of receipts for any expenses they incur following the storm. Homeowners shouldn\u2019t hesitate to make temporary repairs to protect their property from further damage.\n\nHomeowners shouldn\u2019t hesitate to make temporary repairs to protect their property from further damage.\n\nA pricier option: Hire a third-party insurance adjuster to assess their property. Given the backlog insurers will experience following widespread disasters, it can take a while to receive a payout. To expedite this process, a homeowner can choose to hire an independent or public adjuster to assess their property.\n\nStudies have shown that hiring public adjusters leads to higher insurance settlements. But these professionals don\u2019t come cheap \u2014 they generally charge a fee that\u2019s anywhere from 10% to 20% of the insurance settlement. And it\u2019s critical to hire a reputable professional. (Check the websites of the National Association of Independent Insurance Adjusters and the National Association of Public Insurance Adjusters.)\n\nAlways have someone look at damaged property\n\nAnd even if homeowners aren\u2019t covered for flood insurance, they should still have their insurance company assess their property and whatever damage occurred.\n\nCrowe has experienced this firsthand. In 2006, an extended period of rainfall in Newburyport, Mass., where Crowe and his family lived, caused their newly remodeled basement to flood. However, their insurance policy did not include flood coverage. He thought he would have to pay for all the damage.\n\nBut when insurance adjusters inspected the property, they noted that the basement\u2019s sump pump \u2014 designed to prevent water accumulation \u2014 had failed.\n\nIn other words, he got lucky. The insurance company categorized the damage as the result of a mechanical failure rather than a flood, so the company covered the damage.\n\n\u201cI thought to myself, \u2018I\u2019m really fortunate to have insider knowledge,\u2019\u201d Crowe said.\n\nThe government provides flood insurance\n\nIn the case of insurance for flooding, the federal government has stepped in. The National Flood Insurance Program was created in 1968 after insurance companies struggled to pay off claims following a slew of floods in the 1950s. Homeowners have the option to buy flood insurance through this program or to get a private insurance policy. In certain cases, homeowners may be required to purchase flood insurance by their mortgage lender if their home is located within a flood zone.\n\nPrivate flood insurance now accounts for roughly 15% of all flood premiums nationwide, according to the Insurance Journal. And for many homeowners, a policy from a private insurer rather than through the federal insurance program could be cheaper. One briefing from Milliman found that private flood policies would have lower premiums for 77% of all single-family homes in Florida, 69% in Louisiana and 92% in Texas.\n\nRead more: Congress just dodged hard decisions about flood insurance again\n\nEarthquakes\n\nSimilarly, homeowners will need to purchase a separate policy or a rider to their standard home insurance policy from a private insurer to be covered for an earthquake. California residents also have the option to purchase coverage through the California Earthquake Authority. That said, if an earthquake causes a house fire, some damage might be covered by the standard policy alone.\n\nSinkholes\n\nAs for sinkholes, coverage options vary from state to state. A standard home insurance policy may cover minor damage caused by a sinkhole \u2014 but catastrophic damage (generally defined as damage to more than half of the structure) is excluded. People can either get sinkhole insurance in the form of a standalone policy or an endorsement to the standard insurance policy, depending on where they live.\n\nTennessee and Florida require insurers to offer optional sinkhole coverage. Insurers in Florida are also required to provide insurance for \u201ccatastrophic ground cover collapse\u201d through their standard policies.\n\nRead more: Your easy step-by-step guide to paying off all kinds of debt\n\nDid the homeowner take care of the property?\n\nThe property\u2019s upkeep can also play a role in whether or not damage caused by a storm or other natural disaster is covered. For instance, if winter storms cause an ice dam to form on the roof of the home and the owner is not proactive about removing it, the insurer may choose to deny coverage for water damage.\n\nYou have some options if you skip insurance\n\nIf homeowners don\u2019t buy specialized insurance coverage and then get hit by some sort of disaster, they do have some options to offset their losses. They can get a grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency or a loan from the Small Business Administration.\n\n\u201cThose are not designed to bring you back to a pre-disaster condition \u2014 they\u2019re designed just to get you back on your feet,\u201d McChristian said. \u201cInsurance is designed to get you back to where you were before the disaster occurred.\u201d\n\nHow to decide whether you need coverage\n\nEarthquakes have caused damaged in all 50 states at some point since 1900, according to the Insurance Information Institute.\n\nFor starters, homeowners need to consider whether or not they are at risk. They should check government flood zone maps. They are generally available from county governments, or you can search by address on the FEMA website. But they aren\u2019t foolproof because they are only periodically updated.\n\nOther factors to consider include the property\u2019s elevation (if it\u2019s at or just a few feet above sea level it\u2019s more prone to flooding) and whether there has been a lot of construction in the area. This could displace vegetation that would soak up rainfall and prevent flooding.\n\nAs for earthquakes, homeowners shouldn\u2019t assume they\u2019re not at risk just because they don\u2019t live on the West Coast. Earthquakes have caused damaged in all 50 states at some point since 1900, according to the Insurance Information Institute (a trade group that of course has a vested interest in people getting insurance). And fracking for oil and natural gas has led to seismic activity in parts of the country that had never before experienced it.\n\nThis story was updated on Oct. 30, 2019.", "description": "Home insurance policies vary dramatically from wildfires to floods and hurricanes.", "authors": ["Jacob Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GQ335_natura_ZG_20180919125036.jpg", "published_at": "2018-09-19"}
