In a boost for Mr Johnson, no current Conservative MPs rebelled - although one, Caroline Spelman, appears to have abstained\n\nThe West Dorset MP was one of 21 Conservatives expelled from the party in September for not supporting Johnson's pledge to leave the EU on October 31 with or without a deal, and he has focused his parliamentary acumen on preventing a no-deal Brexit.\n\nLetwin criticised Johnson's bid to present lawmakers with a 'deal or no deal' choice.\n\n'I, despite my support for the prime minister's deal, do not believe that it is responsible to put the nation at risk by making that threat,' he told parliament during Saturday's three-hour debate.\n\nOliver Letwin (pictured left in the Commons today) tabled the extraordinary amendment to block the PM's crunch vote later. Former chancellor Ken Clarke (right) said he will back the deal when legislation comes before Parliament\n\nThe Remain voter's amendment withholds parliamentary approval of the Brexit deal until after legislation has been put on the statute book. It forces Boris Johnson to ask the EU to delay the UK's departure beyond October 31.\n\nIt would also robbed the Prime Minister of the chance to test the will of the House of Commons to see if a majority of MPs support his Brexit deal.\n\nSir Oliver has insisted that the move is just about bolstering protections against a No Deal split from the EU.\n\nBut his critics believe it is nothing less than a wrecking amendment designed to stop the UK leaving the EU.\n\nEducated at Eton and then Cambridge, the 63-year-old first entered politics as a member of Margaret Thatcher's policy unit in Number 10 in the 1980s.\n\nIn the 'Super Saturday' showdown in the House of Commons today, Boris Johnson complained he was being prevented from forcing a 'meaningful' decision by Letwin amendment\n\nHe was then first elected as the Tory MP for West Dorset in 1997 before making a rapid rise up the ranks, joining the opposition frontbench and eventually becoming shadow chancellor in 2003.\n\nHe became a key figure in David Cameron's administration, acting as the PM's 'fixer', after he helped to draw up the Tories' 2010 election manifesto.\n\nAfter being a constant in Mr Cameron's governments, Sir Oliver was then ousted from the frontbench by Theresa May when she became PM in 2016.\n\nSir Oliver is regarded as a 'big brain' in Whitehall circles and is viewed as a man who has a gift for creative thinking and problem solving.\n\nBut he has over the years developed a reputation as a hapless politician who has been prone to gaffes and finding himself in embarrassing situations.\n\nHe once unwittingly welcomed two burglars into his London home after they said they wanted to use the bathroom.\n\nHe was also once spotted discarding parliamentary papers into a bin in St James's Park.\n\nBefore the 2001 election he and his local challengers dressed up in togas for a debate.\n\nIn 2015 he apologised after it emerged he had blamed 'bad moral attitudes' in black inner-city communities for riots in the 1980s in a paper he had helped write.\n\nOutside of politics, Sir Oliver is married and has two children.\n\nHe is expected to stand down as an MP at the next election.\n\nSpeaker John Bercow has emerged as a parliamentary bete noir of Brexiteers. He was elected as Tory MP for Buckingham in 1997 but has been the Speaker - and therefore an independent - since 2009.\n\nHe has made a series of decisions that have infuriated Mr Johnson's Government and that of Theresa may before him.\n\nHe is due to stand down at the end of the month.\n\nEarlier this month he faced allegations of 'plotting' today after it emerged he met the EU parliament chief to discuss their 'shared' desire to avoid No Deal.\n\nDavid Sassoli revealed he held talks with Mr Bercow in London, telling MEPs they were on the 'same wavelength'.\n\nMr Sassoli said the pair agreed that the UK and EU Parliaments must have a key role in 'managing' the Brexit process.\n\n'We share an awareness that a chaotic exit of the UK from the EU would work to the detriment of citizens on both sides,' he said.\n\nBut the news sparked anger from Eurosceptics including Nigel Farage, who said it was a 'disgrace' that the president and the Speaker had 'agreed to work to prevent a clean break Brexit'.\n\n'What right does the Speaker have to do this?' he demanded.\n\nThe Speaker is meant to be an impartial referee of debates, but Mr Bercow has repeatedly been 'creative' with the rules to frustrate the government - saying his duty was to champion MPs against the executive.\n\nTheresa May's Brexit plans were thwarted partly as a result of his intervention, and last month a rebel law was passed ordering the PM to beg the EU for a Brexit extension if he has not secured a deal by October 19.\n\nMr Bercow was also at the centre of protests against the PM's decision to prorogue Parliament in the run-up to Brexit, saying it was 'not normal'.\n\nAt Tory conference last week, the current Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said he admired many of the things the Speaker had done in his 10-year tenure.\n\nBut he said Mr Bercow's 'recent mistakes' had brought the public standing of the House to 'the lowest point in modern history'.\n\nAllies of the PM have made clear he will not follow the convention that Commons Speakers are automatically elevated to the upper chamber when they resign.\n\nMr Bercow dramatically announced last month that he will stand down from the chair and as an MP on October 31 - symbolically choosing Boris Johnson's 'do or die' Brexit date.", "description": "Former Cabinet minister Sir Oliver Letwin continued his run of parliamentary scheming with his amendment that put the Prime Minister's withdrawal agreement in a legislative straight jacket.", "authors": ["David Wilcock", "Whitehall Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/17/19930430-0-image-a-48_1571501451648.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
