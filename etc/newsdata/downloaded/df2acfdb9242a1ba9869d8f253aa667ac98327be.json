When it is that way, he could wait and take it later but that\u2019s up to the ref.\n\n\u201cA lot of the penalty decisions, if you don\u2019t make it, you can\u2019t really go back and have it. But it's a work in progress and they definitely deserved their goal today.\u201d\n\nSolskjaer also pointed out his side might have had a penalty for a second half handball by Sead Kolasinac but United goalkeeper David de Gea admitted that United will not be a factor in the race for Champions League football if they fail to win such games.\n\nThe Spanish goalkeeper\u2019s side are in the midst of their worst start to a league season since 1989-90 and have scored seven goals in their last eight games since opening the campaign with a 4-0 win over Chelsea.\n\nDe Gea said: \u201cThey had good chance, we had good chances but we were playing at Old Trafford and we have to win these games if we want to finish in the top four.\n\n\u201cThis is Manchester United, we were playing at Old Trafford so we have to win these games.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWe have a young team but the lads have to read and play better than they are doing. We know we have to improve and we\u2019re working really hard to do it.\u201d\n\nArsenal manager Unai Emery believed a draw a fair result and praised 18-year-old Bukayo Saka\u2019s performance as the striker became the youngest player to appear in the fixture in the Premier League era.\n\nEmery said: \u201cHe\u2019s improving and he\u2019s helping us now as an important player and we\u2019re going to go with him.\n\n\u201cIt was a fair result for both teams and it could be a good point for us if we win on Saturday against Bournemouth at home.\u201d", "description": "Ole\u00a0Gunnar Solskjaer blamed assistant referee Scott Ledger for his part in Arsenal\u2019s equalising goal as Manchester United made their worst start to a season in 30 years.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/GusQYI.7VeXOZ_nL06uEsQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kDErU66b.fE23uUpKpjtSQ--~B/aD0xNjU1O3c9MjY0ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/92fad18beda78067f400dd762ba7a3c5", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
