But there\u2019s a good chance that, once investors digest the price hike and the doom-and-gloom predictions that it would be a \u201cgame changer,\u201d the stock market will resume its uptrend.\n\nThat\u2019s because many investors are interpreting recent events through the lens of years ago, when a higher oil price was indeed a bearish omen for the equity markets. But over the last decade, the relationship between oil CLV19, -1.46% and the stock market has been just the reverse.\n\nThis shift is clear in the accompanying chart, which plots the correlation coefficient for the trailing 60-month relationship between stocks and crude oil. If the two rose and fell in perfect lockstep, of course, that coefficient would be plus 1.0 \u2014 and minus 1.0 if stocks always rose when oil fell, and vice versa. A coefficient of zero would mean there is no detectable relationship one way or the other.\n\nNotice that, prior to the Great Financial Crisis a decade ago, the oil-stock correlation coefficient was predominantly negative. Since then, however, the correlation has been positive, and sometimes very much so.\n\nI am not the first person to note this shifting correlation, of course. Three years ago, in fact, former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke devoted a blog post to the subject.\n\nNew research, in the current issue of Investment Analysts Journal, provides insight into why stocks and oil are positive correlated at some times and negatively correlated at others. The authors \u2014 An-Sing Chen and Che-Ming Yang, both of the Department of Finance at Taiwan\u2019s National Chung Cheng University \u2014 find that there is a threshold oil price below which stocks and oil are positive correlated, and above which it is just the reverse.\n\nThe period the researchers analyzed ended in 2016, and they don\u2019t indicate what oil\u2019s threshold price would be today. I note, however, that over the last decade in which the oil-stock correlation has been positive, oil\u2019s average price has been above $70 per barrel. That\u2019s still higher than the price at which oil CL.1, -1.46% is now trading.\n\nWe can only speculate as to why the stock market responds differently when oil\u2019s price is above or below this threshold. One plausible theory is that the U.S. has become more energy self-sufficient. According to the Energy Information Administration, for example, the amount of oil and petroleum products the U.S. has imported, relative to the amount it has exported, has been declining steadily for many years. In some months, in fact, U.S. has been a net exporter of petroleum products.\n\nTo the extent the U.S. is a net exporter today, of course, then by definition a higher oil price will be a net positive for the U.S. economy as a whole. And insofar as imports and exports of petroleum products are in a rough balance, then there should be little net economic effect of a higher oil price.\n\nThe bottom line? Don\u2019t automatically assume that oil\u2019s price hike spells the end of the economic expansion or the bull market. It might actually keep both the economy and the bull running strong.\n\nMark Hulbert is a regular contributor to MarketWatch.
