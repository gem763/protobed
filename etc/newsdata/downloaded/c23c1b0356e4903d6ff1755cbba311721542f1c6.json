White House officials have said they are simply reviewing the issue to ensure the money is being spent in line with America\u2019s interests, but former officials and national security specialists are skeptical about the vague explanation.\n\nThe move has irked lawmakers and national security veterans, who argue that the United States must make a sustained commitment to countering Russia\u2019s military aggression in the region and show that it stands with Ukraine. Russia annexed the Crimea region of Ukraine in 2014.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Jeanne Shaheen, Dick Durbin and Richard Blumenthal, as well as Republican Sens. Rob Portman and Ron Johnson.\n\n\u201cU.S.-funded security assistance has already helped turn the tide in this conflict, and it is necessary to ensure the protection of the sovereign territory of this young country, going forward,\u201d they added.\n\nThe letter cites POLITICO\u2019s report that President Donald Trump asked his national security team to review the funding program, known as the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative. The funding was still on hold as of Tuesday morning, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\n\u201cThis funding is crucial to the long term stability of Ukraine and has the continued backing and approval of the U.S. Congress which appropriated these funds,\u201d the senators wrote. \u201cWe strongly urge you to direct the Department of Defense to obligate these funds immediately.\u201d\n\nA senior administration official told POLITICO in response to the senators\u2019 letter that \u201cthe president has made no secret when it comes to foreign assistance that U.S. interests abroad should be prioritized.\u201d The Defense Department said last week that it supports the aid package.\n\nTrump has repeatedly invoked his administration\u2019s support for Ukraine, both financially and militarily, as evidence that he is tough on Russia. The United States completed its shipment of Javelin anti-tank missiles to Ukraine last May, finalizing a sale that Trump approved in 2017. For the 2019 fiscal year, lawmakers allocated $250 million in security aid to Ukraine, including money for weapons, training, equipment and intelligence support. Of the funds, Congress set aside $50 million for weaponry.\n\nBut Trump, while meeting with world leaders at the Group of Seven last month, advocated for Russia\u2019s reinstatement to the group and blamed President Barack Obama, rather than Russian President Vladimir Putin, for Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea.\n\nVice President Mike Pence, meeting with Ukraine\u2019s president Vladimir Zelensky in Poland on Sunday, did not publicly address whether the administration plans to unfreeze the funding ahead of its expiration at the end of September. The funds can\u2019t be spent while they\u2019re under review. The account was originally created by defense policy legislation enacted in late 2015 to help Ukraine battle pro-Russian separatists in Crimea.\n\nPence reaffirmed U.S. support for \u201cthe territorial integrity of Ukraine\u201d and said the administration \u201cwill continue to stand with the people of Ukraine on your security, on territorial integrity, including Ukraine's rightful claim to Crimea.\u201d\n\nHe would not confirm that the hold on the aid package would be lifted, however, telling reporters that the administration is still evaluating where to send federal resources.", "description": "A group of Republicans and Democrats joined forces to express their concerns in a letter sent to the White House on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Natasha Bertrand"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/d9/01/010496b44f478e1a0cfdd95d472e/190903-ukraine-military-ap-773.jpg"}
