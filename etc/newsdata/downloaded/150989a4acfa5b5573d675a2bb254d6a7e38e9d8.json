He claims that the Republican Party is more concerned with protecting Jewish people at home and abroad. He also wants to stoke tensions between American Jews and American Muslims. He loves to attack the Democratic Congresswomen Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, among others, as anti-Semitic because of their positions on United States policy toward the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nOur survey research, however, indicates that the biggest threat to the rights of the Jewish people comes from homegrown American nativists. These people dislike all manner of groups they view as foreign to this country and our research shows that they are even more vehemently opposed to Muslims than they are to Jews . American Jews and American Muslims thus have a common adversary who are to be found, for the most part, among Mr. Trump\u2019s most committed supporters.\n\nOur claims are based on a poll we conducted in late 2018 with the help of YouGov, a survey research firm, that queried a 2,000-person, nationally representative sample of American adults.\n\nWe asked, \u201cHow important is it to you to protect the rights of the following groups of people living in the United States?\u201d We then mentioned 22 different groups, including Jews and Muslims. We also asked, \u201chow important do you think it is for the United States government to protect the rights of the following groups living outside of the U.S.?\u201d This time we asked about 16 different groups, once again including Jews and Muslims.", "description": "Homegrown nativists strongly dislike both groups, which ought to help them work toward mutual understanding.", "authors": ["James Ron", "Howard Lavine"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/24/opinion/24ronlavine1/24ronlavine1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
