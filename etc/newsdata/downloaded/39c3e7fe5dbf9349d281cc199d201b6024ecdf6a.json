But, we are in a substantially better position than we were a decade ago. I take that as a great win for us,\" Perry said.\n\nThe outgoing energy secretary was speaking to CNBC shortly before traveling to Saudi Arabia for the Future Investment Initiative (FII) next week.\n\nThe U.S. surpassed Russia in 2011 to become the world's largest producer of natural gas and surpassed Saudi Arabia in 2018 to become the world's largest producer of petroleum, according to the EIA.\n\n\"I don't think I've ever said that we are completely and absolutely independent and that we don't need anybody and thumb our nose at the rest of the world,\" he continued.\n\n\"We are very proud that American technology, American innovation has us at this position of being this number one producer of this product. But, arguing about whether or not we are completely independent or not, I try not to be subject to that.\"\n\nPerry told CNBC on Saturday that he would leave his post on December 1, with deputy energy secretary Dan Brouillette poised to take the reins.", "description": "The U.S. is in a \"substantially better position\" when compared to a decade ago, according to the departing energy secretary.", "authors": ["Sam Meredith"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106203425-1571996019247gettyimages-1180260324.jpeg?v=1571996074", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
