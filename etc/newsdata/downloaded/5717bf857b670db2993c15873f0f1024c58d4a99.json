Bush. \u201cYou can just feel there is a sense of disbelief. They don\u2019t know who will be subpoenaed next.\u201d\n\nThe first blow was the release of a rough transcript of the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in which the American president pressed for an investigation of the son of former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nIn the call, the president also disparaged the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, who was removed from her post in May amid a campaign coordinated by Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani.\n\nThursday saw the release of text messages between Ukraine special envoy Kurt Volker and two senior diplomats as they scrambled to accommodate Giuliani\u2019s campaign to leverage American support for Ukraine in a search for potential political dirt.\n\n\u201cThis is only the latest in a large number of very damaging things that have been done to the State Department,\u201d said Thomas Pickering, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and Russia under President George H.W. Bush. \u201cIt represents a new low in basically ignoring and indeed punishing the people who have made a professional commitment to the country and Constitution.\u201d\n\nWith Washington in tumult over the escalating impeachment inquiry, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo toured southeast Europe on Friday, trying to ignore the furor back home.\n\nHe did not respond to shouted questions on the topic from journalists at photo opportunities in Podgorica, Montenegro, and Ohrid, North Macedonia, and no questions were allowed at his scheduled press events in the two cities. His staff steadfastly refused to comment on the latest developments in the rapidly unfolding drama, including at a briefing for reporters at his last stop of the day in Athens.\n\nEarlier this week in Rome, Pompeo acknowledged for the first time that he had been on the July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelenskiy.\n\nHouse Democrats launched the impeachment probe over the Ukraine matter after a government whistleblower disclosed Trump\u2019s call with Zelenskiy and the push to have a foreign government interfere in U.S. elections by digging up dirt on Biden.\n\nTrump has sought, without evidence, to implicate Biden and his son Hunter in the kind of corruption that has long plagued Ukraine. Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company at the same time his father was leading the Obama administration\u2019s diplomatic dealings with Kyiv. Though the timing raised concerns among anti-corruption advocates, there has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either the former vice president or his son.\n\nTrump has had a tense relationship with the State Department since he took office, repeatedly proposing to slash its budget, leaving key posts unfulfilled and choosing political appointees over career foreign service officers for ambassadorships to a greater degree than other recent presidents have.\n\nHis ouster of U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, a respected career officer, and his dismissal of her as \u201cbad news\u201d in the call left many diplomats dismayed.\n\n\u201cThis is a workforce that already feels besieged and undercut and in a perpetual defensive crouch,\u201d said Derek Chollet, a former senior policy adviser in the Defense Department and State Department. \u201cThe lack of a vigorous defense of her is a signal that they are very vulnerable here. It just confirms their worst fears.\u201d\n\nConley, now a program director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the State Department had settled down a bit under Pompeo following the chaotic early part of the administration under former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.\n\nBut now, she said, diplomats are conflicted and confused because everything has happened outside normal channels, with no regard for long-held processes.\n\nConley said that during her tenure at the department, even when there were disagreements between senior leaders, \u201cthere was a respect for hierarchy and the process.\u201d And when something went wrong, there was a chain of command and a process that protected people.\n\nBut that has changed. \u201cNo one knows what\u2019s going to happen next,\u201d Conley said. \u201cThey\u2019re all trying their best, but no one is untouched, no one is unharmed.\u201d\n\nShe said foreign leaders who come to Washington can\u2019t make progress on important issues because the Ukraine furor overwhelms the conversation, as it did during a visit by the president of Finland earlier this week.\n\nOther former officials and diplomats say U.S. standing around the world has been weakened.\n\n\u201cEven a hint of the President using the power of his office to advance his personal interests in an upcoming domestic election will undermine the U.S. in diplomacy and military affairs significantly \u2014 especially with our NATO allies, who are following all of this closely with real concern,\u201d said James Stavridis, a retired Navy admiral who was the top NATO commander in Europe from 2009 to 2013.\n\n\u201cWe have come into a situation where not only unpredictability is the hallmark of the United States, but unreliability as well,\u201d Pickering said. \u201cThe wisdom and judgment that the United States was known for has been diminished.\u201d", "description": "The department is reeling from daily revelations in the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, according to former senior officials.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d988aa3200000f2004cf8c3.jpeg?cache=pj4tjjyutj&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
