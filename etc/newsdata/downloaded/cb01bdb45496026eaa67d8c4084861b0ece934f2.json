The defendants did not comply with the 30-day notices of plaintiff's intent to sue, which gives Mr. Regueiro the right to seek treble damages.\"\n\nLawsuits by Cuban-Americans became possible after President Donald Trump's administration lifted a long-standing suspension of the Helms Burton Act earlier this year.\n\nIt had been suspended by all previous US presidents to avoid causing friction with allies, such as the European Union, some of whom view it as overstepping American jurisdiction.\n\nIn May, oil giant ExxonMobil became the first US company to take advantage of the move, seeking $280 million compensation from two Cuban state-owned oil companies for \"unlawful trafficking\" of its assets on the island.\n\nThe Cuban government said it would defend itself in US court against the ExxonMobil claim.", "description": "The son of the former owner of Cuba's main airport has filed a lawsuit against American Airlines and South American carrier LATAM for profiting from property seized by Fidel Castro's government.
