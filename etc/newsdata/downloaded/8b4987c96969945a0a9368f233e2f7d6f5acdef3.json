She was ordered to leave the homestead in February this year.\n\n\u201cHer husband, Mr Jacob Zuma, did not [personally] instruct her to leave the homestead.\u201d\n\nHe said Ntuli-Zuma had offered her \u201cfull co-operation pertaining to the alleged investigation into this matter\u201d.\n\nEarlier this month, City Press and News24 reported that Ntuli-Zuma and various accomplices were on the radar of authorities.\n\nSoon afterwards, Roux issued a statement on behalf of Ntuli-Zuma in which he said she had denied involvement in, or knowledge of, any plot to poison her husband.\n\n\"Our client has not 'crumbled and confessed' to having any knowledge of any plot to poison her husband,\" Roux was quoted as saying in a News24 article at the time.\n\nSource: News24", "description": "President Jacob Zuma was not the one who told MaNtuli to leave the Nkandla homestead, according to a report on Sunday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5732/61cfc598bf2d4b0a8223b8339d501279.jpg", "published_at": "2015-08-17"}
