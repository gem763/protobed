It was 3 percent a week ago and 4.06 percent a year ago. The five-year adjustable rate average rose to 3.36 percent with an average 0.3 point. It was 3.3 percent a week ago and 3.93 percent a year ago.\n\nApparent headway in the U.S.-China trade discussions helped propel mortgage rates higher, said Matthew Speakman, a Zillow economist.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOptimism that recent signs of progress will result in the abandonment of proposed tariffs, due to be imposed October 1, pushed bond yields higher, and mortgage rates followed,\u201d he said.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury, which had fallen to 1.47 percent earlier this month, bounced back this week, rising to 1.75 percent on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cA heavy dose of generally strong economic data also contributed to a rebound in mortgage rates, particularly better-than-expected wage growth figures and an encouraging read on the services sector,\u201d Speakman said. \u201cThe strength of the consumer continues to propel the economy, so all eyes will be on the August retail sales report on Friday. A positive reading would inject the economy with even more optimism, and push rates even higher, ahead of next week\u2019s [Federal Reserve] meeting.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGeorge Ratiu, senior economist at Realtor.com, said the financial markets expect the central bank to lower its benchmark rate. The Fed doesn\u2019t set mortgage rates, but its decisions influence them.\n\n\u201cMortgage rates rose this week riding a wave of investor sell-off in the Treasury bond market, fueled by concerns over the German \u2014 and by extension \u2014 the broader European economy,\u201d Ratiu said. \u201cMoreover, equity markets have already priced in an expected rate cut from the Federal Reserve at its next meeting.\u201d\n\nBankrate.com, which puts out a weekly mortgage rate trend index, found that nearly two-thirds of the experts it surveyed say rates will move higher in the coming week.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe past few days have presented positive news which tends to ease uncertainty,\u201d said Elizabeth Rose, mortgage planning specialist with AmCap Home Loans in Plano, Tex. \u201cAs uncertainty eases, mortgage bonds move lower in price, which translates to higher rates for home buyers. Currently, there remains more downside risk in bonds than there is upside potential.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, mortgage applications rebounded slightly on the strength of purchasers. According to the latest data from the Mortgage Bankers Association, the market composite index \u2014 a measure of total loan application volume \u2014 increased 2 percent from a week earlier. The refinance index was flat at 0.4 percent, while the purchase index rose 5 percent.\n\nThe refinance share of mortgage activity accounted for 60 percent of all applications.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe lowest mortgage rates in nearly three years pulled applications 2 percent higher,\u201d said Bob Broeksmit, MBA president and CEO. \u201cWith refinances mostly unchanged, home buyers took advantage of the decline in rates last week. Purchase activity jumped 5 percent and was a solid 9 percent higher than a year ago.\"\n\nThe MBA also released its mortgage credit availability index (MCAI) this week that showed credit availability decreased in August. The MCAI fell 3.9 percent to 181.7 last month. A decline in the MCAI indicates that lending standards are tightening, while an increase signals they are loosening.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cCredit supply declined across the board in August, even as mortgage rates fell and application activity picked up, particularly for refinances,\u201d Joel Kan, an MBA economist, said in a statement. \u201cLast month\u2019s decrease was the largest since December 2018, and also the first tightening we have seen for conventional loans all year. We anticipate some weakening of the job market in the year ahead as economic growth cools. It\u2019s possible some lenders may be tightening credit in expectation of a slowdown.\u201d\n\nMore Real Estate:\n\nHow a 20-year home mortgage can save you a ton of money\n\nVeterans seeking mortgages will be hurt by government\u2019s plan to hike VA home loan fees\n\nSelf-employed and trying to get a mortgage?
