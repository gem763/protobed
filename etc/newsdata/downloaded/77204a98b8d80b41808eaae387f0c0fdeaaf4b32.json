(AP) \u2014 With no electricity for the fourth straight day Tuesday, chef and caterer Jane Sykes realized she would have to throw out $1,000 worth of food, including trays of brownies, cupcakes and puff pastry.\n\nShe also had little hope of getting a good night\u2019s sleep \u2014 there was no way to run the machine she relies on to counter her apnea.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think PG&E really thought this through,\u201d she lamented.\n\nFrustration and anger mounted across Northern California on Tuesday as the state\u2019s biggest utility, Pacific Gas & Electric, began another round of widespread blackouts aimed at preventing its electrical equipment from sparking wildfires in high winds.\n\nMillions of people have been without power for days as fire crews race to contain two major wind-whipped blazes that have destroyed dozens of homes at both ends of the state: in Sonoma County wine country and in the hills of Los Angeles.\n\nAcross Northern California, people worried about charging cellphones and electric vehicles, finding gasoline and cash, and keeping their food from spoiling and staying warm. They donned headlamps at home and parked their cars outside inoperable automatic garage doors.\n\nSome ended up at centers set up by PG&E where people could go to power their electronics and get free water, snacks, flashlights and solar lanterns.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a hidden cost,\u201d Sykes said. \u201cAbsolutely public safety above all else, but there\u2019s a big financial loss for my profession, having to throw away a lot of hard work.\u201d\n\nPG&E said Tuesday\u2019s blackouts \u2014 the third round in a week \u2014 would affect about 1.5 million people in 29 counties, including 1 million still without power from a shut-off over the weekend.\n\nThe outages have made people like Linda Waldron, a mother of two who lives north of San Francisco in San Rafael, realize the things we take for granted.\n\nShe discovered she was low on gas and began to panic as she drove around looking for an open gas station. She wound up driving to San Francisco, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) away, before she found one. She also stocked up on cash after realizing she had only $1 in her wallet.\n\n\u201cWhat if we needed to evacuate and I had no gas in the car?\u201d she said as her 5-year-old daughter and 3-year-old son cavorted at a playground. \u201cI didn\u2019t even think about gas and cash because I\u2019m too busy with these guys.\u201d\n\nIn Placer County, Angel Smith relied on baby wipes and blankets to keep her 13-month-old son Liam warm and clean. The family has been without power since Saturday night and cannot draw well water without electricity.\n\nShe ran a cord from her neighbors\u2019 generator to keep her phone and tablet charged so the two could watch movies. Temperatures were expected to drop below freezing overnight in parts of Northern California.\n\n\u201cThe hardest part about this for me has been making sure I keep my son warm as it gets cold here,\u201d Smith said.\n\nIn Mendocino County, officials say they are struggling to keep the public informed because they can\u2019t trust the information they\u2019re getting from PG&E.\n\n\u201cThe issue isn\u2019t even all of the power shutoffs,\u201d said Carmel Angelo, the county\u2019s chief executive. \u201cIt\u2019s the lack of communication. It\u2019s letting people think they\u2019re getting their power back.\u201d\n\nAfter the weekend shutoff, some people were led to believe the power would come back Monday and that the next round of outages would avoid Mendocino\u2019s most populous areas. But Angelo said she learned Tuesday that the outage was still in effect because of two damaged transmission lines dozens of miles away Marin County.\n\nIf people knew the lights would be out for a week they could\u2019ve planned accordingly, she said. It\u2019s been especially troublesome for those who need oxygen. Some of the trucks that resupply oxygen have been caught in long delays for gas, and some patients have been admitted to the emergency room as a precaution, she said.\n\nMendocino residents Suzanne Lemley Schein and her husband, Glenn, lost power on Saturday and have been spending the time since playing backgammon by candlelight and going to bed early.\n\nThey haven\u2019t been able to rent out a studio on their property, or even offer it to wildfire evacuees, because it has no power or water.\n\nShe said she doesn\u2019t like \u201cthe power that PG&E has over all of us,\u201d she said. \u201cThis has crippled us in a lot of ways.\u201d\n\nSykes, the caterer, is among some people in well-to-do Marin County, north of San Francisco, who have been without power since Saturday.\n\nShe lives in San Rafael but works in San Francisco, so she has \u201ccivilization during the day,\u201d but she said it is eerie to drive along darkened highways. She hasn\u2019t opened her freezer since the outage and is not looking forward to it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s not going to be salvageable,\u201d she said.\n\nPG&E, which is in bankruptcy after its equipment was blamed for a string of disastrous fires over the past three years, including a blaze that all but destroyed the town of Paradise and killed 85 people, has said its foremost concern is public safety.\n\nBut Gov. Gavin Newsom and top utility regulators have accused the company of mismanaging its power system and failing for decades to make the investments needed to make it more durable. He and others have also complained that the utility has botched the outages by not keeping the public adequately informed.\n\nPG&E said Monday its power lines may have started two smaller wildfires over the weekend in a part of the San Francisco Bay Area, where the utility had kept the lights on because it was not designated a high fire risk.\n\nLafayette resident Vicki McCaslin, 60, was evacuated during one of those fires and wasn\u2019t happy to have the power back on Tuesday morning.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m scared to death,\u201d she said at a Starbucks in Lafayette, where people have gathered to charge phones over the past few days. \u201cI don\u2019t want it on if there\u2019s strong winds tonight.\n\nThe California Public Utilities Commission plans to open an investigation that could result in fines against PG&E.\n\nThe commission said it also plans to review the rules governing blackouts, will look to prevent utilities from charging customers when the power is off and will convene experts to find grid improvements that might lessen shut-offs next fire season.\n\nThe state can\u2019t continue experiencing such widespread blackouts, \u201cnor should Californians be subject to the poor execution that PG&E in particular has exhibited,\u201d PUC President Marybel Batjer said in a statement.\n\n___\n\nGecker reported from Orinda, California.
