Given the character of the people in question, it is safe to assume that their reasons for doing so are corrupt and motivated by narrowly calculated political self-interest. If Trump is to be impeached for corruption, it must not happen through a process that is itself corrupt. If corruption must be corruptly rooted out, better to leave it in place and let the voters decide, relying on whatever mysterious criterion guides those baffling wonderments, for themselves.\n\nThis country and its institutions can bear only so much corruption. Nancy Pelosi has the opportunity to act like she believes that \u2014 or to add to the problem. Nothing good is likely to come from this in any case, but conducting these affairs in secret will corrode what little public confidence remains in the ability of Washington to actually see to the business of governing.\n\nThe time has come to act, Madame Speaker. Enough with the gutless calculation. The country needs leadership and, for our sins, you\u2019re what we\u2019ve got. Do your duty and open the people\u2019s business in the people\u2019s house to the people.", "description": "", "authors": ["Kevin Williamson", "Nationalreview.Com Bring-Impeachment-Into-The-Light"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
