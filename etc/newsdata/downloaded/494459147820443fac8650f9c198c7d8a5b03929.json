The tool\u2019s tracking function was abused to attack police, as well as to commit crimes in unpatrolled areas, and that ran counter to Apple\u2019s guidelines. But the company\u2019s reversal came after the ruling party\u2019s official newspaper, the People\u2019s Daily, declared that Apple\u2019s support for \u201ctoxic apps\u201d made the company \u201can accomplice to the rioters.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nQuartz was another story. Apple complies with local laws wherever it operates, and President Xi Jinping\u2019s laws don\u2019t respect press freedom. Apple removed the app because China said to do so, just as it removed the New York Times\u2019s almost three years ago.\n\nApple justifies acceding to despotic demands by arguing that it is the cost of operating in China, and that the Chinese people are better off with a big U.S. firm around than without. Apple and its peers can facilitate a freer flow of information \u2014 not to mention better privacy protections, on many of which the company says it will not compromise \u2014 than homegrown firms. The question, of course, is how free. Sometimes, corporations might go to the mat for what\u2019s right, and sometimes they might win. But, other times, they will lose, and then they are left with a choice to leave China altogether or help warp the world its residents are allowed to see.\n\nWhen the United States and its allies made the decision to engage with China, they imagined that economic growth and trade would promote political liberalization and a convergence of values. That hasn\u2019t happened. Instead, there is competition between vastly different sets of values, and China doesn\u2019t hesitate to use the lure of its market to demand fealty to its propaganda line. Apple, the National Basketball Association and other businesses should resist \u2014 but they need help. The United States should negotiate not only over soybean purchases and steel quotas but also to protect free speech and other liberties that China would erode.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Apple and other U.S. companies should stand up to China.
