They perished in the first few decades of communist rule in China, victims of the murderous ideological orgies of Mao Zedong\u2019s Cultural Revolution and Great Leap Forward.\n\nThe astounding number of deaths attributed to Mao, more than the entire populations of all but a few countries in the world, makes him the greatest mass killer in human history.\n\nSome will argue that Mao was an aberration and it is unfair to condemn the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) for his excesses in the 1960s and \u201970s. Yet it is inconveniently true that his Thought and Teachings are still revered as gospel in communist doctrine today; his embalmed body lies in state in Beijing\u2019s Tiananmen Square; and his portrait dominates that special space at China\u2019s governmental epicenter.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nChina\u2019s present leader, Xi Jinping, differs from his post-Mao predecessors only in the frequency of his explicit invocations of Maoism, not his adherence to its ruling philosophy.\n\nBut there is no greater demonstration of the continuity of Mao\u2019s legacy as innately at the center of communism in China than to recall the rule of that Great Reformer, Deng Xiaoping. Succeeding to power after Mao\u2019s death, Deng charmed the West with his diminutive stature and professed commitment to abandoning Mao\u2019s ways and opening China to the world, seemingly in the way Richard Nixon envisioned when he said, \u201cChina must change.\u201d\n\nDeng convinced the international community that a new China was just over the horizon as he encouraged Western investment in the Chinese economy. He also inspired the Chinese people to believe that a new day had dawned and the fever of Mao\u2019s insane rampage was over.\n\nSuddenly, freedom of thought and freedom of expression seemed not only possible but entirely normal under Deng\u2019s reformist rule and, by 1989, the hopefulness blossomed into a peaceful nationwide call for political reform to match the economic relaxation.\n\nStill, with Chinese and world public opinion clearly behind him, eager to support the next phase of China\u2019s return to normalcy, Deng suddenly reverted to true communist form, rejecting any notion that governing legitimacy should be based on popular will and the consent of the governed. He returned with a vengeance to Mao\u2019s doctrine that \"political power grows out of the barrel of a gun,\" turning the weapons and tanks of the People\u2019s Liberation Army against the Chinese people in Tiananmen Square and hundreds of other Chinese cities.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDeng reasoned that international condemnation was a price the CCP would have to pay to maintain its absolute hold on power. The initial outcry would not last long, given the allure of the Chinese market and the propensity of Western governments and scholars to give China\u2019s communist leaders the benefit of the doubt and explain away even its humanitarian outrages.\n\nDeng was right. Henry Kissinger said Deng had acted like any other world leader who saw its main square occupied by protesters. President George H.W. Bush sent his national security adviser to meet with Deng and assure him that America would conduct business as usual.\n\nBut Deng realized that China\u2019s communist system had itself dodged a bullet by perpetrating a massacre before the world\u2019s eyes and getting away with it. The year after Tiananmen, he cautioned his colleagues not to try the same frontal assault on the international system \u2014 at least not yet \u2014 but to conceal Beijing\u2019s true hostile intentions: \u201cBide your time, hide your capabilities.\u201d\n\nOf course, for those willing to see, from its very creation, the People\u2019s Republic already had revealed its hostile worldview. In little over a year since Mao said \u201cChina has stood up,\u201d it joined North Korea in the invasion of South Korea, and invaded and occupied Tibet and East Turkestan/Xinjiang. Border wars followed against the Soviet Union, India and Vietnam (just a few years after China had helped North Vietnam invade and conquer the South).\n\nBeijing demonstrated its aggressive designs on Taiwan repeatedly over the decades, shelling the islands of Quemoy and Matsu and firing missiles across the Taiwan Strait, even passing an Anti-Secession Law declaring its intention to attack it.\n\nIn recent years, Beijing revealed the full scope of its ambitions by taking a page from the expansionist playbook of Imperialist Japan in the 1930s and \u201940s. Even as it constantly stokes the embers of World War II to keep nationalist resentments smoldering, Beijing emulates the last century\u2019s Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere with its nine-dash-line claim to the entire South China Sea, its land features and its vast natural resources.\n\nBeijing seeks to stir Chinese pride in what the People\u2019s Republic has accomplished on the world stage, but the people of Tiananmen, Tibet, East Turkestan/Xinjiang and now Hong Kong have reason to feel a sense of shame and resentment at the nature of the government that rules them and the international company it keeps with the world\u2019s most repressive and corrupt regimes.\n\nThat is particularly true as they become increasingly aware of the Communist Party\u2019s own disgraceful record on human rights, ranging from cultural genocide in Tibet and Xinjiang to forced organ harvesting of political and religious dissidents, all very much redolent of the earlier abuses of the Cultural Revolution and subsequent excesses such as the one-child policy and its practice of infanticide.\n\nChina may have made itself an economic and military power by its proclivity to \u201clie, cheat and steal\u201d its way, as Ronald Reagan said of the Soviet Union. But the Chinese people have demonstrated that, having endured a century of humiliation at the hands of the West, they do not wish to suffer a new century of shame imposed by their own leaders.\n\nThey know that before China can achieve world greatness based on respect rather than fear, they will have to aspire to a minimal level of normal decency in the way it behaves in the international community and toward the Chinese people. The People\u2019s Republic continues to fail that basic responsibility because, for the Chinese Communist Party, national honor is simply a slogan meant to manipulate the masses and intimidate the West. Oct. 1 is an unhappy birthday for China and the world.\n\nJoseph Bosco served as China country director for the secretary of Defense from 2005 to 2006 and as Asia-Pacific director of humanitarian assistance and disaster relief from 2009 to 2010.
