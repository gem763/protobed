But bring the nuns (Picture: BBC)\n\nGatiss has penned episodes in Doctor Who, Sherlock as well as a handful of films, whilst Moffat worked alongside him on Sherlock, as well as Jekyll, Doctor Who and the Adventures of Tintin, to name a few.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe can only imagine what they\u2019ve brewed up together.\n\nThe Aesthetics\n\nThe series will be set in Victorian England and Transylvania: think elaborate dog collars and beautiful dresses against a gothic, brooding backdrop.\n\nWith technological advances in CGI and film production, it\u2019ll be interesting to see how the series will show the supernatural elements of the series. Gone are the days of plastic vampire teeth, over-done makeup and visible wires.\n\nWe hope.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nIconic scene with the Three Sisters\n\nOne of the most iconic scenes in the book is when English solicitor Jonathan Harker (played by John Heffernan in the BBC One adaptation) accidentally stumbles across three female vampires called the Three Sisters, who seduce and almost devour him before he is rescued by Dracula.\n\nWho will play Dracula\u2019s enemy?\n\nAbraham Van Helsing is the man who hunts down Dracula and is part of the party who kills him. He\u2019s another character who has stood the test of time and has been played by dozens of actors in dozens of contexts. How the writers will introduce his character remains to be seen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDepending on the Dracula adaptation, Van Helsing has been an occult specialist, a hunter, a doctor. In this BBC adaptation, will Dracula and Van Helsing\u2019s relationship be similar to that of Villanelle and Eve Polastri in Killing Eve?\n\nHow will Lucy Westenra fare in the new series?\n\nLucy is the manifestation of good in Dracula\u2019s dark world, and she is an iconic character in the story. In most iterations of the story she ends up being stalked, and later turned into a vampire by Dracula. Her fall prerequisites his, and we wonder who will play Lucy, and what her character will be to Dracula.\n\nWe want to know.\n\nWhat about the original story\u2019s deleted ending?\n\nIn the original manuscript draft of the final chapter, Dracula\u2019s castle falls apart after he dies. Will this be something Moffat and Gatiss will depict, or will they use their artistic licence to come up with a more sinister ending?\n\nDracula is set to air on BBC One in the UK and on Netflix outside of the UK and Ireland.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
