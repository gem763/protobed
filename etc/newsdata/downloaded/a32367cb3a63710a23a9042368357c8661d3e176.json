Yet the senator\u2019s recent efforts underscore his insistence on not receding from a Republican Party now dominated by Trump. At 72 and in the twilight of his political career, Romney cares little about what the president has to say about him, his friends say, and is determined to take a stand for mainstream Republicans who've been increasingly marginalized since Trump took office.\n\n\"I know plenty of my candidates would love Romney's fundraising help \u2014 he\u2019s got a huge donor network, regardless of the Twitter sentiment of the day,\" said Will Ritter, a top aide on Romney's 2018 Senate campaign, referring to Trump's attacks.\n\nThe senator is stepping up after Trump just unleashed a withering assault on the 2012 GOP nominee over his refusal to rule out supporting impeachment. Over the weekend, Trump called the Utah senator a \u201cpompous \u2018ass,\u2019\u201d who is \u201cso bad for Rs.\u201d The president added that Romney was \u201cplaying right into the hands\u201d of Democrats and tweeted out a video of him losing the 2012 election.\n\nTrump\u2019s allies are piling on. Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani said Romney was \u201cbitter about Donald Trump\u201d winning the White House. Conservative radio show host Rush Limbaugh told listeners that Romney is determined to \u201cget rid of Trump.\u201d And Donald Trump Jr. said that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is \u201cmuch tougher than Mittens.\u201d\n\nThe senator further infuriated the Trump team when he called the president\u2019s appeal to China to investigate Joe Biden \u201cwrong and appalling.\u201d\n\nRomney is shrugging it all off. On Thursday evening, he hosted a fundraiser for the Utah Republican Party, an organization that's been plagued by financial and organizational troubles. Within the state\u2019s political circles, the event was considered particularly noteworthy because conservatives formerly involved in the state GOP apparatus vocally opposed Romney\u2019s 2018 Senate bid.\n\nRomney\u2019s presence at the Salt Lake City dinner, held at the home of real estate executive Scott Keller, is designed to provide encouragement to mainstream Republicans who\u2019ve long felt alienated from the state party. The Utah GOP is trying to rebuild itself following midterm elections that saw Republicans lose a congressional seat and a half-dozen state legislative seats.\n\n\u201cHaving someone as well-known as Mitt Romney publicly supporting the Utah Republican Party\u2019s fundraising efforts effectively sends a signal to former donors, the business community, and the entire Utah political establishment that \u2018the water is warm,\u2019 so to speak, and it\u2019s safe to jump back in,\u201d said state GOP Chairman Derek Brown.\n\nAfter he became chairman earlier this year, Brown said, Romney \u201cmade it very clear to me that he was willing to play an active role in supporting the party.\u201d\n\nSo far this year, Romney has funneled cash to roughly a dozen county GOP organizations.\n\nBut most of his donations in 2019 have been directed to his Senate colleagues. After taking office in January, he gave the maximum contribution of $5,600 to each Republican incumbent up for reelection in 2020 \u2014 an unusual, if not unprecedented, gesture for a freshman senator.\n\nThis spring, he held a high-dollar fundraiser in Florida for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Over the summer, he was a special guest at an event for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

His team has also encouraged longtime Romney givers to boost Arizona Sen. Martha McSally, who faces an uphill battle to keep her seat against star Democratic recruit Mark Kelly, the onetime astronaut and husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords. Trump\u2019s approval rating in the state has dropped to the mid-40s, according to some recent surveys.\n\nThe upcoming fundraiser to benefit Gardner, Collins, and James is expected to draw an exclusive group of major givers. Investment company executive Stephen Schwarzman is listed as a co-host, according to an invitation obtained by POLITICO.\n\nRomney's aides are aware that his fundraising help may not be welcomed by every Republican candidate. But the three beneficiaries of the New York City event have shown a willingness to demonstrate independence from the president. Trump lost Maine and Colorado in 2016, and the president\u2019s reelection aides are increasingly pessimistic about his odds in Michigan.\n\n\u201cI think there is definitely a role for him to play,\u201d said Boyd Matheson, an opinion editor at the Deseret News newspaper who has been in touch with Romney via text message, \u201cespecially in the purple states where Trump isn\u2019t doing especially well.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/5d/73/44daef6045f1a2014300b34ee24c/190420-romney-trump-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
