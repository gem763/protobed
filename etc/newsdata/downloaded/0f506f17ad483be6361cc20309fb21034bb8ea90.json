Little did they know, they\u2019d only get to hold that record for three weeks.\n\nThe concept of using electric vehicles for coast-to-coast \u201cCannonball Run\u201d speed trials is fairly new, and only started gaining popularity when the EV charging infrastructure started to mature. But in the last few years, more EV owners have made attempts at setting a new record. Some do it to promote a business or a cause, others for the sheer thrill of racing across the country, knowing that every second counts. The added challenge of driving an electric car, and the time it takes to recharge the vehicle\u2019s battery, is also appealing to many would-be Cannonball Runners.\n\nThe concept of using electric vehicles for coast-to-coast \u201cCannonball Run\u201d speed trials is fairly new\n\nLars Thomsen bought a Model 3 in 2018 in the US, and imported it to Switzerland. Back in the States for a family vacation with the car a year later, Thomsen thought it would be fun to try to beat the most recent EV Cannonball Run record of 50 hours and 16 minutes, set by Alex Roy and Dan Zorrilla in 2018. His wife Betty wasn\u2019t so keen on the idea.\n\n\u201cShe said, \u2018That\u2019s not my idea of a vacation at all,\u2019\u201d Thomsen told The Verge.\n\nUltimately, he wore her down, and on July 12th, the two set out with their daughter Robin \u2014 who had just received her driver\u2019s license \u2014 from the Red Ball Garage in New York City, the traditional starting point for Cannonball Runs. They arrived at the traditional finish line, the Portofino Inn in Redondo Beach, California, 48 hours and 10 minutes later.\n\nThomsen said he had two goals throughout the run: not to break the speed limit; and only pull over to recharge the battery when it was practically depleted. They averaged 58.9 miles per hour over the 2,800-mile trip, with 19 total stops at Tesla\u2019s Supercharger stations. Thomsen credits Navigate on Autopilot, Tesla\u2019s most advanced version of its driver assist system, for helping to reduce fatigue during the journey.\n\n48 hours and 10 minutes\n\n\u201cIf you steer by hand and you want to keep a car in lane for 48 hours, at some point in time, you\u2019re going to get tired,\u201d Thomsen said of Autopilot. \u201cBut we never had any issues that somebody was about to fall asleep.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, Thomsen only had about three weeks to enjoy his record-holding status before two men, Kyle Conner and Matthew Davis, came along and snatched it away. Inspired by Roy and his exploits, Connor said he saw the Cannonball Run as an opportunity to make his mark, as well as promote his business, Out of Spec, which helps car enthusiasts transition to electric vehicles.\n\nThey set out from New York City on July 31st, and arrived in Los Angeles 45 hours and 16 minutes later. Like the Thomsens, Conner and Davis drove a Tesla Model 3 long-range RWD, but with a few modifications, like lowering the car for better aerodynamics. Unlike the Thomsens, Conner and Davis eschewed Autopilot except for a few instances of bumper-to-bumper traffic \u2014 nor did they adhere to the speed limit (which helps explain why they didn\u2019t use Autopilot; the system is speed capped at 90 mph).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s illegal, but like, we were never flying by people and children,\u201d Conner said. \u201cWe were very conscious of that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s illegal, but like, we were never flying by people and children.\u201d\n\nAs they raced across the country, Conner said he and Davis were single-minded in their focus. \u201cThere was no boredom at all,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anything, the trip went by in a flash. We were thinking constantly about our speed, our efficiency, where\u2019s our next charger, what\u2019s traffic like. You know, really constantly working.\u201d\n\nThomsen said there\u2019s no hard feelings for Connor and Davis; in fact, he plans on getting together with Conner for dinner in New York City in a few weeks to discuss their respective runs, and perhaps plot future business endeavors. If anything, he says he feels a camaraderie with the two men.\n\n\u201cWe were probably the last ones to get the electric Cannonball mostly within the limits of the law,\u201d Thomsen said.\n\nConner agrees that it will either take an improvement in battery technology to increase capacity or reduce charging times, or a driver with less compunction about breaking the law, to achieve a better run time \u2014 which is not to say it won\u2019t happen.\n\n\u201cIt would take a lot to beat our record,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you know, it\u2019s absolutely doable.\u201d", "description": "In mid-July, a family from Switzerland broke the US record for fastest cross-country trip in an electric vehicle, completing the New York-to-California journey in a long-range Tesla Model 3 in just 48 hours and 10 minutes.
