This is oil country. My father has worked in the oil industry. We don't need foreigners coming in and telling us how to run our business, support our families, put food on our tables.'\n\nBagnell saw photos of the mural on social media and jumped into action to 'deal with it.'\n\nThe man said his father, who recently died, would have been 'disgusted' by Thunberg's image.\n\n'I think it's absolutely intolerant of them to tell us how to change our lives and our people. She should go back to her country and try to make her country better.'\n\n'Stop the Lies,' he sprawled over the 16-year-old's face. 'This is Oil Country!'\n\nBagnell claimed that Thunberg was a child who is 'doing what she's told,' adding that she doesn't know better.\n\nWhile he claims to be in favor of becoming more eco-friendly, Bagnell feels Thunberg offers no real solutions.\n\nBagnell claimed that Thunberg was a child who is 'doing what she's told,' adding that she doesn't know better\n\n'Just shut up until you have solutions,' he added.\n\nLouden understands why people would paint over the mural and shared he was not upset about the message.\n\n'Nothing lasts forever \u2014 one of my favourite things about that wall is that anyone is allowed to express themselves there, so I'm not upset at all. I haven't seen what went over it, but if anyone is upset about what was painted over the portrait, they can just paint back over it, it's not a big deal at all,' Louden said.\n\nMary Bjorgum, a passerby, shared she was disappointed by Bagnell's message.\n\n'Incredibly disappointed because it was a beautiful piece of artwork, time and effort went into making it,' Bjorgum said. 'I appreciate that they want to express there but to actually deface it is quite another thing.'\n\nLast year, a study released by Environmental Defence - a Canadian advocacy organization - found that oil and gas emissions in Canada are rising.\n\nIt also found that oil and gas companies in Canada are 'systematically weakening and delaying Canada's climate plan and further climate ambition while reaping more federal subsidies and continuing to increase oil production.'\n\n'According to the report, the current growth trajectory for oil and gas production in Canada is inconsistent with the country meeting even its existing target,' the organization said in the report. 'To meet the targets laid out in the IPCC report, oil production will have to be curtailed.'", "description": "The Swedish teenager's likeliness was painted on a section of a 'free wall' bike path that runs along the 109 Street in Edmonton near Alberta's legislature.
