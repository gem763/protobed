Good on you for giving her a feed. She must be starving to ask like this,' one user said.\n\n'Good on you for giving the wildlife a feed and having water out. They may be a nuisance but that mama was no doubt very grateful,' another commented.\n\nThe kangaroo then helped itself to a bowl of bird seed that the owner had put out for her (pictured)\n\nThe man said he didn't usually give food to any wandering kangaroos but was unable to say no after seeing 'that look on her face'.\n\nHe also said the animals were common in his neighbourhood, and he regularly left out water for any passing by.\n\nAustralia has twice as many kangaroos as it has people.\n\nBut some states have seen population numbers dive as drought continues to dry up their food and water sources.", "description": "In a video shared to Reddit, the animal is seen standing at the door before making its way into the backyard of the New South Wales property.", "authors": ["Eliza Mcphee For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/15/19594646-0-image-a-31_1570805809557.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
