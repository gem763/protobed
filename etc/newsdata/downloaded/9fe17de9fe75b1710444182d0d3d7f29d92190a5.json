Argentina also beat Tonga on Saturday, doing so with a 26-minute bonus point before the scoring strangely dried up, though if one thing was prominent in their display in Osaka it was the power of their driving maul. England also demonstrated that strength in the win over the United States with two tries created from their forward dominance, and Sinckler predicts a clash of the powerhouse packs when they collide.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

It just gets our game going, when our tank and our maul and our scrum get going. We get into a good flow and a good rhythm. It\u2019s something, especially in the first 20-30 minutes, that we always try to get our teeth stuck in to it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s rugby union at the end of the day.\u201d\n\nSinckler will win his 28th cap for England against the Pumas on what has been a steady yet steep rise to becoming Eddie Jones\u2019s first-choice tighthead prop. The Harlequins forward is perhaps unrivalled with his ball-carrying skills when it comes to his position, with only Ireland\u2019s Tadhg Furlong coming close, but it took him a while to learn that the more aesthetical skills within his game were not the ones that would get him selected by Jones.\n\n\u201cThe main thing is that, as a tighthead prop playing for England, your bread and butter is your scrum,\u201d adds Sinckler. \u201cIn his opinion, until my scrummaging was at a level where I could start consistently, I don\u2019t think he would have given me a chance.\n\n\u201cI had to work extremely hard on that part of my game \u2013 probably something that doesn\u2019t come as naturally to me, but something that I pride myself on now. My go-to now is my set piece first, and once I get that going, everything else falls into place.\u201d\n\nAs mentioned, it took some time for those foundations to fall into place. Sinckler has spoken fully of his childhood and how he has rugby to thank for sending him down the right path. It explains his love of the game and interest within it that marks him out of the nause of the current squad: if there\u2019s a game you want to talk about, Sinckler\u2019s seen it, a player to discuss, Sinckler knows everything about him.\n\nThis rugby intelligence helps his drive to take his game to the next level, but he has had to learn how to do that. Not so long ago, Sinckler wasn\u2019t an England international, wasn\u2019t a British and Irish Lion and wasn\u2019t even getting into the Harlequins squad, and he didn\u2019t know why.\n\n\u201cIt's been one hell of a journey from when I couldn't even get a game for Quins,\u201d he said. \u201cI was always on the bench. To be at a World Cup, to have played for the Lions, to have won 27 caps \u2013 hopefully I'll get a load more than that \u2013 but it's been amazing.\n\n\u201cBut I didn't realise how much hard work it would require. When I was a lot younger, looking back now, I was probably very selfish and quite arrogant in terms of how good I thought I was. When I look back I was nowhere near as good as I thought I was. I always thought it was someone else's fault. The coach doesn't like me, this is rubbish, I should be playing etc.\n\n\u201cI was lucky that [former Wales prop] Adam Jones came to the club. He gave me a little kick up the backside and then Eddie gave me a chance. Before that Australia tour in 2016 I think I started one game for Quins that year. He gave me a taste and I thought 'I need to step my game up.' Luckily in that autumn after the Australia tour I got capped.\n\n\u201cI was lucky I had some really good people around me and it all fell into place at the right time. If it hadn't I don't know where my career would have gone.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s obvious that Sinckler holds a great deal of thanks to his current international coach for giving him that opportunity. After last season\u2019s slump in form, Jones decided to freshen up his England squad in the hope of rediscovering the results that filled his first two years in charge, with one of those changes seeing Sinckler swapped in as starting tighthead prop instead of Dan Cole.\n\nHe now sees the same happening again, only with one of his teammates. \u201cEddie giving me that chance...look at Lewis Ludlam now, he can find a diamond in the rough, so to speak. Luds hasn't looked out of place and has done extremely well. It just takes that one person to believe in you and give you a chance.\n\n\u201cI'm just grateful I got that opportunity. I didn't play on that Australia tour but I got a taste of the training, the nutrition \u2013 little things like the importance of sleep. Before I used to think sleep was over-rated, now I need to get my eight hours no matter what. It makes such a big difference to recovery, how you eat, how you train, looking after your body, the mental side of the game. It was just what I needed at that particular point in my career. It was just quite fortunate.\u201d\n\nAnother man who Sinckler has taken enjoyment in watching develop into an England international is Ellis Genge, the loosehead who has impressed in Japan with very similar skills to Sinckler. The 'Baby Rhino', as he was coined a few years a go and fully adopted as his nickname, shares a similar journey to the national team as Sinckler, coming through adversity before being forced by Jones to learn the lessons of the game. Does that mean Sinckler has his own nickname, too?\n\n\"I'm the old war horse, it feels like! I have so many nicknames I could be here all day, and I don't know how many you could publish. Just Sinks, that's it.\"", "description": "Kyle Sinckler has backed England\u2019s \u201ctank\u201d to destroy Argentina\u00a0and book their place in the Rugby World Cup quarter-finals, with the two Pool C rivals determined to maul each other off the park.
