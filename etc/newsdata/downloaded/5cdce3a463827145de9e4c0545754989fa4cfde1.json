Management also think the fourth quarter will show further slowing. So the tough comparisons with the last 12 months or so suggests they are maxed out or close to maxing out the organic growth.\"\n\nOther main points in its trading update included:\n\nLike-for-like sales for the year to date have risen by 9.4%, helped by a new autumn menu and offers\n\nTotal sales are up by 13.9% this year so far\n\n90 new stores have opened during 2019 so far, while 34 sites have closed\n\nGreggs added it was continuing to trial evening openings, with deals for pizza and hot food available in some stores after 4pm.", "description": "The bakery chain wants to make sure that ingredients for its sausage rolls are safeguarded.", "authors": ["Bill Wilson", "Business Reporter", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7E89/production/_109039323_mediaitem109037251.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
