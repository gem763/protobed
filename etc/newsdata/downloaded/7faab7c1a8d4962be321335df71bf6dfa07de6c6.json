(Alisa Siegel/CBC)\n\nBut one night every summer, a local businesswoman in Leamington named Joan Grey \u2014 who knows what it's like to be down on your luck \u2014 throws a party, just for them. She books a local hall, recruits volunteers to prepare jerk chicken and pork, rice and beans.\n\nThere's live gospel music, games and a lots of laughs. The farm workers come in droves.\n\nIt's Grey's way to show the migrant workers they're not invisible. \"I call them the forgotten workers,\" she said.\n\n\"All these beautiful vegetables and fruits that we have on our table, where did it come from? These are migrant workers who are working to pick it... They give to us and we should give back to them,\" Grey said.\n\nThis is a feeling like we're back home ... I get to see a lot of black people and say, 'Oh, I feel like I'm home. I'm back in Jamaica' - Migrant worker\n\n\"[In Jamaica], we are friendly people. If you pass someone on the road you don't know, they say hi to you and they wave and you see a genuine smile. But being here I've noticed it's different. It's a culture shock for me, to pass someone and not have someone acknowledge your presence,\" one migrant worker at the party told The Sunday Edition's documentary producer Alisa Siegel.\n\n\"Sometimes you will even try and say hi to them, and they just ignore you. It plays on your mind. It makes you feel less than who you are.\"\n\nAt the party, it's a completely different atmosphere.\n\n\"This is a feeling like we're back home ... I get to see a lot of black people and say, 'Oh, I feel like I'm home. I'm back in Jamaica,'\" another worker said.\n\nClick 'listen' above to hear Alisa Siegel's documentary \"The Forgotten Ones.\"", "description": "Migrant farm workers from the Caribbean and Latin America toil in the blazing sun, but live largely in the shadows.
