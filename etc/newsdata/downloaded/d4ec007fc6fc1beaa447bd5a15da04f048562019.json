The good news for these progressives is that the average voter likely did not see the spectacle. New data shows that CNN finished dead last amongst cable news networks on Wednesday night in terms of average viewers:\n\nvia The Hill: CNN averaged 1.1 million viewers from 5 p.m. to midnight, the hours devoted to back-to-back town halls by 10 Democratic contenders.
