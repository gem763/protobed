Her message has featured a blend of revolutionary change, such as abolishing the Senate filibuster to pass a Green New Deal, and pragmatic incrementalism reflected in her \u201c3 a.m. agenda\u201d to focus on what keeps people up at night.\n\nAdams, who worked on Hillary Clinton\u2019s successful 2016 Iowa operation, said the state \u201chas been a proving ground for candidates\u201d and noted that Barack Obama was polling behind the front-runners there in 2008 before he ultimately won.\n\nShe said Harris won\u2019t try to win by tearing down other Democrats, despite her getting the bump during the summer by attacking Biden for his stance on school busing in the 1970s.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Sahil Kapur in Washington at skapur39@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Wendy Benjaminson at wbenjaminson@bloomberg.net, Laurie Ass\u00e9o\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "Falling in the polls, Kamala Harris is changing strategy and making a big bet on the Iowa caucuses, committing time and resources to the first-in-the-nation Democratic presidential contest that has catapulted underdogs to victory in the past.", "authors": [], "top_image": ""}
