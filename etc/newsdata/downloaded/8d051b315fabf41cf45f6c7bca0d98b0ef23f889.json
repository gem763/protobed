(AP) - Officials say a city in central Kentucky is set to become the state\u2019s first urban trail town.\n\nThe News-Enterprise reports the title will go to Elizabethtown for its Greenbelt Trails system and officials plan to recognize the accomplishment on Oct. 1 with a ceremony.\n\nElizabethtown Trail Town Advisory Board member Matt Deneen says the state Department of Tourism developed the new classification as a blueprint for expanding its Trail Town program into urban centers around Kentucky.\n\nMost communities now in the Trail Town program are in the state\u2019s coalfields. The program was originally designed to help promote adventure tourism in rural communities, but now it is moving into urban areas.\n\nElizabethtown\u2019s Greenbelt Trails network features 16 trails, including the Freeman Lake Trail.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The News-Enterprise, http://www.thenewsenterprise.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Officials say a city in central Kentucky is set to become the state's first urban trail town.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
