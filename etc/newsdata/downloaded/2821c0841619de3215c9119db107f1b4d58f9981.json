She was 28 years old, 5ft tall, and hungry. Her shoes were wet from the snow and the temperature had dropped below minus 50. Ivanna and some fellow female prisoners were being escorted by guards through the camp to begin their day of gruelling physical work: mining gold, felling trees and hacking into the frozen ground.\n\nAs they stumbled through the snow, a scrunched-up piece of paper landed at their feet, thrown from a truck transporting male prisoners. One of them picked it up before a guard noticed, and later the women huddled together and opened it. It was from a male prisoner asking whether someone would write to him, to distract him from the relentless bleakness. Ivanna was deeply moved. Five years into her imprisonment, she, too, was desperate for human contact. She decided to reply to this stranger.\n\nIvanna, now 93, tells her story in her one-bedroom ex-council flat in London. The flat is on the top floor and there is no lift, but, although Ivanna is very small and thin, she\u2019s strong enough to walk up and down three flights of concrete stairs several times a day. Born in Ukraine, she was taken from her family one frosty January morning in 1948 while her mother, a schoolteacher, made beetroot soup for lunch. She belonged to a Ukrainian youth organisation, and her brother was a member of the Ukrainian underground. \u201cAt that time every Ukrainian was under suspicion,\u201d Ivanna recalls. \u201cMy father was a priest, which didn\u2019t help, because the authorities were suspicious of priests, members of the intelligentsia, teachers and students.\u201d Even after Nazi Germany\u2019s surrender in May 1945, the civil war in Ukraine and eastern Poland continued, as underground organisations, including the Ukrainian Insurrectionary army, refused to live under communist rule. Ivanna was one of many thousands of ethnic Ukrainians sent to Siberia after being accused of aiding the rebellion.\n\nMilitary guards stormed the house and marched the 22-year-old out of her home and into a truck. \u201cMy mother\u2019s eyes were full of tears,\u201d she says, quietly, in her strong Ukrainian accent. \u201cI told her that I would be back one day. I still can\u2019t believe I ever came back alive.\u201d\n\nIvanna was sentenced to 10 years in Stalin\u2019s labour camps. She was moved from one to another, before she and 700 other prisoners were put on a boat and taken to a gulag in Kolyma, a sub-arctic region in Siberia. \u201cAs we pulled into the wharf we could see snow, and guards in furs,\u201d Ivanna remembers. \u201cWe were in our tatty, thin clothes and, getting off the boat, we were so weak that some of us fell into the snow. We were forced to strip outside and given a typhoid injection \u2013 all with the same needle \u2013 and a lice check.\u201d Everyone got the same size clothes and shoes. \u201cImagine me in huge shoes when I have feet this small,\u201d says Ivanna. \u201cNumbers were sewn on to our backs \u2013 I was 108 \u2013 and we felt our identity was taken away from us.\u201d At night she slept on a wooden plank in barracks alongside hundreds of others.\n\n***\n\nThen the crumpled note landed at Ivanna\u2019s feet. His name was Vladimir; he was the same age as Ivanna and also serving 10 years. She asked around, found out which part of the gulag he was in and, with help from sympathetic construction workers who agreed to pass the notes on, managed to get a letter to him. She used the pen and paper the prisoners were sometimes given in order to write home. Their letters, which Ivanna has kept and shows me, stored in a wooden box, came back and forth, talking of life in the camp (\u201cThere is a roaring snowstorm outside even though it\u2019s spring\u201d), but also philosophy and the idea of freedom. \u201cWhat is happiness?\u201d writes Vladimir in one letter. In another: \u201cOne day the corrective labour system will be recognised as a huge political mistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wanted to find a kindred spirit and I became that person,\u201d Ivanna says now. Despite the fact that they were unable to meet, she began to feel a deep bond with this young man. \u201cAfter the cruelty I had seen, writing to him was some respite from the hell I was in. I was terribly lonely, so to have Vladimir wanting to know how I felt made things bearable.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ivanna Maszczak: \u2018He wanted to find a kindred spirit.\u2019 Photograph: Lydia Goldblatt/The Guardian\n\nThe greatest physical suffering was the hunger, Ivanna says. \u201cWe had one piece of bread and a bowl of fish-bone soup a day. The bread was thin and heavy like clay, because it was full of water. Some prisoners ate it in one go; others \u2013 including me \u2013 divided it into three and carried the other two bits with them all day. We were hungry all the time.\u201d Often, Ivanna was only allowed to eat if she finished her tasks, such as felling trees and hacking into the permafrost. \u201cI rarely finished. I weighed 35kg [5st 5lb] when I was arrested, so I wasn\u2019t built for it, but most people just couldn\u2019t do it all. I wasn\u2019t very strong, but I was stubborn. I kept telling myself I had to survive.\u201d\n\nIt was illegal for prisoners to correspond with each other, so they relied on the construction workers to deliver the letters. \u201cSometimes it took weeks for a letter to come, and some letters disappeared,\u201d Ivanna says. \u201cBut when our system worked, the notes were a salvation.\u201d Soon the tone changed. \u201cAt first it was friendship, but when you talk for so long, so intensely, you start to feel love,\u201d Ivanna says. \u201cIn one letter Vladimir writes, \u201cWaiting for your letters causes my heart to beat faster.\u201d In another, \u201cBelieve me that my love for you is so great that I will do anything for you.\u201d They made tentative plans to meet if they were ever freed.\n\nIvanna was finally released in August 1955, after almost eight years of her sentence. Stalin\u2019s death in 1953 had somewhat thawed the regime; prisoners had begun to rebel and were gradually being let free. Ivanna\u2019s family had no idea she was coming home. \u201cI walked to the door and my mother turned and screamed my name. She started crying with joy, but I wasn\u2019t able to cry. I didn\u2019t know how to live as a free person. Everything seemed strange \u2013 buying milk, going to a hairdresser, eating an apple.\u201d Her freedom came too late for her to be reunited with her father; he had died just two months before her return home.\n\nImages of Ivanna: the pair exchanged photographs after their release. Photograph: Lydia Goldblatt/The Guardian\n\nVladimir was still imprisoned, and when she first wrote to him from the outside world, he replied: \u201cIf I had had the opportunity, I would have left everything behind and followed you. Have you now found everything you dreamed of during these dreadful years? One day we will have the opportunity to meet each other \u2013 but it will not happen soon.\u201d\n\nWhen Vladimir was eventually released two years later, he wrote: \u201cDear Ivanna! Your prayers have reached the heavens and here I am, alive and healthy. Reunited with my parents. There were many events and stories to share but, most importantly, I am home.\u201d\n\nSoon afterwards, Vladimir wrote again to tell Ivanna he was getting married. Under pressure from his father, he would wed his former classmate, someone his family had expected him to be with all along. \u201cDespite the emotions we felt for each other, I was not surprised about the marriage,\u201d she says. \u201cThis was what his father had planned \u2013 he had even tried to stop us writing to each other at one point, believing I would scupper his plans. I felt that, despite his marriage, we had an unbreakable bond: the bond of two people who have been in prison together for so long. We were both trying to adjust to freedom and learn to be with our families again. I understood how things were, that he needed to move on.\u201d Yet the letters kept coming and Vladimir confided in her, telling her he found it difficult to adjust to normal life. \u201cOn the outside everything looks great: I have a wife, a house, a job, friends, but I cannot recover from the nightmares I\u2019ve endured. I watch my life like a film that I am not part of.\u201d\n\nThose letters were a lifeline; they gave me some purpose. I felt that things could be better again one day\n\nA few years later, Ivanna got married, too. While visiting a friend in Britain, she was introduced to a Ukrainian man named Wolodomyr who proposed to her just five days after they met. \u201cI never regretted it. We lived a simple life in London, and were happy together for 47 years,\u201d she says. Wolodomyr, who passed away in 2012, aged 94, understood why the correspondence with Vladimir was still so important to his wife. In May 1965, Vladimir wrote to her in wonderment that it had been \u201c10 years of knowing each other\u2026 of holding pieces of paper on which we shared our thoughts, hopes, doubts, expectations and love. I thank the heavens that you\u2019re in my life.\u201d The following Christmas they exchanged other family photos. Then one morning Ivanna received a curt letter from Vladimir\u2019s wife demanding that the correspondence cease immediately. Ivanna never heard from Vladimir again.\n\nAs darkness falls, she pauses in her story to reach across to switch on a softly lit lamp above the small wooden table where we sit. \u201cIt hurt me greatly. I didn\u2019t write back to Vladimir. I didn\u2019t want to interfere in his family life. I know I was lucky to be released from Siberia early,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I lost out on a chance to meet him.\u201d\n\nThree years ago, contemplating her old age, Ivanna wondered whether this might be a good time to re-establish contact. She Googled Vladimir and found he had his own website. \u201cI recognised him immediately from the photos I\u2019d seen over the years. He now looked older and had grey hair but I knew it was him, and was excited.\u201d\n\nYet after more research she discovered that it was too late, and he had recently died. \u201cI should have tried harder to find him, I regret that I didn\u2019t. But I worried that it would cause problems for him and his marriage if we ever actually met.\u201d\n\n***\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photographs of Vladimir that Ivanna had seen over the years. Photograph: Lydia Goldblatt/The Guardian\n\nIt has now been 64 years since Ivanna was released, but eight years in the gulag still has an impact on her daily life in ways that few outsiders would notice. She doesn\u2019t eat much \u2013 maybe a baked potato at lunch, but usually no dinner. It doesn\u2019t occur to her to want anything that she doesn\u2019t have. She has a small bedroom, but sleeps on a futon in the living room as she hates feeling confined. \u201cI don\u2019t like to admit this, but I don\u2019t like doors being closed because it reminds me of being imprisoned.\u201d She points to the wardrobe doors, slightly ajar. \u201cEven those I keep open,\u201d she says sheepishly.\n\nIt\u2019s been more than 50 years since Ivanna received her final letter from Vladimir. Now in her 90s, she thinks more than ever about the bond they forged in the harsh extremities of the Stalin gulag. \u201cVladimir and I were linked by our experience. Those letters were a lifeline, they gave me some purpose. I felt a sense that things could be better again one day,\u201d she says. It\u2019s clear that Vladimir felt just as strongly. In a letter to Ivanna while he was still imprisoned, he wrote: \u201cLife is very short and we only live once, but, wherever I am and whatever happens to me, I will remember and think of you always.\u201d\n\n\u2018If you get married, I will be terribly jealous\u2019: excerpts from Vladimir\u2019s letters to Ivanna after her release\n\n2 November 1955\n\nI am so glad I haven\u2019t lost contact with you! The news of your departure shook me. I felt lonely and abandoned but then I thought \u2013 you have freedom! On the one hand I felt so happy for you, on the other hand I felt such pain. I knew that you would write, I longed for the moment you would\u2026 sometimes the loneliness became intolerable. Then I sat down and wrote to you without even having your address because it was like having a conversation with you.\n\n31 December 1955\n\nIn these final minutes of New Year\u2019s Eve, I think of you, my dear\u2026 look at the stars, maybe it\u2019s possible that our eyes could meet while looking up at the same stars.\n\n4 February 1956\n\nI love you. But we\u2019ve never met in person. This is probably not the way clever people act. It is so difficult, so difficult to define our relationship! You are so far from me now. But every day you become more dear to me. I can\u2019t forget you and I don\u2019t imagine a future without you.\n\n8 February 1956\n\nI was longing for your letters with an anticipation that can\u2019t be described. I do not know how to thank you for everything you wrote. We owe each other so much and this is why there is no way we\u2019d be able to forget each other. I know that if you get married, I will respect that person although I will be terribly jealous.\n\n25 March 1956\n\nYou wrote that you felt indebted to me for many things \u2013 you do not need to explain \u2013 sometimes I am in awe of everything you have brought into my life. My dear friend! Some things do not need words because none of them could possibly reflect the complexity of our feelings for each other.\n\n18 April 1959\n\nWho knows? We might meet one day. We must believe this, otherwise there is no point to living. You are always in my heart.\n\n\u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).\n\nComments on this piece are premoderated to ensure the discussion remains on the topics raised by the article.
