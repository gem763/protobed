Just yesterday, it surfaced that Simon Morris, Libra\u2018s head of product, left the association.\n\nHowever, Vodafone seems keen to continue its involvement \u2013 at least for now.", "description": "Vodafone wants Libra to appoint an independent chief executive so that it becomes fully separate from Facebook.", "authors": ["Yessi Bello Perez", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/hardfork?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FUntitled-design-94.jpg&signature=625915d959e778249da0653e4e6274aa", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
