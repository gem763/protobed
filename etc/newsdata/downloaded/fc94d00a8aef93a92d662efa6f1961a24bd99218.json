Now, succumbing to pressure once more, they're backing off.\n\nChung 'Blitzchung' Ng Wai\n\nAt the time, Blizzard had rescinded the prize money owed to Blitzchung and disqualified him from the tournament, citing one of their rules that allows them to ban players for what they decide is unprofessional behaviour.\n\nNow, Blizzard has decided to return the money to Blitzchung, allowing him to collect his winnings. They also say they plan to reduce his suspension, which was previously a year long ban on participating in Hearthstone tournaments.\n\nBlizzard president J Allen Brack explained in a statement that the company is committed to upholding its values-Think Globally, Lead Responsibly, and Every Voice Matters. However, he insists that as inclusive as they want their events to be, they want to keep esports focused on esports.\n\nDon't Miss 485 SHARES 901 SHARES\n\n\"The specific views expressed by Blitzchung were NOT a factor in the decision we made,\" Brack wrote. \"I want to be clear: our relationships in China had no influence on our decision. We have these rules to keep the focus on the game and on the tournament to the benefit of a global audience, and that was the only consideration in the actions we took. If this had been the opposing viewpoint delivered in the same divisive and deliberate way, we would have felt and acted the same.\"\n\nBrack goes on to say that Blitzchung didn't break any rules while actually playing the tournament, so the money he won is his fair and square. His year-long ban meanwhile is being reduced to six months.\n\n\"We understand that for some this is not about the prize, and perhaps for others it is disrespectful to even discuss it. That is not our intention,\" Brack wrote. \"But playing fair also includes appropriate pre-and post-match conduct, especially when a player accepts recognition for winning in a broadcast. When we think about the suspension, six months for Blitzchung is more appropriate, after which time he can compete in the Hearthstone pro circuit again if he so chooses.\"\n\nBlizzard's Chinese website (L) does not feature the News update regarding Blitzchung on the global website (R) - Reddit\n\nAt the time, Blizzard had even cut ties with the two shoutcasters for the tournament, and they now say they're also suspended for six months instead.\n\n\"Moving forward, we will continue to apply tournament rules to ensure our official broadcasts remain focused on the game and are not a platform for divisive social or political views,\" said Brack. \"One of our goals at Blizzard is to make sure that every player, everywhere in the world, regardless of political views, religious beliefs, race, gender, or any other consideration always feels safe and welcome both competing in and playing our games.\"\n\nCan someone please explain which guideline my name violates? - Reddit\n\nNow that sounds well and good on paper, it's a \"neutral\" political stance. But it falls flat on its face. Partly because fans and players expect a company like Blizzard to be more than just mute bystanders when a country is in turmoil. Games are an intrinsic part of our culture now, and the way the companies behind them respond to world events matters. Especially when those events, like in the case of China's treatment of the Hong Kong protesters, goes directly against the company's espoused values.\n\nIn fact, Blizzard may have never even reduced the sentence if not for a wave of criticism against them from fans and employees alike. They've had umbrella protests in their office, pro players and casters quitting from official tournaments, not to mention hordes of players boycotting the company and its games.\n\nReuters\n\nMaybe it sort of worked. Or maybe Blizzard is just biding its time until this inevitably blows over.\n\nIn the meantime, what Blizzard is trying to say is that it still believes \"Every Voice Matters\". What it's saying in reality is, \"You should totally speak up about human rights abuse, just not on our time.\"", "description": "A week ago, Blizzard booted pro Hearthstone player Chung \u201cBlitzchung\u201d Ng Wai from a tournament, and suspended him for a year, for making a pro-Hong-Kong statement during an interview on the broadcast.
