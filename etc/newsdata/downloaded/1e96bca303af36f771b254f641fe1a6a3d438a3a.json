But the positions that Khabib is amazing at, I\u2019m equally as amazing from the bottom of the coin. I feel like if anyone\u2019s going to beat him, it\u2019s Ferguson. And if not, we\u2019re going to have to wait until I come up.\u201d\n\nNurmagomedov, who\u2019s been near flawless in all his UFC victories so far, had a brief scare in most recent outing at UFC 242 when Dustin Poirier wrapped up his neck and latched onto a guillotine choke, a move Ortega is very familiar with.\n\n\u201cT-City\u201d certainly thinks had it been him who caught Nurmagomedov in that guillotine, \u201cThe Eagle\u201d would have suffered his first career loss.\n\n\u201cI feel like anyone who I wrap up is in danger, and the level of danger is extreme,\u201d Ortega said. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for over 15 years, and I\u2019ve been going with the top-level grapplers in the entire world and finishing them, and catching them. So this is something that\u2019s in the future, for sure.\u201d\n\nAlthough it\u2019s going to take at least a couple more fights for Ortega to reach that goal, he wants to earn it, and it starts with the \u201cKorean Zombie\u201d on Dec. 21.\n\n\u201cHopefully Khabib doesn\u2019t retire,\u201d Ortega said. \u201cGive me some time to go in there and let me do what I have to do and prove myself the way he proved himself. Let me become a champ. Then I feel like I have the right to really call him out and have it be a lot more serious than just saying his name in interviews.\u201d", "description": "Brian Ortega believes if anyone can beat Khabib Nurmagomedov, it's Tony Ferguson.
