The tweet was posted by a journalist Turkey accuses of having links to a network led by a cleric who is blamed for a 2016 failed coup attempt. Turkish media reports say the journalist, Ergun Babahan, is wanted in Turkey.\n\nThe tweet drew ire from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s ruling party and as well as Bahceli\u2019s party, which are allies. Turkey\u2019s main opposition party also said it regarded the embassy\u2019s move as an insult to Turkey\u2019s parliament.\n\nThe embassy issued a second apology after Hovenier was called to the Turkish Foreign Ministry.\n\n\u201cWe do not associate ourselves with Ergun Babahan nor do we endorse or agree with the content of his tweet,\u201d the embassy\u2019s second apology read. \u201cWe reiterate our regret for this error.\u201d\n\nThe incident occurred at a time when ties between Turkey and the U.S. are strained over Syria policies. Turkey is accusing Washington of not acting fast enough toward the creation of a so-called safe zone in northeast Syria that would keep U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish fighters away from the Turkish-Syrian. Disagreements remain on the size of the zone.\n\nErdogan has threatened a unilateral intervention to drive away the Kurdish fighters.\n\nMeanwhile, Erdogan and U.S President Donald Trump agreed to meet in Washington next month to discuss the proposed safe zone, Turkish officials said following a telephone call between the two leaders.\n\nDuring the call late Sunday, the Turkish leader \u201cshared with President Trump his frustration over the U.S. military and security bureaucracy\u2019s failure to implement\u201d an agreement toward the creation of the zone, according to a statement from Erdogan\u2019s office.\n\nErdogan also told Trump that the creation of the safe zone was key to eliminating the threat posed to Turkey by the Kurdish fighters and would allow for the return of Syrian refugees, the statement said.", "description": "Turkey summoned a top American diplomat Sunday after the U.S. Embassy\u2019s official Twitter account \u201cliked\u201d a tweet that said the people of Turkey should...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS735_erdoga_ZG_20191006164304.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
