But with Syrian troops joining the fight against Turkey\u2019s onslaught \u2013 under a deal between the Kurds and Damascus, brokered by Russia \u2013 a regional power shift from Washington to Moscow is well under way.\n\nNuclear bombs. The tensions between Turkey and the Trump administration are complicated by the fact that the US has approximately 50 nuclear bombs stored at an American airbase in Turkey, which could become bargaining chips.\n\nSaudi concerns. The new Saudi ambassador to the UK has said the Turkish offensive in north-eastern Syria is a disaster that has dented Riyadh\u2019s confidence in the Trump administration.\n\nJohn Bolton \u2018sounded alarm\u2019 over Giuliani and Ukraine\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The former US national security adviser referred the issue of Giuliani\u2019s activities in Ukraine to White House lawyers. Photograph: Cliff Owen/AP\n\nJohn Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, was reportedly so alarmed by Rudy Giuliani\u2019s back-channel efforts to dig up dirt on the Bidens in Ukraine that he told one of his top aides to raise the matter with White House lawyers. Fiona Hill, formerly the administration\u2019s top expert on Russia, revealed Bolton\u2019s horror at Giuliani\u2019s shadow foreign policy in testimony to the congressional impeachment inquiry, saying Bolton told her: \u201cGiuliani\u2019s a hand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up.\u201d\n\nHunter Biden. Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter, whose links to a Ukrainian energy firm are at the heart of Giuliani\u2019s attempts to smear the former vice-president, has given an interview to ABC News that will air on Tuesday, hours before a Democratic presidential debate.\n\nTexas cop who killed Atatiana Jefferson charged with murder\n\nThe Fort Worth police officer who shot dead a black woman in her own home on Saturday has been charged with murder. Atatiana Jefferson, 28, was killed in her bedroom when officer Aaron Dean fired at her through a window. Body camera footage released by police shows that Dean, who had arrived at Jefferson\u2019s home to conduct a welfare check, had not parked in front of the house, did not identify himself, and appears to have given her no time to respond to his initial command before opening fire.\n\n\u2018Wellness call\u2019. Jefferson had been playing video games with her eight-year-old nephew, Zion, when she was killed. The family\u2019s lawyer, Lee Merritt, said: \u201cIt\u2019s beyond me to begin to understand what kind of police force responds to a wellness call with the equivalent of Swat.\u201d\n\nWeWork set to sack 2,000 staff after IPO fiasco\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A WeWork office space in San Francisco. Photograph: Kate Munsch/Reuters\n\nThe office rental firm WeWork, until recently America\u2019s most highly valued private company, is expected to sack as many as 2,000 of its 15,000 staff as it tries to staunch massive losses and contain the fallout from a failed IPO. Though WeWork declined to comment, the Guardian obtained online chats among its staff, where much internal ire is being directed at co-founder Adam Neumann, who cashed in $700m of his own shares before the IPO was pulled in September, amid skepticism from prospective investors.\n\nCancer risk. In a further headache for the firm, WeWork has been forced to close about 2,300 phone booths at its north American office spaces, after discovering elevated levels of formaldehyde that could pose a cancer risk.\n\nCheat sheet\n\nSeveral high-profile figures have criticised Trump for failing to condemn a violent video , shown at an event for supporters at his Florida resort, which depicts the president shooting and stabbing dozens of his political opponents and media outlets.\n\nThe Booker Prize for fiction has been split between two winners for the first time in almost 30 years, after judges were unable to choose between Margaret Atwood\u2019s The Testaments and Girl, Woman, Other by Bernardine Evaristo.\n\nSelf-reported suicide attempts among black teenagers in the US have increased by 73% since the early 1990s, according to a study published in the medical journal Pediatrics.\n\nRussian investigators have staged nationwide raids on more than 200 offices belonging to the country\u2019s political opposition, as the Kremlin ramps up pressure on leading Putin critic Alexei Navalny and his allies.\n\nMust-reads\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tim Pegues at his home in Chicago: \u2018A lot of people don\u2019t think $5 is a lot of money. But if you don\u2019t have it, it\u2019s like a million dollars.\u2019 Photograph: Laura McDermott\n\nThe Americans haunted by zombie debt\n\nTens of thousands of people have received demands from a faceless bureaucracy to repay alleged overpayments of government benefits, some of them decades old. For the Guardian\u2019s Automating Poverty series, Virginia Eubanks met the Americans struggling with zombie debt.\n\nDemocrats battle for the suburbs in 2020\n\nThe latest Democratic presidential debate is taking place on Tuesday night in Westerville, Ohio, an affluent suburb north-east of the state capital, Columbus. Westerville, and other suburbs like it, will be \u201cground zero\u201d in 2020, the experts tell Lauren Gambino.\n\nThe prescience and power of Fight Club, 20 years on\n\nWhen David Fincher\u2019s film adaptation of Fight Club arrived in cinemas in 1999, it generated widespread concern that it might inspire impressionable young men to commit violent acts. Two decades later, says Scott Tobias, its satirical ambiguities seem more like a warning than an incitement.\n\nThomas Chatterton Williams: how and why to \u2018unlearn race\u2019\n\nAfter years of examining race categories, the American writer Thomas Chatterton Williams has come to identify as an ex-black man. Being black in America \u201cis a category that\u2019s been hurting my family for generations,\u201d he tells Summer Sewell, \u201cbut it\u2019s not a real category and our society is damaged by insisting on it.\u201d\n\nOpinion\n\nThe US, UK and Australian governments have asked Facebook to create a \u201cbackdoor\u201d to its encrypted messaging apps. If their wish is granted, says Edward Snowden, it would render our private communications \u2013 and our public infrastructure \u2013 permanently unsafe.\n\nIt is striking that when a company as potentially dangerous as Facebook appears to be at least publicly willing to implement technology that makes users safer by limiting its own power, it is the US government that cries foul. This is because the government would suddenly become less able to treat Facebook as a convenient trove of private lives.\n\nSport\n\nLeBron James has waded into the spat between the NBA and China by suggesting the Houston Rockets general manager, Daryl Morey, \u201cwasn\u2019t educated on the situation\u201d when he tweeted in support of pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. James later clarified that he was referring to Morey\u2019s grasp of the potential consequences of his tweet, not the substance of his views on Hong Kong.\n\nThe Washington Nationals are just one game away from granting their city its first World Series appearance in 86 years, after crushing the St Louis Cardinals 8-1 on Monday night to take a 3-0 lead in the NL Championship Series.\n\nSign up\n\nThe US morning briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.
