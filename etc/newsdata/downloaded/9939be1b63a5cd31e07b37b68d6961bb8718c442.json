Adult human female.\u2019\n\nThe guidelines, which judges and magistrates must follow unless they can show doing so would run against justice, are the first to apply to public order offences \u2013 which include the offence of \u2018stirring up hatred based on race, religion or sexual orientation\u2019.\n\nThis is the only public order offence for which offenders can be convicted for what they say, write, broadcast or post on the internet or social media.\n\nMost cases of hate crime sentenced in the courts are convictions for ordinary offences \u2013 considered aggravated \u2013 because the criminal targeted a victim from a minority group.\n\nThe Sentencing Council said the least serious offences of stirring up racial hatred, in which people spread hate \u2018recklessly\u2019 without intending to do so, should be handed community punishments rather than jail time.\n\nBut the same does not apply to spreading hatred on religious or sexual orientation grounds.\n\nAbuse claims reach record 100,000 a year The number of hate crimes reported to police has reached 100,000 a year for the first time. Home Office figures showed a 10 per cent increase this year, with a surge in allegations of homophobic and transphobic abuse. Police must record an incident as a hate crime if a victim believes they were targeted over their race, religion, sexual orientation, disability or because they are transgender. There were 103,379 such reports in England and Wales in 2018/19, up from just over 94,000 in the previous 12 months. Transgender hate crimes jumped 37 per cent, to 2,333, and there were 14,500 cases involving sexual orientation, an increase of 25 per cent. The number of incidents has more than doubled since 2012/13 when just 42,255 hate crimes were logged. The Home Office said the rise was partly down to improvements in recording methods, but admitted it could also reflect a \u2018real rise\u2019 in crime levels. There were 79,000 reports of race hate crimes, up 11 per cent, and incidents involving religious hate rose 3 per cent to 8,500.\n\nFor these offences, the new rules say the least serious offences should attract a six-month jail sentence.\n\nFor those who commit the hate crime from a position of authority, or plan to incite serious violence or whose activity was persistent and widespread, the typical jail sentence should be three years and as much as six.\n\nBy contrast, the Council\u2019s rules mean burglars can avoid jail with a community sentence.\n\nThe Council said it wanted to reassure \u2018concerned respondents the guideline is not politically influenced or motivated\u2019.\n\nBut prison charity The Howard League criticised judges for advocating short jail terms.\n\nIt told the Council\u2019s consultation: \u2018The guidelines should be encouraging the use of effective community programmes rather than expensive, ineffective short-term prison sentences.\u2019", "description": "Offenders found guilty of stirring up hatred on the grounds of sexuality should get at least six months in prison, new sentencing guidelines state.", "authors": ["Steve Doughty For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/23/19762842-0-image-a-58_1571179872045.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
