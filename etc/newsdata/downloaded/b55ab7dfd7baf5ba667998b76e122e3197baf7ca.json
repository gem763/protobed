The Ukraine texts! Chuck Todd melts down! Republicans break with Trump!\n\nJust like the media\u2019s phony Australia freak-out earlier this week, on Thursday, the fake news media hit us with round after round of sound and fury signifying nothing.\n\nAs the Ukraine Hoax loses steam, as those of us keeping our heads discover that the Democrats\u2019 decision to cock the impeachment gun before seeing the transcript of the Ukraine call is turning into one of the greatest political blunders since John McCain canceled his presidential campaign to save the economy, the fake news media are hoping to cover up this pratfall with empty hysteria.\n\nLet\u2019s take Thursday\u2019s examples one-by-one, starting with the stupidest first\u2026\n\nChuck Todd\u2019s Face Melts Because the Constitution, or Something\u2026\n\nLike a 12-year-old girl who just saw a mouse, Todd ran around screaming about democracy n\u2019 stuff with this hysterical and hysterically funny monologue:\n\nI don\u2019t say this lightly. Let\u2019s be frank, a national nightmare is upon us. The basic rules of our democracy are under attack from the president. We begin tonight with a series of admissions by the president that all but ensure his impeachment in the House of Representatives. It\u2019s a moment of truth for Republicans, and they have been largely silent on what we have seen from the president. Today he publicly called on two foreign governments to interfere in the presidential election by investigating his chief 2020 political rival.\n\nTodd\u2019s opener is a flat-out lie. He doesn\u2019t \u201ctake this lightly?\u201d What are we, idiots\u2026? These left-wing liars claim our \u201cdemocracy is under attack\u201d every time a Republican defends himself, and they\u2019ve been saying this about Trump for four years now!\n\nSecond verse, same as the first\u2026\n\nSeriously, fuck off.\n\nTrump Spoke to China About Joe Biden!!!\n\nHere\u2019s far-left CNN\u2019s big, fat, fake headline\u2026 \u201cTrump raised Biden with Xi in June call housed in highly secure server.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s especially hilarious about this particular piece of propaganda (sorry, I don\u2019t link fake news) is that it took five \u2014 five! \u2014 so-called reporters to gin up this nonsense.\n\nBut do you see what\u2019s going on here? The headline is designed to 1) give us the impression Trump did a quid pro quo with China to investigate a political rival, and 2) then engaged in a \u201ccover up\u201d by hiding the call in this secure server.\n\nExcept for the fact that nothing close to that is true, this is really big news!\n\nHere\u2019s what actually happened on this call, which is only revealed after three paragraphs of CNN\u2019s spin:\n\nDuring a phone call with Xi on June 18, Trump raised Biden\u2019s political prospects as well as those of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who by then had started rising in the polls, according to two people familiar with the discussion. In that call, Trump also told Xi he would remain quiet on Hong Kong protests as trade talks progressed.\n\nSo all Trump did was shoot the breeze.\n\nAs far as this super-secret server that we\u2019re supposed to believe covers up all of Trump\u2019s impeachable offenses goes\u2026 Obama used the same server for his calls.\n\nSo once again, you have the fake news media dressing up a non-story, a big zero into a BOMBSHELL.\n\nThe Texts! The Texts! The Texts Smoke Like a Gun!\n\nADDED: We now know that the Taylor\u2019s text lamenting how it\u2019s \u201ccrazy to withhold security assistance\u201d was prompted by a Politico article, not something going on in the White House. So this BOMBSHELL is even dumber than I originally believed.\n\nFar-left ABC News, which has already poured Ukrainian fake news over itself and lit itself on fire, hit us with this latest BOMBSHELL: \u201c\u2018Crazy to withhold security assistance\u2019 to Ukraine for political campaign: Top US diplomat.\u201d (Sorry again, but I don\u2019t link fake news.)\n\nOh, boy, they got Drumpf now!\n\nThe walls are really closing in this time!\n\nExcept, not.\n\nThe full context of the text messages are what you call \u2026 exculpatory. Here\u2019s some real journalism courtesy of Breitbart News:\n\nNewly disclosed text messages show Gordon Sondland, the United States Ambassador to the European Union, defended President Donald Trump\u2019s July 25 telephone call with the leader of Ukraine, affirming the president has said \u201cno quid pro quo of any kind\u201d took place between the heads of state, according to a report. On Thursday, ABC News published excerpts of the texts in which Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine, wrote to Sondland, \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d seemingly a reference to allegations brought forward by a partisan CIA officer in a complaint that stated the president sought to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the business ties of Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President and 2020 White House hopeful Joe Biden.\n\nMore:\n\n\u201cI believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions,\u201d Sondland wrote in a message to Taylor. \u201cThe president has been crystal clear: no quid pro quo of any kind. The president is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during the campaign.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, according to NUMEROUS reports, Ukraine did not 1) feel pressured at all, and 2) was expecting the U.S. aid to continue at the time of the call.\n\nRepublicans BREAK WITH TRUMP on Whistleblower!!\n\nOMFG, Republicans are BREAKING WITH Trump!\n\nHe\u2019s doomed!\n\nHis presidency is DOOMED!\n\nExcept, yeah, no\u2026 NBC News is gonna NBC News.\n\nAll Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) said was, \u201cWhistleblowers should be protected. I stand with Chuck Grassley on this. We have laws in place.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not \u201cbreaking with\u201d Trump.\n\nBuried in the story is the following: \u201cErnst, who\u2019s facing re-election next year, said last week she wasn\u2019t concerned about the substance of the call. \u2018I\u2019ve looked at the transcript; I don\u2019t see anything there,'\u201d she said at a town hall event.\n\nSo no one is \u201cbreaking with\u201d Trump.\n\nMan alive.\n\n\u2014\n\nWith the Ukraine Hoax coming apart like a cheap sweater, this is how the media believe they can cover that fact up, by making up scandals out of whole cloth, out of hyperbolic monologues and headlines that don\u2019t hold up to what little factual reporting there is buried underneath the phony headline.\n\nThey got nothing.\n\nThey know they got nothing.\n\nBut they believe they can fool voters by holding up a banana and screaming about it being a smoking gun.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
