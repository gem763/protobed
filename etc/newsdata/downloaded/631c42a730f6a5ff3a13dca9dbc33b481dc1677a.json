NRA-backed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), who has long opposed any such progress, said Tuesday he will wait and see if Trump actually means any of the things he said in public before scheduling any Senate votes.\n\nAfter mass shootings in El Paso, Texas; Dayton, Ohio; and Gilroy, California, left dozens of people dead, Trump \u2014 who benefited from more than $29 million in NRA spending in his 2016 race \u2014 initially said he wanted to ensure that all gun purchases required background checks.\n\n\u201cFrankly, we need intelligent background checks,\u201d Trump told reporters in early August. \u201cI spoke to Mitch McConnell yesterday\u2026. He is totally on board,\u201d the president claimed.\n\n\u2026.mentally ill or deranged people. I am the biggest Second Amendment person there is, but we all must work together for the good and safety of our Country. Common sense things can be done that are good for everyone! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 9, 2019\n\nBut after speaking with NRA officials, Trump changed his tune. Later in August, he reminded the nation that \u201cwe already have a lot of background checks.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on Tuesday \u2014 days after another mass shooting in Odessa, Texas, left at least seven people dead \u2014 McConnell made it clear he doesn\u2019t believe Trump\u2019s public statements mean much of anything. McConnell said he would wait and see where the president landed before committing to anything.\n\nThe self-described Senate \u201cgrim reaper\u201d typically blocks all legislation from even coming up for a vote, and said that a \u201cdiscussion about what to do on the gun issue in the wake of these horrendous shootings\u201d is ongoing.\n\n\u201cI said several weeks ago that if the president took a position on the bill so that we knew we would actually be making a law and not just having serial votes, I\u2019d be happy to put it on the floor,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cThe administration is in the process of studying what they\u2019re prepared to support, if anything, and I expect to get an answer to that this week. If the president is in favor of a number of things he has discussed openly and publicly and I know we will pass it and it\u2019ll become law, I\u2019ll put it on the floor.\u201d\n\nMcConnell once objected to presidents who do not actually support the things they say they support in public. In 1993, when giving his party\u2019s response to President Bill Clinton\u2019s weekly radio address, McConnell \u2014 then in his second six-year Senate term \u2014 complained, \u201cDuring the presidential campaign, Bill Clinton promised to reinvent government. Instead, Clinton has spent the last three months reinventing his campaign promises.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1138442092.jpg?w=1024&h=741&crop=1"}
