When it comes to interviewing world-famous personalities, the Muppets require a few special accommodations (they also brought their own pop-up chairs). But in many ways they were like a lot of big stars: They wanted to know the questions in advance. And they hit their marks.\n\nElmo and Abby Cadabby came to the New York Times studio recently to talk about the alphabet song. It\u2019s a tune that, in its 50 years on the air, \u201cSesame Street\u201d has covered a lot \u2014 with Muppets and celebrities, in dance numbers and ear-wormy songs, like Usher\u2019s \u201cABCs of Moving You,\u201d which has nearly 115 million YouTube views.\n\nMusic has been a part of the \u201cSesame Street\u201d DNA since the show was developed in the late \u201960s, and its legacy with artists is remarkable : It counts Stevie Wonder, Katy Perry, Nina Simone and Romeo Santos among its alums, and continues inspiring audiences and musicians, of many ages, today.", "description": "It isn\u2019t easy to remake the alphabet song over and over.
