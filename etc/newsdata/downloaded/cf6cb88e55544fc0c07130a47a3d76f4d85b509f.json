SoftBank has pumped almost $11bn (\u00a38.8bn) into the We Company, the parent company of WeWork, and holds about 30% of the shares.\n\nRon Fisher, SoftBank\u2019s vice-chairman, sits on the WeWork board, alongside Mark Schwartz, a former SoftBank board member. It is unclear how many of the seven board members support the effort to force Neumann to step down as chief executive. SoftBank and WeWork declined to comment.\n\nEven if a majority of WeWork board members support the ousting of Neumann, he could still overrule them because his shares have 10 times the voting rights of other shareholders and he has the power to replace board members. Sources suggested to Reuters that SoftBank was proposing to ask Neumann to become interim chief executive while a headhunting firm was hired to find an external replacement. The Wall Street Journal first reported on Sunday that SoftBank was trying to oust Neumann as chief executive.\n\nNeumann, 40, who founded the shared office provider with his friend Miguel McKelvey in 2010, last week admitted to staff that he had been \u201chumbled\u201d by Wall Street\u2019s lukewarm reaction to his plans for an initial public offering (IPO).\n\nThe company\u2019s expected IPO valuation had already more than halved from the $47bn placed on it when SoftBank pumped in money in the latest funding round in January. The IPO was officially postponed on 16 September, after some bankers suggested it might attract a valuation as low as $15bn.\n\nNeumann had been heavily criticised by investors and corporate governance experts for seeking to force through very unusual arrangements that would have given him disproportionate control of the firm.\n\nIn its initial IPO documents Neumann had called for his shares to carry 20 times the votes of ordinary shares, and for his wife to have a say in selecting his successor should he die. The documents also initially showed that WeWork\u2019s board would include no women. Anger from potential investors caused WeWork to change all of these policies, cutting his voting rights to 10 times those of other investors, removing his wife\u2019s role from succession planning, and adding Frances Frei, an academic at Harvard Business School, to its board.\n\nNeumann also repaid $5.9m that the company had paid him in exchange for his trademark of the word \u201cWe\u201d.\n\nIn a sign of the deteriorating relations between SoftBank and WeWork, Neumann did not participate in a gathering of executives of companies backed by SoftBank in Pasadena, California, last week.", "description": "Board is to discuss his future after questions over behaviour and cancelled flotation", "authors": ["Rupert Neate", "Nils Pratley", "Filipa Pajevi\u0107"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e50f2faa656e130ac477eb2e4eb3a300c0e76e99/0_211_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1baf579e646c052d4e572cede7803023", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
