Reuters/Andrew Boyers\n\nVirat Kohli won his third successive toss of the series but the Indian top order could not make the most of it with the exception of Rohit Sharma who was batting on 38 at the break.\n\nAjinkya Rahane was giving him company on 11 and the Mumbai duo will hope to rebuild the innings after the early jolts as India seek to consolidate their place atop the World Test Championship table with a series whitewash.\n\nVisiting captain Faf du Plessis turned up with team mate Temba Bavuma as proxy skipper for flipping of the coin but South Africa still lost their 10th toss in a row in India.\n\nArmed with the new ball, Rabada made the most of the morning conditions, bowling fuller and generating enough swing to trouble the batsmen.\n\nOne of those drew Mayank Agarwal out to edge to slip where Dean Elgar took a low catch to dismiss the in-form opener.\n\nIndia\u2019s number three Cheteshwar Pujara survived a leg before appeal against Rabada who was excited but du Plessis wisely decided against reviewing the not-out decision.\n\nNext time Rabada hit Pujara on the pad, the bowler\u2019s conviction prompted du Plessis to challenge the not-out decision and they were rewarded with the wicket of the scoreless batsman.\n\nRabada was celebrating his third success of the morning when Rohit was adjudged lbw but the opener immediately reviewed the decision which was reversed after replays confirmed an inside edge.\n\nAnrich Nortje, playing his second test, struck the biggest blow when he trapped Kohli leg before for 12. The home captain reviewed the decision but could not get it overturned.\n\nIndia Spinner Shahbaz Nadeem made his test debut replacing quick Ishant Sharma, while stumper Heinrich Klaasen and left-arm spinner George Linde also earned their maiden test caps for South Africa.", "description": "Kagiso Rabada bowled with unbridled hostility to wreck India's top order and help reduce the hosts to 71 for three wickets at lunch on the opening day of the third and final test in Ranchi on Saturday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442639073&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I08S-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
