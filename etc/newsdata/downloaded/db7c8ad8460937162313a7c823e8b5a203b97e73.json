In many cases, the students have an outstanding study account, which causes the withholding of results.\n\nAnother 40% of youth think that they did not achieve a qualification after they dropped out and they simply do not know how to find out whether they are entitled to a qualification.\n\nIn the latter class, students have studied towards a professional exam and that some colleges withhold the fact that the student have passed the professional exam and are, therefore, entitled to a qualification.\n\nIn addition, some colleges mix and match professional qualifications with internal programs and refuse to award a qualification even though the student has met all the requirements of the professional examination body. In this case, qualifications are withheld because a student may not have completed a small fraction of the internal program.\n\nStudents who studied a NATED (N3, N4, N5 and N6) are often not awarded these qualifications because the students have not completed specific practical course requirements.\n\nNo matter what the case, the fact remains that students who wrote certain professional exams are not aware that they actually met all the requirements of the professional examining body. Such people need help to right a glaring social injustice.\n\nThe South African youth are not aware that they could make use of a Recognition of Prior Learning intervention so that they could be considered for an alternative qualification.\n\nThis sort of intervention is not a magic bullet that will transform an incomplete qualification in an alternative full qualification.\n\nBut the Growth Institute\u2019s research has shown that 55% of youth who wrote some professional exam need only three more credits to be awarded a qualification at a specific level.\n\nWe are committed to help the South African youth get what they deserve.\n\n\u2022 Peter van Nieuwenhuizen is chief financial officer at the Growth Institute, a private college in Johannesburg", "description": "Every year, thousands of South African youth drop out of university or college with an incomplete qualification.", "authors": ["Peter Van Nieuwenhuizen"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4624/d46df70a8e64470c86f226fbbe333992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
