On Friday, the company pushed out iOS 13.1.1 with a few bug fixes \u2014 and iOS 13.1 had only just launched on September 24th. Fast-forward to today, and Apple is already rolling out iOS 13.1.2 and iPadOS 13.1.2. It\u2019s getting a little hard to keep these things straight.\n\nThe newest update addresses a handful of issues impacting iCloud backups, the camera (\u201cfixes an issue where camera may not work\u201d), flashlight, Bluetooth, and the HomePod. It also patches up an unusual bug that \u201ccould result in a loss of display calibration data.\u201d You wouldn\u2019t want that happening to your new iPhone 11 Pro display, now would you?\n\nYou should be able to find the latest iOS and iPadOS update now by going to Settings -> General -> Software Update. These rapid-fire bug fixes are a key benefit of Apple\u2019s control over both iPhone / iPad hardware and software. It\u2019s unfortunate that iOS 13 shipped with some of these issues for that customers have encountered, but Apple is wasting no time in addressing them.", "description": "Apple is updating iOS 13 at a breakneck pace.
