'One caller had told us to look for basically a depression under the carcass cause he said that the alien ships will kinda beam the cow up and do whatever they are going to do with it. Then they just drop them from a great height.'\n\nThree bulls from the Silvies Valley Ranch were killed in early August and another two were killed throughout the summer. Oregon ranchers are stumped by the mysterious deaths\n\nThe ranch is roughly the size of Chicago, making it difficult to monitor the whereabouts of the bulls\n\nBut that certainly is the craziest theory being touted by the community.\n\nJenkins added: 'Another one told us we should run like a geiger counter type thing around the animal and guarantees that there would be radiation there. And the number one on the list there, he thinks it's the North Vietnamese army.'\n\nThe firs three bulls had their anal areas cut out and also had their tongues and testicles removed, according to the report. One was also missing its penis and the tip of its ear.\n\nThe sheriff's office determined that the three deaths took place at different times and deputies could not locate any bullets at the scene.\n\nTwo more bulls from the ranch - which is roughly the size of Chicago - were also said to have been killed.\n\nColby Marshall, the vice president at the ranch, told the NW News Network that the bulls were just reaching their prime. Marshall voiced his concern at the loss of funds from each bull killing - roughly $7000 a beast\n\nColby Marshall, the vice president at the ranch, told the NW News Network that the bulls were just reaching their prime. Marshall voiced his concern at the loss of funds from each bull killing - roughly $7000 a beast.\n\nOne carcass still remained on the frontier by mid-March and Marshall believes the killings are a part of a coordinated effort.\n\n'It's rugged,' Marshall explained. 'I mean this is the frontier. \u2026 If some person, or persons, has the ability to take down a 2,000-pound range bull, you know, it's not inconceivable that they wouldn't have a lot of problems dealing with a 180-pound cowboy.'\n\nStaff at the ranch are now required to ride in pairs and carry firearms when they are out on the frontier.\n\nThe sheriff's office is continuing with their investigation and the Oregon Cattleman's Association has offered a $25,000 reward for anyone with information pertaining to the killing of the bulls. They had initially only offered $1000 when there were just three casualties\n\nThe sheriff's office is continuing with their investigation and the Oregon Cattleman's Association has offered a $25,000 reward for anyone with information pertaining to the killing of the bulls.\n\nMysterious bull killings are not new to the Northwest state.\n\nIn 2017, a couple stumbled upon a freshly killed beast just outside of Princeton, Oregon. Andie Davies and her husband tried to determine how the bull got to that location.\n\nDavies' son, a butcher, also examined the animal and could not determine what killed it.", "description": "Harney County Sheriff's Office first reported on August 1 that three bulls from the Silvies Valley Ranch had been shot in the head.
