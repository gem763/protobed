An autopsy report concluded the man died of severe coronary artery atherosclerosis, according to the Sacramento Bee.\n\nFire personnel responded to the call around 3:40 a.m., according to Chief Lloyd Ogan. They found Mardis unresponsive on the floor of his home. He was found wearing a nasal cannula, used to deliver oxygen to the nose, and was hooked up to a PPAP machine for that purpose. The family told Fox 40 he couldn\u2019t reach his battery-powered tank in time.\n\nCALIFORNIA BANS PRIVATE PRISONS AND IMMIGRANT DETENTION CENTERS\n\nCalifornia\u2019s largest utility company instituted blackouts for its customers beginning Wednesday to prevent high winds from toppling power lines, which could cause deadly wildfires like the one last year in Paradise, which left 85 people dead. That fire was attributed to PG&E equipment.\n\nFrustrations ran at an all-time high as around 700,000 customers went without power Experts said there are around two to three actual people per customer, or almost 2 million California residents. About half of those who lost power in the San Francisco Bay Area had it back by Friday.\n\nFor most it was a major inconvenience, but for Mardis, it may have had a deadly unintended consequence. PG&E spokeswoman Brandi Merlo said Friday that the company did not have any details about the death and had not substantiated it. But California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who\u2019s been critical of the service provider\u2019s actions, called the death \u201cdevastating beyond words.\u201d\n\n\u201cLosing a family member is horrific and to the extent this was the reason why, I hope that is investigated and I hope those responsible are held to account,\" he said, according to The Sacramento Bee.\n\nCALIFORNIA SIGNS MEASURE REQUIRING UNIVERSITIES TO PROVIDE ABORTION MEDS\n\nPG&E offers a \u201cmedical baseline\u201d to customers, allowing them discounted rates and advance notice of public safety power shutoffs. It\u2019s unclear whether Mardish was such a customer.\n\nNewsom has said PG&E\u2019s power cuts are an issue of its own making, arguing that the company should have been working on making its power system sturdier and more weatherproof.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPG&E said in a statement that employees located 11 spots where parts of its systems were damaged due to strong winds, but did not provide any details. That information will be in a state-mandated report the utility must give regulators within 10 days after the outage ends.\n\nFox News' Travis Fedschun contributed to this report.", "description": "A Northern California man dependent on oxygen supply died Wednesday just after power cuts\u00a0from Pacific Gas and Electric Co. affected his home, fire officials said Friday.", "authors": ["Morgan Phillips"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/pge_3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
