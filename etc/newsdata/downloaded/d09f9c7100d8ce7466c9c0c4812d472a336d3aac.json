With Manu Tuilagi shifting to outside centre, Henry Slade drops out of the starting XV.\n\nThe England head coach has decided against changing his pack though, despite the threat of the All Blacks\u2019 reinforced lineout after Steve Hansen named an additional lock in the back row in the form of Scott Barrett. It means that Courtney Lawes continues in the second row with Maro Itoje, with George Kruis on the bench.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Rugby World Cup semi-final: England vs New Zealand predicted team 1/24 England vs New Zealand Here's the team Eddie Jones should select for the Rugby World Cup semi-final against New Zealand. AFP via Getty Images 2/24 1. Mako Vunipola After coming through his first start in five months last weekend with flying colours, Eddie Jones knows he has one of his genuine world class players to call upon from the start. Vunipola completely changes the way that England\u2019s pack are able to impose themselves on the opposition, which enables the likes of Billy Vunipola and Manu Tuilagi to reap the benefits. AFP via Getty Images 3/24 2. Jamie George Has a point to prove after the criticism he received following his struggles against the All Blacks last November. England\u2019s lineout has been lauded by this correspondent as currently the best in the world \u2013 now it\u2019s time for them to prove it. Getty Images 4/24 3. Kyle Sinckler His excellent display against Australia felt like a breakout performance that will have filled him with confidence ahead of what will be the biggest game of his career since the Lions tour. Sinckler is proving one of the gems in the pack that is proving his class by the minute. Getty Images, 5/24 4. Maro Itoje If New Zealand could have one player from the England side in their squad, it would be Itoje. The dynamic forward has been one of England\u2019s most consistent performers in Japan and has led their turnover charts, proving what a thorn he is in the backside of opponents. AFP via Getty Images 6/24 5. George Kruis He has swapped places with Courtney Lawes throughout the tournament and I\u2019d expect no different for this occasion, given the emphasis that Eddie Jones has put on the lineout. Kruis also brings extra bulk in the carrying department. Getty Images 7/24 6. Tom Curry Man of the match against Australia at the age of 21, Curry now has a target on his back that the Kiwis will have spotted. His place could have been at risk in order to play Courtney Lawes to strengthen the lineout, but breaking up the \u2018Undercurry\u2019 duo would be a travesty. Getty Images, 8/24 7. Sam Underhill The second part of England\u2019s dynamic flank duo, Underhill has proven worth his weight in gold in Japan, having formed a back-row of the likes that England have never seen before. Getty Images, 9/24 8. Billy Vunipola With fitness concerns and burnout fears done and dusted, Vunipola is the easy choice at No 8. AFP via Getty Images 10/24 9. Ben Youngs One of the survivors of the victorious 2012 team, Youngs has had a good World Cup up until now, but he will need to be at his very best to outshine opposite number Aaron Smith. AFP via Getty Images 11/24 10. George Ford A surprise choice, but one that makes sense. New Zealand lack a big ball-carrier in the centre unless they select Sonny Bill Williams, which given how Steve Hansen has gone this tour looks unlikely. In which case, England need the creativity that Ford and Farrell bring together. AFP via Getty Images 12/24 11. Jonny May There\u2019s a big concern over his hamstring, but if\u2019s he\u2019s close to fully fit May is worth the gamble. He proved his lethal finishing ability against the Wallabies, and the All Blacks know what he can do given his famous try at Twickenham in 2014. Getty 13/24 12. Owen Farrell The move to inside centre would be a surprise, but Farrell appeared to regain his confidence last weekend as displayed by his 100 per cent kicking ability. His appearance in this week\u2019s press conference said as much, and it\u2019s worth remembering that he and Ford know what to do together. Getty Images, 14/24 13. Manu Tuilagi Can he rekindle the 2012 Manu Tuilagi that blew New Zealand away? His recent form suggests he could well do so, and New Zealand know they need to hatch a plan to contain him when he\u2019s given the space out wide. Getty Images, 15/24 14. Anthony Watson The wing utilised his footwork supremely well against Australia, and having been faced with the powerhouse that was Marika Koroibete last week, George Bridge should be a welcome release. Getty Images, 16/24 15. Elliot Daly Jones\u2019s go-to man at full-back, Daly needs something closer to what he produced against Argentina than the Australia game. AFP via Getty Images 17/24 16. Luke Cowan-Dickie AFP via Getty Images 18/24 17. Joe Marler Getty Images 19/24 18. Dan Cole AFP/Getty Images 20/24 19. Courtney Lawes AFP via Getty Images 21/24 20.

It has helped having players here who have been on the Lions tour and played against New Zealand. They have been involved in some of the biggest games in world rugby so this semi-final won\u2019t faze them.\n\n\u201cNew Zealand are a great team, they have an impressive winning record since the last Rugby World Cup. Like any good team, you have to take away time and space from them and you have to find areas you can pressure them. We believe we have identified a number of areas where we can do that.\u201d\n\nMako Vunipola will continue at loosehead prop in an unchanged front row with Jamie George and Kyle Sinckler, with Itoje and Lawes providing the muscle behind them. Tom Curry continues in his new blindside flanker role with Sam Underhill at openside, and they\u2019re joined in the back row by No 8 Billy Vunipola, who will win his 50th cap on Saturday.\n\n\u201cIt is a great achievement for Billy to reach 50 Test matches for England and something that is very special for the team,\u201d Jones added. \u201cI know his family will be very proud of him and even more so to play the game alongside his brother Mako.\u201d\n\nBen Youngs continues at scrum-half with Ford, Farrell and Tuilagi outside him, and the back three is unchanged with Jonny May coming through a fitness test to retain his place on the left wing, with Anthony Watson in the No 14 shirt and Elliot Daly at full-back.\n\nJack Nowell misses out on a place in the squad despite returning to full training, with Jonathan Joseph joining Slade and Willi Heinz as backs cover \u2013 the latter overcoming a niggling injury this week to feature. Wilson meanwhile covers the back row, with Luke Cowan-Dickie, Joe Marler, Dan Cole and Kruis all retained from the Wallabies victory.\n\nTeams\n\nEngland: Elliot Daly; Anthony Watson, Manu Tuilagi, Owen Farrell, Jonny May; George Ford, Ben Youngs; Mako Vunipola, Jamie George, Kyle Sinckler; Maro Itoje, Courtney Lawes; Tom Curry, Sam Underhill, Billy Vunipola.\n\nReplacements: Luke Cowan-Dickie, Joe Marler, Dan Cole, George Kruis, Mark Wilson, Willi Heinz, Henry Slade, Jonathan Joseph.\n\nNew Zealand: Beauden Barrett; Sevu Reece, Jack Goodhue, Anton Lienert-Brown, George Bridge; Richie Mo'unga, Aaron Smith; Joe Moody, Codie Taylor, Nepo Laulala; Brodie Retallick, Sam Whitelock; Scott Barrett, Ardie Savea, Kieran Read.\n\nReplacements: Dane Coles, Ofa Tuungafasi, Angus Ta'avao, Patrick Tuipulotu, Sam Cane, TJ Perenara, Sonny Bill Williams, Jordie Barrett.", "description": "George Ford will start Saturday\u2019s Rugby World Cup semi-final against New Zealand\u00a0alongside Owen Farrell after the pair were reunited by Eddie Jones in the England\u00a0midfield.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/23/15/George-Ford.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
