Morgan\u2019s equity strategist, Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, in a Thursday research note.\n\nMomentum stocks are those which have seen the largest price gains in the recent past. For instance, the top holdings of the iShares Edge MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF MTUM, -0.55% include, as of Sept. 12, Proctor and Gamble Co. , PG, -0.50% Mastercard Inc. MA, +0.26% , Visa Inc V, -0.47% and Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.11% , all of which have gained more than 33% year-to-date, versus the S&P 500 index\u2019s 20% rise.\n\nValue stocks are those which have low valuations based on measures like price-to-earnings or price-to-book value. The iShares Edge MSCI USA Value Factor ETF \u2018s VLUE, +0.28% top holdings include AT&T Inc. T, -1.51% , Intel Corp. INTC, -0.99% and International Business Machines Co. IBM, +0.00%. It has an average trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 11.47, versus the S&P 500\u2019s roughly 18.4, according to FactSet data.\n\nWhile MTUM has outperformed VLUE year-to-date, that began to change in August and VLUE\u2019s rally has accelerated month-to-date, as its risen 7.4.%, versus a 2.8% rise for the S&P 500 SPX, -0.03% and a 0.2% decline for MTUM.\n\nFactSet\n\nValue stocks, by definition, are undervalued, and it can be easy to fall into the thinking that \u201cwhat goes down must go up\u201d, but the relative valuation of these stocks has hit record lows of late, to the point that some mean reversion was likely.\n\nJason Williams, portfolio manager at Lazard Asset Management told MarketWatch that value stocks have not been this cheap since at least 1999, while other characteristics of many high-momentum stocks should cause investors concern. He pointed out that an increasing share of momentum stocks are young companies that are achieving fast revenue growth, \u201cbut not the profits to back it up.\u201d\n\nSuch companies include Workday Inc. WDAY, -1.39%, Shopify Inc. SHOP, -4.19% , UBER, -2.66% , and Beyond Meat Inc. BYND, +1.55% , Williams said. \u201cThese companies have low or no profits, but investors are prepared to be patient because they seem to be disrupting a way of business,\u201d he said. \u201cThe sheer number of these companies that aren\u2019t generating any profit, we are at the same level where we were in 1999.\u201d\n\nLazard Asset Management\n\nThis data may suggest that momentum stocks are long overdue for a correction, but Williams said the catalyst for a sustained rally in value stocks could be the trajectory of the economy and Federal Reserve reactions to it. An economy that slows considerably in the next 6 to 8 months will invite an aggressive response from the Fed, as it cuts short-term interest rates to boost economic activity. Lower interest rates today would steepen the yield curve, or the spread between long-term rates and short-term ones.\n\nSuch a scenario would be bearish for the increasing share of companies that are high growth but low profit, as a weaker economy would put that growth at risk, and higher rates would reduce the net present value of future profits. \u201cI think we could see a scenario where markets steadily fall like they did in the early 2000s, but where underneath the surface you had parts of the market that are rising or treading water,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt could lead to an ongoing, consistent rotation out of growth and into value.\u201d\n\nJ.P. Morgan\u2019s Lakos-Bujas, on the other hand, predicts that value stocks can make a comeback even without the help of the Fed. \u201cThe JPM business cycle indicator has flagged deteriorating conditions for the past 18 months, and is close to its last intra-cycle lows seen in the first quarter of 2016 that set off a large factor rotation,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWith renewed synchronized global monetary policy easing and stimulus underway, liquidity conditions have already started to improve . . . liquidity often leads growth by six months.\u201d\n\nWhat may be the worst case scenario for the nascent rotation is a global economy that continues to deteriorate, but avoids a recession and therefore doesn\u2019t invite much central bank stimulus. Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Wealth Management wrote in a Wednesday research note that he doesn\u2019t see much upside for interest rates going forward.\n\n\u201cGrowth is slowing and trade uncertainty is high,\u201d he wrote, adding that he expects U.S. economic growth to slow to 1.3% next year, avoiding a recession. \u201cAs a result, we anticipate bond yields will remain under pressure over the near term.\u201d\n\nHe advises investors instead to continue to invest in defensive stocks, like those in the consumer staples and utilities sectors, stocks which have shown solid momentum of late.", "description": "For a rotation into value stocks to continue interest rates will have to start rising, either due to a imminent rebound in global economic growth or...", "authors": ["Chris Matthews", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-FZ622_rotati_ZG_20171205134752.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
