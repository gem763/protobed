The office is a distribution center in the city of Jalalabad for national identity cards, which people need to vote in Afghanistan\u2019s presidential election in 10 days.\n\n\u201cAfghan security forces surrounded the building and are clashing with the attackers in a bid to counter the attack,\u201d said Sohrab Qaderi, a council member for the city\u2019s province of Nangarhar, adding that more casualties are feared with staff and other people stuck in the building.\n\nNo group has claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nMuch of Afghanistan is on high alert in the days approaching the election, the country\u2019s fourth presidential poll since United States-led forces toppled the hardline Islamist Taliban in 2001. The insurgents have sworn to violently disrupt the vote, which comes in the aftermath of collapsed peace talks between the militants and the United States.\n\nRoughly 9.6 million people, about a third of them women, have registered to vote, but roughly one in twelve polling centers may not open because of security threats.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, the Taliban warned teachers, students and other education workers to avoid the upcoming presidential vote or risk dying in attacks on election centers.\n\n\u201cDo not allow election organizers to turn your schools and institutions into electoral centers, and teachers and students should not work as electoral staff,\u201d said the Taliban statement.\n\n\u201cWe do not want to cause the loss of lives and financial losses for civilians, teachers and students,\u201d it said.\n\nSchools and universities make up between seven and eight out of every ten polling centers across the country, and though no students, teachers or education officials are being hired as election workers, they can volunteer, said Abdul Aziz Ibrahimi, a spokesman for Afghanistan\u2019s election commission.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to holding elections on the announced date, and such threats from the Taliban cannot prevent us from holding them,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\nA Ministry of Education spokeswoman, Nooria Nazhat, said they had not wanted to use schools and other education centers as polling stations but had been forced to, despite the destruction of schools in parliamentary elections last year.\n\nThe United Nations and international donors had asked the ministry to help with the presidential elections because of its relatively developed infrastructure.\n\nRelated Coverage Pakistan PM aims to restart Afghan peace talks\n\nOn Tuesday, Taliban attackers killed nearly 50 people in separate suicide bombings, one targeting an election rally for incumbent President Ashraf Ghani, who is seeking a second five-year term.\n\nLast week, peace talks between the United States and the Taliban collapsed. The two sides had been seeking to reach an accord on the withdrawal of thousands of American troops from Afghanistan in exchange for security guarantees from the insurgents.\n\nThe negotiations, which did not include the Afghan government, were intended as a prelude to wider peace negotiations to end more than more 40 years of war in Afghanistan.", "description": "A suicide bomber and gunmen wounded at least nine people, including a child and a woman, in an attack on a government building in eastern Afghan on Wednesday, officials said.", "authors": ["Ahmad Sultan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431177928&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H0OF", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
