(Image: Sony Pictures)\n\nThe first trailer for Bloodshot has arrived, and Vin Diesel (looking very Vin Diesel) is on a mission to avenge his lost love, aided only by his desire for payback... and one billion nanobots.\n\nSony\u2019s first Valiant Comics adaptation \u2014 after spending years trying to get a cinematic universe based off of the indie superhero comics universe off the ground \u2014 tells the story of a soldier named Ray Garrison (Diesel) brought back to life thanks to Rising Spirit Technologies (RST). Not only that, his blood was filled with nanobots that can repair his body and give him super-strength.\n\nGarrison uses his new superhuman abilities to go after the person who killed his partner \u2014 except he\u2019s doing it over and over and over again. It doesn\u2019t take long for the truth to come out: The corporation that rebuilt him is manipulating his memories to get him to kill people for them. Turn\u2019s out Garrison\u2019s not too pleased with that, and now RST has an unkillable and very angry Vin Diesel on its blood-stained hands!\n\nIn addition to Diesel, Bloodshot stars Guy Pearce, Toby Kebbel, Sam Heughan, Eliza Gonzalez, Talulah Riley, and others. The film is Dave Wilson\u2019s directorial debut, having previously worked as a creative supervisor on Avengers: Age of Ultron and designing video game trailers... including trailers for Bioware\u2019s sci-fi epic Mass Effect 2, which featured a similar \u201clet\u2019s put tiny bots inside to repair a person\u201d sequence and may explain why they look pretty familiar. Shame that Bloodshot is no Commander Shepard, though.\n\nBloodshot arrives in U.S. theatres on February 21, 2020. It does not have a current Australian release date.", "description": "The first trailer for Bloodshot\u00a0has arrived, and Vin Diesel (looking very Vin Diesel) is on a mission to avenge his lost love, aided only by his desire for payback... and one billion nanobots....", "authors": ["Cecilia D'Anastasio", "Alex Kidman"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/nxxq21kccdngnnop7ucc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
