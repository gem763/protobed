The coaches\u2019 enduring connection to Randwick was evident in their emotional responses to the passing of club legend and mentor Jeff Sayle last week, bringing tears to the eyes of two of hardest men in rugby.\n\nRugby World Cup: how the quarter-finalists shape up | Michael Aylwin Read more\n\nIt makes you wonder what would have become of Cheika and Jones if a club like Randwick did not exist.\n\nThe Sydney club scene was a snobbish place when Cheika and Jones grew up in the 1970s and 1980s. In pre-dominantly Anglo-Celtic Australia, the pair were outsiders, Cheika the son of Lebanese immigrants, Jones half-Japanese.\n\nRandwick was an egalitarian club where lawyers rubbed shoulders with labourers. Without this inclusive culture, Cheika and Jones may have found themselves playing rugby league, a game they both love and are still heavily influenced by.\n\nThere is a seven-year age difference between Cheika and Jones, but their careers overlapped. Cheika and Jones were good club players, very good. Pound for pound Jones, an 80kg hooker, was arguably the toughest player in the Sydney competition, while let\u2019s just say that Cheika, a big backrower, was uncompromising.\n\nJones had another weapon, his sharp tongue, which eviscerated victims. A lover of cricket, Jones could certainly sledge for the Australian XI.\n\nThe pair played for New South Wales, but neither played for the Wallabies, perhaps stoking the fires of their coaching ambitions. They are similar, but different, personalities. Jones coaches with mathematical precision, Cheika with passion and emotion.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Randwick played host to World Cup-bound Argentina at Coogee Oval in the build-up to the tournament in Japan.

In a sense Cheika and the Wallabies have never fully recovered from that whitewash. In subsequent years Jones coached England to another three wins against Cheika\u2019s Wallabies, establishing a psychological advantage over the men in gold.\n\nAnd now here they are pitted against each other again as the pair seek World Cup glory to crown their careers. They have both lost finals, Cheika in 2015 and Jones in 2003 as Wallabies coach, denied by a Jonny Wilkinson field goal in extra-time. This may be the last chance for both of them.\n\nIt would not be Cheika v Jones without a bit of pre-game chat to liven things up. When England\u2019s final pool game against France was cancelled due to Typhoon Hagibis, Jones claimed his team would benefit from the two-week break compared to the Wallabies\u2019 hard match with a physical Georgia. Cheika shot back saying England had the best preparation so they better win.\n\nMichael Cheika questions worth of Ricky Stuart working with England Read more\n\nCheika threw another barb at Jones when he described the presence of Canberra Raiders coach Ricky Stuart in the England camp as \u201cweird.\u201d But it is not just rivalry with Cheika that is motivating Jones. If England beat the Wallabies on Saturday, Jones will end Cheika\u2019s tenure as Australia coach.\n\nNo one would appreciate the irony more than Jones, who was sacked as Wallabies coach at the end of 2005 after losing eight of nine Tests that year. Jones cried bitter tears at a media conference following his sacking. It hurt him then and it would surprise if it still didn\u2019t. Time does not heal every wound.\n\nRugby Australia tore up a contract that would have taken Jones through to the 2007 World Cup in France, making him the longest-serving Wallaby coach. Instead, Jones acted as a consultant to the Springboks, who won the tournament, while the Wallabies were eliminated in the quarter-final by England.\n\nHoping history repeats itself, Jones now has an opportunity to exact the sweetest revenge on Rugby Australia by eliminating the Wallabies from this World Cup \u2013 and beating his old mate Cheika into the bargain.", "description": "Rugby siblings from the same nursery, the Australia and England coaches will renew their intense rivalry in the World Cup quarter-final", "authors": ["Bret Harris"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fedfcdd83b3bb5084c685870b6612011e508f6a/0_103_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f01bc6a9e972652c76b04b0459daa287", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
