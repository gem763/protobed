Her attorney said she had received a congressional subpoena and would \u201ccomply and answer questions\u201d from lawmakers. She resigned from the White House National Security Council over the summer.\n\nShe is the first White House official to appear as part of the House impeachment inquiry . Her appearance comes despite a White House vow to halt any and all cooperation with what it termed the \u201cillegitimate\u201d impeachment probe. The White House did not immediately respond to questions about whether they had sought to limit Hill\u2019s testimony.\n\nA former top aide to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has also been asked to appear for an interview this week, according to several officials familiar with the planning.\n\nMichael McKinley, a career foreign service officer and Pompeo\u2019s de facto chief of staff, resigned Friday, ending a 37-year career, as the impeachment probe turns its focus on the State Department in the Ukraine matter.\n\nThe sources were unauthorized to discuss the planning and granted anonymity\n\nHouse Democrats asked that McKinley appear for a closed-door interview Wednesday, the same day that George Kent, another State Department official, is also scheduled. It is unclear if they will appear.\n\nRepublicans called on Rep. Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, to release transcripts of the depositions to the public. The California Democrat said Sunday that having witnesses appear behind closed doors would prevent them from knowing what other witnesses said.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that we meet the needs of the investigation and not give the president or his legal minions the opportunity to tailor their testimony and in some cases fabricate testimony to suit their interests,\u201d Schiff said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the House oversight committee, said he learned Monday morning that Schiff had subpoenaed Hill.\n\n\u201cShe was going to come, she\u2019d agreed to come, she was going to come voluntarily but he\u2019s going to subpoena her, I believe, so he could ask certain questions and again keep those secret except for the certain things he wants to leak,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cThe tragedy here and the crime here is that the American people don\u2019t get to see what\u2019s going on in these sessions.\u201d\n\nThe subpoena was issued because of attempts by the Trump administration to direct witnesses not to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry and to limit the testimony of witnesses, an official working on the impeachment inquiry told The Associated Press. Hill complied with the subpoena and was answering questions from both Democrats and Republicans, the official said.\n\nThe official spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss details of the closed-door deposition.\n\nLater this week, U.S. ambassador Gordon Sondland, Trump\u2019s hand-picked ambassador to the European Union, is expected to appear for a deposition against the wishes of the White House, after being subpoenaed. He\u2019s expected to tell Congress that his text message reassuring another envoy that there was no quid pro quo in their interactions with Ukraine was based solely on what Trump told him, according to a person familiar with his coming testimony in the impeachment probe\n\nSondland\u2019s appearance, set for Thursday, comes after a cache of text messages from top envoys provided a vivid account of their work acting as intermediaries around the time Trump urged Ukraine\u2019s new president, Volodymr Zelenskiy, to start investigations into a company linked to the family of Democratic rival Joe Biden.\n\nOne witness who may not be called before Congress is the still-anonymous government whistleblower who touched off the impeachment inquiry.\n\nTop Democrats say testimony and evidence coming in from other witnesses, and even the Republican president himself, are backing up the whistleblower\u2019s account of what transpired during Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Zelenskiy. Lawmakers have grown deeply concerned about protecting the person from Trump\u2019s threats and may not wish to risk exposing the whistleblower\u2019s identity.\n\nSchiff said on Sunday that Democrats \u201cdon\u2019t need the whistleblower, who wasn\u2019t on the call, to tell us what took place on the call.\u201d\n\nSchiff said it \u201cmay not be necessary\u201d to reveal the whistleblower\u2019s identity as the House gathers evidence. \u201cOur primary interest right now is making sure that that person is protected,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Trump strongly objected.\n\n\u201cAdam Schiff now doesn\u2019t seem to want the Whistleblower to testify. NO!\u201d the Republican president tweeted early Monday. \u201cWe must determine the Whistleblower\u2019s identity to determine WHY this was done to the USA.\u201d\n\nThe impeachment inquiry is testing the Constitution\u2019s system of checks and balances as the House presses forward with the probe and the White House dismisses it as \u201cillegitimate\u201d because there has been no formal vote of the House to open impeachment proceedings.\n\nIn calling for a vote, the White House is trying to press House Democrats who may be politically reluctant to put their names formally behind impeachment.\n\nBut House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has resisted those efforts and is unlikely to budge as Congress returns this week. Democrats say Congress is well within its power as the legislative branch to conduct oversight of the president and it is Republicans, having grown weary of Trump\u2019s actions, who may be in the greater political bind over a vote.", "description": "Fiona Hill, a former top National Security Council expert on Russia, was testifying to Congress behind closed doors Monday, the latest former Trump...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT259_hill_f_ZG_20191014130320.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
