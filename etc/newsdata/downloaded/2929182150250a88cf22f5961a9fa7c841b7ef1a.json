Granted, many designers have been gravitating toward bright colors in general \u2014 yellows, oranges, greens \u2014 so it makes sense to round it out by talking about the electric blues of Milan Fashion Week.\n\nOr maybe they\u2019re royal blue. The models at Alberta Feretti certainly looked regal in long, graceful gowns. Or perhaps it\u2019s a more artistic shade of blue that\u2019s du jour. Moshchino\u2019s show was inspired by the works of Picasso, and there were several looks that included bright blue alongside rich yellows and funky accessories. Some of the other shades \u2013 like one dress at Marni \u2013 reminded us of the color the Virgin Mary often wears in Renaissance paintings. Very Milanese. Feeling blue? Us too.", "description": "Milan Fashion week showed many deep blue shades at its spring 2020 shows.
