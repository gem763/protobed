Lauer is shown at the Games\n\nShe claimed that Lauer - who was married at the time - pushed her onto a bed and had anal sex with her despite her telling him she did not want to after a night of drinking in Sochi.\n\nShe said they were in his hotel room and he was wearing boxers and a t-shirt.\n\nAmong other things, she said she 'wept silently into a pillow' while he had sex with her and that it 'hurt'.\n\nLauer hit back in a three-page, 1,400 word response on Wednesday, saying that while they did have anal sex, it was consensual.\n\nHe went into graphic detail about the Sochi incident and described others - including having sex in his Today dressing room - and called Nevils a 'willing partner'.\n\n'It is categorically false, ignores the facts, and defies common sense,' he said of the rape allegation.\n\n'I had an extramarital affair with Brooke Nevils in 2014. It began when she came to my hotel room very late one night in Sochi, Russia. We engaged in a variety of sexual acts. We performed oral sex on each other, we had vaginal sex, and we had anal sex.\n\n'Each act was mutual and completely consensual,' he said.", "description": "Brooke Nevils, the NBC producer who claimed Matt Lauer anally raped her in a hotel room during the 2014 Sochi Olympics, believed the attack was her fault.", "authors": ["Kayla Brantley For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/03/19568540-0-image-a-13_1570761526470.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
