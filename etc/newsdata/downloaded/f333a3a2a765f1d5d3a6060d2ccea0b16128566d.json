Luckily, the power continued to flow and so did Burton.\n\nOliver Sarkic gave Burton an unlikely lead with his 14th minute volley against Bournemouth\n\nThe former Leeds forward wheels away in celebration after opening the scoring for Burton\n\nAfter the resumption, Oliver Sarkic, the man who\u2019d opened the scoring on 15 minutes turned provider for Nathan Broadhead to net what was a thoroughly deserved second for the Brewers.\n\nWith Bournemouth currently a lofty sixth in the Premier league table - ahead of Manchester United, Chelsea and Tottenham - it came as little surprise that Eddie Howe made 10 changes to the team that claimed local bragging rights at Southampton last Friday.\n\nThere was a first competitive start for defender Simon Francis in nine months following his cruciate ligament injury and a Bournemouth debut for summer arrival Lloyd Kelly.\n\nBurton players congratulate the Montenegro international after his fine goal\n\nThe top-flight side started well enough, zipping passes around on the slick surface but Burton, who aren\u2019t exactly setting the world alight in League One, soon shook them from their comfort zone.\n\nRyan Edwards tested Bournemouth keeper Mark Travers with a low shot moments before the deadlock was broken on the quarter-hour.\n\nReece Hutchinson made headway into the Bournemouth box and crossed to Montenegro under-21 international Sarkic, who\u2019d ghosted in behind the Cherries\u2019 unfamiliar second string defence.\n\nBournemouth's Ryan Fraser rounded Burton keeper Kieran O'Hara but the keeper recovered\n\nThe game was disrupted twice as a power outage caused the stadium floodlights to turn off\n\nSarkic\u2019s connection on the volley was sweet and his shot found out the bottom corner for a memorable first goal in English football.\n\nBurton sought to press home their advantage and Travers had to fingertip away a Broadhead effort not long afterwards.\n\nHowe immediately switched his side to a 4-3-3 system after conceding but there was plenty that was shoddy and slapdash about Bournemouth\u2019s play as too many passes went astray - or simply out of play.\n\nThey struggled to get service into Jordon Ibe and Dominic Solanke up front, though Ibe thought he should have been awarded a penalty when tackled by John-Joe O\u2019Toole.\n\nThe players returned to the pitch and 28 minutes were added on at the Pirelli Stadium\n\nBut there were even louder appeals for handball at the other end when Jack Simpson slid in to challenge Broadhead, referee John Busby again unmoved.\n\nThose who\u2019d made the mammoth midweek journey from the south coast amused themselves by singing the Simpsons theme tune whenever Simpson touched the ball and there were certainly plenty of \u2018D\u2019oh\u2019 moments during a lacklustre first-half.\n\nYet they might have gone in level but for Burton keeper Kieran O\u2019Hara\u2019s bravery in saving at Ryan Fraser\u2019s feet after Solanke had slipped the Scotsman through.\n\nWhen play resumed, Broadhead could easily have settled it, only to be denied by Travers\u2019 fingertip save.\n\nEddie Howe fielded a relatively strong side but they looked out of sorts on Wednesday\n\nThe fourth official James Bell drew laughter from the crowd by announcing 28 minutes of \u201cadded time\u201d on his electronic board and in the eighth of those Burton doubled their lead.\n\nSarkic zipped into the Bournemouth box down the right and crossed low for Broadhead to finish at the back post.\n\nAnd it took another excellent Travers save to deny Sarkic his second moments later after Hutchinson had again worked space to cross.\n\nBournemouth struck the post late on through Simpson\u2019s header but a fightback always looked well beyond them.", "description": "Bournemouth were knocked out of the Carabao Cup by Burton.
