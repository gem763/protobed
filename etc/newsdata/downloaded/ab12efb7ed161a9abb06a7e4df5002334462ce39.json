Millions of dollars had been spent to build the 1,200-acre fairgrounds and its nearly 1,500 buildings\u2014a huge scale that ended up delaying the opening by a year. During the eight months the fair stayed open, nearly 20 million people paid a visit. On display were marvels of technology, agriculture, art, and history, and there were amusement rides and entertainment to be found in a section called \u201cthe Pike.\u201d The fair introduced a huge audience to some relatively new inventions such as private automobiles, outdoor electric lighting, and the X-ray machine\u2014as well as foods from across the United States and around the world. The exposition also had a focus on anthropological exhibits\u2014with an approach that is shocking by today\u2019s standards: In some cases, organizers brought people from the Philippines, the Arctic, and elsewhere to the fairgrounds as set pieces among re-creations of their home environment or villages. After the fair closed, nearly all of its structures were demolished within a short time, leaving only a few footprints, ponds, and canals in Forest Park in St. Louis.", "description": "In April 1904, St. Louis opened its doors to the world, welcoming millions to see the fascinating buildings and exhibits of art, technology, and history on display at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition.", "authors": ["Alan Taylor"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/photo/2019/09/1904-fair/w01_SIA-NHB-16424-1/facebook.jpg?1568050457", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
