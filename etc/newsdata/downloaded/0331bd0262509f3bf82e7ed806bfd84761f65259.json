They include Da Vinci masterpieces, dozens of studies and scientific sketches, and pieces by other artists in Da Vinci\u2019s orbit. Visitors can also experience a virtual reality portion of the exhibit that delves into the story behind the \u201cMona Lisa.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe wished, in order to pay homage to the artist, to be able to show the entirety of Leonardo Da Vinci\u2019s career and his development and to explain, ultimately, the sense of his life,\u201d curator Vincent Delieuvin told The Associated Press.\n\nThe exhibit runs through Feb. 24, 2020. Visitors must reserve tickets online in advance, and the Louvre said it has already pre-sold 220,000 tickets as of Monday morning.\n\nMore than 10 years in the making, the project began when Louis Frank, the exhibit\u2019s other curator, translated a Renaissance-era Da Vinci biography to round out existing knowledge about the painter\u2019s life. That biographical emphasis is evident in the exhibit\u2019s design, which traces the artist\u2019s trajectory from his apprenticeship with Florentine sculptor Andrea del Verocchio to his death in France in 1519.\n\nWith a whole room devoted to his scientific pursuits, it seeks to capture the quest for knowledge and perfection of a man Delieuvin called \u201ca universal genius.\u201d\n\n\u201cLeonardo Da Vinci, he is one of those rare men, those personalities who fascinate us, because he was universal,\u201d Delieuvin said. \u201cHe had an interest in all aspects of nature, we all see ourselves in his personality.\u201d\n\n\u201cMathematicians, geometry specialists, doctors, artists, everyone sees a part of themselves in Leonardo,\u201d he added.\n\nSeveral of Da Vinci\u2019s completed paintings will be on display, including \u201cLa Belle Ferronniere\u201d and \u201cThe Virgin and Child with Saint Anne.\u201d The \u201cMona Lisa\u201d will remain in its case, upstairs. Visitors will be able to see \u201cPortrait of a Musician\u201d on loan from the Vatican and \u201cBenois Madonna\u201d from St. Petersburg, among other works the Louvre borrowed for the occasion.\n\nSome pieces proved more difficult to obtain. The \u201cVitruvian Man,\u201d Da Vinci\u2019s famous drawing of the ideally proportioned male figure, arrived in France from Venice\u2019s Accademia Gallery only days before the exhibit\u2019s opening.\n\nItalian heritage group Our Italy tried to block the loan, saying the drawing was too fragile to be moved. An Italian court originally suspended the loan before ruling last week that it could travel to France for eight weeks. In exchange, the Louvre will lend several works by Raphael to Rome next year.\n\nThe dispute fanned the flames of a broader debate about Da Vinci\u2019s legacy and Italian national identity.\n\n\u201cA Leonardo Da Vinci exhibit is very difficult to do, since Da Vinci has become a symbol,\u201d Delieuvin said, calling it \u201cnatural\u201d that some museums are reluctant to lend pieces from their collections.\n\nThough Da Vinci died in France, Delieuvin said Louvre officials recognize and celebrate the painter\u2019s Italian roots.\n\n\u201cI assure everyone that the French have never appropriated Leonardo Da Vinci,\u201d he said. \u201cLeonardo is a genius who is evidently Italian, he was entirely formed in Italy, and he would not have become Leonardo Da Vinci in France.\u201d\n\nAnother, still-absent piece has also drawn significant attention. The Louvre put out a call for the \u201cSalvator Mundi\u201d but has yet to receive the painting, which sold to an anonymous buyer for a record-breaking $450 million in 2017.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear where the painting is, but speculation abounds that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman is its new owner. Art experts, meanwhile, remain divided over whether Da Vinci in fact painted the work.\n\nFor now, a variation of \u201cSalvator Mundi\u201d created in Da Vinci\u2019s studio hangs in the Louvre exhibit. Delieuvin said he does not know who owns the original, but he\u2019s holding out hope it will be sent over.\n\nDelieuvin has said the Louvre will withhold judgment on its provenance until they have the painting in hand.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Much about Leonardo Da Vinci remains an enigma: the smile of the \"Mona Lisa\"; why the world's most famous painter left so many works unfinished; and more recently, who bought the contentious \"Salvator Mundi.\"", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Claire Parker"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/22/france_da_vinci_exhibition_77147_c0-222-5347-3341_s1200x700.jpg?44502ce091e2dc508988d850c42bdfb15cc06634", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
