He also said it was a \"difficult issue\" and that government has already \"done our best to try to satisfy that group\".\n\nMr Johnson's non-committal remarks could provoke claims he is going back on his word from vocal campaign groups such as WASPI and Back to 60.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nIt comes after years of battles for around 3.8million women born in the 1950s, who are having their state pension age hiked to reach 66 by 2020.\n\nMinisters say the change is to make women's retirement age equal to men's - and would cost \u00a3181bn to fully reverse.\n\nWomen argued the change was unlawful age and sex discrimination and came with too little notice, but their claims were rejected in court.\n\nAsked how he'd help the women today, Mr Johnson told Labour MP Ronnie Campbell: \"As he knows it is a very difficult issue and I know very highly emotionally charged.\n\n\"We have done our best to try to satisfy that group. and another billion pounds has I think been allocated to the support of WASPI pensioners.\n\n\"But I would just remind MPs opposite who are chuntering at me, under the Labour Party I seem to remember female pensions went up by 75p. That was their approach to pensions rights for women.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"We are indeed looking at what more we can do to satisfy that issue but it is as he knows a very difficult issue.\"\n\nThe comments are far less uplifting than what Mr Johnson said in July when he ran for Tory leader.\n\nBack then he said: \u201cI have made several representations already on behalf of my own constituents who fall into this category.\n\n\u201cAnd I must say the answer I\u2019ve got back from the Treasury is not yet satisfactory.\n\n\u201cBut I will undertake - if I\u2019m lucky enough to succeed in this campaign - to return to this issue with fresh vigour and new eyes and see what I can do to sort it out.\n\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m conscious it\u2019s been going on for too long.\"\n\nAsked if he would \"commit\" to sorting it out, he said in July: \u201cI commit to doing everything I possibly can to sorting it out.\n\n\u201cBut you know obviously the Treasury raise some stupefying sum that they say will be necessary to deal with it. I\u2019m not convinced that\u2019s necessarily true. Let\u2019s see what we can do.\u201d\n\nA hike to women's state pension age from 60 to 65, over 10 years starting in 2010, was first proposed in the 1995 Pensions Act.\n\nBut that was accelerated by the 2011 Pensions Act, which laid out plans to hike the age to 65 in November 2018 - followed by 66 in October 2020.\n\nFacing an outcry, ministers agreed a \u00a31.1bn concession in the final stages of the Act, supposedly to limit any one person's pension age rise to 18 months.\n\nBut the women's lawyer Michael Mansfield QC said: \"They have pushed women who were already disadvantaged into the lowest class you can imagine. They're on the brink of survival.\"\n\nThe judicial review was brought by the group Back to 60, which says women had a \"legitimate expectation\" to receive their pension aged 60 and demands \"the return of those earned dues\".\n\nSeparately, Women Against State Pension Inequality (WASPI) is calling for \"fair transitional arrangements\" to help women financially, but not a full return to age 60.", "description": "The Prime Minister gave vague promises more than three months after pledging to do \"everything I possibly can\"", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20393876.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_State-pension-age-legal-case.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
