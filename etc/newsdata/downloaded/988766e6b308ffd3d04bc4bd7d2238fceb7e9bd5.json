The Spy is based on a book about Eli Cohen\u2019s work for the Mossad in the 1960s, when he helped infiltrate the Syrian Ministry of Defense before eventually being executed. Fast-paced and gritty, the series paints a fresh and engrossing portrait of the Israeli operative, even though his fate is made clear from the start.\n\nThe reason the show really works, though, is because it isn\u2019t straight history; Eli Cohen\u2019s own daughter has pointed out the factual inaccuracies littered throughout the six episodes. Of course, this is how spy stories have always worked. The subject matter itself involves a world of lies and deceit; it\u2019s no surprise that the writers depicting it tend to stretch the truth and at times outright make things up.\n\nNobody believes there was somebody working for the MI6 that lived the way James Bond did. Sure, there was probably some suave secret agent somewhere who liked his martinis shaken, not stirred, but Bond is an object of pure fantasy. And that\u2019s fine. From Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s take on the genre to Jason Bourne, the spy story works because of fiction, not fact. The minutiae of gathering intelligence really doesn\u2019t make for a compelling story; blowing stuff up and saving the world while wearing a tuxedo, now that\u2019s a cool story.\n\nBut John le Carr\u00e9 has never dealt in that sort of spy story. That\u2019s probably why he\u2019s had so much sustained success since the early-1960s. The man born David Cornwell is a living expert on the art of real espionage, having served for both the Security Service (MI5) and the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) before he found fame writing novels. And at the spry age of 88, he just delivered his latest: Agent Running in the Field.\n\nWhile le Carr\u00e9 made his name as a writer just as the world was really starting to embrace the spy as a heroic figure, his characters have always been anything but. Instead, le Carr\u00e9\u2019s talent lies in profiling broken people, using the Kafkan trick of showing how a system can break good people while never venturing into the Kafkaesque. That is, there\u2019s hardly a hint of fabulism or fantasy in his books, and there\u2019s not much sexiness, either. John le Carr\u00e9 deals in a brand an espionage v\u00e9rit\u00e9, humanizing people who collect secrets in the name of their government or, in some cases, their own interests.\n\nYet his latest book comes at a somewhat precarious time in Western history. Almost on a daily basis there\u2019s some new article looking at Donald Trump\u2019s ongoing issues with the intelligence community. At the very heart of the ongoing impeachment inquiry is an unnamed CIA officer.\n\nIt could be said that fictional spies, as well as real-life ones, are in an odd position in 2019. They\u2019re tasked with protecting their country, but are caught in the middle of an ongoing culture war. Are they good guys or not? That vague question helps make so many of le Carr\u00e9 books interesting, but he is more concerned with if they\u2019re good people, and how they react to the crushing world in which they operate.\n\nThat\u2019s what makes Agent Running in the Field such an engaging read, and one that I don\u2019t think fans of Trump or supporters of Brexit will necessarily like. Le Carr\u00e9, who has been critical of the American president as well as his own country\u2019s plan to withdraw from the European Union, has found a way to channel his own frustrations into his latest book. The result is a new avenue for the spy novel: a means for exploring political consciousness. It\u2019s not something totally new to his work, but whereas his other books may look at the psychological toll the intelligence world has on individuals, Agent Running in the Field is a distinctly political novel.\n\nBut the politics Le Carr\u00e9 focuses on aren\u2019t necessarily about spies working to stop some secret terrorist cell from striking, or any other classic East vs. West plot. Instead, it\u2019s a middle finger to the things the 88-year-old personally finds wrong with the world, told via the actions of a group of misfit and/or over-the-hill agents. And the enemies they are trained on, more or less, are Trump and Brexit. The characters serve as a filter for the author\u2019s not-at-all-veiled beliefs.\n\nAnd he unloads \u2014 a lot. Mostly through Nat, the main character, and one of his colleagues, Ed. One of their first meetings turns into a discussion about Trump: \u201cBritain\u2019s departure from the European Union in the time of Donald Trump, and Britain\u2019s consequent unqualified dependence on the United States in an era when the US is heading straight down the road to institutional racism and neo-fascism,\u201d Ed tells Nat, \u201cis an unmitigated clusterfuck.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s really just the beginning. While there is plenty of action in the book \u2014 though, to be fair, hardly enough for people that crave the sort of action you might get in a Bond or Bourne film \u2014 what Agent Running in the Field gives us, instead, is something real. It shows that people have their allegiances and their biases even if they\u2019re tasked with working for a government they might not totally support. I\u2019d say it\u2019s nuanced in that sense, but the way Le Carr\u00e9 frames it sometimes makes Ed\u2019s rants about Trump and Brexit sound more like little manifestos hidden inside a spy novel.\n\nAnd maybe that is the future of the genre as a whole. Sure, there will always be room for the mass-market paperbacks from the Tom Clancy School of Mega Bestsellers, but as le Carr\u00e9 has shown (and continues to, even as he approaches his nineties), there\u2019s so much more that the spy novel can accomplish, especially as institutions continue on whatever wayward trajectory they\u2019re currently abiding. Embellishment and fantasy might be more fun, but something true \u2014 or at least as close to the truth as one can get when writing about people who trade on secrets and lies for a living \u2014 is a better direction forward for the genre, and a nobler cause for the authors who traffic in it. That\u2019s always been le Carr\u00e9\u2019s thing, but maybe now more than ever it feels downright necessary.", "description": "Although nobody needs even more TV recommendations, one of the true bright spots this year has been watching Sacha Baron Cohen\u2019s transition from Borat to", "authors": ["Jason Diamond"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-992520324.jpg?fit=1093%2C800", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
