One consists of 629 separate defense purchase orders for fuel at Prestwick totaling $11 million since October 2017. The other involves press reports that the airport has offered cut-rate rooms for select passengers and crew, and free rounds of golf at Turnberry to visiting U.S. military and civilian air crews.\n\nPentagon officials had no immediate comment.\n\n\u201cGiven the president\u2019s continued financial stake in his Scotland golf courses, these reports raise questions about the president\u2019s potential receipt of U.S. or foreign government emoluments, in violation of the U.S. Constitution, and raise other serious conflict of interest concerns,\u201d Cummings and Raskin said in the June 21 letter, which was reviewed by Reuters.\n\nThe Constitution bars government officials including the president from receiving financial benefits known as emoluments from foreign or domestic governments, without approval from Congress.\n\nDemocrats complained that the Pentagon\u2019s cooperation in their inquiry has been poor, and that it has not produced a single document in the investigation.\n\n\u201cThe committee will be forced to consider alternative steps if the Pentagon does not begin complying voluntarily in the coming days,\u201d a senior Democratic committee aide told Reuters in a statement.\n\nThe Trump Turnberry golf resort has also received government funding from the U.S. State Department.\n\nThe State Department paid SLC Turnberry Ltd, the Trump company that owns the resort, more than $77,000 ahead of a 2018 visit by Trump that occurred between a meeting with the NATO military alliance and a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nTrump resigned as director of Turnberry when he took office in January 2017 but continues to hold an ownership stake.", "description": "A powerful House of Representatives panel could soon step up pressure on the Pentagon for documents about an airport near a Trump-owned golf course in Scotland that has benefited from U.S. military purchases since President Donald Trump took office, an aide said on Saturday.", "authors": ["David Morgan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
