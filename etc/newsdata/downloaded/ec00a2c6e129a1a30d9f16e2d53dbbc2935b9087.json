Many of those who disagree are younger members of the party, who grew up knowing only Mugabe as national leader, and lost relatives to his decades of slaughter.\n\nMugabe ruled Zimbabwe for 37 years before his own Zanu-PF party ousted him in a coup in 2017. He died in Singapore, where he had spent months receiving treatment for liver issues. He was 95 years old, and 93 when he left power.\n\nThe most prodigious human rights atrocity during his rule was \u201cOperation Gukurahundi,\u201d the genocide of an estimated 20,000 people of the Ndebele indigenous group between 1983 and 1987 by elite, North Korea-trained forces loyal to Mugabe. The Ndebele largely rejected Mugabe and his Shona people as rulers. In the decades following Gukurahundi, Mugabe is believed to have killed thousands of dissidents in \u201croad accidents, poison and at times burning them in huts as he sought to retain power by hook or crook,\u201d as New Zimbabwe described it.\n\n\u201cWe are not happy at all. This is a man who killed our members for fun during his days in power. We cannot pretend that he is a saint today,\u201d an unnamed \u201cyouth\u201d told the newspaper. \u201cThat African culture dictates that we sanctify the departed is not applicable here. Chamisa, [MDC deputy leader Tendai] Biti and all other party leaders should just have kept their mouths shut.\u201d\n\nChamisa and Biti outraged the members of their party by expressing condolences to the Mugabe family and praising the late tyrant. Chamisa had also noted that, because of the coup against him. Mugabe had become an opposition supporter late in life.\n\n\u201cWhat is gratifying to us is that at the end of his reign he voted for change, he voted for me, in fact, Mr Mugabe is one of the few people who did not hide their vote,\u201d Chamisa told Al Jazeera. \u201cWe have lost a voter, we have lost a supporter, we have lost a citizen, an African son.\u201d\n\nBiti, meanwhile, told opponents of Mugabe, \u201cHis legacy shouldn\u2019t be detracted by the fact that there were atrocities.\u201d\n\nBiti himself has said he was \u201ctortured\u201d by Mugabe\u2019s thug forces for being a member of the opposition.\n\n\u201cThis is not funny at all. Mugabe killed many of our colleagues and never got to account for it. What is it our leaders got from Mugabe that they see him as a hero today?\u201d another anonymous MDC member told Zimbabwe Voice, and online outlet. Yet another opposition supporter speaking to the outlet said they were \u201cshocked but not surprised\u201d at Chamisa, calling the opposition \u201cvery weak.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are going nowhere with these clueless opposition leaders,\u201d the unnamed individual lamented.\n\nPride Mkono, who went on the record as a youth leader for the opposition, said it was \u201cshocking\u201d that Chamisa and the MDC leadership were not attacking Mugabe because he had recently died.\n\n\u201cThose that are celebrating Mugabe\u2019s violent legacy are either nonsensical, naive or both,\u201d said Mkono. \u201cIt is especially shocking coming from purported leaders of the opposition.\u201d\n\nMugabe\u2019s funeral arrangements have become a matter of controversy as his body makes its way back from Zimbabwe. Local outlets reported this week that there was some discord between the government of Zimbabwe, who wished to bury him with other communist leaders in Harare, and family members who sought the full funeral rites of a Shona chief that they believed Mugabe deserved.\n\nA spokesman for the family, nephew Leo Mugabe, told reporters that there was no disagreement between Harare and the Mugabe family.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no feud between the family and government. As to where he will be buried is dependent on the family, the family and chiefs in Zvimba are the people that will determine basically where he\u2019s going to be buried,\u201d Leo Mugabe said. \u201cTo say there\u2019s [a] feud is not correct, not true. We\u2019ve been meeting with government and everything has been very smooth, there\u2019s understanding, there\u2019s clarity on responsibilities and therefore, there is no feud whatsoever.\u201d\n\nThe government is holding a public viewing of the body on Thursday at Rufaro Stadium in Mbare, then a funeral in Harare on Saturday before the final burial. Those organizing the rites have not made public yet where Mugabe\u2019s final resting place will be.\n\nLeo Mugabe told reporters that the final resting place is a decision that Shona chiefs must make.\n\n\u201cThe chiefs in Zvimba still regard him as a chief and in terms of tradition, they are the ones that determine where is he going to be buried, how is he going to be buried, the procedures that must be followed in his burial,\u201d Mugabe said. \u201cThis is a cultural thing and nobody can push the chiefs to divulge where they are going to bury [Mugabe].\u201d\n\nLeaders of several African allies, including Nigeria and South Africa, are expected to attend Mugabe\u2019s official funeral. President Mnangagwa, who organized the coup against Mugabe after his wife Grace Mugabe forced him into exile, had kind words for the dictator upon his death on Friday, calling him \u201can icon of liberation.\u201d\n\nMnangagwa and the nation\u2019s military did not interrupt the thousands-strong protests against Mugabe in 2017 that called for him to be removed. Instead, Zanu-PF leaders claimed to listen to the people and begin impeachment proceedings in the legislature, which never came to fruition because Mugabe resigned.\n\nMnangagwa has since established a national holiday to celebrate the man he forced out of office.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "Members of Zimbabwe's opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) party are planning to protest late dictator Robert Mugabe's funeral.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/Mugabe-death-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
