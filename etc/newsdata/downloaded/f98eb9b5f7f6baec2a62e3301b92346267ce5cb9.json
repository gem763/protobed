The album is a project of meticulous curation and a map of the artist\u2019s geographic ties; it\u2019s also a direct challenge to what some audiences might expect of a young black musician raised in Atlanta. Referencing the sometimes troubling impulse of American artists to cherry-pick or fetishize cultural products from Asian countries, he continued: \u201cI did want to bring a level of respect to what I was doing and not have it just be like, Oh yeah, I\u2019m into anime.\u201d As he worked on HAN, a simple guiding question emerged: \u201cHow can I be as honest as possible?\u201d\n\nThe result is a record that manages to be eclectic yet cohesive. One way Berhana achieves this effect is by strategically pulling in musical references that are themselves references to previous works. For example, among the key inspirations for the album\u2019s soul- and funk-inflected songs\u2014including tracks such as \u201cGolden\u201d\u2014was Neuromantic, a 1981 album by the Japanese artist Yukihiro Takahashi. Going a step further, the Japanese soul and funk musicians of Takahashi\u2019s era were, for their part, drawing from the ideas and cultural cachet of black artists in America.\n\nMuch of HAN was recorded in Japan, between Kumejima, a small island in Okinawa, and Tokyo. In a nod to his international journey, Berhana threads together the album with short interludes that take the form of in-flight announcements. The singer wrote these segues to serve as narrative guides for the listener and to collate the album\u2019s disparate genres. How can I make all of these different sounds feel in the same world? he asked himself. HAN bounces through funk, soul, jazz, rock, and pop elements with little regard for the distinctions between those categories. Berhana resists placing himself within one genre, all too aware that singers like him are often relegated to the rap and R&B genres\u2014or, worse yet, that nebulous arena of \u201curban contemporary.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s called my music either rap or R&B, and I get it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a black guy making music, so that\u2019s just what you wanna say, and I\u2019ve seen it happen to artists forever.\u201d He mentioned Prince, who was often described as an R&B artist rather than, say, a rock star. But young black musicians today are stretching the boundaries of their assigned labels, and Berhana is hoping to do the same. Noting that he\u2019s always been drawn to experimental artists such as David Bowie, Bj\u00f6rk, Andr\u00e9 3000, and Squarepusher, he explained: \u201cI wanna make music that people like; I just don\u2019t wanna make music people expect.\u201d\n\nThis desire to grow and to surprise listeners intensified in the three years since the release of Berhana. \u201cJanet\u201d attracted attention\u2014and an enthusiastic fan base\u2014as a single, but the thrill of making the EP prompted Berhana to move to Los Angeles to pursue a music career in earnest. He worked at another restaurant there, but after repeatedly seeing artists he wanted to collaborate with walk in to eat, he resolved to quit. The month he left, he was able to just eke out a living; not long afterward, his song \u201cGrey Luh\u201d was featured on an episode of Donald Glover\u2019s FX show, Atlanta, and won him more recognition. Berhana\u2019s community back home (even the more skeptical family members) rallied around him. Things were falling into place.", "description": "Berhana, the Atlanta musician behind 2016\u2019s \u201cJanet,\u201d talks about incorporating diverse geographic influences in his debut album, HAN.", "authors": ["Hannah Giorgis"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/BERHANA_40/facebook.jpg?1571350028", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
