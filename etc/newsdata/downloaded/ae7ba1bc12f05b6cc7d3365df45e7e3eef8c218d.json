We will take a comprehensive look to uncover these core recommendations, factoring respective salaries into the analysis.\n\nPlease note, these player picks were organized early in the day. For MLB contests, always check lineups and weather closer to game time. Rain, wind, or unexpected managerial decisions could open up additional sources of value. Be sure to keep an eye on the MLB Headlines and Injuries desk.\n\nLet\u2019s take a peek at a two-game AL Division Series contest.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nPITCHER\n\nGerrit Cole \u2013 Houston Astros (vs Rays)\n\nDespite this being a postseason series, there\u2019s only one bonafide ace on the docket. Cole costs a boatload more than the other available arms, and he\u2019s the only one who\u2019s likely to pick up his team and carry them into the late innings. It should surprise nobody if all three of the other starters are relieved by the end of the fifth inning. Not only does Cole offer the best shot at a long outing, he\u2019s also a safe bet to post the best strikeout rate. While it\u2019s tempting to go contrarian in GPPs due to the small slate, skipping Cole is a mistake.\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling very cheeky in a multi-entry GPP, consider tossing in a lineup with Ryan Yarbrough. He\u2019s unlikely to pitch today, but there is a scenario where he provides some bulk innings following a short Snell outing.\n\nAlso Consider: Masahiro Tanaka, Blake Snell, Randy Dobnak\n\nCATCHER / FIRST BASE\n\nMitch Garver \u2013 Minnesota Twins (at Masahiro Tanaka)\n\nStory continues\n\nA visit to Yankees Stadium is always a good thing for power hitters. Garver and the Twins will aim to punish Tanaka before the Yankees elite bullpen can be brought to bear. Garver carries at least a one-in-four chance to homer. He\u2019s also my pick for likeliest to hit multiple home runs. His swing is geared to punish the sorts of hanging splitters that plague Tanaka in his worst outings. While Garver is the only Twin I highlight in this column, an entire Minnesota stack is a defensible choice \u2013 and a good way to save some cash.\n\nAlso Consider: Gary Sanchez, Travis d\u2019Arnaud, Edwin Encarnacion, Yuli Gurriel, Ji-Man Choi, Robinson Chirinos\n\nSECOND BASE\n\nGleyber Torres \u2013 New York Yankees (vs Randy Dobnak)\n\nOf course, the Yankees stack is the most obvious choice on account of their opponent. Dobnak performed well across nine appearances (five starts). He posted a 1.59 ERA with 7.31 K/9 and 1.59 BB/9. Interestingly, he has a high whiff rate despite the tepid strikeout rate \u2013 a sign he intentionally pitches to weak contact with his sinking fastball. If he qualified, Dobnak\u2019s 20.7 percent soft contact rate would rank sixth-best \u2013 smack between Clayton Kershaw and Stephen Strasburg. However, we\u2019re looking at a miniscule sample so we shouldn\u2019t overreact.\n\nIn many ways, Dobnak is like A\u2019s Wild Card starter Sean Manaea. The results to date have been excellent, but nobody thinks he\u2019s some kind of true talent 1.59 ERA ace. In this particular matchup against a fearsome lineup at a bandbox ballpark, he projects for an over-4.00 ERA. Torres is one of the top five hitters in the slate, and he can be had at an affordable price. He has a one-in-four chance to homer. Run production also figures to be a strength. His slight tendency towards fly balls should help him against a ground ball pitcher like Dobnak.\n\nAlso Consider: Jose Altuve, DJ LeMahieu, Brandon Lowe, Luis Arraez\n\nTHIRD BASE\n\nDJ LeMahieu \u2013 New York Yankees (vs Randy Dobnak)\n\nYou can use LeMahieu with Torres or as an alternative. However, the matchup isn\u2019t quite as sharp since both pitcher and hitter are ground ball guys. LeMahieu is likely to burn a couple worms versus Dobnak. This being a tiny slate, we have to look beyond the starting pitchers. The Twins bullpen features quite a few fly ball pitchers \u2013 basically everybody except Brusdar Graterol and Taylor Rogers. If the Yankees can quickly chase Dobnak, their leadoff hitter will suddenly look like a top producer. Since LeMahieu\u2019s best scenarios depend on Yankee success, you should probably plan to stack him.\n\nAlso Consider: Alex Bregman, Miguel Sano, Yuli Gurriel, Marwin Gonzalez, Gio Urshela, Yandy Diaz\n\nSHORTSTOP\n\nAlex Bregman \u2013 Houston Astros (vs Blake Snell)\n\nThe playoffs force unusual decisions such as picking upon Snell. The Rays ace missed most of the season\u2019s second half. He topped out at just 2.1 innings in his final start. Snell himself is targeting a five-inning appearance today, but there\u2019s a chance it\u2019ll be much shorter. The Rays bullpen is up to the task of carrying the team through six or seven frames. Bregman annihilated left-handed pitchers in a small sample this season. He also has strong career numbers. More to the point, he\u2019s simply one of the best pure hitters in the league. He projects to perform well against virtually any pitcher.\n\nAlso Consider: Torres, Jorge Polanco, Carlos Correa, Didi Gregorius, Willy Adames\n\nOUTFIELD\n\nMichael Brantley \u2013 Houston Astros (vs Blake Snell)\n\nIf you\u2019re playing a GPP, you\u2019ll need some sort of cost-saving contrarian play. Brantley could be your guy. With a lefty-on-lefty matchup, his ownership rate should be low. However, he\u2019s still a league average hitter against southpaws. Snell isn\u2019t much tougher on lefties than righties. As we just discussed, he hasn\u2019t lasted more than 2.1 innings since returning from the injured list, and he\u2019s hasn\u2019t looked especially sharp. The Rays bullpen is no picnic, but Brantley matches up reasonably well against the collection.\n\nGiancarlo Stanton \u2013 New York Yankees (vs Randy Dobnak)\n\nStanton is known for punishing pitches low in the strike zone. He should have little issue with turning on Dobnak\u2019s 93 mph sinker. Stanton\u2019s plate coverage is such that even the low-and-away corner can be pulled out of the park (or tapped lightly to the third baseman). The biggest uncertainty is if Stanton can lift Dobnak\u2019s bowling ball heater. After all, Stanton does hit more grounders than flies. As with LeMahieu, this matchup levels up if the Yankees can quickly crack into the Minnesota bullpen.\n\nAlso Consider: Nelson Cruz, Aaron Judge, Eddie Rosario, Austin Meadows, Max Kepler, Yordan Alvarez, George Springer, Brett Gardner, Tommy Pham, Marwin Gonzalez, Jake Cave", "description": "Brad Johnson finds the best MLB DFS Plays for Saturday, October 5.
