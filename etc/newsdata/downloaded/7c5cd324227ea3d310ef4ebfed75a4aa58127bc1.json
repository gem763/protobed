The ministry will likely be different than what we saw with Adel al-Jubeir and Ibrahim al-Assaf.\"\n\nShe told AFP on Wednesday that Farhan \"has really strong ties with traditional Saudi allies, US and even a more European outlook than would be traditionally the case\".\n\nElana DeLozier, a research fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, told AFP it was still not immediately clear why the replacements took place.\n\n\"Al-Jubeir, the foreign minister previously, is still rather present in the foreign policy scene,\" she said.\n\n\"In fact, he has remained more prominent in the media than Assaf.\"\n\n-Regional tensions -\n\nSaudi King Salman also replaced the transport minister, Nabil al-Amoudi, with Saleh bin Nasser Al-Jasser on Wednesday.\n\nThis comes after 35 foreigner were killed when a bus collided with another heavy vehicle near the Islamic holy city of Medina last week.\n\nTransporting worshippers around the holy sites, particularly during the hajj, is a huge challenge for Saudi Arabia.\n\nDuring the pilgrimage, the roads can be chaotic with thousands of buses creating interminable traffic jams.\n\nThe kingdom has also been navigating a spike in tensions with its regional arch-rival Iran, with attacks on Saudi oil facilities last month that temporarily halved the kingdom's crude output and sent prices soaring.\n\nYemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels claimed responsibility, but US officials blamed Tehran, charging that the rebels did not have the range or sophistication to target the facilities.\n\nTehran has denied involvement and warned of \"total war\" in the event of any attack on its territory.\n\nEarlier this month, an Iranian tanker was hit in suspected missile strikes off the coast of Saudi Arabia, sparking new fears of war.", "description": "Saudi Arabia's King Salman appointed a new foreign minister on Wednesday, according to a royal decree issued less than a year after his predecessor took office.
