Her friends warned her she could be a sex addict. At age 21, she was a victim of revenge porn, which her therapist considered evidence that her friends\u2019 sex addiction theory had merit. \u201cI thought it was all my fault,\u201d she said. \u201cThat's when I surrendered and accepted the \u2018diagnosis\u2019 of sex and love addict.\u201d\n\nFor four years, Taylor attended volunteer-run Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous (SLAA) meetings, which follow the 12-step model of Alcoholics Anonymous. Members suggested she had repressed childhood sexual trauma and urged her to be celibate for a year. Once she\u2019d made it nine months, she followed the other women in the group's example and committed to only having sex within monogamous relationships. Whenever she felt desire, she said, \"I berated myself and dragged myself to a meeting in fear of falling back into \u2018old habits.' I felt like a zombie.\" Over time, Taylor wondered why she was being encouraged to think of sex like a disease. At meetings, she asked, \u201cWho decides how much sex is too much? How do we know if we're addicts?\"\n\nAfter receiving unsatisfying responses, Taylor saw a sex therapist. \"Is it possible that you're not a sex addict, and maybe you're just a woman who enjoys sex in a society that shames women for enjoying sex?\u201d he asked. She cried with relief on his couch.\n\nSex addiction has never been a formal diagnosis. Though treatment centers and books like Patrick Carnes\u2019s 1983 Out of the Shadows: Understanding Sexual Addiction have popularized the term, the mental health field is increasingly critical of it, based on research suggesting that sex does not affect the brain like an addictive substance. A 2016 study by sex researcher Nicole Prause in PLOS One, for example, found that people who engaged in risky sexual behaviors were more sensitive to genital stimulation, not desensitized, as the sex \"addiction\" model would predict.\n\nThe American Psychological Association repeatedly rejects proposals to add sex addiction or \u201chypersexual disorder\u201d to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. In the 2018 edition of the International Classification of Diseases, the World Health Organization also rejected the label of sex addiction and instead included \"compulsive sexual behavior disorder.\" Many psychologists favor the latter label because it describes a behavioral pattern, not an addiction, and focuses on treating the underlying issues rather than directly changing sexual behavior itself.\n\nBefore he was trained as a sex therapist, psychotherapist Joe Kort adopted a sex addiction treatment model due to sex-negative cultural messages he\u2019d received earlier in his life and career. But as he saw this approach repeatedly fail, he abandoned it. \u201cThe training is loaded with addiction and trauma information and education, but not sexuality,\u201d he said. Kort feels the term is over-applied to people simply because they enjoy sex without emotional attachment. \u201cThe sex addiction therapist misunderstands sexual health and imposes their own bias and moral beliefs onto what could be completely natural for the client,\u201d he said.\n\nLGBTQ people may be more frequently mislabeled as sex addicts, says Prause. A 2014 review in Current Sexual Health Reports found a lack of scientific evidence for porn addiction\u2014which is often studied for sex addiction research because it\u2019s easier to show people images of sex than to sexually stimulate them\u2014and pointed out that a disproportionate number of those who report it are LGBTQ people with religious conflicts. \u201cAssessments claiming to help diagnose \u2018sex addiction\u2019 are well-replicated to discriminate against gay men,\u201d said Prause. \u201cQuestionnaires identify more gay men as having a problem than is statistically reasonable. I think the overrepresentation of homosexual men in sex addiction centers is strong evidence that the diagnosis is primarily used for social control of sexuality, rather than treating any actual disease that should affect all men equally.\u201d\n\nSex workers are also pathologized. Daniella Valenti, a 32-year-old legal sex worker in Hawaii and Nevada, was put into therapy by an anti-trafficking program and diagnosed with sex addiction. \u201cSex is my job, and I am super safe with it. I'm not addicted to anything, and I'm not a danger to myself or anyone else. I don't display any type of compulsive behavior,\" she said. \u201cI think my psychologist was judging me for enjoying sex work and labeling it as a disorder because it's a reality he didn't want to accept.\"\n\nPrause said issues involving sexual behavior should be addressed individually, rather than grouped together as an addiction. \u201cIf you are failing to consistently use condoms when you should, there are excellent empirically supported interventions to improve condom use,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you are engaging in sex outside your monogamy agreement with a partner, there are excellent empirically supported interventions to treat infidelity that include risk reduction. If you are having sex to deal with depression, there are dozens of excellent empirically supported treatments for depression.\"\n\nNevertheless, some women believe in the value of the sex addiction model. Erica Garza, author of Getting Off: One Woman's Journey Through Sex and Porn Addiction, said SLAA meetings\u2014which prompted her to give up sex, porn, and masturbation for various periods of time\u2014and other sex addiction treatments helped her replace her compulsions with healthier behavioral patterns. \u201cI'm less likely to seek out the shame-and-pleasure combo I was hooked on,\" she said. \"I have revised my learned beliefs that sex is something dirty and bad [...] so that I can engage in healthy, honest, safe, yet still open-minded sex.\u201d\n\nAlexandra Katehakis, sex therapist and Clinical Director for the Center for Healthy Sex, argued that sex addiction is real, pointing to a study in JAMA Network Open showing that 8.6 percent of Americans report \u201cclinically relevant levels of distress and/or impairment associated with difficulty controlling sexual feelings, urges, and behaviors.\u201d She isn\u2019t against alternative labels like compulsive sexual behavior, but she believes they are separate from sex addiction. Sex addiction is characterized by feelings of withdrawal when someone ceases certain sexual behaviors, desensitization, and always seeking the next \u201chigh,\u201d according to her approach, while sexual compulsivity is more about problems with impulse control.\n\nIf someone thinks they\u2019re a sex addict because of a conservative upbringing or gender norms, Katehakis won't treat them for sex addiction. But if their sexual behavior causes harm or feels out of control to them, she will use cognitive behavioral therapy to help them stop whatever behaviors they feel are destructive. \u201cBoth sides have to be careful about either minimizing the problem, or making something into a problem that\u2019s not really a problem,\u201d she said.\n\nToday, Taylor has a happy sex life that has included an open relationship and multiple casual partners. The solution to using sex to cope with anxiety and depression was not to have less sex, but to begin seeing a therapist and learning to communicate with others about her mental health and reduce shame around sex. \u201cMy relationship to sex is beautiful because it's so authentic, but most important, because it's mine,\u201d she said. \u201cI have the kind of sex that I want to have, with men that I want to have sex with, as little or as often as I please, and I don't see any need to explain it to anyone who doesn't understand.\u201d", "description": "Mental health experts and former \"addicts\" believe that the term is outmoded and inaccurate.
