Nigel Farage tell Piers Morgan on Good Morning Britain that Boris Johnson is honour-bound to tender his resignation to Parliament after getting scolded by a unanimous Supreme Court. He\u2019s so convinced of this, in fact, that Farage clipped out this segment and sent it out on Twitter.\n\nNote well, however, that this doesn\u2019t mean Farage has lost sympathy with \u2014 or confidence in \u2014 Johnson as Prime Minister:\n\nAs a matter of honour, @BorisJohnson must go to the House of Commons and offer his resignation. pic.twitter.com/O3rhzCQnEW \u2014 Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) September 25, 2019\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court is a political court set up by Tony Blair, it\u2019s rule he [Johnson] was unlawful, for the life of me Piers can\u2019t find out what rule he has broken,\u201d the guest stated. \u201cThat\u2019s what they\u2019ve ruled and they are the highest court in the land, they say he gave the Monarch bad advice. \u201cI think as a matter of honour he has to come to the House of Commons and offer his resignation and put it to a vote. \u201cI don\u2019t see anyway round that,\u201d Farage told the presenters.\n\nIn short, Farage is arguing that tradition and form require Johnson to at least offer his resignation in the face of such a sharp rebuke over his actions. That\u2019s surprising for someone perceived to be a populist demolisher of unresponsive institutions, but Farage\u2019s populism is specifically targeted at the EU. He wants a completely sovereign UK again, with Parliament the institution through which the people exercise their governmental sovereignty and the monarchy through which they exercise their ceremonial sovereignty. Those institutions have their form and traditions, and Farage is advising that Johnson abide by them in order to sustain the model.\n\nHowever, Farage hasn\u2019t turned into a Remainer, and a resignation would be a shrewd tactical move. It would require a vote, at least as Farage sees it, which would be the equivalent of a no-confidence motion. And if Parliament does accept Johnson\u2019s resignation, they will be left with no choice but to call an election, as that would leave the UK without any credible negotiator with the EU on the eve of Brexit. If Parliament refused to accept his resignation, Johnson could argue that he\u2019s been bolstered in his last-minute negotiations with the EU.\n\nWill Farage\u2019s strategy bear fruit? Johnson\u2019s opposition have been demanding his resignation today, too:\n\nBoris Johnson is a \u201czombie prime minister\u201d who must leave office, according to the SNP\u2019s Westminster leader Ian Blackford. Opposition politicians have been calling for Mr Johnson to resign after the UK\u2019s highest court on Tuesday ruled that his suspension of Parliament was unlawful. \u2026 \u201cHe has shut down Parliament in a manner which is unlawful and he needs to be held to account for that. They really have to accept responsibility as to why they have behaved in a manner which is unlawful. \u201cWhen you put this into a broader context that this is a zombie Prime Minister, a zombie Government, doesn\u2019t have a majority, he\u2019s lost six votes in the short time that he\u2019s been Prime Minister \u2013 he needs to go. We need to have a general election.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what Johnson has been demanding, and in fact demanded yesterday again. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also wants Johnson\u2019s resignation but doesn\u2019t want snap elections, which is a very strange position to take. That would mean that the Tories would form yet another government in the current parliament while pursuing the same Brexit strategy as Johnson, wasting a lot of time on both sides of the English Channel to end up right back in the same place under Jacob Rees-Mogg or another hard-line Brexiter.\n\nBlackford at least understands the problem. The Brexit question has come to an impasse in Parliament, and that should have already prompted a general election last May. It doesn\u2019t require another referendum but another general election to see where British voters place their trust. It\u2019s pretty clear from Corbyn\u2019s contortions that he knows they won\u2019t place their trust in him no matter how much Johnson might screw up. Farage\u2019s advice here is to break the logjam by forcing Corbyn to eat his words.\n\nAnd of course, Johnson doubled down with Parliament in his first appearance, demanding that they allow him to fish or finally cut bait themselves:", "description": "SNP: \"Zombie prime minister\" must go.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/farage-resign.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
