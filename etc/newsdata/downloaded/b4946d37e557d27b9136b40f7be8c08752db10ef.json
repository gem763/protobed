That means using the knife, of course, but also a range of weapons that deal area damage but don\u2019t count against the player\u2019s accuracy rating, like rocket launchers, grenades and the mine thrower.\n\nWhile that might make it sound a bit easier than a knife-only run, it\u2019s far from it, as there are sections of the game where you need to handle things remotely without harming other characters (like Ashley when she needs defending), so using weapons like the mine thrower takes, ironically, a great deal of accuracy, since you need to be dealing splash damage only to enemies.\n\nAlso notable are some of the tricks involved in gaming Resident Evil 4's ammo system, like stocking up on handgun ammo so that dead enemies wouldn\u2019t drop more of it, and how other types of ammo needed to be protected at all costs, since they were needed to clear certain parts of the game since more traditional means weren\u2019t available as part of the challenge.\n\nYou can read more about Manekimoney\u2019s run here.", "description": "Straight speedruns and feats of skill are always impressive, but sometimes it\u2019s just as impressive to see a game completed where someone has found an interesting way to make things hard for themselves....", "authors": ["Joshua Rivera", "Keza Macdonald"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/xonghqotedcafxz3vcon.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
