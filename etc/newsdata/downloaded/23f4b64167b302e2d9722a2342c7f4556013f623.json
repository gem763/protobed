After competition between two telephone bidders, it was hammered down by the auctioneer Oliver Barker for 1 million pounds, more than three times the estimate and a new auction high for a work solely by the artist, according to Sotheby\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThen we heard an alarm go off,\u201d Morgan Long, the head of art investment at the London-based advisory firm Fine Art Group, who was sitting in the front row of the room, said in an interview on Saturday. \u201cEveryone turned round, and the picture had slipped through its frame.\u201d\n\nThe painting, mounted on a wall close to a row of Sotheby\u2019s staff members, had been shredded, or at least partially shredded, by a remote-control mechanism on the back of the frame.", "description": "The British street artist Banksy appeared to pull off one of his most spectacular pranks on Friday night, with a frame that shredded his \u201cGirl With Balloon\u201d after it sold.", "authors": ["Scott Reyburn"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/08/arts/07banksy/07banksy-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2018-10-06"}
