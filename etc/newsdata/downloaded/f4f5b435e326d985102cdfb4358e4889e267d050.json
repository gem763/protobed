Tragically, the woman Sandile was engaged to died in August last year before they could marry and the mix-up hadn't been resolved yet.\n\nThe provincial home affairs manager, Cyril Mncwabe, told DRUM they had the Mkhize family's documents and hoped to find a solution to the issue soon.\n\n\"This situation is very uncommon. I am following up on the issue and with the help of the department, we will get to the bottom of this and see that the man is assisted.\"\n\nSandile's parents got married on November 11, 1994. At that time, Sandile was just 14 years old and too young to legally get married. Yet, according to home affairs' records, he married his mother on November 12, 1994.\n\n\"There are two marriage certificates. It is my parents' marriage certificate and the one where I'm supposedly married to my mother,\" Sandile told Isolezwe.\n\n\"This whole thing has really taken its toll on my life,\" Sandile added, saying his inability to marry the woman he loved was only one of the issues the mix-up has caused.", "description": "Four years ago Sandile Mkhize found out he was married to his mother, and his life has been on hold ever since.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7988/20f80122adc742c59317194192285c3d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
