It was, at best, a rash promise for how nuclear fusion might make the UK carbon-neutral by the middle of the century \u2013 the target recommended by the Committee on Climate Change, which advises the government. \u201cI know they have been on the verge for some time,\u201d Johnson hedged. \u201cIt is a pretty spacious kind of verge.\u201d But now, he assured his audience, \u201cwe are on the verge of the verge\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s a familiar and bitter joke about nuclear fusion as an energy source that, ever since it was first mooted in the 1950s, it has been 30 years away. Johnson\u2019s comments had the extra irony that Brexit could merely add to that distance.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what \u201ccommercially viable miniature fusion reactors\u201d the prime minister had in mind. There are no such things either existing or planned at the main British centre for fusion research, the Joint European Torus (Jet) at Culham in Oxfordshire, which Johnson visited in August. Experiments at Jet, conducted by all partners within the 28-state Eurofusion consortium, aim to make the nuclear fusion of hydrogen \u2013 the process that powers the sun and other stars \u2013 viable for energy generation by collecting the heat released to drive turbines for electricity. When Jet is running, the temperature inside is more than 100m C, making it \u201cthe hottest place in the solar system\u201d according to Jet\u2019s director, Ian Chapman.\n\nNuclear fusion is the merging of atoms. Every atom contains a very dense central blob called the nucleus, made up of particles called protons and neutrons. Atoms of different chemical elements have nuclei with different numbers of protons. If two nuclei collide at high enough energy, they can amalgamate to form a different, heavier element. It requires very high temperatures and densities: inside the sun, temperatures of 10m C or so enable hydrogen atoms to fuse into helium. This process releases energy, which makes the sun shine.\n\nToday\u2019s nuclear power plants use not fusion but nuclear fission: the splitting apart of heavy nuclei. This happens spontaneously for radioactive elements such as uranium, and it too releases energy. But both the fuel and the products may remain highly radioactive for very long times \u2013 hundreds of thousands of years \u2013 creating health hazards and waste-disposal problems. What\u2019s more, the fission process, which involves chain reactions that induce fission, can be hard to control and shut down, as the Chernobyl and Fukushima disasters, in Ukraine and Japan, showed. Fusion is \u201cnuclear power done right\u201d \u2013 potentially much cleaner, safer and more efficient. \u201cIt seems too good to be true \u2013 high power density, low and manageable waste production, and no possibility of uncontrolled energy release,\u201d says Tim Luce, chief scientist on the large international fusion project Iter, in the south of France. \u201cBut it is true!\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Inside the tokamak at Culham, Oxfordshire.

Its reactor induces fusion in a super-hot plasma of hydrogen fuel suspended by magnetic fields inside a doughnut-shaped device called a tokamak \u2013 the word is a Russian acronym, the design having first been proposed in the 1950s by Soviet physicists.\n\nIn 1997 Jet set a world record for the highest ratio of energy out to energy in. But that was still just two-thirds of the break-even point where the reactor isn\u2019t consuming energy overall. Jet was always intended as an experimental facility, however, and it will eventually hand on the baton to the $20bn Iter project, on which the EU and six other nations, including the United States, Russia and China, are collaborating. The construction of Iter is now nearing completion at Cadarache, near Aix-en-Provence. It hopes to conduct its first experimental runs in 2025, and eventually to produce 500 megawatts (MW) of power \u2013 10 times as much as is needed to operate it. \u201cThe role of Iter is to realise power-plant levels of power and gain, and to begin to address the technological needs of power plants,\u201d says Luce.\n\nThe fuel used in these and other fusion reactors is not ordinary hydrogen \u2013 the lightest element, with a nucleus containing just one proton \u2013 but heavier hydrogen isotopes called deuterium and tritium, which also have neutrons in their nuclei. The presence of neutrons lets fusion happen under less extreme conditions of temperature and pressure. Deuterium is abundant: it makes up 0.02% of all the natural hydrogen in seawater, from which it can be extracted. But tritium is very rare and radioactive, disintegrating with a half-life of 12 and a quarter years.\n\nTritium can be produced directly at a fusion facility by using the neutrons released as nuclei fuse to break apart lithium atoms, so that a reactor may \u201cbreed\u201d its own fuel. It can also be extracted from heavy (deuterium-rich) water, which is how Jet gets it. But it\u2019s costly, so deuterium-tritium fuel is only used on major test runs. Jet plans to conduct one next year \u2013 the first since the record-breaking demonstration in 1997. \u201cWe remain very optimistic that we\u2019ll break the world record for fusion energy produced,\u201d says Chapman. \u201cEveryone is very excited because we haven\u2019t done it for 20 years.\u201d Iter, meanwhile, hopes to start using deuterium-tritium fuel in 2035.\n\nJet won\u2019t be jeopardised by Brexit. Chapman says that \u201cwe\u2019ve signed a contract to operate Jet to the end of 2020, whatever happens with Brexit. And we\u2019re already talking with our European partners about an extension to the end of 2024.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An artist\u2019s illustration of nuclear fusion.

The country\u2019s membership of the project comes through its affiliation with the European atomic energy programme Euratom \u2013 which is coupled to EU membership. \u201cIf you leave one, you leave the other,\u201d says Tony Donn\u00e9, programme manager of Eurofusion. With a withdrawal agreement, he says, \u201cin principle the UK could stay in Euratom until the end of 2020, and then it\u2019s in an easier position to negotiate for associate membership, as Switzerland already has\u201d. But without one, the UK would need to renegotiate a fresh position in Iter from scratch. That\u2019s possible \u2013 Ukraine has done it \u2013 but Donn\u00e9 says: \u201cIt would take a long time and I don\u2019t know how it would go.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cIn fusion, we have a tradition to work internationally, so it would be a pity if the UK [were to] drop out.\u201d Even if it eventually became possible to rejoin Iter, \u201cBritish industries might lose their chance of orders, and then when the UK comes back in in a few years\u2019 time, maybe all the nice orders will have been given to other companies.\u201d\n\nNot everything depends on these big international collaborations, however. The British government has given \u00a3220m to a UK-based project called Step (the Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production), which aims to build a working fusion reactor that will feed 100MW into the national grid by 2040. Later phases of the project will be cofunded by industry, and Step\u2019s director Howard Wilson, a physicist at the University of York, says that it will benefit from the work done in parallel at Iter.\n\nStep uses a different design from Jet or Iter: the aforementioned spherical tokamak. \u201cRather than a ring doughnut, it looks more like a cored apple,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cThe hole in the middle is much smaller.\u201d This makes the reactor more compact and therefore potentially cheaper (that, perhaps, is what Johnson had in mind when alluding to \u201cminiature\u201d fusion reactors). But the spherical shape also creates problems, in particular dealing with the greater concentration of heat.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges is the damage caused to the reactor materials by the extreme heat and the intense doses of neutron radiation. Iter won\u2019t suffer too much of that because it will only run for short bursts. But a commercial reactor would need to operate more frequently, if not continuously, to be economically viable. Since Step will run more in that manner, it will need to tackle this crucial engineering issue.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The construction of Iter, France. Photograph: Iter\n\nThe United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) has explored spherical tokamaks since building the world\u2019s first prototype, called Start (the Small Tight Aspect Ratio Tokamak), in the 1990s. This design is also favoured by some of the small startup companies now trying to develop commercial fusion, such as Tokamak Energy, based at Milton Park, a few miles south of Culham in Abingdon. They hope to create a reactor small enough to fit on to the back of a lorry; the idea is that such systems could provide power locally to a factory or a town. But these companies \u2013 others exist in the US and Canada \u2013 are nowhere near having market-ready devices.\n\nThe bigger projects welcome this injection of diversity. \u201cWe don\u2019t see ourselves as in competition with the startups, but as complementary,\u201d says Wilson. Chapman agrees: \u201cThe more bright people working on the problems, the better. I don\u2019t think any of those companies is going to design and build a working reactor, but they might innovate on a particular component and help drive down the costs or improve performance.\u201d\n\nThe idea of having a nuclear reactor on the edge of town might sound alarming. But that\u2019s largely because we have become familiar with the dangers of fission \u2013 the radioactive waste and the spectre of Chernobyl-style meltdowns. Fusion is different: there\u2019s no real risk of it getting out of control, and much less radiation hazard. Chapman likens the process to a gas oven: \u201cFusion stops almost instantaneously once you stop fuelling it\u201d, and a reactor typically only contains about one second\u2019s worth of fuel at any moment. The challenge, he says, is to keep it going: \u201cI\u2019ve spent most of my career trying to do that.\u201d\n\nNo one believes that fusion will solve the immediate climate crisis. It\u2019s not expected to come online until 2050, by which time many scientists say carbon emissions will already need to have fallen to zero to avoid the most serious climate impacts. But neither can renewables such as wind and solar power solve the problem on their own \u2013 their intermittency and low power density means, for example, that you couldn\u2019t power large cities that way. Fusion will be perfect in that situation, says Donn\u00e9, and he predicts it will be a major component of global energy generation in the second half of this century.\n\n\u201cI came to fusion because I passionately believe that it is needed \u2013 that it can change the world,\u201d says Chapman. \u201cI\u2019m convinced that not only is fusion important: it\u2019s going to happen.\u201d We\u2019re not on the verge, but it\u2019s just about in sight.", "description": "Scientists pursuing the holy grail of energy generation are taking giant steps", "authors": ["Philip Ball"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c8580ed342c75999f35ce723b44aba8c2919d19/0_414_5353_3212/master/5353.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=aa75825e0d6a4dbd718b03e83cc4dffd", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
