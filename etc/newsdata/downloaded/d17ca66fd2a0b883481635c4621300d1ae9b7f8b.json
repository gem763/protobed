But there is nothing traditional about esports, nor Harrisburg University.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe school\u2019s esports training facility is state-of-the-art. DC comic books, Lego action figures and vibrating massage therapy balls lie scattered next to HP OMEN monitors and ergonomic gaming chairs. The 2,500-square-foot space, known as Stage 2, is a gamer\u2019s haven.\n\nSince 2017, Harrisburg has invested heavily in its esports program. In preparation for its inaugural season, the university embarked on a $750,000 project to build the on-campus facility. Harrisburg\u2019s communications director, Steve Infanti, estimated the total annual budget at $2 million for the esports teams, including coaching and staff salaries, facilities, technology, travel and event production.\n\nThe thinking behind the move is twofold. Investing in the emerging field of competitive gaming can help separate Harrisburg from other schools, giving it a way to appeal to students who otherwise may not have been interested in the tiny school in central Pennsylvania. Second, by aggressively moving into the territory, Harrisburg can establish its brand through gaming while other, better-known institutions with deeper coffers aren\u2019t involved. If the university can establish a brand of excellence in college esports similar to what traditional powerhouses such as Alabama or Duke have done in football and basketball, the thinking goes, it can elevate the profile of the school as a whole.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we have to move as quickly as we can to differentiate ourselves and to build a reputation,\" said Eric Darr, the school\u2019s president. \"And in some sense, [the goal is to] become the Notre Dame of esports \u2014 a smaller, private, independent [university] that can keep pace and, on any given day, beat the big guys.\u201d\n\nThe Harrisburg University Storm \u2014 the varsity esports program that fields teams in Overwatch, League of Legends and Hearthstone \u2014 has many points of pride. In the program\u2019s first year, the Overwatch team won the 2019 ESPN Collegiate Esports Championship. The six players competing in the finals turned down offers from professional teams in the Overwatch League. The program also recently won an international Tempest Award for \u201cBest Collegiate Esports Program,\" beating out schools such as UC Berkeley, UC Irvine and Utah.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely increased the recognition for the university,\u201d Darr said. \u201cWe\u2019ve generated sponsorships for the team, so we\u2019ve generated revenue in a way that we haven\u2019t been able to before.\" The school\u2019s sponsorships include Intel, HP and D&H Distributing.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also programmatic opportunities for us, meaning expanding our academic programs to provide sports management and audio-video production programs to support esports events,\" Darr added. \"There\u2019s a whole burgeoning and growing esports industry, and there\u2019s a whole workforce that\u2019s needed to support that industry. We\u2019d like to be one of the universities that supports the education of that workforce.\u201d\n\nHarrisburg isn\u2019t alone in its approach to using esports to attract students to a small school. Maryville University, based in St. Louis, won the Harrisburg University Esports Invitational in League of Legends and Overwatch. Full Sail University in Orlando and Robert Morris University Illinois in Chicago also have devoted significant resources to esports programs.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSmaller schools are extremely interested [in adding programs] because of recruitment and retention,\u201d said Victoria Horsley, head of marketing at the National Association of Collegiate Esports (NACE). The NACE is one of several esports regulatory operations at the college level. \u201cThey see esports is popular so they want to jump in and try to grab all the students in their market as soon as they can.\u201d\n\nAs schools with larger student pools add esports programs, the Storm and its small-school peers will face stiffer competition, in both their gaming matchups and recruiting. NACE membership nearly tripled to around 200 teams in the past year. Only a fifth of its members are also Division I institutions in the NCAA, which has so far declined to govern collegiate esports.\n\n\u201cSome colleges are just kind of dipping their toe into esports,\u201d said Chad Smeltz, the Storm\u2019s program director. \u201cThey\u2019re feeling it out because they know it\u2019s something they should look into, but more schools are actually committing to it and wanting to do more.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSmeltz, a former professional gamer and team manager, said the secret to the Storm\u2019s success lies in how the university supports the program. For example, players are scouted online and selectively recruited, just as any other elite college athlete is. Each of the 26 roster members receives a full-tuition scholarship and housing stipend, which is better than what most athletic programs offer.\n\nThe players also commit to the program knowing they will undergo a demanding training and academic schedule, which includes mandatory physical training, regimented meal plans, study hall, four-hour daily practices and a full course-load in which they must maintain a 2.0 GPA to remain on the team.\n\n\u201cOur team here is no different than my experience I had as a college athlete,\u201d said Ryan Korn, who runs the university\u2019s high school partnerships program. \u201cI had a full [scholarship] for football. The experiences [that players] have with regards to training, with having the work-life balance between their sport and college \u2026 that\u2019s how it was for me.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe program has rapidly claimed a spot within the university\u2019s culture and the surrounding community. Students wear Storm gear to class. The school president knows each of the players on a first-name basis and regularly attends their events. Classes were canceled for two days in September when the school hosted its invitational tournament, which drew 64 teams from across the country.\n\nJoshua Street, also known by his gamertag, \u201cLikeAMaws,\u201d is a fourth-year player on the Storm\u2019s League of Legends team. He said that while he doesn\u2019t feel like a celebrity, he occasionally gets stopped by strangers when he\u2019s walking around campus and is asked whether he\u2019s on the team. When he says yes, the response is usually, \u201cThat\u2019s so cool!\u201d or \u201cHow is that?\"\n\n\u201cThe initial goal of having the scholarships and having all the players here on-site is to help foster a community,\u201d Street said. \u201cAnd I know that one of the drivers the school had for even creating this program is to kind of make Harrisburg flourish again.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDarr agreed, saying he was inspired to launch the program last year in response to students\u2019 growing interest in gaming. He wanted to create a program that would have a lasting impact.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t do what other people were doing,\" Darr said. \"Which is, \u2018Here\u2019s a glorified computer lab or a rehabbed classroom, and we\u2019re going to call that the home of our esports.\u2019 That\u2019s not going to make an impact. That\u2019s not going to raise brand awareness, and that\u2019s just not good enough.\u201d\n\nSo far, the university has done more than \u201cgood enough,\u201d putting Harrisburg on the national (and even international) esports map. For now at least, the program is enjoying the view from above.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to big schools getting in,\u201d Smeltz said. \u201cWhen they get in, depending on the school, there will probably be an attitude of, you know, \u2018We\u2019re Penn State\u2019 or we\u2019re this or whatever, 'and we\u2019re going to be the best.\u2019 And they\u2019re not going to be the best right off the bat, because it takes a lot of work to start up. \u2026\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be kind of funny to see that adaptation.\u201d\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nAD", "description": "Harrisburg University has pumped millions into establishing itself in competitive gaming, with esports serving as its only varsity program.", "authors": ["Alex Andrejev", "Sports Intern"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/wQcCtacoALYPAYnA_CiOAAbSCKw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AOALSFFE6BFSDKK3Y36PFX7PCI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
