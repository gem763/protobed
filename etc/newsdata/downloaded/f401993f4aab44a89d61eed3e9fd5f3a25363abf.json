The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.21% was just 1,000 in the early 1980s, when most boomers were first entering the workplace.\n\nSo after all this good luck, where are they now?\n\nA new study has the numbers. And they aren\u2019t pretty.\n\n\u201cBoomer Expectations for Retirement,\u201d a new annual study from the Insured Retirement Institute \u2014 a trade body for the annuity industry \u2014 makes shocking reading. Most boomers are unprepared for retirement, even as they approach it or enter it. Amazingly, barely one in 10 has enough saved up.\n\nThis is hardly the first study to report on Americans\u2019 poor retirement savings. But the IRI survey stands out because it focuses specifically on boomers. They interviewed 804 people aged 56 to 72.\n\nIn a nutshell, based on their numbers, about 11% have at least $500,000 saved for their retirement. That\u2019s hardly a king\u2019s ransom, but it may have to do.\n\nThe remainder don\u2019t even have that.\n\nNearly half don\u2019t have any retirement savings at all. None.\n\nYikes. Good times ahead. About half of those who make it into their early 60s will live past 85. How they\u2019re going to get by without savings is anyone\u2019s guess.\n\nOK, OK. Financial surveys about retirement planning are generally produced by organizations in the financial services industry, and naturally they have a point of view. The IRI represents annuity providers. And, yes, the survey results suggest that, all in all, more people really should buy annuities when they retire. Make of that what you will. But the study is useful all the same.\n\nAmong the benefits: It shows an astonishing seven \u201cdeadly sins\u201d of retirement planning which have led so many to this dismal situation.\n\nHere are seven things not to do when planning for your retirement.\n\n1. Not saving enough \u2014 or anything. Yes, it\u2019s the most obvious but it\u2019s worth repeating. According to the IRI survey, an astonishing 23% of baby boomers have no retirement savings\u2026 and never did.\n\n2. Draining your retirement savings. Another 17% did save for their retirement once\u2026 but then spent the money, either in desperation, or carelessness, or maybe both.\n\n3. Not calculating a retirement savings goal. It\u2019s a lot harder to save enough for retirement if you haven\u2019t first at least tried to work out how much that\u2019s supposed to be. Astonishingly, just 25% of boomers who do not have a financial adviser have tried to run the numbers. And even 25% of those who do have a financial adviser still haven\u2019t set a target. Um\u2026 what?\n\n4. Underestimating health costs. Here\u2019s a sobering item: A 2018 analysis estimated that a healthy couple in their mid-60s may need to budget between a third and half a million dollars for their health care expenses, including supplementary insurance, copays and other out of pocket expenses. Yet most near-retirees don\u2019t have a clue. According to the IRI survey, more than half of boomers think their health care costs will come to less than 20% of their retirement income, and more than one in four think they will come to less than 10%.\n\nRead: Health-care costs in retirement continue to rise \u2014 here\u2019s what you need to know\n\n5. Ignoring long-term care costs. Yet nearly 70% of those in their mid-60s are going to need some kind of long-term care, and the average cost a year is $89,000 a year. Who\u2019s going to pay? \u201cMedicare,\u201d say 46% of baby boomers surveyed. Yes, really. Uh\u2026 folks: Medicare doesn\u2019t pay for long-term care. Not a nickel.\n\n6. Mishandling your retirement date. On the one hand, some people have been forced to postpone retirement because they couldn\u2019t afford it. Some 29% of those aged 62 to 66 have postponed their retirement, and a remarkable 33% of those aged 67 to 72. On the other hand, others overestimate how long they\u2019ll be able to keep working. Some 31% of boomers predict they\u2019ll work past 70\u2026 but studies have found fewer than 10% actually do.\n\n7. Not setting affairs in order. Possibly the most astonishing revelation in the survey is buried in the footnotes: About two-thirds of boomers have taken no steps to protect themselves if they suffer diminished capacity or dementia. They haven\u2019t spelled out their wishes for their care and end of life. They haven\u2019t sorted out a power of attorney for when one is needed. And as anyone who has been through this process can tell you, the chances are pretty high that if you wait to do this stuff until it\u2019s needed, it\u2019s going to be too late.", "description": "New survey shows why millions are unprepared.", "authors": ["Brett Arends"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HH242_big_ch_ZG_20190409122248.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-09"}
