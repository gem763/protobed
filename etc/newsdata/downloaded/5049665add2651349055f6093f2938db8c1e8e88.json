who entered the tournament as favourites.\n\nEngland fans were confident their team could reach its first Rugby World Cup semi-final since 2007, having defeated Australia in the past six encounters.\n\nThe Australia rivalry has been elevated even more since Eddie Jones joined the side as England's coach - he managed the Wallabies when they lost to England in the 2003 World Cup final.\n\nSpeaking after the game, a smiling Jones said: 'I'm so pleased for the players, they've worked so hard to get this result.'\n\nHe also relished the prospect of facing the All Blacks in the semi-final, saying that he'd 'love to play New Zealand'.\n\nToday's 24-point triumph is England's largest ever win over the Wallabies and won plaudits including 2003 World Cup legend Johnny Wilkinson.\n\nThe 2019 World Cup is the first time the tournament has been hosted by an Asian country since its 1987 inception, with travelling fans advised to respect Japan's culture.\n\nFearing that overseas supporters will drink the Japanese outlets dry, official tournament sponsor Heineken has reportedly increased its beer production by 80 per cent.\n\nSecond row England player Maro Itoje poses for a selfie after thrashing Australia in the grudge quarter-final clash\n\nEngland fans (pictured outside the ground) will be confident their team can reach its first Rugby World Cup semi-final since 2007, having defeated Australia in the past six encounters\n\nChants of Swing Low Sweet Chariot echoed throughout the stadium which was flooded by around 20,000 travelling England fans (pictured with locals)\n\nAn England fan watches from the stands in Oita stadium for today's quarter-final clash against bitter rivals Australia\n\nThe Australia rivalry has been elevated even more since Eddie Jones (right with captain Owen Farrell) joined the side as England's coach, as he managed the Wallabies when they lost to England in the 2003 World Cup final\n\nJapan will also hope to reach the semi-final after a string of unexpected victories which has fired up the host nation (a supporter sports both England and Australia colours)\n\nEngland scored the first try through winger Jonny May who dived over the whitewash in the 18th minute and again in the 20t\n\nThe country was rocked last week by Typhoon Hagibis, which saw 120mph winds batter the eastern coast and forced England's final group stage match against France to be cancelled.\n\nEager not to miss today's match, people in England awoke early to go to the pubs, many of which opened their bars especially for the event.\n\nPunters at The Cabbage Patch, which is a stone's throw from Twickenham, have been promised a free pint of Guinness or a cup of coffee if they book their spot in advance.\n\nFullers said customers can log onto their website Fullers.co.uk to find a bar near them that will be showing the game.\n\nThe Black Bear Burger pop up in Shoreditch has even created a special menu, which includes a Black Muffin, with free range pork shoulder patty, American cheese, black pudding, bacon and Bloody Mary ketchup.\n\nAfter wins against Tonga, the USA and Argentina, England topped Pool C, which pitted them against the runners up in Pool A, Australia, who lost only against Wales.\n\nAll home nations except Scotland emerged from the pool stages into the knock-outs, with Wales and Ireland both in action this weekend against France and New Zealand respectively.\n\nJapan will also hope to reach the semi-final after a string of unexpected victories which has fired up the host nation.\n\nAll home nations except Scotland emerged from the pool stages into the knock-outs, with Wales and Ireland both in action this weekend against France and New Zealand respectively (Irish and New Zealand flags are waved)\n\nEnglish fans enjoy some light-hearted jokes with an Australia fan outside the ground at today's quarter-final clash\n\nRugby fans dressed in the Wallabies golden colours and English white walk to the Oita Stadium prior to the Rugby World Cup match between England and Australia, in Oita\n\nMatch report: Eddie Jones' men score FORTY points over old rivals as they book a spot in the semi-finals of the Rugby World Cup for the first time in 12 years... now it's either Ireland or New Zealand\n\nBy Nik Simon at the Oita Stadium for the Mail on Sunday\n\nTwelve years of waiting, four years of preparation, 80 minutes of toil and one huge moment of relief.\n\nFor the first time since 2007, England are through to the World Cup semi-finals.\n\nThis was a rampant victory in Oita. They drew out their samurai sword to kill off Australia with a statement scoreline. A victory that will make the world stand up and take notice.\n\nAll hail Eddie Jones\u2019 bold selections. It was boom-or-bust for the England coach and his decisions paid off.\n\nBack in the No 10 jersey, Owen Farrell was immaculate with the boot.\n\nBack in the No 13 jersey, Henry Slade produced a game-changing moment with a deft kick up there with the best.\n\nJonny May adds his second try of the match to increase Eddie Jones' side's advantage in their quarter-final clash on Saturday\n\nMay celebrates with his team-mates including George Ford (right) who was left out of the starting line-up on Saturday\n\nFarrell was as reliable as ever with his kicking as he converts England's second try of the match during the first half\n\nAnd in the forwards, Sam Underhill and Tom Curry outplayed and outmuscled the iconic pairing of David Pocock and Michael Hooper.\n\nEngland\u2019s players gathered in a huddle on the final whistle and breathed a sigh of relief that has been building up since 2015.\n\nMATCH SQUADS England: Daly, Watson, Slade, Tuilagi, May, Farrell, Youngs, M. Vunipola, George, Sinckler, Itoje, Lawes, Curry, Underhill, B. Vunipola. Replacements: Cowan-Dickie, Marler, Cole, Kruis, Ludlam, Heinz, Ford, Joseph. Australia: Beale, Hodge, Petaia, Kerevi, Koroibete, Lealiifano, Genia, Sio, Latu, Alaalatoa, Rodda, Arnold, Pocock, Hooper, Naisarani. Replacements: Uelese, Slipper, Tupou, Coleman, Salakaia-Loto, White, Toomua, O'Connor. Referee: Jerome Garces (France)\n\nBefore kick-off, the Oita air is filled with scattered clouds from the hot springs and an eggy smell of sulphur. There was also a whiff of concern about what lay ahead for an undercooked side whose match against France was blown out by the typhoon.\n\nFor the opening 10 minutes, England looked riddled by nerves. Australia were all-out-attack.\n\nThey launched an early 18-siege phase on England\u2019s line, with Will Genia setting the tempo from the base of the ruck. Aged 19, Jordan Petaia was tipped for a baptism of fire on his first Test start at centre, but he played the opening 10 minutes like a young Sonny Bill Williams.\n\nEngland had to make 30 tackles in the opening minutes, as the Wallabies antagonised Kyle Sinckler at the scrum with elbows and head pats. With 12 minutes on the clock, Billy Vunipola was penalised for a high tackle and Christian Lealifano kicked the opening points.\n\nThis was the game that England \u2013 and Eddie Jones \u2013 simply could not afford to lost. The RFU have invested millions of pounds into Jones\u2019 win-at-all-costs campaign and a quarter final defeat would have represented a catastrophic failure. The walls back at Twickenham would be covered in blood.\n\nReaching the semi-final is a \u2018pass\u2019. Fans do not need to change their flights and return to the rainy runways of Heathrow. They are happy. Losing to the All Blacks in the likely semi-final would be nothing other than expected, so Jones is clear of any inquests into where it all went wrong.\n\nEngland soon sussed out Australia\u2019s high-risk strategy and delivered their most comprehensive World Cup performance for years.\n\nFarrell scored three penalties in the second half to put extra daylight between the two sides and put pressure on Australia\n\nKyle Sinckler of England holds off Kurtley Beale of Australia as he touches down to score his team's third try on Saturday\n\nThey made 171 tackles in total, including a notable early hit from Underhill, who dumped Isi Naisarani on his backside. Australia knocked on under pressure and England fed off their scraps like hyenas.\n\nWith Farrell, Slade and Elliot Daly, England were able to quickly moved the ball through one way and another, with Manu Tuilagi dotting the \u2018I\u2019s and crossing the \u2018t\u2019s with busting runs through midfield. With 18 minutes on the clock, the combination play paid off and Curry set up Jonny May on the left wing.\n\nFarrell converted from wide out of the left touchline, overcoming his creaky kicking display against Argentina with the first of a 20-point haul.\n\nWithin minutes, one try became two. Australia were stunned. Slade intercepted a loose pass from Pocock and sprinted out of his own 22. With May screaming and waving in his rearview mirror, Slade poked a kick behind Samu Kerevi. Few players can beat May in a footrace and the winger gave chase to score his second try in three minutes.\n\nAustralia tried to attack from anywhere. Kurtley Beale\u2019s loose chip out of his own 22 almost gifted England a third try, but for a knock on by Slade.\n\nLealifano and Farrell exchanged penalties, but it was England who led 17-9 at half-time.\n\nFarrell's kicking was spot on as he made it four from four to convert Sinckler's try and increase England's advantage\n\nAustralia came flying out the traps early in the second half to stun England as Marika Koroibete crossed over the line to score\n\nLike they did in the first-half, Australia came out of the changing room with intent. Revved up by the words of Michael Cheika, who is now likely to leave his post.\n\nOnce again, Petaia was at the heart of things. The rookie ran at Anthony Watson, who held off to cover Hooper on the outside. But Marika Koroibete ran a steaming line on his inside shoulder, before skinning alive Daly, who looked creaky in defence, to score his side\u2019s first try.\n\nThe next five minutes would define England\u2019s World Cup.\n\nFollowing the lead of Curry and Underhill, Jamie George was next to take over England\u2019s breakdown duties.\n\nFarrell was told to lead from the front with warrior spirit and the No 10 made a charge at the Wallaby line with Billy Vunipola on his shoulder. All green and gold eyes turned to the No 8, but Farrell picked out Sinckler with a bullet flat-pass for the prop to score from 15 metres out.\n\nScenes of jubilation followed and this was to biggest 10 minutes of Sinckler\u2019s career so far. Moments later, he won a penalty at the scrum. Then the Wallabies turned down a penalty to opt for a scrum and, lo behold, it was the lad from Battersea who ripped the ball from the clutches of Naisarani.\n\nPlay switched ends and Farrell edged England out of sight with another penalty. As the clock approached 70 minutes, Eddie Jones brought off George, Underhill and Mako Vunipola. There was still 10 minutes left to play, but England already knew their passage was secure.\n\nWatson intercepted Beale to score late on, with Farrell adding the extras to send England marching on to the next round.\n\nLealifano was very reliable with his kicking before being substituted early in the second half as he converted the try\n\nMay scored the opening try for England against Australia during the 2019 Rugby World Cup quarter-final on Saturday\n\nMay takes out his gumshield and celebrates with his team-mates having given his side the lead early on in the match\n\nOwen Farrell converts May's early try the try to give England the advantage over the Wallabies at the Oita Bank Dome", "description": "As England reached their first semi-final in 12 years, chants of Swing Low Sweet Chariot echoed throughout the Oita stadium which was flooded by around 20,000 travelling England fans.", "authors": ["Jack Elsom For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/11/19918710-0-image-a-134_1571481192047.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
