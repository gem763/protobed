And it made for a nice spread of pictures.\n\nThe adorable collection of images were taken to emulate human passport portraits.\n\nIf any these pooches are planning any holidays this year then their passport photos are sorted.\n\nPhotographer Belinda Richards, 39, from Melbourne, Australia, Creative Director of Frog Dog Studios, said: \u201cNoises and peanut butter are our biggest secret in getting the subjects attention, a fun noise is key to getting that connection with the lens.\n\n\u201cPeanut butter should be in any pet photographer\u2019s arsenal, dogs love it, it gets them to sit still for a couple of minutes while they lick so I can get a huge variety of different facial expressions.\u201d", "description": "These cute dog were more than ready for their portraits by Frog Dog Studios", "authors": ["Charlene Bougourd", "Image", "Frog Dog Studios", "Caters News"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20469250.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_PAY-Doggy-headshot.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
