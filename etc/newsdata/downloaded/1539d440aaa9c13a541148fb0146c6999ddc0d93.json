Scientists said the glacier started to melt in the mid-1980s. By 2009, it had vanished.\n\nThe Inkachaka dam, a few miles outside the La Paz, is currently more than half-full, fed by snowfalls during the austral winter.\n\nBut the year-round snowcaps on nearby mountains, visible as recently as 30 years ago, no longer exist.", "description": "Water resources are running dry in the world's highest-elevation capital due to the combined effect of the Andean glaciers melting, drought and mismanagement.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9386/e44f843c128649cb8204b776ac573393.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
