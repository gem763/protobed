It was a match full of contentious refereeing decisions, yet the Roosters proved their worth by winning back-to-back premierships for the first time in 26 years. Tries to Sam Verrills and James Tedesco were enough to see the Sydney team defeat their opponents from Canberra, who were themselves making their first grand final appearance since 1994. Canberra play-maker Jack Wighton was awarded the Clive Churchill Medal for being the best player on the night, scoring a try in his side's defeat. Champion Roosters half-back, Cooper Cronk, bows out of the NRL after 16 years in the competition, having played 372 games.
