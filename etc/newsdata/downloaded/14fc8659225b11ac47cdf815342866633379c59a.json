But their efforts can easily veer into a ditch where new hires all look, think and act alike. That\u2019s bad for anyone who cares about an office with a mix of races, genders and points of view.\n\n\u201cWhat most people mean by culture fit is hiring people they\u2019d like to have a beer with,\u201d says Patty McCord, a human-resources consultant and former chief talent officer at Netflix. \u201cYou end up with this big, homogenous culture where everybody looks alike, everybody thinks alike, and everybody likes drinking beer at 3 o\u2019clock in the afternoon with the bros,\u201d she says.\n\nHuman-resources consultant Patty McCord says some employers err in trying to attract top talent by offering such frills as office ping pong or the latest craft beer.

But there\u2019s a difference between cultural frills like office ping pong and craft beer, and deeper ones that mean more. To employees, it means loving a job for more than just the paycheck. And to employers, it means employees will keep working hard even when no one is watching.\n\nMaking a good match can be difficult. In a pattern researchers call looking-glass merit, hirers tend to look for traits in candidates that make them feel good about themselves. These may be more nuanced than race or gender. A manager who got bad grades as a college freshman is likely to warm to an applicant who also got off to a rough start, research shows. Or a hirer who attended a low-prestige school may favor applicants who did the same.\n\n\u201cWhat most interviewers are looking for and acting on is more of an intuitive sense of, \u2018Would I get along with this person?\u2019 and that often isn\u2019t very reliable,\u201d says Kirsta Anderson, global head of culture transformation in London for Korn Ferry.\n\nEmployees err in taking a job because it offers office ping pong, free lunches or heated toilet seats. Ms. McCord recently met an HR executive who claimed to keep employees happy by serving up the latest craft beers. \u201cWell, that sounds like a fun vacation. I\u2019d probably go to that resort. But that\u2019s not what you\u2019re here to do,\u201d says Ms. McCord, author of \u201cPowerful,\u201d a book on building workplace cultures.\n\nShare Your Thoughts How can bosses make sure they\u2019re hiring for meaningful shared values rather than superficial sameness? Join the conversation below.\n\nHiring managers need to go deeper and figure out whether applicants are in sync with more fundamental elements of their culture, Ms. Anderson says. Are they excited about how the company innovates, serves customers or makes a social impact? Will they mesh with the way individuals and teams at the company work, by collaborating or competing? And will they naturally make decisions the way the employer wants\u2014individually or as a group, embracing or avoiding risk?\n\nIt isn\u2019t easy to suss out those traits in an interview. Jeanne Leasure, a human-resources executive, recalls interviewing applicants for a job that gave employees a lot of autonomy. She was looking for recruits who were self-starters, but wound up hiring one who turned out to be a lovable slacker. \u201cWe hit it off, we had similar personalities,\u201d and the applicant gave convincing answers when she asked him about past accomplishments, she says. But on the job, he didn\u2019t have as much drive as she\u2019d hoped, says Ms. Leasure, who was recently named senior vice president, people, at SpotX, an ad-tech company based in Broomfield, Colo. She has begun asking more probing questions, such as, \u201cWhat was your work ethic like as a teenager?\u201d\n\nAd-agency founder Ed Mitzen looks for recruits who are empathetic and at ease in his company\u2019s flat, no-titles, team-based culture. Photo: Fingerpaint\n\nFingerpaint Marketing is a flat organization with no lofty job titles, and its teams must work smoothly together on tight deadlines. When Ed Mitzen, founder of the Saratoga Springs, N.Y., agency, interviews candidates, he explores whether they\u2019ll be kind to everyone regardless of status, and pleasant to work with. If teammates enjoy working with them, he reasons the team will get more done and do better work.\n\nHe screens out big egos partly by asking drivers for his company\u2019s car service how candidates treated them en route to and from the interview. \u201cIf they\u2019re a jerk to the car-service guy, that\u2019s a warning sign,\u201d Mr. Mitzen says. He once rejected an applicant partly because he put on airs with the driver and expected him to open the door for him.\n\n\u201cReally? You\u2019re applying for a $150,000-a-year job,\u201d Mr. Mitzen says. \u201cYou\u2019re not applying to be ambassador to France. Take it easy.\u201d\n\nThe best hires find the company\u2019s business goals motivational, Ms. McCord says. \u201cA big filter for hiring people at Netflix was, were they interested in our goal of making the customer happy?\u201d Ms. McCord says. She invited applicants to see the customer as someone like their mom\u2014not the engineer at the next desk, she says.\n\nMany employers post their cultural values on the wall but fail to make them explicit to job applicants, says S. Chris Edmonds, author of \u201cThe Culture Engine.\u201d This can easily lead to misfires. Some 7% of workers ages 24 to 36 say they dislike their employer\u2019s culture so much that they intend to quit their jobs in the next two years, according to a 2019 survey by Deloitte of 13,416 millennial employees.\n\nMore young workers are holding employers accountable for their values, and insisting that their companies stand for something, Mr. Edmonds says. Some 32% of millennials say businesses should try to reduce inequality and support better education, but only 16% of the employees say companies are actually doing so, the Deloitte survey shows. And while 27% of millennials think businesses should protect the environment, only 12% believe they\u2019re doing so.\n\nThe growing employee activism is marked by walkouts protesting employers\u2019 stance on the environment, immigration policy or use of their technology for military drone strikes. Some 38% of developers have approached their leadership with such misgivings or concerns, according to a recent HackerRank survey of 71,000 software developers.\n\nAll that promises to put more CEOs on the hot seat. As employees become more vocal, \u201cC-suite leaders will have to listen,\u201d Mr. Edmonds says. And that, he says, is a good thing: \u201cIt helps employers get clearer about, \u2018This is what we stand for.\u2019 \u201d\n\nDefining Cultural Fit\n\nWhat it is:\n\n\u2014Shared enthusiasm about a company\u2019s mission or purpose\n\n\u2014A common approach to working, together or individually\n\n\u2014A mutual understanding of how to make decisions and assess risk\n\nWhat it\u2019s not:\n\n\u2014A common educational, cultural or career background\n\n\u2014A sense of comfort and familiarity with co-workers\n\n\u2014Shared enjoyment of such perks as ping pong and craft beer\n\nWrite to Sue Shellenbarger at sue.shellenbarger@wsj.com", "description": "Employers often aim to hire people they think will be a good fit, but their efforts can easily veer into a ditch where new hires all look, think and act alike.", "authors": ["Sue Shellenbarger", "Sue.Shellenbarger Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108920/social", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
